    "### Abstract\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to predict votes of Supreme Court justices using oral argument transcripts. Studies in linguistics and psychology, as well as common sense, dictates that the word choices that people make convey crucial information about their beliefs and intentions with regard to issues. Rather than use precedents or formal analysis of the law to predict Supreme Court decisions, we attempt to extract essential emotional features of oral arguments made by justices and advocates in the court. Using aggregate data from 1946 to present"

There was an issue with different encodings: the txt documents are stored in Latin1 encoding when converted from PDFs to permit earlier functions to work, but when iterating through words there is some issues with how the words are decoded and passed to the stemmer. As a result, we need to manually convert incompatible strings to a tractable format. This conversion was not possible on a single document in our entire database, so we ultimately had to remove it from our database (if we didn't remove it, there would be an issue when we used the docketId from the document to index into a merged dataframe later on, we would have one more response variable than predictor variables). Stemming naturally can leave words as a non english word, or may incorrectly mistem a word. Nothing short of a large dictionary containing the stem of every possible word would accurately perform the stemming, so we are forced to accept this aggressive trimming."
