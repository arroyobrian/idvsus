    "### Abstract\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to predict votes of Supreme Court justices using oral argument transcripts. Studies in linguistics and psychology, as well as common sense, dictates that the word choices that people make convey crucial information about their beliefs and intentions with regard to issues. Rather than use precedents or formal analysis of the law to predict Supreme Court decisions, we attempt to extract essential emotional features of oral arguments made by justices and advocates in the court. Using aggregate data from 1946 to present"
