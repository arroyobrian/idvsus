ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH T. MAZIARZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MAZIARZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
More than 27 years ago in Belton this Court

20

applied its prior decisions in Chimel and Robinson to

21

the arrest of a recent occupant of an automobile.

22

Court sought to forge a workable straightforward rule

23

that could be easily applied and predictably enforced by

24

law enforcement officers in the field in this dangerous

25

and dynamic situation.

After careful consideration, this Court held

2

that the passenger compartment of the vehicle was deemed

3

to be under the immediate control of the arrestee.

4

Court also made clear that the search need only be a

5

contemporaneous incident of the arrest.

6

The

There are three reasons, all

7

well-established by this Court's case law, why officers,

8

law enforcement officers, need not demonstrate a threat

9

to their safety or need to preserve evidence prior to

10

searching an automobile incident to arrest, even if all

11

of the recent occupants of the vehicle have been

12

arrested and secured.

13

First, neither justification need exist in a

14

particular case.

15

that a search incident to arrest requires no additional

16

justification.

17

18

This Court has made clear in Robinson

It's the fact of arrest that justifies

Second, the search need only be a

19

contemporaneous incident of the arrest or substantially

20

contemporaneous with the arrest.

21

be contemporaneous even if the arrestee has been

22

secured.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Obviously a search can

But not if it occurred in

24

the station house, right, if the -- if the arrestee had

25

been taken into the station house?

MR. MAZIARZ:

Correct.

That would be remote

in time and location, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. MAZIARZ:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Or location.

Time and location, Your Honor.
Well, why isn't this

6

situation more like the station house than it is like -

7

the Belton situation is the police apprehend the -- a

8

driver.

9

assaulted.

They are concerned about weapons, about being
But here we have someone who is locked up

10

inside a police car, handcuffed, can't go anywhere.

11

That sounds to me more like the station house than it

12

does the urgent situation where the police have a

13

legitimate concern for their own safety.

14

MR. MAZIARZ:

The arrestee is still at the

15

same location at the scene of the arrest.

16

remote in place or time because it -- it -- the arrest

17

and the search occur in a short period of time at the

18

scene of the -- of the arrest.

19

arrestee is secured to one degree or another, in Belton

20

this Court wanted a workable, straightforward rule that

21

officers could apply across the board and not have to

22

look at particular facts and circumstances.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not

And while he -- the

So -

And this is important, but

24

you had three -- three points.

One was the fact of the

25

arrest; and, two, it must be contemporaneous.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

third?

2

MR. MAZIARZ:

The third is requiring a

3

justification is anathema to a bright-line rule.

4

that is precisely what this Court wanted in Belton, was

5

a rule that law-enforcement officers would know how to

6

apply from one case to another, that wouldn't vary based

7

upon the particular facts of the arrest.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

Well, we do have a -- we do

obviously require a justification for the bright-line

10

rule itself.

11

raises, I think, if anything more acutely than any of

12

the others that we've had recently, is that it seems if

13

-- if your position is -- is going to be accepted, to

14

divorce the search totally from the justification for

15

the Chimel rule.

16

And -- and the problem that this case

And -- and at some point we've either got to

17

say, all right, it's no longer a Chimel rule, there's

18

some other justification for the bright-line rule; or

19

we've got to say, to purport to apply the Chimel rule in

20

a case like this, handcuffed in the back of the police

21

car and so on, is -- is to turn the law into nonsense.

22

And -- and I -- I think we've got that

23

choice in front of us.

Do we have a new and different

24

rule, or do we apply Chimel and say, you just can't go

25

this far.

This is like the station house.

MR. MAZIARZ:

I think in Belton this Court

2

did apply Chimel and simply said, in this recurring

3

situation we need a bright-line rule that can be easily

4

determined and enforced by officers -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the bright line

6

swallows up the rationale in this hypothetical where

7

already he's handcuffed; he is in the car.

8

justification apart from Chimel for our keeping this

9

bright-line rule?

MR. MAZIARZ:

Is there a

The fact that officers have

for 27 years applied it; it's a workable rule.

That's not a long time.

What -- what was the situation when the Fourth Amendment

14

was adopted?

15

16

pulled him off to the side of the road, could you -

17

could you then go and search his carriage?

18

Do you know?

If you stopped Thomas

I'm struck by the fact that there is no

19

effort in your brief whatever to take this thing back

20

any more than 27 years.

21

could well be that it has always been considered

22

reasonable to search the person and to search the

23

conveyance from which the person has been taken.

24

Now, you know, it could -- it

If that's the case, I could say, gee, it's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, if you

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there other -- are

6

there other reasons that it's hazardous or dangerous or

7

at least risky to leave an unattended car where other

8

people can go in and maybe find weapons and contraband

9

if the police aren't guarding it?

I mean, are there

10

other reasons other than Chimel for this bright-line

11

rule?

12

MR. MAZIARZ:

Certainly, in -- in the case

13

of an automobile, which is different from the Chimel

14

home situation, if a vehicle is being left there.

15

this case the gun was on the front passenger seat of the

16

vehicle.

17

always true with an automobile.

18

Someone could readily access it.

In

That's

Officers obviously could take some steps to

19

try and secure the vehicle, lock it up or what-not.

20

that's not going to guarantee the fact that -- that the

by either other co-occupants who the officers have no

justification to arrest and secure or other people in

Quite simply there is no special

same complaints voiced by Justice Brennan in his dissent

reasonableness that -- that -- that officer safety -

officer summoned him and he knew the officers were there

drove by three -- three feet from them.

Police officers have been trained under

the commonly recurring incident of vehicle arrest and

2

3

authored both Chimel and Belton recognized that over a

4

decade of experience of Chimel had shown that the courts

5

were in disarray, that courts had confronted similar

6

fact circumstances and come to differing results, that

7

officers in the field, confronted with the highly

8

volatile and dangerous events surrounding a custodial

9

arrest needed clear guidance to be able to govern their

10

Justice Stewart who

actions in these instances.

11

That makes total sense.

Unlike Chimel which

12

occurred in a home and arises in a situation where the

13

privacy interests are at their apex, in the Belton

14

context, the search is of the passenger compartment of a

15

vehicle, and this Court has repeatedly acknowledged that

16

with respect to automobiles there is a considerably

17

diminished or greatly are reduced expectation of

18

privacy.

19

in discharging their duties on a day-to-day basis in

20

this commonly recurring scene -- circumstances, Belton

established a bright-line rule to be able to govern

22

their conduct.

Given the very real threats that officers face

problem with a bright-line rule with respect to trunks

8

and the Court simply didn't -- didn't address it.

9

10

And

Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I know -- I know you're not

but it just doesn't make sense to me to -- to abandon

the requirement that the -- that the officer's safety be

14

threatened and yet to say oh, but he can only search

15

the -- the passenger compartment.

16

reduced expectation of privacy for the automobile, you

17

arrest somebody you can search the automobile; what's

18

wrong with that?

19

MR. YANG:

If indeed there is

Certainly in another case, you

20

know, the Court can revisit the scope of Belton but I

21

think Belton as established certainly makes sense with

22

respect to the ambit of the passenger compartment.

23

notion what was within grabbing distance?

Even

that's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

5

York Court of Appeals in a portion quoted the Court by

danger that the arrestees could get to the vehicle, and

8

in fact Justice Brennan emphasized in dissent there was

no possibility that they could reach passenger

compartment.

What is the basis for your

12

wanting us to adopt what we might call a bright-line

other than officer safety which we think may not be a

17

safety is the question of the administrability of the

make rapid judgments about what is and what is not

permissible and in Belton the Court recognized that a

21

rule -- that rules based on the totality of the

22

circumstances, which require all kinds of ifs ands or

23

buts, simply are not workable; and that had been borne

24

out with 10 years of experience with Chimel being

perfectly workable to say that if the defendant has been

car -

5
6

MR. YANG:

Yes.

We believe the

bright-line -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why isn't it equally

8

workable to say when the defendant is handcuffed and put

Well, Justice Souter we think

11

that -- in some ways that does have the benefit of a

bright-line rule, but we don't believe that the -

13

that's a question of where you're going to draw that

14

line.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

And -- and we are

16

talking now about administeribility.

The police station

17

rule is administrable; it makes for a good bright-line

18

rule; why doesn't handcuffs in the back of the cruiser

19

make for an equally bright line?

20

MR. YANG:

We actually would draw the line a

21

little closer than the police station.

It would be when

22

the -- the search has begun after the suspect has been

23

removed from the scene.

24

administrability I guess that would provide for a

25

sufficiently bright-line rule but the problem is drawing

But in terms of

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the line at that point.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why wouldn't the rule of

3

requiring just the automobile exception, where you would

4

require probable cause to search a vehicle, why wouldn't

5

that be a bright line rule that would fit into

6

everything else.

7

MR. YANG:

It is, but the difference between

8

the probable cause exception and a search incident to

9

arrest is a search incident to arrest doctrine -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you more concerned

11

about the ability to search the vehicle or the

12

protection of the officer?

13
14

MR. YANG:

Well, certainly the protection of

the officer is what motivates the doctrine.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But doesn't -- don't these

16

rules apply to ordinary traffic arrests where there

17

really is very little risk to the officer?

18

MR. YANG:

Actually, Your Honor, very

are done.

We have to have a to

9

MR. JACOBS:

If we assume that that

assessment is something new, Mr. Chief Justice then we

11

are accepting without a basis Petitioner's

12

interpretation of Belton's bright-line rule as etch

13

tending beyond simply what is the permissible scope of

14

the search.

15

to the automobile situation Petitioner advocates a much

16

much too broad interpretation of this bright line rule

17

that arose out of Belton and -

Remembering that Belton only applied Chimel

out in one sentence which is the sentence that I read to

has to be overruled.

than the rule that, the case by case rule that you're

Well Justice Alito stare

That's right.

Stare decisus is

wrong, but you have to consider my point, Mr. Chief
Justice.
JUSTICE ALITO:

That's enough if we think

Belton was wrong that's enough for overruling it.
MR. JACOBS:

Yes and if the court is

14

considering it Mr. Justice Alito if we would like me to

15

answer the question assuming we should overrule Belton

16

why we should do it the answer is Chimel provides us

17

with sufficient tools for officers to protect their

18

safety in the field because you will recall there are

19

other ex-is hes to automobile searches with I have based

20

on actual grounds.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well are you saying do you

22

have any in my own mind perhaps differently from you I

think that the stare decisus is really brought into play

24

when you think the earlier decision was wrong.

25

MR. JACOBS:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

And at that point I'd still

need a reason why you should depart from that earlier

decision at the moment what the other side says is we

tell our police a simple thing.

we've trained a hundred thousand police officers to do

13

of reluctance.

14

MR. JACOBS:

What kinds of things you could

I understand, Justice Breyer,

15

and the answer is that -- two things:

16

and foremost, Belton's general assumption, which is

17

essentially required for the application of the

18

bright-line rule, is empirically not true.

19

procedures as we understand them today, routinely

20

arrestees are secured, they are handcuffed, they are

21

routinely placed in the back of patrol cruisers.

22

One, and first

With police

And even the amici for the Petitioner in

23

this case acknowledged that officers are not going to

24

deviate from those procedures just to make a search in

25

the future if the rule is changed, but primarily that,
43
Alderson Reporting Company

that the assumption that underlies Belton is not shown

2

to be empirically true.

It's empirically false.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. JACOBS:

Just not to get

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, one of the

really contentious issues at the time Belton decided is

whether you can search containers in the back in the

probable cause to believe anything in the car was

It was not just

strong privacy interest in containers in cars driven by

Belton.

MR. JACOBS:

I would agree with that

statement, Justice Stevens.

7
8

That's really what's at issue under

That's a correct statement.

And Buie is 1990, Your Honor.

My able staff

has provided the answers.

9

But we have to recall, Justices, that we are

10

at all times looking to the Fourth Amendment, its twin

11

exigencies, and the requirement that this Court has

12

consistently held, that in order to avoid a warrant,

13

there must be a clearly defined and limited exception to

the warrant requirement.

basis?

MR. JACOBS:

Belton only requires that if

the passenger compartment of the vehicle is arguably

2

occupant, that the police may contemporaneously search

the passenger compartment without regard for how far.
