 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. FLEMING: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The Court has been offered two ways to 

11

approach this case, a short way and a long way.  We 

12

believe we prevail under both and I will address both, 

13

but I would start with the short way, which we think is 

14

the right way.  This is a case about appellate 

15

jurisdiction 

16
17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 
hearts. 

18

 (Laughter.) 

19

 MR. FLEMING: 

20

You know the way to our 

I try to please, Justice 

Kennedy. 

21

 This is a case about appellate jurisdiction 

22

and specifically whether Congress has given the courts 

23

of appeals jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion 

24

to reopen that would be timely through the application 

25

of equitable tolling.  And that question is answered by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

Section 1252 of the INA, which creates jurisdiction over 

2

denials of motion to reopen as the Court confirmed in 

3

Kucana and it makes no distinction based on the grounds 

4

of the denial of the motion to reopen. 

5

 In this case the board denied Mr. Mata's 

6

motion as untimely, it ruled that equitable tolling was 

7

generally available, but that Mr. Mata was not entitled 

8

to it because it erroneously believed that his 

9

misdemeanor assault conviction qualified as a crime 

10

involving moral turpitude.  That legal error was 

11

reviewable.  It would have been reviewed in any other 

12

circuit.  It should have been reviewed here and the 

13

government agrees, and Mr. Peterson as amicus, does not 

14

mount any argument that that denial somehow does not 

15

fall within the jurisdictional grant of Section 1252. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can you explain why  on 

17

the surface, he beats up his girlfriend.  But why that 

18

is not a crime involving moral turpitude?  Because I had 

19

thought that the  the rest of this is academic if the 

20

bottom line is he's committed a crime of moral 

21

turpitude? 

22

 MR. FLEMING: 

Justice Ginsburg, first of 

23

all, that  that is a question that the First Circuit 

24

did not reach and we submit should have reached.  But to 

25

answer the question, the BIA has a very developed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

jurisprudence regarding when assault crimes qualify as 

2

crimes involving moral turpitude and it involves 

3

consideration of a number of factors. 

4

 It involves not only the level of injury 

5

that was either intended or caused, but also the level 

6

of intent.  And as the level of intent that is 

7

chargeable under the offense decreases from 

8

intentionality to, say, recklessness, then the level of 

9

bodily injury that is required has to concomitantly 

10
11

increase in order for it to constitute moral turpitude. 
 In Texas, the simple assault statute that 

12

Mr. Mata pled guilty under is not an aggravated assault 

13

statute.  It can be charged based only on bodily injury 

14

and that is defined in a purposely broad way, as the 

15

Texas court of appeals has stated, to include even 

16

injury caused by relatively minor physical contact. 

17

 So simple assault that can be charged under 

18

that provision is not turpitudeness and that's what the 

19

Board should have ruled and that was the argument that 

20

was presented to the Fifth Circuit, but the Fifth 

21

Circuit determined that it did not have jurisdiction to 

22

decide. That is the issue we've asked this Court to 

23

review.  Of course, it does not need to go into the 

24

turpitudeness or not quality of the offense under 

25

Section 2201(a)(1)of the Texas Penal Code.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Because this is a jurisdictional question, 

2

there is no need to go further to the issues that Mr. 

3

Peterson is raising regarding whether there is equitable 

4

tolling as a matter of merits under the INA.  We don't 

5

think it's necessary.  We think the Fifth Circuit can 

6

address that if appropriate, if it chooses to on remand. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What if 
Well, wait 
Wouldn't the Fifth 

10

Circuit need to be  I mean, the Fifth Circuit view was 

11

no equitable tolling, period.  The statute says 90 days. 

12

It has a couple of exceptions and that's it.  So if we 

13

simply say you have jurisdiction, the  the answer 

14

would likely be fine, you told us we have jurisdiction. 

15

We think this limitation period has no give, end of 

16

case. 

17

 MR. FLEMING: 

Justice Ginsburg, we don't 

18

think that's what the Fifth Circuit did in this case or 

19

in any other.  In this case, the Court specifically 

20

disavowed any ruling on the merits of the equitable 

21

tolling claim.  It simply dismissed the petition for 

22

lack of jurisdiction.  Notably, the BIA in 2012 in a 

23

case called ChavezGuzman, which we cite in our reply, 

24

recognized that the Fifth Circuit has not addressed in a 

25

published decision whether the motion time limitations

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

may be equitably tolled in cases claiming 

2

ineffectiveness of counsel. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why did  why did the 

4

Fifth Circuit treat this, therefore, as a  as it 

5

requested review the sua sponte extension granted below? 

6

 MR. FLEMING: 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's 
Why  why would it have 

8

done that if it  if it thought that, in fact, there 

9

was some argument about whether  whether they could 

10

appeal the denial of extension in law as opposed to in 

11

the sua sponte discretion of the agency? 

12

 MR. FLEMING: 

It's  there are two stages 

13

to the answer, Justice Scalia.  And it's regrettable 

14

that the decisions that issue from the Fifth Circuit do 

15

not  they have conclusory statements in them and not a 

16

lot of reasoning. 

17

 First of all, you have the unpublished 

18

decisions which say that the circuit will construe a 

19

request for equitable tolling as a request for sua 

20

sponte reopening. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why?  Why would one do 

that? 
 MR. FLEMING: 

So my best reading of them 

24

and again, the reasoning is sparse.  They say that in 

25

their view, equitable tolling is not a basis for filing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1
2
3
4

a motion after 90 days.  Now, because they have not 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Which means there 

there's no equitable tolling. 
 MR. FLEMING: 

I  I  now, that's not 

5

something that they've ever adopted in a published 

6

decision.  I think one reading of that  and this is 

7

the reading the government, I think, endorses or at the 

8

very least there's a dispute about it  is that the 

9

Fifth Circuit was saying the statue and the regulations 

10

on their terms do not use the words "equitable tolling." 

11

That, of course, does not resolve the fundamental 

12

question whether as a matter of statutory 

13

interpretation 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

 MR. FLEMING: 

Sure. 
 or as a matter of 

16

administrative authority equitable tolling can be 

17

applied. 

18

 But I  I want to be clear, we  we do not 

19

fear this question at all.  And if the Court wishes to 

20

reach the merits issues that Mr. Peterson has put before 

21

the Court, we are happy to fight on that ground.  We 

22

simply want it to be plain that we didn't present the 

23

the jurisdictional question as including a merits 

24

question.  If the Court thinks it needs to be decided, 

25

then the Court has the briefing and I'm prepared to talk

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1
2

about it. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you acknowledge that 

3

if  if you view this as the Fifth Circuit viewed it, 

4

as a request to review the sua sponte extension granted 

5

by the agency, that the Fifth Circuit would have had no 

6

jurisdiction over that? 

7

 MR. FLEMING: 

We do not, Justice Scalia. 

8

And I just want to be clear the context in which I 

9

answer that question.  That requires a lot of steps 

10

before the Court even gets to that.  First of all, it 

11

not only requires getting to the merits issues, it 

12

requires rejecting our primary  our contention on the 

13

merits, which is that as a matter of statutory 

14

interpretation, this is tollable.  It requires rejecting 

15

the government's position that at the very least, the 

16

statute does not prohibit the board from implementing 

17

the 90day time limit by using equitable tolling.  And 

18

if you get to that point such that you're in a 

19

throughthelookingglass world where the board was, in 

20

fact, not doing what it thought it was doing, namely, 

21

exercising authority under the statute, but instead, 

22

exercising regulatory sua sponte authority, then you get 

23

to the question, are there judicially manageable 

24

standards to review what the board, in fact, did in this 

25

case?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

 And there clearly are. 

They have  they're 

2

being reviewed in every other circuit when there is a 

3

request for equitable tolling based on ineffective 

4

assistance of counsel.  The equitable tolling standards 

5

are well settled under this Court's decision in Pace v. 

6

DiGuglielmo.  The ineffective assistance standards are 

7

well settled by the board's own Lozada decision. 

8
9

 Now, it may well be that there are other 
situations where the board simply says request denied 

10

and that may be a situation where jurisdiction would be 

11

in doubt.  But if you are talking about a case like this 

12

one where the board writes an opinion that says, here 

13

are the standards we are applying and we believe that 

14

the Petitioner is ineligible for equitable tolling 

15

because his conviction is for a crime involving moral 

16

turpitude, that is a legal question that is reviewable, 

17

regardless of how you caption the authority under which 

18

the board is acting. 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, I've  I've 

20

forgotten, but is there a circuit split on that third 

21

on the sua sponte review? 

22

 MR. FLEMING: 

There is no circuit split as 

23

such because every other circuit believes, as we think 

24

is correct, that this kind of decision is reviewable as 

25

a matter of statutory authority.  And that's what the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

board is doing.  That's what the board itself thinks 

2

it's doing.  So every other circuit to have decided the 

3

issue does say it has jurisdiction to review this kind 

4

of decision.  They don't call it sua sponte. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do we make it clear 

6

to the Fifth Circuit?  We say Fifth Circuit, you have 

7

jurisdiction.  They say fine.  We said before and we say 

8

again that this statute is not susceptible to equitable 

9

tolling and then we're right back where we are. 

10

 MR. FLEMING: 

If that is, in fact, what the 

11

Fifth Circuit does, then it may well be, because then 

12

there would be a clear circuit split on the merits 

13

question of the availability of equitable tolling.  I 

14

would hold out hope that the Fifth Circuit would not 

15

create that circuit split; that when disabused of the 

16

belief that it lacks jurisdiction, it would then engage 

17

in the analysis that we and the government believe it 

18

should engage in and find that like every other circuit 

19

to have addressed the issue, there is, in fact, 

20

equitable tolling available and would address Mr. Mata's 

21

request for it on the merits. 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, it knew at the time 

23

it rendered its decision that the other circuits were 

24

taking a different position on whether the 90day period 

25

was susceptible to extension.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

 MR. FLEMING: 

It did, Your Honor.  The panel 

2

felt  felt itself bound by prior precedent on the 

3

jurisdictional question.  This is why I don't think 

4

fundamentally that it reached a decision in this case or 

5

in any published opinion on the merits of that. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm not sure  did the 

7

First Circuit say it has no jurisdiction to review 

8

the  the statutory question? 

9
10

 MR. FLEMING: 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The 
I thought all it did was, 

11

since there is no tolling under the statute, we're going 

12

to interpret this as a sua sponte thing, and the only 

13

question before them is whether that sua sponte thing 

14

conferred jurisdiction or not.  Isn't that what 

15

happened? 

16
17

 MR. FLEMING: 

It  I  I don't think so, 

Justice Scalia. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MR. FLEMING: 

Okay. 
I think if that had happened, 

20

if that was really what the Fifth Circuit meant to do, 

21

then it should have assumed jurisdiction over our 

22

request for statutory tolling.  It should have denied 

23

the petition to that extent, and then it could have 

24

dismissed the request for sua sponte reopening.  But it 

25

didn't do that.  It dismissed the entire thing for lack

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

of jurisdiction, which is why we think there is no 

2

merits ruling here that the Court needs to reach. 

3

 Again, however, I say that if the Court 

4

wishes to reach it, we believe the answer is clear and 

5

correct under this Court's precedence that the 90day 

6

time limit is a statute of limitations, and that it 

7

should be  there is no reason to think that the 

8

presumption of tolling either doesn't apply or has been 

9

rebutted.

this goes back to the Fifth Circuit. 
 MR. FLEMING: 

This should go back to the 

17

Fifth Circuit, and the question is simply that Mr. 

18

Peterson has raised is, what does it go back with?  Does 

19

it go back solely with directions that the court has 

20

jurisdiction and everything else should be addressed by 

21

the  the Fifth Circuit in the first instance, or does 

22

it go back with a decision that, in addition to there 

23

being jurisdiction, there is also equitable tolling, and 

24

then the Fifth Circuit can address the question on the 

25

merits.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG 

6

Mr. Yang. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

7

 IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL AND REMAND 

8

 MR. YANG: 

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The court of appeals here rested its 

11

decision on a basic and fundamental error of 

12

administrative law.  Rather than review the board's 

13

decision on its own terms, the court of appeals 

14

recharacterized the question before it into a different 

15

question over which it lacked jurisdiction.  That course 

16

is inconsistent with the Chenery rule, which, since even 

17

before the APA, required that judicial review of agency 

18

action be based on the rationale adopted by the agency. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But the way you put it 

20

causes me to believe that you agreed that the Fifth 

21

Circuit would have had no jurisdiction. 

22

 MR. YANG: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24
25

We 
If indeed it was the sua 

sponte action that they were reviewing. 
 MR. YANG: 

That's right.  We disagree with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

Petitioner on this point 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 MR. YANG: 

On that point. 
But we don't think it affects the 

4

disposition here.  Also I would note that every single 

5

court of appeals with jurisdiction over immigration 

6

cases agrees with our position.  There is no circuit 

7

split because it's unanimous in our favor. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And Mr. Yang, could you 

point me to the place in the board's decision that you 

10

think makes clear what the board was doing?  Because as 

11

I looked at the board's decision, honestly, I found it a 

12

little bit difficult to tell whether the board was 

13

denying it on statutory grounds or on sua sponte 

14

grounds. 

15

 MR. YANG: 

I agree with you that the board's 

16

decision could be a little bit more clear.  Some 

17

background is helpful. 

18

 This is a question of equitable tolling for 

19

ineffective assistance of counsel.  That's the claim. 

20

And so that claim embodies at least four requirements. 

21

One, you have to have normal equitable tolling 

22

satisfied. 

23

 You have to also show ineffective 

24

assistance, and that has subparts, including prejudice 

25

from the ineffective assistance, and you have to show

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

that you've met the requirements of the Lozada decision, 

2

which has certain procedural showings that have to be 

3

made. 

4

 Now, in order to get to equitable tolling, 

5

you therefore have to show prejudice.  And if you look 

6

at Petition Appendix 7, after talking about Lozada in 

7

the first full paragraph, in the second paragraph, they 

8

say, you know, in Lozada, although the resulting 

9

summary  there was a summary dismissal of appeal, did 

10

not amount to a deprivation of due process and was not 

11

prejudicial. 

12

 And then with respect to prejudice, they 

13

explain on two bases, the decision here, or the alleged 

14

ineffective assistance was not prejudicial, one, because 

15

it was not a crime of  there was a crime of moral 

16

turpitude which precluded relief; and, two, the alien 

17

failed to submit at the motion to reopen stage, evidence 

18

showing that there was exceptional and extremely unusual 

19

hardship. 

20

 All of that goes to prejudice, which goes to 

21

the tolling question.  And the predicate, of course, was 

22

the statement earlier that the time for filing a motion 

23

to reopen may be tolled in cases of ineffective 

24

assistance of counsel, but then they were just focusing 

25

on the second.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

 So the way that we read the board, which I 

2

think is the way the board has decided these cases 

3

generally is that the questions of ineffective 

4

assistance and equitable tolling here are kind of mixed. 

5

And the board's decision addressed the  the prejudice 

6

prong of that  those requirements. 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I somehow have the 

8

impression, I don't know, the AG is going to have some 

9

kind of rulemaking relevant to this. 

10

 MR. YANG: 

There is pending rulemaking, as 

11

we noted in our brief.  There is a notice of proposed 

12

rulemaking that the Department has submitted to OMD that 

13

is expected to, you know, hopefully go forward. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Rulemaking has to do with 

15

the existence or nonexistence of equitable tolling under 

16

this provision? 

17

 MR. YANG: 

18

The rulemaking, of course, is not 

public, but what I can tell you 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

 MR. YANG: 

Yes. 
 is that the  in the Compean 

21

decision, the Attorney General addressed generally 

22

questions of ineffective assistance of counsel.  One of 

23

the components of that was equitable tolling of the 

24

deadline for ineffective assistance.  It would be 

25

logical to assume that because the  that Compean

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

ruling was vacated in favor of the rulemaking, the 

2

rulemaking scope could be similar to the Attorney 

3

General's decision. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So on that assumption, that 

5

would, as I understand it, give the Fifth Circuit 

6

something new to think about in  in addressing this 

7

question; is that right? 

8
9

 MR. YANG: 

It certainly would, and it would 

also have the benefit, on remand, of the government's 

10

clear view that there is equitable tolling here, 

11

although not applicable to this alien, but just 

12

generally equitable tolling is available as all the 

13

courts of appeals have decided.  And as we note in our 

14

brief, we don't think the Fifth Circuit is precluded 

15

even at the panel level from reaching that decision. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Would the  would the 

17

Fifth Circuit, with this rulemaking, you can't tell us 

18

what it is at this stage, this early stage, would it be 

19

available, will they have a rule should we remand this 

20

case to the Fifth Circuit? 

21

 MR. YANG: 

I think it's unlikely there's 

22

going to be a final rule by the time this Court's 

23

decision is issued.  The unified agenda projects a 

24

notice of proposed rulemaking being issued late this 

25

year.  And then the notice and comment period would have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

to elapse, and we'd have to get to a final rule.  So I 

2

don't think by the time June rolls around, we'll get the 

3

final rule.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm  I'm sorry, but there 

would be an NPR when?  Late this calendar year? 
 MR. YANG: 

Late this calendar year.  That's 

what the unified agenda projects. 
 So  but again, I don't think sending this 
case back on the very basic point that the Fifth Circuit 

10

can't sidestep its obligation to review a motion to 

11

reopen by characterizing it as something that it's not, 

12

would wipe the slate clean.  The Fifth Circuit in its 

13

first  in an earlier unpublished decision, in fact, 

14

found that there was equitable tolling and reversed the 

15

board to apply equitable tolling.  Only later did it 

16

change course without any reasoning and assert, again 

17

with zero reasoning, that there was not equitable 

18

tolling, and then adopted this construal rule. 

19

 But the construal rule itself is just 

20

fundamentally into the teeth of the Chenery doctrine. 

21

And had the court of appeals recognized that what it had 

22

to review was the denial of the alien's motion to 

23

reopen, it would have had jurisdiction.  And it doesn't 

24

matter, you know, amicus has tried to  I think 

25

artfully tried to recharacterize this jurisdictional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

question into a question of the merits, but the answer 

2

to the merits doesn't affect the jurisdiction. 

3

 If you were to assume, as the amicus has 

4

argued, that there is no equitable tolling in this 

5

context because the statute precludes it, that would not 

6

be a jurisdictional problem.  What it would mean is that 

7

the court of appeals would simply affirm the board on 

8

the merits; that is affirm the board's denial of a 

9

motion to reopen, because there can be no equitable 

10

tolling. 

11

 Again, we come back to the  this case is a 

12

very simple case.  It's an appropriate case to end the 

13

term on; it's quick, it's easy.  The court of appeals 

14

should have simply done what courts of appeals do all 

15

the time when they're conducting agency review, a review 

16

of agency action; that is, review the action before it 

17

and not recharacterize it into something that it's not. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, to be fair to 

19

the Fifth Circuit, I mean, I can't put myself in their 

20

mind, but I think they may well have been trying to give 

21

Mr. Mata the benefit of the doubt or give him every 

22

chance.  I mean, they say it's equitable tolling but, 

23

you know, you're not going to get equitable tolling, so 

24

that's no relief.  And since you can't get it, maybe 

25

you're trying to get something else.  And so we'll look

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

at whether you get something else, and then too bad, it 

2

turns out you don't get that either. 

3

 MR. YANG: 

Well, I won't speculate what 

4

to  what the court of appeals' motivations might have 

5

been for its ruling, but the ruling itself is again just 

6

fundamentally into the teeth of Chenery.  It's true that 

7

whencourts are addressing a pleading that's filed 

8

before the court, itself, the court can say, well, I'm 

9

going to read this generously.  They do this in certain 

10

contexts. 

11

 But when you're conducting review of agency 

12

action, the rule that has always existed in the modern 

13

APA era has been you look to what the agency has done. 

14

And when you look to what the agency has done here, it 

15

addressed and rejected the alien's motion to reopen. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Just to try to be a little 

17

bit generous to the Fifth Circuit, again, I mean, I 

18

started off by saying, I found it a little bit hard to 

19

tell what the agency was doing.  And you presented a 

20

very good explanation, but it's an explanation that 

21

actually requires some background knowledge, and I'm not 

22

sure that they would have gotten that from just looking 

23

at the face of the thing. 

24
25

 MR. YANG: 

And I don't mean to  to fault 

the Fifth Circuit.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, I mean, you can't 

2

really  Chenery can't really operate very well if you 

3

can't figure it out. 

4

 MR. YANG: 

Well, that's true.  But the 

5

that is true, but the answer then is always to remand. 

6

If you can't discern what the  the course of the 

7

agency's decision is, the other established rule is you 

8

remand. And, you know, the  this is not an unfamiliar 

9

question to the courts.  Generally, if you can discern, 

10

even if it's in a cryptic way, what  what the  the 

11

alien's  excuse me  the agency's path in an agency 

12

decision, you review that.  If you 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is it true that the 

14

the  the agency, the BIA, has, a number of times, 

15

recognized the existence of equitable tolling of this 

16

90day period, but has never done so in a 

17

precedential opinion? 

18

 MR. YANG: 

That  that is correct.  That is 

19

correct.  It  there is no precedential opinion.  There 

20

was, of course, the Attorney General's opinion in 

21

Compean, which addressed both the standards for 

22

ineffective assistance claims, as well as the 

23

application of equitable tolling for cases involving 

24

ineffective assistance.  So the AG made that ruling, and 

25

it's a way that's consistent with, I think, the  what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

we've articulated in the brief.  That was vacated in 

2

lieu of what  what we will now have, which is a 

3

rulemaking process to address the questions.  So there 

4

is no precedent, although the Attorney General has 

5

briefly spoken on the issue.

7

 If there's no further questions, I'm going 
to

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 MR. YANG:

Thank you, counsel. 

Thank you. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. Peterson. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. PETERSON 
 ON BEHALF OF THE COURTAPPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE, 

13

 SUPPORTING THE JUDGMENT BELOW 

14

 MR. PETERSON: 

15
16

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 We agree with the government that orders 

17

denying statutory motions to reopen are reviewable in 

18

the courts of appeals, and we agree with the government 

19

that orders of the board denying invitations for the 

20

board to reopen sua sponte are not reviewable in the 

21

courts of appeals because they're committed to agency 

22

discretion by law. 

23

 Where we part ways with the government is on 

24

how you distinguish between the two of them.  And we 

25

offer what we think is the easiest test, which is the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

timeliness.  If an alien asks the board to reopen within 

2

the statutory deadline, within the 90 days, he has a 

3

right to reopening that is reviewable under Kucana if 

4

the board denies it. 

5

 On the other hand, if the alien requests 

6

reopening after the expiration of the 90day statutory 

7

period, the board is not obligated to grant reopening in 

8

those circumstances.  The board could grant reopening 

9

only through its exercise of its sua sponte authority, 

10

and as a result, that decision is wholly in the board's 

11

discretion. 

12

 Now, the government turns to Chenery to 

13

suggest a rule that courts must always characterize 

14

agency decisions in precisely the way the agencies did. 

15

This Court, we think, rejected that argument in 

16

Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers where it explained 

17

that Chenery has nothing whatever to do with whether 

18

agency action is reviewable.  So we see Brotherhood as a 

19

remarkably analogous case.  There the request being made 

20

of the commission was to reconsider a previous decision, 

21

and the court distinguished between two types of ways 

22

that a party could ask the commission to change one of 

23

its earlier decisions. 

24
25

 It could file a motion for reconsideration, 
simply suggesting that the law was wrong, the earlier

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

decision was simply incorrect on the same record.  The 

2

court held that that is not reviewable.  Or the party 

3

could file a motion to reopen with new evidence 

4

attached, which would be reviewable.  And what the court 

5

said was that in determining whether the court of 

6

appeals had jurisdiction over the petition for review, 

7

it didn't need to focus on how the agency characterized 

8

its order.  It could focus on whether that order was 

9

reviewable. 

10

 So in this case, Petitioner acknowledges 

11

that if equitable tolling is unavailable, his motion to 

12

reopen was untimely.  If he filed 115 days, his only 

13

argument in favor of timeliness is equitable tolling. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I'm  I'm a 

15

little concerned because we do have to, on some levels, 

16

address the question of whether a sua  sua sponte 

17

decision not to  not to reopen is  is reviewable. 

18

I  I think as a general matter, one could say that 

19

given the vast discretion that the BIA gets in denying, 

20

that one should basically defer to their decisions in 

21

sua sponte reopenings.  But occasionally, they do it not 

22

as an exercise of discretion, but as an erroneous 

23

interpretation of law.  And there's plenty of standards 

24

to correcting that.  And so even for me, in sua sponte 

25

openings  and I do understand I'm probably on a losing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

slope  and I think that's what the  the board is 

2

basically saying.  It's a matter of  of deciding 

3

whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel, and 

4

we have a right and this is the standard we're going to 

5

set.  Lozada sets the standard that we're going to look 

6

at, and for that reason, there is equitable tolling. 

7

That's basically all they're saying, in my judgment. 

8

 MR. PETERSON: 

Your Honor, we disagree that 

9

Lozada sets the standard for ineffective assistance of 

10

counsel.  We believe that Lozada sets the standard for 

11

how an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be 

12

raised. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You're right.  How it 

14

but here, they basically said it  you didn't have due 

15

diligence, I believe, and so you failed the 

16

prerequisites. 

17

 MR. PETERSON: 

Your Honor, we would disagree 

18

that in this case, the board actually construed 

19

Petitioner as asking for equitable tolling.  And there's 

20

a reason for that, which is that Petitioner did not ask 

21

for equitable tolling before the Board of Immigration 

22

Appeals.  His initial motion to reopen does not 

23

acknowledge its untimeliness.  It says nothing about 

24

untimeliness at all.  He mentions, in his reply in 

25

support of the  motion to reopen, that it is not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

untimely if there are exceptional circumstances.  You 

2

will not find the phrase "equitable tolling" in any of 

3

the papers the Petitioner filed with the Board of 

4

Immigration 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

6

 MR. PETERSON: 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, who was he 
 Appeals. 
 represented by at that 

8

stage?  I mean, is  this is a case involving 

9

ineffective assistance of counsel when he brought the 

10
11

at  at what stage was there competent counsel? 
 MR. PETERSON: 

Justice Ginsburg, my 

12

understanding is that  Petitioner's current theory is that 

13

he was represented by competent counsel when he retained 

14

new counsel after the board's initial denial of his 

15

appeal.  That was October 10th, 19 days after the 

16

board's decision.  You'll see 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What we have here is a 

18

question that we agreed to review.  The question is 

19

whether the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in this 

20

case in holding it has no jurisdiction to review 

21

Petitioner's request that the board equitably tolled the 

22

90day deadline on his motion to reopen as a result of 

23

ineffective assistance of counsel.  We granted review on 

24

that. 

25

 As far as what the Fifth Circuit said, among

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

other things it says, it lacks jurisdiction to review 

2

the BIA's denial of Mata's untimely motion to reopen, 

3

and so it need not address the merits.  Now, it said 

4

other things, too, which tend to support you as going on 

5

this other ground, but it did say that.  And you read, 

6

at least somewhat possibly, you could say he did ask the 

7

board to equitably toll his motion.  And the board said, 

8

no, we won't equitably do that because it's not going to 

9

make any difference, basically.  You weren't really 

10

prejudiced. 

11

 Okay. 

Given all that, why should we decide 

12

a different question?  Why don't we decide the question 

13

that we said we would decide?  And if we're going to 

14

decide the question we said we'd decide, I would think 

15

the answer is pretty clear.  They did have jurisdiction 

16

to review it.  They can review it and say the board was 

17

right because they have a lot of discretion here, 

18

et cetera, or for whatever reason, because there is no 

19

equitable tolling, whatever they want to say.  I 

20

wouldn't guess that. 

21

 But I've never heard of any precedent that 

22

would  I can't think of one that would suggest that 

23

when an agency does something like this, requests 

24

equitably to toll, denied, appeal, that a court of 

25

appeals wouldn't consider whether they're right or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

wrong.  I mean, what  what  if we get to that 

2

question, is there any case?  No, because I thought 

3

normally, courts of appeals do review that kind of 

4

question.  You may have a weak argument, but then 

5

they'll review it.  They'll say no. 

6

 MR. PETERSON: 

Justice Breyer, as we 

7

understand what the Fifth Circuit did here, the Fifth 

8

Circuit has already established in its jurisprudence 

9

that equitable tolling is unavailable for statutory 

10
11

motions. 
 I know Petitioner now takes a different 

12

view.  I point you to Petitioner's arguments before the 

13

court of appeals in his reply brief on page 8 where he 

14

asked the court of appeals to reexamine its holding in 

15

RamosBonilla that motions to reopen are not subject to 

16

equitable tolling.  So at least before the court of 

17

appeals, Petitioner saw the Fifth Circuit's 

18

jurisprudence the same way that we did. 

19

 Now, because, in the Fifth Circuit, 

20

equitable tolling of the 90day deadline is unavailable, 

21

the Board of Immigration Appeals could have granted 

22

relief only by exercising its sua sponte authority to 

23

reopen.  That is the only basis on which the Board of 

24

Immigration Appeals could have reopened in this case. 

25

Therefore, the Board of Immigration Appeals' decision

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

whether or not to reopen is a decision that is committed 

2

to agency discretion by law. 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but normally 

4

it's a  a circuit precedent establishing a particular 

5

rule on the merits doesn't operate as a bar to 

6

jurisdiction.  I mean  I mean, they may give you a 

7

very short order citing the decision that controls the 

8

precedent in the particular case, but they certainly 

9

have jurisdiction in reviewing. 

10

 For example, I mean, let's suppose you've 

11

got an argument that you want to overturn the precedent. 

12

They would have had jurisdiction to do that. 

13

 MR. PETERSON: 

Mr. Chief Justice, we think 

14

the difference here is that the deadline isn't simply a 

15

question of whether the board was right or wrong in 

16

denying the statutory motion.  We see the timeliness as 

17

the key distinction between whether the board's 

18

discretion was unfettered on reopening or fettered on 

19

reopening.  And so the first question as we see it 

20

that is how we distinguish orders denying statutory 

21

motions to reopen from orders denying motions to reopen 

22

sua sponte. 

23

 And so the first question we would say that 

24

a court of appeals would need to address is whether the 

25

alien's motion to reopen before the Board of Immigration

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1
2

Appeals was timely. 
 If that motion was untimely, then it rested 

3

solely in the board's discretion whether to grant or 

4

deny reopening.  And for that reason, under Heckler v. 

5

Chaney, under Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the 

6

Fifth Circuit properly dismissed for lack of 

7

jurisdiction. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you deny that the 

plaintiff here  that Petitioner thought that he was 

10

asking for equitable tolling?  Because I guess  I 

11

guess this is very similar to the Chief Justice's 

12

question, but it seems to me if somebody comes in and he 

13

says, I'm entitled to equitable tolling, and the court 

14

thinks, no, you're not, equitable tolling is 

15

unavailable.  Then what the court should do is something 

16

like this.  It should first say, sorry, equitable 

17

tolling is not available. 

18

 Now, is there a different way we can 

19

construe your petition?  Oh, maybe there is.  We can 

20

construe it as a sua sponte decision.  Now in the end 

21

that's going to lead you to the same results because we 

22

don't have jurisdiction over that, but that that's the 

23

proper order of things.  You know, first we'll say, oop, 

24

sorry you lose equitable tolling is unavailable, and 

25

then we'll do whatever construing we can do to see if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

there are any alternative avenues, and then we decide 

2

there are not. 

3

 MR. PETERSON: 

Well, Justice Kagan we 

4

believe that's what the Fifth Circuit did, albeit 

5

implicitly.  I point to page 3 of the Petition Appendix: 

6

We lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of 

7

Mata's untimely motion to reopen. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, but there's a  there 

9

is something, and this is what the Chief Justice was 

10

saying, too.  There is something that the court does 

11

have jurisdiction over and it's the question of whether 

12

equitable tolling was available.  That's a merits 

13

question, I have jurisdiction over whether equitable 

14

tolling is available.  I say it's not or I say it is; 

15

doesn't matter, I have jurisdiction over that question 

16

either way. 

17

 MR. PETERSON: 

The court of appeals 

18

certainly always has jurisdiction to determine whether 

19

it has jurisdiction.  So on the way to a jurisdictional 

20

ruling 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's not determining whether 

22

it has jurisdiction.  That  whether equitable tolling 

23

is available or is unavailable is  is not itself a 

24

jurisdictional question.  That's a merits question. 

25

 And then when you decide that it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

unavailable you can say, okay, is there another way to 

2

construe the thing, and that ends  that lands you in a 

3

jurisdictional question as to whether you have 

4

jurisdiction over sua sponte decisions. 

5

 MR. PETERSON: 

Justice Kagan, as we've tried 

6

to suggest it, the timeliness is related to the 

7

jurisdiction, because the timeliness of the motion to 

8

reopen tells you whether the board's order denying 

9

reopening is an order that was solely in the board's 

10
11

discretion or not. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well  it's really 

12

you're taking a merits first.  You decide the merits and 

13

then we say, then there's no jurisdiction.  This is 

14

this is what  whatever the rule is  as you recognize, 

15

is a claimprocessing rule.  You  that rule needs to be 

16

interpreted whether it has any give. 

17

 But it's  it's  there's jurisdiction to 

18

decide that question.  I think you agree that there is 

19

jurisdiction in the Fifth Circuit to decide whether or 

20

not this 90day limit can be equitably tolled. 

21

 MR. PETERSON: 

Your Honor, yes, Justice 

22

Ginsburg, we do agree the Fifth Circuit can decide 

23

that  has decided it, and as a result of deciding 

24

that, did properly reach the judgement it reached in 

25

this case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But you see there's a little 

2

bit of a problem with the way the Fifth Circuit is going 

3

about this thing, because what the Fifth Circuit has 

4

done is to say that equitable tolling is unavailable and 

5

the only time it ever uttered those words is in an 

6

unpublished opinion.  And in all the published opinions 

7

it's just said, you know, we're construing this as 

8

something else and we have no jurisdiction over that. 

9

And what that effectively has done is to insulate from 

10

our review the determination that the Fifth Circuit has 

11

made, if the Fifth Circuit has made it, that equitable 

12

tolling is unavailable. 

13

 MR. PETERSON:

Justice Scalia, when 

It's a good question,

 MR. PETERSON: 

Thank you.  When the Fifth

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

Circuit in RamosBonilla adopted the second half of 

2

adopted the construal rule from Lin v. Mukasey, we think 

3

the Fifth Circuit necessarily adopted the premise for 

4

that construal rule as well. 

5

 So when the Fifth Circuit quotes Lin v. 

6

Mukasey for the proposition that an argument seeking 

7

equitable tolling is in essence an argument that the BIA 

8

should have exercised its discretion to reopen sua 

9

sponte, we think that RamosBonilla necessarily adopted 

10

Lin's premise of that, that equitable tolling is not a 

11

basis for filing an untimely or numerically barred 

12

motion. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:

 JUSTICE BREYER:

follow what I think is the fairly simple thing of the 

17

question presented, you announce two things that I think 

18

there's a huge argument about. 

19

 One is whether there is court review of the 

20

sua sponte thing because, as you probably know, there 

21

has been a long argument for 40 years about the meaning 

22

of that first part of the APA in Davis; or somebody 

23

says, well, when they say there's no court review when 

24

you commit a matter of discretion to the agency by law, 

25

of course there isn't.  They're acting lawfully.  But

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

you can still get review of whether they acted as an 

2

abuse of that discretion.  Of course.  And I think you 

3

can. 

4

 But I understand there are different points 

5

on that.  Do we really want to open up that big 

6

question? 

7

And as far as the other question you want us 

8

to open up about whether this is statutorily 

9

forbidden  you say whether  whether equitable 

10

tolling is forbidden here, again there are two views. 

11

Lots of the circuits think, no, it isn't, and moreover 

12

the SG thinks that, moreover they're having a rulemaking 

13

on that in a year or so that could encompass that, but 

14

it's secret.  But nonetheless  nonetheless it might. 

15

 And  and so we're getting into what's 

16

actually I think a tough question.  And maybe it's 

17

cowardly.  But I'm thinking why go into those two tough 

18

questions, when in fact we asked for the answer to a 

19

simple question.  There are  you have written a very 

20

good brief and I understand what you're doing and  but 

21

I still am sort of stuck on this, which I'll put to you. 

22

 MR. PETERSON: 

Well, thank you, Justice 

23

Breyer.  I know it's the end of the term and I'm asking 

24

you to complicate the case 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

37
1

 MR. PETERSON: 

But let me point out though 

2

that the Solicitor General might agree that equitable 

3

tolling is available, but agrees with us that every 

4

court of appeals other than the Fifth Circuit to have 

5

addressed the availability of equitable tolling has 

6

gotten its analysis wrong.  The Solicitor General agrees 

7

with us that the presumption of equitable tolling is 

8

inapplicable to these sorts of statutes. 

9

 Every court of appeals to have reached this, 

10

as Petitioner does, reaches the result that equitable 

11

tolling is available through the presumption of 

12

equitable tolling.  And now the Solicitor General 

13

suggests that the administrative rulemaking might 

14

provide a solution to this.  Well, in at least two 

15

circuits, and likely more, that's been foreclosed.  If 

16

you look at the Second Circuit's decision in Iavorski, 

17

the Ninth Circuit's decision in SocaGonzalez, both of 

18

them note that Board of Immigrations Appeals' position 

19

is that equitable tolling is unavailable.  Both of them 

20

conclude that the statute unambiguously requires 

21

equitable tolling and reject deference to the agency. 

22

 So to the extent that you have 

23

administrative rulemaking here, as best I can 

24

understand, the Fifth Circuit is the only circuit that 

25

would actually be able to even potentially give effect

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1
2

to it.  And 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I'm totally 

3

confused.  I  I think what the agency is saying, at 

4

least in this situation, is there is no explicit command 

5

in the statute about equitable tolling.  There is a time 

6

limit in the statute.  But can it be tolled or not? 

7

There's no explicit command in the statute it can't. 

8
9

 And so as a matter of procedure, which 
generally we give a huge amount of deference to the 

10

agency, it has, albeit in unpublished opinions, followed 

11

a practice of considering it in motions to reopen.  And 

12

from that practice, they're telling us, there is, 

13

because the agency has determined that, with respect to 

14

IAC claims, that they will do it. 

15

 I don't actually see that much problem with 

16

the problem, but I do agree with Justice Breyer that we 

17

don't need to get to that question here, because we 

18

really don't know whether that's the view of the Fifth 

19

Circuit or not.  And if they find it or if they say it 

20

doesn't exist, I want to consider their reasons.  That's 

21

what we usually do. 

22

 But they haven't really given us reasons, 

23

other than to say the statute requires it, but I don't 

24

see why. 

25

 MR. PETERSON: 

Justice Sotomayor, with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

respect to the Fifth Circuit, I believe, I would hope, 

2

that we've supplied the reasonings  reasoning for why 

3

the Fifth Circuit's decision on equitable tolling is 

4

correct. 

5

 With respect to the agency determinations, 

6

the Board of Immigration Appeals, with rare 

7

exceptions  and there's no suggestion that this case 

8

is one  will follow the authority of the circuit in 

9

which it sits.  So you can certainly find numerous 

10

unpublished Board of Immigration Appeals decisions 

11

applying equitable tolling to the statutory deadline, 

12

but they do so primarily because they are following the 

13

circuit authority. 

14

 Now, the government agrees with us that the 

15

Board of Immigration Appeals has not independently 

16

interpreted the statute in a way that would receive 

17

Chevron deference to require equitable tolling.  So 

18

right now, I don't believe the board has taken an 

19

official position, except for in the government's brief, 

20

that equitable tolling of the statutory deadline is 

21

available. 

22
23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The odd thing with 

saying 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's  that's 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 the Fifth Circuit 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

was right in saying we  we  so  so we're going to

2

give the Petitioner another chance, we'll consider it 

3

under sua sponte.  But the board said twice that its 

4

power to reopen on its own motion is not meant as a cure 

5

for filing defects or otherwise circumvent the 

6

regulation. 

7

 So I think what they're saying is that if 

8

there's a  if there's a flaw, if the 90 days  if the 

9

90 days is  can't be stretched, then we shouldn't 

10

reach that same conclusion by saying, oh, but we can do 

11

this sua sponte. 

12

 They  they seem to be saying their 

13

exercise of their sua sponte authority is controlled by, 

14

do we have a rule that says 90 days and no more?  If we 

15

do have such a rule, we shouldn't be exercising our 

16

authority sua sponte to get around that.  And that's 

17

that's in the Petitioner Appendix at both 5 and 9, when 

18

they say we shouldn't use our power to reopen on our own 

19

motion that way, to get around what is the rule. 

20

 MR. PETERSON: 

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  We do 

21

think the Board of Immigration Appeals certainly uses 

22

its sua sponte authority to reopen sparingly and 

23

respectfully of the statutory deadlines.  As we see 

24

here, the problem is giving effect to a deadline that 

25

Congress set.  Congress certainly meant something when 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

it required these motions to reopen to be filed within

2

90 days. 

3

 And that means that the board's decision 

4

whether to reopen sua sponte, in order to exist 

5

alongside and not simply swallow that statutory 

6

deadline, needs to be in some way different in kind. 

7

And we think the way that it's different is that when 

8

the board is reopening sua sponte, when it's considering 

9

reopening on its own motion, that's a decision that is 

10

wholly in the board's discretion, and that is 

11

unreviewable in the courts under Heckler v. Chaney. 

12

 And so when an alien properly invokes the 

13

statutory authority for reopening, the ability to reopen 

14

within the 90 days that we all agree under Kucana is 

15

reviewable, it's, of course, reviewable.  When the alien 

16

misses that statutory window, when he asks the board to 

17

reopen after the 90day period is done, the board's 

18

decision whether or not to grant or to reopen is wholly 

19

in the board's discretion. 

20

 So when an alien asks the board to reopen 

21

and I think this case is the best example.  When you 

22

look at the request for reopening, you don't see, please 

23

reopen using your statutory authority.  You don't see, 

24

please reopen using your sua sponte authority to reopen. 

25

You simply see, Board of Immigration Appeals, please 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1
2

reopen my case.
 The way you determine what the true nature 

3

of the board's authority is for the decision that it's 

4

denying is whether that motion was filed within the 

5

statutory time limit or without. 

6

 So if the court of appeals looks at it and 

7

determines the alien asked for reopening after the end 

8

of the statutory deadline, the answer there is that the 

9

board's decision, its order that says, we deny 

10

reopening, is wholly within the discretion of the board 

11

and is unreviewable under Heckler v. Chaney. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So  so you  you say the 

13

Fifth Circuit did not implicitly hold that there was no 

14

review of  of the statutory deadline period 

15

 MR. PETERSON: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

As we understand 
 because you think the 

17

Fifth Circuit read the  the board's decision, since it 

18

came after the 90 days, to be a sua sponte decision and, 

19

hence, nonreviewable. 

20

 But that's not consistent with their earlier 

21

decisions, which said, we're going to interpret it this 

22

way because we have no jurisdiction to do it if you 

23

interpret it the other way. 

24

 I mean, they didn't say that, if it's after 

25

the 90 days, the  the board should consider it to be 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

an appeal to its sua sponte authority.  They said, since

2

we believe that  that there is  that there is no 

3

extension of the 90day period under the statute, in 

4

order to help the Petitioner, we're going to interpret 

5

it as a request for review of the sua sponte authority. 

6

 Isn't that  isn't that what they said. 

7

 MR. PETERSON: 

Yes, Your Honor, but we see 

8

the two as essentially indistinguishable.  Because the 

9

Petitioner's request came after the expiration of the 

10

90day period, it could have been granted only through 

11

the board's exercise of its sua sponte authority.  And a 

12

decision whether to grant or deny the board's exercise 

13

of its sua sponte, in our view, is unreviewable. 

14

 Let me point out one possible concern in 

15

writing an opinion here.  And that's the habeas context. 

16

As the Court's aware, prisoners can be quite creative in 

17

attempting to circumvent the bar on second or successive 

18

petitions under 2254 and 2255 and will frequently file 

19

motions captioned under 2241 or possibly obscure common 

20

law writs, seeking relief that's properly available 

21

under 2254 or 2255. 

22

 In those circumstances, the district courts 

23

will properly look at the merits of petitioner's 

24

request, determine that it is a request that could truly 

25

be granted only under 2254, 2255, and whatever the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

caption the prisoner has placed on it will enforce

2

AEDPA's jurisdictional bar. 

3

 And finally, with respect to merits of 

4

equitable tolling, we would simply note that, in our 

5

view, Justice Ginsburg, I believe the Fifth Circuit has 

6

already determined that Petitioner's motion to reopen 

7

was untimely.  And in the event that the Court remands 

8

to the Fifth Circuit without addressing anything other 

9

than the jurisdictional question, the inevitable result 

10

in the Fifth Circuit would simply be to deny on the 

11

merits, which is a result that would not lead to any 

12

greater benefit for Petitioner. 

13

 If there are no further questions.

remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

19

 MR. FLEMING: 

20

 I  I would simply clarify the  the issue 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

21

raised, I think, first by Justice Kagan, but then by 

22

others, as to whether there was any confusion in either 

23

the board or the Fifth Circuit as to what relief my 

24

client was seeking. 

25

 In the board decision, on page 7 of the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

Petition Appendix, the board makes clear that it

2

understands that Mr. Mata was seeking tolling.  It says, 

3

in bringing this untimely motion to reopen, the 

4

Respondent claims ineffective assistance of counsel, and 

5

then a description of matter of Lozada.  And then the 

6

board says, and the time for filing a motion to reopen 

7

may be tolled.  In cases of ineffective 

8

ineffectiveness of counsel, the alien must show that he 

9

was prejudiced by counsel's performance.  And then the 

10
11

analysis of this particular case continues. 
 And in the Fifth Circuit, the panel opinion 

12

says, when it is summarizing the decision or the 

13

proceedings below  and this is on page 2 of the 

14

Petition Appendix  Mata subsequently filed an untimely 

15

motion to reopen his removal proceedings based on a 

16

claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and asking 

17

the BIA to equitably toll the applicable finding 

18

filing period, or exercise its authority to reopen his 

19

proceedings sua sponte. 

20

 The Fifth Circuit knew exactly what was 

21

going on.  There was a request for statutory tolling or 

22

sua sponte reopening. 

23

 So I don't mean to be ungenerous to this 

24

circuit at all.  I think they got this exactly right. 

25

They understood the nature of the relief requested. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

Where they went wrong is they believed they lacked

2

jurisdiction over the first request, and that everything 

3

had to fall into the second request, where they believe 

4

they also lacked jurisdiction.  And so they dismissed 

5

the entire petition.  That error 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

7

 MR. FLEMING: 

8
9

Do you 
 is the one that should 

be 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 do you disagree with 

10

Mr. Peterson that if we were simply to say, Fifth 

11

Circuit, you have jurisdiction to decide this issue of 

12

equitable tolling, that then the  from what they've 

13

done so far, the likelihood is they'll say, fine, we 

14

have jurisdiction, there is no equitable tolling? 

15

 MR. FLEMING: 

I do disagree because I don't 

16

think that's a foregone conclusion.  I think there is 

17

every likelihood that the Fifth Circuit, once freed from 

18

its erroneous view that it is bound by panel precedent 

19

or by some other principle to not exercise appellate 

20

jurisdiction, will then look at the reasoning that other 

21

courts of appeals, every other court of appeals to have 

22

addressed this, have applied, and conclude that there 

23

is, in fact, equitable tolling. 

24
25

 Will they review Mr. Mata's appeal on the 
merits and necessarily rule in his favor?  I think they 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

should and those are the arguments we will press on the

2

merits. 

3

 But I don't think that it's our burden to 

4

show ultimate victory on every issue in order to show 

5

that the Fifth Circuit misconstrued its jurisdiction. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What  what of the 

7

argument that  that the presumption of equitable 

8

tolling applies to statutes of limitations, but not for 

9

procedural time limits like this? 

10

 MR. FLEMING: 

Our  our position, Justice 

11

Ginsburg, as laid out in our reply brief, is that this 

12

is a statute of limitations.  It serves the policies 

13

that this Court recognized in Young that are advanced by 

14

a statute of limitations, namely, the advancing of 

15

repose.  It will ensure in most cases that after 90 

16

days, the BIA's order of removal will be final, and it 

17

does also encourage the bringing of timely  a prompt 

18

motion to reopen claims, so that they are not lagging on 

19

for a long time.  And that was Congress's intent. 

20

 None of that is inconsistent with tolling. 

21

This Court has said repeatedly in cases like Bowen and 

22

Holland that when you have a situation like extreme 

23

misconduct by counsel, where there is a  an 

24

extraordinary hurdle that diligence will not get you 

25

over, it is consistent with the principle of  of
