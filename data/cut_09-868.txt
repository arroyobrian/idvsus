CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 09-868, Wall v. Kholi.

5

Mr. Weisman.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON L. WEISMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. WEISMAN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The issue before the Court today is whether

11

a State court sentence reduction motion which is a pure

12

plea for leniency qualifies as, quote, "an application

13

for post-conviction or other collateral review" within

14

the meaning of 28 U.S.C. section 2244(d)(2).

15

respectfully argued there are at least three reasons why

16

such a term as "collateral review" refers only to a

17

legal challenge, refers to those recognized post-direct

18

appeal applications in which constitutional,

19

jurisdictional, and other such fundamental errors may be

20

raised.

21

The State

First, as this Court has said, it is

22

presumed -- Congress is presumed to have known the

23

language that this Court used in its decisions, and the

24

term "collateral review" has been used by this Court,

25

certainly when referring to Federal 2255 applications,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Weisman, the

4

phrase is "post-conviction or other" -- "or other

5

collateral review."

motion is postconviction.

And certainly the Rule 25 -- 35

So it's postconviction.
review.

It's not direct

Why isn't that responsive?
MR. WEISMAN:

Well, I think both parties are

10

in agreement, Your Honor, that the postconviction review

11

is a part and parcel of the other collateral review.

12

That's not -­

13
14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

"Or" usually means it's

something in addition.
MR. WEISMAN:

Yes, but it's -- with respect,

16

Your Honor, it is "or other collateral review," and the

17

"or other" -- and I think both parties are in agreement

18

as to this -- "or other" embraces that State

19

postconviction review must also be, quote/unquote,

20

"collateral review."

21

Also, I think importantly, it would be

22

anomalous in a tolling provision, in which we are

23

talking about the direct appeal already having been

24

concluded, to embrace things that don't -- that don't -­

25

that come prior to the direct appeal.
Alderson Reporting Company

This is a tolling

2

State court judgment of conviction.

3

obviously -­

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

At that point,

Can you go back to the -­

5

you said -- you said "prior to."

I thought the Rule 35

6

motion is made after the conviction.

7

MR. WEISMAN:

Well, it can be made -- it can

8

be made prior to when the conviction becomes final.

9

example, it can be made within 120 days of the

10

imposition of sentence.

11

120 days after the affirmance of the conviction on

12

direct appeal of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

13

can be made prior to when the conviction becomes,

14

quote/unquote, "final."

15

Or it can be made within

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So it

But isn't that true

16

regardless of whether the Rule 35 motion seeks legal

17

relief or discretionary relief alone?

18

made prior to the finality of the judgment?

19

MR. WEISMAN:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That both can be

That is true, Your Honor.
And -- and if I understand

21

your argument, your argument is that Rule 35 motions

22

that seek legal review do fall within the 2244(d)(2)

23

language.

24

discretionary relief do not.

25

For

It's just that Rule 35 motions that seek

MR. WEISMAN:

Well, I'm not sure we conceded

that point, Your Honor.

2

agreement that postconviction vehicles and habeas

3

vehicles, which obviously all traditionally occur after

4

the direct appeal has been concluded, obviously qualify

5

as what this Court -- and everybody, we would suggest -­

6

recognizes as, quote/unquote, "collateral review."

7

I think clearly we're all in

In terms of a Rule 35 motion that says, for

8

example, the sentence is outside of the -- outside of

9

the proper boundaries, it's unlawful as a matter of law,

10

I don't think we've actually conceded before this Court

11

that that would qualify.

12

But certainly this Court -­

of a judgment that has already survived scrutiny under

2

direct review.

3

raises a legal challenge -- and a tolling provision

4

simply would not begin to run at that point.

5

And a Rule 35 vehicle, even one that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -- I don't

6

understand your argument at all.

It seems to me the

7

phrase "post-conviction or other collateral review"

8

means postconviction collateral review or preconviction

9

collateral review.

Isn't that what is added?

10

"Post-conviction or other"; what's "other" from

11

"post-conviction"?

12

wouldn't it?

13

I guess it would be preconviction,

MR. WEISMAN:

Well, we would suggest, Your

14

Honor, that the "collateral review," as explained by

15

this Court, is referring to the difference between

16

collateral review and direct review.

17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the case in -­

That's fine.

And is this

direct review?

19

MR. WEISMAN:

This would not -- this is

20

clearly not -- this is not in the direct review process.

21

No, it's not.

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's collateral review?

So -­

24

MR. WEISMAN:

Well -­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you lose.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WEISMAN:

This -- this Court, though,

2

Your Honor, has said that, speaking about when Congress

3

enacted 2255, it simplified the procedure for making a

4

collateral attack on a final judgment entered in a

5

Federal criminal case, but it did not purport to modify

6

the distinction, again, between collateral review and

7

direct review.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would think that if -- if

there's anything to the point you're making, it -- it

10

hinges not on the "post-conviction or other collateral"

11

phrase, but rather on the word "review."

12

I suppose it could be argued that you're not

13

reviewing the judgment if you're asking for mercy.

14

Whether a judgment was good or bad, you're -- you're

15

asking for mercy.

16

not review.

17

And I would -- you know, perhaps it's

Is that your point?
MR. WEISMAN:

Well, we go forward and use

18

that -- even -- we would suggest, Your Honor, even more

19

strongly that the phrase "collateral review," as that

20

phrase has been used by this Court consistently,

21

recognizes that this is a procedure that occurs after

22

the completion of a direct review process.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's only because

24

all the cases we've had involved that.

25

a case like this before.

We've never had

So in all those other cases,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

we've used the natural term "collateral review."

2

doesn't mean it couldn't apply to this.

3

we've never had occasion to inquire whether it applies

4

to this.

5

MR. WEISMAN:

That

It just means

But, Your Honor, respectfully,

6

in State v. Addonizio itself, it contrasted the Rule 35

8

obviously the Federal courts, had this very -- almost

exact Rule 35-type proceeding.

Many jurisdictions, including

11

of cases, as collateral review.

understood as a -- sort of a quasi-civil inquiry, after

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It always had been

Mr. Weisman, I think that

15

that's not right, that the -- as you say, that the

16

Rule 35 motion that Rhode Island has is based on the

17

Federal Rule 35 motion that existed prior to 1987, and

18

that on a couple of occasions this Court talked about

19

that prior Federal Rule 35 as collateral review.

20

wrong about that?

MR. WEISMAN:

Am I

We don't believe so, Your

Honor.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. WEISMAN:

We don't believe it ever

MR. WEISMAN:

And the current Federal

Yes.
-- provides for -- it's

Rule 35 also, but it doesn't have the pure leniency?
That's Rhode Island's?

11

MR. WEISMAN:

That's correct -- correct,

12

Your Honor.

13

guidelines rule, which is the same.

14

We're just speaking about the pre-1987

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let's assume that we adopt

15

your formulation generally, that it has to be for legal

16

error, collateral review has to be for legal error, and

17

we could even add what the Ninth Circuit has found, it

18

has to be by a court in order to avoid clemency, parole

19

review boards, and so forth.

20

I don't see why you don't lose anyway,

21

because the allegation here, the complaint, the

22

argument, may be that there was an abuse of discretion,

23

and if there's an abuse of discretion, that is a legal

24

ground to set aside the -- the sentence.

25

MR. WEISMAN:

I think, Your Honor, we have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

to differentiate between a legal ground and the vehicle.

2

Again, the vehicle, the reduction, the plea for leniency

3

vehicle, is not a legal vehicle.

4

as the Kholi panel recognized -­

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's simply, I think,

Well, it's a motion made

6

in a court, reviewable by the appellate courts of the

State.

MR. WEISMAN:

Well, it -- but -- but -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's a little odd to say

that that's not legal.

standard is something we're quite familiar with in the

law.

13

extra-legal.

14

If -- an abuse of discretion

We've never thought of that as being somehow

MR. WEISMAN:

Well, to the extent it's abuse

15

of discretion, it's really shorthand for the appellate

16

17

bounds and if there was, quote, "some justification" for

the imposition of the sentence, then it's affirmed.

justification, what do they do?
MR. WEISMAN:

If there's no justification --

I mean, I can say it hasn't happened so far in our

24

State, and I think -- you know, I don't know what

25

happens in other States, but, essentially, that's all
Alderson Reporting Company

the inquiry is.

2

it's in the legal bounds, the filing of the motion

3

itself, as to pre-'87 guidelines, presumes the validity

4

of the conviction and sentence, and it simply says:

5

Give me a second chance; take a second look; look at the

6

offender, look at the characteristics, look at what -­

They take a look at the sentence; if

than the characteristics that the sentencing judge looks

at in the first instance?

MR. WEISMAN:
could be other.

They could be the same.

They

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, how

13

these -- you've obviously seen a lot of these, and I

14

haven't seen any, but I mean, do the Rule 35 motions

15

typically say -- do they typically concede the legal

16

validity of the sentence and then simply say -- what?

17

mean, I assume the sentencing is -- is completely open

18

and you can put in anything at all, like the -- the

19

deprived childhood, the unique situation, the age,

20

whatever.

21

MR. WEISMAN:

Correct.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In what sense is

23

Rule 35 different from the arguments that are made at

sentencing?

25

MR. WEISMAN:

It's not much different at

it is simply -­

It is essentially the same.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is -­

But that's bad for

4

you, isn't it, I mean for the very point that Justice

5

Kennedy was raising?

6

that you get to raise as a legal matter prior to the

7

imposition of sentencing, why should they not be

8

considered legal matters when they're raised under Rule

9

35?

10

If it's the same sort of arguments

MR. WEISMAN:

Because we don't believe they

11

are legal matters, Your Honor.

12

is sentence leniency based on pure factual matters like,

13

as you indicated, Your Honor, Chief Justice, the history

of the individual, the various -­

What they're asking for

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are those issues

16

that can be -- that are typically raised on direct -­

18

MR. WEISMAN:

No, they're not, Your Honor.

20

and sentencing issues must be raised pursuant to

Rule 35.

If I could -­

11

MR. WEISMAN:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So please explain to me

13

why that is not what Justice Kennedy described as a

14

review for abuse of discretion and why a review for

15

abuse of discretion is not a legal challenge?

16

MR. WEISMAN:

Well, what we suggest is the

17

abuse of discretion that that is talking about is if

18

there's no justification.

19

at the sentence, and if there's no justification for it,

20

then it will be an abuse of discretion.

21

justification -- and, again, it hasn't happened.

22

there's some -- if the sentence is within the legal

23

limits and there's some justification for it, it will be

affirmed.

2

MR. WEISMAN:

That's the shorthand.

4

Rhode Island appellate courts never change a sentence

5

under Rule 35?

6

MR. WEISMAN:

We have not -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or are you saying that

8

they do find some lack of justification in some

9

sentences?

10

MR. WEISMAN:

No.

What we're -- what we're

11

saying, Your Honor, is if there's some justification for

12

it and if it's within the legal sentencing bounds, the

13

denial of the Rule 35 motion is affirmed.

14

happens all the time.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that

Well, then -- then think

16

you're saying that it only gets reversed for abuse of

17

discretion, right?

18

MR. WEISMAN:

Well, Your Honor -­

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's a legal ground,

20

it seems to me.

21

that's a plea for leniency.

22

the sentencing court abused its discretion and should

23

have given a lesser sentence.

24

It's abuse of discretion.

25

And I don't know how you could say that

MR. WEISMAN:

It's a plea that -- that

How is that leniency?

Because the inquiry is simply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

-- I understand the words "abuse of discretion" are

2

used, but the "no justification and manifestly excessive

3

standard" simply, as the cases explicate, looks at the

4

sentence; if it's legal and if there's some

5

justification for it, the appeal is denied.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't want to have to

7

figure this out case by case, or even jurisdiction by

8

jurisdiction, as to whether it's an abuse of discretion

9

review or a leniency review or this or that.

And

10

that -- that makes me inclined to say we should treat

11

your Rule 35 as coming within the tolling provision, so

12

we don't have to grapple with -- I mean, I'm not having

13

very much success understanding the distinction that

14

you're telling me.

15

50 States.

16

I don't want to have to do this for

MR. WEISMAN:

I understand.

But certainly,

17

Your Honor, just -- just using the formulation that

18

everything that's filed in a State court post a judgment

19

of conviction qualifies would certainly be an odd way

20

for that Congress to have expressed that.

21

MR. WEISMAN:

We're talking -- this case

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Weisman, I'm sorry.

17

Before you talk about policy, so this motion to reduce

above matter be reduced in accordance with the

provisions of Rule 35."

22

you if it said he prays that the sentence imposed -- he

23

prays that the illegal sentence imposed with respect to

24

the above matter be reduced in accordance with

25

provisions of Rule 35?

It just says that the man

Would it make a difference to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

MR. WEISMAN:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

It might be.
If he had put in that word,

"illegal," would that have made the difference?

4

MR. WEISMAN:

It might, Your Honor.

And

5

under our system, it might -- that might have been

6

characterized, not as a sentence reduction provision or

7

sentence reduction vehicle, but as a legal motion to

8

correct an illegal sentence, or challenging the

9

sentence.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- but that does suggest

11

the difficulty that Justice Scalia raises, is that we're

12

going to have to look at the particular rule of the

13

State, we're going to have to look at the particular

14

motion, we're going to look at any -- we're going to

15

have to look at any State law regarding how motions are

16

construed.

17

MR. WEISMAN:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19
20

Sure.
And this is going to be a

very difficult determination.
MR. WEISMAN:

Sure.

If I could just address

21

that, Your Honor.

The problem is -- it's simply because

22

a statute of limitations is an affirmative defense,

23

these are matters that already are going to have been

24

concluded in the State court.

25

2254, the State's court's going to have findings.

Before anyone files for

They're going to -- it's either going to be a motion for

sentence leniency or it's going to be a motion to

correct an illegal sentence.

4

These matters -- and they have to be pled by

5

the State as well.

So when an applicant goes to Federal

6

court, district court, and files a 2254, if we want to

will save the Federal court a lot of time, obviously,

9

because there is no case at all -- and if we can

10

contrast it with exhaustion, for example, which, as this

11

Court obviously is familiar with, presents very

12

complicated questions of whether, you know, State

13

procedures were exhausted and claims were exhausted,

14

this is very straightforward.

15

motion which challenges the legality of the sentence, it

16

will be characterized in State court in the run of the

17

mine -- in the run of the mine cases, as an

18

illegal sentence.

19

If somebody raises a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So a petitioner in the

20

future in Rhode Island should file a petition that says:

21

I'm filing a motion pursuant to 35(a) for an illegal

22

sentence -- make something up -­

23

MR. WEISMAN:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Right.
-- or for leniency.

And

then are district courts supposed to figure out whether
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

the legal challenge was frivolous or not or had a basis

2

in law or fact -­

3

MR. WEISMAN:

Well -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and then decide

5

whether they would toll or not toll based on that now

6

side trial on what's an illegal sentence and what's just

7

a plea for leniency?

That's what you are proposing?

8

MR. WEISMAN:

Well, what we suggest actually

9

is very straightforward, Your Honor.

If somebody

10

captions their document, you know, "Motion for sentence"

11

-- "for sentence reduction and motion to correct an

12

illegal sentence," that's not this case, obviously,

13

because then the court -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what if they say

15

"correct the illegal sentence because it was an abuse of

16

discretion"?

17

MR. WEISMAN:

If it's -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So is the magic words

19

"illegal sentence" or is the magic words "abuse of" -­

20

what are the magic words?

21

MR. WEISMAN:

Well, it may not so much be

22

magic words, but it's what the -- as this Court has

23

said, it's what the substance of the motion seeks, and

24

that will already have been determined in State court.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Either -- either your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

victory will give you absolutely nothing, or you have

2

truly stupid defendant lawyers in Rhode Island.

3

why would anybody not caption the 35 motion that way?

4

MR. WEISMAN:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean,

Because -­
What's to lose?

You say it

6

doesn't matter if your claim of an illegal sentence is

7

frivolous or not.

8
9

What's to lose?

MR. WEISMAN:

Because, Your Honor, they

actually want to reduce their sentence.

It's not -- we

10

don't suggest it's not a matter of playing games.

11

-- you know, they feel they were sentenced for 30 years

12

and maybe they want 20 years, and if they want to

13

challenge the legality of the sentence, they recognize

14

the established collateral attack vehicles.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

There is another argument

16

that you could make, other than the one you've been

17

pressing, which is that collateral review means

18

something other than a step in the criminal case.

19

you've chosen not to make that; is that correct?

20

MR. WEISMAN:

They

But

Well, we've spoken about the

21

words "collateral review" as embracing a case that's

22

already -- upon looking -- a proceeding that occurs

23

after the finality of the judgment, which obviously

24

includes this Court's denial of cert or the time -­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you've said that this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

could be done before finality.

2

MR. WEISMAN:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought -- I -­

No.
I'm sure you said that

4

earlier, that this motion can be made before the

5

judgment is final.

6
7

MR. WEISMAN:
Your Honor.

8
9

Didn't you say that?
It can.

And we would suggest -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's not what you

just said.

10

MR. WEISMAN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

It certainly can,

the finality.

13

No -­
What you just said is after

Which is it?

MR. WEISMAN:

We would suggest, Your Honor,

14

that that furthers our argument.

A Rule 35 motion is

15

not collateral review because it is not a motion -- you

16

could say even in a legal sense, motion.

17

motion that occurs after the judgment becomes final.

18

And we're looking at a tolling provision, and the

19

congressional intent of the tolling provision was

20

finality and exhaustion of State remedies.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

It's not a

I'm not sure

22

I understand that.

23

bars a litigant from filing after the conviction is

24

final.

25

There's nothing in this rule that

They have 120 days.
MR. WEISMAN:

They have 120 days.

Alderson Reporting Company

It can be

Official - Subject to Final Review

24
1

filed after the sentence is imposed, 120 days of that

2

date, or 120 days after the conviction becomes final.

3

And we would suggest that the term "collateral review"

4

embraces, as Justice Alito indicated, sort of that

5

concept that, obviously in a tolling provision, it

6

begins to run when the conviction becomes final.

7
8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Justice Scalia's

suggestion -­

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Except that it says -­
-- that perhaps the -­

11

the leniency review is -- is not review of the

12

conviction or sentence.

13

anything with that.

14

review that's involved with leniency is really not

15

review of the sentence for legal error.

16

But you didn't -- you didn't do

You didn't argue that the kind of

MR. WEISMAN:

It's clearly not, Your Honor,

17

correct.

18

Kholi panel and the Respondents in this case as well

19

characterized this Rule 35 proceeding as sort of apart,

20

distinct, away from the underlying case.

21

undoubtedly true in the sense that it's not -- it's not

22

part of the direct review process.

23

not.

24

It's not either/or.

25

I think, as everybody here recognizes, the

And that's

It's -- it's clearly

But that doesn't mean it's collateral review.
It could be -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what -- is it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

something in between?

2

collateral?

3

It's not direct and it's not

MR. WEISMAN:

It's -- it's neither fish nor

4

fowl, Your Honor.

I mean, simply because it's not part

5

of a direct review process doesn't mean that it's,

6

quote, our argument would be, "collateral review,"

7

because, again, "collateral review" has this sort of

8

meaning in the law, using this Court's decisions, using

9

this Court's cases, referring to a post-judgment vehicle

10

in which fundamental jurisdictional and other types of

11

errors can be raised.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

What about a motion -­

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess we need a new

14

adjective then, because I'd always thought that there

15

are two kinds of review, direct and collateral.

16

there's a -- a tertium quid.

17

call that?

18

MR. WEISMAN:

What do you want us to

Well, I don't know that it

19

needs to be called anything, Your Honor.

20

only question with respect -­

21

You say

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think the

I think that maybe it

22

doesn't need to be called anything because it doesn't

23

exist.

I -- I can't -­

24

MR. WEISMAN:

Well -­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- imagine anything that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

isn't either direct or collateral.

2

MR. WEISMAN:

-- it is certainly -- it is

3

certainly an interesting vehicle because, it can be

4

filed prior to the finality of the judgment and it can

5

be filed -- and it can be filed after the judgment

6

becomes final.

7

And, again, going -- going back to the

8

policies, the 2244(d)(2), very clearly, two big

9

policies, again, are finality, which obviously it

10

promotes -- these cases would not be in Federal court if

11

they were time-barred -- and exhaustion of State

12

remedies.

13

there's no purpose that could be accomplished by

14

bringing that motion into Federal court, and therefore

15

it doesn't serve that purpose.

16

To have a motion that seeks leniency only,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Weisman, that's

17

true also of State habeas claims that are based only on

18

State law.

19

applies to those claims.

20

MR. WEISMAN:

But six circuits have said that 2244(d)(2)
Are you contesting that?
We're not.

But the -- but the

21

important element there, Your Honor, is that those

22

vehicles can be raised to bring -- those are the

23

vehicles, the collateral vehicles, through which the

24

States have channelled constitutional, jurisdictional,

25

and other fundamental claims.
Alderson Reporting Company

27

The Rule 35 sentence reduction vehicle

2

doesn't -- can't do it, can't do that service.

3

sure, you could have -- you could have a habeas, and the

4

only issue, the only claim raised in habeas could be,

5

you know, it's in violation of -- of my State rights,

which couldn't be heard in 2254, but -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

does not come into effect.

MR. WEISMAN:

So,

have well said we're not going to be in the business of

vehicle for bringing, for channeling in these claims.

14

So that's going to toll.

15

Look, this is a

This vehicle is a recognized

But this other vehicle, this Rule 35

16

sentence reduction vehicle -- it can never be used for a

17

claim that could go to Federal court.

18

I mean, it wouldn't serve the purpose, and of course it

19

would undermine the State's interest in getting the

20

State prisoners into Federal court within 1 year.

21

It's pointless.

I'll reserve my time if that's okay, Your

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH H. MIZNER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MS. MIZNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

The First Circuit here correctly held that

6

Khalil Kholi's motion for a reduction of sentence under

7

Rhode Island Rule 35 was an application for State

8

postconviction or other collateral review with respect

9

to the pertinent judgment or claim.

As such, it tolled

10

AEDPA's 1-year limitation period, and Mr. Kholi's

11

petition was timely filed.

12

We look to the common usage and ordinary

13

understanding of the words of the tolling provision in

14

the context of the statute.

15

proceeding occurring after final judgment that could

16

affect that judgment.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Collateral review is a

Am I correct that you think

18

"post-conviction or other collateral review" means

19

anything that occurs after the conclusion of direct

20

review?

21
22
23

MS. MIZNER:

Yes, for purposes of the

tolling provision.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Then what does the phrase

24

"or other collateral review" add?

25

Congress just say "post-conviction review"?
Alderson Reporting Company

Why -- why wouldn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

MS. MIZNER:

In Duncan, this Court talked

2

about the possibility of civil commitment or contempt in

3

custody that could be part of the Rule 2254 proceeding

4

and that that would not be postconviction.

5

postconviction is a form of collateral review but is not

6

the only form.

7

So that

In Duncan, the Court also discussed the fact

8

that many States may call what other States call

9

"post-conviction review" something else, and that that

10

would also then be collateral.

11

a -- an umbrella that encompasses postconviction and

12

other forms of review after a judgment.

13

The collateral is just

call your motion a motion to correct an illegal

15

sentence?

gather.

17
18
19
20

Then we wouldn't have any dispute here, I

MS. MIZNER:
would not be.

I did not file this motion.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

(Laughter.)

22

MS. MIZNER:

24
25

You're not one of

the stupid lawyers that we were worried about before.

21

23

Under the State's theory, there

I may be in other respects,

Your Honor, but not this one.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sure of that.

But you do think that if you had -- if you or whoever
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

files these motions had simply said that, there would be

2

no problem, right?

3

MS. MIZNER:

From the State's perspective.

4

I don't think that there's a problem with omitting the

5

word "illegal," because -­

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's because

7

you want something other than legal review, right?

You

8

want to throw yourself on the mercy of the court.

9

You've got plenty of avenues to correct the illegality

10

of the sentence, but this is something different, right?

11

This is to -- not correct -- you admit it's illegal, but

12

you say but it should still be reduced for a lot of

13

reasons.

14

MS. MIZNER:

Yes.

It is a request for the

15

court to -- to review, to take a second look, to

16

reexamine the sentence to determine whether or not it

17

was unduly severe at the time that it was imposed.

18

are asking the court to -- to take a second look, either

19

based on factors that were submitted at sentencing or

20

additional information that -­

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You

You can raise all of

22

those -- all of those claims under the normal State

23

collateral postconviction, State habeas, all those other

24

things, right?

25

MS. MIZNER:

You can raise those issues

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under the postconviction review.

2

them -- in Rhode Island, there is a provision of the

3

postconviction review statute that speaks of the -- any

4

facts that would require a new proceeding in the

5

interests of justice.

6

You can also raise

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I guess I'm

7

having trouble.

You can -- the various grounds on which

8

the sentence should have been lower than it was,

9

including the fact that setting the sentence at that

10

level was an abuse of discretion, you obviously can

11

raise those at sentencing and you can raise those on

12

direct review, right?

14
15

17
18

20

MS. MIZNER:

In Rhode Island, you cannot

challenge your sentence on direct review.

Rule 35 motion.

you could also encompass it in a motion for

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So after a conviction in

the State, if there's an appeal with a number -- on

7

direct review, with a number of issues, improperly

8

admitted evidence and so forth, you -- the lawyer can't

add:

10

provision; he was given 5 years too many because the

11

judge cited the wrong provision.

direct review?

13

You can't say that on

Under my understanding of the

14

Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions, the answer to that

15

is no.

16
17
18
19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You can challenge only

the conviction, not the sentence, on direct review?
MS. MIZNER:

I believe that that is the

holding of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do -­

In what -­
Do you agree that Rule 35

23

is not something that the prisoner must exhaust before

24

seeking Federal habeas?

25

MS. MIZNER:

Exhaustion for Federal habeas

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

is limited to exhaustion of the claims that are going to

2

be presented in the Federal habeas petition.

3

a -- the denial of a request for a sentence reduction on

4

the grounds of abuse of discretion is not going to be a

5

claim that is cognizable in Federal habeas corpus

6

jurisdiction, then you would not need to exhaust it.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And since

But this is the whole

8

purpose of allowing tolling of the 1-year Federal

9

statute, the purpose to give the petitioner an

10

opportunity to exhaust what he must exhaust?

11

MS. MIZNER:

Exhaustion is one of the

12

purposes of the tolling provision, but this Court has

13

recognized that AEDPA's purpose was to further the

14

principles of comity and finality and federalism, and

15

had a clear purpose of encouraging litigants to pursue

16

claims in State court prior to seeking Federal review.

17

So, tying the tolling provision to State

18

applications shows congressional concern for comity,

19

which at its core is a -- is a respect for the State

20

processes that are used in reviewing the claims of State

21

prisoners.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I may have

23

asked this already, but it seems unusual to me so I want

to make sure of the answer.

It turns out that he sentences

That, you're telling me, is a claim that you

It would be raised in the State

MS. MIZNER:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's -­

The -­
Just so your adversary,

8

when he gets up on rebuttal, can confirm or not this

9

point, any challenge to an illegal sentence has to be

10

brought first in a Rule 35(a) motion, regardless of what

11

the grounds of the illegality are?

12
13
14

MS. MIZNER:

Yes, or perhaps in a motion for

postconviction relief under section 10-9.1.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I return to the question

15

Justice Ginsburg asked a couple of minutes ago?

We have

16

-- let's say we have a case in which a defendant

17

convicted in State court has some exhausted Federal

18

claims that this defendant wants to raise in a Federal

19

habeas; also files a motion seeking a reduction of

20

sentence based purely on a request for leniency, a

21

sentence within the range prescribed by the statute.

22

What purpose is served by tolling the time to file the

23

Federal habeas during the pendency of this request for

24

leniency in the State court?

25

in concrete practical terms, what purpose is served?

Now, you say comity, but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

MS. MIZNER:

A prisoner who receives

2

adequate relief in the State court, through whatever

3

vehicle, may choose not to pursue a Federal habeas

4

corpus claim.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

In your experience, does

6

that happen a lot?

You have somebody who is sentenced

7

to a 5-year sentence and that's within the range, also

8

has legal challenges that would result in no conviction,

9

no time whatsoever and no criminal conviction -- that

10

person decides to give up on the legal challenge because

11

the 5-year sentence might be reduced to 3 or 2 or 1?

12

MS. MIZNER:

I would say that would be

13

unlikely, but there are many Federal habeas cases that

14

are -- raise questions of, for example, ineffective

15

assistance of counsel at sentencing.

16

that reduces the sentence would obviate the need for a

17

Federal habeas petition in that context.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

A State resolution

Can you explain -­
If you look at 2255 -­

20

that's the Federal postconviction review, and it also

21

has a 1-year statute of limitations.

22

would not be tolled for a Federal Rule 35 motion.

23

why should it be tolled for State?

24
25

MS. MIZNER:

That limitation
So

2255, Justice Ginsburg, has no

tolling provision at all, and the reason for that may
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

37
1

perhaps be the respect for comity that Congress

2

recognized when you are addressing a 2254 petition filed

3

by a State prisoner.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think, Ms. Mizner, the

5

amicus brief in this case asserted that, in Rhode Island

6

or in other States with a rule like this, many judges

7

sit on these Rule 35 motions.

8

pending for a considerable period of time, in order to

9

retain some ability to modify the sentence if and when

They just let them stay

10

they feel like doing so.

11

what happens to these motions, that they just sit, that

12

they are not denied?

13

MS. MIZNER:

Is that your understanding of

I don't practice in Rhode

14

Island, but in this case the Rule 35 did not sit.

15

was resolved by the trial court within 3 months.

16

issue, the potential for abuse from sitting on motions

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Alderson Reporting Company

The 2255, which

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WEISMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

I'll begin -- if I could just clarify

10

regarding the scope of Rule 35.

11

Rule 35 do make it very clear that an illegal sentence

12

is one which has been imposed after a valid conviction

13

but is not authorized under law.

14

sentence in excess of that provided by statute,

15

imposition of an unauthorized form of punishment, a

16

judgment that does not conform to the oral sentence.

17

And our supreme court has gone on to explain this

18

provision by saying:

19

countenanced a challenge to the constitutionality of a

20

penal statute in the context of a Rule 35 motion, nor

21

have we declared that a sentence imposed pursuant to an

22

unconstitutional statute is illegal as contemplated by

23

Rule 35.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Perhaps we can go back

to the simple question, which is, can a defendant who

4

has been sentenced bring a challenge to a sentence in a

5

direct appeal or not?

6

35(a)?

7

Or do they have to go by Rule

MR. WEISMAN:

Although there is dicta and

8

some language where our supreme court says essentially

9

file challenges to your sentences pursuant to Rule 35,

10

it is clear that only certain types of challenges can be

11

brought in a Rule 35 motion.

12

cases, they have to be brought if there is an appellate

13

record in direct appeal, or most commonly they're

14

brought pursuant to the State's postconviction relief.

15

In the run of the mill

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So now we

16

get to the point where some can go under 35(a) but some

17

can't.

18

MR. WEISMAN:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

Right.
So they should go on

direct appeal, correct?
MR. WEISMAN:

The only ones that are correct

22

under 35(a) are, again, where the sentence is not

23

authorized by law or has imposed an unauthorized form of

24

punishment or a judgment that -­

I look at the language of the

in the lower court, but they say when the sentence is

final at the conclusion of direct review in respect to

Yes, but our point would be,

MR. WEISMAN:

No.

What we -- respectfully,

what we're going to say is collateral review refers to

those, as this Court said in Duncan v. Walker, habeas

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm totally confused.

20

If this is part of the criminal proceeding, which is

your position, that it's not collateral, but it's part

of the proceedings, when does this proceeding become

MR. WEISMAN:

it becomes final when -- 90 days from when the supreme

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But if the Rhode Island

court has told litigants that they can't challenge some

portions of an illegal sentence except by way of Rule

35, how can we call the decision on the affirmance of

the conviction a final determination of the legality of

10

the sentence?

11

That's contradictory.

MR. WEISMAN:
