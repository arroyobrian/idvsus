Initiative 872 is unconstitutional, holding that

allowing each candidate to state his or her personal

party preference on the ballot would create the

24

appearance of association between a political party and

candidate.

First, the Ninth Circuit's appearance-

They will not.

The top-two ballot -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can you give us

7

assurance that they will not?

16

declaration of candidacy form, which the secretary of

17

state did have the opportunity to promulgate, which

18

appears in the corrected joint appendix at pages

19

592-593.

20

Justice, is that, unlike the old declaration of

21

candidacy form, we have the candidates declaring

22

themselves as a candidate for the office of blank, and

23

instead of saying that they're a candidate of a party,

24

they say -- that you have an opportunity to check off

25

the box that my party preference is blank or I'm -- I am

And what we see there, Your Honor, Mr. Chief

an independent candidate; or, under Initiative 872, if

2

they check neither box, that will be left blank on the

3

ballot.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you say that the purpose

5

of allowing a candidate to declare a preference is

6

simply to convey useful information to voters, but once

7

you decided, once the State decided, that the ballot was

8

not going to indicate party affiliation, why do you

9

limit candidates to the names of parties?

Why don't you

10

allow them to pick some other phrase that better

11

expresses their point of view?

12

say, I'm the pro-environment candidate, or I'm the

13

no-new-taxes candidate.

14

Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, et cetera?

15

Somebody may want to

Why do you limit them to saying

Your Honor, the voters could

16

have chosen to allow candidates to include other

17

information.

19

whatever expression they wished.

20

to allow an expression of party preference, which the

21

State is allowed to do.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

example that might help illustrate our point.

Imagine

5

that Mr. Dale from the Boy Scouts v. Dale case moved to

6

Washington State and wanted to run for office, and

7

imagine that, instead of saying party preference, the

8

voters had said, well, you can choose to list any

9

organization for which you have a preference, a

10

political organization or another; and that Mr. Dale

11

decided to express a preference for the Boy Scouts.

12

Mr. Dale would be exercising his own speech, but that

13

would not be the same thing as compelling speech by the

14

Boy Scouts.

15

Nor would he be compelling CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Nobody is voting for

Do you agree that if

it were that way, in other words if the ballot looked

5

that that would be unconstitutional?

6

MR. McKENNA:

Yes, Your Honor, it would be

7

harder to argue from our side.

But Your Honor, the

8

Ninth Circuit only assumed that the ballot would look

9

like the ballot on page 1 of the Grange yellow brief.

10

They assumed that the ballot would look exactly like the

statements continue under the general election?

I was about to say, there is a very important practical

reason to require candidates to decide what their

Alderson Reporting Company

You did say

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, and on what basis are you predicting that the

2

statement of preference will not be confused with a

3

statement of endorsement?

4

MR. McKENNA:

On two bases, Justice

5

Ginsburg.

6

the sample ballots from the Grange brief, the State will

7

be extremely explicit in stating that the candidate's

8

claim of preference or statement of preference is not

9

the party's statement that the candidate is a member,

10

The first basis is that, as we've shown with

endorsee, nominee, or what have you.

11

The second basis is I think just the general

12

basis this Court has recognized in Tasjian and in

13

Anderson v. Cellebreze, where the Court expressed a

14

greater faith in the ability of individual voters to

15

inform themselves beyond just the balance.

16

many other sources of information.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are so

I don't think it's enough

18

that -- that there's no claim of party endorsement.

19

There is a claim of associating himself with the party,

20

and if he associates himself with the party it seems to

21

me the party should be able to disassociate itself from

22

him.

23

And I think it harms the party not to permit that.
MR. McKENNA:

No, Justice Scalia, I

24

respectfully disagree.

This is not an association in

25

the constitutional sense.

It is merely an expression of
19

Alderson Reporting Company

1

preference, which we -- which Initiative 872 in its open

2

language and which the ballot will carefully distinguish

3

from claiming a formal association.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

who go around saying I prefer the Democratic Party who

do not regard themselves and register themselves as

that -- I don't know whether this is fatal to your case,

9

but in the real world, it seems to me the distinction

I mean, in the real world I don't know

10

you're drawing is simply not drawn.

11

MR. McKENNA:

Your Honor, I think it's

12

helpful to think of the expression of party preference

13

as a subset of party affiliation.

14

someone might be a party affiliate -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In other words,

It's helpful to your case,

16

but, going back to my question, do you know any people

the Democrats; I'm a Republican myself?

19

20

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. WHITE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Candidates are the party's messengers to win

7

over the public on the important issues of the day.

8

Initiative 872 converts the established right of

9

political parties to select their messengers into a mere

10
11

right to endorse.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you -- what do you

12

say about the fact that you have a right to select and

13

designate an official candidate and it's independent of

14

this ballot procedures?

15

MR. WHITE:

As the secretary of state

16

pointed out -- and this is at JA-363 -- the secretary of

17

state indicated the State would pay no attention to the

18

party's nominating conventions and instead would

19

continue to allow candidates to use party labels just as

20

they had in the primary before.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

If the rationale in

22

Jones was that the defect was that the association,

23

political association, was being adulterated by the

24

method of, of the use of ballots, to select what was an

official nominee, that problem does not exist here.

MR. WHITE:

It does, it does, Your Honor.

2

And it does in the manner that this -- the candidates

3

who were selected at the Initiative 872, the modified

4

blanket primary, are going to be carrying the party's

5

standard in the general election.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You're saying in practical

separate official nomination that nobody pays attention

4

nothing indicating an official nomination on the ballot

itself.

6

through a convention, or whatever other scheme they can

come up with, can -- can designate an official nominee

But as I -- I am also assuming that the parties

And if they do so

The person in campaigning can say, I am the official

11

nominee of the X party.

12

aren't they?

13

MR. WHITE:

And those facts are true,

They are, Your Honor, but that

14

converts the right to nominate to a mere right to

15

endorse, and this Court has recognized that the ability

16

to endorse a candidate is no substitute -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You're saying that a right

18

to nominate has to be a right to exclude everyone from

19

the ballot except the nominee -- everyone from the

20

ballot under that banner, from the nominee.

21
22

MR. WHITE:

To be -- to be a meaningful

right to nominate, yes, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It -

Where does that right

24

come from?

I thought in Jones, the Court had said if

25

you had just a blanket primary, with no indication of
30
Alderson Reporting Company

2

And if that's so, then parties don't have any right to

3

have a candidate.

4

MR. WHITE:

I'm not suggesting that the

5

parties have a constitutional right to place their party

6

name on a truly nonpartisan ballot, and I think what the

7

primary where there are no party identifications.

That it's just say a statement

The notion

that disclaimers are necessary, and the State indicates

question of what legitimate State interest is being

4

nominee.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if it's the masking

6

that's the problem, the -- the nominee is going to be

7

just as well masked on the ballot or better masked on

8

the ballot that allows no statement of preference at

9

all.

10

MR. WHITE:

No, Justice -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -- and I'm not saying

12

that that's fatally your case, but I mean it's -- it's

13

something we need to be careful about when we're doing

14

our thinking, and that's why I'm pressing you on it.

15

MR. WHITE:

Well -- and I think it's -- it's

16

the masking in the context of a partisan system.

17

State may elect to have nonpartisan offices, and many

18

local offices throughout the West are nonpartisan.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

But if -- but if it's just

20

masking in a partisan system, then it seems to me you're

21

making the same argument that you make when you say, by

22

allowing statements of preference, we obscure the

23

character of the official nominee and in effect allow

24

somebody to have a -- a second shot at -- at getting

25

Republican support as a Republican.

1

It seems to me that if it's masking in a

2

partisan ballot that's the real problem, there's only

3

one objection and the objection is not so much the

4

masking as it is the submergence of the official

5

nomination by allowing competition under the party's

6

name by another candidate.

7

MR. WHITE:

Isn't that fair to say?

I -- I think, Justice Souter,

8

that it -- that it is two separate inquiries.

First you

9

have the difficulty that as a practical matter these

10

candidates will be identified as Republican nominees or

11

Republican candidates, but even if the State were able

12

to posit sufficient disclaimers and caveats, that the

13

State has shown no valid interest in allowing a

14

candidate to use the name -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask this question:

This is a facial challenge, is it not?

4

MR. WHITE:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what exactly -- what

6

relief did the district court grant?

7

entire blanket primary or just the designation of

8

parties?

9

MR. WHITE:

Did he enjoin the

The district court enjoined the

10

entirety of Initiative 872 because it determined that

11

the party preference provisions of Initiative 872 were

12

not severable under Washington State's test for

13

severability.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think that was the

15

narrowest relief he could have granted to avoid the

16

constitutional difficulty that you see?

17

MR. WHITE:

I -- I think that was the -- I

18

think that was the appropriate, and it is a narrow

19

relief.

initiative, the connection of the party preference, and

21

the party preference provisions permeate Initiative 872,

22

and determined that severability was not appropriate.

23

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

The court looked at the structure of the

administerable if it was severed, if the preference

provision was just deleted?

2

MR. WHITE:

I'm not -- I'm not sure that it

3

would, Your Honor.

I'm not sure that it would because

4

-- and what the State and the Grange argued below is

5

that -- they actually argued for severance because that

6

would then convert Initiative 872 into a truly

7

nonpartisan primary, but that's not what was on the

8

ballot.

If you take a look at -- it's JA 400.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm confused about the

10

difference between a facial challenge and an as-applied

11

challenge.

12

There's no evidence out there that this has ever -- this

13

has ever been a problem, so you've got to attack it

14

right away, but then you have this relief that basically

15

enjoins the whole -- whole procedure.

16

On the one hand, it's very helpful to you.

MR. WHITE:

Well, the Court asked General

17

McKenna a question during his argument about whether the

18

problem had ever occurred with a false-flag candidate

19

capturing a party's name on the ballot.

under Initiative 872 because it was enjoined before

21

being effective.

23

It has not

But at page JA 239 there's testimony

highly improbable if you have a nominee as a result of a

25

convention, everybody reads the newspapers, they know

MR. WHITE:

No, but it's the only

19

information presented to the -- the voters at the

20

critical moment when they're casting their ballot, and

21

as this Court has noted in -- with respect to term

MR. WHITE:

I think the question there, Your

in putting that information on the ballot?

does share the views of either the Republican or

preference may be because that independent is running in

believe what the Republicans are, whether that candidate

25

As we've shown in the samples, there will be

distinguishes the expression of party preference.

is that even under the ballot on page one, what is not
