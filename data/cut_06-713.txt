ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. McKENNA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. McKENNA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14

voters followed this Court's guidance in California

election system.

17

crucial constitutional defect of a partisan blanket

18

primary because in the top-two system the voters are no

19

longer selecting the party's nominees for the November

20

election.

21

Initiative 872 is unconstitutional, holding that

22

allowing each candidate to state his or her personal

23

party preference on the ballot would create the

24

appearance of association between a political party and

25

candidate.

They adopted a top-two

The Ninth Circuit is wrong for at least two

reasons.

4

will look the same as ballots under a party nominating

5

election system.

6

First, the Ninth Circuit's appearance-

They will not.

The top-two ballot -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can you give us

7

assurance that they will not?

8

9

know what the ballots are going to look like.

MR. McKENNA:

I take it we don't -- we

That's

11

correct.

13

having the opportunity to promulgate the regulations

14

governing the ballot after 872's adoption.

We have not had an election, and the secretary

16

declaration of candidacy form, which the secretary of

17

state did have the opportunity to promulgate, which

18

appears in the corrected joint appendix at pages

19

592-593.

20

Justice, is that, unlike the old declaration of

21

candidacy form, we have the candidates declaring

22

themselves as a candidate for the office of blank, and

23

instead of saying that they're a candidate of a party,

24

they say -- that you have an opportunity to check off

25

the box that my party preference is blank or I'm -- I am

And what we see there, Your Honor, Mr. Chief

an independent candidate; or, under Initiative 872, if

2

they check neither box, that will be left blank on the

3

ballot.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you say that the purpose

5

of allowing a candidate to declare a preference is

6

simply to convey useful information to voters, but once

7

you decided, once the State decided, that the ballot was

8

not going to indicate party affiliation, why do you

9

limit candidates to the names of parties?

Why don't you

10

allow them to pick some other phrase that better

11

expresses their point of view?

12

say, I'm the pro-environment candidate, or I'm the

13

no-new-taxes candidate.

14

Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, et cetera?

15

Somebody may want to

Why do you limit them to saying

MR. McKENNA:

Your Honor, the voters could

16

have chosen to allow candidates to include other

17

information.

18

candidates were given five words they could use for

19

whatever expression they wished.

20

to allow an expression of party preference, which the

21

State is allowed to do.

22

allow the ballot to be a form -- forum for political

23

expression, but the State is allowed to do so and has

24

chosen to do in this way.

25

In fact, in the State's earliest days

But the voters chose

purpose that was offered by the proponent of the

2

initiative to try to get around the decision in Jones,

3

to change the system as little as possible?

4

MR. McKENNA:

No, Your Honor, because there

is an immense difference between the top-two system and

position that the parties are not really injured or

12

affected by this, and the parties' position is that they

13

are, who should we believe?

to tell the parties that they don't know what's in their

MR. McKENNA:

Justice Scalia, there may be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

two examples of what the ballot is likely to look like,

the parties are now free to come up with any scheme they

convention could state on the ballot not merely a

preference for Democrats, but a statement that, I am the

Stevens, no.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't think the law can

have it both ways.

3

MR. McKENNA:

Your Honor, if I can use an

4

example that might help illustrate our point.

Imagine

5

that Mr. Dale from the Boy Scouts v. Dale case moved to

6

Washington State and wanted to run for office, and

7

imagine that, instead of saying party preference, the

8

voters had said, well, you can choose to list any

9

organization for which you have a preference, a

10

political organization or another; and that Mr. Dale

11

decided to express a preference for the Boy Scouts.

12

Mr. Dale would be exercising his own speech, but that

13

would not be the same thing as compelling speech by the

14

Boy Scouts.

15

Nor would he be compelling CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Nobody is voting for

16

Mr. Dale perhaps on the misimpression that he is

17

affiliated with the Boy Scouts, and that's what

undermines the Boy Scouts' associational rights.

Do you agree that if

it were that way, in other words if the ballot looked

like the ballot on page 1 of the Grange reply brief,

5

that that would be unconstitutional?

6

MR. McKENNA:

Yes, Your Honor, it would be

7

harder to argue from our side.

But Your Honor, the

8

Ninth Circuit only assumed that the ballot would look

9

like the ballot on page 1 of the Grange yellow brief.

10

They assumed that the ballot would look exactly like the

11

that it will not.

statements continue under the general election?

15

I was about to say, there is a very important practical

16

reason to require candidates to decide what their

18

The reason is that we have to have time to print the

You did say

Official - Subject to Final Review

that, and on what basis are you predicting that the

statement of preference will not be confused with a

statement of endorsement?

4

MR. McKENNA:

On two bases, Justice

5

Ginsburg.

6

the sample ballots from the Grange brief, the State will

7

be extremely explicit in stating that the candidate's

8

claim of preference or statement of preference is not

the party's statement that the candidate is a member,

10

The first basis is that, as we've shown with

endorsee, nominee, or what have you.

11

The second basis is I think just the general

12

basis this Court has recognized in Tasjian and in

13

Anderson v. Cellebreze, where the Court expressed a

14

greater faith in the ability of individual voters to

inform themselves beyond just the balance.

I don't think it's enough

18

that -- that there's no claim of party endorsement.

19

There is a claim of associating himself with the party,

20

and if he associates himself with the party it seems to

21

me the party should be able to disassociate itself from

22

him.

23

And I think it harms the party not to permit that.
MR. McKENNA:

No, Justice Scalia, I

24

respectfully disagree.

This is not an association in

25

the constitutional sense.

It is merely an expression of
19

preference, which we -- which Initiative 872 in its open

2

language and which the ballot will carefully distinguish

3

from claiming a formal association.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you know any Democrats

5

who go around saying I prefer the Democratic Party who

6

do not regard themselves and register themselves as

7

Democrats?

8

that -- I don't know whether this is fatal to your case,

9

but in the real world, it seems to me the distinction

I mean, in the real world I don't know

10

you're drawing is simply not drawn.

11

MR. McKENNA:

Your Honor, I think it's

12

helpful to think of the expression of party preference

13

as a subset of party affiliation.

14

someone might be a party affiliate -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In other words,

It's helpful to your case,

16

but, going back to my question, do you know any people

17

who go around saying, well, you know, I really prefer

18

the Democrats; I'm a Republican myself?

19

that doesn't happen.

20

MR. McKENNA:

I mean that,

Well, the example of Senator

21

Lieberman comes to mind, where he said I really prefer

22

the Democrats and I'm running as an independent.

But seriously, as a systemic matter, do you

There's always one.

2

would recognize?

3

I think that we are permitted

4

to allow people to express their preference.

5

these people who do so would be independents, I think.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Many of

No, but that isn't

responsive to my question.

that distinction is a distinction which is accepted as a

9

working way of thinking in this world?

MR. McKENNA:

Do you really think that

Yes.

Yes, I do, Justice

Souter.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. McKENNA:

You really do?

In Washington State over 40

14

percent of the voters, for example, identify themselves

15

by -- as independents.

registration in Washington State, over 40 percent of

17

voters when asked say I'm an independent; I may -- and

18

that does not mean they may not prefer one party over

19

the other, they may not generally vote for one party or

20

the other, but they think of themselves as independent.

21

Keeping in mind we have no party

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it means that they -

22

they will prefer the candidate of one party or another,

23

assuming they vote and there's no independent candidate

24

running.

25

the very assumption of status as an independent says, I

But it seems to me that the very declaration,

2

other; a pox on both their houses.

3

MR. McKENNA:

Justice Souter, it may also

4

mean that I choose not to formally affiliate with the

5

party, even though I prefer that party's policies,

6

goals.

You look at the independent -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It could.

But do you

8

really think, again, in the real world, that that's why

9

people register themselves as independents?

is made.

MR. McKENNA:

There have been a number of

attend the caucus meetings of the Democratic Party, for

18

example.

19

that people are allowed to do this, but they're not

20

required to.

21

So, yes, it does happen.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the point is

General McKenna, I'm

22

interested in how this new system meshes with the

23

otherwise quite partisan nature of Washington's election

24

laws.

25

certain -- certain benefits that are not given to minor

For example, the major political parties have a

22
Alderson Reporting Company

parties, and the major parties are determined on the

2

basis of obtaining more than a certain percentage, I

3

think it's 5 percent, in a statewide election.

4

you going to figure out whether the Republican Party

5

has, has gotten more than 5 percent when all you have is

6

somebody who expresses a preference for the Republican

7

Party, although he's not really a Republican?

8
9

MR. McKENNA:

How are

Your Honor, as legal counsel

for the State we've analyzed that question, and have

10

concluded that unless and until the legislature chooses

11

to alter the statute to harmonize at a practical level,

12

the way that we will apply that statute is to count the

13

votes of the party cast for the party's official

14

nominee.

15

through their separate nominating process, for example,

16

through a convention, that person will be identified.

17

And they will campaign as "the nominee."

18

explain that to the voters in every way possible, and we

will count the votes cast for that person in calculating

20

whether the 5 percent threshold has been met.

MR. McKENNA:

2

I would just like to close this part of my

is a value that was validated in the Jones decision,

albeit holding that you can't do that with nonmembers

The parties, though, argue that no candidate

can even state an expression of party preference, cannot

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. WHITE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Candidates are the party's messengers to win

7

over the public on the important issues of the day.

8

Initiative 872 converts the established right of

9

political parties to select their messengers into a mere

10
11

right to endorse.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you -- what do you

12

say about the fact that you have a right to select and

13

designate an official candidate and it's independent of

14

this ballot procedures?

15

MR. WHITE:

As the secretary of state

16

pointed out -- and this is at JA-363 -- the secretary of

17

state indicated the State would pay no attention to the

18

party's nominating conventions and instead would

19

continue to allow candidates to use party labels just as

20

they had in the primary before.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

If the rationale in

22

Jones was that the defect was that the association,

23

political association, was being adulterated by the

24

method of, of the use of ballots, to select what was an

25

official nominee, that problem does not exist here.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WHITE:

It does, it does, Your Honor.

2

And it does in the manner that this -- the candidates

3

who were selected at the Initiative 872, the modified

4

blanket primary, are going to be carrying the party's

5

standard in the general election.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You're saying in practical

7

terms, this is a nomination, even though there may be a

8

separate official nomination that nobody pays attention

9

to?

10

MR. WHITE:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then why is one party going

12

13

make nominations?

4

nothing indicating an official nomination on the ballot

5

itself.

6

through a convention, or whatever other scheme they can

7

come up with, can -- can designate an official nominee

quite independently of this ballot.

But as I -- I am also assuming that the parties

And if they do so

10

The person in campaigning can say, I am the official

11

nominee of the X party.

12

aren't they?

13

MR. WHITE:

And those facts are true,

They are, Your Honor, but that

14

converts the right to nominate to a mere right to

15

endorse, and this Court has recognized that the ability

16

to endorse a candidate is no substitute -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You're saying that a right

18

to nominate has to be a right to exclude everyone from

19

the ballot except the nominee -- everyone from the

20

ballot under that banner, from the nominee.

21
22

MR. WHITE:

To be -- to be a meaningful

right to nominate, yes, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It -

Where does that right

24

come from?

I thought in Jones, the Court had said if

25

you had just a blanket primary, with no indication of
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

party affiliation, that that would be constitutional.

2

And if that's so, then parties don't have any right to

3

have a candidate.

4

MR. WHITE:

I'm not suggesting that the

5

parties have a constitutional right to place their party

6

name on a truly nonpartisan ballot, and I think what the

7

Jones Court was hypothesizing was the true nonpartisan

8

primary where there are no party identifications.

rhetorical flourish.

That it's just say a statement

10

of preference, that that's all it means; the voters know

this.

Is your position the same?
MR. WHITE:

Yes, Your Honor.

The notion

13

that disclaimers are necessary, and the State indicates

14

that they will spend a million dollars to try to clear

this up, is evidence of the confusion that's likely to

occur.

MR. WHITE:

Well, if you have the

question of what legitimate State interest is being

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You -- you have identified

-- in the course of your argument, you've identified two

6

separate problems with the -- with the scheme as you see

7

it.

8

of an official nominee, and the other is that it in

9

effect allows competition on the ballot by a person

10
11

One is, as you put it, that it masks the identity

under the same party banner with the official nominee.
MR. WHITE:

Yes.

After the party has

12

already resolved its internal disputes and determined

13

who its spokesman will be, the State allows -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

-- any candidate to appropriate

the name and compete against our nominee.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

realize there is a certain awkwardness to this, but we

21

of the candidate is the real flaw, then the -- the

22

hypothetical that was included in the -- in Jones, in

23

the dictum, of the -- of the party that -- of the ballot

24

that has no party identification whatsoever, that would

25

equally be bad, wouldn't it?

If the masking of the identity

38
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WHITE:

No, Your Honor, because what it

2

is, in this instance, Initiative 872 is a partisan

3

primary that would mask the identity of the party

4

nominee.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if it's the masking

6

that's the problem, the -- the nominee is going to be

7

just as well masked on the ballot or better masked on

8

the ballot that allows no statement of preference at

9

all.

10

MR. WHITE:

No, Justice -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -- and I'm not saying

12

that that's fatally your case, but I mean it's -- it's

13

something we need to be careful about when we're doing

14

our thinking, and that's why I'm pressing you on it.

15

MR. WHITE:

Well -- and I think it's -- it's

16

the masking in the context of a partisan system.

17

State may elect to have nonpartisan offices, and many

18

local offices throughout the West are nonpartisan.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

But if -- but if it's just

20

masking in a partisan system, then it seems to me you're

21

making the same argument that you make when you say, by

22

allowing statements of preference, we obscure the

23

character of the official nominee and in effect allow

24

somebody to have a -- a second shot at -- at getting

25

Republican support as a Republican.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

It seems to me that if it's masking in a

2

partisan ballot that's the real problem, there's only

3

one objection and the objection is not so much the

4

masking as it is the submergence of the official

5

nomination by allowing competition under the party's

6

name by another candidate.

7

MR. WHITE:

Isn't that fair to say?

I -- I think, Justice Souter,

8

that it -- that it is two separate inquiries.

First you

9

have the difficulty that as a practical matter these

10

candidates will be identified as Republican nominees or

11

Republican candidates, but even if the State were able

12

to posit sufficient disclaimers and caveats, that the

13

State has shown no valid interest in allowing a

14

candidate to use the name -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask this question:

This is a facial challenge, is it not?

4

MR. WHITE:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what exactly -- what

6

relief did the district court grant?

7

entire blanket primary or just the designation of

8

parties?

9

MR. WHITE:

Did he enjoin the

The district court enjoined the

10

entirety of Initiative 872 because it determined that

11

the party preference provisions of Initiative 872 were

12

not severable under Washington State's test for

13

severability.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think that was the

15

narrowest relief he could have granted to avoid the

16

constitutional difficulty that you see?

think that was the appropriate, and it is a narrow

relief.

21

The court looked at the structure of the

provision was just deleted?

2

MR. WHITE:

I'm not -- I'm not sure that it

3

would, Your Honor.

I'm not sure that it would because

4

-- and what the State and the Grange argued below is

5

that -- they actually argued for severance because that

6

would then convert Initiative 872 into a truly

7

nonpartisan primary, but that's not what was on the

8

ballot.

If you take a look at -- it's JA 400.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm confused about the

10

difference between a facial challenge and an as-applied

11

challenge.

12

There's no evidence out there that this has ever -- this

13

has ever been a problem, so you've got to attack it

14

right away, but then you have this relief that basically

15

enjoins the whole -- whole procedure.

16

On the one hand, it's very helpful to you.

MR. WHITE:

Well, the Court asked General

17

McKenna a question during his argument about whether the

18

problem had ever occurred with a false-flag candidate

19

capturing a party's name on the ballot.

20

under Initiative 872 because it was enjoined before

21

being effective.

23

It has not

But at page JA 239 there's testimony

convention, everybody reads the newspapers, they know

critical moment when they're casting their ballot, and

that the ballot has one candidate who says, Smith,

MR. WHITE:

I think the question there, Your

2

in putting that information on the ballot?

3

reply brief at page 6, the State says an independent who

does share the views of either the Republican or

5

6

preference may be because that independent is running in

a district that's 70 percent Republican.

question is, what is the legitimate interest of the

whether it's the letter as on page one of the Grange

25

As we've shown in the samples, there will be

distinguishes the expression of party preference.
