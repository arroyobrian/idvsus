ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. O'CONNOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

This case is about the authority of the


11

Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assess FICA taxes that


12

Congress has imposed on employers.

13

well-established principle of tax litigation.

14

two key sections of the Internal Revenue Code and how they


15

relate to each other, and it involves the evidentiary


16

value of assessment in tax litigation.


17

It also involves the

It involves


The first of the key sections is section 6201.

It appears at page 62a of the appendix to our petition. 


19

It authorizes and requires the Secretary of the Treasury


20

to make inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all


21

taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.

QUESTION:
I'm --

4

Which section is this, Ms. O'Connor? 


MS. O'CONNOR:

Section 3111 at page 55a of our


appendix to the petition.


5

QUESTION:

Thank you.


6

MS. O'CONNOR:

This is the tax that imposes --


7

this is the provision that imposes a tax on the wages


8

employers pay or are deemed to have paid their employees.


9

The question this case presents is how the


10

commissioner carries out his obligation under 6201 to


11

assess the tax that is imposed by section 3111.

12

is --


13

QUESTION:

The tax


Ms. O'Connor, let me tell you what


14

troubles me a little about the Government's position in


15

the case, and I hope you will address this.

16

employer ever challenge effectively an assessment made


17

under the position that you approach, because the normal


18

burden of proof in a tax refund case normally requires the


19

employer to show exactly how much money was owed, and I


20

don't see how that would work in this context.


21

MS. O'CONNOR:

Exactly, Your Honor.

How can an


The


22

Congress has recognized the difficulty that employers have


23

in this regard, and that is the reason there are several


24

of the other sections that we will discussing this


25

morning.

Section 6205, for example, is mentioned in your

materials.

2

their own, if they discover an error, to correct it later


3

and have no interest assessed.

4

provision, and it relates specifically to the complexity


5

of employment taxes and their administration.


6

That is a provision that permits employers on


QUESTION:

That's a very unusual


Well, would that error ever be


7

anything more than a disparity between what the employee


8

reported and what the employer reported?


9

MS. O'CONNOR:

10

QUESTION:

Would what, Your Honor?


How -- I mean, the error that that


11

section -- I'm wondering what the error is that that


12

section contemplates, and I can see it's application,


13

let's say, if the employer simply added up the employee's


14

reports wrong and got the wrong figure.

15

circumstances would it apply short of the moment at which


16

the Government makes the assessment which is in question


17

here?


18

MS. O'CONNOR:

Under what other


It could also apply just -- and


19

6205 is not specific to restaurants or food or beverage


20

establishments or tips at all, because another common


21

error that employers can sometimes make is


22

mischaracterizing a worker as an independent contractor,


23

for example, and upon determining later that the person is


24

actually an employee and they should be withholding

another way.

situation?

this is -- I didn't mean to side-track you from Justice


5

O'Connor's question, but I'll raise the thing that bothers


6

me.

report is the sum total of all the reports that the


8

employees give to the employer of tip income.


9
10
11

How would it -- how could it apply in this

In other words, as I understand it -- I mean,


As I understand it, what the employer is obligated to


MS. O'CONNOR:
QUESTION:

That's right, Your Honor.


And I'll assume for the sake of the


question that a given employer has done that.


12

MS. O'CONNOR:

13

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.


I also assume that if you are


14

correct, that employer has this possibility hanging over


15

it that the IRS is going to make this kind of an


16

assessment.


17

MS. O'CONNOR:

18

QUESTION:

That --


Is there any -- my question is, is


19

there any way that the employer can anticipate this kind


20

of an assessment in order at least to avoid the interest


21

running under this section?


22

MS. O'CONNOR:

Absolutely.

There are many


23

different ways, Your Honor, and this case provides a very


24

good example.

25

monthly basis to employers.

Employees are required to report on a

You can see from the forms

6

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

8027, which are at pages 38 and 39 of the joint appendix,


2

those are the forms that this restaurant filed for 1991


3

and 1992.


4

QUESTION:

5

MS. O'CONNOR:

6

And they were all correct, I take it.

Right, those forms were


absolutely correct. 


7

You will also note at the top of the page it


8

says that it is an information report, because this is


9

information that Congress has required food and beverage


10

establishments to provide to the Internal Revenue Service


11

exactly for a purpose such as this.


12

Now, the annual -- the information report at


13

pages 38 and 39 is an annual report that the food and


14

beverage establishment provides to the Internal Revenue


15

Service, but employees provide reports to employers at


16

least monthly.

17

percent of the sales of this restaurant were paid for by


18

credit card, so every single month this restaurant could


19

have compared the tips that employees were reporting with


20

the tips that they saw were being charged on credit cards,


21

and as any business owner would do when faced with a


22

liability that could occur down the road, you're going to


23

set up a reserve for it.


24
25

You will see on the forms 8027 that 90


You know you have got your annual insurance

premium due next January.

You start setting aside for it.

1

QUESTION:

He may set up -- the employer may set


2

up a reserve, but as I understand it the employer is not


3

obligated, in effect, to withhold upon himself, is not


4

obligated to pay the tax on it until the assessment comes,


5

because under the IRS' instructions the employer pays the


6

tax on the amounts reported to the employer even if he


7

knows they're wrong.


8
9

MS. O'CONNOR:

That's exactly right, and that's


another indication of the fact that Congress realized that


10

this was going to be a difficult provision for employers


11

to enact.


12

QUESTION:

Well, what would he do --


13

MS. O'CONNOR:

14

QUESTION:

31 --


What would he do to anticipate it? 


15

Would he say, I'm paying you another $10,000, I don't


16

happen to owe you that in tax now, I paid what the law


17

requires me to pay, and you haven't assessed anything


18

else, but here's another $10,000?

19

you're anticipating?


20

MS. O'CONNOR:

I mean, is that what


Absolutely not, Your Honor.

In


21

fact, it is the rare taxpayer who seeks to pay his tax


22

before it's called for.


23

(Laughter.)


24

QUESTION:

25

All right, then how does the taxpayer


take advantage of the provision that allows him to make a

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

correction and avoid the interest in this case?


2

MS. O'CONNOR:

Well, one of the things that is


3

somewhat troublesome about some of the briefs in front of


4

you from the other side is that the other side is looking


5

at this as though it was a penalty, and it's not a


6

penalty, it's merely a tax.

7

are no penalties.

Let me point out --

situation.

I will assume -- no, I will assume


I just want to know how it works in this


He doesn't owe any tax --


11

MS. O'CONNOR:

QUESTION:

13

In fact, there specifically


Right.


-- based on what he has to report to


you.


14

MS. O'CONNOR:

15

QUESTION:

Right.


You haven't assessed anything yet. 


16

How can he possibly take advantage of the provision that


17

allows him to make a correction, to pay in accordance with


18

that correction, and to avoid any interest that he would


19

otherwise be liable for?

20

MS. O'CONNOR:

How can he take advantage of it?

Well, let me point out a couple


21

of things from your question, Justice Souter.

First, let


22

me direct you to 3121(q).

23

Revenue Code provide a couple of things.

24

what is tax, how is the tax measured, when is it


25

measured --

QUESTION:

Where is 2131(q)?


2

MS. O'CONNOR:

3121(q) is in our joint appendix


3

here -- oh, no, no, it's in the petition.

4

3121(q) is at 58(a).

5

QUESTION:

Thank you. 


Thank you very much.

General O'Connor, it might help if


6

you answered specifically whether interest does run on the


7

period between the employer paying what the employee's


8

reports call for and the assessment at a higher amount.


9

MS. O'CONNOR:

Thank you, Justice Ginsburg.

No,


10

there is no interest that runs, and that's why I wanted


11

you to look at 3121(q) in particular.


12

QUESTION:

13

application here?

14

and --


Then how does this section have an

You say, well, this mitigates it,


15

MS. O'CONNOR:

16

QUESTION:

No, I'm sorry --


-- it seems to me that about all the


17

employer can do is pay immediately at the moment of your


18

assessment and therefore no interest will run.


19

MS. O'CONNOR:

No, I did not mean to suggest


20

that 6205 applied to this assessment, and in fact it


21

doesn't.

22

an error and corrects it at the next available


23

opportunity.


24
25

6205 applies when the employer himself discovers


QUESTION:

So it wouldn't apply in these


circumstances.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. O'CONNOR:

It doesn't need to, because under


2

3121(q) -- it's a very interesting provision.

3

provides definitions, that's all.

4

subchapter of the Internal Revenue Code that provides for


5

these employment taxes, and (q) is the definitional


6

provision that says that tips are wages.

7

you when the tips are wages.


8
9

3121


It resides in the


It also tells


For the purposes of the employer FICA 3121(q)

tells you that the wages are deemed to have been paid when


10

the employee reports them or if the employer -- employee


11

doesn't report them, they are wages deemed to be paid when


12

the IRS issues notice of demand, so until the IRS notifies


13

the restaurant that there is an additional FICA tax due,


14

there is no interest or penalty.


15

QUESTION:

Right, but at that point there is,


16

and if you would come back to Justice O'Connor's question,


17

which was, how could the employer ever know that there was


18

a mistake in the assessment, and you said, well, as soon


19

as he knows it, he can come forward with the additional


20

amount and there won't be any penalty, but how does he


21

know it?

22

That's the problem.

MS. O'CONNOR:

He knows it because the employees


23

are reporting on a monthly basis, and in this case there


24

was clearly -- we have $120,000 of unreported credit card


25

tips in each of the 2 years involved here, $120,000 in

unreported credit card tips.

every month.

Those reports were coming in


The restaurant has clear notice --

But your assessment is for more than

that.

of cash tips as well.

6

the employer going to know whether that's erroneous or


7

not?


8
9

Your assessment assumed a certain unreported amount

Now, how is the reporter -- how is


MS. O'CONNOR:

The same method that he would use


to make any other determination.

For example, he knows by


10

the basis of the report that all credit card tips are not


11

being reported.


12

QUESTION:

But the burden is on him.

The burden


13

is on him to show what the proper amount was.

14

comes up with a guess based on, well, we assume that the


15

same amount weren't reported for cash tips as weren't


16

reported for credit card tips, pay up.


17

I mean, IRS


Now, how is he going to prove that there was a


18

different amount for --


19

MS. O'CONNOR:

You're exactly right, Justice


20

Scalia, the burden is on the taxpayer, and in this case


21

the taxpayer conceded the entire amount of the judgment. 


22

Page 35 of the joint appendix --

But the burden is on the taxpayer to

give information as to which the taxpayer is not in the


25

best position to know, and --

MS. O'CONNOR:

2

QUESTION:

That's true, Justice Kennedy.


-- Justice O'Connor's original


3

question was, how is the employer supposed to know, and


4

you say, well, if he doesn't know he can amend later.


5

The whole question is, and the gravamen of the


6

argument put forth by the taxpayer here is that the


7

assessment should be on the person, or on the entity that


8

has the information, and here your information is as good


9

as the employer's, and you have the ability to do what the


10

employer can't, i.e., subpoena the individual records of


11

the employees.


12

MS. O'CONNOR:

Actually, not all of that is


13

true, Justice Kennedy.

15

certainly could subpoena records of the employee in a


16

matter such as that, and respondent, as you say, does --

QUESTION:

The employer, if there were a


How does he do that, sue the


employee?

dispute between the two over any matter the employer


21

certainly could.

No, just as a general

case --


2

QUESTION:

Well, as a general proposition I


3

don't think the employer can subpoena the employee.

4

mean, you have to have a legal proceeding, don't you?


5
6

MS. O'CONNOR:
Your Honor.

7

Oh, exactly.

I


That's what I mean,


If there were some other legal proceeding --


QUESTION:

Well, but I mean, that's not going to


8

work.

You're suggesting that he ought to fire the


9

employee and then be subjected to a wrongful discharge


10

suit and then subpoena the information so that he can give


11

it to you.

12

Why don't you just ask for it?

MS. O'CONNOR:

Well, actually, there is no


13

evidence in the record on whether the individual employees


14

were audited or not.

15

opinion, TRAC is asserted on that point.


16
17
18

QUESTION:

I saw that in the Ninth Circuit


But the point is, you have the


capacity to do it and the employee doesn't.

MS. O'CONNOR:

That's true, Justice Kennedy. 


19

The amount of assessment, though, I think it's very


20

important to focus on the fact that in this case, as you


21

can see at page 35 of the joint appendix, the taxpayer


22

here conceded the reasonableness of the assessment,


23

conceded it.


24
25

QUESTION:

Then that's just luck, because I


thought Justice O'Connor's original question was, look, we

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

can all do this, it's so simple.

percent times the gross receipts of every restaurant in


3

the country, all right.

4

what is the restaurant owner supposed to do to show that


5

that's inaccurate, what can he do, and so far my own


6

conclusion listening to you is, he can write the check.


7

MS. O'CONNOR:

8

QUESTION:

9

You multiply 14.3


Now, I thought her question was,


I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --


Now, is there anything else -- is


there anything else that this restaurant owner has it in


10

his power to do, other than write the check, and not some


11

theoretical thing.

12

practicality of it.


What I'm interested in is the


13

MS. O'CONNOR:

15

MS. O'CONNOR:

Absolutely, Your Honor --


What is that?

-- and I don't mean to be


16

avoiding the question.

18

to 8 percent, and then there's a blank and it says, or


19

lower percentage.

20

restaurant employees are reporting tips that are less than


21

8 percent of gross sales, that could raise a red flag that


22

maybe the restaurant worker --

I'll save that question.

I'm interested in the answer to


12

Justice O'Connor's question in what I'd call the mind run,


13

mainstream, basic, typical situation, and that is, what is


14

that answer?

So far I'm concluding he can do nothing.


15

MS. O'CONNOR:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. O'CONNOR:

No.


Tell me the answer.

What the restaurant can do is


18

show evidence that would tend to determine, or help


19

determine the amount of the tip, how many -- what kind of


20

a restaurant you have, how upscale it is, where it's


21

located, the kind of meals you serve -- in fact, the IRS


22

has a procedure where restaurants can show all that


23

information, a sample menu to get below the 8 percent.

QUESTION:

And then I'm not being clear.

All right.

Now, we're only talking


8

about an area that's well above that, and in respect to


9

the area well above that.

Here it happened to be between


10

$200,000 and about $350,000.

11

$150,000, you come in and say, we're sure that it was


12

earned in tips, and now here's what you did.

13

multiplied gross receipts by 14.3 percent, and you


14

subtracted the $200,000, okay.

15

that, and I thought Justice O'Connor's question was, you

are a restaurant owner.

commitment, and that is an alternative to justifying or


20

trying to establish -- in this case, though, let me point


21

out that at any point during the IRS' examination the


22

taxpayer could have shown, could have produced information

that would have reduced the number that you see on Exhibit

MS. O'CONNOR:

Well, magically, since its


concession in the district court, at the appellate level


10

and again in its briefs before this Court, the respondent


11

has come up with all sorts of ideas that might challenge


12

the amount of the assessment.

13

QUESTION:

Even if the --

stipulation in this case that they are not contesting the

18

what's in this for the revenue, because of the -- the


19

provision you haven't mentioned, 45B gives the restaurant


20

a credit against income tax, dollar for dollar, for the


21

FICA tax, and let's assume we have employers, most of them


22

are paying at least the minimum wage, what gain is there


23

to the revenue whichever way this comes out?


24
25

I have a question that I think Justice Breyer has


MS. O'CONNOR:

We don't know whether the


taxpayer here was paying the minimum wage, because none of

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that was in the record, because the assessment amount was


2

conceded.

3

only for tips that are not used by the employer to satisfy


4

his minimum wage obligations, yet it's not a complete wash


5

to the Treasury, however, because you still have the FICA


6

tax being paid in and an income tax credit being given, so


7

it's the trust fund accounting that would have a problem


8

if you look at it as a complete offset.

9

Government side it's not a complete offset at all.

The 45B credit, as you point out, is available

QUESTION:

From the point of view of the

MS. O'CONNOR:

From the point of view of the

satisfy their minimum wage requirement, and on this record

we don't know.

QUESTION:

And if they don't, it won't make

QUESTION:

But the question -- and to overstate


4

the point -- I'm not buying into this argument at the


5

moment, but I do want to hear your response.

briefs I have the impression that it doesn't make a lot of

difference to the Government in this case.

It would make


10

taxicabs, hairdressers, newspaper boys, and anyone else


11

who is in a business where people receive tips, and in


12

respect to those kinds of cases it gives the Government a

weapon.


14

In this case, it's being used to force them into

a TRAC program that they don't want to enter.

to people because, of course, a lot of income is

1

opportunity to answer that, because I want to hear what


2

the answer is.


3

MS. O'CONNOR:

Congress had the opportunity to


4

say that no, the IRS does not have the authority to do


5

what has been referred to here as aggregate assessment,


6

and I might just point out here that rather than aggregate


7

assessments, which is what the respondent calls what has


8

happened here, respondent would prefer the individual


9

audits and aggregating the estimates, because certainly


10

they would be estimates if they were done on the basis of


11

the individual waiter's reports also.


12

But in 1998, when Congress said that the IRS


13

cannot use a threat of an assessment like this to force


14

restaurants into a TRAC, it clearly had the opportunity to


15

say, and besides, you don't have the authority to do these


16

estimates anyway, these assessments anyway.

17

is very clear, and the only thing that the respondent has


18

ever argued here is that the amount might be wrong, and


19

they can't tell you exactly what it is, but there is no


20

rule that an assessment has to be entirely accurate or


21

precise.

22

determinations, and that's what's happened here.


23

25

The authority


The assessment authority requires inquiries and


QUESTION:

The assessment is presumptively


correct, isn't it, under the statute?

MS. O'CONNOR:

Not under the statute, Justice

1

assessments and their evidentiary value in tax litigation.

QUESTION:

In United States v.


Well, you take the position it is


presumed to be correct, don't you?

MS. O'CONNOR:

It is -- United States v. Janis


8

stands for the proposition that an assessment is valid


9

unless it is without any foundation.

Clearly, here, when


10

the assessment is based on the respondent's own report,


11

and more than three-quarters of the assessment is on the


12

amounts that are clearly known to be true, clearly this


13

foundation, this assessment has a foundation.

14

once you've established that the assessment is not


15

invalid, that it has a foundation at all, then you start

talking about the amount.

QUESTION:

-- 1 penny on the dollar is accurate,


that -- it has a foundation?

Is that what it means?

It


couldn't mean that.

MS. O'CONNOR:

Oh, I think that would be pushing


12

it a little far, Your Honor, and that's not what United


13

States v. Janis requires.


14

QUESTION:

I would think it would mean that


15

there's some reason to believe the full amount is


16

accurate, not that three-quarters of it is accurate.


17

MS. O'CONNOR:

That's not what this Court has


18

held, particularly United States v. Janis, where in fact


19

the assessment there was based on an estimate of wage-


20

earning practice.

21

the commission assessed on 77 days worth of wages.


22

QUESTION:

By looking at 5 days' worth of wages


Sure, but doesn't the Janis rule


23

assume that the taxpayer is, in fact, in a position to


24

prove the correct figure if the assessment is wrong?


25

MS. O'CONNOR:

Not necessarily, Your Honor, and

25

Alderson Reporting Company

it is incumbent upon any taxpayer upon whom a tax is

imposed to maintain whatever books and records they can.

QUESTION:

Exactly, and that comes back to the


question I've asked before.

5

MS. O'CONNOR:

What can this taxpayer do?


Well, the taxpayer is in a

business that requires a lot of things.

safety, and sanitation regulations.

done.

14

Since they didn't challenge the assessment or


QUESTION:

Well, short of the restaurant's


15

hiring someone to bird dog every single waiter and

17

how the employer here could collect the information.


18

The gambler, sure, he can write it down in his


19

little book, but I don't see where the employer here is in


20

a position to get the figure to write down in a little


21

book, short of having a third person follow every --

his tips in a little book, and there are --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TRACY J. POWER


13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


14

MS. POWER:

May it please the Court, Your Honor:


15

Congress did not saddle the employer with a tax


16

while depriving him of any way to defend against it. 


17

Congress did not require the employer to do what for 30


18

years it told him it was not required to do. This tax is


19

not authorized.

20

the burden of proof and the presumption of correctness.


21

Because it's not authorized, that affects


I'd like to suggest an analogy.

If Congress had


22

passed a tax on my chickens and the IRS came along and


23

said, we're imposing a tax on you, on your neighbor's


24

cows, and I said, but I don't owe a tax on my neighbor's


25

cows, and they in turn said, yes, well, what we did was,

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

we figured your neighbor had X number of acres and


2

therefore the average number of cows per acre is Y, and


3

you owe the tax on the cows, and I said, well, I'm not


4

going to fight that because I don't have any way to know


5

how many cows my neighbor had.


6

QUESTION:

But can I just ask one question that


7

really puzzles me in this case?

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

I can't follow the cows and all --


10

(Laughter.)


11

MS. POWER:

QUESTION:

I understand.

But you did have records, written


13

records that showed that the actual amount of tips paid by


14

credit card and so forth to the people in question here


15

was substantially larger than you reported.

that put you on notice that you owed a little money to the


17

We do not know to what extent, if


19

any, those credit card tip amounts, or the amount on the

QUESTION:

It could be as simple as an

But don't you know what the practice


is in your own restaurants?


11

MS. POWER:

We would know what -- each

individual restaurant would know what is done in basic


13

practice in their restaurant, but how much, if any, of


14

that credit card amount was retained by any individual, we


15

do not know.

QUESTION:

No, but what may -- I understand the

waiter may have split the tips with the busboy and so

MS. POWER:

and I didn't have any cash in my pocket and I said to the

waiter, you know, I'm going to leave some extra tip on


18

here, I need to pay for the valet when I leave, I'm going

to put $5 extra on here, can you give me the cash -- yes,

it's possible that there's tips on there.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

says -- it doesn't say -- it says the employer, there is


2

imposed on the employer an excise tax equal to 6.2 percent


3

of wages, and it says, including tips, so I don't see

how -- what your argument is that the tax isn't

authorized.

MS. POWER:

But it's wages of an individual


employee.

Of course it's authorized.


QUESTION:

Yes, that's right, and the employer


has to --

MS. POWER:

It's wages -- and they have, what


11

their assessment stands for is a tax on my gross tip

payroll.

13

There has been no -- that is not a tax --

QUESTION:

No, no, but I -- I understand that


14

basic point.

15

think would be, despite the rights and wrongs of it, their


16

very strong legal position, which is very simple. 


17

Number 1, that there is assessed here a tax on the


18

employer equal to 6.2 percent of the total, including tip


19

wages of the employee, all right, and they say, we have


20

the power under the statute to assess the amount, and


21

moreover, we think your client didn't pay, and therefore


22

we took what we think was a very reasonable way of


23

figuring that out.


24
25

I'm trying to get you to focus on what I


We looked at the credit cards and we saw it

said, tips, and we saw 14.2 percent is the typical amount,

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and we assume that's it for credit and for cash, and if


2

you don't like that, you prove to the contrary.

think you can prove it, not because it just isn't


4

possible, that probably, in all likelihood, it isn't true,

okay.

9

We don't


Now, that's their point.

Now, you reply to that.

I would like to hear


your argument.

MS. POWER:

My reply to that is, we started out


by saying it's wages, including the tips of the employee,


10

and they did not give us a bill for wages which are the


11

tips of the employee.

12

gross tips of all employees collectively, and this Court


13

has already held that FICA taxes are divisible taxes under


14

Flora v. United States, that it is a tax imposed upon the


15

individual wage earnings.

16

interpreted 3111 to be a tax on individual wage earnings,


17

and they did not give us a bill for that tax.


18

QUESTION:

They gave us a bill for the total


This Court has already


Well, but that's a different argument


19

from the one that we've been wrestling with, which is

22

don't relate to the -- in the same ratio that the credit

15

MS. POWER:

At the end of the evening the

employer would cash out all the employees and would turn

over credit card tips to employees who might have received


18

credit card receipts, and those employees would then


19

decide among themselves to whom in what amount they are


20

going to share those tips that they have received, along


21

with any cash tips that they may have --

reason why the employer should have a strong interest in

employees who do not want the employer to have anything to

It is -- tips are the property of the employee.

it on the total earnings, and it isn't -- your cow analogy


22

didn't just pass me by, because the tax on the employer is


23

independent of the tax on the employee.

24

employees never paid a cent in FICA tax, and they went off


25

to beach-comb some place, the FICA tax would be owed by

MS. POWER:

3

QUESTION:

4

tax belongs to the employer.


5

MS. POWER:

That's correct.

So it's the employer's cow.

The FICA


The -- there is no question that the


6

employer owes a FICA tax.

He owes the FICA tax regardless


7

of whether the employee is ever audited.

8

taxes regardless of whether the employee is ever assessed


9

or the employee ever pays his taxes.

He owes the FICA


It can be assessed


10

against the employer at a completely different time from


11

when it can be assessed against the employee.


12

The employer does not dispute that he owes a FICA


13

tax.

What the employer disputes is, I can't know what I


14

owe that FICA tax on until you make some determination of


15

what the individual earnings are, because until that time,


16

I am denied all defenses employees have that they can


17

raise, and there's a whole list of long --


18

QUESTION:

But you know what -- in fact, you


19

stipulated that you don't dispute the facts, the


20

estimates, or determinations used by the IRS as a basis


21

for its calculation of an amount of aggregated unreported


22

tip income by all directly and indirectly tipped


23

employees, which is your -- is on page 35 of the joint

1

MS. POWER:

I do not -- we do not dispute the


2

amount of the IRS' aggregate assessments because -- of all


3

employees collectively, because we simply do not have the


4

information to dispute that.

5

from having that information.

6

information.

7

Congress for 30 years has told us we do not have to


8

concern ourselves with that information, and we do not


9

have the wherewithal to dispute it.


10

Congress has prohibited us

We do not have that


We have never had that information. 


So in this case, do I dispute that?

No, because


11

it is not worth disputing that or attempting to even


12

whittle down that assessment in this case.


13

QUESTION:

But your position is, we know that


14

there is a disparity between what is reported and what is


15

actually paid in tips.

16

the employer independently owe a tax on that total amount,


17

and we know about the shortfall, but there is nothing the


18

Government can do.

19

put down on the monthly form that they file.


20

MS. POWER:

We know that both the employee and


It's just stuck by what the servers


There's plenty that the Government


21

can do.

22

everything, and that's exactly what Congress says should


23

be done.

The Government has the wherewithal to do

Well, the only thing that you've


proposed, and tell me if I'm wrong about this, is that the

correct in saying that the same method would be used by


3

the Government if it went against an individual server,


4

that it -- you are resisting the Government using against

6

establishment.

7

your tip income, and the way we figured out that you've


8

underreported it is the same formula.

9

goes on when --


10

That is, let's take a waiter in this

The Government says, you've underreported


MS. POWER:

Isn't that what


No, it's entirely different,


11

because -- and as the McQuatters case that's cited in the


12

briefs by both parties illustrates, in that circumstance,


13

the individual waiter has an opportunity to bring any


14

defenses that he has to the Government's assessment


15

forward, and we are denied every possible defense by that


16

scenario.


17

QUESTION:

Well, take -- make that specific,


18

please.

19

have unreported income, and this is how we've estimated


20

it.

21

specifically what does that employee do when the


22

Government says, we've made an estimate based on this 14


23

percent, or whatever it is?


24
25

Here is a waiter, and the Government says, you


We've estimated it based on our formula, and then


MS. POWER:

The employee disputes the estimate. 


Whether he does it at an administrative level or whether

he goes to the tax court and disputes it, he goes in and


2

he disputes it, and he raises the issues, and I think a


3

number of them were identified in the waitresses' amicus


4

brief.

5

long.

6

had.

7

We had a European clientele, the tips weren't as great as


8

you think.


9

For instance, they say, well, I didn't work as

I don't have the same experience as the other guy

They was stiffing, a tremendous amount of stiffing. 


QUESTION:

What is stiffing?


10

MS. POWER:

No tip whatsoever.


11

(Laughter.)


12

MS. POWER:

13

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

I just don't understand how any of


14

that can get you below the amount that shows up on the


15

credit cards, because for example, say one employee got


16

$2,000 in tips, and he could have a defense that I passed


17

out $600 to the busboys, and maybe his liability is less,


18

but it still seems to me the employer would have to at


19

least pay the aggregate amount on the credit card.


20

MS. POWER:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

No, because --

I just don't understand how you get


around that.

MS. POWER:

-- there's a situation where you


24

could have many employees.

There's a very high turnover


25

rate, especially with those who are in the categories that

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

receive the least amount of tips.

2

and he's a busboy and he's there for the afternoon, and he


3

says, boy, forget this job, I'm leaving, and he takes the


4

tips that he gets that day, and that happens at a much


5

higher percentage --


6

QUESTION:

Somebody who comes in,


Well, that would explain why


7

assessments might be wrong as to individual employees, but


8

it still doesn't reduce the gross amount in the tip column


9

on the credit card.


10

MS. POWER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. POWER:

It does reduce the gross amounts --

How?

-- that the employer would have to


13

owe, because if any of that credit card tips that you're


14

assuming isn't in fact a tip was received by somebody who


15

made less than $20 a month, the employer doesn't owe any


16

tax on that.


17

QUESTION:

Okay.

That's a possibility, but


18

wouldn't it suffice on any rule of probability if the


19

Government did just what Justice Stevens described?

20

quite true, yes, there might have been an extraordinary


21

turnover, if there is, the employer can come in and say


22

so.

23

what the credit card reports showed, wouldn't the


24

Government have made an assessment which enjoyed at least


25

a probability of accuracy?


It's


But if the Government made its claim simply based on


39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. POWER:

No, because you go back to 3111 and


2

Congress did not impose a tax on the aggregate earnings of


3

all employees collectively.


4

QUESTION:

So your argument there is that even


5

if you had the perfect evidence, even if there was a memo


6

beyond dispute, written by the accountant and signed by


7

all the employers that said, after the most thorough


8

investigation of this restaurant I'm telling you


9

privately, and you agree, that the total tips earned that


10

are eligible for social security are $350,000, so it's


11

signed by 15 bishops, you know, absolute, dead right,


12

we're saying that even if that's so, he still doesn't owe


13

it because in the memo it doesn't say which employees.


14

MS. POWER:

I think that it needs to say which


15

employees learned which amount, and that's what the tax


16

was imposed upon, and if on the other hand you had all of


17

the employees say yes, I earned this, yes, I earned this,


18

yes, I earned this, then you would have that individual


19

determination.


20

QUESTION:

But there's never been anything held,


21

is there, that where an employer clearly owes a tax to the


22

Government, based because of the earnings of the employee,


23

and there can be different contexts where that comes up,


24

the evidence that he owes that has to name or pick out


25

which employee?

I assume if there were a case that ever

40

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said that you would have cited it, and I doubt that there


2

is.

MS. POWER:

4

QUESTION:

I don't think that there is.

All right.

If there isn't, then


5

that's my problem.

6

the evidence, you run into the problem that Justices


7

Stevens and Souter mentioned.

8

need for the precision identification of a single


9

employee, I don't see in the law any requirement for such


10

If you're talking about the quality of


If you're talking about the


a principle.


11

MS. POWER:

I think that it's in 3111.

I think


12

that this Court has already held that the tax is imposed


13

upon --


14

QUESTION:

But whereabouts in 3111?

If it's


15

just two sentences, tell us what sentence or what clause


16

you --

18

MS. POWER:

Well, 3111, it says wages or -- 3111


says wages -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.


19

Equal to the following percentage of wages as


20

defined in section 3121(a), the tax imposed on something


21

called wages, that is defined in 3121(a).

MS. POWER:

Okay, well, the 21 exceptions to

22

employee has a 401(k) plan, the extent to which an

But that was just about whether or

not the tax court had jurisdiction if the assessment

MS. POWER:

Yes, but I believe that footnote 37


8

in that brief, in that opinion said that the Court agreed

that the excise tax, like a FICA tax, is a divisible tax. 


10

That's the whole basis upon which we're here.

Now, Congress passed something called

the TRAC law in 1998 to deal with this very problem of

I thought there was a section in 1998

It acknowledged that the agreement

QUESTION:

Do you think Congress was assuming


15

there were assessments going on of employers for this


16

liability?


17

MS. POWER:

Not at that time, because there are


18

two documents at the very end of the joint appendix that


19

are Government documents, and they indicate that they were


20

not doing the employer-only assessments at that time.

21

fact, they indicate that they were not doing the employer-

that they -- they assured Congress that they were not

I would say that they started doing

them about 1992, 1993, and you had asked the question


4

earlier, how many TRAC agreements are there that have been


5

signed.

6

have been signed.

7

There are about 25-to-30,000 TRAC agreements that

There are about 200,000 --


QUESTION:

Well, this congressional provision


8

that I asked you about was made in 1998, so that was well


9

after the beginning of aggregate assessments.


10
11
12

MS. POWER:

And long after the IRS had announced


that they were not doing aggregate assessments.

QUESTION:

The gravamen of your brief is that as


13

a principle an assessment shouldn't be imposed on the


14

taxpayer unless the taxpayer has the information to


15

contradict the assessment, which certainly makes a lot of


16

common sense.

17

something that we've said in the cases that sustains that


18

overarching principle?


Is there a provision in the code, or


19

MS. POWER:

20

MS. POWER:

25

Or is it just kind of a due process


fairness thing?


22

24

Well, I think that --


Well --

Is there a specific principle you can


point to to show the correctness of that assumption?

MS. POWER:

Well, I think that there's 30 years

46

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of congressional history that clearly shows that Congress


2

does not intend for the employer to be put in this


3

position, that Congress did not intend for the employer to


4

be required to police and monitor the reporting of


5

employees, and ostensibly that's what the IRS'


6

interpretation does.


7

QUESTION:

But you have no specific authority or


8

precedent for the proposition that an assessment should


9

not be imposed on a taxpayer unless the taxpayer is in a


10

good or perhaps best position to contradict the


11

assessment?


12

MS. POWER:

I think that we have plenty of


13

authority for the proposition that the assessment in this


14

case is unauthorized because it's on the collective wage-


15

earning on 31 --


16
17

QUESTION:

But that wasn't what I asked you. 
 I

asked you about the general proposition.


18

MS. POWER:

19

QUESTION:

That a tax cannot be imposed upon --

An assessment cannot be imposed on


20

the taxpayer unless the taxpayer has the capacity or the


21

ability to contradict it.

22

me that's the principle argument in your brief.

23

a lot of sense, but I want to know if I'm -- if the


24

Court's writing an opinion for that, what do they cite for


25

that proposition?


I mean, that's -- it seems to

It makes

MS. POWER:

2

QUESTION:

The best I can tell you --

Other than the fact that this is


3

something everybody should know, but that doesn't usually


4

work.


5

(Laughter.)


6

MS. POWER:

I think that the burden of


7

presumption and the burden of proof that they have put


8

forth is premised upon the understanding that the person


9

with that burden has the records and is in the best


10

position to respond, and that does not characterize this


11

situation, so those policy considerations behind that are


12

not existing here.


13

QUESTION:

Are there other situations in the tax


14

law where the Government knows that income has been


15

underreported?

16

contexts where the taxpayer doesn't keep reliable records,


17

and so the Government has to find some way of measuring


18

what the tax should be, so it does an estimate?

19

that common?


20

Aren't estimates made in many different

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

asked you, are they making an estimate in that case, and

you started to say no, because the taxpayer, the

individual servers have all these --

MS. POWER:

QUESTION:

6

MS. POWER:

7

QUESTION:

Excuses --

Yes.

-- or defenses?

Yes.

a single waiter, that they can have an estimate.


10

MS. POWER:

12

MS. POWER:

13

QUESTION:

14

They can.

They do make an estimate.

They can.

And the very estimate that you are


resisting when it applies to the employer.


15

MS. POWER:

Because we are -- we don't have the


16

same defenses that the waiter and the waitress does.

17

waiter and the waitress can say, you know, all kinds of


18

things in response, that no, I didn't earn that, here are


19

my records, here are my individual records of exactly what


20

I earned.


21

The


The IRS sends them a bill based on the same


22

types of estimates, takes it one step further and says,


23

okay, well, you worked X number of hours out of the total


24

number of hours in this restaurant, so of this total share


25

we think your share is this amount.

The waiter or


49
Alderson Reporting Company

waitress can come in and say no, here's my individual


2

record, and this is exactly what I earned, or no, you're


3

wrong in assuming this, or you're wrong in assuming that,


4

and then a determination can be made of what that


5

individual waiter or waitress made, and then turn around


6

and give it to us.


7

That's exactly what one of the documents in our


8

joint appendix on page 92, that's exactly what the IRS did


9

do before they came up with this aggregate assessment


10

method, because that is precisely what Congress envisioned


11

that the IRS would be doing with the 8027 Form data, is


12

taking that information, using that information to make


13

examinations of individual employees, and then turning


14

around --


15

QUESTION:

Now, practically can the IRS -- are


16

you suggesting that they go after the employees, and then


17

when they know the amount based on the extra tax the


18

employee will have to pay, then say, okay, employer, you

pay the same amount, but practically can the IRS -- does


20

it have the facilities to go audit every waiter and busboy

that's a discrete tax.

There's a tax on the employee. 


15

That's a discrete tax.

Why, because the Government is

going to have a hard time collecting the tax on the

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

QUESTION:

Ms. O'Connor, at the very outset you

said that 311 imposed a tax on wages paid or deemed to

have been paid.

Is the word deemed in the statute?


MS. O'CONNOR:

MS. O'CONNOR:

Is the word deemed in the


Yes.

I believe so.

I believe it's in


3121(q), Your Honor, which I keep losing.


9

QUESTION:

10

Well, I'll find it.


MS. O'CONNOR:

Yes, it's on page 58a, is where


11

3121(q) appears, and remember that is a section that


12

provides definitions.

13

tips which are paid or deemed to have been paid, and


14

3121(q) also tells you the time.


15

3121 tells you that wages include


As we have said, this is a tax on an aggregate


16

amount.

17

employer reports the tax, and shows that it is a tax on


18

the wages paid.

Form 941 in your joint appendix show how the


QUESTION:

Well, except I think the deeming


20

refers to the time of payment, not to the fact of payment,


21

but I'll look at that.


22

MS. O'CONNOR:

I think you're right about that,


23

Your Honor.

Nonetheless, they are deemed to be paid at


24

the time, right.

That's the very first sentence.

QUESTION:

It does


It's at page 85a.


How long has IRS been making these


assessments, please, Ms. O'Connor?

They're deemed to have been paid by the


MS. O'CONNOR:

I believe, Justice O'Connor, that


it did start around 1992 and 1993, and the information


10

that the IRS is gathering on the forms 8027 demonstrated


11

the extent of the problem that Congress suspected did


12

exist about substantial underreporting of tip income.


13

QUESTION:

In view of all the questions about


14

the proper computation, why has the Government resisted


15

notice and comment rulemaking to come up with a fair


16

formula, because the contention is that the Government's


17

formula exaggerates the income, exaggerates the tip


18

income.


19

MS. O'CONNOR:

That is certainly the contention,


20

and there have been, however, no facts to show whether


21

that's true or not, because in each of the cases, not only


22

the Ninth Circuit below, but in each of the three cases


23

that we cite in our briefs decided by the Seventh,


24

Eleventh, and the Federal Circuits, no evidence was ever


25

submitted to show that the tips were overstated in any
