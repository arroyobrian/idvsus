ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. BYRNE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BYRNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case presents one of the most

11

confounding questions of bankruptcy law, and that is the

12

meaning of defalcation, which is found currently in

13

Section 523(a)(4) of the Code.

14

in a Bankruptcy Code with more than 100 defined terms

15

and it has been in the Bankruptcy Code -- Bankruptcy

16

Act, excuse me, since 1841 and in every version of it

17

since then.

18

meaning that we can resort to, with respect to

19

interpretation of the word because it is not in common

20

use.

It is an undefined term

There is no plain contemporary, ordinary

21

This case presents both the question of the

22

action required to establish defalcation and the mental

23

state that most -- that must accompany it.

24

mental state issue, the circuits have split in probably

25

three ways, at least.

Alderson Reporting Company

And on the

Official

The Eleventh Circuit here held that 


1
2

Petitioner committed defalcation by acting recklessly 


3

and affirmed on summary judgment -- a summary judgment 


4

order that was granted for the petitioning creditor. 


5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, before we get to the

6

various candidates for applicable mental state, if there

7

is one, could you tell me what this mental state applies

8

to?

9

Does it apply to facts or does it apply to law?
MR. BYRNE:

Your Honor, it should apply to

10

both, but it applies -- the act must be accompanied by a

11

culpable mental state.

12

argued that mistake of law can be relevant to the

13

knowledge that the actor has when he commits the act,

14

and we have argued that in this particular circumstance

15

particularly involving dischargeability, that a mistake

16

of law ought to be permissible in responding to the

17

claim of defalcation.

18

We will argue that -- and have

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what we have here

19

is, I think everybody agrees, that these transactions

20

were not authorized and they were self-dealing to the

21

extent that there was a benefit to Mr. Bullock from the

22

investments that were made.

23

being unauthorized and self-dealing, which the

24

government tells us should be enough to make

25

defalcation, what else other than that it was not

So what, in addition to

4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

authorized and it was self-dealing?

2

MR. BYRNE:

Your Honor, we believe that a

3

showing of extreme recklessness at least is required as

4

to the self-dealing, and so we have advocated for the

5

First and Second Circuit standard, which requires either

6

extreme recklessness or conscious misbehavior by the

7

actor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is a trustee who is

taking -- borrowing against the cash value of the life

10

insurance making an investment for the benefit of

11

himself and his mother getting profit from that

12

investment and not sharing it with the other siblings

13

who are also.

14

all advertently.

15

So what more than -- I mean, he did that

MR. BYRNE:

Well, Your Honor, let me go back

16

to the question, first were -- were the loans

17

authorized?

18

defalcation here is based entirely on the two Illinois

19

court orders in collateral estoppel.

20

courts specifically reserved the question of whether the

21

loans were authorized.

22

please, and answer your second question.

23

Now, this case -- the finding of

And the Illinois

But let me put that aside,

And what -- what sets this case apart and

24

what -- what at least creates a factual question on

25

whether Mr. Bullock committed defalcation was what was

1

his -- what was the overall transaction.

2

family trust, it was created by his father, involving

3

his father's life insurance policy.

4

uncontradicted evidence that he did not know that making

5

a loan to his mother at his father's request would

6

somehow run afoul of the law more than a decade later

7

when this all came -- when this all came to court.

8
9

This is a

There is

So we say, Your Honor, that there is at
least a factual question that would have entitled him --

10

should have entitled him to a trial on the question of

11

the mental state that accompanied his actions.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what about the two

13

other transactions which were not done at the bidding of

14

the father?

15

MR. BYRNE:

Well, Your Honor, they were done

16

at the bidding of the mother and also they were -- they

17

went into the family business.

18

went into the business created by the father and the

19

mother, the garage building business.

preferences of the others were.

He knew it.

Now, what he didn't know was that that was

unlawful.

16

things, embezzlement, larceny, fraud in the trust, I

don't think any of them require a knowledge that what

18

you're doing is unlawful.

1

and so -- if I do what Justice Harlan was doing and

2

comparing it to the other three, it looks as if you

3

don't need to know that what you're doing is against the

4

law, where you commit defalcation.

5

Now, that I think is what Justice Alito was

6

driving at.

7

answer on that.

8
9

And I'd like to hear an absolutely clear

MR. BYRNE:

Your Honor, let me -- let me

try -- let me try to give such an answer.

The first,

10

with respect to larceny, embezzlement and fraud, a

11

mistake of law is admissible where it negates the

12

scienter or the mental state.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I didn't think there's

14

any respect here in which admissing -- mistake of law,

15

would negate the mental state as to having taken money

16

from the trust, used it in the family business and then

17

paid it back, which I take it are, we assume, which is a

18

different question I have, but for present purposes, we

19

are assuming that that's sufficient for defalcation.

20
21
22

Is that right?

Where does it, where does

it negative the intent in respect to what happened?
MR. BYRNE:

Well, Your Honor, the knowledge

23

of the law, knowledge of wrongdoing I think is what --

24

what you're asking, where does that come into this?

25

it comes into the question A, if you didn't have it; and
9

Alderson Reporting Company

And

1

B, the question becomes was it extremely reckless under 


2

the scienter standard that the First and Second 


3

Circuits -- the First and Second Circuits follow --


4

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it had nothing to do 


5

with recklessness.

6

That is a stronger mental state than recklessness, not a

7

weaker one.

8
9
10

He did these three things knowingly.

MR. BYRNE:

Well, Your Honor, but he did then

without knowing that they -JUSTICE BREYER:

Were unlawful.

So we're

11

back at the same question, and I'm now assuming you have

12

no answer to the question because there is none.

13

MR. BYRNE:

Well, Your Honor, the -- in many

14

instances, not many, but in some instances, the Court

15

has held that not knowing that a practice is unlawful is

16

a defense to a charge of the crime.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

My problem is the

18

following, which is let's assume he had taken the money

19

and lost it and he never repaid it.

20

whether he thought he could take the money or not?

21

thought the very basic definition of defalcation in

22

every dictionary of the time and forever, one of the

23

three definitions has always been that you cause a loss

24

to the -- to the trust.

25

all, is my bottom line?

What does it matter
I

Why does mental state matter at

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I think that your stronger argument is that

2

loss to the estate, or the one that you have to -- can

3

direct your attention to, is what is the loss to the

4

trust?

5

lose it or not if I wasn't entitled to lose it? 


6

But what does it matter whether I intended to

MR. BYRNE:

Well, Your Honor, the question 


7

would be whether or not on the mental state and I'll


8

get to the actus reus element of this quickly, but 


9

as to the mental state, if the mental state is not 


10

culpable, then it seems entirely inconsistent --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's Justice

12

Breyer's point, which is if you took the money and lost

13

it, what does it matter?

14

you were drugged and didn't know that you were taking

15

the money and somebody else forced you to in some --

16

under some sort of duress defense, some outrageous

17

question, isn't the issue the one that Justice Breyer

18

came to?

19

ignorance of the law ever save you when you are required

20

to exercise the highest protection of the trust?

21

You took it.

If you're a fiduciary, why should an excuse of

MR. BYRNE:

Well, Your Honor, of course, it

22

does not save you from liability.

23

dischargeability, which is a --

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

Because --- with its concomitant

You intended to take the money.

MR. BYRNE:

Well, Your Honor, because for

6

dischargeability purposes, because of Gleason v. Thaw,

7

and the rule that -- that bankruptcy discharge

8

exceptions are confined to those plainly expressed

9

doubts are resolved in favor of the debtor.

And if you

10

look at the other requirements for exceptions to

11

discharge in Section 523(a) you see a high level of

12

culpable conduct.

13

that reckless torts do not amount --

14

For example, in Geiger the Court held

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but you see -- should

15

I have to write the opinion in this case, I would have

16

to deal with this issue and I'd have to say something

17

about it.

18

those are words like "embezzlement," "larceny," and

19

"fraud."

20

are crimes ignorance of the law is not an excuse.

21

often is an excuse where in fact it's a tax violation or

22

some other technical violation.

23

words which never have ignorance of the law as an excuse

2

and meant them differently.

3

hard to say.

4

MR. BYRNE:

Each of those is pretty

Well, Your Honor, you're

5

exception to the general rule, was found to be a defense

complex legal regime.

10

And what you had in those cases was a
You had the tax laws and then you

had the -- anti-structuring statute.

11

And here, we say that trust law in and of

12

itself is a complex enough legal regime that a mistake

13

of law at least ought to be admissible, not for

14

liability, but for establishing bankruptcy --

18

has defalcated shows up in Rio with two suitcases full

19

of money, and it seems to me if you look at the root of

20

the word, it consists of diminishing, taking a sickle

21

and cutting something down, and therefore it did seem to

22

refer to an instance where you take the corpus or money

23

belonging to the trust, now it becomes ambiguous, and

24

you run off with it.

25

I think of defalcation as the individual who

Is there anything you would like to say
13

Alderson Reporting Company

1

about that?

2

MR. BYRNE:

Yes, Your Honor.

I would like

3

to say that defalcation requires a shortage in accounts

4

at the end of the day.

5

a trust, there must be some res missing when the trustee

6

is called to account.

7

And so there must be -- if it's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But there is a

8

shortage of accounts at the end of the day.

9

question of what day it is.

It's just a

When he takes -- takes the

10

stuff and it's a lost -- it's either viewed as a lost

11

opportunity or an increase in the risk to the

12

beneficiary, and that's a loss to them at that point.

13

The fact -- it's like a bank robber giving back the

14

money.

15

a crime.

16

There is no loss to the bank, but it's still

MR. BYRNE:

Well, Your Honor, the deletion

17

of the word "misappropriation" in 1978 from the

18

Bankruptcy Code by Congress suggests that

19

misappropriations that are on an interim basis that

20

cause -- that do not cause a loss to the trust and

21

are -- are never accounted for is not the kind of action

22

or act that should result in an exception to discharge.

23

But if you look with respect to defalcation

24

at the definitions at the time, the definitions that

25

were available in 1841 as I believe Justice Breyer has
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

done, the -- the definitions you get are, for example in

2

Webster's 1828 dictionary, the act of cutting off or

3

deducting a part.

4

And the origin of the defalcation exception,

5

and I believe the amici for Respondent are correct in

6

this respect, was the Swartwout scandal in 1838, when

7

one Samuel Swartwout, who was the -- in charge of

8

collections for the New York Customs House, which was a

9

substantial part of the Federal budget at that time, was

10

found after he departed the country to have $1.2 million

11

missing from his accounts.

12

a defalcation at the time and it's quite reasonable to

13

assume that's how it ended up in the statute.

14

And that was referred to as

So the loss of res there -- the loss of

15

funds to which the fiduciary is responsible for

16

collecting at the time of -- that he turns over his

17

office because this really originated with public

18

officials, is the relevant time.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I guess the question is

20

how do you measure this loss?

21

away and then you give it back, or even if you give it

22

back with 2 percent interest or something, I mean, maybe

23

if that money had remained in the trust and I realize

24

that this is a strange trust, but we have to think about

25

other kinds of trusts, if that money had remained in the

I mean, if you take money

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

trust, there would have been a profit to be made from

2

that money.

3

And -- you know, it's not -- if you say,

4

well, I gave it back, well, yes, but if you had just

5

left it there, you would have had that money plus all

6

the money that that money earned.

7

MR. BYRNE:

Correct, Justice Kagan.

But

8

here, there was never any money taken from the trust

9

that didn't wind up with the trust at the end of the

10

day.

11

day Mr. Bullock unwittingly became a trustee in 1978 was

12

the same as when he, at the end of his tenure --

13

The evidence is that the net policy value on the

made?

16

in addition to that, according to the Illinois court's

17

judgment, there was a profit that he made that he didn't

18

put back in the trust -- he didn't put in the trust.

19

Yes, he paid back everything with interest, but

MR. BYRNE:

He was -- he was charged with

20

having profited with respect to one or more of the

loans, Your Honor.

6

May I ask you a question

that is not a technical bankruptcy question, but he --

12

this judgment debt, this Illinois judgment debt, right?

14

MR. BYRNE:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
And the Eleventh Circuit

16

said -- you know, we're really sympathetic to that, but

17

the problem is that the bank would not let you sell the

18

collateral.

19

could pay off the loan and you wouldn't need to declare

20

bankruptcy.

21

If you could sell the collateral, then you

Did you bring such a suit, the suit that

Counsel, give me your

best answer to the rule that we should write, okay?

Forgetting that I don't accept that you need a mental

12

state, okay?

13

Let's go to just the loss issue.

If I agree with you that you need to prove

14

the loss, this is a very unusual trust because the

15

measure of what the trust's res should be is fixed.

16

was the amount of the trust plus the fixed interest,

17

essentially.

18

norm, the trust just says to the trustee invest

prudently.

takes the profit.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Assume that that is

3

distasteful because for all the reasons the government

argues in its amicus brief, the idea that a trustee

5

could self-deal is the height of a breach of fiduciary

6

duty.

7

So give me something that -- that would win

8

your case without upsetting the fact that defalcation

somehow should, in the norm, include something as

10

egregious as self-dealing.

because he didn't know, but let's assume the worst case,

12

the guy knew.

13

MR. BYRNE:

You don't think your guy did

Well, for the -- for that worst

14

case, Your Honor, there is embezzlement in the statute.

15

So if a -- if someone comes into possession of property

16

and misuses it and does so with fraudulent intent, it

17

sounds like here, then there is a -- then embezzlement

can be established under the statute.

The only -- the only agenda potentially left

for Petitioner would be litigation in the -- in the

Illinois courts against the trustee to create some sort

of a judgment that might be used in some way to

ameliorate the effect of the bankruptcy court's

version of the Bankruptcy Act is set up.

In the past however, in Neal v. Clark, in an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BILL D. BENSINGER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BENSINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

reckless breach of his fiduciary duty of loyalty and was

therefore a defalcation.

Was there a finding of

recklessness in the State court?
MR. BENSINGER:

No, Your Honor.

There was

not a finding of recklessness.

14

found that the debtor engaged in self-dealing.

15

used trust assets for his own purposes and, thereby,

16

created a split, a conflict of interest between his

17

interest and the interest of the trust.

18

The State court simply
That he

The moment that he made those loans, there

19

is an absolute certainty that there would be a conflict

20

of interest and a reasonable person -- a reasonable

21

trustee in the Petitioner's position would not have made

22

those loans because the risk was so high, nigh on an

23

absolute certainly, that there would be this conflict of

24

interest, and that is when the harm occurred at the

25

moment he made the loans, Your Honor.

4

MR. BENSINGER:

Or do you

Generally speaking, Your

5

Honor, embezzlement does require some sort of specific

6

mental intent, an intent to deceive or to defraud.

7

defalcation does not require that same mental intent and

that's borne out by the history.

Thus Justice Kennedy's basic question I'd

it, that there has to be an element in which the person

18

not only knows what he has done, but that he does it

19

with an element of moral turpitude; i.e. he knows that

20

the law forbids it or -- or are you conceding this and

then fill in the blanks, or?

defalcation does not.

definition would seem to be more likely to be thought

innocent by someone who commits it in some circumstances

than would fraud.

MR. BENSINGER:

Your Honor, defalcation must

21

mean something other than fraud.

Petitioner had every opportunity to bring those facts

into -- into evidence at the bankruptcy court and he did

both sides with regard to this issue, why the trust

debt, and if there is no debt, then there is nothing for

Specifically, if the mental intent required were an

And it -- it seems to me that you're

standing very firm on the fact that defalcation means

3

something different than fraud in the first clause, or

4

embezzlement and larceny in -- in the following clause.

5

MR. BENSINGER:

It does, Your Honor.

6

Defalcation when it was first introduced into the

7

Bankruptcy Act in 1841 had a known meaning, and that

8

known meaning, at least according to the Oxford English

9

Dictionary, is a monetary deficiency through breach of

10

trust.

11

That was when the --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the problem is, as

13

the -- your friend on the other side points out, that

14

there's two problems with this.

15

consistent with these -- with the meaning of the other

16

three terms in the -- in the statute; and two, it's not

17

consistent with the idea that discharges should be

18

freely given so that debtors can begin again.

19

MR. BENSINGER:

Number one, it's not

But, Your Honor, the

20

subsequent inclusion of the terms fraud, embezzlement

21

and larceny cannot retroactively modify or change the

22

known definition of the word defalcation.

23

Schwager v. Northern Burlington considered two sections

24

of -- or two statutes in the Securities and Exchange

25

Act, Section 14(e) and Section 10(b).

Section 14(e) was

Both statutes prohibited a manipulative type

4

of transaction with regard to securities.

that the inclusion of the term "fraudulent" in Section

Section 14(e)

This Court stated in that case -- while it

And the same logic applies here.

The

12

subsequent inclusion of the terms "fraudulent" and

"embezzlement" and "larceny" cannot modify the known

14

meaning, even if that known meaning has been lost, the

15

meaning of the word "defalcation."

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

you correctly, you said that the definition was a

monetary deficiency arising from a breach of trust.

monetary loss at that time.

that meaning.

12

either a monetary deficiency through a breach of trust

13

by one who has the management or charge of funds --

14

And my friend quoted it earlier, there is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, monetary deficiency,

15

again, isn't that a loss?

16

position was that there didn't need to be a loss.

17

MR. GANNON:

But I thought that your

Well, there are two questions

18

there and I think that one of the illustrative

19

quotations that the OED uses for that very definition

20

doesn't actually refer to a monetary deficiency, and

21

neither do most of the other dictionary definitions.

22

I do think that there's probably an open question about

23

what the purest meaning of the term defalcation, whether

24

it requires a loss.

25

Here, we do think that there is a loss.
43

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

There is a loss in a very real and traditional sense.

2

There is no doubt about it that because the Petitioner

3

took -- engaged in self-dealing and made a profit with

4

that, with the money that he had taken out of the trust

5

corpus and refused to return those profits to the trust,

6

that is a loss to the trust, just as it would be had he

taken the money and invested it in some great investment

scheme and -- or he decided to bet it at the track --

9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's certainly

true --

11

MR. GANNON:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- and he decided --- in an ordinary trust, but

13

isn't there a real question as to this trust because if

this trust would -- the trustee shouldn't have been

17

MR. GANNON:

All that this trust

I don't think that's a fair

statement of the way this trust operates.

19

consistent with Petitioner's own arguments.

20

Petitioner's argument in the State court and in the

21

Bankruptcy Court, the argument that he says is the

22

reason why there is no -- no determination about whether

11

position that the only thing that could ever be in the

12

trust was the life insurance policy plus 6 percent.

But I don't think anybody has taken the

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

That's what I

So you're saying that that is not the case?
MR. GANNON:

I believe that that is not the

16

case and that is not even consistent with Petitioner's

17

own position in the State court, where he said he was

18

taking this money and investing it in some alternative

19

thing because he thought that would be safer than

20

leaving the money with the life insurance company.

21

And I think if I can go back to explaining

22

why I think that this is a loss and so I think that this

5

he had a tip at the races and he was going to go down to

And he decided, well, you know what, had I

money that it would have earned in interest vis--vis

the insurance company, my position, the government's

10

position, is that the loss here is that he failed to

assets of the trust corpus.

Now, the other argument was, yes, fine, a

state of mind because he didn't understand the law. 


4

Justice Kennedy quoted, fraud -- from this Court, that 


5

fraud in bankruptcy for purposes of this provision

6

requires some degree of moral turpitude.

7

suggests that you aren't innocent in respect to

8

knowledge that it's against the law.

9

MR. GANNON:

Well, that

What about that?

My response to that is that the

10

Neal v. Clark decision that's being discussed here is --

11

and we discuss this in our brief -- is distinguishable

12

in part because its current descendent is actually not

13

this provision.

14

is the exception from discharge in paragraph (a)(2)(A).

It is not this reference to fraud.

It

15

And what makes this different is that this

16

is fraud in a fiduciary capacity which was not true in

17

the context of Neal v. Clark, and that's something that

18

the Court said at the time, that because it did not

19

actually have the limitations of the fiduciary context,

20

they needed to infer some type of limitation.

21

inferred it, the Court inferred it, from embezzlement.

22

They

And so going back to Justice Kennedy's

23

question, the way Congress has dealt with that is that

24

it has put actual fraud in (a)(2)(A), and here it has

25

grouped fraud with defalcation in a fiduciary capacity
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and therefore it includes the type of limitation that 


2

the Court was trying to impose in Neal v. Clark. 


3
4
5

We don't think that there is any inherent 

mens rea in defalcation and --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you explain what you

6

mean, before your time expires, in footnote 18?

7

understood your argument until I got there, but then you

8

said that there was no particular mental state required.

9

And then in footnote 18 you said, well, there may be

10
11

I

cases where a particular mental state is required.
MR. GANNON:

Well, I think when it gets

12

further away from the heartland definition of

13

defalcation, which does -- which, as we discussed in

14

this Court's 1844 decision in Chapman and in the 1841

15

bankruptcy law, the defalcation was equated with

16

self-dealing in trust assets.

17

the heart of defalcation.

18

And so we think that's

As you move away from that particular type

19

of fiduciary breach, and if you move away from there it

20

may become more relevant whether there is --

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Where are courts supposed to

22

look to find out what is the border between the

23

heartland of defalcation and the badlands of defalcation

24

and whatever else?

25

MR. GANNON:

Well, to be fair, the
49


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dictionary definitions are broad enough to include other

2

types of fiduciary breaches, but it's not clear that

3

that means that defalcation needs to be doing all the

4

work here of potentially putting limits on the scope of

5

the exception.

6

And so if you look at the Ninth Circuit, for

7

instance, the way it has handled this is it has

8

recognized, as we do, that defalcation can be innocent

9

and -- but it has, it has concluded that the essence of

10

defalcation is the failure to account for or to produce

11

funds, and therefore it wouldn't be something that would

12

just be garden variety mismanagement of the assets.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why not?

I mean,

14

it's a -- it's a violation of the trustee's

15

responsibility when he makes a negligent investment of

16

the funds, right?

17
18

And so he doesn't turn over as much money as
should be turned over.

19

MR. GANNON:

It's a defalcation.
Well, we certainly do think

20

that that may well be the ultimate answer.

21

that would be further away from the core of defalcation,

22

but it's not this case, so we would urge the Court to

23

affirm.

19

MR. BYRNE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

20

Now, to respond to a few things said by Respondent and

21

by the solicitor, the Petitioner actually did put into

22

the record when he opposed summary judgment pro se in

23

the bankruptcy court all of his evidence about what

24

he -- what should have been done with the money that was

25

in the constructive trust, what should have been done
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with the property that was in the constructive trust

2

during that period.

3

He put that in -- in evidence, it's in the

4

record and his repeated pleas that the assets be sold to

5

pay the judgment are reflected by that.

6

The Respondent relied entirely on the two

7

Illinois court orders and put in no evidence other than

8

the original pleadings, if they are evidence, in the --

9

in the Illinois case.

So there is that question about

10

the record, and Petitioner did track what -- what his

11

efforts were to try to persuade the trustee to consent

12

to the sale of the property.

13

And it's interesting, the constructive

14

trust, of course, was imposed on the properties that

15

were acquired with loans two and three.
