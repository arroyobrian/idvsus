Mr. Katyal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
ERISA permits plan fiduciaries to seek

10
11

appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the

12

plan.

13

Six years ago, this Court, in Sereboff,

14

concluded that reimbursement actions by ERISA plans,

15

such as the one at issue here, seek equitable liens by

16

agreement.

17

an equitable lien by agreement, that means one parcel of

18

equitable defenses, those derived from unjustment

19

enrichment, offer no help to Respondents.

20
21
22

And because the plan's claim here is one for

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Katyal, if you go to

equity, why aren't you bound by equity?
MR. KATYAL:

We certainly are, Justice

23

Sotomayor, bound by equity.

Our contention is not that,

24

once you say the magic words "equitable lien by

25

agreement," that somehow transforms into a "we win" as
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiffs at all.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but that's exactly

3

what your bottom line is, which is you have someone else

4

do the work for you and you don't pay them.

5

MR. KATYAL:

Quite to the contrary, Justice

6

Sotomayor, our position is that the rules of equity bind

7

equitable liens by agreement, just as they bind anything

8

else.

9

doesn't apply --

We're not trying to say that the equity

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

So why does your lien

11

have priority to the attorney's lien that is normally

12

created at the commencement of the litigation?

13

the attorney bound by the agreement you signed with the

14

beneficiary?

15

MR. KATYAL:

Why is

So our position is that the

16

attorney doesn't -- there is no lien created with the

17

attorney; that, once Mr. Sereboff signed -- entered into

18

an agreement with US Air, that agreement said --

19

provided for 100 percent reimbursement rights.

20

And there is no -- essentially, what

21

happened is Mr. Sereboff -- excuse me -- Mr. -- Mr.

22

McCutchen double-promised his money.

23

first to -- first to the US Airways plan, and then he

24

promised it to -- to his attorneys.

25

He promised it

And that's a problem that he might have with
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

his attorneys, although, as I understand the facts here,

2

maybe that debt has been forgiven, but it is not

3

something that creates an independent lien on the money

4

that's at issue here.

5

That is, the rules in equity say that it is

6

the agreement that controls -- when we're talking about

7

an -- when we're talking about an equitable lien by

8

agreement --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

With Sereboff, that

10

you -- you referred to, that -- that certainly describes

11

the lien you rely on, but there's a footnote toward the

12

end that leaves open the make-whole doctrine and, I

13

assume, also the common fund doctrine, so -- so it's --

14

it's an open question.
MR. KATYAL:

15

Right.

So our position is not

16

that Sereboff's letter controls this case.

17

the reasoning of Sereboff essentially does decide the

18

question because what Sereboff said, Justice Ginsburg --

19

and this is at page 368 of the opinion in the text -- it

20

said -- the Sereboffs had argued the make-whole

21

doctrine.

22

We do think

And the -- in response, what this Court said

23

is, quote, "Mid Atlantic's claim is not considered

24

equitable because it is a subrogation claim.

25

Mid Atlantic's action qualifies as an equitable remedy
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because it is indistinguishable from an action to

2

enforce an equitable lien established by agreement of

3

the sort epitomized by our decision in Barnes.

4

Mid Atlantic need not characterize its action as a

5

freestanding action for equitable subrogation.

6

Accordingly, the parcel of equitable defenses the

7

Sereboffs claim accompany any such action are beside the

8

point."

9

Beside the point.
And our position is, once the Court has

10

decided that the type of action that is at issue here is

11

an equitable lien by agreement, the relevant doctrine --

12

and this is a further answer to you, Justice Sotomayor --

13

that the Court is to look to is how are equitable liens

14

by agreement evaluated in equity?

15

And those rules in equity say that, again,

16

the general rules of equity apply and govern that; but

17

the one place -- the one set of defenses that aren't

18

governed, are those that sound an unjust enrichment.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I recognize that

20

we're talking about a matter of Federal law here.

21

about the law of most of the States?

22

What

Suppose there's an agreement with an insurer

23

and an insured, that says the insured gets 100 percent

24

of the proceeds.

25

States gives a superior lien to the attorney for the

I would think that the law of most

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contingent fee, notwithstanding the agreement.

2

I'm not sure of that.

3

It's just an

assumption.

4

MR. KATYAL:

That -- that is true, in some

5

subrogation States.

However, even with respect to that,

6

when you have -- as long as it's not abrogated by

7

statute or something like that.

8

an agreement by an insured and it provides for 100

9

percent reimbursement and abrogation of the common fund,

But if you simply have

10

even there, Justice Kennedy, the -- the agreement is

11

enforced.

12

So State Farm v. Clinton, which is a case

13

cited in our brief, as long as -- as well as the Dobbs

14

case and other decisions -- the Arkansas Supreme Court

15

in 1969, the Arkansas court in 1931 -- have all said

16

that, if you have an insurance agreement that abrogates

17

the common fund doctrine, that that agreement is

18

enforced.

19

And, here, of course, we're dealing --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where is that

21

abrogation -- where is that abrogation in this -- not

22

the plan description, but the plan itself -- what clear

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm asking about the plan

16

discrepancy.

17

MR. KATYAL:

Exactly.

And so the plan

18

itself was submitted, I believe, a few days ago.

19

Respondents have now made an issue of it.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

And I -- and I

21

don't -- you -- you make a distinction between

22

reimbursement clause and the subrogation clause.

23

this -- as far as I can tell from the plan, is no

24

reimbursement clause.

25

The only one that's there is labeled

I don't see language that clearly abrogates the common

MR. KATYAL:

Your Honor, I suppose that --

5

that they could have made this an issue when they

6

7

didn't.

8

They

And, indeed, there was discovery -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I mean, you -- you

9

want us to decide a case without looking at the plan?

10

I have before me the same language that I

11

believe Justice Ginsburg is looking at, and I think

12

she's quite correct, that the word "abrogation," of

13

course, is not used, but neither is the concept.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't think we took this

15

case to review the plan.

Is -- is that what the Supreme

16

Court took the case for, to say what this particular

17

individual plan said?

18

MR. KATYAL:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.
Had that -- had that point

been raised, we would not have taken the case.
MR. KATYAL:

And much to the -- and much to

22

the contrary, Justice Scalia, exactly, this is the way

23

that they framed the brief in opposition.

24

presented is this:

25

beneficiary must reimburse his ERISA plan for

The question

"Whether a seriously injured ERISA

10

2

plan language so provides."

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, "simply because the

4

plan language."

5

the plan language to see what the -- you're -- you're

6

relying on the plan language.

7

but you don't cite the main plan.

8
9

I mean, obviously, we have to look at

MR. KATYAL:

And you cite the summary,

Two things, Justice Kennedy.

First, that brief in opposition goes on to say that that

10

plan was clear with respect to the common fund doctrine

11

and others at page 5.

12

But, second, if you're concerned --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

conceding --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17
18
19
20

Counsel, are you

I'm sorry.

Maybe --

-- the plan doesn't say

it?
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me, please.

The

second point?
MR. KATYAL:

The second point is, even if

21

you are concerned about any discrepancy, point -- 4.2 of

22

the actual plan itself -- and this is page 22 of the PDF

23

that was submitted by -- lodged by my friends on the

24

other side a few days ago -- has essentially an

25

anti-Amara clause in it.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It says that the benefits that are provided

2

under the plan are those put forth in the summary plan

3

description.

4

in the plan in this case, unlike in Amara where there

5

very well was a discrepancy.

So there is no discrepancy between the SPD

6

So here --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, the phrase

8

that you just read says that the benefits are the same.

9

It doesn't say that the reimbursement and subrogation

10

language are the same.

11

So go back to Justice Ginsburg's question

12

and point out in the plan what words you're relying

13

upon, not the summary, but the plan.

14

MR. KATYAL:

So the plan has, in 4.7, two

15

things.

It has, "The plan" -- quote, "The plan shall

16

have the right to recover from any participant the

17

amount of any benefits paid by this plan for expenses

18

which were recovered from or paid by a source, other

19

than this plan."

20

And then later, in 4.6, it says,

21

participants are -- quote, "are obligated to avoid doing

22

anything that would prejudice the plan's right of

23

recovery."

24
25

So I don't think that there is any
discrepancy, Justice Sotomayor.

And to the extent that

12

Alderson Reporting Company

1

this Court were concerned about it, there were 4 years

2

for them to have made this an issue, but this is just

3

about as procedurally barred as -- as anything --

JUSTICE BREYER:

So if I were -- if I were

Joe Smith, and a plan -- the plan pays me 100 -- I have

6

medical expenses of $100,000.

7

the -- there was a driver who caused this problem.

8

later, I collect 100,000, but I have to pay 50,000 to

9

get the 100,000.

And, actually, the –And

So in comes the plan and says, we

Then I look at the

The language allows them to get back expenses

17

18

third-party.

19

20

I'm left

I recovered 50,000 from the third-party

Now, if I were a judge and listening to

21

that, I'd say, assuming they wanted a reasonable

22

interpretation of this language, it sounds pretty

23

reasonable to me.

24
25

MR. KATYAL:

All right.

And,

Justice Breyer, if you were the district court judge in
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this case, I suppose you could have reached that result.

2

The district court here --

3
4

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a little tough, since

nobody had the plan.

5

MR. KATYAL:

Well, they -- they had the

6

summary plan description, and they did not make an

7

issue of it.

8

requests, but never made a request for that --

9

They had all sorts of discovery

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But, I mean,

10

wouldn't the normal result of such a case, like any

11

contract case, where you have language, even if it was

12

the word "any," it doesn't mean wheat grown on Mars,

13

okay?

14

And so you'd say -- if it says you can

15

recover anything, that "any expense," it means, yes, you

16

can recover that which was paid, but not money that you

17

had to pay to get the amount paid.

18

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Breyer, we absolutely

19

agree that a plan could be written in order to

20

embrace --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

they wrote and that US Air -MR. KATYAL:

The issue of law is what happens if we have a plan which

20

21

And we are

MR. KATYAL:

So, again, we're not overriding

22

with the principle of equity.

We're saying that the

23

rules of equity, if they have in the plan an abrogation

24

of the common fund, as that is here, in the way this

25

case comes to the Court, then that is what settles the
15

Alderson Reporting Company

question.

2

Now, you could have a Sereboff plan, which

3

says the reverse, which says, we're going to have a

4

common fund doctrine and avoid that problem at the

5

outset.

transfer of assets at the outset, and that's what

7

controls.

answer on that.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought it took most

of the litigation for the plan to be provided.

4

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Sotomayor, at the

5

outset, they asked for the summary plan description or

6

the plan.

7

Only --

8
9

The summary plan description was provided.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. KATYAL:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Their lawyer.

MR. KATYAL:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

This is not -- you know, an

ignorant layman who knows nothing about the law.

13

15

I assume

you mean their lawyer?

10

12

You say, "they."

That's correct.
The lawyer, you say, did

not ask for the plan.
MR. KATYAL:

And -- and I should say, the

17

minute that US Air found out that a tort -- a

18

plaintiff's lawyer was hired, they sent a letter to that

19

lawyer saying, we assert a right of reimbursement.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Katyal, could I ask

21

you about the legal argument that you are making, the

22

distinction you are making between reimbursement

23

agreements and subrogation agreements, which you

24

think -- seem to think is critical here.

25

know, once you put it in one box, rather than another,
17

Alderson Reporting Company

And -- you

1

some result follows -- different results follow. 

Yes. 


2

MR. KATYAL:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- so how do you know 


4

whether you have a reimbursement agreement or a 


5

subrogation agreement?

6

categorization?

7

And what follows from that

MR. KATYAL:

So, Justice Kagan, there are

8

two very distinct rights.

Subrogation is the right to

9

stand in someone else's shoes.

And so the insured --

10

the plan says, we are going to inherit all of the

11

benefits and burdens of the insured in bringing an

12

action.

13

notion.

14

It's a vicarious -- it's a kind of vicarious

Reimbursement's an entirely different

15

concept.

16

to give you this money because we're not at fault in

17

this accident, but we're going to essentially advance it

18

to you, but you've got to reimburse us for it.

19

so --

20
21
22

It's the idea that, look, we're not obligated

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

So if this were a

subrogation agreement, what would follow?
MR. KATYAL:

So if it were a subrogation

23

agreement, I think my friend's case on the other side

24

gets a lot stronger because there are subrogation cases

25

that -- that have different rules.
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But when you talk about reimbursement, which

2

is not the right to stand in someone's shoes, but a

3

first priority absolute agreement between the parties to

4

get money, it's just simply a dispute about that money.

5

And you can't --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if your friend's argument

7

would get a lot stronger if it were a subrogation

8

agreement, how do we tell that this agreement is a

9

reimbursement agreement, rather than -- are we supposed

10

to just take that because that's the way the Court --

11

it's come to us?

12

why there is a reimbursement?

13

Or -- or is there an argument about

MR. KATYAL:

There is an argument.

And,

14

indeed, all I think you have to do, Justice Kagan, is

15

look at what happened in Sereboff because, in Sereboff,

16

you had essentially the same thing, a plan that had both

17

a reimbursement provision and a subrogation provision.

18

And the -- the beneficiaries in Sereboff were saying,

19

hey, this is subrogation, this is subrogation.

20

And the language that I've read to

21

Justice Ginsburg at page 368, as well as earlier

22

language in the opinion, said, no, this is actually a

23

claim for an equitable lien by agreement that does not

24

sound in subrogation, that sounds in reimbursement.

25

And so all you have to do here is precisely
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what this Court unanimously did in Sereboff, which is to

2

say, look at the nature of the action, is this an action

3

that seeks personal liability, does it specify a

4

particular fund, the typical hallmarks of an action for

5

an equitable lien by agreement; and, if those are

6

present, as they are here, that is enough.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you, in effect, asking

8

for a windfall because Mr. McCutchen and his attorneys

9

didn't understand what ERISA means in this context?
If they understood that things would work

10
11

out the way you think they should work out and they saw

12

that the limits of the insurance policies against which

13

they could collect were $110,000, wouldn't they have

14

realized that this was a suit that wasn't worth

15

pursuing?

16

nothing would be -- nothing would be gained for

17

Mr. McCutchen or for the attorneys.

18

MR. KATYAL:

There would be no point in doing it because

Not at all, Justice Alito.

19

One, the rule on ERISA -- and this rule has

20

been the rule in the Third Circuit since Federal Express

21

22

an attorney comes and takes a case, knowing that there

Not so.

This is both in our

What usually happens in these situations is

8

that an agreement is struck in advance, before the

9

lawsuit is filed, between the plan and the plaintiff's

10

attorney to reach some accommodation.

4

MR. KATYAL:

I do -- I do think that there

5

were lots -- and this is in Joint Appendix, pages 50 to

6

64 -- lots of communications between the two.

7

Now, here's -- there was one place where

8

there wasn't communication, which was they went and

9

negotiated a secret settlement of $100,000.

10
11

And when US

Air found out about it -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, were they

12

supposed to -- if the insurance limit was $100,000, are

13

you suggesting that that was a bad-faith settlement?

14

MR. KATYAL:

I am suggesting that we didn't

15

have the opportunity, Justice Sotomayor, that we

16

typically do in the lion's share of cases, as I was

17

saying to Justice Alito, where you work these things out

18

in agreement -- in advance with clear lines of

communication.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Justice Kagan's question

subrogation and reimbursement.

argument that this is not subrogation.

rather confusingly drafted.

The plan is

subrogation.

2

I don't think it really means subrogation.
If it's not subrogation, Justice Kagan's

3

question was, what then?

4

still does not apply?

5

The -- the common fund rule

Because?

MR. KATYAL:

Because the common fund rule --

6

and, this, we are in agreement on, the parties -- the

7

common fund rule is a doctrine based in unjust

8

enrichment.

9

what all the courts say common fund is.

This is what they say at page 26.

This is

10

And, indeed, up until six months ago, seven

11

different circuit courts had evaluated this question of

12

whether the agreement can trump the common fund

13

doctrine.

14

did.

21 of 21 circuit court judges all said it

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you are still in

equity, pursuant to the statute.

17

MR. KATYAL:

Yes.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And are you saying that

19

there is no discretion in the equitable decrees that the

20

judge made?

21

MR. KATYAL:

That -- that is precisely

22

right.

The agreement sets the evaluation of the

23

parties.

24

their own treatise says, what the Arkansas Supreme Court

25

says.

That's what the State Farm case says, what

Where there is a legal

right, equity cannot overcome it.

Solicitor General says, at page 17, quoting the

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

brought.

3

And --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Equitable powers to enforce

the agreement?
Yes. 


5

MR. PALMORE:

6

And so we agree with Mr. Katyal in what 


7

we've characterized as the first question presented, 


8

that we think is essentially decided by this Court's 


9

case in Sereboff. 

At equity, when there was a -- an equitable

10
11

lien by agreement, that agreement was generally

12

enforceable according to its terms.

13

mortgage, is the classic case, and the mortgage gave a

14

security interest in land; and, if the debt was not paid

15

off, then the lienholder could -- could foreclose on

16

that land.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It was like a

Mr. Palmore, do you agree

18

with Mr. Katyal's view of this distinction between

19

subjugation -- subrogation agreements and reimbursement

20

agreements and which this agreement is?

21

MR. PALMORE:

I think that's a -- the --

22

there is certainly a distinction, and the Couch

23

Insurance treatise talks about the -- the distinction.

24

But the Couch Insurance treatise also explains that the

25

terms are often used interchangeably in a confusing way.
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So I don't think that the bright line that

2

Mr. Katyal seeks to establish between subrogation and

3

reimbursement is necessarily reflected in all the cases

4

and all the --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think you can say

6

that about any legal rule, that some courts bollox them

7

up.

8

it's sometimes used in a confusing way?

I mean, that means the rule doesn't exist because

9
10

MR. PALMORE:

that the courts do use these terms interchangeably.

11
12
13

No, I think it's just the fact

JUSTICE SCALIA:
the rule?

What's the rule?

What's

Do you acknowledge that that is the rule?
MR. PALMORE:

We acknowledge that, when

14

there is a -- when there is a contractual plan-based

15

reimbursement provision like this, it is enforceable as

16

an equitable lien by agreement, in the same way that an

17

equitable lien by agreement would have been --

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but I think Mr. Katyal

19

said that, if this were a subrogation agreement,

20

Mr. McCutchen would have a much better argument because

21

a different set of rules would apply.

22

this categorization question quite meaningful.

23

And so that makes

Now, you could say, well, we don't see it as

24

all that meaningful.

We think, no matter what you call

25

this agreement, the same rules apply.
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Or you could say,

Official

1

yes, different rules apply with respect to these two

2

different kinds of agreements, and your job is to figure

3

out which kind of agreement this is.

4

MR. PALMORE:

Right.

We think -- as the --

5

as the case comes to the Court, this is a case for

6

reimbursement.

7

a reimbursement agreement.

8
9

This is just like Sereboff, and this is

What -- what adds to the confusion is
that -- and if you look at more modern insurance

10

decisions, they're bringing in all kinds of concepts

11

from State law, from insurance law, from public policy

12

of the State.

13

have happened in a court in equity at the time of the

14

divided bench, and that's the import --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

They don't necessarily reflect what would

But that's my exact

16

question.

17

decide is, from your point of view, does the common fund

18

doctrine apply?

19

I think, now, what we're being asked to

I take it the common fund doctrine says, if

20

this victim here got some money back from the person who

21

caused the accident, that that money goes into a common

22

fund, in the sense that those who share in the fund must

23

share as well in the cost of producing the fund.

24

So if it costs 50,000 to produce 100,000,

25

which is in the fund, that we have to have US Air, as
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

well, pay part of the cost of producing the fund.

2

sounds very fair.

3

That

But I hear the argument, fair though it is,

4

we have here an agreement, and in this agreement, it

5

says, it's as if it said, and you shall not apply the

6

common fund doctrine or any other equitable doctrine,

7

such as he who seeks equity must do equity, etc.

8

think that's the question that's being asked.

9

And I

And so what is your response to that?

In

10

particular, why do you say the common fund doctrine

11

applies, though the contract says it doesn't, we assume,

12

but all these other equitable doctrines don't apply?

13

MR. PALMORE:

Because we think the

14

equitable -- equitable doctrines that apply are the

15

equitable doctrines that would have applied at equity.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Good.

So now, we have 18th

17

century authority which says that, in the 18th century,

18

Lord Cooke or someone said that the common fund doctrine

19

applies, but the other doctrines don't.

20

the name and citation to that authority is?

21

MR. PALMORE:

And the -- and

Well, there is not one

22

authority that is going to give you both -- both

23

answers.

24

the time of equity, as I mentioned before, were

25

typically mortgage cases or a promise to provide future

But the equitable lien by agreement cases from

28

Alderson Reporting Company

And it's clear, under those cases, that that

could be executed, according to its terms.

The unjust

4

enrichment principles that Respondent is invoking were

5

in a -- really a different silo involving equitable

6

restitution.

7

not going to look at equitable restitution principles,

8

we are going to look at equitable lien by agreement

9

cases.

And this Court in Sereboff said, we are

15

And, as Mr. Katyal said, it has at times been

Its roots are actually in an

16

If you look back to the principal case that

17

established this, the Greenough case that we talk about

18

in our brief, the Court said that the -- Mr. Vose,

19

who -- the bondholder who had secured a benefit for all

20

the bondholders, had -- while not a trustee, had acted

the part of a trustee.

23

trustee is entitled to reimbursement for reasonable

expenses from the trust itself.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We have an agreement, which

powers, and it can use various of them to enforce the

2

for here.

3

MR. PALMORE:

No, we -- we are saying that

4

Section 502(a)(3) takes the settled powers of the court

5

in equity as it finds them.

6

can't divest the Court of those powers, it can't add to

7

those powers, like this Court held in Great-West; it

8

also can't take away from them.

11

And the -- and the plan

But, if I could go to an equity answer,
because I think this is important -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Do you really

12

think that if -- if an equity court finds the agreement

13

to be unfair, it can say, he who seeks equity must do

14

equity, and rewrite the agreement, so that it's fairer?

15

MR. PALMORE:

Not on general unfairness

16

grounds, but it was a settled principle at trust -- of

17

trust law, and remember, Greenough based the common fund

18

doctrine on trust law that if, for instance, a trust

19

document had said, the trustee shall take his expenses

20

from the trust corpus, not from the income -- or

21

vice-versa, says the trustee shall take his expenses

22

from the income, but not from the trust corpus -- if

23

that proved unworkable or unfair and the trustee

24

couldn't discharge his obligations to maintain the

25

trust, the court of equity had broad reformation powers

because Amara said that Section 502(a)(3) incorporates

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W.H. WESSLER

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. WESSLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
34


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

please the Court:

2

Reimbursement claims that are based on an

3

express subrogation agreement are subject to equitable

4

principles of subrogation.

5

In equity, these claims were governed,

6

according to the same principles that governed every

7

other type of subrogation.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your opponent says this is

not a subrogation agreement, so that argument goes

10

nowhere.

11

us why this is a subrogation agreement, even though you

12

conceded below that it isn't.

13

He would concede that point.

MR. WESSLER:

You have to tell

Your Honor, it is a

14

subrogation agreement.

The claim, however, that

15

Petitioners have pursued here, is a reimbursement claim.

16

And -- but it's based on an express subrogation clause.

17

And in equity, reimbursement claims, which,

18

to be clear, are distinct from subrogation claims

19

because they involve a suit directly against the

20

insured, as opposed to against the tortfeasor, are

21

governed by the same principles of subrogation that

22

equity treated -- equity used that -- to apply to all

23

claims that involved an insurer who is seeking to

24

recover money from either an insured or a tortfeasor.

25

And so we concede, absolutely, Your Honor,
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the claim is one for reimbursement for monies

2

recovered out of a fund obtained by the insured.

3

it's -- it's based on an expressed subrogation --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But

That's not what I say

5

you've conceded.

6

opponent denies that the common fund doctrine applies.

7

And it says this is an equitable lien by agreement, so

8

that the common fund doctrine doesn't apply.

9
10
11

That's the common fund doctrine.

Your

Now, you -- you say it is not an equitable
lien by agreement?

Is that your position?

MR. WESSLER:

No, Your Honor.

We -- it --

12

to be clear, it is an equitable lien by agreement, but

13

it arises within the doctrine of subrogation, which is,

14

as Couch and Palmer and other treatises explain, is an

15

umbrella term that is used to describe all of the rights

16

and rules that govern claims by insurers for money back

17

after they've paid it out under a policy.

18

Now, the form of the action in this case is

19

a -- is a claim for reimbursement out of a fund, but the

20

mere fact that that's the form of the action, which, in

21

Sereboff, this Court called an equitable lien by

22

agreement, does not alter the underlying rule that

23

equity courts in the days of the divided bench would

24

have applied to the claim.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But doesn't Sereboff suggest
36


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not?

2

but if you read the text in Sereboff, it says, these

3

affirmative defenses that would arise in a normal

4

subrogation context are beside the point.

5

they not the beside the point?

6

I mean, I realize that Sereboff has this footnote,

MR. WESSLER:

So how are

They are not beside the point

7

for -- for one reason, and let me -- let me explain why.

8

What the Court actually said in Sereboff was that the

9

parcel of equitable defenses accompanying a

10

free-standing claim or free-standing action for

11

equitable subrogation are beside the point.

12

free-standing action for equitable subrogation is not

13

one based on an agreement.

14

claim for subrogation or reimbursement based on the mere

15

fact that the insurer has paid the money.

16
17

A

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's an implied claim, a

So is that true that, in

Sereboff, there was no agreement?
MR. WESSLER:

There was, but what this

19

Court -- there was absolutely an agreement, just as

20

there is an agreement in this case.

21

distinction the Court drew in Sereboff was it said that

22

whatever principles apply to free-standing claims are

23

beside the point, because -- precisely because the claim

24

was based on an agreement.

25

What the -- the

That is absolutely correct.

And it's perfectly consistent with our
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position because we believe that the principles in

2

equity that governed exactly the kinds of claims that

3

were at issue in Sereboff and are at issue here,

4

reimbursement claims based on an express agreement, are,

5

in fact, governed by the same principles of unjust

6

enrichment.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't understand

8

that because it seems to me that, when Sereboff said it

9

was beside the point, they were refuting the arguments

10

that the insured party was making, that the insured

11

party was saying, hey, look, we have these great

12

defenses.

13

And -- and you are saying they had an

14

agreement, but they also said they have these great

15

defenses, and the Court said, too bad, those defenses

16

don't work for you here.

17

MR. WESSLER:

The Court -- the -- the

18

beneficiary, Your Honor, in Sereboff, argued that the

19

defenses that applied to a -- a freestanding or implied

20

claim for equitable subrogation should control the --

21

the measure of relief available in the case.

22

They said -- it -- the contract doesn't

23

matter.

The -- the agreement makes no difference.

the plan is trying to obtain here is a pure,

25

freestanding claim for subrogation.

after that, that says something --

21

MR. WESSLER:

And he says that that principle, quote,

23

"should serve to limit the effectiveness of contract

24

provisions which in terms provide for reimbursement out

25

of the insured's tort recovery, without regard to

whether or the extent to which that recovery includes

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this the part --

4

I might be mixing this up with something else, but is

5

this the part where he says, unfortunately, the courts

6

don't agree with that?

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. WESSLER:

9

He -- he -- he identifies two

decisions -- that -- you're correct, Your Honor -- he

10

identifies two decisions, which did something contrary

11

to that rule.

12

governs these claims.

13

But, in his view, that is the rule that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's go back to what

14

the -- the simple argument.

We have an agreement here,

15

and the plan is asking for what the agreement gives it.

16

Why is the plan unjustly enriched by receiving exactly

17

what the plan entitles it to receive?

18

MR. WESSLER:

Because, Your Honor, these --

19

these insurance reimbursement cases arose in a very

20

different context from most other equitable lien by

21

agreement cases.

22

And the core difference in -- between these

23

cases and all 22 or -- or more of the cases that the

24

Petitioner cites, is that they involve a third party,

25

who has caused the loss both to the insurer and the
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

insured.

2

reimbursement cases is not the defendant.

3

And that third party, the tortfeasor, in these

And so, in two-party equitable lien by

4

agreement cases, which are -- all of the cases that

5

Petitioner cites involve two-party cases in which the

6

defendant is also the wrongdoer, is the person who is

7

culpable and who has caused the -- the Plaintiff's loss.

8

In those cases, when courts awarded relief, they awarded

9

relief that was consistent with the defendant's unjust

10

enrichment, but was also co-extensive with or consistent

11

with the loss under the contract.

12

In these three-party cases, however, because

13

the defendant, who is -- who is a beneficiary, not --

14

not the tortfeasor, did not actually trigger the loss,

15

courts developed, in equity, a different set of rules to

16

apply to -- to measure the relief available under the

17

claim.

18

And what they said was, where there is a

19

fund that is insufficient, where it cannot cover all of

20

the losses suffered by all of the parties, that -- that

21

all of the parties must share equally with -- of the

22

loss.

rights under this contract can be enforced in law or --

14

Whenever -- whenever you have a contract

like that, it's going to be up to the court of equity to

To be sure, the contract says that --

that -- you know, all equitable remedies are available

6

But why is it an equitable

MR. WESSLER:

It -- it could be either, Your

Honor.

And we've cited -- cited to this Court cases

8

in -- in the days of the divided bench, in which a party

9

could have sought legal relief for breach for this exact

10

kind of claim, but there was also a remedy that a party

11

could seek in equity.

12

But in order to do that, in order to -- to

13

enter equity's doors on this reimbursement theory, it --

14

it had to agree to allow other parties their correlative

15

rights in equity, and it also had to agree not to

override or defeat the -- the rules in equity that

typically would --

MR. WESSLER:

As a specific performance

case.

That -- that was a specific type of -- of remedy.

24

The remedy here that's being sought is an equitable lien

by agreement, but -- but in our view, when an insurer

Alderson Reporting Company

1

sought to enforce, through an equitable lien by

2

agreement, a claim or a lien on a fund, it must agree to

3

take that relief, subject to the way equity would have

treated the claim.

5

And what Palmer and what Couch and -- and

6

what the cases we've cited say is that, even for those

7

reimbursement claims that are based or arise on an

8

express agreement, that the relief available is limited

9

in two concrete ways.
The -- the insurer could not get more out of

10
11

the fund than its share of the fund that accounted for

12

the medical expenses it paid, and it must have agreed to

reduce proportionately for an amount of -- of fees and

costs.

So -- so, Your Honor, the Svea

case, is -- is, I think, our best example.

case, the insurer had a subrogation agreement, which

24

authorized it to recover -- authorized recovery to,

25

quote, "the extent of its payment" out of, quote, "all
48

Alderson Reporting Company

And in that

rights of recovery of the insured."

2

And in that case, there was an underlying

3

settlement that the insured reached with the tortfeasor,

4

the wrongdoer.

5

not participate in that underlying proceeding at all.

6

And after that occurred, the insurer then directly sued

7

the insured.

8
9

And after that occurred, the insurer did

This is exactly the kind of case we're
talking about here, seeking recovery out of the fund.

10

And they based that claim on their -- on their express

11

subrogation agreement.

12

approximately $3,000.

13

$9,000.

And they said, we paid
You recovered something like

We should get $3,000 back.

14

And the court there said, no, because the

15

fund was insufficient to cover all of the losses --

16

the -- the insured did not recover for all of its

17

losses, several other claimants did not recover for all

18

of their losses -- and the court said that, because the

19

fund was insufficient, the -- the insurer was limited to

20

recovering -- and I'm quoting here -- "no more than its

21

proportion of the amount recovered after deducting costs

22

and fees."

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Wessler, would it be

fair to say -- I mean, we're in this unusual position

10

because we're supposed to be looking back to before the

11

1930s sometime.

12

Would it be fair to say that we just don't

13

have very many cases, and Mr. Katyal doesn't have any,

14

and you don't have any, that raise this question that,

15

where somebody walks into an equity court with a

16

contract, and we try to figure out whether the equity

17

court is going to use these unjust enrichment defenses?

18

Would it be fair to say that we just don't know?

19

MR. WESSLER:

I -- I think -- I think that

20

it's fair to say that this did not arise that frequently

21

in courts of equity.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

MR. WESSLER:

24
25

Why didn't it?
Be -- for -- for several

reasons, Your Honor.
First, most of these claims arose simply as
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

freestanding or implied claims.

2

there was no need for an insurer to include in its

3

insurance policy an expressed subrogation agreement.

4

So there was not --

However, that -- that changed approximately

5

around the turn -- the mid-20th century, when medical

6

insurance started to become an increasing commodity.

7

When that occurred, most States had a -- a prohibition

8

on the assignment of personal injury claims.

9

And so what insurers began to do to get

10

around that prohibition was to insert in their -- in

11

their policies an express clause allowing them to obtain

12

reimbursement from the insured, in the event that the

13

insured recovered money that it had paid.

14

Now, there is another reason in this case --

15

or in these ERISA cases -- why these agreements need to

16

be in the plan.

17

itself does not allow for a plan, like Petitioner, to

18

obtain a general right to equitable relief.

19

the Petitioner can -- can seek here is equitable --

20

appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of its

21

plan.

22

And that's because Section 502(a)(3)

All that

And so, in the absence of an expressed

23

provision, like a subrogation clause, it would not be

24

entitled to pursue a -- a general right to subrogation.

25

It's a term -- that back-end reference is
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a -- is a term of limitation that limits the types of 


2

claims that Petitioner can bring in these cases. 


3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, can -- I 


4

want to give you an opportunity to respond to the 


5

argument that you've waived, the -- the -- your argument

6

based on the distinction between the summary of the plan

7

and the plan.

8
9

And there are two things that concern me
about that, in particular.

The summary of the plan,

10

which you've had all the time, says, on page 1, "This is

11

only a summary.

12

a legal plan document.

13

between the information in the summary and the legal

14

plan, the legal plan" -- "the legal plan document will

15

govern."

16

Complete plan details are contained in
If there is any difference

So when you had the summary, you were on

17

notice that, if there were any difference between it and

18

the plan, the plan would govern.

19

the plan in June of 2012.

20

You received a copy of

Okay?

And as late as August 29th of 2012,

21

two-and-a-half months afterward, you filed a Joint

22

Appendix that didn't -- didn't contain the provision

23

that you say now governs.

24

to have waived that?

25

So why shouldn't you be held

The first time we found out about that was
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in your red brief that was filed -- June, July, August,

2

September -- three months -- October -- four months

3

after you had the plan.

So didn't you waive it?

MR. WESSLER:

Well, I -- I don't think we

waived it, Your Honor.

merits to this Court, and --

8

10

It's in our opening brief on the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Which was four

months after you had the plan and -- and the plan was
lodged with us last week for the first time.

11

MR. WESSLER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

12

In our view -- and -- and I think I need to be clear

13

about this.

14

contains a different set of rights than -- than the SPD,

15

to us, is meaningful in -- in its -- in its effect that

16

it will have on this case when this -- if and when this

17

Court remands because -- because, in our view, the

18

rights are different.

19

I mean, the -- the fact that the plan

However, I -- it doesn't change the

20

underlying nature of our argument, which is that, even

21

the strong form argument that Petitioners have made

22

here, which is that, on the SPD, it can defeat the --

23

the rules that typically would have applied, that equity

24

would not have allowed that.

25

And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
53

Alderson Reporting Company

The problem is that

Official

1

the district court interpreted the plan as precluding

2

the claim you're making here.

3

that's not true is based not on the summary of the plan,

4

but on the plan itself.

And your argument that

5

MR. WESSLER:

That --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And what the

7

district court does is it defers to the administrator's

8

interpretation of the plan.

9

that the administrator's interpretation was not

10

So the district court found

arbitrary and capricious.

11

So what your friend is arguing is that,

12

well, you are kind of stuck with the district court

13

interpretation, and you can't, at the last minute, argue

14

that it shouldn't control because of some other

15

document.

16

MR. WESSLER:

Well -- well, we think we do

17

have the right to argue that on remand, Your Honor.

18

And -- and this Court's decision in Cigna only -- only

19

arose in this case after the -- the briefs were complete

20

to the Third Circuit.

21

And so it's -- I -- I think Cigna has

22

changed the law to the extent that all parties are now

23

on notice and know that the plan document will trump any

24

contrary language --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, no, Cigna

Official

1

didn't tell you that.

2

that.

It says, "Complete plan details are in the legal

3

plan.

If there is any difference between the summary

4

and the plan, the plan controls."

5

Cigna to tell you that.

6

The plan -- the summary told you

MR. WESSLER:

So you didn't need

Well -- well, Your -- Your

7

Honor, I mean, I -- I think that the -- the -- you know,

8

that -- for us, that's an issue on remand.

9

comfortable that our arguments in this case control,

We're

10

even -- even as it relates to the actual language in the

11

SPD and that -- and that whatever differences between

12

the SPD and the plan actually are don't necessarily

13

change the rules that govern when a -- when a party in

14

equity sought this kind of reimbursement relief directly

15

from -- from an insured.

16

I'd like, just -- just for the last minute

17

or so, to discuss the common fund rule because I do

18

think it applies as a separate and distinct rule,

19

regardless of how this Court interprets the agreement as

20

governing the rights between Mr. McCutchen, the

21

beneficiary, and the plan.

22

And I'd just like to point out that this

23

Court, in Pettus, made clear that the common fund

24

doctrine confers a separate lien on the attorney.

25

so whatever the agreements control between the
55

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

beneficiary and the plan has, it cannot defeat the

2

rights that the attorney has, as a separate matter, to

3

come into court and invoke its own lien on the fund as a

4

first priority lien over the money.

5

And -- and I -- and I'd just like to point

6

out that Petitioners have not responded to that

7

argument.

8

why their theory would allow them to defeat the rights

9

of a third-party defendant in this case, Mr. McCutchen's

10

Nowhere in their reply brief did they explain

lawyers, who have their own separate right to the lien.

11

And -- and none of their equitable lien

12

cases, Your Honor, involve any kind of common fund

13

whatsoever.

14

rules that would have applied in equity to an attorney's

15

attempt to -- to take their proportion out of the fund

16

before it was distributed to any of the parties.

17

So they say precisely nothing about the

discussing the common fund would be the allocation

19

between McCutchen and the plan.

20

talking only about the attorney's right to come in

21

first.

MR. WESSLER:

But now, you seem to be

MR. WESSLER:

Sure.

As a deduction out of the

entire fund for the attorney's lien or it can be applied

4

McCutchen's own claim.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you.

14

I'd like to begin where -- where Mr. Wessler

15

left off, with the common fund, and make three quick

16

points.

17

The first is that both equity law and ERISA

18

law point in the same direction.

19

absolutely right, that they have zero cases that say, if

20

there's a preexisting agreement that settles the common

21

fund doctrine, that that makes it not enforceable.

22

Justice Scalia is

And Justice Ginsburg's absolutely right to

23

say that when the plan -- the plan is not unjustly

24

enriched, to get the money that they are entitled to get

25

under the contract.
57

The second point I would make is that the
Solicitor General says, well, this is now --

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Put on the back of

someone else, meaning --

5

MR. KATYAL:

I agree.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- I may or may not

7

agree that, in terms of your split with the participant,

8

the contract might control.

9

trouble with understanding how you can bind a third

But I still am having

10

party, like a lawyer, who's done the effort to recover

11

that fund -- more along Justice Breyer's question, which

12

is not only in -- in all equity, lawyers are entitled,

13

whether by contract or by unjust enrichment principles,

14

to a -- to a percentage of their expenses in recovering

15

something.

16

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Sotomayor, that's

17

precisely what cases like State Farm and the Arkansas

18

case from 1969, the Maryland case from 1931, address,

19

which is that situation.

20

essentially here -- it's a mistake to see this as a

21

third-party case.

22

And the reason is that

This is really a situation created by

23

Mr. McCutchen double-promising the same money to two

24

entities, US Air and to his lawyers.

25

essentially a dispute, really, among two parties, not
58

Alderson Reporting Company

And so it's

Official

1

three.

2

Now, the Solicitor General says, well, this

3

is rooted in -- in equitable doctrine.

4

that they have that says that there's some equitable

5

doctrine that trumps the preexisting agreement.

6

indeed, the case that they cite, the Greenough case, is

7

one that essentially relies on unjust enrichment

8

principles.

9

There is no case

And,

Sure, the Court has an equity power when to

10

remedy unjust enrichment.

11

the Court.

12

are saying is that, when you have an agreement in

13

advance, that means, per se, there is no unjust

14

enrichment, that they are, to use this Court's language

15

in Sereboff, a defense that it is beside the point.

16

That is an inherent power of

We're not disagreeing with that.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What we

Counsel, I'm assuming,

17

because ERISA's in place now, that the many State laws

18

that prohibit this kind of agreement, where insurance

19

plans are seeking full reimbursement, despite an

20

attorney's efforts, that those are void, that those

21

would be enforceable.

22

MR. KATYAL:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

That is precisely -The only one who can fix

this problem now is Congress, if they -MR. KATYAL:

That is correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- if they perceive it

as a problem.

3

MR. KATYAL:

Congress, in 1974, set it up

4

this way.

And I think that that's an important point,

5

Justice Sotomayor.

6

embraced an idea that Federal common law allows

7

rewriting of plan terms.

8

doctrine to do so.

9

For 38 years, this Court has never

It would be a very dangerous

It'd be standardless.

And here is a very vivid example:

They are

10

saying that it is inequitable to have the Federal Blue

11

Cross/Blue Shield plan, which governs 4.6 million

12

people, including perhaps members of this Court, which

13

has the exact same provisions as the US Air plan, an

14

abrogation of common fund and a 100 percent

15

reimbursement provision.

16

And they are saying that that would not be

17

enforceable.

That may create any number of problems for

18

the government, I imagine, when it tries to enforce

19

that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Suppose the expense weren't

21

to pay the lawyer.

Suppose, in order to get the

22

100,000, you had, for example, to build a model car to

23

demonstrate to the manufacturer what caused the injury,

24

and it cost you 98,000 to do it.

25

100,000.

And they pay you

You're saying that -- it wouldn't be unjust
to say the 100,000 has to go to -- back to pay US Air?

3

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Breyer, if the

4

agreement settled that in advance, yes, it would not be

5

unjust.

It is the agreement that controls.
