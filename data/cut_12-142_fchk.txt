This is a classic case of impossibility

safety profile as the branded version.

ingredient or a different warning.

as compared to warnings, but as to design, they're

They have to go

And that's just as true of brand

names as it is of generics.

11

So am I right about that?

12

we're just looking at a pure design defect claim,

13

putting the warning card aside, where you are in a

14

different position from the brand-name drugs, but as to

15

design, don't the brand-name and the generics go hand in

16

hand?

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

That -- that if

brief.

20

arguments to differ.

21

it's really a distinction without a difference in real

22

life because in light of this Court's decision in the

23

Wyeth case, what happens across the board is that design

defect claims are brought either as they are in nearly

significant thing in your argument to put aside.

4

5

that didn't have to do with warnings, where you are in a

6

different position.

defect claim, am I right that generics and brand-name

9

those claims?

drug?

14

That is certainly

15

the argument the government makes.

16

or not the Court would find any type of distinction as

17

the Court did in Wyeth, but that is certainly an

18

appropriate interpretation of what the government is

I'm not sure whether

3

brought as failure to warn claims or as design defect

4

claims with warnings components.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

My point is

But, you -- but again, and I

6

know that this is a big part of your argument, but to

7

the extent that a warning was not involved in the claim,

8

and it was just about the design of a drug, I guess I'm

9

asking you, is there any possible way to distinguish

10

between generics and brand-name manufacturers?

11

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

I'm not sure, Your Honor,

12

that there is a way to distinguish.

13

in a regime in a State statute or a State tort regime

14

where the only issue was design, unlike in the New

15

Hampshire design defect, where as we know from PA 18

16

where the First Circuit made clear that it, in fact, was

17

the lack of an adequate warning that in fact made the

18

drug more dangerous under the design defect case, the

19

Supreme Court's case Vautour, which is the leading New

20

Hampshire case.

21

this case was a binary choice.

22

you find that the drug is unreasonably dangerous, then

you have to take a look at was the warning sufficient or

not.

Justice Sotomayor, as this Court made clear in

Mensing -- in Wyeth and as Justice Thomas made clear in

his concurring opinion in that case, just because a drug

is granted an approval by the FDA does not mean that

it's entitled to have the same label for all time.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

to the same point, which is -- and we are sort of

dancing around the argument -- which is what happens

11

with a truly dangerous drug, and we can posit one, that

12

has nothing to do with a warning of whether it's

13

adequate or not, but a drug that on its face no

14

reasonable practitioner -- I'm going to the restatement

15

third formulation -- no reasonable practitioner, knowing

16

all the benefits and risks, would ever prescribe this

drug.

position at trial.

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Well --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It doesn't matter --

22

there were other, safer, one-molecule drugs, no one

23

One of our cases --

And she didn't take --

she didn't take the -- the brand-name drug because the

1

pharmacist gave her the generic, but she didn't know

2

brand, generic, isn't that correct?

3

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

That's correct,

4

Justice Ginsburg, and that's exactly the same issue that

5

we had in the Mensing case a couple years ago.

6

Obviously we understand that not all consumers get to

7

select on their own; their doctors select or maybe their

8

State Medicaid laws make this choice, or the pharmacy,

9

but the standards -- again, conflict preemption comes

10

when the State is imposing a requirement or an

11

obligation or enforcing a standard that you simply can't

12

comply with under Federal law without violating Federal

13

law.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose that New Hampshire

15

had a real strict liability regime, so that you -- you

16

sell a drug, and whether it's unreasonably dangerous or

17

not it causes an injury, you pay, to spread the costs.

18

Would there be a problem with that?

19

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Justice Alito, I think if we

20

had what would really be an absolute liability scheme, I

21

think is really what you are suggesting, something

22

similar to the kind of vaccine compensation program that

23

we heard about this morning, that would not raise

impossibility preemption problems at all.

the design, the Federal regime does operate as a floor

JUSTICE KAGAN:

in describing the FDCA just now, you used the word

penalizes what Federal law authorizes.

But it doesn't say you must sell it, and it

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Your Honor, Justice Kagan,

20

I'd like to give you two answers to that.

21

to the impossibility, for over 50 -- 50 years exactly

22

now, this Court has been articulating as the

23

paradigmatic example of impossibility preemption.

quintessential example of impossibility has nothing to

do with a Federal right at all.

conflicting standards.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It is simply

Well, that is your best

11

case, but -- you know, there are quite a number of cases

12

where we've really held when a Federal law permits

13

something, typically, a State can do more if it wants

14

to.

15

MR. LEFKOWITZ:

Justice Kagan, the very same

16

issue came out in Mensing as well.

After all, PLIVA was

17

not obligated in any way to sell metoclopramide in

18

Mensing.

19

a case of impossibility conflict.

20

Congress has -- as I said, is not agnostic here.

But, of course, this Court found that that was
And moreover,

21

Congress had established a regime where in

22

order to take a drug off the market, Congress had said

23

the FDA has to provide the company with all sorts of due

24

process protection, direct appeal to the Federal court,

25

and in fact, Congress, in 1997, specified that any

at all, withdrawing drugs or approving drugs, has to

6

impossibility perspective, this is not only the Florida

7

Lime example, this is the Mensing case as well.

The Respondent recognizes that our hands are

The Respondent also doesn't really try to do

14

much with salvaging the First Circuit's dodge on

supremacy by saying we could stay out of the market.

16

Instead, what the Respondent does is he tries to carve

17

out a distinction between strict liability and

18

negligence claims.

19

And all I will say before reserving my time

20

is there's simply no basis in the law.

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

7

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
New Hampshire law applies a hybrid

8

design-defect standard that imposes liability for harm

9

caused by a product if the product, in light of the

10

manufacturer's warnings, is unreasonably dangerous.

11

Now, that standard falls within the

12

traditional way that this Court has looked at

13

impossibility preemption in Mensing.

14

in Levine because the analysis of the courts -- the

15

analysis in Levine reflects an implicit judgment that

16

the manufacturer could simply stop selling the product.

17

You know, if that were enough to avoid a Federal

18

impossibility preemption, there'd be no reason to do

19

the analysis --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's also implicit

Well, but it's a

that the State is going to impose on the manufacturer a

23

different duty than the Federal government.

State tort law, whether by negligence or strict

15

which is distinct, is that if you could simply stop

selling, that would be a way of -- of cancelling

17

impossibility preemption if there were in fact a

18

conflict between the two standards.

There are two, I think, arguments
There is a question of whether

And the second argument, I think,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How would you define the

20

duty that New Hampshire imposed here according to the

21

First Circuit and according to the Respondent?

22

MR. YANG:

The duty is that one cannot

23

market an unreasonably dangerous drug in light of the

24

warnings -- that's unreasonably dangerous in light of

25

the warnings.

And what that means is that a
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

manufacturer will have to pay money in the liability

2

suit if he doesn't meet that standard.

3

And as this Court recognized in Riegel and

4

5

obligation, when you contingent -- make an obligation to

6

pay tort liability based on meeting a standard under

7

State law, that is a duty that could conflict with a

8

Federal duty.

I understand their argument, which is that it's

different where the situation says, yes, you can market

it and avoid payment, but only if you do it our way.

question of stop selling, which I think is what your

2

question goes to, that you can always escape liability

3

if you simply stop selling and don't have the market.

4

It's not clear to me, first, that Respondent is, in

5

fact, adopting the government's position because in our

6

view, the obligation to change the labeling to make it

7

safer and therefore escape liability under design-defect

8

law in New Hampshire falls within the Court's decision

9

in PLIVA v. Mensing.

10

The only distinguishing factor we think that

11

is material here would be whether the ability to stop

12

selling means that there's really not a conflicting

13

obligation.

14

Mensing, it would have been true also in Levine, and

15

would not have necessitated any impossibility analysis.

And as that would have been true in

21

compliance with Federal and State regulation is a

22

physical impossibility for one engaged in interstate

23

commerce.

24
25

The court framed the impossibility preemption

It says, the question is whether

That was the -- the formulation.
So the idea is if you are an avocado grower

in Florida and the Federal government said you have to

2

then California says, you can't sell in our State unless

3

it's 8 percent oil, it's impossible to be a person

4

engaged in interstate commerce there unless you violate

5

one of those obligations.

6

one of those obligations, it's the State law that --

that falls.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, that suggests that

10

there is an obligation of the Federal government.

11

there is one, yes, there's a conflict and yes, there's

12

13

if all there is, is permission from the Federal

14

government, where do you get the impossibility from?

MR. YANG:

Let me draw a distinction if --

have at least 7 percent oil.

It's not impossible to comply there.

here is a comprehensive regulatory scheme, where an

23

expert agency with the relevant information makes an

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I take that point,

3

Mr. Yang.

4

you're -- you're saying something quite deep about the

5

FDCA, which is that the FDCA should not be thought of as

6

merely authorizing drug sales.

7

I take that point, Mr. Yang, but I think then

You're saying essentially that when the --

8

when the FDA does what it does, it's saying not just --

9

you know, you can do this if you want to, but you can do

10

this and we really think this drug ought to be marketed.

11

So that when States take action as against that -- you

that is in fact second-guessing the FDA -- that is

Which is, when the State is imposing

Not simply because the FDA has set the
23

standard, but the FDCA also has within it the judgment

2

that safety is best effectuated not only by having the

3

FDA set the standard, but by forbidding any manufacturer

4

from deviating from that once it's been approved by the

5

FDA.

6

When we're talking about a drug's

7

formulation, the manufacturer cannot change it.

8

that's what brings this within the ambit of

9

PLIVA v. Mensing.

And

And it also, I think, reflects why

10

the Florida Lime example is -- is relevant because

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

16

I'd like to start with the questions that

17

you and Justice Alito posed about State law because it's

18

important to understand, before you have impossibility

19

conflict preemption, to understand what the State duty

20

is here.

21

I think it was conceded that it would not be

22

impossible to have an absolute liability regime.

23

question here is because New Hampshire actually makes it

24

somewhat easier for manufacturers to evade liability,

25

that that somehow creates a different kind of preemption
27

Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Official

1

problem.

We would submit that it doesn't.

2

What the State law is seeking to do here,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, is to impose liability where there is

4

proof of an unreasonably dangerous product.

5

That unreasonable danger entails evidence of

6

a risk/benefit analysis that looks at the overall risks

7

to the population against the overall benefits that are

8

provided to the drug.

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The jury decides all of

this, right?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Twelve -- twelve tried men and few -- and

That's wonderful.

cost/benefit analysis is for a -- a very novel drug that

16

unquestionably has some deleterious effects, but also

can save some lives.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

20

And notably, the FDCA doesn't preclude that.

Yes, it is.

21

Wyeth v. Levine affirms that principle.

22

important here is that under State law, there's not a

23

duty to change the design or to change the label.

is, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, exactly as you

3

It is often the case, Mr. Chief Justice, that in these

4

kinds of cases, the defense applies different tactics to

5

how they defend this case.

6

In this particular case, they chose to waive

7

their comment k affirmative defense.

They chose not to

8

put in any affirmative evidence itself.

9

after the trial in their Rule 50 motion for judgment as

They chose

10

a matter of law not to challenge the warning

11

instructions that were given to the jury -- as Judge

12

Boudin noted and as the district court noted -- they had

13

waived their preemption warning argument.

14

And so what they seek to do here after not

15

being able to show, which they cannot show under New

16

Hampshire Supreme Court precedent, Vautour and Kelleher,

17

cases that we cited in our brief, that New Hampshire

18

imposes any duty to change any conduct by the

19

manufacturer whatsoever.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Frederick, it -- it does

21

seem to me, and I understand that there's a waiver

22

argument floating around here, but it does seem to me

23

that this case was litigated such that the adequacy of

24

the warning is really all over this case.

25

expert testimony about the adequacy of the warning,
30

Alderson Reporting Company

There was

Official

1

there were jury instructions about the adequacy of the

2

warning.

3

In the closing statements that the lawyer

4

gave, it was -- there was a lot of talk about -- that

5

the FDA's decision to change the label, to show that the

6

label was ineffective before.

7

this stuff about adequacy of the warning, which does

8

suggest that this is sort of within the four corners of

9

Mensing.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

So there is just all over

Let me address that because

11

I think that's the hardest part of this case to

12

understand, and why this is different from Mensing.

13

a strict liability case in New Hampshire, the warning is

14

not relevant as a -- as an element of the claim.

15

the jury is required as an element of the claim is to

16

prove unreasonable dangerousness.

17

In

What

And District Judge La Plant, who presided

18

over this very complex and difficult trial with a lot of

19

skill, understood the difference between the concept of

20

adequacy of a warning which describes the risks and

21

efficacy of the warning which limits or minimizes the

22

risks.

23

And all over the pretrial instructions, he

24

made very clear to the counsel, you are not to argue

25

about adequacy of the warning because that goes to the
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

comment k defense that they waived on the eve of trial.

2

Instead, once the jury finds that the drug is

3

unreasonably dangerous, it may use the warning as a way

4

to limit or minimize the risk.

5

In other words, the warning could only

6

benefit Mutual because liability was going to be found

7

in spite of the warning and not because of the warning.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
understand why that matters.

I see that.

But I don't

That is, the -- I mean, I

10

was thinking just what you said.

11

I -- I dissented in the other case, but I lost, okay?

12

So I lost, I lost.

13

that you have a drug, and you say to the jury, well, if

14

there were no warning here at all, then it would be

15

unreasonably dangerous.

16

I was thinking well,

The -- the -- the point is that --

I think, yes, that probably applies to

17

chemotherapy, it probably applies to Parkinson's, it

18

probably applies to all kind, but you see, says the

19

defense, there is a warning here and it says how to use

20

it.

21

despite or whatever it is, despite, not because.

22

And as you say, that would be not -- it would be

But it seems to me in terms of -- it comes

for the same thing, lots of drugs would be dangerous,

too dangerous, unreasonably so without a warning.

And that is because, and this is on -JUSTICE BREYER:

In other words, in this

case, they have to find that -- that no warning -- there

14

MR. FREDERICK:
minimizing the risk.

All that they -- in terms of

Justice Breyer, here --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how can that be,

15

Mr. Frederick, because the plaintiff really spent a

16

large portion of their case trying to show this, that

17

the warning was inadequate.

18

thought that there was a possibility that if the warning

19

was adequate, the jury would find one thing, but if the

20

warning was not adequate, liability would follow.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

So the plaintiff must have

The case as it was litigated

22

up until the day before the trial was with a comment k

23

defense, which allows as an affirmative defense the

24

defendant to say if the drug is unavoidably unsafe and

25

it has an adequate warning, i.e. it adequately describes
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what the risks are, complete immunity from suit.

2

They abandoned that comment k defense on the

3

eve of trial.

4

instructed the jury, the only role that the warning

5

actually played was whether it could lessen the risk to

6

patients who took the drug, i.e. in the risk/benefit

7

analysis, it's somewhat less risky in weighing it

8

against the benefits.

And so as the judge understood and

14

MR. FREDERICK:

Because everything in

two --

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. FREDERICK:

How do I discover that?
-- two pieces.

The JMOL

17

order that the judge issued, which is in the petition

18

appendix, goes through this very clearly.

19

Plant understood how the different roles of warning

20

apply, and he instructed the jury, and this is in the

21

pre-formal colloquy that he's giving to the jury orally,

22

you can find this at 496 of the Joint Appendix where he

23

says, "Adequacy is not an issue for -- the adequacy of

24

the warning is not an issue for you to decide."

25

And Judge Le

He then goes further to explain that "You
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

will only consider the warning after you have considered

2

the unreasonable danger" -- that's at 513 to 514, and

3

then on page 516 of the Joint Appendix, he says, "You

4

only consider the warning to minimize the risk," i.e. to

5

benefit Mutual in the assessment of whether or not in a

6

risk/benefit analysis this drug has greater risks

7

than --

JUSTICE BREYER:
different point.

The second point is a

The second point is, look, I have

10

chemotherapy, it saves 100 and it kills 10.

11

If you have no label at all, a jury might find it was

12

unreasonably dangerous, but once you put in the label

13

explaining the whole thing, it doesn't.

14

unreasonably dangerous because of the situation, and

15

they could perhaps wouldn't find it.

16

All right.

It isn't

Now, you can call that

17

diminishing or you could call it adequacy.

would say it.

JUSTICE BREYER:

We're talking about what

2

juries could find and that's what -- and I don't know

3

about Parkinson's -- I don't know what these drugs are.

4

That's why I said let the FDA say it.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

But that's why when the jury

6

gets evidence that aspirin and acetaminophen, Tylenol

7

produce the same kind of pain relief, but they do not

8

produce the kind of SJS/TEN that Ms. Bartlett -- that

9

caused 60 percent of her body to burn.

10

I mean, that

gives you a very clear contrast.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

If that's correct, and maybe

12

it is, doesn't that mean the drug should never have been

13

approved?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

No, because the evidence at

15

the time of approval had not yet been ascertained.

16

was clear from the unpublished Pharmacia report that

17

went into evidence in this case was that between the

18

time of 1980 and 1997, the adjusted reporting rate of

19

these adverse incidents went very high, and it was of a

20

rate that was comparable to Bextra, which went on the

21

market several years after that study ended, in which

22

the FDA, in looking at a comparable adjusted adverse

23

reporting rate, concluded should be taken off the

24

market.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

What

But isn't it true that when

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the -- the FDA reviewed this whole class of drugs, they

2

decided to pull Bextra, but not this drug?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

That is true, but what the

4

FDA did not take into account, and this is what the

5

district judge instructed the jury on September 22nd,

6

2010, I think it's page 108 in the charging colloquy, is

7

the evidence in this case was that the FDA did not have

8

that evidence.

9

So what the Solicitor General seeks to argue

10

here is evidence that was not in the record and in which

11

Mutual's own expert who created this evidence testified

12

in deposition he didn't give it to the FDA.

13

Mutual never put him on the stand to be cross examined.

14

And so now what we have is a trial record that shows

15

this evidence was not given to the FDA at all.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And then

The -- the SG says that the

17

FDA did have this right, did have it and did consider

18

it, and that's incorrect?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

That is incorrect.

That the

20

FDA, if it considered it, there is no record of it doing

21

so because in the response to the 2005 citizen petition

22

and in a later memorandum, it never mentions sulindac.

23

So if you are to take any kind of regulatory preemption

24

18

There is a difference between the

Now, it may well be that there could be

cases out there like your life-saving type drug, which

statute to ensure that that is on the market, and some

such.

5

because Mutual had not put in any evidence of the

benefit of its drug at all and arguably couldn't have

7

done so because this drug is like aspirin -- except that

it causes these horrific injuries -- it's reasonable to

suppose that a jury which can decide misbranding actions

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Just -- just to --

2

because my memory is failing me, is this drug still on

3

the market?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Yes.
All right.

And is it on

the market with a different label?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

It is.

The label changed

8

after Karen Bartlett sustained the injuries that she did

9

in this case.

In fact, that was one of the arguments

10

that -- that at the time, this was before PLIVA, okay?

11

So there was a lot of failure to warn being argued

12

because the regime, as the case came into trial was

13

under Wyeth v. Levine, it was not under the

14

PLIVA v. Mensing case.

15

So Justice Kagan, that's why it's perfectly

16

reasonable for the trial lawyers here to think that the

17

warning is an appropriate thing because this Court's

18

case that had just been decided made that perfectly

19

clear.

21

that the warning would play, appropriately so, under a

strict liability regime.

says that there is nothing under the FDCA to preclude

the State from making a reasonable safety determination

3

that might lead to the withdrawal of the drug.

admittedly, that is a rare circumstance.

5

Now,

And that is not what New Hampshire is doing

6

here, and in his post-trial orders Judge La Plant made

7

clear that is not what New Hampshire is imposing here.

All New Hampshire is imposing here is a duty to pay

compensation if your unreasonably dangerous product

This argument about stopping

No, because the -- the duty

the drug.

to this Court, the only duty that was being litigated

was the duty concerning the warning label.

commerce clause problems and preemption and so forth.

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Breyer, that's not

an impossibility hypothetical.

That's an obstacle

hypothetical.

11

there is no obstacle under the FDCA of having State law

12

remedies to compensate injured patients.

13

And in Wyeth, I think six justices said

So you know, the reason why it's important

14

to keep these concepts of preemption distinct is that

That was not an obstacle

Now, having -- you know, I think gotten a

argument is that simply because the FDA approved the

drug and there would need to be some State law claim

21

22

necessarily would mean that it would be impossible to

23

comply with.

24
25

Because the premise of their

4

their argument is FDA approval über alles.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There
I don't

There is no such thing then

6

as a brand name manufacturer can change some design

7

features of the drug -- you know, without FDA approval

8

or without going back to square one of the FDA, there's

9

nothing like that?

10

MR. FREDERICK:

No, the FDA requires a -- a

11

new drug or an abbreviated drug application, I get the

12

terms of them sometimes confused, but if there was to be

13

a tweak to the design, they'd need to go to the FDA to

14

get approval for that.

15

I want to make one other point, which is

16

that strict liability applies to distributors as well as

17

to manufacturers.

18

distributor can't change the design and it cannot change

19

the label.

20

And so here it seems obvious that a

But under normal principles of strict

21

liability, the idea is that if you are a seller of the

22

product in your normal course and it is a dangerous

23

product that causes somebody to be injured, you can be

24

held liable in strict liability.

25

well settled.

That principle is very

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

And so it would seem odd to suppose that the

2

distributor who has no power to make any change in

conduct that would make the product any safer also gets

to be immunized from suit.

I have no further points unless the Court
