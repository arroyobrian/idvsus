ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRENVILLE CLARK, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:

This is a case about discharging taxes in a

bankruptcy proceeding. 

The Bankruptcy Code provides that income taxes


14

that are more than 3 years old are discharged in a


15

bankruptcy proceeding.

16

Youngs filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding in March of


17

1997, some 3 years, 5 months after they had filed their


18

1992 income tax return in October of 1993.

19

Code provides, on this simple set of facts, that the


20

Youngs' 1992 income tax obligation is discharged.

21

operative code sections are 727, 523, and 507, which I set


22

out at pages 10 and 11 of my brief. 


23
24
25

QUESTION:

In the petitioner's case, the


The Bankruptcy


The


Well, they also filed an earlier


bankruptcy petition, didn't they? 

MR. CLARK:

They did indeed, Your Honor.

That


3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was filed in May of 1996.

2

It lasted just short of 6 months, and the -- the argument


3

that the IRS has tendered in this case and below is that


4

you subtract out the 6 months they are in the prior


5

proceeding from the calculation of the 3 years, 5 months,


6

and when you do that, you come out with the Youngs ending


7

up with being only 2 years 11 months away from the 3-year


8

mark --


9
10
11

QUESTION:

It was a Chapter 13 proceeding. 


Well, why was the first Chapter 13


petition dismissed? 

MR. CLARK:

It was dismissed at the behest of


12

the Youngs for a variety of reasons that did not appear in


13

the record.

14

succeeded in selling their house and paying off mortgages


15

on the house that had -- they had placed on there.

16

on in the proceeding, they had gone through the trouble of


17

engaging special counsel, an attorney Noreen Farr, to do


18

something which does not appear in the record.

19

finally decided that they would dismiss the case rather


20

than go forward with it.

21

do not appear in the record. 


22

During the Chapter 13 proceeding, they had


Later


But they


The reasons that they did not --


They dismissed the case about 3 weeks before


23

they would have gotten to confirmation of their plan,


24

which they had submitted earlier in the case. 


25

QUESTION:

But there was also the fact that they


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- in addition to dismissing the Chapter 13, the day


2

before that order was entered granting the dismissal at


3

their request, they started a new bankruptcy proceeding. 


4

They started a Chapter 7 proceeding, and that way they


5

were able to stretch out the stay of any effort the


6

Government might have made to collect the tax.


7

MR. CLARK:

The -- the bankruptcy -- the Chapter


8

13 bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed.

The final closing


9

order in the case was entered in March of 1997.

The


10

motion that -- or the request, I think, that the Youngs


11

had filed was in October of 1996, October 23, 1996.

12

our position that the automatic stay expired as soon as


13

the case was dismissed and not later when the case was


14

closed a number of months later.

15

significant because in our view the IRS was entitled to


16

restart their enforced collection efforts against the


17

Youngs --


18

QUESTION:

It is


And I think that is


Do you have authority for that, for


19

saying that -- that it's not the date that the bankruptcy


20

was closed, but some -- the earlier date when they -- when


21

they made that motion? 


22
23
24
25

MR. CLARK:

Yes.

It's in the Bankruptcy Code


itself, section 320 -- yes -- I'll have to get the --

QUESTION:

Is the filing of the notice of


dismissal, which was October 23?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. CLARK:

Yes.

It's the filing of the notice


of dismissal, and that we contend is the dismissal. 


3

What happened subsequent to the -- the filing of


4

that notice is the Chapter 13 trustee held some funds that


5

had been paid in.

6

administrative expense, and that was put on for a hearing


7

and eventually it was granted.

8

clerk's office closed the case in March of 1997.

11

He sought to apply for an


QUESTION:

And then thereafter the


Did anyone object to the notice of


dismissal? 

MR. CLARK:

Not in a -- not in a Chapter 13


12

where the debtor seeks dismissal.

13

absolute right to seek dismissal of his Chapter 13 case


14

because it's a voluntary proceeding. 


15

QUESTION:

The debtor has the


You used the term seek dismissal,


16

move to dismiss in October, and then the proceeding was


17

actually dismissed in March.

18

simple motion to dismiss is the same thing as having it


19

dismissed? 


20

MR. CLARK:

Are you saying that your


Yes, I am in this situation, Mr.


21

Chief Justice, because of -- the bankruptcy rules are a


22

little -- were a little vague at that point in time. 


23

Whether you seek a dismissal by simply filing a, quote,


24

request or moving for a dismissal, the rule says that upon


25

a request for dismissal, the judge shall dismiss it.

In


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this particular case, the judge did not actually enter an


2

order of dismissal.

3

entered or requested in October of 1996. 


4
5

QUESTION:

It simply accepted the dismissal as


Well, this whole sequence of events


seems a bit gimmicky.


6

MR. CLARK:

Well, if -- if there are gimmicks,


7

if somebody is trying to manipulate the system, to game


8

the system, certainly the Government -- any party in


9

interest who was affected by the gaming, the manipulation


10

-- can object, can take -- can move to dismiss -- to


11

convert the case, for example, which --

QUESTION:

12
13

faith here, wasn't there? 


14

MR. CLARK:

15

QUESTION:

16

I thought there was a finding of good


Yes, there was, Your Honor. 

Was it a finding of good faith or --


or a finding that he was making no finding of bad faith?

MR. CLARK:

17

No.

The -- the judge below, Judge


18

Vaughn in the Bankruptcy Court, found in favor of the


19

Government, suggesting that there was a potential, in


20

similar cases such as this, for abuse or manipulation by


21

debtors in general.

22

found that he attributes no bad faith to the Youngs in


23

this particular situation, and I think that's an important


24

fact. 


25

But in this case, Judge Vaughn had

QUESTION:

Is it bad faith to look for a tax


2

loophole?

3

attorneys always did. 


4

I think thought that's what all the tax


MR. CLARK:

It's certainly not in our view bad


5

faith to look for a tax -- for a way to get a grant of a


6

discharge of an obligation that you formerly owed.


7

QUESTION:

Do you think that that's what the


8

judge meant -- meant by not attributing bad faith?

9

didn't even think that your client was legitimately trying


10

to take advantage of a tax loophole?

11

I took it to mean. 


12

MR. CLARK:

He


That -- that's what


The case -- Justice Scalia, the case


13

came before the court, before the Bankruptcy Court, on a


14

motion for summary judgment by the motion -- by the


15

Government.

16

other than those that were on summary judgment.

17

what the -- I see Judge Vaughn has -- as finding is that


18

he sees no evidence before the court from which he would


19

infer any manipulative or abusive scheme.


20

The -- there was no findings of fact as such


QUESTION:

The --


Well, would it be manipulative or


21

abusive just to take advantage of the provision of the


22

statute? 


23

MR. CLARK:

24

QUESTION:

25

No, Your Honor, it would not be.

So, the finding doesn't make any


difference one way or the other, does it?

MR. CLARK:

When bankruptcy -- bankruptcy


debtors take advantage --

QUESTION:

You're just saying you have a


statutory right to do what you did. 


5

MR. CLARK:

6

QUESTION:

That's exactly right, Justice --

Why should we read the statute


7

regardless, when it's good faith or bad faith, as allowing


8

the following?

9

a bankrupt filer owes the Government.

We look back 3 years to see how much money


10

to pay it.

11

after a number of years, the first bankruptcy, then brings


12

the second bankruptcy proceeding and says, well, if we


13

look back 3 years from the second one, this $100,000 I


14

owned -- I owed falls outside that period.

15

windfall to him because he brought two bankruptcy


16

proceedings rather than one, and it's a loss to the


17

Government for no reason other than his having brought two


18

bankruptcy proceedings rather than one.

19

purpose whatsoever that I can fathom in the bankruptcy


20

statute, and what purpose is there in reading the statute


21

to permit such a result? 


22

Let's say it's $100,000.

He's going to have


MR. CLARK:

He dismisses that


It's simply a


It serves no


Justice Breyer, you would have to


23

look at what happened in the prior bankruptcy I think to


24

see why the debtor was able to stay in bankruptcy for the


25

length of time that the debtor did and thereby supposedly

Alderson Reporting Company

prevent the Government from collecting taxes from the

debtor.

A chapter -- usually the prior bankruptcy is a

Chapter 11.

had a long life, the debtor had to propose a plan that had


7

to pay the taxes that the debtor owed in full over the


8

life of a plan, whether that be 3 years, 4 years, 5 years,


9

whatever it was.

During the Chapter 13 proceeding, that had --


The plan has to go to confirmation.

10

the plan is confirmed, all the plan payments that have


11

accumulated to that point are now paid out to the


12

They make payments for 3 years and then they

That is their right to -- to dismiss.


QUESTION:

21

Do they get the payments back if


they --

MR. CLARK:

No.

No, Your Honor, they do not. 


24

The -- the plan payments have been paid to the Government


25

all throughout the 3-year period.

They have a confirmed

including the Government. 


4

Once you have confirmation, the confirmation order


QUESTION:

How much of the -- how much of the


5

tax liability did the Government receive during the course


6

of the first bankruptcy?


7

MR. CLARK:

In the Youngs' case, the Government


8

did not receive any payments whatsoever.

The Youngs'


9

Chapter 13 lasted about -- just short of 6 months.

They


10

had not filed that tax case, that Chapter 13 until 2 and a


11

half years after they had filed their tax return.

12

but they did not receive any payment because we did not


13

get to confirmation in the Youngs' case.


14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CLARK:

They --


Did you -- did you seek confirmation?

The confirmation hearing had been


16

set by the court at the outset of the case, and it was


17

scheduled for November 15 of --


18

QUESTION:

But it was -- it was the debtors'


19

voluntary action that stopped the Government from getting


20

any payments under that plan. 


21

MR. CLARK:

22

yes, Your Honor --

QUESTION:

24

MR. CLARK:

25

It was -- in this particular case,


Could the judge --

1

QUESTION:

When the debtor asked to have the


2

Chapter 13 dismissed, could the judge have said, I will


3

enter the dismissal order, the closure order, but only on


4

condition that you do not attempt to assert a time bar,


5

should you -- as everybody knew was -- that was going to


6

happen, go into a successive bankruptcy proceeding?

7

-- would the judge have any authority to do that?


8
9

MR. CLARK:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

Did


Under, I


think it's section 349 of the Bankruptcy Code which


10

governs dismissals, the judge certainly has the authority


11

to put conditions upon the issuance of the dismissal.

QUESTION:

12

Well, then why is the dismissal


13

automatic, which is what we talked about at the very


14

first?


15

MR. CLARK:

Well, because the debtor -- I think


16

the procedural problem here is because the request -- the


17

rules, at least at the point of this request for dismissal


18

was -- was made, were a little vague as to how you request


19

or move for a dismissal.


20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CLARK:

22
23

All right. 

But the debtor has the absolute


right to request the dismissal. 

The effect of the dismissal the judge can impose


24

a condition on to say, well, yes, we're going to dismiss


25

the case, but we're going to enter an order that says you


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cannot count the 6 months that the Youngs were in


2

bankruptcy.


3

QUESTION:

Well, the debtor -- the debtor has a


4

right to reject that condition and say, if that's the


5

condition, I don't want to dismiss, I assume.

6

that's so, then the dismissal is not automatic.

7

you can't have it both ways. 


8

MR. CLARK:

9

QUESTION:

And if

I mean,


I don't -- I think the --

If he has a right to reject that


10

condition, then once you say the judge may impose a


11

condition, you have to say that -- that dismissal does not


12

occur automatically once you request it.


13

MR. CLARK:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CLARK:

I think in that --

You can't have it both ways. 

I -- I'm not saying it's -- I think


16

what I'm saying is that the court has the ability to put a


17

condition on it.

18

wish to accept it, it's going to have to withdraw the


19

motion to dismiss. 


20

If the judge -- if the debtor doesn't


QUESTION:

Right, and we don't know, until the


21

judge enters an order of dismissal, whether he's going to


22

put a condition on it.

23

is automatic as soon as you request it?


24
25

MR. CLARK:

So, how can you say the dismissal


I'm saying it's -- Justice Scalia,


I'm saying it's automatic in the sense that the -- the


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

debtor has an absolute right, quote/unquote -- and that's


2

not an absolutely absolute, but the debtor has a right


3

under Chapter 13 to have his case dismissed.


4

QUESTION:

No, but -- no, but you say he doesn't


5

because the judge can say, I'll let you dismiss it if. 


6

Whereupon, the debtor can say no -- no deal.

7

an absolute right. 


8

MR. CLARK:

9

So, it's not


Well, it's -- I think it is an


absolute right or nearly so.

I don't think that putting a


10

condition on it makes it less of -- of an absolute right


11

to dismiss. 

QUESTION:

12

But it doesn't mean that you can't


13

equate the date that you file the motion to dismiss with


14

the termination of the Chapter 13.

15

judge could put a condition on it, then the -- the 13


16

proceeding doesn't terminate until the closure order is


17

entered.

MR. CLARK:

18

It can't be.

If the


I think the -- well, I don't know


19

that the judge could withhold or -- or delay the entry of


20

a dismissal order.

21

the time in Chapter 13 won't count against the --


22
23
24
25

It could put a condition on it that


QUESTION:

Let's say we disagree with you and we


QUESTION:

Have you cited any cases in which


find --


this kind of condition was imposed?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. CLARK:

I do not know of any cases where, in


a Chapter 13, a condition has been imposed. 


3

QUESTION:

So, this is totally speculative,


4

really, I think.

5

has occurred as many times as the Government says it has,


6

and if the solution that you suggest is available, I would


7

have thought some judge would have thought of it. 


8
9

I would assume if the -- if this problem


MR. CLARK:

Well, I think no -- no judge is


going to impose the condition I think under section 349


10

unless the IRS comes in and makes a motion or brings it to


11

the attention of the court that --

QUESTION:

12
13

But then the lawyers have never had


enough sense to do this, as I understand it. 


14

(Laughter.) 


15

MR. CLARK:

Well, they've gone a -- the


16

Government I think has gone on a different track on -- on


17

this issue. 


18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CLARK:

20

QUESTION:

The answer is no.

The answer is no, Your Honor. 

In -- in all events, let's assume


21

that we think that the dismissal occurs in -- it would be


22

March 13.

23

make a difference in this case?


Does the difference between October and March


24

MR. CLARK:

25

QUESTION:

No, it does not, Your Honor. 

All right.

So, it doesn't make any


15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

difference. 

MR. CLARK:

This -- we got into this in the


3

court of appeals a little bit, but it really makes no


4

difference whatsoever in the computation. 


5

QUESTION:

Mr. Clark, can I get your


6

understanding of what you think would be manipulation? 


7

Because it may have something to do with my view of -- of


8

this case.

9

into a Chapter 13 proceeding with the -- with the avowed


You don't assert that -- that somebody can go


10

intent of not carrying it through to completion and of


11

12

the shorter lookback.

the court? 


19

I ask the court to

-- I agree with you, Judge Scalia.

21

abuse of the bankruptcy process. 

QUESTION:

Isn't that a fraud on


I would -- I would never -- I would


20

22

I have no


It would be a -- an


And if that were shown, I suppose


23

there's no doubt that the -- that the Bankruptcy Court in


24

the later proceeding could disallow the -- the shortening


25

of the lookback period because of that fraud.

1

MR. CLARK:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor. 

Okay.

So, we're talking here only


3

about cases in which someone in good faith, at least as


4

far as the IRS can approve, commences a 13 proceeding, and


5

then for -- for some -- some plausible, good reason,


6

before it is concluded, dismisses.

7

MR. CLARK:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CLARK:

10

QUESTION:

Is that how you --


Yes.

-- understand the situation?

Yes, it is. 

Whose burden is it to show that there


11

was some reason other than just getting advantage of the


12

automatic stay?

13

show that?

14

Scalia's question -- that there should be a fact question


15

in every case as just what was the motivation of the


16

petitioner who file the Chapter 13 proceeding. 


Do you have to put in any evidence to


I mean, you're suggesting -- I guess Justice


MR. CLARK:

there were no confirmation order entered prior to the

QUESTION:

MR. CLARK:

QUESTION:

Right, as was the case here.

As was the case here.

Yes.


So, presumably


18

even if something had been paid in for the taxes, they


19

would have been given back on the dismissal.


20

MR. CLARK:

Yes.

The magic moment in Chapter 13

is the entry of the confirmation order, and once the

confirmation order is entered, whatever plan payments the

QUESTION:

Well, why -- why do you think it's


improper to equitably toll that lookback period for this

1
2

situation? 

MR. CLARK:

I -- I do not think it is proper at


3

all to -- I -- there are several reasons why I think it's


4

improper. 


5

First of all, the language of the statute itself


6

is very plain and straightforward and has no provision for


7

equitable tolling or any tolling. 


8
9

QUESTION:

applies in similar statutes which have no provision for


10

equitable tolling. 


11

MR. CLARK:

12
13

We have held that equitable tolling


Yes, I'm -- I -- I know that the --


I know that you have, Mr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I thought your point is --


14

one of your points was that statutes of limitations are


15

different from this, that this is not a statute of


16

limitations. 


17

MR. CLARK:

It's -- my point is that it is --


18

this is a part of the definition of which taxes can be


19

discharged in bankruptcy.

20

to defining which taxes can be discharged in bankruptcy. 


21

There is this 3-year lookback period.

22

period where a taxpayer has filed a return late and then


23

we go to a 2-year lookback.

24

day period that the taxpayer/debtor must satisfy and that


25

is 240 days from the date of assessment.

There are several time elements


There is a 2-year


And then there's a third 240-


Now, the debtor


20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

must meet all three of these to be able to discharge the


2

taxes. 


3

In the Youngs' case, the taxes were assessed


4

promptly, about 2 and a half months after they filed their


5

tax return.

6

not file a late return because they got extensions to file


7

their return in October of 1993.

8

doesn't apply.

9

particular case then is the 3-year, and how do you measure


They clearly met that one.

The -- they did


So, they -- that one


And the only one in question in this


10

3 years and do you toll the 3 years for the period of the


11

prior Chapter 13.

QUESTION:

12

Mr. Clark, is the Government correct


13

in -- in pointing out that the debtor here could, instead


14

of seeking dismissal of the 13 and starting a 7, simply


15

have moved to convert the 13 into a 7?

16

MR. CLARK:

17

QUESTION:

Is that correct?


That is correct, Your Honor. 

If -- if the debtor had done that,


18

the 3-year period would continue to have been calculated


19

as it originally was under the Chapter 13 proceeding. 

MR. CLARK:

20
21
22

Yes, Justice Souter, that is


correct.

QUESTION:

Would -- would it have been error if


23

-- if the judge or any judge in a case like this, when --


24

when confronted with a motion or a request to dismiss,


25

simply questioned the debtor whether it was the debtor's


21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

intent to start a Chapter 7 proceeding, and if the answer


2

was yes, for the judge simply to say, well, I will treat


3

your motion as a motion for a conversion and we'll grant


4

that?

5

Would that have been error on the judge's part?

MR. CLARK:

I think it would be error for a


6

judge to take a motion to dismiss a Chapter 13 and make it


7

a chapter -- and say, we are going to make it instead a


8

Chapter 7 case. 


9

QUESTION:

Even when the debtor says, yes, my


10

plan, my intent is to -- is to initiate Chapter 7


11

proceedings. 


12

MR. CLARK:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

Justice Souter --


The -- I take it the only harm to the


14

debtor in that case would simply be the -- the argument


15

about the 3-year lookback because the debtor would be


16

getting exactly otherwise exactly what the debtor wanted,


17

i.e., a Chapter 7 filing.


18

MR. CLARK:

Yes, Justice Souter.

But keep in


19

mind in the -- in the case of either dismissal or


20

conversion, in the example in the Government's brief, the


21

-- it does not do any good to seek conversion -- I'm sorry


22

-- to dismiss and then refile unless you're toward the end


23

of the 3-year period in any event.

24

is dismissed, now the 3-year period has expired, and now


25

you go the next day and you file your Chapter 7, saying,


So that when the case

Alderson Reporting Company

1

well, I've been -- it's been now more than 3 years since


2

the filing of the return.


3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CLARK:

Yes.

But in the meantime, of course, the


5

plan payments are being made, hopefully, to the Government


6

and to other creditors for the 2 years and however many


7

months. 


8
9

QUESTION:

Well, that -- that's so.

But, I


mean, even in the case in which there has been a


10

confirmation under -- under the Chapter 13 and plan


11

payments have been made, it may very well be that the


12

amount of tax liability that has actually been paid could


13

be minuscule, so that it would be very much in the


14

debtor's interest to -- to start a new Chapter 7 and save


15

whatever the balance due is on the taxes. 

MR. CLARK:

16

Well, except that, Justice Souter,


17

the problem is that the tax payments are not going to be


18

minuscule during the Chapter 13.

QUESTION:

19

Well, whether they're minuscule or


20

not, if they're not 100 percent, the debtor still gains


21

something by going -- so far as the Federal taxes are


22

concerned, by dismissing and starting a Chapter 7 because


23

whatever the balance due is, in -- on the facts of a case


24

like this, the -- the debtor is going to -- going to


25

obtain. 


23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLARK:

That is correct, Justice Souter. 


2

But again, I would point to the fact that the Government


3

is getting something.

4

And in tax collection in general, apart from bankruptcy,


5

even when bankruptcy is not in the picture at all, the way


6

the Government is trying to collect taxes is through


7

installment payments as the Youngs --


8
9

QUESTION:

It may not get the whole amount. 


Well, that's right.

But I think the


Government's answer to that is unless we, in fact, make a


10

compromise agreement, we're entitled to 100 cents on the


11

dollar.

12

may get 50 cents on the dollar before you go from 13 to 7


13

I -- I don't think really disparages the Government's


14

argument any. 


15
16

And the -- the fact that -- that the Government

Government got nothing. 


17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CLARK:

19
20

Or it can be, as it was here, the


The Government got nothing.

The Government did get nothing in


this situation, Justice Ginsburg, for the 6 months.

QUESTION:

And would there -- in -- in this very


21

case where the Chapter 7 was started the day before the


22

Chapter 13 was closed, was there any advantage, other than


23

wiping out the lookback period, to instituting two


24

proceedings rather than having the 13 converted to a 7?


25

MR. CLARK:

Well, the reason the Chapter 7 was


24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

filed was because I think other creditors were descending


2

upon the Youngs.

3

in October, and that, of course, put everybody back into


4

the status quo ante, except with respect to the sale of


5

their house, of course.

6

once the case has been dismissed, to come forward again.


7
8
9
10

They had dismissed their Chapter 13 back


QUESTION:

But the creditors now were free,


Well, we're getting into filing


versus dismissal.

MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

Yes. 

But if -- if we take the order of the


11

court as what counts, there wouldn't have been any period


12

in which other creditors could have jumped in because the


13

Chapter 13 hadn't yet been closed. 


14

So, from the point of view of the debtors here,


15

was there any advantage that they gained other than wiping


16

out the lookback period? 


17

MR. CLARK:

With -- with the filing of the


18

Chapter 13, they obviously gained the advantage also of


19

eliminating their other debts.


20

QUESTION:

I mean, when they got to the point of


21

saying we're not going to make it under this plan, so


22

we're going to have to quit the 13, at that point they


23

could have done -- either asked for conversion to 7 or


24

started a new proceeding.

25

their viewpoint other than they'd get the benefit under a


Is there any difference from

Alderson Reporting Company

1

reading of the statute of putting the Government out of


2

the picture because the 3-year lookback has run?


3

MR. CLARK:

I'm not quite sure I understand the


4

question, that they -- Justice Ginsburg.

I think they --


5

they get the -- when they -- when they dismiss and then


6

refile, they obviously get the benefit of discharging


7

their other taxes in -- their other debts, non-tax debts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT


11

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES


12
13

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

I would like to address first the -- there's


14
15

been some discussion about protections that maybe or maybe


16

could not occur in a Chapter 13 proceeding to prevent the


17

-- the Government from losing its claim.

18

that rarely, if ever, is capable of happening because we


19

don't know -- debtors don't telegraph to us at the time


20

they're in Chapter 13 or dismissing their Chapter 13 --


21

that they plan to file a second bankruptcy.

22

don't know that's going to happen, you can't prove bad


23

faith.

24

virtually impossible to do that.

bankruptcy judge to inquire and -- and say if -- if that


2

is the plan, Your Honor, we -- we request that it not be


3

dismissed but rather converted. 


4

MS. MILLETT:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

I think --


Or that that be a condition of -- of


the dismissal that you not -- that you not refile.

MS. MILLETT:

I think there's two difficulties


8

with that approach, and the first that it would be an


9

enormous burden in every Chapter 13 case that is filed and


10

then sought to be dismissed -- and an awful lot -- the


11

vast majority are -- to have that inquiry undertaken. 


12

And secondly, there is -- there is no authority


13

under the code that we're aware of that allows a court to


14

condition -- a voluntary dismissal, which they have as of


15

right, on willingness to forego a discharge in a future


16

bankruptcy proceeding. 


17

QUESTION:

But, I mean, let's assume someone has


18

in all good faith commenced a Chapter 13 and has in all


19

good faith dismissed it because, part the way through it,


20

said, you know, I think I can make it on my own now, and


21

-- and then, you know, sometime after that, decides, no, I


22

can't make it and -- and files another bankruptcy


23

proceeding under 7.

24

to alter the 3-year lookback in the statute to make it --


25

to make it what?

No bad faith.

You would still want


5 years or whatever.

QUESTION:

This is not equitable tolling in --

Justice Scalia, for -- for -- in two ways.

First of all,


21

there are two -- there are two aspects to the priority. 


22

There's a priority as against other creditors, but what is


23

at issue here, and again what is at issue in virtually all


24

of these Chapter 7 cases, or these no -- no-asset Chapter

5

discharges the general creditors' claims.

6

is thrown into that pot instead of having the preferred

statute of limitations, but the rationale the Court


4

applied was looking to the treatment of proofs of claim in


5

the Bankruptcy Code, and that was the analogy that


6

Congress was drawing at the time it enacted the Trading


7

with the Enemy statute, and that those proofs of claim --


8

it was in the bankruptcy context --


9

QUESTION:

Maybe, but Trading with the Enemy


10

statute itself contained what was a statute of


11

limitations, and in the case at hand, we were equitably


12

tolling what was effectively a statute of limitations.


13

What's your other best case? 


14

MS. MILLETT:

And Nassau Smelting v. Refining


15

Works, which is discussed in Honda v. Clark, was a


16

bankruptcy case where the proof of claim was not filed


17

until a year after the deadline and the Court allowed


18

participation nonetheless.

19

the proof of claim that's --


20

QUESTION:

And again, it's the nature of


Those are also -- the difficult issue


21

I think in this case is exactly what Justice Scalia has


22

been saying, that this isn't a traditional statute of


23

limitations.

24

either have to say the word 3 years shall be read 3 years


25

plus days tolled.

You have to do one of two things.

That's one thing you could do.

You


Or the


33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

second thing you could do is you could look to 105(a) and


2

you could say that the order that can be issued is an


3

order pay money -- this is in the section 7 -- pay money


4

as if this were the section 13 that hadn't been dismissed.


5

Now, both of those, the question would be, does


6

-- does the judge have the authority to do that?

And


7

looking simply to statute of limitations provisions


8

doesn't answer that question.

9

question.

It -- it provokes the


It proves you might be right, but -- but the


10

worrying thing is whether you can just stick those words


11

in, either plus days tolled, or read 105(a) in so broad a


12

manner. 


13
14
15

So, those are the -- I'd like to know what

should we do and what's the authority for that. 

MS. MILLETT:

To take the first -- the first --


16

first scenario first, the proposition for reading the


17

3-year lookback period as 3 years plus --


18

QUESTION:

Plus days tolled. 


19

MS. MILLETT:

3 years plus.

In deciding what


20

the character of the lookback period is, whether it's akin


21

to the statute of --


22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Could you speak up a little bit, Ms.


Millett? 

MS. MILLETT:

In deciding what the -- the


character of the lookback period is, equitable tolling


34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

does apply in Zipes in filing a proof of -- filing of a


2

claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 


3

There the Court described it as similar to a statute of


4

limitations, but it was not a statute of limitations.

5

equitable tolling does not require --


6

QUESTION:

7

MS. MILLETT:

8
9

So,


Which case was that? 

Zipes v. TW -- Trans World


Airlines.

That does not require the presence in the actual


10

statute of limitations.

11

the question is whether Congress would have intended that


12

type of time limit to be subject to tolling principles. 


13

And the -- we can either assume the lookback period would


14

have for many of the policy reasons that have been


15

discussed -- the -- the conclusion that results if we


16

decide that it is not something that Congress would have


17

intended to be subject to equitable tolling is that the


18

3-year lookback period is an empty gesture as far as


19

protecting the Government.

20

QUESTION:

It has to be a time limit.

If


The Congress --


You have no problem convincing me


21

about what I'd call the equitable merits of your side. 


22

The problem you have, as far as I'm concerned, is how to


23

work, which route do we take and what's the authority for


24

doing it, just what I asked in the first place. 


25

MS. MILLETT:

And that is I think -- and it's


35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

both prongs of your -- of your question.

2

think that the nature of the time limitation is


3

sufficiently similar within the bankruptcy context.

4

is how you enforce claims within the bankruptcy context. 


5

QUESTION:

It is -- we


This


Well, I don't think it is similar.

I


6

-- I -- I mean, the only thing -- the only respect in


7

which it's similar is that it involves time, but all of


8

the other cases that -- that you refer us to, the statute


9

of limitations proper, Zipes, they're all cases in which


10

action by the party seeking to enforce something is


11

limited by a period of time.

12

certain time or else it's no good.

13

it proof of claim or anything else, that's -- that's the


14

scenario. 


15

He has to do it within a

Now, whether you call


In this case, it's -- it's not a matter of


16

whether the Government has filed in time at all.

This


17

lookback is quite a -- quite a different animal.

It's how


18

far back you -- you can go in -- in deciding which claims


19

cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. 


20

Now, it involves time.

I guess, if you think


21

that's enough of a commonality, then -- then I'd agree,


22

but gee, I -- I don't think that's enough to -- to make me


23

think that we have the -- the authority by long tradition


24

to rewrite a statute so that where it says 3 months, it's


25

going to be 3 months -- 3 years, it's going to be on our


36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

authority 3 years plus some other period of time.

MS. MILLETT:

I think this is exactly the


3

situation that you described.

It's like a typical statute


4

of limitations, and that is unless the Government takes


5

action within 3 years to enforce its claim, unless it acts


6

within those 3 years, it will, for all intents and


7

purposes and all practical purposes, within the unique


8

context of bankruptcy proceedings, have no claim left.

9

will be discharged.

10

QUESTION:

It


There's nothing --

But it's not a limitation on the


11

Government's action within 3 -- it doesn't say the


12

Government has to act within 3 years.

13

have a bankruptcy proceeding, you look back only 3 years. 


14

It has nothing to do with how soon the Government has to


15

come forward.

16

over that lookback.


17
18
19

It says when you


The Government has absolutely no control


QUESTION:

If the Government comes forward after


3 years, it loses. 

MS. MILLETT:

That's right.

It eliminates --


20

and the legislative history describes this quite -- from


21

Congress' vantage point that this was an enforcement


22

period, a collection time, and that -- that if the -- it


23

would eliminate stale claims, which this Court said in


24

Zipes is one of the purposes of a statute of limitations. 


25

It would -- it would extinguish liability if the


37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government doesn't act within the particular period of


2

time, which again is akin to a traditional statute of


3

limitations.

4

The --


QUESTION:

I have one -- one technical question. 


5

I should know the answer.

6

proceeding is commenced, the Government says, oh, we've


7

got a lot of taxes here and this debtor may file Chapter


8

13.

9

somehow protects you? 


10

Suppose before the Chapter 13


Can you file a lien against his property which


MS. MILLETT:

If we -- if we have assessed the


11

taxes, which in itself requires a 90-day period as a


12

matter of law, but if we have assessed the taxes, which we


13

had here, we can go file a notice of federal tax lien


14

which would protect us. 


15

What happened in this case --


16

QUESTION:

17

MS. MILLETT:

And that would protect you.

That would protect us, but it's


18

important to keep in mind how tax collection works.

19

IRS, as a matter of policy and as a matter of some


20

statutory provisions, tends not to descend immediately


21

upon taxpayers the second there's a liability. 


22

The


In this case, we had been working with the


23

Youngs, and they had been making some payments.

And it's


24

routine for us to try voluntary compliance.

25

policy and that's what we do, and it wasn't -- we tried


It's good

to --


2

QUESTION:

If you -- if you imposed a lien,


3

could you still work with the taxpayer?

4

prohibit you from trying to work it out, does it?


5

MS. MILLETT:

The lien doesn't


We -- we could have, but it


6

certainly has some consequences for -- for the taxpayer. 


7

And -- and again we -- we try -- we try to work these


8

things out without going to that sort of adversarial level


9

of proceedings.

10

And there had been payments being made


here.


11

But if I could get back to Justice Breyer's --


12

QUESTION:

13

And just -- just so I get the


technical --


14

MS. MILLETT:

15

QUESTION:

16

But once the Chapter 13 proceeding


commences, you --


17

MS. MILLETT:

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. MILLETT:

20

Sure. 


We cannot impose --


-- cannot impose a lien.

Absolutely not.

That's part of


the automatic stay. 

If I could get back to Justice Breyer's


21
22

question.

What we think is important here is -- is the --


23

the combination of the two factors that you discussed is


24

that this is sufficiently like a statute of limitations,


25

and Congress intended it to operate like a statute of


39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

limitations, and it does operate like a statute of


2

limitations within the bankruptcy context.

3

combined that with the unique equitable powers the


4

bankruptcy courts have and the unique operation of


5

equitable principles within the bankruptcy context.

6

it's not an either/or.

7

is a sufficient reason as to why tolling of this lookback


8

period would be appropriate. 


9

QUESTION:

And we've


So,


I think the combination of those


Ms. Millett, Mr. Clark said in his


10

brief that, well, if you're going to do this for taxes,


11

the same logic would apply to wage claims that have a


12

priority.

13

Is that -- is that so?


14
15

What else did he say?

MS. MILLETT:

Employee benefit claims. 


Those are the only two nontax


provisions that have these type of --


16

QUESTION:

So, could you --


17

MS. MILLETT:

-- lookback periods.

And I -- I'm


18

assuming that it would, in fact, apply.

19

analyzed -- the same analysis would apply and assuming


20

that the same congressional purpose would be shown and the


21

consistency of congressional purpose to apply equitable


22

tolling -- it would apply there. 


23

I -- I haven't


It doesn't actually happen to be a problem in


24

that area because those -- for two reasons.

Those types


25

of -- those two claims involve very, very short time

1

limits, 90 and 180 days, not 3 years.

2

avail themselves of this procedural roundabout, they would


3

have to file two bankruptcy proceedings very closely on


4

top of each other, and that just doesn't happen. 


5

QUESTION:

6

MS. MILLETT:

And so, in order to


Well, as they did here. 

No.

I mean, they would have to


7

file their first one, and then within 3 months to get out


8

of the 90 days, you'd have to file another one.

9

the first one lasted I guess approximately 6 months. 


10

QUESTION:

11

pending to do what?

Ms. Millett, there is legislation

How is it drafted?


MS. MILLETT:

12

This --


It -- it is drafted to provide for


13

tolling of the lookback period during the pendency of --


14

during the time an automatic stay in a prior bankruptcy


15

case.

QUESTION:

16
17
18

As an amendment to section 105 or


what?

MS. MILLETT:

I think it's to section 507, which


19

is -- 507(a)(8), which is what provides the lookback


20

period itself.

21
22

But that legislation --


QUESTION:

Is it part of the overall Bankruptcy


Code revision?

MS. MILLETT:

It is.

It has not been --


You know, the big bill.

MS. MILLETT:

Which may or may not go.

are -- there is -- there are, you know, different bills

They've both been passed.

They aren't fighting over this


I also think it's important to keep in mind what

-- what we would have to assume Congress intended were we


10

to read the lookback period as something not subject to


11

tolling.

12

people like to avail themselves of tax loopholes.

13

usually done to decide how much taxes you owe. 


14

Now, there have been some suggestions that

That's


What we're talking about here is an admitted


15

acknowledged tax liability that they want to get out of


16

paying and that -- that we want to hold that -- that

debtor --


18

QUESTION:

Well, if you were the lawyer for the


19

Government faced with a taxpayer that had a big tax


20

liability and it looked like bankruptcy might be looming,


21

what would you advise the Government to do?


22

MS. MILLETT:

Depending on this Court's holding,


23

there -- I have to say in all candor the volume -- the


24

sheer volume of cases that the IRS handles in bankruptcy


25

makes much -- and it's handled often at the initial


42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

stages, as it was here, not by lawyers, but by special


2

agents in the bankruptcy proceeding.

3

have to go to a system where we would go to the tax liens

immediately, but that's not what --

QUESTION:

I think we would


No doubt, but absence that, what is


6

the best way for the Government to protect itself, do you

think?

as they assess, immediately file a tax lien.

that's -- normally we go -- there are administrative --


11

other administrative means of collection.

12

things out.

13

reason that Congress would have intended our tax system to


14

go that way and to be driven by these bankruptcy

procedures. 


We have offers in compromise, and there's no
