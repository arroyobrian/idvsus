CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in Case 08-267, United States v. Denedo.

5

Mr. Shah.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SHAH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,

11

or CAAF, held that military appellate courts possess

12

open-ended jurisdiction under the All Writs Act to

13

entertain a coram nobis challenge to the merits of a

14

final court-martial conviction.

15

reverse that decision, both because the All Writs Act

16

cannot supply jurisdiction that Congress chose not to

17

confer and because Respondent is a civilian who may no

18

longer invoke the military court system.

19

This Court should

As this Court explained in Clinton v.

20

Goldsmith, military courts, as Article I courts, are

21

strictly limited to the bases of jurisdiction conferred

22

upon them by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or

23

UCMJ.

24

it does not confer jurisdiction over Respondent's coram

25

nobis petition.

Three related aspects of the UCMJ make clear that

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

First, as noted in Goldsmith, the UCMJ

2

narrowly circumscribes military appellate jurisdiction

3

to the findings and sentences of a court-martial

4

conviction.

5

Articles 66 and 67, which define appellate jurisdiction,

6

do not contemplate any further review within the

7

military appellate courts.

8
9

That is a direct review jurisdiction.

UCMJ

Second, once direct appellate review is
complete and the military authority executes the

10

judgment, UCMJ Article 76 affirmatively forecloses any

11

further military court review.

12

recognized on two prior occasions, UCMJ Article 76 marks

13

the terminal point of proceedings within the

14

court-martial system.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As this Court has

Mr. Shah, how does that

16

differ from the general rule that a judgment becomes

17

final and has preclusive effect once the appellate route

18

has been exhausted or the time to pursue it has expired?

19

It seems to me that Article 76 simply codifies the rule

20

that applies ordinarily in criminal cases, in civil

21

cases, stating when a judgment becomes final for

22

preclusion purposes.

23

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, yes, Article 76 does

24

that, but it does more than that.

25

recognized in Gusik and in Councilman, it marks the end

As this Court

of proceedings within the military court system.
Now, beyond the text, what this Court looked

3

at in Gusik -- in Gusik, it was a Petitioner seeking

4

habeas review.

5

Gusik was that Article 76 essentially violated the

6

Suspension Clause because it -- it marked the end of -

7

no further proceedings within the military court system

8

as well as within the Article III court system.

9

Court agreed with the Petitioner that Article 76 marked

One of his alternative arguments in

The

10

the end of any further proceedings within the military

11

court system.

12

repeal of Article III habeas jurisdiction, but there was

13

no disagreement between the Petitioner, the government,

14

and this Court in Gusik that it did mark the end of

15

proceedings within the military court system.

16
17
18

It disagreed that it also effected a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So therefore one could say

that that point wasn't decided in the case, right?
MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, one could say

19

that, but this Court again in Councilman ratified that

20

line that the Court drew in Gusik.

21

the reasoning that Article 76 forecloses any further

22

proceedings within the military court system.

23

don't think it's just dicta.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where in your view, in

2

that the government is putting forward, can this -- can

Denedo go?

4

never would have entered a plea if I had known I would

5

be subject to deportation.

6

out about it until what, 8 years later, when the

7

government -- 8 years after his conviction, the

8

government said, you're subject to deportation.

9

can he go with that plea?

10

He said, I was misinformed by my counsel.

MR. SHAH:

I

And he said, I never found

Where

Your Honor, it appears that

11

Respondent no longer has any further remedies to -- to

12

pursue.

13

general -- in the general case, Petitioner is bringing

14

-- the exact same claim the Respondent is bringing is

15

normally going to have several avenues of remedy outside

16

--

17

But we think the important point is that in a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We're assuming now,

18

because we haven't gone any further than his plea, that

19

he was so misinformed and he didn't lack diligence in

20

failing to bring it earlier, that he was surprised by

21

the government's action, so he was unaware and,

22

therefore, unable to make this plea any earlier.

have given us the answer that it's too bad, he's just

24

out of any court.

25

MR. SHAH:

You

Well, Your Honor, I think it's
6


Alderson Reporting Company

1

important to note that the UCMJ marks the high-water

2

mark of process within the military justice system.

3

What the UCMJ did is it took the prior system, which

4

didn't even allow for real direct review within the

5

military court system, and it made that direct review

system much more robust.

Well, part -- part of

independence is the assurance that the court has the

ability to do justice in the case before it, and I think

the purpose of coram nobis or coram vobis is to protect

19

the integrity of the court, and that's all this court is

20

asking.

21

just said.

22

So that's quite consistent with what you've

MR. SHAH:

Well -- well, Your Honor, in

23

enacting the UCMJ, Congress was balancing several

values.

3

mindful of the military's primary mission in fighting

4

wars and defending the nation.

5

Now, given those competing values, it was -

6

it was reasonable for Congress to draw a line at some

7

point and say it, the conviction is final and to the

8

extent you want to seek further collateral review you

9

have to go to the civilian system to seek that review.

historical standpoint, but also from a practical

standpoint, given the institutional limitations -

He was convicted in what, was it -

MR. SHAH:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

And the government

10

never said anything about deportation until 2006?

11

they went through -- he twice applied for

12

naturalization, is that correct?

13

MR. SHAH:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

That is correct, Your Honor.
And he was turned down on

15

grounds that had nothing to do with deportation.

16

government never alerted him to the possibility that he

17

would be deportable.

18

with no hint of that, and you say that he is -- he's out

19

of time, but nothing counts against the government

20

because of that 8-year lapse?

21

The

They turned down his application

MR. SHAH:

Right.

Your Honor, in the

22

denials I agree with you that they did not alert him to

23

deportation, but it based its denials on his military

24

court convictions.

25

notice that the military court convictions were posing a

So to that extent he was somewhat on

status.

3

Now, it is true, you're absolutely right,

4

that the government did not begin deportation

5

proceedings until October 2006, and until that time he

6

was not on notice, but the fact that this particular

7

claimant -- that the time has run should not be

8

dispositive.

For example -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the time -- I mean,

10

the time may very well run in the civil system, and yet

11

I take it that under -- you accept Morgan and in the

this Petitioner could seek coram nobis.

MR. SHAH:

Right.

There are two reasons,

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

isn't the kind of the most reasonable way to construe

2

the statute, including Article 76, as allowing for this?

3

MR. SHAH:

No, Your Honor.

Mr. Taft's

testimony that you're referring to was not given at the

5

time of enacting of the UCMJ.

That was during a subsequent

amending process of the act.

What was the occasion for

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What were they amending at

the time?

12

MR. SHAH:

13

the 1983 amendments to the UCMJ.

14

several -

15

It was I think it was in terms of

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There have been

You're way ahead of me

16

because I don't know what the '83 amendments would refer

17

to.

18

What was the subject matter?
MR. SHAH:

Okay.

Well, what Mr. Taft was

19

testifying to, we believe, are -- he was -- the specific

20

testimony that Mr. Taft was giving was related to the

21

boards of correction, I believe, and whether that the

22

boards of correction should retain jurisdiction review

23

of final court-martial judgments, so his testimony was

24

related to that distinct issue.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, with respect to the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

boards of correction, I take it there's nothing

2

specifically in the statute that says there's coram

3

nobis jurisdiction?

4

MR. SHAH:

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. SHAH:

7

Yes.

There's nothing specific in the

UCMJ -

8
9

Nothing specific in the UCMJ?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, if he was right about

that, that would undercut your argument that, with

10

respect to a special court-martial and subsequent

11

proceedings, there could be no coram nobis because

12

there's no specific reference in the statute in either

13

case?

14

MR. SHAH:

No, Your Honor.

What Mr. Taft

15

was testifying to was the state of the prevailing law in

16

1983 before the CAAF.

17

amend the UCMJ in light of Mr. Taft's testimony -- this

18

Court has said on multiple occasions that we don't read

19

into congressional silence -

20

The fact that Congress did not

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, I quite agree.

The

21

premise of my -- sort of my argument to you a second ago

22

was that if we accept the proposition that Mr. Taft was

23

making a correct statement of law -

24

MR. SHAH:

Right.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- then the logic would in

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effect answer your argument that because there is no

2

specific grant of coram nobis jurisdiction with respect

3

to special court-martials and subsequent proceedings,

4

there couldn't be any.

5

trying to make.

6

MR. SHAH:

That's the only point that I was

Your Honor, I don't think we can

7

read that into the silence, and here's why.

We have

8

much more precise legislative history on this very

9

point.

At the time the provision was enacted, at the

10

time the UCMJ was enacted, there was Article 73 of the

11

UCMJ provides one means of collateral review within the

12

military justice system once a court-martial conviction

13

is final, and that's a new trial petition, which is

14

limited to certain subject matter and certain time

15

limits.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

is it, it's limited to fact and fraud.

18
19

MR. SHAH:

It is pretty limited.

What

To fraud on the court and newly

discovered evidence.

20

The person who drafted that provision -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it available to

22

someone who enters a guilty plea?

23

MR. SHAH:

It does not appear it would be

24

available to someone who has entered a guilty plea.

25

government is not aware of any cases where the military
13
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has granted an Article 73 petition to someone who has

2

pled guilty.

3

But the important point is at the time that

4

provision was enacted, the person who drafted that

5

provision testified before Congress and said, we've

6

considered the universe of post-conviction remedies, and

7

specifically named coram nobis relief, and said that

8

we've looked at it and we think the only circumstances

9

that warrant appeal within the military court system

10

beyond coram nobis are those stated within or including

11

coram nobis are those stated within Article 73

12

specifically.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you just -- and

14

I'm doing this from memory, so my premise of the

15

question may be wrong.

16

testimony in the brief, and I -- if I recall it

17

correctly, the person testifying said that the 73 was

18

sort of a combination of coram nobis and new -- and new

19

trial motion practice.

20

there was no statement, or at least it wasn't quoted in

21

the briefs, to the effect that this is all there is.

22

But I do recall the quotation of

But my recollection was that

Now, there was -- it was explaining what 73

23

did, but it was not an explanation to the effect that if

24

you didn't get under the tent flap in 73 you were out

25

completely.

Am I correct about that?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. SHAH:

Well, I'll read the testimony to

you, Justice Souter.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

MR. SHAH:

Okay.

And this appears on pages 25 to

5

26 of the government's brief, and it says:

6

was to combine what amounts to a writ of error coram

7

nobis with a motion for a new trial on newly discovered

8

evidence.

minds they are the only additional circumstances over

10

"What we did

We have provided for both of them and to our

and above the appeal that need a remedy."

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. SHAH:

Okay, I see.

So I think that's conclusive on

13

this point and provides a firm ground on which to

14

distinguish this Court's decision in Morgan, which you

15

referenced earlier, that applies coram nobis in the

16

Article III system.

Congress considered it for the

argument boils down to the proposition that the relevant

2

can explain why you contend that if the Respondent had

3

been convicted in a Federal district court and

4

everything else was the same, he would be able to

5

petition for a writ of coram nobis, but he can't in the

6

military courts.

creature of statute.

It

That's the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

first distinction.

2

The second distinction, Your Honor, even if

3

this Court wasn't convinced by that jurisdictional

4

argument, is that Congress specifically considered

5

whether to -- to allow coram nobis petitions within the

6

military court system.

7

to be a residual source of authority to fill gaps within

8

the system.

9

The All Writs Act was designed

It is not JUSTICE ALITO:

Well -- well, that, as I

quibble with the characterization to -- to -- that it

5

MR. SHAH:

The difference is significant,

Your Honor.

In the -- in the military court system

7

there is only one avenue for post-conviction relief.

8

That is, after your -- and I'm speaking after your

direct review -- appellate review process has been

10

complete, there's only one, and that is the Article 73

11

12

system there are several independent grants of

13

jurisdiction, the habeas jurisdiction -

14

Of course, in -- in the Article III

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought the Morgan

15

case said that coram nobis was not dependent on any

16

that a coram nobis application challenging a conviction

MR. SHAH:

Honor, the Court was refuting the argument that 2255,

The whole idea of coram

nobis is to protect the integrity of the jurisdiction

the court already has.

15

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, this Court could not

have been clearer in Goldsmith.

Act requires an independent basis, an existing

18

independent basis of jurisdiction.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It says the All Writs

I -- I acknowledge that.

20

But there is a source of jurisdiction here.

21

is to ensure the accurate exercise of jurisdiction that

22

the court has earlier asserted.

MR. SHAH:

Coram nobis

No, this is 7 years.

stool you want to rest on.

he's a civilian that has left the military.

Part of this you say, well,
And then I

10

read that.

It seems to have nothing to do with it.

11

your other argument seems to be that doesn't matter.

12

MR. SHAH:

JUSTICE BREYER:

But

Well No military soldier can

correct an error, no matter how egregious, even a

down, because Congress didn't want them to.

obvious -- if the error is that obvious and that

egregious.

25

And, of course, there's

Now, you did refer to a second argument,
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

which is an independent argument, which is that the

2

military courts lack jurisdiction for the independent

3

reason that Respondent -- it's an independent reason,

4

Your Honor, that he lacks any remaining connection to

5

the armed forces and, therefore, cannot invoke the

6

military courts.

7

that Congress lacks power under Article I to extend

8

military court jurisdiction over a civilian.

9

This Court held in Toth v. Quarrels

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I know, but that's -

10

that's a different -- that's a different issue from -

11

from whether it -- it may retain some residual

12

jurisdiction to correct an error with respect to someone

13

over whom it has had jurisdiction.

14

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, once again, that

15

would be relying on the long-expired past jurisdiction.

16

It is -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you -- you made that

point before.

And I -- I want to follow up with one

19

question on that.

the -- to the Morgan argument.

21

analysis was, well, this isn't a -- a new ground or a

22

new assertion.

23

24

metaphysical continuation of the -- the jurisdiction

25

that existed before.

As I recall, it was in response to
The -- the Morgan

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

And your response to that was, in effect, a

2

Goldsmith response.

3

jurisdiction doesn't mean present jurisdiction.

4

past jurisdiction is over, and that's under -- under the

5

statute and under Goldsmith that's -- that's the end of

6

it.

7

And -- and you said past
The

Couldn't that same argument simply have been

8

made, however, in -- in Morgan?

In other words, Morgan

9

was a case in which the point of finality had been

10

reached.

11

there's coram nobis jurisdiction, and yet the Court's

12

analysis -- I -- I called it metaphysical a second ago

13

-- was that this really was simply a continuation of the

14

past jurisdiction.

15

Morgan, why isn't it a sound argument with respect to

16

the -- the military code here?

17

There was no specific statute in Morgan saying

If that was a sound argument in

MR. SHAH:

Well, because the military --

18

Congress specifically contemplated that possibility, and

now I'm going back to my Article 73 argument, Your

Honor, and to the legislative history which shows what

Congress was trying to do in Article 73.

there's -- there is no question that it certainly made

system, so far as express provision is concerned, there

5

are limits.

6

seems to me that the same argument could be made there

7

that was made here -

There are statutes of limitations, and it

8

MR. SHAH:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

But in the civilian

MR. SHAH:

Well, I think this -- that was made there.

Your Honor, I think the structure

11

of the military court system is different than the

12

civilian system, and -- and that goes back to -

13
14
15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Outside of 1531, is there

any structural difference?
MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor.

In the military

16

court system, Article 76, even though it was first

17

enacted in 19 -- in 1950, there were other provisions

18

analogous to it.

19

military system that once a conviction was final and the

20

military authority executed the judgment, that was it in

21

terms of review within the military justice system, save

22

for a presidential pardon.

23

obtained was through an Article III habeas petition in

24

the Federal courts.

25

Congress had when it enacted the UCMJ, and that's the

It's always been understood within the

Any further relief to be

That's the understanding that

2

understanding JUSTICE SOUTER:

You could say the same

3

thing, that when the statute of limitations is passed in

4

a habeas case or, indeed, after habeas has been fallen,

5

so far as the statutes governing Article III courts are

6

concerned, that's the end.

7

isn't the end.

8
9

And yet Morgan says, no, it

There's this coram nobis jurisdiction.

MR. SHAH:

Well, the difference is in

Morgan, the Court specifically said that Congress did

10

not intend to occupy the field when it passed 2255

11

governing habeas relief for Federal prisoners.

12

not the situation here.

13

to occupy the field when it passed Article 73.

14

That's

We know that Congress intended

So regardless of the jurisdictional

15

arguments, Your Honor, there's no right of action,

16

there's no right of coram nobis relief within the

No, Your Honor.

2

MR. FREEDUS:

I think Congress has the

authority to legislate very broadly in the area of

collateral remedies, and Congress could take away the

and effective substitute, like it did in 2255.

adequate and effective substitute -

MR. FREEDUS:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

Our view is that if -- which would cover every

situation no matter how fanciful, right?

13

MR. FREEDUS:

No, Your Honor.

We believe

14

there has to be reasonable opportunity to bring a

15

colorable constitutional claim for which there is no

16

other avenue of relief, which we believe is the case

17

here.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- which case

19

of ours establishes the proposition that there always

20

has to be an available avenue of relief?

21

MR. FREEDUS:

The best authority we have for

22

that, Your Honor, is Webster v. Doe, which we believe

23

stands for the proposition that courts should read

24

statutes so as not to preclude judicial review of a

25

constitutional claim absent an express congressional
28

intent to do so -

expressions of finality that -- that are -- that are in

On -- well, if I could make

you can patch it up and say that they thought it wasn't

a good idea to have just military courts.

constitutionally compelled?

Will you clarify something

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, Your Honor.
I'm sorry -

You might say that there

is a lurking constitutional question and that we ought

15

to interpret the statute to avoid a constitutional

16

concern.

17
18

MR. FREEDUS:

I think, Your Honor, that's

the best answer that I should have given.

19

(Laughter.)

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

I don't like it very

much.

But what is -- your argument is that the

Constitution does not require that this person have,

right now, an available avenue of relief, your position?

25

MR. FREEDUS:

We don't have square authority
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

from this Court to support that proposition.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So then it comes, as

3

Justice Kennedy suggested, a question of whether or not

4

we should read the statutes here in a particular way to

5

avoid confronting that question?

6

MR. FREEDUS:

Yes, Your Honor, I think

7

where -- we're comfortably in that neck of the woods and

8

we really don't need to get closer to the scarier

9

question that was alluded to.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think When you say it's lurking,

11

you're -- you're invoking the doctrine of constitutional

12

avoidance?

13

MR. FREEDUS:

Yes, Your Honor, we are.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.
I don't think it's much of

a lurk when for 200 years this was going on.

lurking to my mind.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not

But you are making -- I

19

thought that the core of your argument is that the All

20

Writs Act applies to all courts established by Congress,

21

the military courts are included in that definition, and

22

there is nothing in the All Writs Act that says it

23

doesn't apply to the military.

24

requires that the writ be in aid of the court's

25

jurisdiction.

But the All Writs Act

So if you would spell out how the writ

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

here is in aid of the military court's jurisdiction.

2

MR. FREEDUS:

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe

3

it does it in a very similar way that this Court

4

explained in the United States v. Morgan, and that is

the writ of coram nobis aids the past appellate

6

jurisdiction that the Navy court had when it affirmed

7

It had

the Court would not have issued the judgment that it

MR. FREEDUS:

So that's what you foresee?

I would -- yes and no.
What way is it no?

No is when the individual is

7

not in custody and the six-year statute of limitations

8

has expired for all the types of claims that are

9

available for collateral tactic of a court-martial

10

conviction, a declaratory judgment attack, a mandamus

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- in other words, in

wouldn't have any remedy, you would agree with the

15

government about that, if it's seven years later you

16

find a clerical error?

Well, if, in fact, you're

21

waiting until the -- the civil courts have lost all

And moreover, why doesn't your client

You're claiming that if all the statutes

4

have run and everything, there is no coram nobis

5

jurisdiction, I thought in your case they had all run.

6

MR. FREEDUS:

This gets to the other piece

7

of the answer I was trying to give, and that is a

8

petitioner from the military system could not file a

9

coram nobis petition in the Article III courts or the

10

Court of Federal Claims because there's no authority

11

that supports the proposition that you can take a coram

12

nobis petition and attack a judgment from a different

13

jurisdiction.

14

issued -- that -- that -

15

Coram nobis has to allow the court that

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then you're saying that

16

what you're foreseeing is through coram nobis,

17

indefinitely, a person outside the military who once was

18

in it can bring constitutional challenges?

19

MR. FREEDUS:

20

military justice system.

21

Yes, Your Honor, in the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, okay, and we see those

22

every day, don't we?

But there is one difference.

23

difference is that often, though not always, a person in

24

habeas who challenges a prior normal, civil system

25

conviction, the State can retry him; and I guess in the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

instance that we're talking about, he can never be

2

retried.

3

view, the civilians who bring this would never be

4

retried if they're right.

So in fact the difference would be, in your

5

MR. FREEDUS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so they would have in

7

that sense greater protection in the military system

8

than in the ordinary criminal courts a person has in

9

habeas, because the option of retrial is often but not

10

always there.

11

that?

12

Now, why would Congress have intended

MR. FREEDUS:

I think it's the very nature

13

of the coram nobis petition, Your Honor, and that is

14

coram nobis petitioners have already served their entire

15

sentence, so the societal interest to seek a retrial is

16

much lesser than in the habeas case where there's a

17

lengthy sentence less -- left, and if someone gets out

18

of jail -

MR. FREEDUS:

think that's what we're saying.

47

1

with somebody who is outside -- long departed from the

2

military system?

3

MR. FREEDUS:

Well, I would -- I would

4

direct the Court's attention, if I could, to footnote 11

5

of Goldsmith, where this Court says:

6

once a criminal conviction has been finally reviewed

7

within the military system, and a servicemember in

8

custody has exhausted other avenues provided under the

9

UCMJ to seek relief from his conviction" -- citing Noyd,

"And of course,

10

the six pages therein which refers to the military

11

court's habeas power -- this Court in Goldsmith put

12

habeas power in the context of a -- a final case, so

13

habeas authority after final relief.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's talking about somebody

15

still within the military, if I -- if I heard the quote

correctly, right?

MR. FREEDUS:

An individual is out of the

-- or their discharge has been executed and they're in

20

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. FREEDUS:

military.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The quote you referred to

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

from Goldsmith says:

"And a servicemember in custody."

2

So I think Goldsmith, in that footnote that you're

3

citing, is presenting a service member still in custody,

4

having exhausted all other areas, can come to a Federal

5

district court and seek habeas.

6

someone who is out of the military.

7

MR. FREEDUS:

It's not talking about

I read it differently, Your

8

Honor.

I read it -- the next clause in that sentence is

9

referring to habeas outside.

I read this sentence as

10

clearly saying that there's direct review.

11

habeas after direct review within the military.

12

then there's of course collateral review in the Article

13

III courts, if -- if everything misfires within the

14

military justice system.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's
And

Well, what am I missing?

16

I thought that the footnote reads once a criminal

17

conviction has been finally reviewed within the military

18

system a service member, having exhausted all other

19

areas, can petition in a Federal district court for a

20

writ of habeas corpus.

21

about someone who is no longer a service member.

22

MR. FREEDUS:

I don't see anything that talks

Right.

I -- I see the

23

in-custody and exhausted avenues provided in the UCMJ as

24

referring to a phase before you get to the Article III

25

courts.

Obviously, if I'm reading it wrong, the Court
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

will let me know, but I read that as prior to Article

2

3

If I could talk briefly about the 1983

4

legislation -- it came up in opposing counsel's opening.

I think it sheds a lot of light on the availability of

collateral review power and saying, when we do that,

24

don't worry, Congress, because it will channel these

25

collateral -- post-final collateral attacks into the

5

MR. FREEDUS:

-- coram nobis.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under the specific

7

provision that was at issue, which is accompanied by

8

very strict finality provisions.

9

There's no suggestion in his testimony that

10

the availability of the relief that he's talking about

11

continues after the individual is outside the military

12

system.

13

through a specific provision applicable only within the

14

military system.

15

He's channeling -- he says these are channeled

MR. FREEDUS:

I don't read it that way, Your

16

Honor.

I read it as channeling apt post-final attacks

17

within the military -- within the courts in the military

18

justice system, even though the person is -- is -- a

19

final judgment typically happens before an individual is

20

no longer in the service.

21

because the discharge has been executed.

22

referring to is, once you have a final judgment, you

23

then can seek collateral relief in the military the way

24

you used to be able to do it in the correction boards in

25

the military courts.

A final judgment is final
So what he's

And he was saying, now that we're
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

getting rid of this one collateral remedy in the

2

correction boards, we're giving you this other one.

3

We're not giving -- we're just channeling all of them

4

into the military appellate courts, which is a more

5

appropriate judicial forum.

6

would denigrate the courts to have administrative bodies

7

overturning their judgments, once again showing that

8

these are final judgments that we're talking about.

9

the only -- that was the only premise he offered to make

10
11

And he says clearly it

And

the change.
So stripping away one remedy while leaving

12

another intact was the single premise, which is

13

reflected in the House -- the Senate report on page 52

14

of our brief, where Congress adopts the exact language

15

out of his sworn testimony with, you know, a tiny

16

variation, but that's the premise for the change in the

17

legislation.

18

I'd also note that, in that legislation,

19

this is the Department of Defense proposing to open the

20

door to this Court's jurisdiction for the first time in

21

-- in 28 U.S.C. 1259.

22

survey the whole landscape of military justice

23

24

direct review cases, which are reflected in 1259

25

paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, and this other category that is

And when it did that -- it had to

4

The government

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

I've had

5

the chance to go back and look at the Senate report, and

6

like Mr. Taft's testimony, there's no suggestion in

7

there that the relief he's talking about continues after

8

someone is out of the service.

9

MR. FREEDUS:

I think that's implicit in

10

final judgment, Your Honor.

11

judgment.

12

If there's a final

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, a final

13

judgment is subject to review in the appellate courts

14

within -- in the military system, just like you have -

15

a final court of appeals judgment is subject to review

16

in our system.

17

MR. FREEDUS:

Your Honor, the -- the key

18

difference is that -- two things:

19

post-finality, which means that the discharge or the -

20

you know, the sentence has been executed.

21

out.

22

nobis, by its very nature, is someone who is not in

23

custody.

24

to read that what he is saying here is -

25

He's referring to

They're a civilian at that point.

The person is
And coram

So I don't think it's too much of an inference

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you have

judgment is they're to be discharged, and they seek

3

review.

on?

5

Someone is -- the

Are they discharged while the review is going

MR. FREEDUS:

No, on direct review, you're

6

right, Your Honor.

They're -- they remain within the

7

service, and it's interesting that the government cites

8

Mr. Taft's testimony as authoritative on that point.

9

And that -- that makes good sense.

Keep the person in

10

for a direct review so that if the sentence is set

11

aside, we can retry.

12

But there has been decades of

13

military justice authority that says even if someone is

14

discharged before their conviction is set aside -- so

15

they're on direct review, their conviction is set aside,

16

after they're already out in their civilian world, you

17

know, doing whatever they're doing -- if the government

18

wants to retry them, they do.

19

is the party that asserts continuing jurisdiction to

20

re-prosecute.

21

And the government is -

And that's why this case is so

22

distinguishable from Toth v. Quarles, because in Toth

there was no conviction while the individual was on

it can try that.

uptick, and there may actually have been an uptick while

-- it has gotten a lot of visibility in the military,

just like there was an uptick after Noyd v. Bond when

19

this Court declared for the first time that military

20

courts had All Writs Act power.

21

So I think there could be an uptick.

But

22

once the novelty of it wears off, I think we will see

23

level off.

24

seen since 66 when it was available the first time.

25

mean this isn't new.

And you will see the same trend that we have

The only thing new here is the

government's interpretation of Article 66.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

3

MR. FREEDUS:

4

Mr. Shah, you have three minutes remaining.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Shah, could you tell us

6

what the government's position is on whether, when

7

somebody has been discharged from the service and then a

8

conviction which he -- which he suffered while he was in

9

the service is set aside, can he be retried in military

10
11

courts?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

12
13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHAH:

Not if he has passed his

14

enlistment period, no, Your Honor.

15

view is they would not be able to retry him.

16

The government's

I would just like to make four quick points

17

in response.

18

could someone be in custody after finality?

19

yes, that -- that could be the case.

20

doesn't have to issue a bad conduct discharge as part of

21

its sentence.

22

the military during the post finality period.

23

First, to the Chief Justice's question,
Of course,

The military

He could still be in confinement within

The second point I would like to make is

24

that Noyd v. Bond is clearly distinguishable.

25

dealt with habeas review within the military while the
56
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

person was still pursuing his direct appeal.

2

was a clear, independent basis of jurisdiction in the

3

Noyd v. Bond type situation, and that's the Article 66

4

and 67 direct review jurisdiction, and that -

5
6
7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So there

What has direct review got

to do with habeas?
MR. SHAH:

Well -- well, Your Honor, the -

8

the habeas would be in aid of the direct review

9

jurisdiction.

10
11
12

In -- in Noyd -- in the Noyd v. Bond -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In the civil system we

regard it as -- as entirely a separate proceeding.
MR. SHAH:

Well, what was going on in Noyd

13

v. Bond, Your Honor, is he was pursuing a habeas

14

petition for release pending the -- the resolution of

15

his direct appeal.

16

the petition to the same court reviewing his direct

17

appeal on the merits, and it became part and parcel of

18

that jurisdiction.

19

So the military courts just referred

The third point I would like to -- to make

20

is in response to Justice Kennedy's question, which

21

shows the incompatibility of coram nobis relief within

22

the military justice system.

23

this DuBay procedure where -- where a new court-martial

24

-- and DuBay sets this out.

25

have to be convened, and then they would have a

That they've had to create

The new court-martial does

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

factfinding tribunal in which new -- a new military

2

judge would have to be assigned to govern it.

3

None of that is specified within Congress's

4

scheme.

That has all been created.

It shows the

5

incompatibility of the practical burdens that this

6

procedure places on the military, and nothing in Article

7

66(c) which governs the jurisdiction of the military

8

appellate courts, the intermediate courts, references

9

any independent factfinding power.

It says in a case

10

referred to it, the court of criminal appeals may act

11

only with respect to the findings and sentence as

12

approved by the convening authority.

13

such findings of guilty and the sentence or such part or

14

amount of the sentence as it finds correct in law and

15

fact and determines on the basis of the entire record.

16
17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It may affirm only

Why don't you

briefly make your fourth point.
MR. SHAH:

The fourth -- fourth point is in

19

response to Justice Breyer.

20

inform me that in the situation of a true clerical

21

error, they could go to the Board of Correction of

22

Military Review and seek correction of that error.

23
24
25

My military colleagues

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.
