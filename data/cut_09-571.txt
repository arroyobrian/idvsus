CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 09-571, Connick v. Thompson.

5

Mr. Duncan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART K. DUNCAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. DUNCAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case asks when a district attorney's

11

office may be liable under section 1983 for inadequately

12

training prosecutors.

13

District Attorney's Office, was found liable for the

14

terrible injuries caused to Mr. Thompson by a Brady

15

violation on the theory the office was deliberately

16

indifferent to Brady training, this despite the fact

17

that there was proved no pattern of previous misconduct

18

by office prosecutors.

19

The Petitioner, Orleans Parish

The district court exempted this case from

20

the ordinary pattern requirement by making a flawed

21

analogy to a hypothetical in this Court's City of Canton

22

opinion.

23

liable, absent a pattern, if it fails to inform police

24

officers of the basic constitutional standard for deadly

25

force.

There, the Court suggested that a city may be

Extending that hypothetical to this case was

2

error.

It misunderstood Canton's distinction between

3

single-incident and pattern liability, nullifying

4

Canton's stringent standards of fault and causation.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't this something in

6

between?

Because in Canton, the hypothetical was one

7

rookie police officer.

8

prosecutor.

9

this blood evidence, and there were multiple

Here, it wasn't one rogue

There were four prosecutors who knew of

10

opportunities for them to disclose it, but four of them

11

apparently thought it was okay under Brady to keep this

12

quiet.

13

Now, if we were just talking about -- what

14

was his name, Deegan? -- it would be a different case.

15

But we have the three other prosecutors.

16

it's questionable to characterize this as a single

17

incident.

18

MR. DUNCAN:

And so I think

I understand your question,

19

Justice Ginsburg.

Our argument does not turn on whether

20

it was one or three or four prosecutors.

21

argument does turn on is that the theory from the Canton

22

hypothetical, which does not require a pattern, was

23

clearly at issue in this case.

24

analogized to Canton in order to allow the jury to find

25

liability absent a pattern.

What our

The district court

4

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

There is no question that, whether it was

2

one or four prosecutors, this is a single incident of a

3

Brady violation.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, this is a

5

single incident, and Canton said if you know that a tort

6

is likely to happen without training, then one incident

7

is enough.

8

Every prosecutor knows that there can be

9

Brady violations if people are not taught what Brady

10

means, because it's not self-evident in every situation,

11

correct?

12
13

MR. DUNCAN:
Sotomayor.

14

That's -- that's true, Justice

Yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So if you

15

know that rookie prosecutors -- and most prosecutors'

16

offices are filled with young ADAs who have just come

17

out of law school.

18

meet some situations where the answer is not intuitively

19

known, like that if you get a lab report, you should

20

turn it over, don't you have an obligation, isn't that

21

what the jury said, to train them to turn over lab

22

reports?

If you know that they are going to

23

Now, I know you claim you had that policy.

24

MR. DUNCAN:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
We can talk later about

5

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

whether or not there was sufficient evidence for the

2

jury to disbelieve that you had that policy or not.

3

That's a sufficiency of the evidence question.

4

But if you know that lab reports have to be

5

turned over, you've conceded it's a Brady violation not

6

to do it, and there was sufficient -- and you had no

7

policy -- I know you are disputing that -- and you had

8

no policy of turning it over, why aren't you responsible

9

for a Canton-like violation?

10

MR. DUNCAN:

The question is under the Brady

11

scenario, which side of the Canton line does it fall on?

12

Does it fall on the single-incident line or the pattern

13

line?

14

We say it falls on the pattern line.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Life doesn't always come

15

in just two categories, and my suggestion to you is this

16

doesn't fit into a single rookie.

17

You have -- if you have four prosecutors who

18

are not turning over this evidence, then it seems like

19

there's kind of a culture in the office that we don't

20

turn over -- either we don't understand Brady, because

21

one suggestion was -- well, having the blood sample will

22

show you -- you'd have to have the blood sample from

23

Thompson to have it mean anything.

24
25

So there was misunderstanding about that.
But what struck me was that the -- to shoehorn this into
6

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

a single incident, it doesn't fit.

2

situation maybe that hasn't -- that we haven't directly

3

confronted before.

4

MR. DUNCAN:

So we have a

I think the Court has in

5

Canton, Your Honor.

pay close attention to the function of the

7

single-incident hypothetical in Canton, I think it

8

illuminates the kind of notice, the kind of fault, and

9

the kind of causation that needs to arise out of a

Let me answer it this way:

If we

general situation.

11

So looking carefully, what Canton said is:

12

A policymaker who fails to give police officers the

13

basic constitutional standard for deadly force, which

14

they are not equipped to know in the beginning, and

15

without which they -

16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you tell me -- I

think I have a copy.

18

MR. DUNCAN:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Yes.

19

This is -- this is -- I'm referring to the -- the basic

20

Canton standard is at 390, page 390 of the Canton

21

opinion.

22

that discusses the two possibilities, the no-pattern and

23

the pattern possibilities.

24
25

And specifically, the footnote is footnote 10,

So -- and I'm reading from Canton at
footnote 10.

City policymakers know -- "For example,"

5

task.

6

The city has armed its officers

Thus, the need to train officers in the

Now, what we have there, as Justice

10

O'Connor's concurrence in that case and then later the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

That's correct.
And do not know that you

cannot apply deadly force in most circumstances?
MR. DUNCAN:

They've got no background

23

equipment to know what the constitutional standard is.

24

And so that satisfies, in a general situation -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

is the task of analyzing legal judgments.

11

judgments go astray, Justice Sotomayor?

12

Absolutely.

13

Absolutely.

But JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now what you're

14

suggesting is that for certainty you know that a

15

lawyer's judgment is going to go astray because a

16

particular area of law is that complicated.

17

Your people disagreed -- some of your people

18

disagreed or didn't know whether turning over a lab

19

report was a -- failure to turn over a lab report when

20

you didn't know a defendant's blood type was a Brady

21

violation.

22

accept as a working proposition that they should have

23

known that.

24
25

That has been conceded in this case, so I

What you're suggesting is you get a pass
because, even though you know that there's an area of
9

law that a young lawyer is not going to be able to

2

figure out on their own, you fail to train them and

there was a Brady violation here -

MR. DUNCAN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
-- but in answer to some of

5

the questions, it seems to me you were possibly -- or at

6

least you did not express an opinion on the suggestion

7

that it is always a violation of Brady to fail to turn

8

over a lab report.

MR. DUNCAN:

I'm not aware that it would

12

evidence, that the office policy was to turn over all

Sure.
-- just to test how strong

your position is here.

So let's say that there is a new DA comes to

town, and he says, there's going to be one attorney per

21

case from now on, and it will be a random assignment

22

system.

So sometimes important cases will be tried by

And there will be no

11

Alderson Reporting Company


And there

Official - Subject to Final Review

is a closed file system, that we only turn over what

2

we're required to turn over and not anything else.

3

And in addition to that, if I, the DA, find

4

that you have turned over things that you're not

required to turn over, that will be taken into account

And so he puts into place this whole system

18

and -- and says, okay, go to it.

And what happens is

19

that there are Brady violations.

And there's a Brady

violation in a capital case and the person sits on death

21

row, or the person is executed, whichever, and there's a

claim brought.

23

Is that claim not a good claim?

25

If there is a pattern of

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There's not a pattern,

because he just came to town and he just, you know,

Brady violation.

5

MR. DUNCAN:

Not for the first Brady

6

violation, Justice Kagan.

7

noted a policy of actually assigning inexperienced

8

prosecutors randomly to perhaps high-profile cases.

9

But in your hypothetical, you

If that were the facts, the jury, as they

10

could have in this case, could have found that an

11

official policy actually caused the violation.

12

didn't find it in this case.

13

that possibility.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But they

So the hypo leaves open

But the failure to train or

15

supervise in any way and the setting up a structural

16

system that's pretty much guaranteed to produce Brady

17

violations, that would not be enough?

18

In other words, even if the jury said yes,

19

you are liable under that second theory -- not the

20

policy theory, but the failure to train and supervise

21

theory -- that -- that would have to be rejected?

22

MR. DUNCAN:

No -- exactly, Your Honor.

No

23

liability there, because it doesn't meet the stringent

24

fault and causation standards of Canton.

was about was an instance where there was only -- it was

And when I read the

But then when I read your second reiteration

11

of the question, which is a little different, and read

12

13

And so what you're really asking us to do is to decide

14

in the case of perfect instructions whether the evidence

15

supports them.

and, frankly, as raised, the brief I think clearly

supports it, but others could disagree.

23

Let me start here, Justice Breyer.

These

The second instruction there allows a

24

choice.

It allows a choice for the jury to find that a

25

single-incident situation -- I'm sorry -- that a
15

Alderson Reporting Company

situation involving a Brady decision could arise and be

2

a basis -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

What are the words -- I

4

mean, it looked to me like the words on page 828 are

5

pretty similar to my copy of what he actually said.

6

what are the words on page 828 that you think he should

7

have said that he didn't say?

8
9
10

MR. DUNCAN:

So

"The situation involved a

difficult choice or one that prosecutors had a history
of mishandling."

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

What he says

12

here is, "The situation involved a difficult choice or

13

one that the prosecutors had a history of mishandling,

14

such that additional training, supervision, or

15

monitoring was clearly needed."

16

So it looks to me like, unless I'm reading

17

the wrong page, which I've sometimes done out of my memo

18

here.

It looks to me like he gave those words.

MR. DUNCAN:

What our main complaint is, is

13

about the failure of the district court to grant a

I understood -- and

maybe I'm confused -- that you were arguing that there

was no set of circumstances in which a prosecutor could

train for one incident.

what the facts are.

4

you would never constitute an actionable claim against a

prosecutor; is that your position in this case?

6

The facts that Justice Kagan gave

MR. DUNCAN:

That's -- under the Canton

hypothetical, yes.

It would have to fall on the pattern

side because the general Brady situation is unlike the

Could I add to my

hypothetical, then?

MR. DUNCAN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Suppose that this new

district attorney said -- you know, every day he came

crazy, and I think it's just the worst decision that the

Supreme Court has ever issued; and as long as you don't

get caught, anything you do is okay by me.

23

Well, this Court has defined

"policy" as a deliberate choice to embark on a course of

action in Pembaur, which this Court accepted.

sounds like a policy to me.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That

If it's not a policy Then the policy is just that

6

you -- you have to turn over what you have to turn over,

7

nothing else, and if you turn over anything else you'll

8

get penalized for doing so.

9

MR. DUNCAN:

That's the policy.

Well, then the policy is

10

constitutional.

11

prosecutors failing to exercise their judgment properly

12

pursuant to that policy?

13

within the second part of the Canton choices, which

14

requires a pattern.

15

So what we would look to is, are

And that falls very squarely

remedy, to guide, to reinforce, the pre-existing legal

17

judgment that a prosecutor has by virtue of being a

law schools where they don't even have such a course and

23

others where most -- I don't know anywhere it's

24

compulsory to take a course in criminal procedure.

25

you're assuming that.

And, of course, the time is

running.

2

Brady, which seems to me unlike others and why you would

3

want special vigilance.

4

you know what was said; search and seizure, you know

5

what the police did.

6

this case illustrates it so well -- is you don't know.

7

If the prosecutors don't do what they're supposed to do,

8

there's a very high risk, as there was in this case,

9

that it will never come to light.

10

There's something I wanted to ask you about

And that is, Miranda warnings,

But the problem with Brady -- and

So, recognizing the legal obligation of the

11

prosecutor and the temptation not to come out with Brady

12

evidence because it doesn't help the State's case,

13

shouldn't there be extra vigilance when we're talking

14

about a Brady claim?

15

MR. DUNCAN:

Well, of course, there should

16

be vigilance, but the question you pose,

17

Justice Ginsburg, is whether the latency, the

18

hiddenness, that characterizes Brady violations should

19

change where we locate the Canton violation.

20

be enough to put it into the single-incident, so-obvious

21

category, or still in the pattern category?

22

doesn't indicate that the latency of a particular

23

violation should -- should turn on which category it

24

goes into.

25

duties and the employees themselves and how

Should it

But Canton

Instead, it's the nature of the employee

21

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

that situation gives notice to a policymaker about when

2

there are obvious training risks.

3

talking about.

4

That's what we're

So to go back to the hypothetical in Canton,

5

whether or not a deadly force situation is secret or

6

not -- of course, it's not.

7

not just to train, but to inform of the basic

8

constitutional duty without which those officers have no

9

chance of fulfilling their duties.

But the office has failed

And when they do a

10

deadly force violation under those circumstances, the

11

causal link will be very strong.

12

enough to meet Canton.

It will be strong

13

And so there you have -- there you have a

14

situation where deliberate indifference and causation

15

are met without the pattern.

16

have that in the situation of Brady compliance because,

17

as -- as everyone agrees Brady involves gray areas.

18

is -- it is impossible to determine beforehand exactly

19

why a Brady violation will occur and what specific

20

training measures would prevent it from occurring.

21

But what -- you do not

It

And what that means is this falls plainly

22

within what Canton said about the pattern situation.

23

And here's what Canton said in the footnote 10 following

24

onto the hypothetical.

25

police, in exercising their discretion, so often violate

"It could also be that the

22

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

constitutional rights that the need for further training

2

must have been plainly obvious...."

3

That's the situation we have posed by the

4

Brady situation in general.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

-- he read the instructions.

7

Canton.

But, look -- I

They came right out of

Seems perfect.

8
9

All right.

Now you're saying, well, whether they did or
not, you cannot have an incident -- you can't have

10

liability if there's only one incident.

11

point, I say, gee, I don't know.

I mean, maybe it

12

depends on what the incident is.

Maybe the incident

13

involved somebody saying, hey, Brady?

14

somebody saying, what's a criminal trial?

15

person needs training.

16

And at that

What's Brady?

I mean, that

And -- or -- but I don't even have to think

17

of that here, because there were four incidents here.

18

And, therefore, I don't have to try to make up weird

19

hypotheticals.

20

have correct instructions, what's the problem?

21

So where we have four instances and we

MR. DUNCAN:

Your Honor, there weren't four

22

instances.

23

could have involved one to four prosecutors.

25

There was one Brady violation that possibly

Okay.

Okay.

That's

We have -- we

I thought that they had several

MR. DUNCAN:

No.

No, Your Honor.
All involved -- in other

5

words, there has never in this office been an instance

of a Brady violation outside of this case.

true.

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not -- not before this

There was some -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

After, that's what it was.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- later, as far as we

13
14

know.
MR. DUNCAN:

There were some -- there were

15

four reported Brady violations before this case, in the

16

decade leading up, involving this office, that had

17

nothing to do with the circumstances involved here.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

violations involving this office, okay?

20
21
22
23

MR. DUNCAN:

Ah.

There were four Brady

Correct, out of tens of

thousands of prosecutions.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So now we're

talking about not one; we are talking about four -

24

MR. DUNCAN:

We're -- but we're not -

25

JUSTICE BREYER: -- over many years, with
24

Alderson Reporting Company

tens of thousands of violations, correct?

2

MR. DUNCAN:

What was -- the Fifth Circuit

3

panel in this case affirmatively said Thompson did not

4

even try to prove a pattern, and he did not prove a

5

pattern of violations.

6

that.

The Fifth Circuit panel said

This is helpful.

you.

would the instruction in your view have been proper, if

13

the "or" had been replaced by an "and."

situation involved a difficult choice and one that

15

prosecutors had a history of mishandling."

16

MR. DUNCAN:

"The

That's closer to what it should

be, Justice Kennedy, yes, because that begins to capture

the pattern requirement.

20

the Petitioners in instruction number 15.

21

It's not -- it's not the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Has there been -- has

there been any argument that you have waived your

objection to the instructions?

24

MR. DUNCAN:

Not by Petitioners -- not by

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
to it?

Did you -- did you object

To this charge?

4

MR. DUNCAN:

The -- the charge?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

With the "or" -

6

difficult choice "or" one that prosecutors had a history

7

of mishandling.

8
9

MR. DUNCAN:

No, the Petitioners did not

object to the -- the specific formulation of that

10

charge.

11

they said, no, but we -- we have to have a pattern

12

instruction here.

13
14
15

Immediately after that charge, though, they -

In other words -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In other words, the

pattern instruction was -- it was -- was rejected?
MR. DUNCAN:

It was rejected.

It was

16

rejected twice, Your Honor, first in the formal jury

17

instructions and then at the charge colloquy.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that wasn't the

19

question presented to us.

You didn't present to us an

20

issue of whether the jury instruction -

21

MR. DUNCAN:

No, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. DUNCAN:

-- was wrong or not.

What we present is the legal

24

theory on which this case was submitted -- what got to

25

the jury in the first place never should have got to
26

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

that legal theory at all.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You see, what I'm trying

3

to figure out is whether your position is that under no

4

circumstance, even the hypothetical that Justice Kagan

5

set forth, could you be charged with a single-incident

6

Canton violation.

7
8

That is your -- your theory?

MR. DUNCAN:

With respect to the Brady

situation, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

MR. DUNCAN:

The Brady situation.

Let me answer it this way:

11

What -- what the Canton single-incident hypo is talking

12

about is failing to provide employees with basic tools,

13

without which they absolutely have no chance of

14

fulfilling their constitutional obligations.

15

it's difficult to imagine that situation for

16

prosecutors.

If we -

17

It is -- it's conceivable that a district

18

attorney's office set up -- sets up a structure where

19

prosecutors have no chance of even knowing whether

20

there's Brady evidence in the file.

21

situation, then it's closer to the Canton

22

single-incident hypothetical, but not involving the

23

exercise of legal judgment in particular cases.

24

no.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you have that

Well, how do you

27

Alderson Reporting Company


We say

Official - Subject to Final Review
1

exercise legal judgment if you don't even know what

2

you're supposed to turn over?

3

Ginsburg's question.

4

MR. DUNCAN:

That's exactly -- that's my

5

point.

6

even -- in other words, if you don't even have a police

7

file, for instance, you can't exercise your legal

8

judgment if you don't even know what -- what the

9

subject of your legal -- the object of your legal

10
11

That's my point.

That was Justice

If you don't -- if you don't

judgment is.
But that's not this case.

What we're

12

talking about here is a failure to remedy, reinforce,

13

refine existing legal judgment that prosecutors have.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. GORDON COONEY, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20

22

MR. COONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Although the Petitioners' brief attempts to

23

relitigate factual issues that were resolved against

24

them by the jury, they have raised today only one

25

question of law, and that is whether this Court should
28

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

write into section 1983 a per se rule that the only way,

2

the only way, a civil rights victim can ever establish

3

the deliberate indifference of a district attorney is if

4

he can prove a prior significant history of assistant

5

prosecutors violating other citizens' constitutional

6

rights.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

violations.

9

violations.

10
11

They limit the principle to Brady

MR. COONEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I would

submit that -

12
13

For -- for Brady

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's a significant

limitation, don't you think?

14

MR. COONEY:

But I would submit, Your Honor,

15

that this Court's -- that their requirement for proving

16

deliberate indifference is, first, contrary to the

17

teaching of this Court in Canton and subsequent cases.

18

It finds no place in the language of section 1983 -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But at the -- but at the

20

outset it seemed to me -- and correct me if I'm wrong -

21

that you misstate the theory on which you seek to -- to

22

have a reversal, and that this is a failure-to-train

23

case.

You didn't mention that.

24

MR. COONEY:

Your Honor -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is a failure-to-train

29

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

case; is it not?

2

MR. COONEY:

It is absolutely a deliberate

3

indifference to the need to train and provide other

4

protections to the office.

5
6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I think that's very

important.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, if you could -- could

8

you just say as succinctly as possible what you would

9

tell assistant district attorneys if you were the

10

district attorney for this jurisdiction, and you, with

11

the benefit of hindsight, having seen this case, what

12

kind of -- what would you tell them they should do with

13

respect to Brady?

14

MR. COONEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

First of all

15

I think Canton says you have to look at the specific

16

circumstances.

17

one-size-fits-all way or message that has to be

18

provided.

19

And so I don't think there's a

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

them, so:

21

under Brady.

Now I want to tell you what you have to do

22

MR. COONEY:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

MR. COONEY:

25

No, but you are training

Well, first What do you tell them?

In this office, Your Honor, I

think the first thing one has to confront is Mr.
30

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

Connick's testimony and, in fact, the concession that

2

the Petitioners made on pages 6 and 7 of their merits

3

brief that the office started with what the brief

4

described as "Connick's disclosure policies were no

5

mystery" -- turn over what the law required and nothing

6

more.

I mean, that would be -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well,

8

Justice Alito's question was, what you would tell the

9

assistant DAs?

10

What's your answer?

MR. COONEY:

And Mr. Chief Justice, with -

11

if -- first of all, I wouldn't start with that rule.

12

But if I started with that rule it would be incumbent

13

upon me -

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:
that rule?

16

The rule is perfectly lawful, my goodness.
MR. COONEY:

17

an unlawful rule.

18

message.

19

Why wouldn't you start with

Your Honor, I'm not saying it's

However, it requires a countervailing

And if you're going to adopt JUSTICE ALITO:

I really would appreciate it

20

if you'd get to my question.

21

exculpatory evidence be turned over.

22

you think the assistant prosecutors didn't even know

23

that?

24
25

MR. COONEY:

Brady requires that
Now, do you -- do

Your Honor, I don't know that.

It seems from the record in this case they thought that
31

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

only something that screamed "exculpatory evidence" on

2

its face needed to be turned over.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Now, you phrase -

4

you are the instructor.

5

think is required by Brady that has to be given to them.

6

MR. COONEY:

You phrase the lesson that you

I think at a minimum it has two

7

pieces, Your Honor.

8

to go about fulfilling the Brady obligation, and how do

9

you go about looking through the file to make sure you

10

know what's there, making sure you have documents that

11

are in the possession of the police.

12

It has basic instruction about how

Thinking in advance, as this Court talked

13

about in the Agurs case, about what the evidence is

14

going to be at trial and looking thoughtfully at that

15

evidence to determine whether or not the evidence was

16

favorable to the accused and needs to be produced.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

That's your

18

instruction on Brady.

Now, you're basing liability on

19

-- on this incident of failing to comply with Brady.

20

you say they should have instructed on Brady.

21

What else should they have instructed on?

22

MR. COONEY:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So

Well You're the -- you're

24

the new DA, and you're setting up -- I need to instruct

25

my people.

What -- what do they instruct on?
32

Alderson Reporting Company


I know

Official - Subject to Final Review
1

they instruct on Brady under your view.

2

MR. COONEY:

What else?

I think the second thing that

3

the -- that the office really should do is to -- to talk

4

about the importance of safeguarding the innocent here,

5

that our job is not just to secure convictions.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I'm -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, we're looking

8

at -- we're looking at specifics where they're going to

9

violate the Constitution.

I think that's a good thing,

10

to tell them they have an obligation as well to protect

11

the innocent.

12

But we're worried about violations of our

13

constitutional requirements.

14

What's the next one?

15

We know Brady is one.

What's day 2 in the course?

MR. COONEY:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I do

16

think that there are other constitutional requirements

17

involved.

18

been brought before the Court as a parade of horribles

19

aren't actions by the district attorney.

20

Most of the hypotheticals, however, that have

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, with respect, I

21

really don't think, as a young district -- assistant

22

district attorney, that you have told me anything that's

23

going to be really helpful to me other than, you know,

24

follow the law, which you certainly should do, in

25

dealing with my obligation to turn over physical
33

evidence, which is what's involved here.

MR. COONEY:

I have this case, where I have got blood -- I have

9

has been no testing of it.

I have another

Now, do I have to turn over that physical
evidence?

In this case, there has been a

stipulation by the district attorney's office that you

do.

15

case -

16
17

And I think if you think about the evidence in this

JUSTICE ALITO:

I have to turn over all

physical evidence that's in my possession?

18

MR. COONEY:

No, Your Honor.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. COONEY:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

But here, the specific Now, what's the instruction

22

that you're going to give me to tell me where I'm going

23

to draw that line?

24
25

MR. COONEY:

If you have physical evidence

that, if tested, can establish the innocence of the
34

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

person who is charged, you have to turn it over.

2
3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, how do I know that

before the -

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

Didn't they make it available?

6
7

JUSTICE ALITO:

How do I know that before

the physical evidence is tested?

8
9

Well, didn't they here?

Suppose I've got all sorts of items that
were found at the -- at the scene, and they might have

10

DNA on them.

11

them -- you know, all this fancy forensic testing that's

12

done these days.

13

They might have epithelial samples on

Do I have to turn over all of that?

MR. COONEY:

No, Your Honor.

In this case,

14

what we're talking about is a piece of evidence, a

15

specific piece, several specific pieces of physical

16

evidence, that it has been stipulated the prosecutors

17

knew contained the blood of the perpetrator.

18

It -- the rule and the training that should

19

have been provided in this instance, particularly since

20

the DA argues that it was perfectly clear that that

21

should have been produced -

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, you see what I'm

23

getting at is that you're dealing with a very specific

24

situation.

25

physical evidence and you have tested it for blood and

So the instruction would be:

35

Alderson Reporting Company


If you have

Official - Subject to Final Review
1

you have a -- you have the result of the blood test, but

2

you don't know whether -- you don't know the blood type

3

of the accused, that -- that's Brady evidence, and that

4

has to be turned over.

5

And you're saying that the failure to

6

provide training to every assistant district attorney on

7

a question of that specificity gives rise to a -- a

8

potential claim, gives rise to a claim?

9

MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, what I'm saying is

10

I think there are at least three layers to the training

11

that were missing here.

questions, the response was:

And what -- where's the

10

Brady violation for telling a defense attorney there was

11

a blood sample there, you can test it?

that the request was for all scientific evidence, and it

The answer was:

It was -- the simple response was

"Inspection to be permitted."

Then the blood evidence, the very next day,

18

after the response was provided, was removed from the

19

crime lab by the prosecutors, never to be found again.

order to be talking about this for section 1983

purposes.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

My

18

understanding is -- I don't -- I'm not an expert in

19

criminal law.

20

understanding is that comments in a closing argument can

21

give rise to a constitutional violation.

22

I need training in that.

But my

So you should -- you should train those

23

people.

You know that.

You know that that can happen,

24

just as you know there can be Brady violations.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. COONEY:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So this is -- our

Justice Kennedy The -- the point of

concern here is that we're going to have to go through a

10

list, case by case, of everything there has to be

11

training on.

12

MR. COONEY:

I think -- I think there are

13

some important distinctions here.

14

when you're talking about search and seizure, when

15

you're talking about Miranda, you're talking about those

16

things, the actor that is committing the constitutional

17

tort there is not the district attorney.

18

police.

19

constitutional tort -

20

And, first of all,

It's the

What we're talking about here, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you're talking

21

about improper comments in closing argument, it is the

22

prosecuting attorney.

23

MR. COONEY:

But the second important

24

distinction, Your Honor -- and I do believe training

25

should be given there.

But I think there's a
39


Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

fundamental distinction between a Brady violation, which

2

happens in private and may never be revealed and, if

3

revealed, often happens long after trial and long after

4

incarceration, and a situation where a prosecutor makes

5

an improper comment during a closing jury, which is made

6

in public.

7

there to stand up and say, Your Honor, I object, and the

8

court has the ability to address that issue then and

9

there.

10
11
12
13
14

Defense counsel has the opportunity right

With a Brady violation, you don't have any
of that.

It's made in secret.

It's -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you don't -- you

don't have to train with respect to closing arguments?
MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, I think they do.

15

But I think there's -- there's a particular issue.

16

There's particular force in this context because of the

17

unique nature of Brady, because it's made in private,

18

because it is -- by definition, if the information has

19

been concealed, it has not been revealed prior to the

20

time the defendant suffers constitutional harm.

21

he's found guilty, he's sentenced to death, et cetera.

He's -

22

The Brady violation, unlike your situation,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't come to light, perhaps ever.

24

But in Mr. Thompson's case -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So we have -

40

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1
2

MR. COONEY:

-- more than a decade after he

was convicted.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it's something like I

4

was trying to get at before when I said Miranda is out

5

there, you know what was said, you know what was seized,

6

talking about -- but Brady is, if the prosecutor doesn't

7

come out with it, high risk it will never come out.

8
9

So we have use of force, plus -- that can
kill people if you're not properly trained.

Brady,

10

because if they don't come up with the information, it

11

could have what almost happened in this case.

12

Anything else on this special list?

13

MR. COONEY:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your Honor, I The concern was that you

15

don't want to have to give the prosecutors a clinical

16

law school course before you let them do their job.

17

MR. COONEY:

I agree with that concern, Your

18

Honor.

19

that in this case, this was a no-training case.

20

evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Thompson was

21

there was zero Brady training in the office.

22

And -- and I think it's important to remember

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

enough?

24

month enough?

25

So what would have been

I mean, is an hour a year enough?

MR. COONEY:

The

Is an hour a

I think that would have been
41


Alderson Reporting Company

1

dependent on what its content was, Your Honor, and the

2

other circumstances of the office.

3

If you look at Canton, what Canton does is

4

it asks the question:

5

training based on the circumstances of this

6

particular -

7

Is there an obvious need for

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait.

As I understand it,

8

you -- you really have a need to train them, when you

9

know defense counsel is coming over to look at the

10

physical evidence, don't remove from the locker some of

11

the physical evidence.

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

You want to give a course

in that?

15

MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, what -- what

16

happened is the physical evidence very conveniently was

17

being sent to the crime lab when it was removed.

18

we don't know what the motivation was as to why that

19

physical evidence was removed at that time.

20

know is for many, many months -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so

What we

Well, then, you shouldn't

22

have -- you shouldn't have mentioned it.

23

were -- you were asserting that it was intentionally

24

removed in order to prevent defense counsel from seeing

25

it.
42

Alderson Reporting Company


I thought you

Official - Subject to Final Review
1

MR. COONEY:

What we assert, Your Honor -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. COONEY:

You don't know that.

It was certainly not -- it was

4

intentionally not placed back in into evidence after it

5

came back from the crime lab, and there was actual

6

testimony from the grand jury that was handling this and

7

looking into this situation for some period of time -

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, there's a

--

10

MR. COONEY:

-- of not just that.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There is a causation

12

problem here.

13

going to destroy the evidence or remove it anyway, as he

14

admitted later to Riehlmann, then the training or lack

15

of training is just irrelevant.

16
17

Even assuming training, if Deegan was

MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, I think there

are -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

about that causation aspect.

20

MR. COONEY:

But I'm very concerned

First of all -- let me address

21

that directly.

First of all, the causation question was

22

put to the jury; the jury instruction very clearly said

23

in order for there to be liability here, the fault must

24

be in the training program, not in the individual

25

prosecutor.

And the defense argued vehemently that
43

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

there was a lack of causation.

2

is -

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's interesting here

But the judge actually,

4

though, instructed the jury -- this is back on J.A.

5

828 -- in order to find that the district attorney's

6

failure to adequately train, monitor, or supervise

7

amounted to -- deliberate indifference, et cetera.

8
9

So liability could have been predicated not
on the lack of adequate training, but the absence of a

10

process by which superiors in the district attorney's

11

office reviewed all of the Brady decisions that were

12

made by more junior prosecutors; isn't that correct?

13

MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, the concept of

14

monitoring or supervision was actually a concept that

15

defendants injected into the case.

16

extent that there is any concern that there's an

17

expansion from training, it's been error that's invited.

18

And I don't believe it's error, Your Honor, but it's not

19

something that -- that was put into the case by the

20

defense or the court.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so, to the

Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't

22

that be error?

That the -- the head of a very large

23

office is personally liable under Canton for violations

24

that are -- that are produced by actions taken by

25

subordinates, unless there is an elaborate process to
44

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

review all of the decisions that are made by those

2

subordinates?

3

Canton permits?

4

Doesn't that go well beyond anything

MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, again, the clear

5

thrust of this case was a failure-to-train case.

6

concept of monitoring and supervision was introduced by

7

the defense, not by the -- by the plaintiffs.

8

get back to Justice Kennedy's case -

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

But to

Could you please state

10

in simple terms to me what exactly they failed to train

11

these prosecutors to do, that the prosecutors didn't do?

12

What training -- Justice Alito asked it generally; I'm

13

asking specifically -- what is the exact training that

14

was required in this situation that caused the violation

15

in this case?

16
17

MR. COONEY:

Number one, there was

absolutely no Brady training at all.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Forget about no Brady

19

training.

What -- I think Justice Alito asked this

20

question.

What specifically would the training have

21

said or done that would have avoided this Brady

22

violation?

23

MR. COONEY:

First of all, I think a broad

24

statement in training about the importance of

25

safeguarding the rights of the accused 45

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, that seems to

2

suggest that you're claiming that if there was an

3

intentional violation by the prosecutors, that that

4

statement would have avoided the prosecutor from doing

5

something he or she knew was illegal.

6

you're intending?

7

MR. COONEY:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. COONEY:

Is that what

No, it isn't, Your Honor.
Okay.

So tell me.

The -- the second aspect of -

10

of it, though, is what I said to Justice Alito, and that

11

is that if you have physical evidence which, if tested,

12

would establish either the guilt or the innocence of the

13

-- of the defendant, it needs to be produced.

14

least tested.

15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or at

That goes to the

sufficiency -

17

MR. COONEY:

Right.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- whether they had a

19

policy to turn over or -- because it was tested, so

20

there was no Brady violation from the failure to test

21

here.

22

25

MR. COONEY:

The Brady violation was for

failure to produce; you're right.
JUSTICE BREYER:
right on this?

Isn't -- am I right -- am I

right.

of paper called the lab report came to the -- one of the

4

prosecutors' attention 2 days before the trial, and what

5

it said was the blood that was the perpetrator's was

type B.

7

Is that what happened?

Correct me if I'm not.

8
9
10

And the person on trial has blood of type O.

MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, certainly what the

crime lab report said was that the blood that was tested
of the perpetrator was type B.

11
12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the -- and the

prosecutor knew that the person on trial had type O?

13

MR. COONEY:

We don't know that, Your Honor.
Ah, that's something -

That's the unresolved factual

question.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. COONEY:

I see.

And I think that's where

19

causation comes in, Your Honor, because I think there

20

are two possibilities.

21
22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Did it turn out at the

trial that eventually the prosecutor knew it was type O?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I ask you what

6

In other words, the young

Would it have been an adequate training

program for this office simply to say, new prosecutors,

a year, and you're going to follow one of the

14

prosecutors around and learn from them?

MR. COONEY:

Is that an

If, in fact, the senior

17

prosecutors, Your Honor, have a good familiarity with

18

the constitutional requirements -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

MR. COONEY:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

-- absolutely.
Even -- even if the

22

violation that becomes the basis for the claim later on

23

is one that, you know, didn't come up in that year?

24

-- they didn't have a Brady issue in that first year.

25

They went around; they sat in on a lot of trials; but
48

Alderson Reporting Company


We

Official - Subject to Final Review
1

there wasn't a Brady issue and so they didn't learn

2

about this type of question.

And -

3

MR. COONEY:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

I think Does that give rise

to a claim of the sort you're bringing here?

6

MR. COONEY:

I think the failure here -- and

7

I think we have to come back to the deliberate

8

indifference piece because what would happen there in

9

that instance, Your Honor, even if the training was not

10

provided, I think as experience has shown under Canton,

11

that claim would fail for failure to show the deliberate

12

indifference of the policymaker.

13
14

But here you had substantial evidence about
Mr. Connick's indifference.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Cooney, when you -- when

16

you gave the specific instruction that you think should

17

be provided to assistant district attorneys, what you

18

stated was a questionable understanding of Brady, I

19

think.

20

You -- did I understand you correctly?
You said that Brady means that if the

21

prosecutor has physical evidence which, if tested, might

22

establish the defendant's innocence, that is exculpatory

23

evidence that must be turned over.

24

MR. COONEY:

25

Your Honor, that certainly has

been the position taken by the district attorney's
49

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

office in this case -

2
3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is that consistent with

Arizona v. Youngblood?

4

MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, I believe it -- it

5

is consistent with Brady that if -- if one has a piece

6

of evidence that can conclusively establish that the

7

defendant is innocent, that it can't be the law that the

8

prosecutor can just put it in his hip pocket, not get it

9

tested, and not turn it over to the defense, and not

10

worry about whether they're prosecuting an innocent man.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, you see, it was

12

tested.

13

Turning over -- using the word "turning over" is

14

ridiculous, because they're not going to physically give

15

it to the defense attorney to go off and do what he

16

wants.

17

establish a chain of custody, et cetera, et cetera.

18

And it was made available to the defense.

They're going to give it to a lab that will

So it was made available.

He went to look

19

at it, but the looking at it wouldn't have told the

defense attorney anything.

available for testing.

22

They did the lab reports.

23

only failure is in the turning over of this report.

Correct?

He never asked for testing.

MR. COONEY:

But the point here, Your

22

Honor -- and I think this goes to the causation point,

that -- that it would appear -- it would appear from

MR. COONEY:

No, Your Honor, I think there

11

is a difference between a tactical choice to do

12

something sharp, on the one hand, and a knowing Brady

13

violation, on the other hand.

14

And the jury could clearly conclude -

15

particularly because the 30(b)(6) witness in this office

16

testified that, in his view, it wasn't Brady material

17

unless the -- unless the prosecutors knew John

18

Thompson's blood type -- the jury could clearly conclude

19

that what happened here was these four prosecutors

20

didn't understand and never got a clear message about -

21

about what Brady required, and they -- they did not

22

produce this evidence.

23

There is nothing that clearly showed that

they committed knowing Brady violations in this case.

you have to be here 10 years before we let you have a

training?

14

That's all it says.

MR. COONEY:

Is that sufficient

I think, again, you would have

15

to look at the circumstances of the office.

16

with this -- this presumption against disclosure that

17

was present in Connick's office, that takes this case

18

out of the realm of the typical prosecutor's case,

19

because it is a bare minimum disclosure rule.

20

I think

I think there needs to be -- if you're going

21

to have that bare minimum disclosure rule, there needs

22

to be something to counterbalance it.

23

what the assistants testified to in this case, they all

24

knew what not to produce.

MR. COONEY:

Didn't he testify that it was

Your Honor, I think there are

6

two very quick answers to that.

550 to 551, which was Mr. Glas, the grand jury

8

prosecutor's, testimony.

If one looks at J.A.

What he clearly said was, during the grand

10

jury, when Mr. Connick decided to terminate the grand

11

jury, Mr. Connick and his first assistant were actually

12

arguing with Glas that if the prosecutors didn't know

13

John Thompson's blood type, they didn't need to turn

14

over the blood report.

15

So that's number one.

I think there is an

16

issue of fact that has to be resolved in our favor

17

solely from J.A. 550 and 551.

18

And the second is, Your Honor, the -- the

19

rule, the bare minimum discovery rule.

Louisiana law

20

did not require the production of crime lab reports in

1985.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART K. DUNCAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. DUNCAN:

Justice Alito and Justice

2

Kagan, you asked repeatedly questions designed to elicit

3

a response from my colleague:

4

ADAs with respect to training -- and I believe Justice

5

Sotomayor as well -- that would have prevented such a

6

thing?

7

What would you tell a

And I didn't hear a clear answer.
The legal issue in this case turns on the

8

fact that, in the deadly force scenario that Canton

9

marks out as the paradigm single-incident case, it is

10

very clear what a police office needs to tell a police

11

officer.

12

Tennessee v. Garner:

13

a reasonable probability of physical danger to yourself

14

or to others.

15

Here's the deadly force standard under
Don't shoot people unless there's

You've got to tell them that.

With respect to the Brady scenario, it's not

16

clear at all.

17

of course, training is important.

18

connect up a lack of specific training with a particular

19

violation that occurs?

20

Yes, of course, training is useful.

Yes,

But how do you

And having heard the argument, I'm -- I'm no

21

longer clear as to what the theory of the case of my

22

colleague's is about what caused the violation.

23

Whatever caused the violation, I haven't heard about a

24

specific training measure that would have actually

25

prevented what happened in this case.

How do you train them?

MR. COONEY:

I think the first thing you do

is you have a hiring process that emphasizes the

important of -- the importance of Brady, as this office

8

did.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Duncan, that I think you

13

can't say, because that's just overturning what the jury

14

found.

15

MR. DUNCAN:

I -- I don't think -- the jury

16

couldn't have found that that didn't occur, Your Honor.

17

The jury found that that was inadequate.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The jury found that there

was inadequate training.

MR. DUNCAN:

Correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In fact, the jury found -- I

22

think, if you look at the record -- the jury could have

23

found, a reasonable jury could have found, that there

24

was no training here.

MR. DUNCAN:

A reasonable jury could have

of inadequate training.

ingredients that lead -- that can lead to a deliberate

indifference finding on the basis of inadequate

6

What we contest is the

And what we say is that this case, that is a

7

general case about you failed to train on Brady, it

8

doesn't fit within the single-incident hypothetical.

9

And what I was trying to get at with -- with response to

10

your questions and Justice Alito's question was that, if

11

you can't say with any specificity, well, what training

12

do you give?

13

You asked repeatedly, Your Honor, how much

14

training is enough?

15

heard my colleague say that an hour a year may make this

16

not a no-training case, and so what you have there is a

MR. DUNCAN:

You can answer.

Thank you, Your Honor, Mr.

Chief Justice.
The correct resolution is the lower court

14

should dismiss the failure-to-train claim as a matter of

law because there was no demonstration of a pattern of

violations, and this situation does not fall within the

17

narrow range of circumstances that Canton foresees for

single-incident liability.
