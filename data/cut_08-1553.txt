ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. BALLENGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

From its enactment in 1906 until very

17

not discuss the Carmack Amendment, this Court agreed

18

unanimously on both reasoning and a result that are

19

flatly inconsistent with Respondents’ arguments here.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the government

21

told us in this -- in that case that Carmack wasn't in

22

the case because it was either waived or something.

23

the case was considered on the basis of, on the one hand,

24

COGSA and, on the other, the law of 50 States.

25

MR. BALLENGER:

That's correct, Justice.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

But

1

The United States represented to this Court that -- that

2

Carmack was not in the case, either because it was

3

waived or because the traffic was moving under 49 U.S.C.

4

section 10709, which of course is true here as well.

5

Our view has always been that this Court

6

wouldn't have granted certiorari purely on the basis of

7

a waiver.

8

Kirby was that it's very important to foreign trade and

9

to the uniformity of rules on a through shipment.

10

But in any event, this Court's reasoning in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but uniformity is

11

one thing when you’re talking about 50 States and

12

another when it's just two Federal statutes.

13

MR. BALLENGER:

That's absolutely true, Your

14

Honor.

15

Federal statutes have been construed harmoniously not to

16

overlap in this particular situation.

17

commerce is governed by the Carriage of Goods at Sea

18

Act, and the Carmack Amendment has always governed

19

purely domestic traffic and exports to Canada and

20

Mexico.

MR. BALLENGER:

Your Honor, I think that

this Court's task, as always, is to read the statute as

5

MR. BALLENGER:

They are, Your Honor.

The

6

simplest way to resolve this case is that the present

7

language, even taken on its face, requires a receiving

8

carrier that is a rail carrier.

9

"K" Line is the receiving carrier here.

10

They are not a rail carrier.

11

have long held that merely subcontracting for common

12

carrier service does not make you a common carrier.

13

This Court held that in the American Railway Express

14

case.

15

CSX/Sea-Land matter in 1987, where they held that the

16

ocean carrier Sea-Land was not a rail carrier simply

17

because it subcontracted for inland rail transportation

18

and provided carrier containers to the inland rail

carrier.

Carmack draws

11

MR. BALLENGER:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
And so that's what it has

to issue its own bill of lading, which would turn the

historic purposes of Carmack on its head.

4

The purpose of Carmack was to require the

5

first carrier in the chain to issue a single through

6

bill of lading to the destination that would govern the

7

whole voyage under uniform, consistent liability terms.

8

No one else in the chain is supposed to issue a bill of

9

lading, so there’s only one receiving carrier.

It's

10

the first carrier who deals directly with the shipper.

11

If you look at the venue provision, you can see that the

12

statute uses the term "originating carrier"

interchangeably with "receiving carrier," and it

14

provides venue over that carrier only at the point of

15

origin of the shipment.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I always thought

20

that the purpose of Carmack was to ensure rail

responsibility, rail carrier responsibility, so that it

22

was one bill of lading with respect to all railroad

connections.

carrier be providing transportation or service subject

14

to the jurisdiction of the board and issue a receipt or

bill of lading.

16

very beginning, its core purpose, was to allow a shipper

to sue the initial carrier.

18

responsible for the entire shipment.

19

carriers were deemed to be agents of the initial carrier,

20

and, therefore, there was an easy defendant for the

21

shipper, who dealt directly with that shipper -- that

22

carrier and received a bill of lading from that carrier

23

to sue.

between -- you know, part of a larger transit between
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the U.S. and a foreign country or even purely

2

domestically.

3

So, a shipper -- or a carrier that is

4

subject to STB jurisdiction has to be providing this

5

U.S. transportation when it issues the bill of lading.

6

So the -- again, the central purpose was to provide a

7

carrier by which -- against whom the shipper can bring

8

suit in a convenient forum, the person that the shipper

9

dealt with.

And that's now reflected in section -- the

10

forum provision of Carmack, which is subsection (d)(2),

11

it provides that a suit under Carmack may only be

12

brought against the originating rail carrier in the

13

judicial district in which the point of origin is

14

located.

15

that's a U.S. district court or a State court.

Those -- and the prior provision says that

16
17

Carmack itself anchors the transportation
as starting in the United States.

18
19

And then the third sentence explains the
remainder of the historic scope.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The third sentence --

MR. YANG:

This is back to 69(a).

It’s

23

Carmack, third sentence in subsection (b).

It defines

the liability under Carmack.

under this section is for damage “caused by the receiving

2

over whose line or route the property is transited in

3

the United States or from a place in the United States

4

to a place in an adjacent foreign country.”

5

So, what that does is that provides the

6

center for the two bookends.

7

originating carrier, the receiving carrier that receives

8

the goods in the United States, provides the bill of

9

lading to the shipper.

10

The first bookend is the

The second bookend is the delivering

carrier, and in between -- remember Carmack was intended

12

to cover the entire carriage as a unified whole.

14

15

in a foreign country.

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22
23
24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
It does not take great mental gymnastics to
read the plain language of this statute and resolve it
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the way the Ninth Circuit did in favor of Respondents.

2

The case is controlled by the plain language

3

of several Federal statutes, and they have been adverted

4

to, to some extent.

5

the Court that in 2-1/2 pages of our merits brief,

6

starting at page 26 and going over to page 28, we not

7

only cite the full language in full of the Carmack

8

Amendment and the jurisdictional provision of the STB,

9

but explain how Union Pacific is a delivering carrier

But I would like to point out to

10

within the meaning of the Carmack Amendment; under the

11

plain terms of the statute, they are liable for the

12

loss; the Carmack Amendment applies to their receipt of

13

the property; and the train derailment which was caused

14

by their negligence comes within the plain terms of the

15

Carmack Amendment.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then under that view, I

17

guess that -- that any intermodal transport, China, all

18

the goods coming from China, which tend to move under a

19

single bill of lading, as soon as they get to the United

20

States and go on a train for 50 miles, a new bill of

21

lading must issue?
MR. FREDERICK:

22
23

No.

In fact, this Carmack

Amendment --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. FREDERICK:

Why?
-- explicitly says, quote:

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not

2

affect the liability of a rail carrier."

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

they don't have to issue --

5
6
7

MR. FREDERICK:

Carmack --

All right, so you're saying

They do not have to issue a

separate -JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

If they don't have

8

to issue a separate receipt, what we’re talking about

9

is the bill of lading that was issued by the ship.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.
All right.

Now, if that's

12

correct and if the ship -- the only one that has to do

13

that, it says, is a rail carrier, and a rail carrier is

14

a person providing common carrier rail transport.

15

then that's defined to include intermodal equipment used

16

by or in connection with a railroad.

17

understanding -- which I'm asking you for correction

18

if I don’t -- is that the argument here is the ship is

19

providing intermodal equipment used by or in connection

20

with a railroad.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

And my

That's correct.
And it's the words "used by

23

or in connection with" that I am focusing on, because to

24

apply those words here seems to me to bring every

25

by people throughout the world are all going to have to

5

apply to meet the terms of the Carmack Amendment, which

6

had the purposes of railroads in the United States, and

7

that's going to be a nightmare.

And it means that the bill of ladings issued

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

No, it won't,

Justice Breyer.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, first, is it true what

11

I said?

12

contrary to the purpose and a nightmare?

And, second, if it is true why isn't it way

13

MR. FREDERICK:

It is not -- it is true and

14

not true, but for different reasons.

15

take a moment to explain, because I think it is

16

important.

17

And if I could

In 1978, the plain language of the statute

18

defined what the STB's jurisdiction is.

19

dispute that the last part of the jurisdictional

20

provision is the STB jurisdiction when a -- a shipment

21

is in, quote, "between the United States and a place in

22

a foreign country," but the STB only has jurisdiction to

23

the extent the transportation occurs in the United

24

States.

25

They do not

So it is true that imports into the United
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

States are covered by the Carmack Amendment, but only to

2

the extent of the transportation being within the United

3

States.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but why don't they have to

5

issue a bill of lading?

That's what they say.

So every

6

company, the Finnish company, Chinese, every company,

7

every shipowner, even if he’s never been to the

8

United States -- sad for him, but nonetheless -- every

9

one of those is going to have to issue a bill of

10

lading, whatever meeting whatever requirements are

11

there, and we know at least one requirement you think

12

applies.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Let me go back -- let me go

16

rule that would apply both to ocean carriage and inland

need to have a uniform rule that applies to both ocean

carriage and inland carriage, because we have this thing

called the Carmack Amendment.

3

of "rail" where "rail" includes all things that have

4

nothing to do with rail.

5
6

MR. FREDERICK:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so now we’ve got that

7

broad definition, and I would have thought we traced

8

through what has to be in the receipt, and then we get to

9

the -- that section and where it's exempt, because they got

10

-- want to get rid of it; then you have to put in -- you

11

have to put in a certain kind of waiver, which is very hard

12

to achieve. And that -- that's my understanding of it.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

It's the Surface

60 miles of train track with intermodal, multimodal

20

facilities that get the cargo containers which "K" Line

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, you would need to

8

reach the question of whether or not exempt carriage

9

under 10502 takes away the option of a 10709 contract.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that's a

11

different question with respect to liability and claims

Maybe now you could

Yes.

The STB, in an

authoritative determination that is entitled to our
41
Alderson Reporting Company

deference, has said that when it issues an exemption for

2

certain categories of rail carriage, which it has done

3

with the multimodal shipments, those exemptions remove

4

the possibility of a 10709 contract carriage.

5

And the reason for that is that, in both

6

situations, the rail carrier has to provide an

7

opportunity for Carmack-compliant terms to be given to

8

the shipper.

9

10502(e) says that the carrier must provide

If it's exempt cargo carriage under 10502,

10

Carmack-compliant terms in order to take advantage of

11

the exemption and contract under the exemption.

12

provides contract carriage, but only if the rail carrier

13

provides common carrier tariffs that a cargo interest

14

could ship under.

15

10709

Here, because the transportation is exempt

16

under 105 -- 10205, there is no common carrier tariff

17

that is applicable.

18

there’s no common carrier tariff applicable under

19

11101, then there cannot be an opportunity for contract

20

carriage.

it becomes a railroad carrier, even though its delivery

The Woodbury case

cases, this Court made the determination that the words

look at the statute, see what it says, and not have to

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF J. SCOTT BALLENGER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. BALLENGER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

12

Even Respondents can't really bring

13

themselves to say that Union Pacific is the receiving

14

carrier here.

15

somehow, UP could be liable as the delivering carrier

16

under Carmack.

17

carrier, there is no receiving carrier who is obligated

18

to issue a bill of lading under Carmack.

19

liable to under Carmack.

It's obviously not.

They say that

But of course, if "K" Line is not a rail

No one is

That is how the statute always worked from 1906

20
21

to 1978.

If the receiving carrier was not governed by Carmack,

22

as it was not in any import case and in any export case except

23

for Canada and Mexico, then Carmack did not apply to

24

anyone.

25

the midpoint, because that would turn the historic purpose

2

of Carmack completely upside down.

3

as mandating the commercial problem that Carmack was designed

4

to solve.

It would read Carmack

The point of Carmack and of through bills

5
6

under Carmack and COGSA is uniformity of responsibility

7

under consistent terms for the whole voyage in one

8

person.
And the reason is that in order to recover

9
10

from anyone, the shipper has to prove receipt of the

11

goods in good condition by that carrier, and if you

12

break the chain of the through bill, then you would have

13

to prove -- the shippers would have to prove that Union

14

Pacific, for instance, received the property in good

15

order, when as Respondents concede, all that Union

16

Pacific gets is a sealed container.

17

that point.

18

It has no idea at

And -- and so the shipper would be left in a

19

position at the end of the day; it opens the container,

20

there's damage; no one knows where it occurs; and there’s

21

-- there’s no source of law, no source of fact to

22

figure out where the damage occurred.

23

Respondents raise a lot of questions about

24

some track that they say "K" Line owns from Long Beach

25

to Los Angeles.

None of this is in the record, and it's

That's not "K" Line; it's an affiliate, and they

5

It's a Union Pacific

But the real point is that all of this is

6

far too late.

This case was decided on a rule 12(b)(3)

7

motion to dismiss for improper venue, and the lower

8

courts have made clear, sensibly, that if you are

9

confronted with a forum selection motion to dismiss, you

10

are required to at least come forward with any factual

11

disputes that you think need to be resolved before the

12

district court can grant or deny that motion.

13

too late to wait until the Supreme Court of the United

14

States, and say we have discovered some X number of

15

miles of track --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's far

How -- how do you get out

17

of the language that says that a rail carrier providing

18

transportation “shall issue a receipt” for property it

19

receives?

20
21

Now, the boat, oddly enough, is a rail
carrier under the definition.

22

MR. BALLENGER:

The --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, therefore, it should

24

have issued -- since you agree it's a receiving

25

character, it should have -- or -- it should have issued

a bill of lading, that then, if it's within Carmack, as

2

I've just tried to put it, requires it to have certain

3

things in it that they say aren't there.
MR. BALLENGER:

4

Under the definitions, a rail

5

carrier is a party providing railroad transportation.

6

And this -JUSTICE BREYER:

7
8

Oh, yes, right; and now we

see a rail carrier --

9

MR. BALLENGER:

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

No -You can get the definition

11

there, and it includes somebody who provides intermodal

12

equipment.

13

includes services related to that equipment.

And you look at transportation, and transportation

MR. BALLENGER:

14

The definitions of “railroad”

15

and “transportation” have always been defined to include

16

all of the equipment used by a real railroad.

17

doesn't mean that anyone who happens to own that

18

equipment is also a railroad.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. BALLENGER:

But that

For instance, the

Ah, now all right.

Fine.

The purpose of those definitions

22

from 1906 on was to make sure that railroads couldn't evade

rate regulation by overcharging for the use of a bridge that

24

it owned.

7

Okay?

So that's inter-service

What's the language that does it your way?
MR. BALLENGER:

A party providing rail

8

common carrier transportation, the scope of the -- of

9

that transportation is defined to include a container.

10

But that doesn't mean that everyone who owns a container

11

is -- meets the first part of the definition of

12

providing railroad transportation.

13

instance, everyone who owned a bridge or a track or

14

provided rail cars would be providing railroad

15

transportation.
