ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN E. SUMMERS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SUMMERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

We are talking about a funeral.

If context

11

is ever going to matter, it has to matter in the context

12

of a funeral.

13

in a private, dignified manner.

14

behavior made that impossible, Mr. Snyder was entitled

15

to turn to the tort law of the State of Maryland.

Mr. Snyder simply wanted to bury his son

There was a flier that was

on the Internet afterwards, which -

Well, what does

that have to do with the funeral?

MR. SUMMERS:

As the district court

2

explained, and the circuit court followed their logic,

3

and I think the facts at trial confirmed this, that the

4

epic was essentially a recap of the funeral protest

5

itself.

6

That's JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's fine, but it -- it

7

does not intrude upon a funeral.

I mean, no.

You -

8

you either have two separate causes of action -- one is

9

the intrusion upon the funeral, and the other is the

10

harm caused by viewing this -- this posting on the

11

Internet.

12

intrusion upon the funeral.

But I don't see how they both relate to

MR. SUMMERS:

Well, the And they were just

MR. SUMMERS:

Well, we had the flier that

17

was submitted, that was sent out before the funeral.

18

had the facts of the funeral.

19

of course, we focused on the personal, targeted comments

20

in the epic when we presented our evidence.

21

it was -

And, yes, the epic did -

But, yes,

Suppose there hadn't been a

Maryland passed a statute putting time, place, and

21

manner restrictions.

to me that there was nothing unlawful, nothing out of

3

Am I right that, under the current statute,
this conduct was not unlawful?

4

MR. SUMMERS:

Justice Ginsburg, the statute

5

wasn't in place at the time.

But there's a complicated

6

answer to the question, because they were positioned

7

about 30 feet from the main vehicle entrance to the

8

church, and they rerouted the funeral procession so they

9

were 200 to 300 feet away from there.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

they stand where the police told them to?

12

MR. SUMMERS:

Didn't they -- didn't

Well, they -- they told the

13

police where they wanted to stand, and the police said

14

okay.

15

They said -- in fact, they sent out a flier -

So the police didn't say, please stand here.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And they were there to

17

the knowledge of the police and with the permission of

18

the police.

19
20
21

MR. SUMMERS:

It's true they did not violate

any criminal statutes, Justice JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there anything to suggest

22

that the Maryland legislature, in enacting that statute,

23

intended to occupy the field of regulations of events

24

that occur at funerals?

25

MR. SUMMERS:

I believe the -- the Maryland

legislature made it clear that they didn't want people

2

to protest funerals in general.

They did prohibit it under

MR. SUMMERS:

For statutory enforcement.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if that statute

12

applies to any protest at funerals, protesting the

13

Vietnam War, protesting whatever, your case involves, at

14

least if we accept your version of it, a protest of the

15

-- of a dead soldier who -- who is going to Hell and

16

whose parents have raised him to go to Hell.

17

to say you can have a protest within a certain distance

18

is not to say you can have a protest within a certain

19

distance that -- that defames the corpse.

that's a different issue, isn't it?

7

MR. SUMMERS:

Could they have gotten an

I don't think they could have

8

beforehand because, although you said we knew what the

9

signs were going to be, generally from their pattern I

10

think we could guess what the signs may have been, but

11

you don't really know what the signs are going to be

12

until they show up.

13

a sign that said "Priests Rape Boys"; they had a sign

14

that said "God Hates You"; "You're Going to Hell."

15

For example, in this case, they had

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you could go into

16

court and say the signs were this, that, or the other

17

thing at the State Capitol, the same signs at Annapolis;

18

they're going to use the same signs at this protest.

19

MR. SUMMERS:

As -- Justice Ginsburg, from

20

our perspective, the signs that said "God Hates You";

21

"You're Going to Hell" referred directly to Matthew

22

Snyder, and we would hope and believe that the district

23

court could enjoin those types of specific targeted

24

epithets.

25

If, for example, this was done at a public

that it wasn't directed at the family.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did they have the "Going

7

MR. SUMMERS:

They had -- the majority of

8

the signs were the same, yes.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

But when you

Those particular ones

that you mention, did they have those at the other two?

11

MR. SUMMERS:

Yes.

I believe the only ones

12

that they changed were they have a sign for each

13

different branch of the service.

14

he -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Matt was a Marine, so

So it sounds like the

16

"you" is the whole society, the whole rotten society, in

17

their -- in their view.

18

MR. SUMMERS:

If we're forced to accept

19

their view, yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's what they

20

testified to.

21

Circuit, was that these "God Hates You" and "You're

22

Going to Hell" signs specifically referred to Matthew

23

Snyder and the "Thank God for Dead Soldiers" -- Mr.

24

Snyder certainly interpreted that as referring to his

25

son, because after all Matthew Snyder was the only

Mr. Snyder's view, the view of the Fourth

9

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

deceased Marine/soldier at the funeral.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where did -- you said the

3

Fourth Circuit found that those signs targeted the

4

family rather than the whole U.S. society?

5

MR. SUMMERS:

The "God Hates You" and the

6

"You're Going to Hell" sign were the ones that the

7

Fourth Circuit said they can avoid that issue, because

8

they can simply say this was hyperbolic and protected

9

pursuant to its interpretation of Milkovich under

10

defamation law and then its extension of

11

Hustler v. Falwell.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that the epic

13

is relevant as an explanation of some of these arguably

14

ambiguous signs that were displayed at the funeral?

15

example, "You're Going to Hell"; "God Hates You" -- who

16

is "you"?

17

light on who "you" is.

18

If you read the epic, perhaps that sheds

MR. SUMMERS:

It can shed light, but if you

19

put this in the context of a funeral-goer,

20

Justice Alito, what you have is -- it was a typical

21

funeral.

22

For

Family members driving in and JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, yes, but the signs say

"you," and the argument is made "you" doesn't mean

24

Matthew Snyder; it means a larger group.

have the epic, which is directed directly at Matthew
10

Alderson Reporting Company


And then you

Snyder.

2

meant on those signs?

3

Doesn't that show -- shed light on what "you"

MR. SUMMERS:

Correct, and that's where I

4

was going to go with that, Justice Alito.

5

specifically referenced Matthew Snyder by name,

6

specifically referenced Matthew's parents by name.

7

in our judgment, and the defendants testified that the

8

epic sort of explained, at least in their explanation,

9

explained the funeral protest itself.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

The epic

So

I'm not certain that this

11

is about the funeral.

I mean, I understand there was a

funeral in it, but the First Amendment question seems to

me a different -- possibly a broader and different

question.

He didn't read the content.

20

how does -- how did your client find out that the signs,

21

the tops of which he saw at the funeral when the

demonstrators were standing with the approval of the

police, 300 feet away -- how did he find out what they

objectionable things on the signs?

what they said?

specifics of the signs -

12

He found out about the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, that's what I'm

interested in.

13
14

How did he find out

MR. SUMMERS:

-- by going to the family wake

immediately following and seeing it on the television.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So now we have two

questions.

of people broadcast on television something about a

private individual that's very obnoxious?

point of view; that is very obnoxious.

21

is, to what extent can they put that on the Internet,

where the victim is likely to see it?

23

television or by looking it up on the Internet.

private things of a private individual?

Maryland's -- does Maryland's law actually prohibit

Do you think they can put

And what should the rules be

8

Have I said enough to get you talking?

9

10

MR. SUMMERS:

Yes, Your Honor.

11

Right now the rule we're stuck with is

12

Hustler v. Falwell for intentional infliction of

13

emotional distress, and the -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your -- your claim is

15

that Hustler was a -- Falwell was a public figure, and

16

the Snyder family is not.

17

your brief is you don't fall under that case because

18

you're not dealing with a public figure.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. SUMMERS:

I'm quite interested.

The private, targeted nature

7

of the speech, in our judgment, is what makes it

8

unprotected.

9

the family would be unprotected.

So, for example, the epithets directed at
If, for example, a

10

person repeatedly put on the Web site that Mr. Smith has

11

AIDS, whether it's true or not, essentially at some

12

point in time, it might rise to the level of an

13

intentional infliction of emotional distress.

14

would have to be other facts combined there.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There

You -- so you have

16

no objection if the sign said "Get out of Iraq" or

17

antiwar protests; in other words, not directed at this

18

particular individual?

19
20

MR. SUMMERS:

23

I don't think

there'd be -

21
22

Correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So no objection

there?
MR. SUMMERS:

I don't think there'd be any

24

constitutional impediment to bringing -- or the

Constitution would not -- would bar that claim from

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the intrusion upon the

privacy of the funeral is out of the case then, right,

personal attacks, aren't you?

9

That's not really what you're

You're complaining about the

MR. SUMMERS:

Yes, Justice Scalia, and I

10

think under a certain scenario, you could have -

11

regardless of the signs, you could have a scenario where

the funeral was disrupted, and it was disrupted in this

case.

directing public comments to a public or private figure?

So public speech, speech on a public matter, if directed

to a private person, should be treated differently under

the law?

18

was asking.

19

I think that was part of what Justice Breyer
Is that what your position is?
MR. SUMMERS:

Public speech, even directed

20

to a private figure, should be treated differently than

21

as directed towards a public official.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

And under

23

what theory of the First Amendment would we do that?

24

What case would stand for -- our case -- stand for the

25

proposition that public speech or speech on a public
17

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review

matter should be treated differently depending on the

2

recipient of the speech?

MR. SUMMERS:

public versus private figure status different, albeit -

Gertz v. Welch treated the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That was defamation,

wasn't it?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's defamation.

That's false -- truth or falsity.
MR. SUMMERS:

Correct.

But Correct, but the

10

problem is the only other case we have that deals with

11

intentional infliction of emotional distress from this

12

Court is Hustler v. Falwell, and Hustler v. Falwell

13

clearly dealt with a public figure.

14

interpreted Hustler v. Falwell as not applying to a

15

private figure.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The States have

But have they done it in

17

the context of differentiating between public and

18

private speech?

19

MR. SUMMERS:

Yes, there is an Illinois case

20

that we've cited in the brief where it was specifically

21

said it was a matter of public concern, and they said

22

the plaintiff was not a public figure; therefore, the -

23

just you have to meet the elements of intentional

24

infliction of emotional distress.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I was not talking about

18

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

State cases.

2

that suggested that we would treat -- we would treat the

3

First Amendment and the right to -- to speak on public

4

matters differently, depending on the person to whom it

5

was directed.

6

I was talking about a Supreme Court case

MR. SUMMERS:

I think Gertz v. Welch says

7

that.

Dun & Bradstreet says you have to at least look

8

at the context of the situation.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it always goes to the

10

context.

11

we look at the words on a sign alone, or do we look at

12

the entire context of what all of the other signs said

13

at the demonstration, to determine whether or not the

14

speech here was public or private speech?

15

Now, going to the context of this speech, do

MR. SUMMERS:

I think you have to look at

16

the particular signs, because if you don't, anyone could

17

come up with a public concern, because they could direct

18

any type of epithets at a person.

19

their paragraph they could say I'm for taxes or I'm

20

against taxes.

21

would be -

In the middle of

And, therefore, the entire statement

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, in that case -

Mr. Summers, I'm a little

24

concerned at your apparent acceptance of -- of the

25

proposition that if one comes up to a Marine and says,
19

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

you're contributing to a -- a terribly unfair war, that

2

that alone would -- would form the basis for the -- the

3

tort of intentional infliction of an emotional distress.

4

What -- what are the requirements for that?

5

I thought that it had to be outrageous conduct.

6

it have to be outrageous conduct?

7

MR. SUMMERS:

8

wasn't suggesting that -

9

Doesn't

It does, Justice Scalia, and I

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean -- I mean, why

10

accept that as -- as parallel to what -- to what you're

11

claiming here?

12

MR. SUMMERS:

And I hope I didn't.

What I

13

meant to say, if I didn't, was there would have to be a

14

lot more facts involved to rise to the level of an

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Summers, Hustler seems

12

to me to have one sentence that's key to the whole

13

decision, and it goes like this.

14

"'Outrageousness' in the area of political and social

15

discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which

16

would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of

17

the jurors' tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of

When members of the Westboro Baptist Church

wounded soldier and follows him around, demonstrates at

his home, demonstrates at his workplace, demonstrates at

outrageous things, and just follows this person around,

Does that person not have a claim for
intentional infliction of emotional distress?
MS. PHELPS:

Any non-speech activity, like

21

stalking, following, importuning, being confrontational,

22

could indeed give rise to a cause of action.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, if

the person is selected because, as I indicated, it gives

3

maximum publicity, rather than because of a particular

4

connection to the matter of public debate, I wonder if

5

that makes a difference.

6

MS. PHELPS:

I think it makes a difference

7

when you are looking at what role the plaintiff had in

8

that public discussion and how tied the words that they

9

seek to punish are to his role in that public

10
11

discussion.

I think that's how you get to the point JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Ms. Phelps, let's say

12

that we disagree with you as to whether Mr. Snyder had

13

at all injected himself into this controversy.

14

take a case where it's clear that the father of the

15

fallen soldier had not injected himself, had not called

16

any newspapers, had not said anything to anybody, but a

17

group knew that this funeral was taking place and was

18

there with the same signs, with the same -- are you -

19

are you saying that that makes the difference?

there, there would be a claim?

MS. PHELPS:

It is a difference that matters

2

in some measure, I believe, Justice Kagan, in this wise:

3

I believe that the umbrella of protection under the

4

First Amendment that this Court has established firmly

5

is speech on public issues.

6

that umbrella because it's a public official or it's a

7

public figure, but the umbrella that you give the

8

protection for is speech on public issues.

Sometimes you get under

Now, when a plaintiff comes to your Court

10

and says, I want $11 million from a little church

11

because they came forth with some preaching I didn't

12

like, I think it does make a difference for the Court to

13

look closely at what role did that man have in that

14

public discussion.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But your argument depends on

16

the proposition that this is speech on a matter of

17

public concern; is that correct?

18

MS. PHELPS:

Absolutely, Justice Alito.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

So let me -- let me give you

20

this example.

Suppose someone believes that

African-Americans are inferior, they are inherently

22

inferior, and they are really a bad influence on this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's -

Let's talk

15

about subjectively.

16

fighting words is -- you know, whether something is a

fighting word, that's a very subjective call, isn't it?

18
19

MS. PHELPS:

22
23
24
25

I believe that your cases give

some good light on that, Justice Scalia.

20
21

You're concerned about -- surely

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't think it's

subjective?
MS. PHELPS:

There may be in some people's

mind an element of subjectivity.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

My 20 years of -

You think that's solid,

absolutely, what's a fighting word; whereas, what is an
43

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

outrageous statement is -- is very much different from

2

what's a fighting word?

3

I don't see the difference.

Besides which, isn't it the case that in

4

order to recover for the tort of intentional infliction

5

of emotional injury, you have to substantiate the injury

6

with some physical manifestation, which the plaintiff

7

here had?

8
9

And, my goodness, for fighting words, you
don't even need that.

You can just say, these words

10

angered me to the degree that I would have been inclined

11

to fight.

12

physical manifestations.

At least for this tort, you have to have

13

Why isn't that a very objective standard?

14

MS. PHELPS:

Well, because the Court said it

15

was inherently subjective in the Falwell case.

16

think that the language that Justice Kagan brought

17

forth, and there's a few more paragraphs that follow,

18

identify why it's inherently subjective.

19

And I

And the way this case was tried identifies

20

why it's inherently subjective, where although two signs

21

and then three were identified as actionable by a

22

strange reading of those words, all of the preachments

23

of Westboro Baptist Church, including all of the signs

24

at that picket, all of the signs at other pickets, and

25

all their doctrines went to a jury with that inherent 44

But I see that in some

think.

See what you

Maybe you can think of some others.

3

You could have a judge make the decision,

4

since the First Amendment is involved, not the jury, and

5

the judge could say whether in this instance it was

6

reasonable for the defendant to think that it was

7

important to interfere with the emotional life of that

8

individual.

9

You could say if that was so, there will

10

still be no -- there would be no punitive damages.

11

There could be ordinary damages.

12

You could remove all protection from the

13

defendant in an instance where the defendant nonetheless

14

knew, actually knew, that they were going to cause an

15

individual who's private severe injury, emotional

16

injury, irrespective of their public message.

17

So what I'm doing is suggesting a number of

18

thoughts of ways of trying to do what I'm trying to

19

accomplish, to allow this tort to exist -

20

MS. PHELPS:

Right.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- but not allow the

22

existence of it to interfere with an important public

Thank you, Justice Breyer.

2

I'm taking that we are speaking now of the intrusion

3

claim, and I believe that I could offer you a compare

4

and contrast two extremes that may help us here.

5

And

On the one hand, you have a body of law that

6

comes under the heading of captive audience.

And you

7

can go into that body of law and read all those cases in

8

one sitting, so to speak, from which you would conclude

9

that it is very narrow, it is very limited, and there

10

must be some actual physical sound, sight, intrusion, if

11

you're talking about invasion of privacy.

12

At the other extreme, for a compare and

13

contrast, is what they seek in this case, what the trial

14

judge gave them in this case, which is:

15

unspecified period of time that each individual will

16

call their mourning period, no one, at any time, any

I believe, Justice

When the father used the occasion of the son's death to

8

put a question out in the public airwaves repeatedly.

Mr. Summers, could I ask you

16

-- a more standard antiwar demonstration -- "get out of

18

19

demonstration would be protected by the First Amendment

20

from an intentional infliction of emotional distress

21

suit.

22

You said that a

And I'm wondering why that is.

If you think

23

that what is -- what causes the lack of protection here

24

is the kind of glomming on to a private funeral, the

25

exploitation of a private person's grief, the -- the
54

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

appearance for no other reason than to gain publicity at

2

a private event -- if that's the problem, why doesn't it

3

also apply to a standard, you know, "get out of Iraq,"

4

"war is wrong" kind of demonstration?

5

MR. SUMMERS:

Justice Kagan, I say that is

6

a -- one, it's a much closer call, and, two, I would

7

look to the facts of the case to see if the funeral

8

itself was disrupted.

9

But that isn't the facts of our case.

The

10

facts of our case was, one, that it was disrupted, and,

11

two, that it's personal, targeted assaults on Mr.

12

Snyder.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, suppose it's not

14

disrupted and suppose -- and I know that this is -- that

15

you contest these facts -- that yours wasn't disrupted,

16

that they stopped when you started, that they were a

17

sufficient number of feet away from the funeral and so

18

forth.

19

So we're just talking the fact that there

20

are people who have -- who are appropriating and taking

21

advantage of a private funeral in order to express their

22

views, and they are in compliance with all the

23

content-neutral rules.

24

call and not the 55

it's not the personal, targeted nature of the attack on

4

the Snyder family that we have in this case.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So does that mean that now

6

we have to start reading each sign and saying "war is

wrong" falls on one side of the line, but "you are a war

8
