ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL KUMAR KATYAL

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

GENERAL KATYAL:

8
9

We'll hear argument

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This lawsuit seeks personal money damages

10
11

against a former Attorney General of the United States

12

for doing his job, allegedly with an improper motive,

13

yet the Attorney General, like the Federal prosecutor in

14

Idaho who sought the material witness warrant at issue

15

in this case, was performing the functions of his

16

office.
There are three reasons why the Petitioner

17
18

should not be personally liable for money damages.

The

19

first is because the prosecutor's act of seeking the

20

material witness warrant is integrally associated with

21

the judicial process and entitled to absolute immunity.

22

To view it any other way is to expose both line

23

prosecutors and high officials to lawsuits by highly

24

incentivized litigants based on their purportedly bad

25

motives.

That is something this Court has manifestly
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

resisted and for good reason, because improper motives

2

are easy to allege and hard to disprove.

3

suits to proceed would result in burdensome litigation

4

and interfere with the ability of prosecutors to do

5

their jobs.

6

Allowing such

The second reason is that the Fourth

7

Amendment was not violated, and, therefore, qualified

8

immunity applied.

9

statutory requirements of section 3144 were met in this

There can be little doubt that the

10

case, and, equally, there can be little doubt that the

11

subjective motivations of Attorney General Ashcroft or

12

the line prosecutor are thoroughly irrelevant to whether

13

a Fourth Amendment violation exists.

14

This Court has repeatedly rejected

15

subjectivity, explaining that otherwise time-consuming,

16

vexatious, burdensome, and, indeed, destabilizing

17

discovery and litigation would be the inexorable result.

18

And the third reason, and the easiest

19

reason, is that whatever one thinks the applicable law

20

is, what it -- it was manifestly not the law in 2003

21

when the warrant in this case was issued by a neutral

22

judge in Idaho.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I ask whether your

24

second reason doesn't boil down to saying that it makes

25

very little difference whether -- whether Ashcroft is -­
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is held immune by absolute immunity or by qualified

2

immunity?

3

GENERAL KATYAL:

Oh, no, it -­

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Once -- once you say

5

that -- that motive is not introducible with regard to

6

the qualified immunity question, and once you say that

7

he's using a witness subpoena, and you can't look behind

8

it as to whether he was abusing it for some other

9

purpose, is there any difference between absolute and

10
11

qualified immunity?
GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I take it there may

12

be a difference.

13

the absolute immunity question, which is the way that

14

this Court has historically handled questions when

15

there's an absolute immunity question and then a

16

qualified immunity.

17

We think the Court should first decide

I take it that the qualified immunity

18

question in this case is one about whether motivations

19

matter for the Fourth Amendment; whereas the motivation

20

question in the absolute immunity sense, as Respondents

21

see it, is -- is something broader.

22

the Fourth Amendment, per se.

23

prosecutor is -- has bad motives essentially or a

24

certain bad motive, an investigatory or purposeful bad

25

motive to engage in preventive detention, that somehow

It's not limited to

Their argument is if the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pierces the veil of absolute immunity.

2

something this Court has never accepted.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

That is

Well, I thought the -- I

4

thought the argument, rather, was that this is not as

5

close to the core of the prosecutorial function as some

6

of the other functions to which we have given absolute

7

immunity, and since it's so dangerous, since there is

8

such potential for abuse, we shouldn't confer absolute

9

immunity on this particular conduct.

But I don't

10

understand why if we agree with you on qualified

11

immunity, there is any difference whatever.
GENERAL KATYAL:

12

Justice Scalia, to be sure,

13

they are now making that argument in this Court, that

14

this doesn't fall -- this isn't intimately associated -­

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

16

GENERAL KATYAL:

-- with the judicial

17

process.

18

material witness warrants were associated with the

19

judicial process and that the only difference is that -­

20

that, here, they had a bad motive.

21

Below, of course, they said the reverse:

That

So I've talked about the bad motive point.

22

Now, with respect to whether this is intimately

23

associated with the judicial process, these are material

24

witness warrants being sought in connection with an

25

ongoing investigation by a prosecutor.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

It is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

quintessentially a prosecutorial function to obtain

2

these warrants and has been for -- for hundreds of

3

years, and it's the exercise of the prosecutor's

4

professional judgment, which is something that this

5

Court has looked to.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

6
7

pending when this -- when this warrant was issued?
GENERAL KATYAL:

8
9

Was the prosecution already

Yes, it was.

The

indictment of Mr. Al-Hussayen was in February 2003.

The

10

prosecutors learned in March that Mr. Al-Kidd was about

11

to board a plane and go off to Saudi Arabia for an

12

unspecified length of time.

13

immediately.

14

this warrant to secure this testimony.

15

essentially what prosecutors do and protected by Imbler.

16

To see it any other way is to expose prosecutors to

17

lawsuits for -­

They went to the court and said we need

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

They then acted

That is, to me,

Was Mr. Al-Kidd -- was he

19

released after -- I understand he didn't testify at the

20

trial, and there was an acquittal, and then other

21

charges were dropped.

22

material witness after the trial was over?

Was Al-Kidd still in custody as a

GENERAL KATYAL:

23

Justice Ginsburg, he was

24

in -- he was detained for only a period of 16 days total

25

in 2003.

Is -­
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

much longer -- for 15 months.
GENERAL KATYAL:

3

But he was restrained

He had travel restrictions

4

placed upon him until the trial was over and until the

5

government -- because after the resolution of

6

Mr. Al-Hussayen's case, which was acquittal on some

7

charges and a hung conviction -- a hung -- a hung

8

decision on others, the government thought about

9

retrying Mr. Al-Hussayen, took it very seriously, and 20

10

days after al-Hussayen's verdict by the jury, we reached

11

an agreement with them in writing that Mr. Al-Hussayen

12

would leave the country and -- and not come back, and in

13

exchange we weren't going to prosecute him any further.

14

And so, immediately -- I think quite soon after the jury

15

verdict, the -- the conditions placed on Mr. Al-Kidd

16

were lifted.

17

And I should say that the material witness

18

warrant statute laces into it a whole suite of

19

safeguards to prevent against -- as, Justice Scalia, you

20

pointed out -- the potential abuse for the -- for

21

material witnesses by prosecutors.

22

set up several different things to prevent that.

23

first is, in order to get a material witness warrant,

24

the prosecutor needs to show both materiality and then

25

practicability.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

I think Congress has
The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The second is that there are strict limits

2

placed on the conditions of the -- on the ability of the

3

prosecutor to detain anyone.

4

detention can only be allowed by a judge if, quote, "no

5

condition or combination of conditions will reasonably

6

assure the appearance of the individual."

7

Section 3142 says that a

And then there's a formal procedure where

8

they have a right to counsel, they have the right to

9

cross-examine witnesses, to -- to present evidence, to

10

proffer evidence at the hearing, and the like -- all to

11

show that they shouldn't continue to be detained.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in light of these

13

restrictions, I would like to come back to the question

14

that I understood Justice Scalia to be asking.

15

Court were to hold that obtaining a material witness

16

warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment where the

17

statutory requirements, and in particular establishing

18

materiality, are met, why would it be necessary for the

19

Court to decide whether there's absolute immunity when a

20

prosecutor seeks a material witness warrant?

21

GENERAL KATYAL:

For two reasons.

If the

Number

22

one is I think that's the way this Court has

23

historically gone about it, probably for reasons of

24

constitutional avoidance, to not reach constitutional

25

questions if there's an absolute immunity question.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And the second is, here, you have a Ninth

2

Circuit decision, Justice Alito, that says that -- that

3

absolute immunity can be pierced by a prosecutor's bad

4

motive.

5

material witness warrant cases but, indeed, virtually

6

any case.

7

pointed out, that kind of argument could be run by any

8

defendant who says you didn't intend to actually indict

9

me, or, you didn't care about that, you really wanted to

That is something that infects not simply

As we point out and as the dissent below

10

flip me to get testimony against some higher-up.

And to

11

allow defendants to make those kinds of arguments and to

12

expose line prosecutors and attorneys general to that

13

form of liability is an extremely damaging proposition.

14

The -- with respect to the Fourth Amendment

15

question about whether or not motive applies, I think

16

this Court has quite clearly said in Whren that motive

17

is not -- is not something that should be looked to,

18

that the subjective motivations of the prosecutor are

19

not -- are -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

But that's after there is

21

probable cause to suspect that criminal activity has

22

occurred.

23

they're not going to look behind probable cause.

24
25

And then you -- once you have probable cause,

But, here, the whole reason for using this
material witness statute is that there isn't probable
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cause to believe that al-Kidd did anything.

2

violation -- there was no violation of the law.

3

Whren is different.

4

The
So

It's a different case.

GENERAL KATYAL:

Justice Ginsburg, it's

5

certainly different in -- in that respect, but I do

6

think that difference doesn't matter, because I think

7

what Whren and Edmond and the cases were getting at is,

8

is there some objective, individualized determination by

9

a neutral judge?

And, here, as I was saying earlier,

10

there is quite clearly that laced into the 3144 statute

11

itself; that is, the judge must find materiality and -­

12

and impracticability of the testimony.

13

standard performing, I think, a long-standing government

14

function of making sure that testimony, important

15

testimony, is available at trial.

16

And that is a

So it is not like a situation in which the

17

government, just on their mere say-so, can put the -­

18

can detain someone on the basis of them saying, well, we

19

think this person has information.

20

strict standards placed on that, and, indeed, Federal

21

Rule -- Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 46 adds

22

standards to it by saying that a prosecutor must report

23

to the judge every 10 days about anyone who is detained

24

and assure no more detention is necessary.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think there are

I don't see -­

Alderson Reporting Company

So that -­

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How does that -­
I don't see how that would

3

make any difference to the -- at least to the absolute

4

immunity question.

5

absolute immunity if there's a statute such as this, but

6

there is not if there isn't.

7

core prosecutorial function for which he can't be sued

8

or it isn't.

9

as far -- as far as absolute immunity is concerned?

10

You wouldn't assert that there is

I mean, either this is

So what difference does this statute make

GENERAL KATYAL:

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

11

I was just answering Justice Ginsburg's question about

12

qualified immunity.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

14

GENERAL KATYAL:

I imagine one point about

15

the statute might be that the statutes, going all the

16

way back to 1789, do reflect that this is a

17

prosecutorial function to the extent there is any doubt.

18

So, for example, the 1846 statute said that an

19

attorney -- excuse me, an attorney of the United States

20

must apply for a material witness warrant.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So for us to agree with you

22

on absolute immunity, we -- we would have to believe

23

that even if there were no such statute and if a

24

prosecutor simply detained somebody as a material

25

witness without any check of a -- of an independent
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

magistrate, he would be immune?
GENERAL KATYAL:

2

I think that is correct,

3

that that is quintessentially what prosecutors do in the

4

exercise of trying to get a trial -- a trial going.

5

Now -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Suppose -- suppose that a

7

prosecutor reads the statute, there must be an affidavit

8

that says this witness is material.

9

irrefutable evidence that the prosecutor said to

And there is

10

colleagues and others:

11

person, ever, no matter what; I just want to ask him

12

questions.

13

because he is not material?

14

GENERAL KATYAL:

15

In that case, has the statute been violated

Well, if the -- if the --

I'm not sure I totally follow -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17

I do not intend to try this

case.

I'm not saying it's this

I'm saying it's a hypothetical case.
GENERAL KATYAL:

18

If the evidence shows that

19

the evidence is not material, then the statute is

20

violated.
JUSTICE BREYER:

21

And the reason it is not

22

material is because the prosecutor has no intention

23

whatsoever of ever bringing this person as a witness in

24

any trial.

25

GENERAL KATYAL:

I do think that that would

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

generally mean that materiality would be violated.

2

could imagine -­

I

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

4

GENERAL KATYAL:

-- some theoretical

JUSTICE BREYER:

If materiality is violated,

5

construct -­

6
7

does not then that -- that prosecutor -- since he had no

8

intention of bringing him to trial or of having him as a

9

witness at a trial, that prosecutor would not be immune?
GENERAL KATYAL:

Justice Breyer, let me -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- yes.

13

GENERAL KATYAL:

-- just make sure that I

10
11

let me -­

14

understand the contours of your hypothetical.

15

think that subjective motivations of the prosecutor go

16

to materiality.

17
18

I don't

So if -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, how does -- how does

GENERAL KATYAL:

Here's how I think it

it -­

19
20

works:

So I think that Congress set up the objective

21

two-part test to decide whether or not an arrest warrant

22

would take place, which is materiality and

23

impracticability.

24

simply, does the person have material information that

25

can be used that -- that's relevant to the trial.

Now, that isn't subjective; that is

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, if the person has a -- the prosecutor

2

has a subjective intent that says I'm never going to use

3

this testimony, then I think that that doesn't -- that

4

will -- that will almost always reflect the fact that

5

materiality just objectively hasn't been met in a given

6

case, but theoretically I could imagine a circumstance

7

in which the prosecutor has that subjective intent but

8

yet is material.
With respect to that, Congress has a

9
10

different safeguard at the back end, in 3144, and that

11

is the language in 3144 that says a judge in the

12

detention hearing is to inquire as to whether or not the

13

detention is necessary, quote, "if there will be a

14

failure of justice" if the person is released.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

And you can't look behind

16

that, right?

17

the judge has said it's material, that's the end of it;

18

you have absolute immunity, right?

19

You can't look behind that?

GENERAL KATYAL:

If the -- if

Well, I think that the -­

20

the defense can litigate that and appeal that set of

21

issues, but I don't think -­

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can appeal the -- the

judge's determination that -- that it's material?

24

GENERAL KATYAL:

Absolutely.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, then how can you have

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

absolute immunity?
GENERAL KATYAL:

2
3

Well, they did, because

we're talking about -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, you mean at the time

6

GENERAL KATYAL:

Exactly.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I see.

8

GENERAL KATYAL:

At the time itself.

4

it's issued?

think that's an important point, Justice Scalia.

But I
With

10

respect to absolute immunity, this Court has often said

11

that it is the crucible of the trial process itself that

12

often is a safeguard against abuse.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

Well, what if you didn't

14

have -- again, what if you didn't have this prescribed

15

judicial process?
GENERAL KATYAL:

16

I take it that the logic of

17

this Court's precedence is that absolute immunity would

18

still apply.

19

immunity isn't some rule to just protect prosecutors

20

willy-nilly; it's to protect the public.

21

Court said most recently unanimously in the Van de Kamp

22

case, that -- quoting Learned Hand -- that -- that there

23

is a cost to this.

24

will be harmed, but the cost of rooting out the bad

25

apples through damages lawsuits is far worse, that it

And the reason for that is that absolute

And as this

No doubt that certain individuals

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

causes prosecutors to flinch in the performance of their

2

duties.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

There is a difference

4

between calling a witness at trial and arresting a

5

person.

6

trial function to arrest someone?

7

protected absolutely is your use of that person at

8

trial, not your arrest or detention of them?

9

How is it a part of the prosecutorial or the

GENERAL KATYAL:

Isn't what's

No, I do think it goes

10

quite a bit further than that.

11

think Burns v. Reed -- and the relevant language is at

12

page 492 -- I think is -- is relevant because it says

13

that it's pretrial conduct, in order to secure the

14

testimony for trial or the like is -- is what is

15

protected as well, that it would be far too narrow to

16

just focus on the trial itself; and that would be the

17

contours of absolute immunity.

18

I think it -- and I

I think Justice Kennedy's opinion in Buckley

19

is also instructive in this regard, because what that

20

opinion says is that allowing only immunity for the

21

trial would just allow individuals to constantly replead

22

their allegations and focus only on the pretrial conduct

23

and be an end run around absolute immunity.

24

absolute immunity is important not for the prosecutor

25

for his own sake or her own sake, but because ultimately
17
Alderson Reporting Company

And, again,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that is what -- that causing -- damage liability will -­

2

will make prosecutors flinch the performance of their

3

duties more generally.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

You don't -- you don't

5

think there's a reason to make prosecutors flinch

6

against willy-nilly -- that's not what I'm -- I'm

7

claiming happened here, but if you take the point that

8

you're raising, then prosecutors can out of spite, out

9

of pure investigative reasoning, out of whatever motive

10

they have, just lock people up.

11

GENERAL KATYAL:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

Justice Sotomayor -­
And you're -- you're

basically saying -­
GENERAL KATYAL:

14

-- making prosecutors

15

flinch is -- is always a bad thing.

16

to is this Court's precedents that say damages liability

17

on prosecutors is the wrong way to go about it because

18

the costs are too high compared to the benefits, and

19

there are other ways of dealing with that -- from

20

professional discipline, as Malley v. Briggs and Imbler

21

said; to -- to -- to bar actions; to the crucible of the

22

trial process itself, which is a way of dealing with

23

that.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What I'm referring

Well, there are procedures

set forth in the statute, I'd say you would add, which
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you think are not necessary, but are there in order to

2

make them flinch in a different -- in a different -­

3

GENERAL KATYAL:

That is precisely correct.

4

We don't think those are constitutionally compelled, but

5

we do think they provide a very important safeguard.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What's your best authority

7

that at -- at common law or the common law tradition,

8

there is absolute immunity for witness -- for the

9

issuance of witness warrants?

10

GENERAL KATYAL:

I don't think it's come up

11

with respect to public prosecutors, and so our argument

12

here, to the extent the Court reaches that question -­

13

and, again, it wasn't -- it wasn't raised below in the

14

brief in opposition, but if the Court wanted to reach

15

that question, I think it would be that the argument

16

would derive the same way as the arguments in this

17

Court's post-Imbler cases, which is, as long as it is

18

intimately associated with the judicial function that

19

the prosecutor is doing, then absolute immunity should

20

extend to that context.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then a second question,

22

quite apart from immunity, just addressing the

23

substantive constitutional issues under the statute,

24

suppose that the prosecutor has probable cause to indict

25

and try the person for the crime.
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Suppose also that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is good reason to show that he would be a material

2

witness as to another participant in the crime.

3

the government have any duty to proceed with the

4

indictment, or can they just hold the person as a

5

material witness without indicting?
GENERAL KATYAL:

6

Does

I do think that the

7

government -- I'm not sure if we have any policy with

8

respect to that, but I think that -- that we -- that at

9

least for Fourth Amendment purposes, there wouldn't be a

10

violation if the government held the person for

11

essentially a dual motive, and that is what I understand

12

they have now conceded at page 31 of their brief, which

13

is in dual motive cases, the government's action is

14

permissible.

15
16

If there are no other questions, I'll
reserve the balance of my time.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you acknowledge that it

is then constitutional?

14

make me think you don't even acknowledge that it's

16

MR. GELERNT:

Your -- your opening comments

Justice Scalia, we are not

17

pressing that argument.

I would say that based on the

18

legal historian's brief there is a strong argument to be

19

made that it is not constitutional, with respect at

20

least to cooperative witnesses.

21

enacted in 1789 would not allow the arrest of any

22

witness unless they came voluntarily before the

23

magistrate and refused to even promise to return.

24

even a surety or a -- a surety or a bond was allowed.

25

So we do think there is a strong argument, but we are

The statute the Framers

not pressing that argument.
Our argument is that it cannot be used for

3

ulterior purposes.

4

can, with Justice Breyer's hypothetical that he posed to

5

the government, which is of course our hypothetical.

6

The government started out this case throughout the

7

lower courts and in the opening brief saying purpose is

8

wholly irrelevant.

9

probable cause to believe a law has been violated; this

10

And I just want to pick up, if I

This is Whren, even though Whren is

is Whren, purpose is wholly irrelevant.

11

We posed a hypothetical which we actually

12

think is this case and is consistent with our factual

13

allegations, that the sole reason this arrest was made

14

was not to secure testimony but to preventively detain

15

and investigate someone for whom there was no probable

16

cause or violation of the law.

17

That is -- is a difficult situation I think

18

to reconcile with Whren, I think an impossible situation

19

to reconcile with Whren, or with the text or history of

20

this statute.

21

The government has now come back and trying

22

to have it both ways and saying, well, the statute

23

wouldn't naturally allow that.

24

Justice Breyer pointed out, if purpose is truly

25

irrelevant why they want to make the arrest, the

But if purpose is -- as

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government should have answered "that would be fine.

2

The only things we need to satisfy are the objective

3

components of materiality and impracticability."

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is this a -- is this a

5

realistic hypothetical that you've posed?

Now, in order

6

to detain someone under the material witness statute,

7

that person, potential witness, must have material

8

testimony, not just relevant testimony, material

9

testimony, testimony that would be of some importance in

10

the criminal prosecution.

So your hypothetical is a

11

situation in which there is a witness and this witness

12

has important testimony that could be used in a pending

13

criminal case, and yet the prosecution has absolutely no

14

interest in calling that person as a witness.

15

How often is that going to arise?

16

MR. GELERNT:

Well, Justice Alito, I -- I

17

think a few points, one is just as an initial matter.

18

The statute has not actually been interpreted to go

19

beyond relevance, in the way you're posing it.

20

Interestingly, earlier statutes actually said the

21

testimony needed to be necessary.

22

that's actually an important watering down.

23

And so, that's -­

But putting that aside for the moment, we

24

think that what -- it -- it did happen in this case, it

25

happened after 9-11, I think that goes to the crux of
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

our case here.

We are not trying to fiddle with the use

2

of the material witness statute in the every day

3

context, and I think that's the point the Federal

4

prosecutor's brief is making.

5

What we are saying is simply that the

6

principle has to be that if you do encounter that

7

extreme case, this Court should not bless the situation

8

where it literally can be used as a preventive -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

The problem, and

10

it's, I think, the problem that I think Whren

11

highlighted is that the -- the allegation can so readily

12

be made in every case under the material witness statute

13

is that this is one of those bad intent cases, and the

14

case has to proceed so that we can prove that.
One of the ways we prove that is by asking

15
16

everybody who is involved in the process.

17

do this?

18

purpose of Whren is to make sure that kind of stuff

19

doesn't happen.

20

What was your intent?

MR. GELERNT:

Why did you

I mean, the whole

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but

21

let me -- let me say that I think I -- I understand

22

Whren, I obviously don't want to tell the Court about

23

its own cases, but is that it was drawing a conceptual

24

line, that the first point about Whren, and I think the

25

fundamental point, was the conceptual point that as the
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Whren court put it, only an undiscerning reader would

2

conflate cases in which there was probable cause of a

3

violation of the law with cases in which there wasn't.

4

So I think the Whren court is not saying we

5

wouldn't look at purpose.

6

of the special needs cases.

7

I think that's the teaching

Now, to your practical question about why

8

would this be hard to allege?

I actually think that

9

this is one of those unique situations which it would be

10

very difficult to allege.

Take the government's cases,

11

for example, that they've cited, like Daniels and Betts,

12

the material witness cases, you have witnesses being

13

arrested, not showing up for trial.

14

appeals made clear in those cases, they were the main

15

witnesses, not showing up on the day of the trial or

16

right before trial.

As the court of

17

It would be virtually impossible for those

18

witnesses to turn around and say the only reason I was

19

arrested was for investigative purposes.

20

that on top of the fact that this statute is used very

21

rarely, I mean what we have pointed out is other than in

22

immigration cases, which the person is already subject

23

to custody, there are only a few hundred each year.

24
25

And I think

And again, I think what the Green brief is
saying by the Federal prosecutors is, look, the settled
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

understanding of this statute among line prosecutors has

2

always been, you use it to secure testimony.

3

there's a windfall in the back of your mind that this

4

person might be a suspect, but you certainly can't use

5

it where you have no intention of using the testimony.

6

I think then the limitations on this statute become

7

meaningless.

9

I mean, take -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

Maybe

So every time the

prosecutor elects not to call one of these witnesses for

10

a variety of reasons, you would have a claim that this

11

wasn't designed to elicit testimony?

12

MR. GELERNT:

No, no, we don't think so,

13

Mr. Chief Justice.

14

said is that calling the witness or not calling the

15

witness can't be determinative.

16

you wouldn't want to create a perverse incentive to have

17

prosecutors simply call the witness just to cover

18

themselves.

19

more, and I think that's what we have done.

20

I -- I think what we have -- we have

I think one reason is

So I think you would have to allege much

I think there is an entire set of

21

allegations with respect to Mr. Al-Kidd, and they fit a

22

national pattern.

23

questions presented, the government raised an Iqbal

24

claim as to plausibility only as to a small part of this

25

case which is no longer part of the case, which is, was

And I would importantly say in the

Mr. Ashcroft involved in the specific statements in this

2

specific affidavit.

3

They did not allege that the allegations of

4

a pretextual policy were implausible.

5

before this court, it is not a question presented, and I

6

think it is telling that the government didn't raise it.

7

They are sitting on all the information about what

8

happened after 9-11 as a policy matter, and they did not

9

claim it was implausible.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just a point of detail.

Yes, Justice Kennedy, and I

apologize if I wasn't clear.

17

18

show is that roughly 92 percent of the cases are

19

immigration cases, where the person is already subject

20

to custody, and there wouldn't be any need to use it in

21

that pretextual way.

22

That what the -- what the

So what we're talking about is a few hundred

23

allege something like this.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do we -- do we -- do we

2

have statistics for the States, how many States hold -­

3

how many people are held under State material witness

4

statutes?
MR. GELERNT:

5

We have -- we have looked for

6

those, Justice Kennedy.

We have not been able to find

7

them.

8

more than 30 of the States have statutes that are much

9

more restrictive than the Federal Government, because

What we do know about the States, though is that

10

what they do is they follow what the framers did in

11

1789, which is to say the witness has to be given an

12

opportunity to comply, and that's what the framers did.

13

You have to ask the witness if they will continue to

14

comply.

15

of why it's impossible to ask them.

If they won't -- or you have to make a showing

So, I think in many States it won't be a

problem.

arguing here is, of course, well, our prosecutors are

I think actually, you know, the State issue is

But I also think what we're looking at are

24

States, local counties, cities where there may not be

25

the resources necessary to put checks on, and what the
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government's asking is for this Court to hold that as

2

long as you can make the minimal showings of

3

impracticability and materiality, which don't even

4

require the evidence to be important or that the witness

5

be uncooperative, you then can have any purpose you

6

want.

7

saying every member of this gang or every member of this

8

business must know some information about the person

9

that's been indicted.

So you could have States, cities, local counties

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

Your argument is that the

11

Constitution does not allow a material witness to be

12

detained, so long as the witness says in court that he

13

or she will show up for trial, no matter how much

14

evidence there is that this person poses a great risk of

15

flight?

16

that's the end of it, the person cannot be detained?

17
18

If the person says in court, I will be there,

MR. GELERNT:

Do I think the Constitution

requires that?

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. GELERNT:

Yes.
I think it probably does, but

21

we are not taking a position on that.

I mean, what we

22

are basically saying is that it is out of whack

23

historically.

24

could happen, where even if they said they would come

25

back, you could hold them.

It wasn't until the mid 1900s where that

So I think it's out of whack

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

historically, and there may be a real constitutional

2

argument.
We are not pressing it.

3

We are simply

4

saying that if it's used for its proper purpose, then we

5

are going to assume it's constitutionality, which the

6

Ninth Circuit did, but it can't be that it can be used

7

as a preventive detention.

8

official -- and I want to go to the qualified immunity

9

if I could -- would have seen that, because I think the

And I think any reasonable

10

analysis would have been the following.

You would have

11

pulled out Dunaway, and you would have seen that you

12

need probable cause to arrest someone, probable cause of

13

wrongdoing.
And you would have then said, well, we don't

14
15

have probable cause of wrongdoing, so you would have

16

pulled out Whren then, because Whren talked about

17

pretext.

18

conflate cases in which there's probable cause of

19

wrongdoing with cases in which the court has granted an

20

exemption from the probable cause -­

What Whren would have told you is do not

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

You might turn out -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you were writing

23

a law review article, you might have done that.

But

24

we're talking about an officer.

25

you would do is say, well, let me see these material

I think the first thing

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

witness statute cases, and what would he have found?
MR. GELERNT:

Well, I think what he would

3

have found, Your Honor, is that the Court has not

4

specifically -- I grant that it has not specifically

5

ruled on the Fourth Amendment, but what he would have

6

found in Barry and the other cases, is that the Court

7

repeatedly, repeatedly referred to statute as a means of

8

securing testimony.

9

So I think the reasonable official would

10

have said to themselves, well, it's clear under the

11

Fourth Amendment that I don't have probable cause, but

12

maybe the statute is allowing me to do it.

13

Now, first of all, it statute can't

14

authorize a Fourth Amendment violation.

15

that aside, just a -­

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But putting

But, again, you're

17

talking about the officer, he reads the statute and then

18

doesn't say, well, but maybe the statute's

19

unconstitutional, so I need to do more research?

20

MR. GELERNT:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And I

21

think what the research would have been done, they would

22

have looked at Barry and all this Court's other cases

23

and would have specifically said it's to secure

24

testimony, and then I think a reasonable official would

25

have looked at the text of the statute, everything in
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the text of the statute is about securing testimony,

2

including the deposition requirement, you must be

3

released if your deposition is taken, you must have a

4

deposition.
All of those things do not suggest -- if the

5
6

government's interests could be simply we want to hold

7

this person because for preventive detention reasons,

8

none of the statute would make sense.

9

reasonable official could not have turned to this

I think that a

10

statute and said, yes, I'm looking at the statute, and

11

it seems like I can use it for whatever reason I want.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

So the eight -­

13

eight judges taking the opposite position in the hearing

14

en banc below were just being unreasonable?

15

have been unreasonable for an officer making this

16

determination to agree with eight judges from the Ninth

17

Circuit?
MR. GELERNT:

18

It would

I think, Your Honor, the --

19

Mr. Chief Justice, the only way I can answer that is to

20

say this Court has -- has never made determinant of

21

whether there are dissents.

22

this Court, two justices of this Court descended on

23

merits and yet you still found that the law was clearly

24

established.

25

I mean, take the Brogue in

32
Alderson Reporting Company

What we said in

1

Wilson, I'm quoting, judges -- when judges disagree on a

2

constitutional question, it is unfair to subject public

3

employees to money damages for picking the losing side

4

of the controversy.

5

MR. GELERNT:

I mean, but I think Brogue

6

goes the other way.

7

Mr. Chief Justice, is I think that the -- the fact that

8

there were dissenters can't be dispositive, and

9

ultimately this -­

10

Ultimately, all I can say,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I agree

11

with -- I agree with that, of course, but at the same

12

time, it does seem that you're imposing a very heavy

13

burden on the officers in this area when do you have a

14

situation where eight judges, when they conduct their

15

research, come out the other way.

16

burden is particularly heavy when you're talking about

17

if they guess wrong, it comes out of their pocket.

18

if I'm the officer in that situation, I say, well, I'm

19

just not going to run the risk of, you know, having to

20

sell the house because I agreed with eight judges on the

21

Court of Appeals.

22

MR. GELERNT:

And that type of

And

Well, Your Honor, I think -­

23

you know, of course, I'm not sure it will actually come

24

out of their pocket, but I get the crux of your point.

25

I do think ultimately, though, that this is a situation
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where a reasonable official would have had to say to

2

themselves:

3

Because I want to be very clear about our position and

4

how narrow it is.

I can use this as preventative detention.

5

We would concede, for purposes of this

6

argument, that if they wanted to use this for dual

7

motives, then there would have been a real question

8

there.

9

that's what the statute talks about, but we also hope

If they said, look, we want the testimony,

10

that maybe something else will come out of it, that's a

11

closed question.

12

themselves, which is all we're saying this case is

13

about, is:

14

Justice Breyer's hypothetical, there's clear, objective

15

evidence.

16

it's counterproductive in our case; we're not going to

17

use this testimony, but we would like to hold the

18

person.

19

official to say to themselves, this statute grants me

20

preventive detention powers.

21

But if they would have said to

Look, we don't want this testimony.

In

We don't want to use this testimony, perhaps

I think that is very difficult for a reasonable

I mean, I think you would be looking at a

22

statute going back to 1789 that this Court has

23

repeatedly commented on that is only about testimony.

24

You would be saying to yourself, this statute allows me

25

to engage in preventive detention even though Congress
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has never passed a statute like that, Congress

2

specifically rejected preventive detention powers -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

3

You don't think that an

4

official reading all this Court's cases saying

5

subjective motivation is not proper in determining the

6

application of the Fourth Amendment would be able to

7

think that this would apply here, too?

8

motivation doesn't count here; what counts is whether

9

there's -- there are objective criteria that would

10

Subjective

permit the detention?
MR. GELERNT:

11

I don't think so, Justice

12

Alito, respectfully.

I think when you pulled out Whren,

13

which, of course, is this Court's landmark decision on

14

pretext -- Whren could not have been clearer.

15

specifically said only an undiscerning reader would

16

conflate the two.

17

Whren was making is straightforward.

The Court

And I think the conceptual point

The Fourth Amendment says you need probable

18
19

cause or a violation of the law to arrest someone.

If

20

the government wants to walk in and ask for an exemption

21

from that standard and says, the reason we want the

22

exemption is because of the purpose of the arrest, then

23

the Court in Whren said, well, then they must adhere to

24

the purpose.

25

the probable cause.

Otherwise, it's simply an end-run about

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I mean, consider two cases -­

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the Fourth Amendment

3

doesn't say you need probable cause.

There are

4

situations where you can conduct a search without

5

probable cause.

6

administrative searches.

7

MR. GELERNT:

There's the Terry search.

There's

There's a lot of exceptions.
Yes, Justice Scalia, but I

8

think -- well, the Terry -- the Terry stops, I think we

9

put to one side, because as the Court in Terry said and

10

as this Court has interpreted Terry, those were because

11

those were not full-scale arrests and the

12

administrative -- sorry.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

13
14

Administrative searches,

automobile searches, you know.
MR. GELERNT:

15

Absolutely, and those all fall

16

into the special needs category, and those were cases

17

you, Your Honor, in Whren distinguished as conceptually

18

different than when there's probable cause of a

19

violation of law, because what you yourself said in

20

Whren was:

21

exemption from the traditional Fourth Amendment standard

22

and they're saying the reason we want the exemption is

23

because of the purpose of our search.

24
25

Look, the government is asking for an

You said, well, then, of course we're going
to hold the government to that purpose.
36
Alderson Reporting Company

They can't tell

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

us, look, we don't want to meet the Fourth Amendment

2

standard because of the purpose of what we're doing, but

3

then turn around and not adhere to the purpose.
And so if you had two cases, one where

4
5

there's probable cause of wrongdoing and another case

6

where there wasn't, the judge would say fine to the

7

first one and then he would say to you, well, the second

8

one, you don't have probable cause.

9

government could say at that point was, well, that's

true, but we're not trying to investigate or prosecute

11

the person as in Dunaway.

12

Maybe it's administrative.

13

testimony.

14

something else.

15

then go ahead and do that search on less than probable

16

cause, if that's your purpose, you couldn't turn around

17

then and not -- and then not adhere to that purpose.

18

mean, I think that's what we're talking about, is

19

that -­

20

We have a different purpose.
Maybe it's to secure

Maybe it's

And then if the Court said, well, fine,

JUSTICE ALITO:

You seem to acknowledge that

21

in -- a dual motive case would not violate the Fourth

MR. GELERNT:

Do you think that a

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reasonable official would appreciate, well, it's okay

2

for me to have a dual motive, but I have to stop and

3

think:

4

further the but-for cause of my desire to get a material

5

witness warrant?

Is my interest in investigating this individual

Do you think that was apparent?

MR. GELERNT:

6

I think it actually is, Your

7

Honor, and the reason is because I think it's -- I think

it actually gives cushion to the reasonable official,

9

because I think once you are saying we want to secure

10

testimony, it might be very difficult, as the Chief

11

Justice was pointing out, to say, well, how I do know if

12

I could have ulterior motives or not?

13

very difficult situation.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not sure why that just

2

can't be resolved under the issue of materiality.

3

magistrate asks the prosecutor why he wants to do this,

4

and he infers from what the prosecutor said that -- just

5

what you say.

6

Then it's not material.

MR. GELERNT:

The

It's not a case.

That goes to the crux of, I

7

think, what is going on here.

We have said that both

8

the Fourth Amendment and the materiality as well as

9

other parts of the statute would deal with it precisely.

10

The government's opening brief and throughout the lower

11

courts said, no, it doesn't matter if you're going to

12

use the testimony or not or we have any intention.

13

We posed that hypothetical in our brief.

14

The government came back and said, well, maybe that

15

could be done with materiality.

16

going to stick to their position, their conceptual

17

position, they would have come back and said, look, the

18

objective components of materiality and of

19

practicability have been satisfied, because he's taking

20

a trip and he worked for the same charity, and who cares

21

whether -- so if the Court is prepared to put a limit

22

on, you have to use this for its stated purpose,

23

testimony, that's all we're asking for.

24

case has changed now because of the concession that the

25

government's made on pages bottom of 15, top of 16,

If the government was

39
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where they're now saying, yeah, that is a tough

2

situation, and maybe we can deal with that through the

3

statute.

But that's all we're saying.
The Ninth Circuit understood this as a sole

4
5

motive case.

The government understood it in their cert

6

petition and in their brief to this Court as a sole

7

motive case.

8

is a but-for, but we're prepared to go with sole motive,

9

and our allegations, our factual allegations, are

We have said we think the analytical test

10

consistent.

11

we don't think this Court can bless it.

12

practicability in some objective way; you don't care

13

whether you're going to use the testimony, you may have

14

no use for it, but it's an end-run around locking people

15

up.

16
17
18

In the proposition, we are simply saying,

JUSTICE ALITO:

You satisfy

Where did you allege that

the desire to detain was the sole motive for this?
MR. GELERNT:

Your Honor, I think that the

19

clearest allegations are at 111 and 112 and 154 of our

20

complaint, in the joint appendix.

21

was not to secure testimony.

22

Circuit certainly understood it that way at pages -- I

23

apologize -- 25A and 40A of the opinion.

24

government, in its cert petition and its brief,

25

understood it that way in saying, we don't know how the

What we said is it

And I think the Ninth

40
Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Ninth Circuit would deal with a mixed motive case,

2

clearly suggesting that the Ninth Circuit was a sole

3

motive case; and so again, all we are saying is it

4

cannot be that this statute be transformed into a

5

preventive detention statute, and I think particularly

6

so because the government after 9-11 specifically -- as

7

the green brief notes -- specifically asked Congress for

8

preventive detention power, and that power was denied.

9

What they granted was a very limited 7-day hold only for

10

noncitizens.
And so I think what we're talking about in

11
12

many respects -- at a macro level is a separation of

13

powers case as much as a Fourth Amendment.

14

not -- it's not dissimilar to the dialogue this Court

15

has been having in the Guantanamo cases with, look, you

16

need to go beyond the Fourth Amendment; if you think you

17

need such a fundamental change to our country's

18

traditions, Congress is going to have to take the first

19

step, we'll look at it and there will be a back and

20

forth.

21

I think it's

But here what happened was the preventive

22

detention powers were denied and yet the government

23

still went ahead and used the material witness statute.

24

And again, I can't stress enough that the government did

25

not raise an Iqbal claim as to the plausibility of these
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

allegations.

Only now in the reply brief where they're

2

-- they're trying to address a sole motive situation, or

3

a but-for, which is all we're asking this Court to

4

address, the government has now said the allegations are

5

implausible.
I think that in many situations -- you know,

6
7

with the absolute immunity point, if I could just turn

8

to that for a second -- the history, as you said,

9

Justice Kennedy, the government has conceded they don't

10

have a case on their side.

11

which, as the historians' brief points out, and as our

12

brief points out, in which there was not immunity for

13

the arrest of a -- for the arrest of a witness, which is

14

very different than calling a witness, Justice

15

Sotomayor.

16

We have plenty of cases in

And what we are talking about here also is

17

the government's burden.

18

something we could have -- we could have waived,

19

especially since the Ninth Circuit addressed it and put

20

the government on notice that the government came

21

forward with no historical evidence; and it's not

22

inconsistent with warrants generally.

23

So I don't think that's

As this Court made clear in Malley, it

24

surveyed the history of arrest warrants and said, look,

25

arrest warrants, there's no history; we're not going to
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

grant absolute immunity for arrest warrants.

In Burns,

2

Justice Scalia pointed out that there is no history with

3

respect to search warrants, and I think the history with

4

respect to material witness warrants is even clearer.

5

So what we're talking about is no history; we're talking

6

about a fairly ancillary and rarely used process to the

7

criminal justice system, and one we're talking about

8

where there's sort of a unique confluence of factors

9

where you have someone who is not the defendant in the

10

trial, who is a third party, and their liberty is being

11

deprived; and it's the type of statute that can be

12

abused.

13

it's a dual -- it's a dual motive type statute; and so

14

that because it can be inherently abused, there has to

15

be some checks on it.

I mean, I think the government's whole point is

16

And this Court has never said that you would

17

have absolute immunity for all prosecutors in all cases.

18

We are certainly not raising a motive case with respect

19

to absolute immunity.

20

the Court's test in absolute immunity, which is the

21

functional approach, you have to make that threshold

22

determination about whether something is investigative

23

or not; and I think that's the teaching of Buckley.

24

Take two witness interviews.

25

the prosecutor clearly can be engaged in interviews for

What we are simply applying is

They're the same act, but

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

different reasons.
In Buckley, it happened to be on those facts

2
3

the Court believed it was investigative, based on the

4

allegations in the complaint.

5

days before the presentment to the grand jury?

6

likely the prosecutor would have assumed he had probable

7

cause at that point and was prepping the witnesses.

It's

Those are two acts, but you have to look

8
9

But what if it were 2

behind them.

I think there's no way around looking

10

behind.

The alternative, the flip side of what the

11

government's asking, is:

You're saying

prosecution purely for harassment purposes?

beyond.

MR. GELERNT:

8
9

That's what I thought you

I think what's going on here

is there's a unique set of factors with respect to

10

material witness, not the least of which is the history

11

with respect to both material witness arrests and

12

warrants generally, and I think there's been no

13

counter-history by the government.
JUSTICE ALITO:

14
15

I think back -­

We're dealing here with a

Bivens action?

16

MR. GELERNT:

Yes, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Under what theory is the

18

history of immunity at some point in the 19th century

19

relevant to the scope of the immunity that should be

20

available in a -- in a Bivens action?

21

for that?
MR. GELERNT:

22

What's the theory

Well, Your Honor, I think -- I

23

don't know that I have an independent first principles

24

theory.

25

will keep the immunities coterminous and you will look

I think this Court has said repeatedly that you

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

to the history in both cases.
JUSTICE ALITO:

So that's the Butz case.

Does that make any sense?

I

3

can understand it with respect to 1983, on the theory

4

that when Congress passed the predecessor of that

5

statute it implicitly intended to adopt the immunities

6

that were available at the time; but when this Court

7

invented the Bivens claim -- in when -- 1971 or

8

whatever -- that the Court -- the Court was -- committed

9

itself to recognizing only those immunities that were

10
11

available at the time when 1983 was adopted?
MR. GELERNT:

I think, you know, part of

12

what the Court's answer is, it's a practical concern.

13

That it's just too difficult to have different

14

immunities, and the Court -- so the Court has repeatedly

15

reaffirmed that, and I think from a policy standpoint, a

16

practical standpoint, it's felt that that's the right

17

analysis, and there has to be some way to tether the

18

immunity analysis; and history is ultimately, I think -­

19

what the Court has said it's a necessary though not

20

sufficient, and that once you sort of unmoor it from

21

history, it becomes very difficult to keep the two.

22

So I think what we're talking about here is

23

a -- a statute that had enormous consequences.

24

third parties who have been cooperative, even, who have

25

done nothing wrong, that end up in jail, and to say that
46
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is going to be absolute immunity is very

2

dangerous.

3

thumb has to be on the scale against absolute immunity.

4

That's an extraordinary protection, and if there's

5

anywhere where there needs to not be complete

6

insulation, it would be where you have third parties,

7

and -- who are going to jail.

This Court has repeatedly said that the

granted, it's been the defendant in the full judicial

15

process.

Now, Mr. Al-Kidd did sue other

2

people, including the warden who was responsible for

3

that, and I think that there have been other ancillary

litigation with -- with respect to that, but to hold

5

either the Attorney General or prosecutors liable is

6

something that would, I think, ultimately open the door

7

to, at least there are a few hundred lawsuits at the

8

Federal level if not more.
JUSTICE BREYER:

9

I would like to go back to

10

the statute.

If an officer fills out an affidavit for a

11

search and says there were drugs in the house, so I want

12

to search it, and it turns out he was lying, you would

13

have a damages action?

GENERAL KATYAL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, yes.

GENERAL KATYAL:

-- you have -- you

potentially have a damages against the officer, not

against the prosecutor?

officer, because he told a lie.

21

GENERAL KATYAL:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now here it

23

says that the person filling out the affidavit has to

24

say he is a material witness.

25

plaintiffs were to prove that the individual who signed

So suppose that the

that was not telling the truth in saying he is a

but there was no possibility he would call this

with law enforcement?

to look at the 1846 statute, which didn't require
