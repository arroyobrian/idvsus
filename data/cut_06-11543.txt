ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET A. KATZE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. KATZE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether DWI is a

11

violent felony for purposes of an Armed Career Criminal

12

Act sentencing enhancement.

13

takes the statutory sentencing range from zero to 10

14

years and raises it to 15 years to life.

15

the Armed Career Criminal Act is to punish most severely

16

that category of recidivist violent offenders who are

17

disproportionately responsible for the violent crimes

18

and who, when they possess a weapon, are more dangerous.

19

The government is trying to expand the reach

20

of the statute by so broadly reading the residual clause

21

as to include any crime that presents a serious

22

potential risk of injury to another.

23

Sentencing enhancement

The intent of

Such a reading of that residual clause would

24

swallow the entire statute.

Congress had no intention

25

of including DWI within the ambit of the Armed Career

MS. KATZE:

Your Honor, I think what you

22

said was sufficient, but you might have added that there

23

are other attributes to the -- the crimes in the -- the

24

enumerated crimes, those being burglary, arson,

25

extortion, use of explosives.

There are certain

attributes that they share in common that DWI does not

2

share, and those would include those, as you stated, an

3

active violent crime.

all property crimes, as this Court said in Taylor.

5

But in addition to that, they're

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think you can say that

3

all of the crimes that are listed require mens rea and

4

DUI doesn't; does it?

5

MS. KATZE:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

Absolutely.

That's a big different,

isn't it?

8
9

Absolutely.

MS. KATZE:

I think it's a huge difference.

DUI -- DUI in New Mexico is a strict liability crime.

10

It has no mens rea whatsoever.

12

have a case in New Mexico where a woman had taken Ambien

13

and was driving, and she didn't even know she was

14

driving, but she still was convicted because she merely

15

was in control of the vehicle.

16

strict liability crime where you don't even have to know

17

you're driving, as opposed to the four enumerated

18

offenses, where there is clearly some intent to cause

19

some harm -

So in New Mexico, a

Would you have the same

answer if you had a State statute which defined felony

23

causes serious death or serious physical injury to

24

another?

There would be an additional

You would still say that

MS. KATZE:

there is just merely harm that's caused -

No, there isn't in the

usual felony drunk driving statute, there is MS. KATZE:

And I agree.

I think in that

case, then that also would not fall within the statute.

12

There is not the intent to cause harm.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the crime is

14

vehicular homicide, defined as causing the death of

15

another person while driving intoxicated?

16

a crime that creates a serious potential risk of

17

physical injury to another?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You are assuming, of

2

course, that the canon of ejusdem generis applies to the

3

statute, as opposed to Congress just singling out a

4

couple of things it wanted to be sure were covered.

5

we left that issue open in James, didn't we?

6

MS. KATZE:

Yes, you did.

In James you were

7

dealing with a clearly analogous case, and DWI is not

8

analogous in any way, shape, or form with those four

9

enumerated crimes.

10
11

And

And I think that it's pretty

clear JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, in one way -- in

12

one way it is, in that like those other crimes it

13

presents a serious risk of potential injury to another.

14

That's what they all have in common.

15

one argument that was made was when the statute was

16

first drafted all it had was the residual, "presents a

17

serious risk of potential injury to another."

18

that's, the argument is, that's what drives this

19

statute, and then these, these specific crimes, were

20

added just to be sure they would be covered.

21

MS. KATZE:

It's a residual -

So

Your Honor, answering your

22

question and the Chief Justice's question, I think it's

23

important to remember that the first version of this

24

statute came out in 1984, and that just involved

25

burglary and robbery.

And then in 1986, we have the
8


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

version that we have now.

2

What we are discussing is the debate in

3

Congress that occurred between then and how the actual

4

wording was made up.

5

wanted to use those four enumerated crimes merely as an

6

example, they would have structured the paragraph

7

differently.

8

under definition of violent felony and they didn't.

9

But I submit that if Congress

They would have made a third paragraph

There are two paragraphs.

The second

10

paragraph, the one that we're dealing with, clearly

11

there's a substantive connection between the four

12

enumerated crimes and it says, "or otherwise crimes that

13

present a serious potential risk of injury."

14

It seems clear to me if we look at this

15

under the rules of statutory interpretation -- and this

16

is a statutory interpretation case -- that Congress

17

added those four crimes as a means of limiting the

residual clause.

that you have to somehow look to the degree of injury,

crimes have.

It's violent in the sense that

extortion is trying to get something from somebody of

of violent act or more closely related action.

But I think we have to look at the ordinary
case.

I believe even in the hypothetical that you have

act of violence against an individual's reputation, that

That's not what the

But the statute does talk about

If we look at the JUSTICE SOUTER:

It doesn't talk about

23

violence in the abstract.

It talks about physical force

MS. KATZE:

And in the

whole -- it all comes under the rubric of violent

5

crimes.

6

the serious drug offenses, the reason those were added

to the statute is the concern about violence with drugs.

violence will occur.

And the person, likewise, who commits DWI

doesn't want to hurt anybody, but he has placed himself

in a situation in which, if somebody shows up driving

wouldn't be able to make that interpretation, which is

basically what the government is suggesting, which would

read "otherwise" out of the statute and therefore either

MS. KATZE:

I think it's important not to

I wouldn't argue with you that there are more

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But there is

Ms. Kruger, what I don't

understand about this statute as you're interpreting it

10

is why you need any of it except the last phrase?

11

you give the last phrase, "involves conduct that

presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to

another," all of the rest of it is automatically

included.

17

risk of physical injury to another.

18

arson, extortion, the use of explosives?

19

the rest of the statute and simply saying any conduct

that presents a serious potential risk of physical

22

injury or not.

23

Once

That can't be what they meant.

MS. KRUGER:

Well, what this Court said

24

about the structure of the statute in Taylor is that

25

Congress's purpose was first to identify crimes that do
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have as an element the use force, but also to capture a

2

category of crimes that do not have as an element the

3

use force but nevertheless present a potential harm to

4

another human being.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why would Congress

6

go through that trouble, unless they wanted to suggest

7

what other kind of crimes they need to include by this

8

residual category of "any conduct" that presents a

9

serious potential risk of physical injury?

10

MS. KRUGER:

Well, indeed as the Court said

11

in Taylor and I think as the Court reiterated in James,

12

it included the examples of four enumerated offenses in

13

clause 2 to provide examples of the kinds of crimes that

14

they believed to present a serious -

degree of risk, for example?

17

MS. KRUGER:

Yes.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So if it doesn't come up to

19

the degree of risk that any of those four would, it

20

would not be included?

21

MS. KRUGER:

Well, I don't know that the -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MS. KRUGER:

-- that the enumerated crimes

24

set an absolute four.

Congress could have written a

serious risk.

11

MS. KRUGER:

risks that are associated with any other crime.

9

degree of risk.

I mean,

I mean what are the odds that we're

10

going to -- that if there's a burglary, some physical

11

injury might result as opposed to an episode of drunk

12

driving.

13

MS. KRUGER:

Well, Your Honor -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, I

15

guess -- do we really look at how -- what percentage of

16

drunk drivers are involved in accidents as opposed to

17

what percentage of burglars are involved in violent

18

confrontations?

19

MS. KRUGER:

No, Your Honor.

I don't think

20

that the answer to the question can turn on statistical

21

comparisons of the likelihood that harm will result in

22

any given episode of any of these crimes.

23

that is a proposition that the Court underscored in

24

James, when it decided whether attempted burglary

25

qualified without reference to hard statistics.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

I think that

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

fact of the matter is that hard statistics in most of

these crimes are simply unavailable.

answer in any case turn on the availability of

results.

14

it going to make the dangerous -- the drunk driver more

15

or less dangerous if he happens to have a gun in the

16

glove compartment?

17

MS. KRUGER:

Congress

But there doesn't

I mean how -- how is

Well, we think that it's clear

18

from the enumeration of the offenses in clause 2 in the

19

definition of "violent felony" that Congress wasn't

20

intending to capture only a set of crimes that are made

21

more dangerous when they're committed with a firearm.

22

It is, in fact, the kind of statute that Congress wrote

23

in 18 U.S.C. 942(c), which concerns the use or carrying

24

of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of

25

violence.

But here what Congress was concerned about
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was capturing a set of offenders who, by their criminal

2

history, have demonstrated an inherent disregard for the

3

value of human life and therefore should not only be

4

prohibited from possessing firearms but should face

5

particularly severe sanctions for failure to abide by

6

that prohibition.

7

Our -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then they could have turned

8

it just on dangerousness.

I'm back to Justice Scalia

9

and Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm simply sort of

10

repeating those in a sense that make it quite specific.

11

Imagine a universe of crimes.

12

universe we concede has precisely the same degree of

13

danger as arson, explosives, burglary.

So there's no

14

argument about the risk to human life.

It is identical.

15

And now we write a statute, and the statute's object is

16

to take people who are felons in possession of a gun and

17

those persons whom it is particularly bad that they have

18

a gun are going to go away for 15 years minimum.

19

what we're looking are people who are particularly bad

20

that they have a gun.

21

in that universe we have some things on the one hand

22

like arson, but on the other hand -- I have to name a

23

few, environmental crimes committed by negligence or

24

recklessness, where somebody flushed a toxic substance

15

MS. KRUGER:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

16

the initial response to that question is that the

statute that Congress wrote unequivocally focuses the

18

inquiry on the risk of harm to other human beings.

MS. KRUGER:

They obviously meant to tie that to the preceding
And when you tie it to the preceding

Well, I think you don't, Your

7

Honor, because I think the most obvious way to tie it to

8

the preceding sections is, again, to import a kind of

use-of-force requirement such as the 18 U.S.C. 16(b)

10

requirements that would look at the risk of force

11

intentionally will be used in the course of committing

12

the offense, and -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How much of a

limitation is the point Justice Breyer was making?

present a serious risk in a serial manner was indeed

Can you tell me what test,

2

argument?

Drunk driving is within the last clause

It is because, first of all,

the risks of drunk driving are commonly understood.

driving drunk isn't made any more dangerous whether or

MS. KRUGER:

Well, I think one way to start

13

to answer that question is by looking specifically at

14

what Congress likely meant when it referred to "arson"

15

in the statute.

16

defined as maliciously damaging property by means of

17

fire or explosives.

18

that language is not to require intent to damage

19

property in all instances.

21

likelihood that damage will occur; in other words, in

22

situations in which the fire has occurred and recklessly

23

poses harm.

25

fundamentally the same kind of risk that DUI poses.

reach of the Federal arson statute came to encompass use

20

of fire in 1982, only shortly before the ACCA was

21

enacted.

22

legislatures have also defined arson offenses to include

similar kinds of intentional setting of fire with

reckless disregard to the likelihood of damage or injury

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could you comment on one

other point that Judge McConnell made in his opinion?

Is there significance in the title of this statute,

4

"Armed Career Criminal Act."

5

to identify career criminals?

6

MS. KRUGER:

Does this statute intend

Well, I think it's difficult to

7

see how it would support a limitation to the kinds of

8

crimes that are normally committed as a means of

9

livelihood in that sense of "career."

It certainly does

10

refer to career criminals in the sense that they are

11

habitual offenders, that they are recidivists.

12

certainly not all the enumerated offenses, nor even the

13

offenses that are encompassed by the definition that's

14

contained in clause 1 of the statute, are normally

15

committed as a means of violent -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

Well, I'm not so sure.

It

17

seems to me that the burglary, arson, extortion,

career criminal that you see in movies and hear about in

organized crimes testimony and so forth.

don't think it's completely far of the mark.

not committed for insurance fraud, but is committed for

a large number of other purposes that have nothing to do

with the profit motive, including covering up evidence

of other crimes, including simple vandalism.

So I think it's implausible to think that

that are normally committed for profit.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MS. KRUGER:

You rejected my speeder,

What else would fit

We think the category of crimes

22

of recklessness that pose an injury, reckless disregard

23

of the risk of injury to others, would qualify because

24

in those cases juries have necessarily found that there

25

was objectively a serious risk and that failures to
41

appreciate that risk and to act accordingly constitutes

2

a gross deviation from the ordinary standard of care

3

that a reasonable person would exercise.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

specifically.

I'd like to know

You said reckless driving; and what else?

MS. KRUGER:

Reckless driving that results

7

in serious bodily injury or death to another, which is a

8

felony under the laws of many States, would qualify.

9
10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That has the potential of

doing that, not MS. KRUGER:

Yes, but reckless driving

We think, similarly, reckless

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wouldn't that come in

in the first, the violent crime, the first part?
MS. KRUGER:

Well, presumably it wouldn't,

18

because by definition a reckless homicide does not

19

involve the intentional use of force, the threatened use

20

of force, or attempted use of force.

21

relates solely to the killing of another, whether or not

22

by intentional use of force, in situations that

23

disregard the great dangerousness to human life and

24

those actions.

25

And the definition

The other things that would qualify would be
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases like DUI, where recklessness need not be proved as

2

such, but that are underscored by legislative

3

determinations that the conduct that is proscribed is by

4

definition reckless, by definition poses a serious risk

5

that a person should appreciate and should accordingly

6

conform their conduct to a different standard.

7

Petitioner's argument suffers from the

8

fundamental flaw that it describes a statute that

9

Congress didn't write.

Congress did indeed consider

10

incorporating the definition of "crime of violence" that

11

is set forth at 18 U.S.C. 16 when it redrafted the

12

statute in 1986 and it decided against it, instead

13

making the inquiry turn on the potential for risk to

14

human life as opposed to the potential that -- the risk

15

that force would be used or on the intentional use of

16

force.

17

We think that that decision is one that

18

needs to be given effect in interpreting the statute.

19

As this Court recognized in Leocal, the risk of

20

intentional use of force is simply not the same thing

21

that a risk of -- the risk that an accident will occur

22

that will cause serious injury to another.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask about something

24

in your brief on page 37?

You said:

25

on this language because it had two other proposals, one

that it considered too narrow and one that it considered

2

3

considered potentially too broad is "any felony that by

4

its nature involves a substantial risk that physical

5

force against a person or property of another may be

6

used in the course of committing an offense is the" -

7

this is on page 37 of your brief.

MS. KRUGER:

And the one that it

Yes, Your Honor.

That is the

definition of "crime of violence" that's contained at 18

10

U.S.C. 16.

11

than the definition of "violent felony" at

12

924(e)(2)(D)(ii) in at least two respects.

13

it would cover misdemeanors involving use of force as

14

well as felonies.

15

crimes that involve a risk that force would be used

16

against property, rather than focusing exclusively on

17

the risk of harm to a human being, as the definition of

18

"violent felony" in the ACCA does.

19

And it is, indeed, unquestionably broader

One is that

And the second is that it would cover

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It would, in the case of

drunk driving - though, it seems this would be a better

21

case for the Petitioner if we were operating under this

23

MS. KRUGER:

Well, indeed, I think that that

24

is the thrust of the court's decision -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's narrower in that

44
Alderson Reporting Company

sense as applied to this case.

MS. KRUGER:

That's correct.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

May I ask you this

question?

5

first case, Rodriguez, should we remand in this case,

6

because -- because then he -- the fourth felony would

7

have been improperly found if we rule against the

8

government in Rodriguez?

9

If the government were not to prevail in the

MS. KRUGER:

Well, if the Court decided to

10

reach that issue in this case, even though the issue was

11

not pressed or passed on in the court of appeals and

12

wasn't raised in the cert petition, we do think the

13

Court's analysis of the issue in that case applies

14

equally to its analysis of the issue of whether or not

15

the felony prong of the definition of "violent felony"

16

is applicable in this case.

17

So were the Court to decide that the

18

applicable maximum term of imprisonment that applies to

19

a recidivist is the term of imprisonment that would

20

apply to a hypothetical first-time offender, then that

21

decision would control in this case as well.

22

Court should dispose of this case accordingly.

23

And the

But it bears noting that that would not

24

dispose of this question entirely, because there are, of

25

course, other reasons why States treat drunk driving
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

offenses as felony offenses, particularly in situations

2

in which they result in serious bodily harm or death to

3

another, as Your Honor previously noted.

4

The issue in this case comes down to the

5

interpretation of the statute that Congress wrote, not a

6

hypothetical statute that Congress could have written.

7

And that statute identifies one criterion for

8

determining whether or not a felony offense qualifies as

9

a violent felony under the ACCA, and that is its

10

potential for harming other human beings.

11

Drunk driving is commonly understood to

12

present a serious potential risks of injury.

The

13

potential risks of injury are the only reason why it's a

14

crime under the laws of 50 States.

15

associated with drunk driving are comparable in both

16

kind and degree to the risks associated with arson and

17

explosives use, two crimes that Congress specifically

18

identified in the statute as satisfying its definition.

19

For that reason, we think that the court of
