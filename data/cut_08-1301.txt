CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear

argument first this morning in Case 08-1301, Carr v.

5

United States.

Mr. Rothfeld.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
When Congress uses ordinary words in the

12

statute, those words should get their ordinary meaning.

13

In SORNA, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification

14

Act, Congress did use ordinary words, and it used them

15

in an ordinary way.

16

those words be given a most extraordinary reading.

17

suggests that Congress wrote one of the elements of

18

SORNA's criminal offense in a sort of shorthand, and it

19

should be taken to mean something quite different than

20

what Congress actually said.

21

But the government proposes that

JUSTICE ALITO:

It

It proposes -Mr. Rothfeld, I wondered if

22

I could ask you about three interrelated points

23

concerning your textual argument.

24

25

would appreciate it.

And if I could just

1

The first is that it appears that there is a

2

pretty universally accepted modern legislative drafting

3

convention that statutes should be phrased in the

4

present tense.

5

says:

6

provision addresses only the past, the future, or a

7

sequence of events that requires use of a different

8

tense.

The Senate drafting manual, for example,

Always use the present tense unless the

And the House manual is to the same effect.

9

The second is that when the section that's

10

involved here, 2250, was drafted, the drafters didn't

11

know whether SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex offense

12

convictions.

13

And so when they were drafting this, they had -- it was

14

natural, perhaps, for them not to make a special

15

provision for the possibility that there might be some

16

pre-SORNA conduct involved.

17

determined that only post-SORNA convictions would qualify,

18

then only -- then the only travel that would qualify would

19

be -- would be post-SORNA travel.

20

Attorney General decided that pre-SORNA convictions

21

could qualify that the question that's presented here

22

became a possibility.

23

That was left up to the Attorney General.

If the Attorney General had

It was only when the

And the third is that once the Attorney

24

General decided that SORNA would apply to pre-SORNA sex

25

offense convictions, that necessarily meant that conduct

1

constituting a -- a SORNA -- constituting a qualifying

2

sex offense could occur in the past.

3

at least four provisions of SORNA that refer to the

4

conduct that constitutes a sex offense and uses only the

5

present tense, although in those instances it seems that

6

those provisions have to be read as also covering past

7

conduct, pre-SORNA conduct.

And yet there are

8

These are all in 42 U.S.C. 16911, which is

9

reproduced -- the relevant provisions are on 3a to 3-6

10

of the government's brief.

11

them to provide a flavor for this.

12

16911(3)(C), on 3a of the government's brief, an offense may

13

qualify as a tier II offense if, among other things, it,

14

quote, "occurs after the offender becomes a tier I sex

15

offender."

16

read as applying to past conduct.

17

I’ll just mention a couple of
Under 42 U.S.C. section

But there "occurs" and "becomes" have to be

42 U.S.C. 1691(4) on the same page says that

18

an offense may qualify as a tier III offense if, among

19

other things, it involves a kidnapping of a minor.

20

"involves" there has to mean also “involved.”

21

But

And the other two are subsection (7) on 5a
and subsection (8) on 6a.
So I wondered if you could comment on that.
Maybe you have a reaction to it.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I’ll try to keep
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

straight each of the parts of the question.

2

reactions.

3

A couple of

First of all, I think that the ordinary

4

assumption is that when the present tense is used in a

5

statute that's creating a criminal offense, it refers to

6

conduct that takes place after the statute was enacted.

7

We are not aware of and the government has not cited any

8

decision of this Court in which it has interpreted a

9

present tense verb used in a criminal statute as

10

attaching criminal consequences to conduct that took

11

place before the Act -- before the statute was enacted.

12

But before delving too deeply into the

13

present tense question, I think it's helpful to take a

14

look at how that fits into the other elements of the SORNA

15

criminal offense, because there are a number of things

16

about the statutory language that we think compel the

17

conclusion that Congress had in mind only the attachment

18

of criminal consequences to travel that took place after

19

SORNA was enacted.

20

For example, and to begin with, the first

21

element of the offense, which provides that the

22

defendant is required to register under SORNA, the

23

government says, and we agree, that the elements of the

24

SORNA offense have to be read sequentially so that the

25

defendant is guilty only if he or she commits them in
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

order.

2

The first element, as I said, the

3

statutory text, is “is required to register” under SORNA.

4

And it seems undeniable that a defendant is not and

5

cannot possibly be required to register under SORNA

6

until SORNA is enacted and is on the books.

7

enough to dispose of this case because, as the

8

government agrees, the elements are sequential.

9

first element is that there is a requirement to register

10
11

And that is

The

under SORNA.
The second element, the travel in interstate

12

commerce, has to follow the first element.

13

therefore, must follow the enactment of SORNA.

14

think is sufficient to dispose of this case.

15

government's answer to that point is to say -- really,

16

to candidly acknowledge that the statutory language has

17

to be rewritten if they're to prevail.

18

Congress said "is required" --

Congress specifically authorized in SORNA that the

25

Attorney General had the authority to designate

pre-SORNA offenses as triggering the registration

requirement.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that -- that's

4

pretty unusual, isn't it, to have Congress say it's up

5

to the Attorney General whether their laws apply

6

prospectively or retroactively or --

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

It -- it certainly is unusual.

8

I think it's not for us to comment on whether that was a

9

sensible thing for them to do.

But we don't dispute

10

here that -- that Congress did it and that the Attorney

11

General was authorized to do what he did.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But --

Well, it's not as though he

13

was authorized to make something a crime which wasn't --

14

which wasn’t a crime.

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's absolutely right,

Justice Scalia, and I think -JUSTICE SCALIA:

He was authorized to say

you have to register.
MR. ROTHFELD:

It's -- it's actually quite

20

helpful to our argument in this case that Congress was

21

aware of how to confer retroactive authority on the

22

Attorney General for some things, which it did, the

23

designation of pre-SORNA sex offenses as triggering

24

the registration requirement.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought that the sequence
8

argument that the government was making was that the

2

events have to occur in this sequence:

3

the interstate travel, and the failure to register.

4

MR. ROTHFELD:

the conviction,

That is their argument.

But

5

the way that they reach that conclusion is to say that

6

the first element of the offense, which is “is required

7

to register” under SORNA, was really a shorthand by

8

which Congress meant “committed a sex offense” that

9

Congress --

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they might be wrong

11

on that.

12

interstate travel has to take effect -- has to occur

13

after the sex offense conviction.

14

you couldn't violate -- you wouldn't violate SORNA if

15

there’s interstate travel, then the conviction, and

16

then the failure to register.

17

And I understood that you agreed that the

MR. ROTHFELD:

It wouldn't --

We -- we agree, but I

18

think -- we do not agree, obviously, with the

19

government's understanding of the first element of the

20

offense.

21

It's that the SORNA registration requirement attached.

22

It's not that the sex offense took place.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you’re saying it has

23

to take place not just after the offense, but after the

24

obligation to register.

25

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's absolutely right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which is what the statute

says.

MR. ROTHFELD:

Which is what the statute

says.

And, again, the government's only attempt to

5

answer that point is to say that Congress actual meant

6

something different when it wrote the first element of

7

the offense.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, but they might be

wrong that the sequence -- that the way these set out --

10

are set out in the statute dictates a temporal

11

sequence --

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

They --- that you can argue that

14

the temporal sequence that's necessary -- conviction,

15

travel, failure to register -- follows from the purpose

16

of this provision, which is to catch people who, after

17

having committing a sex offense and being convicted of a

18

sex offense in State A, move to State B.

19

follow from the purpose of the statute, not necessarily

20

from the sequence of subsections in this provision.
MR. ROTHFELD:

21

It would

Well, we of course don't

22

agree with the government on everything, but we do agree

23

that they are right about the sequence, for a number of

24

reasons.

25

most natural reading of the statutory language that one

One is that it follows -- I think it's the

knowingly fails to register.

3

put the interstate travel element second, which is

somewhat a peculiar thing to do otherwise.

It explains why Congress

the problem of what we we've been calling the "Lincoln

MR. ROTHFELD:

I guess

You would have to make it up,

11

but if one were to depart from the text of the statute,

12

which says "is required to register under SORNA."

necessarily, the travel took place after SORNA was

enacted.

of the case.

17

broader purposes.

18

of SORNA and what Congress had in mind, the interstate

19

travel requirement and attaching that the travel took

20

place after SORNA was enacted is what Congress wanted

21

to do.

22

SORNA because it was concerned that there was divergent

23

approach to registrations that were taken by -- by States,

24

that they had inconsistent applications of registration

25

programs.

There’s no reason to look beyond that to
But if one does look to the purpose

It accomplishes the purpose.

Congress wrote

This was creating loopholes that allowed sex
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offenders who were unregistered not to register, and the

2

congressional response to that was to create a uniform

3

universal system of registration that it hoped all the

4

States would enact that would facilitate exchange of

5

information between the States and with the Federal

6

Government.

7

And the purpose of the SORNA criminal

8

provision in that context is that it was designed to

9

discourage people from traveling, unregistered sex

10

offenders from traveling, after SORNA was enacted to

11

evade the new SORNA registration requirements.

That's case A.

We

two situations differently?
MR. ROTHFELD:

23

I think Congress had in

24

mind -- as I say, it was addressing a particular

25

problem.

It was concerned that people were evading
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

registration requirements because the States had

2

different diverging systems, and it was allowing some

3

people in some States simply not to register, not

4

because necessarily they were evading State registration

5

requirements, because the State didn't require them

6

to register.

7

what offenses triggered registration requirements.

8
9

States had very different systems as to

And so the congressional reaction was to
say:

We want the States to enact these new, much more

10

comprehensive and intrusive and elaborate registration

11

requirements.

12

intrusive that the States are refusing to do it.

13

but that was the congressional goal, that the States

14

would enact these -- these regulatory regimes; people

15

would then register under them.

16

to have to be registered, or they would be in violation of

17

some State law, State registration requirement.

said, to someone who never traveled in interstate

the States.

2

Clearly, Congress did not intend that it was

3

going to federalize the entire regime of prosecuting

4

people.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what is the basic

6

purpose of this statute?

I'm having a hard time with

7

it.

8

get a lot of people to register who haven't registered

9

at all?

Is it -- is the purpose of the statute to try to

Or is the purpose of the statute to get the

10

people who had registered in one State and then moved,

11

and make sure they register in another State?

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that the purpose was

13

generally to encourage registration of sex offenders.

14

Now, of course, when -- when Congress wrote the statute,

15

as -- as has been pointed out, it was not apparent to

16

them that it was going to apply to people who had

17

committed sex offenses before SORNA was enacted at all.

18

That turned upon the Attorney General's subsequent

19

determination.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I mean, if they are just

21

trying to get people to register in general, and they

22

are not particularly worried about travel, then they are

23

using this travel as a kind of jurisdictional hook.

24

if they are using it as a jurisdictional hook, they’d

25

like to get everybody, as many as possible.

MR. ROTHFELD:

I -- I have a hard

Well, it -- it's -- to -- to

6

be honest, I think it's not entirely clear that Congress

7

had anything specific in mind beyond a reaction to the

8

prior regime in which there were inconsistent approaches

9

being taken by the States.

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14
15

Basically, at the time they

At the time they --- most States didn't

require registration.
MR. ROTHFELD:

All States did require

16

registration of some sort or another, but they had

17

different registration systems and different

18

requirements in their registration systems.

19

were -- there were inconsistencies in them.

20

There

The one thing which appears from the

21

legislative background of SORNA is that Congress was

22

concerned about loopholes in various State registration

23

regimes, and it wanted to have a much more

24

comprehensive, universal, uniform system of

25

registration.

So to address your point
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

specifically about the jurisdictional hook, I think

2

there are two reactions to that.

3

One is, even if it were a jurisdictional

4

hook, it is an element of the offense.

5

that.

6

interstate travel, as we read it, after SORNA was

7

enacted.

8
9

No one denies

It has to be interpreted as written.

It says

So I think that answers the -- the question.
But -- but it -- but it was, I would add,

more than a jurisdictional hook, because Congress had in

10

mind this particular problem of -- of people who,

11

post-SORNA, were going to be evading these new, more

12

comprehensive requirements by simply disappearing.

13

that they were complying with State regimes which --

14

which didn't require them to register, but they would

15

simply cross State lines to vanish.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Not

That begs the question.

17

They were concerned with people who had disappeared, but

18

why is it logical for them to be worried about people

19

who disappear prospectively as opposed to the people who

20

have already disappeared and have failed to -- that's

21

basically the -- the government's argument, which is:

22

One of the main purposes of the statute is to capture

23

those people who have disappeared.

24
25

MR. ROTHFELD:

And so why limit it?

Well, that's -- that's right.

The government's argument is -- is an appeal to what it
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sees as the gestalt of SORNA, rather than the statutory

2

language.

3

But I -- I -- but I think the answer to

4

your -- your question specifically, Justice Sotomayor,

5

is that they were -- they -- that when Congress passed

6

the statute, it -- it had in mind this division of

7

responsibility in -- in criminal enforcement.

8

it expected that the States, in order to comply

9

with SORNA, were going to enact these new and much

It --

10

more -- more punitive criminal regimes to punish people

11

who did not register.

12

concerned, people who never traveled in interstate

13

commerce and people who traveled in interstate commerce

14

before SORNA was enacted are identically situated.

15

And so far as SORNA was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem is that the

16

people who had traveled previously and failed to

17

register would no longer be subject to any -- either any

18

registration process or presumably any punishment

19

either, because they were no longer in the State in

20

which the conviction occurred, so any change in that

21

statute wouldn't affect them.

22

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, that -- under the --

23

the new regime that Congress anticipated would -- would

24

be put in place, every State would enact, would have in

25

place a -- a criminal punishment.

And these were --

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these States don't punish people simply who committed a

2

sex offense in that State and failed to register.

3

require registration of sex offenders who committed sex

4

offenses anywhere.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They

And do -- do they

6

generally require registration even if the offense was

7

committed before the registration act was passed in the

8

State?

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

Yes, they do.

So -- and in

10

that sense mirroring the current interpretation of SORNA

11

by the Attorney General.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So what you’re saying is

13

that, even under your interpretation, there is going to

14

be registration in at least one State?

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Absolutely.
Would you say this at the

17

moment -- you may not know, but I think it would be

18

helpful.

19

almost all States had some kind of registration act?

At the time this was passed, would you say

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. ROTHFELD:

Most, all

Universally.
-- they did not distinguish

based on the location of where the sex offense took
place.

So --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So -- so,

12

therefore, every person who has committed a sex offense,

13

or almost everyone, would have been subject to a

14

requirement to move when he committed the offense and

15

would have been subject to a requirement to register

16

when he moved under some law.

17

then must have been just to try to get uniformity here.

2

who were not required to register in the State in which

3

they -- they lived because that State's law did not

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And would that be the case

6

after SORNA, that some States would have less extensive

coverage than others?

8

MR. ROTHFELD:

It is possible after SORNA

that -- that States will enact criminal regimes that

don't -- that don't mirror the SORNA -- the SORNA

11

definition, but --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, unless that could be

13

the case, then I don't see what is achieved by -- why

14

you worry about somebody moving to another State in

order to evade the registration.

16

MR. ROTHFELD:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, SORNA -I mean, if the new State

18

requires you to register just as much as the old one,

19

what are you worried about?

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, under the SORNA regime

21

if the States all implemented SORNA as Congress

22

anticipated that they would, if they all enacted these

23

statutes, I think that there wouldn't be -- the only

24

concern would be that people would simply fail to

register, they would then disappear -22

That's right.

And I think that is what SORNA is directed at.

4

directed at people -- they are now all subject to

5

registration requirements.

6

concern that people simply won't register.

7

it's designed after SORNA goes into effect, and there are

8

these new requirements on the books.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

SORNA is

SORNA is directed at the
And -- and

The people --

Isn't the concern that the

10

State of conviction knows that an individual who has

11

been convicted of a sex offense has been released from

12

custody and, if that person is a resident of the State,

13

presumably knows that the person is likely to still be

14

in the State, but if the person moves to another State,

15

the State to which the person moves doesn't know that a

16

sex offender has moved into the State, and that's the

17

reason for the Federal law that imposes a penalty for

18

failing to register in the new State after having

19

traveled across interstate lines?

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's -- that's -- that's

21

quite right.

22

saying, first of all, the States all have to -- have to

23

pool their information and exchange them.

24
25

And SORNA addresses these problems by

2

the State and Federal authorities.

3

SORNA itself is designed to be a comprehensive response

4

to this problem, encouraging State cooperation.

5

that is why if we are looking at the policy and -- and

6

just not paying attention to the language for the

7

moment, the focus was on post-SORNA activity, because

Congress has put in place this new regime which is

15

People who are taking steps after SORNA goes

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I think that I

16

remain a little bit confused by the question one of my

17

colleagues answered, and I'm not sure if this last

18

answer by you is helping me understand it, which is if

19

SORNA now -- if every State is supposed to pass

20

legislation which requires sex offenders who have been

21

convicted elsewhere and moved to their State to

22

register, why do you -- I think that's what you -- that

23

you answered affirmatively for Justice Kennedy, correct?

24

SORNA requires every State to pass laws that obligate

25

people who have been convicted in other States to
24
Alderson Reporting Company

1

register, correct?

2

MR. ROTHFELD:

That -- that's right.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So why do you

4

need SORNA?

Why can't those States that the individual

5

has moved to simply prosecute the person for a failure to

6

register?

Why do you need SORNA?

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

Those States could do that.

8

And I -- as to why we need SORNA, why Congress thought

9

that SORNA was a good idea, I -- I think there are a

10

couple of reasons.

One is that there are Federal

11

offenders and Congress, I think, believed that it was a

12

special Federal responsibility to -- to make sure that

13

Federal sex offenders were registered.

14

Congress regarded the problem of -- of unregistered sex

15

offenders as a Federal problem, and it was one that,

16

after SORNA was enacted and this new systematic regime

17

was put in place, was more appropriate for Federal

18

prosecution.

And in addition,

But I think --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Perhaps Congress --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you think part of it

21

is there was a -- SORNA requires a lot more information

22

than was required under the State statutes?

23

MR. ROTHFELD:

Yes.

SORNA is much more

24

expansive both in -- in the type of information that's

25

required and in the mechanism, in requiring in-person

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's conceivable also that

Congress was -- was not confident that the States would

4

be as active in prosecuting violations as the Federal

5

Government would be.

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

That -- that is -- that's

7

possible, too, and again that is a prospective focus.

8

And, of course, I -- my final point is that discussion of

9

the purpose I think illuminates this to some extent, but

10

the language itself is absolutely clear.

11

reason to go beyond the plain text of the statute.

Mr. Gannon.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

21

Petitioner's offense under 18 U.S.C. 2250(a)

22

occurred when he failed to register as required by SORNA

23

well after SORNA was enacted.

24

elucidated, he does not dispute that the first paragraph

25

of SORNA can be triggered by a pre-SORNA conviction, and

As Justice Ginsburg

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adopting his construction of paragraph (2)(B) would

2

create a serious structural anomaly between the Federal

3

offenders, with whom there is no requirement that they

4

engage in any post-SORNA conduct other than the failure

5

to register, and the State sex offenders, who are the

6

majority of the missing sex offenders that Congress

7

intended to capture by enacting the new registration

8

regime and ensuring that there would be a serious

9

Federal penalty that would encourage offenders who had

10

used interstate travel to evade their registration

11

requirements to get back on the registration rolls.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. -- Mr. Carr, was

13

in violation of the law the instant it was passed,

14

right?

15

MR. GANNON:

We don't think he was in

16

violation of the law the instant it was passed for

17

purposes of the Ex Post Facto Clause; under cases like

18

Tranbarger and Samuels, we think that he did have a

19

reasonable period of time to comply with the new

20

obligation.

21

sorts of Federal criminal statutes based on a status

22

that somebody was in at the time something was made

23

criminal.

24
25

This is a problem that would occur with all

In the -- in the case prohibiting possession
of handguns by persons who had been convicted of
27
Alderson Reporting Company

1

misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, that this Court

2

upheld that statute last year, when that statute came

3

into effect, if somebody had the relevant conviction on

4

the books and possessed a handgun, they would have been

5

guilty at the instant the statute came into effect, but

6

they would have been allowed a reasonable period to come

7

into compliance.

8

used in Tranbarger and in Samuels; somebody who acquired

9

alcohol legally before a statutory prohibition provision

That's the reasoning that the Court

10

came into effect would be given a reasonable period of time

11

to divest himself of possession.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

question.

14

reasonable time is?

What's -- an obvious

What’s the government's view on what a

statute, where somebody is typically allowed only 3

19

business days to update their registration, we think it

20

would be a fairly short period.

21

that -- that may depend on all sorts of circumstances.

22

If Petitioner -- or if a defendant, a sex offender, was

23

in the hospital for a long period of time and unable to

24

make it to the registry, that would provide him with an

25

-- an affirmative defense under the text of 2250(b).

In -- in the context of this

It's something that --

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- but the

3

reasonable time question doesn't come up in your --

4

in your hypothetical.

5

MR. GANNON:

In -- in --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

First because

7

he's in the hospital and he has got a defense there,

8

so --

9

MR. GANNON:

Well, that -- that's right,

10

and -- but I -- but we do think that it is a background

11

principle in -- in all of these cases that if somebody

12

is literally unable to avoid the criminal consequences

13

of their pre-enactment conduct, that that would raise the

14

concerns that the Ex Post Facto Clause is intended to

15

solve.

16

And in cases like -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

as a reasonable time goes, nobody's literally incapable

18

of doing it the same day the law passed.

The only thing they have to do --

that interstate travel needs to occur after the statute

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

has come into substantial compliance.

Since -- since the press

32
Alderson Reporting Company

But what's

important here is that that's just a question of whether

2

the State is in substantial compliance with SORNA's

3

requirements for purposes of receiving Federal funding

4

under -- under the Byrne program.

5

And here even if a State has not come into

6

substantial compliance -- and Indiana has not yet been

7

certified as having come into substantial compliance --

8

it still had a functioning sex offender registry that

9

would take most of the information that SORNA required

10

Petitioner to provide, things like his name, his

11

physical characteristics --

12
13
14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that would be what

their -MR. GANNON: -- his -- his address -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- what their old law was.

16

It wouldn't be -- you have -- SORNA is in effect, but what

17

the State is implementing is the pre-SORNA State law, right?

18

MR. GANNON:

It's true that, especially

19

before SORNA was enacted, that that's all the State was

20

doing, if the State has amended its law since then, and

21

Indiana did update its law in 2006.

22

But to the extent -- so the State may well

23

accept Congress's invitation to restructure its

24

registration system to match what SORNA requires, but

25

even when a State has not yet done that, there's no

doubt that someone like Petitioner can go in and

register.

information that Indiana was willing to take.

And so --

What -- what do you

7

do with Mr. Rothfeld's hypothetical about someone who

8

travels in interstate commerce as a young child and,

9

20 years later, is covered by SORNA?

10

MR. GANNON:

Well, we think that that's not

11

covered under the sequencing argument that we’ve made,

12

which -- which partakes of the purpose of the statute

13

that Justice Alito was talking about and -- and the

14

order in which the relevant acts occur.

15

As long as somebody is already a convicted

16

sex offender of the kind that SORNA requires to

17

register, and they are within the time period within

18

which SORNA would require them to register -- and

19

Petitioner here is a tier II sex offender, so he would

20

be required to register for 15 years after his 2004 sex

21

offense conviction.

22

when he engages in the travel, then we think that it’s

23

within the heartland of what Congress was concerned

24

about, which is a sex offender who is engaging in

25

interstate travel --

As long as he is within that period

to the child traveling and then 20 years later is --

MR. GANNON:

The answer

Is --- is because it's

-- you have to require under SORNA before the travel?

7

MR. GANNON:

It's -- no, it's -- you have to

have been convicted of a sex offense, because that --

3

MR. GANNON:

Where do you get that

Well, we get that from the

4

facts -- from the context here, from the anomaly that

5

would be created, the structural anomaly about the

6

differential treatment between Federal and State sex

7

offenders.

8

to recapture missing sex offenders, which are persons

who engaged in interstate travel to elude the

interstate commerce, in order to give that element

persons who already have the type of sex offense

16

convictions that SORNA requires them to register for.

17

And so we think that when Congress

the purpose.

22

That's right.

And we know that the plain language of

23

the statute can't completely control this inquiry,

24

because the Congress changed the language that existed

25

earlier in the drafting process of the -36

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what about going back

2

to the purpose?

3

report where they go in some length to saying that the

4

purpose is this is going to help with 100,000 missing

5

people.

Don't worry; if you can't remember, it doesn't

6

matter.

What they say is there are 100,000 missing.

7

What they do is they travel, let's say, from Alabama to

8

California and they don't register.

9

is going to help with that.

10

There's a section on page 26 of the House

Now, this statute

Well, how does it help with that?

They are

11

already supposed to register in California.

12

thought, well, maybe the way it helps with that is that

13

it imposes some new information requirements, so that

14

Alabama, if it were complying, would now have a lot of

15

information about the sex offender, and it would have an

16

obligation -- it could more easily track him down, or at

17

least California could or somebody could more easily

18

track him down, because he has to give information to

19

Alabama, and Alabama has a registry up.

And I

20

Is there something like that in this?

21

MR. GANNON:

22

but that's not all that’s going on.

23

House report --

Well, there is something like that,

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. GANNON:

On page 26 of the

-- that you’re talking about,
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Justice Breyer, it specifically says that sex offenders

2

who fail to comply will face felony criminal

prosecution.

5

And this -- this was a way --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but that’s -- that’s

true of everybody whether they have moved or not moved.

6

MR. GANNON:

Well, it's --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is, what I’m --

8

the reason I brought up the other is because if this

9

is just a jurisdictional hook, I can see why Congress

10

might be trying to get as many people as they want

11

to register.

12

But this -- this also serves some purpose,

13

like we’re going to make Alabama get some information,

14

makes it easier to catch these people, that purpose

15

wouldn't be served when the travel takes place before

16

this takes effect because Alabama wouldn't have kept the

17

information then.

18

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that Congress did

19

pass the statute for -- for multiple reasons in -- in

20

order to encourage there to be a more effective,

21

comprehensive nationwide registration scheme.

22

of the things that that required was -- anticipated, was

23

standardization among the States.

13

offense convictions.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The only reason I bring it

15

up is if this is a very close case.

16

somewhat against you; namely, that the thing applies

17

full-force in terms of its purposes to people who travel

after, but it only applies as sort of this weak thing to

19

people who travel before.

20

MR. GANNON:

That tends to cut

Well, I think, to the extent

21

that the committee report identified 100,000 missing sex

22

offenders as the most significant enforcement problem in

23

the sex offender context, 10 years after every single

24

State and the Federal government had passed a panoply of

25

sex offender registration requirements, shows that they

were concerned about persons who had fallen off the

2

sex offender registry rolls.

3

if it is -- if it is read to treat Federal and State sex

4

offenders more consistently, which is to require them

5

both -- to subject them both to potential Federal

6

prosecution if they knowingly fail to register after

7

SORNA comes into effect --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that this provision,

No, but -- but it doesn't,

because if you haven't been -- if you are convicted of a

Federal offense, you are automatically in, but if you

11

are convicted of a State offense, you’re in only if you

Is it the case that you found any other

jurisdictional hook in the present tense?
MR. GANNON:

I think that lots of

12

jurisdictional hooks referring to travel and interstate

13

commerce are phrased in present tense.

14

there are a handful that -- that are -- are specifically

15

tailored and have extra language, like the one we cite

dealing with gambling devices that have been transported

in interstate commerce after the effective date of that

that they are phrased in present tense and --

I mean, looking up travels

8

9

found it's always -- it looks like it's -- it's linked

10

directly to the activity that's meant to be covered,

11

you know, traveling for the purpose of the -- the

12

activity that's against the law.

13

MR. GANNON:

That's -- that's true.

In

14

most instances in which Congress has an interstate

travel element, that's true.

that's -- that's -- that's an invocation of --

tense when they mean it.

25

MR. GANNON:

They use the past

In those cases in context,

I think it was easiest to say that when it has
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

traveled vis-à-vis the act that was in question there.

2

And -- and here -- neither side is contending that --

3

that the travel can happen after the failure to register

4

and somebody immediately then becomes guilty of the

5

offense.

6

We think that the sequencing requirement

7

makes sense on both ends, that somebody needs to have

8

the sex offense conviction before they travel, and then

9

they need to fail to register after they have -- they

10

have engaged in the travel, because that's the concern

11

that Congress was trying to get at, persons who were

12

able to use the fact of interstate travel to evade

13

registration.

14

And the reason, Mr. Chief Justice, why I

15

think that Congress didn't include a purpose requirement

16

there is because Congress didn't want sex offenders to

17

be able to take advantage of the fact that they had

18

another good reason to travel.

19

me from one State to another, and then I take advantage

20

of that situation to go underground and not re-register,

21

that’s one of the 100,000 missing sex offenders that

22

Congress was concerned about, even though I would have

23

had a good defense to the charge that I had traveled with

24

the purpose or for the purpose of evading sex offender

25

registration requirements.

If my employer transfers

44

1

Justice Sotomayor, I think you were asking a

2

question about -- about why the -- what the purpose

3

would be served here if States would already have the

4

underlying offense that would be made criminal by SORNA.

5

I think that there are a couple different answers to

6

that.

7

Mr. Rothfeld acknowledged that Congress may

8

well have intended there to be extra force that would

9

come from the -- from the Federal prosecution itself.

10

But separately I think it's important to note that --

11

that States were given time to comply with SORNA, to

12

come into substantial compliance with SORNA.

13

even though no State at this point has said that they

14

don't intend to come into compliance with SORNA,

15

Congress couldn't necessarily have expected States to

16

adopt the particular offense that they -- that

17

they were concerned about.

18

that here Congress did want to -- to cover that

19

situation.

20

And -- and

And I think that -- that --

One other factual point that’s associated

21

with the -- the effectiveness there that was brought up

22

in the briefs and hasn't come up today is the question

23

of -- of when the prior Wetterling Act offenses were

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. GANNON:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

Absolutely --

And -- and --- but they don't have a

SORNA place to register.

6

MR. GANNON:

Well, it's the same place.

7

What SORNA requires is that you provide the following

8

types of information to the relevant officials that run

9

the sex offender registry for the jurisdiction.

10

“jurisdiction” is defined to include the State.

11

And

And, so, in -- in -- in these cases, even if

12

the State hasn't changed the name on the door to SORNA

13

registration facility -- it's just sex offender

14

registration facility under, you know, Zachary's Law,

15

which is the name of the Indiana sex offender registration

16

law, as opposed to Megan's Law -- there is -- they are

17

still required by SORNA to register, which requires them

18

to give information to the relevant officials in the

19

relevant jurisdiction.

20

And the jurisdiction is there; the officials

21

are there.

22

the officials will take the information, the failure to

23

do that is a violation of 2250.

24
25

They are taking the information.

As long as

And there’s one -- one other point that
Petitioner was making in the reply brief was that there
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

seemed to be some confusion about -- about whether there

2

was an offense under SORNA when States had not yet come

3

into compliance or whether that would have been an

4

offense only under the pre-SORNA Wetterling Act.

5

And -- and the reason that there isn't a

6

SORNA violation there, if -- if a State has not yet

7

decided to accept things like digital palm prints or

8

whatever the extra information is that SORNA would

9

require, the -- the defendant is still required to

10

provide that, what information the State will accept.

11

And the affirmative defense in 2250(b) would only be

12

applicable in circumstances where the State wouldn't

13

take that extra information.

14

So it's only those aspects of SORNA that are

15

above and beyond what the State will allow the offender

16

to do, that he's excused from complying with by the

17

affirmative defense, that it's uncontrollable circumstances

18

that he -- that he can't provide a DNA sample or a palm

19

print in a particular State that doesn't do that yet.

20

But as long as the State is taking the rest of the

21

information, he needs to give that.

22

And this is a case where Petitioner utterly

23

failed to give any of the information to Indiana once he

24

arrived there at the end of 2004 or beginning of 2005.

25

So, there's -- there's no dispute that the State would
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have taken that information had he been in compliance

2

with that law.

3

probably wouldn't have been in violation of SORNA at

4

that point.

5

Once SORNA later came into effect, he

But -- but that -- there's nothing unusual

6

about the fact that he could have engaged in pre-enactment

7

conduct that would have prevented him from being in

8

violation, just as the person convicted of a misdemeanor

9

possession -- misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, if

10

he doesn't possess a gun before the -- the new provision

11

in 922 comes into effect, then he hasn't committed the

12

offense.

13

the statutory prohibition comes into effect that was at

14

issue in Samuels before that law came into effect, then

15

he hadn't committed the offense.

If somebody doesn't acquire the alcohol before

16

So, there’s nothing unusual about saying

17

that he could have complied with SORNA effectively in

18

anticipation of its being enacted, even though it

19

didn't yet exist.

20

The -- the -- the question here is whether

21

he knowingly failed to register as required by SORNA

22

after it came into effect.

23

that -- that he did, because he had already engaged in

24

the interstate travel after he had been convicted of a

25

sex offense.
