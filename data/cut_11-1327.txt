ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. MORAN


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8
9

MR. MORAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

A long and unbroken line of this Court's

10
11

precedents stand for the principle that a judge's final

12

determination that a defendant is not guilty is a final

13

determination of an acquittal for -- for double jeopardy

14

purposes, even if that determination is wrong as a

15

matter of law or as a matter of fact.

And even if --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

how the judge labels what the acquittal is?

18

MR. MORAN:

No.

No.

Do we give credence to

This Court must

19

determine -- whatever its label, what has the judge

20

done.

21

government has failed to prove its case, as in Martin

22

Linen, or has the government -- has the judge made a

23

determination of something else, as in Scott, for

24

example, pretrial delay.

25

Has the judge made a determination that the

Now, the Michigan Supreme Court -3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But once -- once the judge

2

determines, quite erroneously, that it has to be a

3

dwelling -- midway during the trial, I'm the judge, I

4

consider this has to be a dwelling, is there any way I

5

can make that point, make that ruling, without invoking

6

double jeopardy?

7

MR. MORAN:

Well, you could reserve that

8

ruling to the end of the case.

You could make a ruling

9

as to the jury instructions without -- or what the jury

10

instructions are going to be without applying them to

11

the facts of the case; in other words, without making a

12

determination of the defendant's guilt or innocence.

13
14
15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but if I persist in

that view, there's nothing the government can do?
MR. MORAN:

The government can try -- we

16

learned from Smith -- try to get you to reconsider that

17

view before the defendant puts on his case.

18

the defendant -- once the judge has made a final

19

determination that the defendant is not guilty, even on

20

an erroneous view of the law, this Court has held

21

multiple times that that is a final determination --

22

that is an acquittal, for double jeopardy purposes.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But once

Because, I suppose, the

judge is the government, too.
MR. MORAN:

Exactly.

Once -- once the

government --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So whether the unfairness

3

adheres in the prosecution or in the judge, the guy's

4

been treated unfairly.

5

MR. MORAN:

If a state chooses,

6

Justice Scalia, to vest acquittal power in its judges,

7

it must accept the double jeopardy consequences of that.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even when the defendant

interjected this issue and the defendant urged the judge

10

to make this incorrect notion that you have to negate

11

the higher crime, in order to convict of the lesser

12

crime, it was the defendant that led the -- the trial

13

judge into error.

14

this on his own.

The trial judge didn't come up with

MR. MORAN:

15

The judge came up with this,

16

Your Honor, on defendant's motion, that's correct.

17

it was actually supported by the jury instructions that

18

were in use.

structure of the statute in question.

21

And actually, it was supported by the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The statute in

But you're not arguing

that that was the correct charge that -MR. MORAN:

No.

We're precluded now from

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

arguing that that's correct.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you don't --

Counsel often encourage

4

judges to do the wrong thing.

5

there is one of the two counsel urging the court to do

6

the wrong thing; right?

7

MR. MORAN:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10

In fact, in every case,

Yes, Justice Scalia.

And --

That's what the adversary

system consists of.
MR. MORAN:

Yes.

And in Sanabria, this

11

Court noted that point exactly, that all acquittals,

12

whether they're by the judge or by the jury -- or I

13

should say almost all acquittals, some are sua sponte --

14

almost all acquittals, whether by judge or by jury, are

15

upon invitation of defense counsel.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- could a state

17

provide a procedure where, if a judge makes a critical

18

ruling mid-trial, that at the request of the opposing

19

counsel, jury proceedings are suspended for 48 hours,

20

and the aggrieved party can run to the court of appeals

21

to get a mandate?

22

MR. MORAN:

I don't think the state could do

23

that, Justice Kennedy, because of Smalis.

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

MR. MORAN:

Because of?

Because of Smalis.
6


Alderson Reporting Company

So that was

Official

1

essentially the situation in Smalis.

You had a bench


2

trial.

He says the


3

evidence is insufficient.

4

attempted to run to the Pennsylvania appellate court.


5

And this Court said it couldn't do that because that was

6

a final determination.

7

The judge grants a demurrer.

And then the prosecution


I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, in my hypothetical,

8

the state said -- and this isn't a final determination;

9

the ruling doesn't become final until you have 48 hours

10
11

and go to the court of appeals.
MR. MORAN:

Well, I think a state could

12

make -- could -- investing acquittal power in judges

13

could put limitations on that acquittal power.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How would they do that?

15

I'd like to go back to Justice Kennedy's question.

16

easy when you have a jury because what happens is a

17

judge can decide whether, at the end of the

18

prosecution's case, he's going to dismiss for

19

insufficiency, or he can give it to the jury, and if the

20

jury renders a verdict, set it aside.

21

It's

Jeopardy attaches only if the judge

22

dismisses the case after the prosecution's judgment, but

23

not if he sets aside the verdict, correct?

24
25

MR. MORAN:

Well, jeopardy attaches both

ways, but a retry -- a reversal is possible in the -- in
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the latter.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. MORAN:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In the latter.

Yes.
So what can a state

5

do -- some have done something -- to ensure that, even

6

if jeopardy has attached, that there can be a valid

7

reversal; if the judge is wrong on a legal theory.

8

MR. MORAN:

Well, the easy --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So give us an example of

10

what, in a judge trial, a state could do to ensure that

11

a legally wrong judgment is still reversible.

12

MR. MORAN:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

In a bench trial, Your Honor?
In a bench trial.

What

could it do?
MR. MORAN:

15

I think if -- if in a bench

16

trial, if the judge has the power to acquit or convict

17

and the judge acquits, I believe the Double Jeopardy

18

Clause would preclude the state from coming up with a

19

clever mechanism allowing -- for allowing appellate

20

review.

21

could, of course --

22

The Court, of course -- I mean, the state

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought there were, in

23

your briefs, some examples -- in someone's brief, there

24

were some examples --

trial.

No, forget about a jury

Let's go to the bench trial.

3

MR. MORAN:

I don't know what --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're not helping your

5

argument by saying there's nothing a state could ever

6

do.

7

MR. MORAN:

Well, they could withdraw the

8

power of judges to grant acquittals or convictions in

9

the first place.

In other words, they could abolish

10

bench trials, which, as the Court noted --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you know something,

12

Counselor?

You're sinking your hole deeper.

13

helping yourself in this argument because how does that

14

help the system?
MR. MORAN:

15

You're not

Well, with all respect, Your

16

Honor, the Double Jeopardy Clause here transcends the

17

state's --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't disagree.

You

19

mean no state could ever say to a judge, given --

20

given -- render a verdict on the prosecution's theory,

21

and then set it aside?

22

legally --

23

MR. MORAN:

If you think the theory is not

After Smith, it's clear that

24

immediate reconsideration is a possibility.

25

state set up a system, as in Lydon v. Municipal Court,
9

Alderson Reporting Company

And if a

Official

1

where you have essentially a magistrate making a

2

preliminary determination, and then it goes to a higher

3

judge who goes trial de novo, that, of course, is

4

permissible.

5

But if the judge is the final arbiter -- in

6

other words, if the judge sits in the place of the jury,

7

this Court has said, over and over again, that a judge

8

verdict is equivalent to a jury verdict, for purposes of

9

Double Jeopardy.
So, yes, courts -- a state could set up

10
11

systems, in which judges have less power than a jury

12

does.

13

am aware of what Nevada has done, which has said that

14

judges can't grant mid-trial directed verdicts.

15

that's the way in a jury trial.

I'm not aware of any state that's done that.

16
17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
"mid-trial."
MR. MORAN:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
mid-trial?

Yes.
What -- what is not

Some states require a judge to wait.

21

MR. MORAN:

And

You keep saying,

18

20

I

Yes.

Yes.

Nevada.

Well, what happens in

those states?
MR. MORAN:

Well, in that case, then there

is no problem because, if the judge makes a
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

determination after the jury verdict, then the -- then

2

that can be appealed under Wilson.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I keep talking, not

4

about jury verdicts, but about bench trials.

5

focus on the bench trial process.

6

MR. MORAN:

I want to

If -- but if the judge at the

7

end of a trial renders a solemn, formal, final verdict,

8

"I find the defendant not guilty," in a bench trial, I

9

don't see a mechanism for -- for the state to appeal

10

that determination, consistent with the Double Jeopardy

11

guarantee, unless the state has set up a system as in

12

Lydon -- as Massachusetts did in Lydon.

13

that, a judge's determination is entitled to the same

14

respect.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But short of

If, in the middle of a

16

trial, a judge grants a mistrial and says -- I'm sorry,

17

grants an acquittal and says, I think that prompt

18

prosecution is an element of the offense, and there

19

wasn't prompt prosecution here.

20

re-prosecution in that situation?

21

MR. MORAN:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

Now, could there be a

Yes, Your Honor.
Even though the judge says

he thinks that that's an element of the offense?

24

MR. MORAN:

Because no part of my argument

25

depends upon the judge's labeling.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

What the judge has

1

done in that case is -- is a mid-trial dismissal that he

2

called an acquittal, but it was actually a dismissal for

3

another purpose.

about.

5

characterized what he had done as acquitting the


6

defendant, but he --

That's exactly what Scott was talking

And that is like Scott, where the judge may have

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, he saw a phantom


8

element, and -- and that's what happened here, too,


9

isn't it?

MR. MORAN:

10

Well, pretrial delay is not an

11

element of the offense.

12

of criminal procedure in this state.

13

Pretrial delay is another part

JUSTICE ALITO:

And this -- and the fact

14

that this was not a dwelling wasn't an element of the

15

offense, either.

MR. MORAN:

But it is clearly related to the

17

offense.

18

meant.

19

between cases in which the judge makes a ruling relating

20

to guilt or innocence and a ruling designed to serve

21

some other purpose.

And then Scott clarified what Martin Linen

In which case, all you've done is

They're simply semantics.

And these

It's all labeling.

There is no -- there is no substance there.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, there -- that's a

12

problem.

13

question, your -- what is your answer?

14

that, if the judge grants an acquittal based on the

15

failure to prove anything that the judge thinks the

16

prosecution has to prove, that's an acquittal.

17

fair?

18

But you're -- to come back to my earlier

MR. MORAN:

Yes.

Your answer is

Is that

And -- and I fall back to

19

this Court's footnote in Scott, that courts are

20

perfectly capable of distinguishing between rulings

21

relating to guilt and innocence and rulings designed to

22

serve other purposes.

23

who's determined to package a prosecutorial misconduct

24

ruling as an acquittal, I have no doubt that an

25

appellate court would be able to -- to smoke that out.

So if you have a devious judge

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, to come back to the


2

argument we just heard, so suppose the judge grants a


3

mistrial for failure to prove an action within the


4

statute of limitations, even though no statute of


5

limitations defense was raised.

6

that be an acquittal?

7

MR. MORAN:

Would that be -- would

Only -- I think my answer to

8

that would depend on how you rule in the prior case,

9

depending on whether the statute of limitations is -- is

10

something the prosecution has to prove in order to

11

establish guilt.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Assuming, for

13

the sake of argument, that it's not an element -- it's

14

not really an element, but the judge thinks it's an

15

element.

16

MR. MORAN:

Well, if it -- if it's something

17

that could result in an acquittal, if it is -- if the

18

defendant raising the statute of limitations is

19

something that could result in an acquittal -- because I

20

come to Burks, where Burks says an affirmative insanity

21

defense, the prosecution fails to disprove that, that is

22

an acquittal -- when the appellate court concluded that

23

there was failure to disprove the affirmative insanity

24

defense.

25

That shows that that language in Martin

of an easement.

3

Linen getting at.

4

identify those rulings relating to guilt or innocence,

5

which include affirmative defenses or --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You have to look at what was Martin
And Martin Linen is trying to

I'm not sure I understand

7

the rationale for your answer to your own hypothetical.

8

The judge characterizes a prosecutorial -- or a

9

misconduct incident as a grounds for acquittal; it

10

really isn't.

Then you said the court of appeals could

11

straighten that out?

12

MR. MORAN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's Scott.
On what rationale -- so

14

what's the general principle that allows the court of

15

appeals to do this sometimes and not others?

16

MR. MORAN:

If the judge has made a ruling

17

going to the defendant's guilt or innocence and finding

18

that, as in Martin, examining the government's evidence

19

and finding that they have failed to prove the

20

defendant's guilt, final.

21

if the judge has made a ruling that is designed to serve

22

some other purpose, so if the judge, in my hypothetical,

23

were to say --

24
25

There can be no appeal. But

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Oh, I thought -- I thought

it was the judge just subjectively does this, but he
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doesn't say any -- he just characterizes it as an


2

acquittal?


3

MR. MORAN:

That's -- that's a case,


4

actually, quite a bit like some of the cases, and it


5

demonstrates the problem of -- of the Michigan Supreme

6

Court's line.

7

judge said is, this is one of the weakest cases I've

8

ever seen.

9

So example, in Martin Linen, all the

Presumably, if the Respondent were to win,

10

they would be entitled to appeal a determination like

11

that to at least try to convince the appellate court

12

that the reason the case seems so weak to the trial

13

judge was that the trial judge had added an extra

14

element.
Same thing in Smalis, where the judge simply

15
16

said -- he granted a demurrer by looking at the

17

prosecution's case and saying that, I find the evidence

18

insufficient.

19

Pennsylvania tried to argue that the judge had actually

20

heightened the burden for mens rea for third-degree

21

murder.

22

And, in fact, in Smalis, the --

And -- and so -- you know, they would be

23

entitled to make these arguments.

And so then we get

24

into questions of, in granting acquittals, would judges

25

have to explain all of the elements -16

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see the problem, but I am

2

still back to where Justice Kennedy was -- and that is

3

my own failing here.

4

thought, when you grant a dismissal and you dismiss the

5

case in the middle of the trial because the prosecution

6

was brought too late, all you're doing is, in the middle

7

of the trial, granting something you should have granted

8

in the first place before you impaneled the jury.

9

I didn't quite understand.

I

But I thought that, in Fong Foo, Judge

10

Wyzanski had dismissed the case after empanelment

11

because he wrongly thought that the U.S. attorney had

12

been talking to a witness or a juror or something at

13

lunch time and that he had -- and that's an acquittal.

14

And I thought Justice Harlan, for the Court, wrote

15

Double Jeopardy, Jeopardy attached, you can't try him

16

again.

17

that.

18

And I didn't think the Court ever overruled
That -- what -- in where?
MR. MORAN:

Fong -- Fong Foo has not been

19

explicitly overruled, but I think it has been limited by

20

Scott.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

So Scott says that even in

22

judge-wise -- Scott says Fong Foo was wrong, that that

23

-- because the reason that Charlie Wyzanski dismissed it

24

is he has this idea of a -- the AUSA doing something

25

improper at lunch.

And -- and that's -- that's -- now,
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on your theory -- on the theory you just enunciated,

2

there would -- there would -- Double Jeopardy wouldn't

3

protect against the second indictment, right?

4

MR. MORAN:

Well, Justice Breyer, Fong Foo

5

actually listed two reasons why the trial judge granted

6

the directed verdict.

7

The judge apparently thought that the prosecutor had

8

been speaking with a witness.

9

One was prosecutorial misconduct.

JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. MORAN:

10

Yes.

But the second one was the total

11

lack of credibility of the prosecution's witnesses.

12

And -- and when the case came --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. MORAN:

Yes.

Yes.

That's --

When the case came to this

15

Court, the concurring Justice said, the second one is

16

good for Double Jeopardy purposes, but I would make

17

clear that the prosecutorial misconduct rationale is

18

not.

19

That part -- I think that concurring opinion

20

has been effectively adopted in Scott, so that a finding

21

of prosecutorial misconduct on dumping this case

22

mid-trial, yes, the prosecution gets another bite at the

23

apple, assuming that it's done on -- on the defendant's

motion.

And

Your Honor, I come back to the

language in Martin Linen, which talks about what the

purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is, is to protect

22

defendants against continuing government oppression.

23

And that oppression arises from the anxiety of having to

24

go through it again and again.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But isn't it -- isn't it

1

hard to argue with a notion that your client has gotten

2

a windfall here?

3

government oppression and -- and -- you know, that's --

that -- that suggests a real harm on the part of your

5

client.

MR. MORAN:

Well, Your Honor, without the

error, the trial would have -- would have continued.

But I think that argument, respectfully, proves too much

10

because there are lots of these cases in which legal

11

error was made.

12

exactly the same thing about Mr. Rumsey.

13

And so -- in Rumsey, you could say

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, I think that's right.

14

This is -- this is an argument against this whole line

15

of cases, that this whole line of cases essentially has

16

set up a system where the real purposes of the Double

17

Jeopardy Clause do not apply and where defendants walk

18

away with windfalls.

argument against that proposition?

20

MR. MORAN:

And I guess what's your best

Well, once you accept the

21

equivalency of a judicial acquittal to a jury acquittal,

22

you have to accept that both actors are capable of

23

24

are capable of making legal errors, as well as factual

25

errors.

Both actors are human.

Juries are incapable --

They are capable of misunderstanding the

In fact, they are capable of being

Had the judge not granted the directed

4

verdict here, she presumably would have instructed the

5

jury the same way, and the jury would have also

6

acquitted Mr. Evans for the same reason.

7

And so to try and tease out legal and

8

factual errors, especially when -- and often, there are

9

mixed questions of fact or law that are at stake here --

10

I think, is a losing proposition.

11

the Court has decided to draw a firm line, recognizing

12

that an acquittal is special.

13

fundamental thing that can happen.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think it -- I think

An acquittal is the most

Could a system say, if

15

you have Double Jeopardy looming in -- in -- in the

16

case, then arguments like the one that the defendant

17

made and the judge bought have to be made pretrial, and

18

if they are not made pretrial, they are waived.

19

here, the -- the -- the case was ongoing when the

20

defendant made this suggestion, as opposed the system

21

had built into it a requirement that defendants that are

22

going to make this kind of plea do it pretrial.

23

MR. MORAN:

I mean,

Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

24

it would have been right for Mr. Evans to make this

25

argument pretrial because it was only with the
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prosecution's proof that it became clear that what the

2

prosecution was proving was that the building burned

3

was, in fact, a dwelling house and, therefore, seemed to

4

be excluded by the statutory language and especially the

5

commentary to the jury instructions from the definition

6

of the offense.

7

Michigan is an information state.

Michigan

8

does not require an indictment that lists every -- every

9

little bit of the crime and all of the details.

All

10

Michigan requires is a very simple statement of the

11

crime and the statutory citation and, of course, who the

12

defendant is and the date and venue of the alleged

13

crime.

14

And so here, Mr. Evans would have had no way

15

of knowing in advance what the prosecution was going to

16

prove.

17

Lee is an effective indictment.

18

Lee was innocent and that the prosecution couldn't prove

19

the elements of the crime against Mr. Lee.

was just that the indictment failed to allege a specific

building or other real property, or the contents

And the next proceeding section of the chapter is about

burning down dwelling houses.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

My only quibble is you

have no doubt -- the defense attorney had no doubt that

10

he burnt down a house -- that someone burnt down a

11

house, correct?

12

MR. MORAN:

It was -- it was allegedly a

13

vacant house.

And apparently, that's why the

14

prosecution charged it this way.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. MORAN:

Got it.

So they charged it.

They're the

17

ones who made the choice of which statute to apply.

18

They, apparently, thought that they couldn't prove that

19

it was a dwelling house, so they proved the other crime.

20

And the thinking -- the thinking of the defense attorney

21

and the thinking of the judge was that these two crimes

22

were complementary to each other; in other words, that

23

they did not overlap.

24
25

It was either a dwelling house or not a
dwelling house, and then one statute or the other

applies.


2

As a result of the ruling of the Michigan


3

Court of Appeals in this case, which is now not


4

contested, in fact, the burning -- the -- the statute


5

under which Mr. Evans was charged totally encompasses

6

the greater crime because any building is covered in the

7

crime with which Mr. Evans is charged, while only

8

specific buildings, dwelling houses, are charged in the

get the enhancement if they prove it's a house.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY A. BAUGHMAN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6
7

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This trial here was ended before verdict

8

from a jury on the motion of the defendant, opposed

9

vigorously by the prosecution, alleging, essentially,

10

that the crime charged contained an uncharged element on

11

which insufficient proof had been presented for a

12

rational factfinder to find guilt beyond a reasonable

13

doubt; that uncharged element being that the offense be,

14

for want of a better term, of a -- excuse me -- the

15

structure be, for want of a better term, a non-dwelling.

16

We had -- that had not been alleged.

But it

17

has been conceded throughout the appellate history of

18

this case, from the Michigan Court of Appeals on, that

19

there is no such element in -- in the -- in the crime.

20

The statute that Mr. Moran mentioned, that

21

refers to the next preceding section, over three decades

22

ago, was held to be words of limitation; in other words,

23

you don't have to prove it's a dwelling, to prove that

24

other real property -- a building or other real property

25

has been burned.
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So in the 1970s, it was held the difference

2

between the two statutes is the greater requires proof

3

of a dwelling or a habitation; the lesser does not.

4

judge held that you have to prove the negative of the

5

element that enhances the offense, in order to prove the

6

lesser offense; you have to prove it's a non-dwelling.

7

And, again, that's been conceded to be error throughout

8

the entire appellate history here.

9

The

And so the proofs were adequate -- were

10

appropriate here, and the charging document was

11

appropriate here.

12

facts, does termination of the trial by the judge

13

constitute an acquittal, so that jeopardy should bar a

14

second trial?

And the question becomes, on these

15

The Jeopardy Clause is aimed at prohibiting

16

certain governmental abuses that occurred historically.

17

One of them is when the government would terminate a

18

trial that was not going well, without the consent of

19

the defendant, in order to take another shot at it -- to

20

build a better case or perhaps get a better factfinder.

21

And the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits

22

that kind of conduct by establishing, through this

23

Court's cases, that mistrials without the consent of the

24

defendant bar retrial, that abhorrent practice is

25

barred, unless a manifest necessity is shown.
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And we've even extended that to the

2

circumstance that, if the judge is intending to help the

3

defendant, if he is doing something that he believes is

4

in defendant's favor, if defendant has not consented,

5

then that valued right to a verdict from the tribunal

6

that he is before trumps everything.

7

But if there is consent, as there was in

8

this case -- the defendant asked the judge to terminate

9

the trial without going to this jury, so he gave up his

10

valued right to a decision by this tribunal -- if he

11

does that, then that -- the other side of that coin is,

12

that is ordinarily outcome-determinative the other way.

13

A retrial is permissible, unless the

14

government has achieved the first harm by the back door;

15

that is, by goading the defendant into the mistrial.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So if -- if the judge did

17

this on her own, that would have been okay?

18

would be Double Jeopardy attaching?

19

MR. BAUGHMAN:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And there

That's correct.
So we have to decide in

21

each case whether the defendant was the initiating

22

source of the error?

23

MR. BAUGHMAN:

In terms of the -- whether or

24

not a judgment of acquittal was granted, yes, both the

25

Federal rule and the Michigan rule provide that, on the
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defendant's motion or on the court's own motion, the

2

court may grant a directed verdict.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what if the

4

defendant just agrees with the judge?

5

you know, I think this indictment is bad because you --

6

you have to show that it wasn't a dwelling place, and

7

the counsel for the Defendant says, yes, that seems like

8

a good -- a good idea.

9

The judge says --

Is -- is that enough to --

MR. BAUGHMAN:

I think that would be enough.

10

I think agreement with the judge's course of action

11

would be the judge -- would be, as in the mistrial

12

situation, would be the defendant's --

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, my goodness,

disagreement would be malpractice, wouldn't it?

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. BAUGHMAN:

Well, it -- it depends on

whether you really wish to get a verdict from this jury

or whether you risk having a -- risk -- risk wanting to

have a retrial before a different factfinder.

position, but it is -- there's --

14

There is a logic to that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You don't go that far, in

case.

MR. BAUGHMAN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct.
But do you concede that the

19

logic of your position would extend to improperly

20

instructed juries?

MR. BAUGHMAN:

It would, to a certain

extent, but it is -- it is cut off by two facts.

23

simply, as -- as Justice Holmes often said, the -- the

life -- an ounce of -- I'm -- excuse me -- an ounce of

logic is often trumped by a pound of history.
31

Alderson Reporting Company

One is

We have

historically said that a verdict by the factfinder, by

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, we've historically

5

said it in this context, too.

6

you are asking us to overrule go back 50 years.

7

MR. BAUGHMAN:

I mean, the cases that

Well, when I say

8

historically, I mean back to the time of the founding,

9

in terms of when the Double Jeopardy Clause was

10

promulgated and adopted into the Constitution.

11

Fifty years is not back to when we were determining what

12

it is we were protecting against when we adopted the

13

clause.

14

And as I think most of the commentators have

15

noted, there is very little explanation in Fong Foo as

16

to how the Court came out where it came out, and there

17

has been very little explanation since as to how we got

18

from the common law prohibition of a retrial after

19

acquittal on the merits by a jury, to a ruling of law by

20

the judge that no jury could find guilt beyond a

21

reasonable doubt being the same thing, which is where we

22

are today.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

You cannot necessarily -Well, we didn't have it, at

the time of the founding, any mechanism for a judge to
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do that.

I mean, this -- this is a new procedure, and

2

how it fit into the prohibition of Double Jeopardy was

3

certainly a -- an open question.

4

It's not as though this procedure existed at

5

the time of the founding or in English law before then

6

and was never adequate to -- to constitute Double

7

Jeopardy.

8

question for the Court was, well -- you know, if it's

9

the judge rather than the jury that pronounces the

10

It's a new procedure introduced, so the

acquittal, does -- does that constitute Double Jeopardy?

11

Well, I think you are exactly

12

right.

13

exist at the time of the founding.

14

becomes is this new procedure sufficiently equivalent to

15

that procedure that is historically protected, that

16

it's -- that the protections that it is designed to

17

guard against are served when we bar retrial in these

18

circumstances?

19

It, of course, is a new procedure.

It didn't

So our question then

And I think, as Justice Kagan has indicated,

20

there are many circumstances where what -- what we are

21

doing is giving the defendant a windfall while serving

22

no interest that was protected by the Jeopardy Clause.

23

So if it's to be an analog, then we need to see does it

24

really closely approximate a retrial after acquittal on

25

the merits by a jury -33

Alderson Reporting Company

was that the same windfall is received by the defendant

And where I'm driving is that -- that there

designed to protect against of the executive simply

Something has to happen in-between there,

acquittal, as it's known in Michigan, was not that at

Now, is that an incorrect interpretation?

19

one element, and the other is people are currently

20

living there?

21

MR. BAUGHMAN:

I -- I would define -- I

would draw the line at any time the court requires the

prosecution to prove a fact that, under the law passed

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

We believe the Court can resolve this case

by distinguishing between the misconstruction of an

Smalis is probably the hardest case in this

context, but if you look at what actually happened in

Smalis and what was at issue in the demurrer there, the

decision that the Court was reviewing was one that was

25

principally about whether there was sufficient evidence
45

of causation, which was an undisputed element of each of

2

the counts at issue there, and only in footnote 7 of the

3

of the element.

And it was a different element.

Let's go through this.

My

basic question:

Normally, a judge will wait till the

10

whether to set it aside.

11

now, we have the judge -- for some reason or other, this

judge has decided to grant the motion of acquittal in

13

the middle of the case.

14

So there's no problem.

So

Now, this is unusual, I think -- I hope.

15

And if so, though, the judge might not think of writing

16

down his reasons.

17

enough evidence.

18

he did that, the defense lawyer argued to him an

19

erroneous theory.

20

something or other, some kind of misconstruction of

21

this.

So he might just say there isn't
And now, it happens that, just before

What happens then?

22

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that we -- we

normally expect judges to give reasons for their

24

decisions.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

But this a judge,

46

Alderson Reporting Company

after all, who for some reason -- we don't know what --

2

decided, instead of waiting, as they normally would do,

3

grant it in the middle of the case.

4

MR. GANNON:

Well, in the -- in the State of

Michigan, the rule does not permit the judge to reserve

6

the ruling on this motion.

majority of states --

rule in Michigan, and in the Federal Rule 29, does

2

require the judge to make a determination of -- to

satisfy that -- that there's an acquittal, which would

mean that there is no -- no sufficient evidence to -- to

5

support a guilty --

MR. GANNON:

But many states have a

Many -- many states -And many states permit

the judge to reserve it till after the jury verdict.
MR. GANNON:

My -- my understanding is that

12

most states do not permit that.

13

only started permitting that in 1994, and even the last

14

time the Justice Department studied this, about ten

15

years ago, it concluded that, notwithstanding the 1994

16

rule amendment in the Federal rules, which came with

17

advisory committee notes, strongly encouraging judges to

18

reserve these sorts of decisions precisely to preserve

19

the public's interest.

20
21

So notwithstanding --

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

Notwithstanding that, what?

25

So then, in other words,

when an acquittal --

22

24

The Federal government

MR. GANNON:

Finish the sentence.

Notwithstanding that, in

approximately 70 percent of the cases in which there are
48

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Rule 29 verdicts, they are done mid-trial, even in the

2

Federal system, at least in the early 2000s, is the only

3

data collection that I'm aware of.

4

And so this -- this still is a problem.

I

5

think that if -- if it looks like the decision is based

6

on classic insufficiency of the evidence and there is no

7

argument about whether it was -- it's based on a

8

misconstruction or an erroneous addition of the

9

elements, then we -- we would have to be -- we would

10

lose, unless the Court's willing to overturn the broader

11

line of cases in Martin Linens, Sanabria, Scott, and the

12

other cases that were --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you add to that -- your

14

-- just your idea of what the empirical situation is in

15

the last 30 or 40 years?

16

prosecutors in these states thought that they could

17

appeal an acquittal on the -- in the middle of the trial

18

on the ground that the judge made a mistake of law?

19

MR. GANNON:

Have most U.S. prosecutors or

I don't think that they -- they

20

have mostly thought that, but the Federal government

21

certainly has maintained that that -- that that is

22

appropriate.

23

in the Third Circuit in 1984 recognized this.

24
25

In -- we think that in the Maker decision

We do think that there is -- my -- my friend
Mr. Moran asks the Court to conclude that any decision
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

like this, that is predicated upon a supposed erroneous

2

addition of an element, could easily be recharacterized

3

as a misconstruction of another element.

4

And I think that -- that while, at some

5

formal level, that -- that that might be theoretically

6

true, in an egregious case like this, there is a

7

distinction, which is that if -- if this were an element

8

of the offense that needed to be charged in the

9

indictment -- at least in the Federal system, then the

10

failure to have alleged that the structure here was a

11

non-dwelling would have made the indictment invalid.

12

And the Defendant would have been able to

13

make exactly the same legal argument he made to the

14

judge here, which is to say that the prosecution has

15

failed to prove -- has failed even to allege one of the

16

necessary elements of the offense, which is that this

17

structure is not a dwelling.

18

particular --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We know that that

Mr. Gannon, if we -- if

20

we adopt your rule, it -- it can't be for this case

21

only.

22

nonexistent element -- or a court's misconstruction of

23

an element, I think, in many cases, you could do -- call

24

it one or call it the other, so that -- that's a

25

difficult line to -- to adopt.

And I -- I think this characterization,

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. GANNON:

Well, I don't think it's

2

difficult, in the sense that most -- most of the cases

3

that we are talking about don't involve this type of

4

error.

5

Smalis, and Smith, even the Petitioner doesn't

6

characterize this case as involving additional elements.

7

The cases that this Court has decided, Rumsey,

And this Court has recognized, in Lee, that

8

when the error is one that kept the indictment from

9

being valid because it failed to charge a relevant

10

element and the judge did not rule on that until after

11

jeopardy attached, the government was still entitled to

12

appeal that decision, and if it were erroneous -- the

13

government's only going to get a chance at retrial if

14

the judge's decision was legally erroneous, then,

15

therefore, it demonstrates that there was no so-called

16

acquittal on the -- on the offense charged --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, you gave us

18

earlier the statistics of how many judges grant Rule 29

19

motions in trial.

22

MR. GANNON:

The only data that I have seen

23

about this is data that the Justice Department collected

24

approximately 73 pretrial Rule 29 dismissals per year --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MS. GANNON:

Out of what number?

-- which actually is a larger

4

number than you -- than you might at first think,

5

because that represents about ten percent of the number

6

of cases that were actually resolved by jury verdicts.

7

And so it -- it is not uncommon.

8
9

I mean, this particular type of error that
we have in this case, we think, is the most egregious

10

kind, the non-existent element error, which -- which the

11

government had also pointed out in its amicus brief in

12

Smalis, we think is the most egregious kind of error.

13

It's one that demonstrates that the court is engaging

14

in -- it's usurping the province of the legislature in

15

redefining the scope of the offense.

16

And we think, under the terms of the Double

17

Jeopardy Clause itself, which talks about whether

18

there's been -- somebody's been subject to being twice

19

in jeopardy for the same offense -- then it -- it

20

matters what the offense was.

21

And when the judge has redefined the -- the

22

crime so extensively that the indictment literally would

23

have been invalid and could have been dismissed as not

24

adequately alleging the elements of the offense, and we

25

know that that is something that the government would
52

2

have been able to appeal.
We also know that the government would be

3

able to appeal if the judge had reserved decision until

4

after the jury had returned a jury -- a guilty verdict.

5

We acknowledge, as the state does, that jury

6

verdicts are different.

If a jury is misinstructed and

7

a jury returns an acquittal, that we are not quarrelling

8

with that in any way.

9

purchase in the Court's case law to do that.

We don't think there's any
And I

10

think one of the reasons is because the jury verdict

11

might be attributable, not just to mistake or error, but

12

also to lenity or compromise.

There -- there are lots of reasons why we

that an additional element to the aggravating

circumstance, or you can call it as a misconstruction of

construed as a misconstruction of the element that the

property burned has to be a building, and the judge

says, looking at the statute, I construe that to mean a

all the way back to Kepner -- all of this case law?

six years ago in Smith, there is an easy solution if

If there really is a problem with judges

going wild and granting directed verdicts mid-trial for

no apparent reason, all that has to be done is the

19

states can fall into that, as we can say, judges can't

20

do that, or judges as an intermediate -- states as an

21

intermediate step could at least give judges the power

22

to reserve that decision --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Have any states done that?

24

I -- I'm somewhat concerned about telling a judge that,

25

if the judge's best judgment says there's insufficient

MR. MORAN:
Justice Kennedy.

I would be, too,


I think it would be a mistake.


I'm not aware of any state, since this

decision, even after being alerted in Smith, that

14

there's something they can do about it, that the good of

power outweighs the bad.

17

States have apparently made the

Finally, I'd just like to respond to

18

Mr. Baughman's point, and it was also raised by

19

Mr. Gannon, about how jury verdicts are different.

20

There's something special about jury verdicts because we

21

don't always know why they granted the verdict.

22

But we have the same problem with judicial

23

directed verdicts.

And we have Martin Linen, where the

24

judge just says, this is the weakest case I -- I have

25

ever seen.

We have Smalis, where he just says, it's

If the Court adopts the line that the
