 THE COURT: 

We'll hear argument first this 

morning in Case 131034, Mellouli v. Holder.

 Mr. Laramore.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JON LARAMORE 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8
9
10

 MR. LARAMORE: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The initial goal of this appeal was to 

11

reverse a single Board of Immigration Appeals decision 

12

that changed the removability analysis for drug 

13

paraphernalia convictions.  It abandoned the 

14

longstanding practice that Congress had ratified. 

15

 We wanted to reinstate the rule that still 

16

applies in all other drug deportation decisions which 

17

looks at the facts that must be established by a 

18

conviction and at the record of conviction, when that's 

19

appropriate, under this Court's precedents  in Moncrieffe 

20

and Descamps.  That methodology has led to tens of 

21

thousands of drug deportations each year, but not for 

22

someone convicted of possessing a sock. 

23

 Now, the government has argued that this 

24

wrongheaded BIA paraphernalia decision should be 

25

expanded to all drug convictions.  The government wants

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

any drug conviction to be a deportable offense, even if 

2

it's clearly for a nonFederal drug. 

3

 This Court should reject the government's 

4

position and the BIA's position and adhere to the 

5

timetested approach that the statute  to the  to 

6

the statute that Congress has ratified. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

9
10
11

Can I 
Can we begin by looking at 

the text of the statute?  What does the phrase "relating 
to a controlled substance," et cetera, modify? 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

Relating to serves the 

12

function of connecting the very broad range of offenses 

13

that Congress wants to make deportable to the list of 

14

substances that  that the  that Congress has 

15

specified. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let's say we were 

17

let's say we're back in high school and we have to 

18

diagram this sentence. 

19

 MR. LARAMORE: 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
We could start out that way, 

21

and maybe we'll get beyond it, but let's start out that 

22

way.  We have a phrase here, "relating to a controlled 

23

substance."  What does it modify?  It has to modify a 

24

noun.  What noun does it modify? 

25

 MR. LARAMORE: 

"Relating to" would modify 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

would modify "law" or "regulation."  But if you 

2

bought  if you diagram the sentence, everything 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If it modifies "law," then I 

think you've lost the case. 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

But if  if you diagram the 

6

sentence, though, everything in that whole phrase, 

7

"convicted of a violation of a law or regulation 

8

relating to a controlled substance under Section 802," 

9

all modifies "alien."  The whole phrase has to be taken 

10

together and read together to modify what alien is 

11

deportable. 

12

 And  and the pure grammar does  is not 

13

sufficient to determine what Congress meant when it 

14

enacted that text. 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If you  if you  I 

16

think Justice Alito is right.  If you're claiming that, 

17

then you're accepting that there's ambiguity, and you 

18

have an uphill battle to fight. 

19

 MR. LARAMORE: 

Well, again, given the text 

20

and the context of this statute and the history of its 

21

application over decades and decades, um there's 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's an argument that 

they're arbitrary and capricious. 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

Well, it  it's also part of 

the analysis that goes into determining the Chevron, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

question that you allude to, Justice Sotomayor, because 

2

Chevron should be approached after applying the usual 

3

principles of statutory interpretation, and that's 

4

that's what Chevron says. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Wait, wait.  How does it 

6

how does it  I've missed this.  I  I'm missing 

7

something.  Why  why do you lose the case? 

8

 MR. LARAMORE: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well 
I mean, I  I assume 

10

that  I assumed as you said  what  what are you 

11

fighting here?  I assumed, as you said, that  that the 

12

words 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, that was my question. 
 relating to a controlled 

15

substance as defined in Section 102 concern any law or 

16

regulation.  And 

17

 MR. LARAMORE: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19

 MR. LARAMORE: 

20

only part of the analysis. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And that's only 
You deny that? 
Well  and  but that's 

I understand that it's not. 

22

I thought that was not your argument to deny that.  Your 

23

argument was that this  where  where you have a  a 

24

State law or a foreign law or something, and it does 

25

relate to the regulation of a controlled substance, but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1
2

a lot of other things as well, that that falls outside. 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

Yes.  And particularly in a 

3

sentence that  that has such a focus on the word 

4

"convicted." 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

  Suppose it 

6

relates to the State law, there  there are 36 802 

7

substances and here it has  it relates to 37.  That's 

8

case one. 

9

 Case two, it relates to 4,037. 

10

 MR. LARAMORE: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
And both of these statutes 

12

contain the 36 that are in Section 802.  One contains 

13

4,000 more, and one contains one more.  How am I 

14

supposed to analyze those two statutes? 

15

 MR. LARAMORE: 

This goes to the application 

16

of the categorical approach and the modified categorical 

17

approach.  If the identity of the substance is  is an 

18

element of the offense, then you use the modified 

19

categorical approach, you look at the record of 

20

conviction, and you determine what substance is 

21

involved.  And if it's a substance on the 802 list, then 

22

the person is deportable. 

23

 And as the analysis that we've provided in 

24

the appendix to our reply brief shows, many, many, many 

25

State statutes um are divisible in exactly that manner.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  So your  your 

2

argument is, it relates to 4,036, and 36 are 802s.  And 

3

so what we do is we read the statute.  It doesn't tell 

4

us what this conviction is about.  We look to the 

5

documents in the modified categorical.  If it lists one 

6

of the 36, that's the end of it, goodbye, he's 

7

deported. 

8

 MR. LARAMORE: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10

Yes. 
If it doesn't, we don't 

know.  If we don't know, he wins. 

11

 MR. LARAMORE: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes.  That's exactly right. 
Okay. 
Well, that  that might be 

14

sensible, but I  I really do need to start with the 

15

text of the statute and understand what you make of the 

16

text of the statute. 

17

 So if "relating to" modifies "law," do you 

18

deny that the law  that the  the Kansas law in 

19

question here relates to a controlled substance?  Or do 

20

you read relating to a controlled substance to mean 

21

relating solely to controlled substances as defined by 

22

Federal law? 

23

 MR. LARAMORE: 

The Kansas statute in this 

24

instance relates to a Federally controlled substance 

25

sometimes.  It relates to  and that's why 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But the law  the law 

2

relates to what it relates to.  It doesn't relates to. 

3

It doesn't relate to something at one time and something 

4

at another time.  What does the law relate to?  The law 

5

relates to a long list of drugs.  The great majority of 

6

them are on the Federal list.  A few of them are not on 

7

the Federal list.  Now, if it said relating solely to 

8

drugs on the Federal list, you'd have an argument.  I 

9

just need to know what you want us to do with the text 

10
11

of the  of the statute. 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

When it's in the context that 

12

it's in, in  in this sentence, again, with the focus 

13

on convicted, a  a law that  or I'm sorry, a word 

14

that Congress has put  has used in our immigration 

15

statutes for decades with this particular meaning, 

16

convicted is the statutory hook, as the Court said in 

17

Moncrieffe, for the categorical approach.  And it's 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Suppose  suppose the 

19

State's list was identical to the Federal list.  You 

20

still don't know which particular.  We know, but it's 

21

not part of the charge. 

22

 MR. LARAMORE: 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

24
25

Yes. 
So Kansas has an 

identical list. 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

If it's identical or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

narrower, the person is deportable.  And there are many 

2

statutes 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And if it has one that's 

different, not deportable? 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

No.  If  if the  if the 

6

substance is an element and you use the modified 

7

categorical approach, then you can determine what 

8

what substance is at issue and 

9
10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

substance  in this case, we don't. 

11

 MR. LARAMORE: 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

13

 MR. LARAMORE: 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

17
18
19

If you don't 
It's not charged.  So 

it's not an element. 

14

16

Well, we don't know what 

That's 
So it's not  it's the 

difference that 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

It's not in the record of 

conviction. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It  it doesn't seem to 

20

make a whole lot of sense to say deportable if the lists 

21

are identical, but if Kansas has one more on the list 

22

not deportable. 

23

 MR. LARAMORE: 

This Court has  well, this 

24

Court has  has applied the categorical approach in 

25

just that way, as have many of the courts of appeals.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

 It is a  it is a way of determining what 

2

is the  the  what the person was convicted of, 

3

because you look at the facts that are  that must be 

4

found for the conviction, and it's a mode of analysis 

5

that's been used in the immigration laws going back 

6

decades. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, that's lovely, but 

8

it doesn't get you around the question that Justice 

9

Alito asked, what is the law?  May I make a suggestion? 

10

 MR. LARAMORE: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Certainly, Justice Scalia. 
Perhaps the law  if you 

12

ask somebody what law did Mellouli violate here, it 

13

would be perfectly natural to respond by reciting one 

14

the elements of the law that he violated.  He was 

15

convicted of possessing drug paraphernalia to store a 

16

controlled substance. 

17

 And so also with any other violation of a 

18

law that names a number of controlled substances.  If 

19

you ask what law did  did you violate, he would say, I 

20

violated the  the law that made it unlawful to have 

21

marijuana or that it made it unlawful to have cocaine. 

22

 It seems to me you've got to  you  you 

23

have to divide the word "law" and the word "regulation" 

24

up into the component elements of the law or regulation 

25

before you can reach the result that you would like to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

reach. 

2

 MR. LARAMORE: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 (Laughter.) 

5

 MR. LARAMORE: 

Yes.  And that's 
Is that a good suggestion? 

Yes, your Honor.  And  and 

6

in our view that's precisely the work that's done in the 

7

statute by the word "conviction" and its association 

8

with the categorical approach. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

10

 MR. LARAMORE: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Laramore 
That's the framework. 
 that is one way of 

12

looking at it, but might I suggest that you gave in a 

13

little bit too fast to Justice Alito that the phrase 

14

"relating to a controlled substance" has to modify 

15

"law."  It's  it's very true that usually in grammar a 

16

phrase like that would modify the last noun 

17

 MR. LARAMORE: 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
 which in this case is 

19

"law."  There is another noun in this sentence, which is 

20

"violation."  And can I suggest to you that maybe, if 

21

you read this entire provision, it's pretty clearly 

22

talking about violation, because here is the way it 

23

reads.  It's  "convicted of a violation of any law 

24

relating to a controlled substance other than a 

25

marijuana offense."  "Other than a marijuana offense."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

 Now, it just doesn't make any sense to say, 

2

a law relating to a controlled substance other than a 

3

marijuana offense.  What makes sense is to say, a 

4

violation of law 

5

 MR. LARAMORE: 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Violation. 
 other than a marijuana 

7

offense.  So this last phrase, "other than a marijuana 

8

offense," which is an exception and so you say what's it 

9

an exception to?  The offense is an exception to the 

10

violation.  So the violation is the key word doing the 

11

work in this phrase. 

12

 MR. LARAMORE: 

Yes.  And "law" really has to 

13

be in the sentence to support "States, United States, 

14

and  and foreign country."  Other  otherwise, that, 

15

which is an important concept in the law, couldn't be 

16

sensibly  sensibly there. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It certainly is possible for 

18

"relating to" to modify "violation."  It's an awkward 

19

way of phrasing it, but that is possible.  It's a noun. 

20

It could modify that. 

21

 So what would the violation be? 

Is the 

22

the violation then is not  the violation, I take it, 

23

then, would be the alien's conduct, what the alien did. 

24
25

 MR. LARAMORE: 

I think that's right.  I 

think that's right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

2

 MR. LARAMORE: 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is that right? 
I believe so. 
So what then happens if the 

4

alien's conduct relates to a Federally controlled 

5

substance, but the conviction is under a law that does 

6

not relate to a Federally controlled substance?  What if 

7

the alien, for example, is convicted of burglarizing a 

8

house for the purpose of stealing drugs that are in the 

9

house? 

10

 MR. LARAMORE: 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It 
The law doesn't relate to a 

12

controlled substance, but the conduct does relate to a 

13

controlled substance. 

14
15
16

 MR. LARAMORE: 

Right.  And the deportability 

rises and falls on what the person is convicted of. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  It's not the conduct. 

17

I think you misspoke when you said that.  It's  the 

18

violation is the crime of conviction. 

19

 MR. LARAMORE: 

I certainly didn't mean to 

20

say conduct if I did, and I know that conviction is the 

21

key concept here and it always has been the key concept 

22

as we've applied this set of laws to  to our 

23

immigration, to noncitizens. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

A few moments ago, I 

understood you to concede when Justice Ginsburg asked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

the question that if there is an exact parallel between 

2

the State law and the Federal law, your client would be 

3

deportable. 

4

 MR. LARAMORE: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
So the fact that 

6

there's a  it's a drug paraphernalia conviction has 

7

nothing to do with the  the issue before us? 

8
9

 MR. LARAMORE: 

Well, the um  the  the 

drug paraphernalia statute under which he's convicted 

10

requires that the conduct be associated with a 

11

controlled  a Kansas controlled substance.  So if the 

12

Kansas controlled substance list is the same as the 

13

Section 802 list, and then the conviction satisfies the 

14

statute. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So, so long as the 

16

drug offense is related to, then the paraphernalia 

17

offense is related to?  So it doesn't make any 

18

difference that we're dealing with paraphernalia? 

19

 MR. LARAMORE: 

I  I think I understand 

20

your question, and I think that the answer to your 

21

question is yes, because the paraphernalia statute 

22

specifically incorporates the controlled substance 

23

schedule from Kansas. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So you don't get any help 

by what seems to be the case, that this sock would not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

count as drug paraphernalia if we were  if we were 

2

dealing with a Federal prosecution. 

3

 MR. LARAMORE: 

You are absolutely right that 

4

it would not.  Possession of paraphernalia is not a 

5

Federal offense.  One cannot be prosecuted Federally for 

6

possessing drug paraphernalia. 

7
8
9
10
11
12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the question I wanted 

to ask 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

But that 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 is a sock considered 

drug paraphernalia under Federal law? 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

It would not, be because the 

13

Federal statute says that  I don't have the language 

14

in my head, but the concept is that to be paraphernalia 

15

it  its usual purpose has to be to facilitate drug 

16

sales or drug use or one of those things that 

17

paraphernalia does.  And the Kansas definition is far 

18

broader than that.  It's really any object that can be 

19

used to store or facilitate storage of or facilitate use 

20

of a controlled substance. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that's why I 

22

would have thought your answers to me would have been 

23

different because you would want to say that the 

24

paraphernalia is an additional hurdle.  Just because the 

25

drugs relate to the Federal drugs doesn't mean that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

can say the paraphernalia does, because it covers all 

2

sorts of things that the Federal law doesn't. 

3
4

 MR. LARAMORE: 

That's correct.  It does 

it does cover many things that the Federal law doesn't. 

5

 And it would  it would be inappropriate. 

6

It  that shows why this isn't the conduct that 

7

Congress was trying to address when it 

8
9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if the  what if 

someone was convicted of possession of a pipe that is 

10

very well designed to smoke crack, but maybe conceivably 

11

could be used to smoke a little bit of tobacco.  So 

12

it  maybe it's lawfully sold in some places because it 

13

could have a legitimate use.  What would  what would 

14

happen then? 

15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23

 MR. LARAMORE: 

The question is what the 

person is convicted of and 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

He's convicted of possessing 

a crack pipe. 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

If he is convicted of 

possessing 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It's necessary to show 

that  that there was crack in the pipe? 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

Not under the Kansas statute. 

24

The Kansas statute just says that the  that the object 

25

has to have  have been used or is intended to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1
2

used 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, in your view, in order 

3

to make  in order to make this count as a  as a 

4

deportable offense, it would be necessary to show that 

5

there actually was crack in the pipe or that he actually 

6

 MR. LARAMORE: 

Not the way we read the

statute.  But the conviction would have to involve a

controlled substance and would  if it's both tobacco

 MR. LARAMORE:

linchpin.

 MR. LARAMORE:

Yes. 
Well, crack is a Federally 

controlled substance. 

21

 MR. LARAMORE: 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
So I didn't understand the 

23

answer to your question.  Would  would it be  would 

24

the crack pipe itself be enough or do you have to show 

25

actual crack?

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. LARAMORE: 

The crack pipe itself would 

2

be enough, as long as there was proof or a pleading to 

3

its use with, at some point, or its intention to be used 

4

with crack.  That's 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, well, well, wait. 

6

Only  only using the modified approach so that you 

7

would show it was  it was intended to be used with 

8

crack.  But on its face, if the Kansas statute still 

9

covers crack, yes, but a lot of other stuff 

10

 MR. LARAMORE: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MR. LARAMORE: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 that alone would not 

support the conviction, would it? 

13

15

That is correct. 

That is 
You  you'd have to go to 

look to see what he was actually convicted of. 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

Right.  And  and our 

17

analysis, again, as I point to that lengthy appendix, is 

18

that the great majority of State statutes that cover the 

19

primary drug activities  manufacturing, sale, and 

20

possession  are divisible statutes and would be 

21

subject to the modified categorical approach. 

22

 There are also many statutes that fit within 

23

the Federal  within the Federal 802 schedule under the 

24

categorical approach.  There are State statutes that 

25

outlaw marijuana possession, that outlaw narcotic

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

possession, in ways that  that the statute just fits 

2

within the categorical approach.  But  but the 

3

modified categorical approach is what may apply most of 

4

the time and  and it would  it  and really what 

5

we're doing here is, is I'm making this argument about 

6

the modified categorical approach to counter the 

7

government's policy argument, which is that our 

8

perspective would cut back on the number of people who 

9

could be deported for drug violations and  and that's 

10
11

just not so. 
 In fact, the Board of Immigration Appeals 

12

has been applying the law the way we say it should be 

13

applied for  for all nonparaphernalia offenses for 

14

decades, and it always is deporting, if you look at 

15

their own statistics, 30,000, 35,000 people a year for 

16

drug offenses. 

17

 So it's not  the approach that we are 

18

advocating here, that has been used for many years, is 

19

not something that brings a halt to drug deportations. 

20

Drug deportations have been happening all along in 

21

under  under the approach that we suggest. 

22

 The government is really reading the law 

23

here to encompass all drug convictions, and it would be 

24

odd for that  for that argument to be correct, given 

25

that the statute says  makes this reference to Section

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

802, which is only Federally controlled substances. 

2

 You can't really reconcile that with the 

3

Section 802 reference.  The government's position reads 

4

that out of the statute. 

5

 The last  well, Congress has always 

6

well, the categorical approach has applied for decades. 

7

The  the academic history takes it back to 1913, the 

8

first application of the doctrine, and Congress has been 

9

aware of that approach to the law, that approach to 

10

applying the law, has continued to pass statutes that 

11

use the word "convicted," which is what embodies the 

12

categorical approach.  And under the  under the 

13

application of that principle that we are advocating 

14

here, Congress has add  has amended the statute 

15

numerous times since it was put into the form it's in 

16

now, which is 1986, in a way that add  that signifies 

17

its ratification of the approach that we're suggesting. 

18

 Congress has not only been aware of the 

19

categorical approach, but also has, since the outset of 

20

the statute, controlled the list of drugs that are 

21

deportable.  And currently, the way the statute is set 

22

up is 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Nobody's disagreeing with 

24

the categorical approach.  I don't know why you're 

25

wasting your argument on that.  We  we all agree with

the categorical approach.

Well, let me 
The question is categorical 

to what?  That's the issue. 
 MR. LARAMORE: 

Well  and just to 

6

differentiate our  what we're saying from the 

7

government's position, which they also argue, is a 

8

species of the categorical approach, we're talking about 

9

the categorical approach as it has traditionally been 

10

applied, where the elements of  of the conviction have 

11

to be compared to the generic Federal statute or to the 

12

statute of 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

When you say "categorical 

14

approach," you mean the modified categorical approach, 

15

do you not? 

16

             

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In  in a jurisdiction like 

18

Kansas or in any foreign jurisdiction that has a list of 

19

controlled substances that is a little bit broader than 

20

the Federal list, lists at least one or two that are 

21

broader than the Federal list, the pure categorical 

22

approach would never result in  in removal; am I 

23

right? 

24

 MR. LARAMORE: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No 
In a removable offense.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

 MR. LARAMORE: 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's not correct. 
How would it?  You'd say 

3

the person was convicted of selling a drug that is 

4

categorized, that is on a list or part of a list, that 

5

would be the element of the offense. 

6

 MR. LARAMORE: 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But um 
So you would have to look 

8

beyond that to see which particular drug.  That's the 

9

modified approach, is it not? 

10

 MR. LARAMORE: 

Many States, including 

11

Kansas, have some statutes that don't invoke their 

12

entire schedule.  For example, a marijuana possession 

13

statute that stands alone.  That would be  that would 

14

fit under the categorical approach. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's not his 

16

hypothetical.  His hypothetical is a statute that 

17

includes one drug which is not on the Federal list. 

18

 MR. LARAMORE: 

I misunderstood.  Then under 

19

the categorical approach that person would not be 

20

deportable.  As  as we've shown, we think that most of 

21

those statutes would be analyzable under the modified 

22

categorical approach, yes. 

23

 Congress always has retained control over 

24

the substances that can lead to deportability.  Under 

25

the current statute it's opened up the conduct, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

kinds of crimes that are deportable, allowing those to 

2

be crimes defined by the States, defined by the 

3

United States or defined by foreign countries, as long 

4

as they relate to the Federal crimes. 

5

 And that is  that is shown by  these 

6

substances that are on the State schedules that are not 

7

on the Federal schedules could be on the Federal 

8

schedules if the attorney general determined that they 

9

were serious enough drugs, that they were dangerous 

10

enough drugs.  Some of the subjects  of the substances 

11

on the Kansas schedule, TFMPP, which is a hallucinogen, 

12

for example, have been on the Federal schedule, but have 

13

been removed from the Federal schedule. 

14

 So these indicate that they're  they're 

15

substances of the sort that the government has not 

16

thought to be significant enough to even involve in 

17

Federal crimes 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, if we  just 

19

to move you along, if we  do you agree with the 

20

government that if we find the government's distinction 

21

between drug trade offenses like the paraphernalia 

22

statute and drug possession and distribution offenses 

23

unreasonable, do we remand to the board?  And if not, 

24

why not?  And if you want to save it in an answer on 

25

rebuttal, you can.

 MR. LARAMORE: 

Well, I think that the  the

BIA has had its chance to state its position and it has 

3

carved out  this drug trade exception is really a drug 

4

paraphernalia exception.  Nothing fits within drug trade 

5

except for drug paraphernalia.  The things we ordinarily

think of as drug trade, like selling and trafficking, 

7

are not part of the drug trade exception.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER 

15

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

16

 MS. KOVNER: 

17

please the Court: 

18

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 There are two independently sufficient 

19

reasons why Petitioner's drug paraphernalia conviction 

20

permitted his removal. 

21

 The first is that Federal law allows the 

22

removal of an alien convicted of violating a law 

23

relating to controlled substances, and State drug laws 

24

that cover hundreds of Federally controlled substances, 

25

in addition to some additional drugs, are laws that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1
2

relate to Federally controlled substances. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What  what if the 

3

State law covers controlled substances entirely 

4

different from the Federal law?  Maybe they figure the 

5

feds can take care of that list; we're just going to 

6

have a law with these.  Does the State law relate to 

7

controlled substances? 

8

 MS. KOVNER: 

9
10
11

We would say it does not relate 

to "controlled substances as defined in Section 802," 
which is the full statutory phrase. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry, I don't 

12

understand that.  You're doing the flip of Justice 

13

Ginsburg.  You're  so how many drugs on that list have 

14

to relate to 802 drugs for it to relate generally? 

15

 MS. KOVNER: 

It  we would concede, along 

16

the lines of Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that if you 

17

have a State law that controls 6,000 Statecontrolled 

18

substances and one federally controlled 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

How about half and half? 
Wait, what was the 

answer?  If you have it 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 MS. KOVNER: 

That  that law has the kind 

24

of tenuous relationship to federally controlled drugs 

25

that the Court has said is not a relating to 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1
2

relation 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It doesn't say more than 

3

tenuously related to.  It says related to.  Where are 

4

you smuggling in the "tenuously"? 

5

 MS. KOVNER: 

I'm taking it from this Court's 

6

cases.  The Court has said "relating to" is extremely 

7

broad, but the Court has said there is some outer limit 

8

at which even if there's a literal relating to 

9

relationship 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that's how you get 

11

to drug paraphernalia, meaning, as Justice Kagan said, 

12

the drug paraphernalia comes in only because it relates 

13

to drug possession and distribution 

14

 MS. KOVNER: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

That's right. 

substance under 801. 

17

 MS. KOVNER: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19
20

 of a controlled 

We think that 
Or 802, what is it 

whatever it is. 
 MS. KOVNER: 

That's right.  We think that 

21

crimes involving drug paraphernalia are crimes that 

22

relate to controlled substances, and there are two 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You keep leaving out the 

24

802.  There are other sections of the criminal act that 

25

specifically say, any conviction and  and it could be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

of any law, right?  But this one doesn't say it that 

2

way. 

3

 MS. KOVNER: 

We think that, as Your Honor 

4

correctly notes, these are laws that relate to 

5

controlled substances as defined in Section 802.  And 

6

there are two reasons why:  The first is that a statute 

7

that  that relates  a statute that forbids 

8

possession of paraphernalia that's connected to hundreds 

9

of federally controlled drugs, and here nine additional 

10

substances, relates to federally controlled drugs.  And 

11

the second is that 

12
13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And  difficult  now 

answer. 

14

 MS. KOVNER: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
How many of the laws 

16

how many of the controlled substances have to be on the 

17

State list?  Is 50/50 enough, 75/25, 6 out of 

18

 MS. KOVNER: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20
21

We think that 
I mean, what  what's 

the  how many have to be on the list? 
 MS. KOVNER: 

We think that all the State 

22

laws that currently exist are laws that relate to 

23

federally controlled substances.  And all of those 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that's not true of 

foreign laws and this relates to foreign laws.  I mean,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

there are some foreign countries that list many of the 

2

controlled substances the U.S. does but adds alcohol. 

3

Now, some people may think alcohol is a controlled 

4

substance, but it's not on the 802 list. 

5

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, we acknowledge 

6

there might be a case involving a foreign law or 

7

involving if in the future a State decided to take a 

8

very different approach, where you would have a literal 

9

relatingto relationship, but there would be a question 

10

of whether the law was so far beyond what existed at the 

11

time and what Congress could have imagined that it no 

12

longer relates to.  But Petitioner's reading of 

13

"relating to" isn't a permissible reading of the 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But what second 

second 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you, please  do you 

17

think that if we apply a modified categorical approach 

18

and focus in on the conviction here which was for a 

19

sock?  Do you think a sock is more than tenuously 

20

related to  to these Federal drugs? 

21

 MS. KOVNER: 

Yes, Your Honor.  And here's 

22

why:  These drug paraphernalia statutes modified on the 

23

model act, like Kansas's, are quite broad, and we 

24

acknowledge. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right.  That's why I'm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

proposing modified categorical approach.  He was 

2

convicted of having a sock and you think that's more 

3

than tenuously related to these Federal drugs. 

4

 MS. KOVNER: 

We do, because he wasn't 

5

exactly convicted of having a sock.  He was convicted 

6

using an innocent item as a tool for the storage of 

7

drugs, and that's true of every drug paraphernalia 

8

conviction.  Typically drug paraphernalia involves 

9

objects that have an innocent use and objects that have 

10

an illicit use.  But essentially every State has decided 

11

that in order to impede the drug trade and drug use you 

12

need to prohibit those. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What about, you said 

14

second?  You said two reasons.  You got your first out 

15

and I'd like to hear your second. 

16

 MS. KOVNER: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18
19
20

Yes. 
You said the second, didn't 

you? 
 MS. KOVNER: 

There is an additional reason, 

Your Honor. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

She said it. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

She didn't. 

23

 MS. KOVNER: 

The BIA has reasoned  the BIA 

24

has reasoned, in a conclusion that entitled to Chevron 

25

deference, that paraphernalia statutes are statutes that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1
2

attack the drug trade in general. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  Now I got the second 

3

one.  Now I do have one question, and it's right related 

4

to Justice Scalia's, and it seems to me  that 

5

what he said, if I understand it correctly, makes this 

6

not too difficult a case, but you won't like it: 

7

That  that we have long  yes, it modifies law, but 

8

we have long, if we go back to the seminal case, Taylor. 

9

There is a Massachusetts statute.  It forbids a burglary 

10

of a boat, a car, and a house.  So what Justice Blackmun 

11

said  I think it was he who wrote it  go back to the 

12

documents to see whether he was charged with burglary of 

13

a house, a boat, or a car. 

14

 So we have a tradition of looking back to 

15

the charging documents and maybe a couple of others to 

16

see what part of the statute.  Now, this statute is a 

17

statute that first penalizes many, many things, 

18

packaging  packaging is relevant here.  What kind of 

19

packaging?  Packaging of drugs.  Okay.  What drugs?  It 

20

doesn't say drugs.  It says controlled substance, so you 

21

have to crossreference. 

22

 Then we look to crossreference, and it says 

23

controlled substance means a substance included on State 

24

schedule 12345 or part B, so it incorporates that. 

25

 So then we go look to those documents, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

those documents will have a long list.  And we look to 

2

see here which of the documents on the list which is 

3

incorporated into the statute is he charged of 

4

packaging.  Very simple.  Happens it's not that simple 

5

to do, but that is absolutely traditional given our 

6

holdings on how to apply the categorical  modified 

7

categorical system. 

8
9
10

 So why not just do that right here? 

Solves 

every problem that's raised. 
 MS. KOVNER: 

Let me give two responses.  One 

11

is a textual one, and the second, I think, goes to your 

12

practical point because I really think it's important 

13

that it won't actually solve the practical problems 

14

here. 

15

 As to the textual point, when Your Honor 

16

talks about Taylor, I think it's important to note how 

17

different the statute here is, which is unlike many 

18

provisions that talk about being deportable or suffering 

19

some other consequence for being convicted of a crime 

20

relating to something, here it's talking about being 

21

convicted of violating a law relating to something. 

22

 But I really want to address this practical 

23

point, because, Your Honor, we think the result under 

24

Petitioner's view is going to be a real patchwork in 

25

terms of what conduct is removable depending on what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

State you're in.  And the reason why, Justice Breyer, is 

2

that it's not going to be possible to apply the modified 

3

categorical approach to many drug statutes.  It will 

4

sometimes and it won't other times, and let me explain 

5

why. 

6

 For instance, here, under this statute, it 

7

appears and under paraphernalia status generally, there 

8

will typically not be a requirement of a finding or an 

9

admission of what particular drug you intended to use 

10
11

the 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But if I understand the way 

12

the law works, right, Ms. Kovner, that's  that is true 

13

of paraphernalia drugs, that they're indivisible with 

14

respect to the controlled substance.  It's not true with 

15

respect to most possession statutes or distribution 

16

statutes or so forth.  And the reason that there is that 

17

distinction is because paraphernalia offenses are 

18

generally extremely minor offenses; they're not 

19

felonies.  They're just, as in this case, they're 

20

misdemeanors that are meant to catch leftover things 

21

that, you know, prosecutors plead to when they don't 

22

really want to charge a more serious offense. 

23

 And so it makes good sense that all of these 

24

paraphernalia offenses would be counted out by this 

25

approach.  You're counting out a bunch of trivial  I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

mean, you know, "trivial," I don't want to say 

2

trivial  minor offenses. 

3

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, I think two points 

4

about that.  The first is that we don't think it's 

5

correct that this is going to be just paraphernalia 

6

offenses and not any possession or distribution 

7

offenses.  And if you look at the cases that are cited 

8

on page 31 of our brief, they illustrate that, which is 

9

the conviction records are not necessarily specifying 

10

the drug that's involved in a particular offense.  And 

11

so you're going to have a really haphazard system. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, right now even 

13

your brief admits that the BIA is applying a different 

14

standard to possession and distribution offenses.  It's 

15

applying the 802 specification. 

16

 MS. KOVNER: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Your 
And it's trying to draw 

18

a difference.  I don't  I still don't understand how 

19

it does it, but my point is that you're proving it's 

20

you're living by the 802 distinction with distribution 

21

and possession. 

22

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, I'm not sure that 

23

that's true.  We think that the BIA's precedent at this 

24

point in unclear.  The BIA 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yeah, what you're hoping

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

for is that they will change that one, too.  But let's 

2

answer what's happened up until now. 

3

 MS. KOVNER: 

Yes.  As to what's happened up 

4

until now, I don't think that's clear.  My understanding 

5

is that the BIA will generally try to seek removal of 

6

people who have been convicted 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Because they have 

8

discretion.  If they're not automatically removable and 

9

they look at the underlying papers and decide it's a 

10

more serious crime than  than the  than the strict 

11

removability statute, they let the person  they remove 

12

this person anyway. 

13

 MS. KOVNER: 

I don't think that's correct, 

14

Your Honor.  What we're seeking here is the authority to 

15

seek removal for persons who've committed these 

16

offenses.  If  in this case, for instance, if we were 

17

to not prevail, we would lack the authority, the 

18

government would lack the authority to remove Petitioner 

19

no matter how serious it regarded his underlying 

20

conduct. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

A couple of 

22

sentences ago you said that a sock, when it's used in 

23

connection with the drug activity, is sufficiently 

24

related to the Federal Controlled Substances Law.  What 

25

about a gun?  Those are often used in connection with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

drug activity.  So is a law concerning gun possession or 

2

gun control or whatever, a State law that relates to the 

3

Federal Controlled Substances Law? 

4

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, I think this would 

5

be a  a difficult question on either of our sides, 

6

which is to say, for  for both parties there would be 

7

some set of statutes that are related to  that have 

8

some connection to drugs indirectly and there would be a 

9

question of whether those statutes count.  We don't 

10

think that a statute that addresses guns merely because 

11

guns and drugs have some, you know, relationship 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

statute addresses socks, it does. 

14
15
16

 MS. KOVNER: 

Well, yes.  But if a 

Well, here, Your Honor, it's 

not a statute addressing socks.  It's a statute 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It was addressing 

17

socks when used in connection with drug activity.  I'm 

18

talking about guns when used in connection with drug 

19

activity. 

20

 MS. KOVNER: 

Oh.  Your Honor, a statute like 

21

the 924(c) that applies to guns when used in connection 

22

with drug activity, we think would be a law that relates 

23

to controlled substances.  We think statutes that 

24

regulate conduct, that um leads to the proliferation of 

25

drugs or the use of drugs is a poor statute relating to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1
2

the drug trade. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Under your definition 

3

under your understanding of this, what practical work is 

4

done by the phrase as defined in Section 802 of Title 

5

XXI? 

6

 MS. KOVNER: 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Your Honor 
You said a couple of minutes 

8

ago, and I had assumed this to be true, that under the 

9

laws of all the States, the great majority of controlled 

10

substances are on the Federal list, and there  in some 

11

instances  are a few additional ones and you said that 

12

all of those laws would be covered.  If that's the case, 

13

then I don't see what was achieved by putting the 

14

reference to the Federal list in the statute.  They 

15

might have just said relating to a controlled substance. 

16

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, we think that this 

17

parenthetical clarifies that  the meaning of 

18

controlled substance, the thing that it has to relate to 

19

are the substances as defined in Federal law.  There is 

20

another colloquial meaning of controlled substance if 

21

you look in, like, Black's Law Dictionary, which is just 

22

any regulated drug and that would apply to, for 

23

instance, prescription drugs that aren't controlled 

24

under the Controlled Substances Act. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Would it have to be drugs?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

I mean, there are some States that ban pate, for 

2

example, right? 

3

 (Laughter.) 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5
6

You wouldn't want that 

swept into this statute, would you? 
 MS. KOVNER: 

That would not be a statute 

7

under the law of a State relating to a controlled 

8

substance as defined in Section 802, because it wouldn't 

9

be regulated under a State's direct statutes that also 

10
11

include the Section 802 substances. 
 And if I could just explain why we think 

12

that Congress enacted or  a law that applies to any 

13

person who violates a State law relating to controlled 

14

substances.  When Congress enacted the  the provision 

15

of the INA that's currently in effect, it acted against 

16

the backdrop of State laws that were designed to tightly 

17

coordinate with Federal laws and that were designed to 

18

produce the kind of regime that they have, in fact, 

19

produced for any  any overlap between the State and 

20

Federal schedules is the overwhelming proportion of the 

21

drugs that are controlled on State schedules. 

22

 And, Justice Breyer, if the Court were to 

23

hold that those laws aren't laws relating to controlled 

24

substances, whether an alien is removable under those 

25

State laws designed to parallel with Federal laws is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

going to depend on what  what kinds of findings the 

2

State requires to be made in connection with those 

3

possession 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, that's  it wouldn't 

5

make that law a nullity.  Indeed, the person would be 

6

deportable provided when you went through the State 

7

charge, the State charge was you violated the packaging 

8

for use statute, packaging a controlled substance, in 

9

respect to Item 13 under Schedule II, which they could 

10

say, anyway, and that happens to be heroin.  And if, in 

11

fact, when you went through Schedule III, Part 4(a), the 

12

word there was "alcohol," then it wouldn't. 

13

 Now, that's simple. 

And if the State's 

14

charging practice is such that they don't tell you, 

15

that's equivalent to a State charging practice that in 

16

Massachusetts didn't tell you whether you were accused 

17

of burglary of a boat, of a house or of a car.  And if 

18

the State wants to do that, I guess it might be up to 

19

them if you get a guilty plea and then you could not 

20

deport the person. 

21
22
23

 MS. KOVNER: 

But Congress didn't want that 

result, Justice Breyer.  Congress 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I want  a lot of 

24

people  but they can't control the State charging 

25

practices and the States are likely, for reasons of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

information, to put in the charge the whole thing, 

2

including the correct reference on the schedule.  So is 

3

that the only thing you find wrong with it?  And I agree 

4

with you that that is a slight problem, that  that 

5

we'll read back the conviction of four years ago in 

6

Missouri and we will see that it doesn't tell us what 

7

item on the schedule.  That's the problem that you see. 

8

 MS. KOVNER: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10

That 

 MS. KOVNER: 

Any other? 
Your Honor, that's a 

11

significant practical problem that's going to introduce 

12

widespread variation in the deportability of people who 

13

have committed crimes involving Federally controlled 

14

substances. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But  but as Ms.  as 

16

Justice Sotomayor suggested, it's a significant 

17

practical problem that's implicated in the current 

18

practice of the BIA. 

19

 MS. KOVNER: 

I  I'm  I don't think 

20

that's correct.  We think the current BIA precedent is 

21

quite ambiguous on the possession point and we think 

22

that 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It at least might be 

implicated in the current practice of the BIA. 
 MS. KOVNER: 

We think that the BIA's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

precedent on this point is unclear. 

2

 But, Justice Breyer, our argument isn't just 

3

about the practical consequences.  It's also about the 

4

best reading of this text.  We don't think this text 

5

is  is ambiguous.  It talks about violations of laws 

6

relating to 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You have to choose.  As you 

8

well know, the problem you just mentioned is a problem 

9

that we're just having a terrible time with in respect 

10

to the violence addons.  And it's  stems from the 

11

fact that State laws differ one from the other 

12

enormously.  So we either have that problem or we have 

13

the problem of you have a general statute and which does 

14

it apply more to and so forth.  Or you have the problem 

15

of do you look  as I think Justice Kagan's approach 

16

do you  you look at the individual facts of the case 

17

and require them to prove it out again.  I  I don't 

18

see how we escape one serious problem or another. 

19

 MS. KOVNER: 

I agree.  And let me propose 

20

that there are  there's difficulties under either 

21

approach  approach.  Let me tell you why I think this 

22

is the best approach here. 

23

 The first is I think the text signal that 

24

Congress chose our approach here.  And the text is 

25

different from any other similar provisions.  The second

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1
2

is that there's 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It's  it's exactly 

3

like it.  When Congress intended to say  and I can 

4

point to at least three provisions  when it wanted to 

5

say any controlled substance without reference to  to 

6

802, it said, any controlled substance.  And when it 

7

wanted to limit it to 802, it defined the controlled 

8

substance as being listed in 802. 

9
10

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

differentiate the two. 

12

 MS. KOVNER: 

So it knows how to 

The  the textual contrast that 

13

we find most revealing here is that there are provisions 

14

of the INA that talk about being removable for a crime 

15

related to controlled substances, and then you would do 

16

the categorical approach just as you're proposing.  But 

17

let me just mention the practical reason why we think 

18

our approach is preferable, Justice Breyer, and why we 

19

think that Congress chose it, which is that Congress 

20

acted against the backdrop of State drug laws like 

21

Kansas's, which  which weren't States just enacting 

22

random lists of substances as their controlled substances. 

23

These laws are designed, as  as Congress put it, as an 

24

interlocking trellis to closely relate to Federal law. 

25

So Congress wanted 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Ms. Kovner, I would 

2

think that the history works against you in the 

3

following way:  Because the prior statute here was a 

4

statute that listed all these Federally controlled 

5

substances.  And that eventually got to be impractical, 

6

there were too many of them, they kept changing and so 

7

Congress went to this approach.  But it was clear in the 

8

old statute that the only way that you could be held 

9

deportable was if you had been convicted of an offense, 

10

you know, possession or distribution or whatever, with a 

11

Federally controlled substance.  And there's no reason 

12

to think that in enacting this statute that  that 

13

Congress meant to do something broader than that. 

14

There's every reason to think it wanted to do the exact 

15

same thing.  If you're convicted of a controlled 

16

substance  of possession of a controlled substance, 

17

you are deportable.  If you're not, if it's only 

18

Sudafed, you're not. 

19

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, I don't think 

20

that's correct.  Congress, in the prior versions of the 

21

statute, did specify particular acts that your conduct 

22

had to involve and also specified a narrower list of 

23

substances that your conduct had to relate to.  But I 

24

don't think it's clear that Congress believed  there's 

25

nothing in the legislative history or other documents to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

suggest that Congress believed that "relating to" 

2

language meant involving 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No.  But the question is, 

4

when Congress makes a change like that, which we know is 

5

a change for a particular reason because the list of 

6

substances was getting out of control  it's very much 

7

like yesterday's case; I don't know if you're familiar 

8

with that  but Congress makes a change for one reason, 

9

suggests  does not make any  any suggestion that 

10

this change is supposed to do something else and 

11

something much bigger, which is extend this 

12

deportability provision to controlled substances that 

13

aren't part of the Federal list, and there's just no 

14

reason to think that Congress did that in making this 

15

change. 

16

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, the  the 

17

"relating to" language, which is very broad language, is 

18

within the prior statute, and it's within the statute 

19

now.  We don't think there's an indication that Congress 

20

read that statute narrowly in the prior versions.  We 

21

think the plain meaning of that  that language is 

22

quite broad. 

23

 Your Honor, let me just mention. 

There is a 

24

second reason that we've talked principally about the 

25

first one, but the BIA was also entitled to Chevron

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

deference for its separate reasoning pertaining to 

2

paraphernalia.  The BIA has for many, many years 

3

reasoned that there are some crimes that are related to 

4

the drug trade in general, not necessarily to any 

5

individual substance.  And the earliest case on this was 

6

a case about 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8

 MS. KOVNER: 

Espinoza came out when? 
The case I'm thinking of is 

9

MartinezGomez from 1972, which talks about opening a 

10

drug  essentially, opening a drug den, and they say 

11

that's a crime that doesn't necessarily relate just to 

12

any individual substance; it bears a relationship to all 

13

substances.  And then in Martinez Espinoza, more 

14

recently, um the Court 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That was a Federal 

16

crime, though.  It had to relate to a controlled 

17

substance on the Federal list, to all drugs on the 

18

Federal list. 

19

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, the reasoning of 

20

MartinezGomez and then the reasoning of Martinez 

21

Espinoza is that these are crimes that don't necessarily 

22

have to bear a relationship to a single substance.  For 

23

instance, drug paraphernalia are tools that can be used 

24

with multiple substances.  So you might possess, you 

25

know, scales and baggies for the purpose of packaging a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

particular drug on one occasion, but those items can 

2

just as easily facilitate those activities with respect 

3

to 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But a  a sock.  I mean, 

5

one of the strange things about this case is you have a 

6

disjunction.  A sock doesn't count as drug paraphernalia 

7

under the Federal law, but it does under the State law; 

8

it means any container.  And then to take that State 

9

law  I mean, suppose we  we have a conviction for 

10

one of those drugs that's not on the Federal list, just 

11

for possession of that drug, and then we have another 

12

conviction where that drug is inside a sock and it's for 

13

drug paraphernalia. 

14

 So in the one case you would say not 

15

removable, if it's just the substance itself, and in the 

16

other case, because of the sock, it becomes removable? 

17

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, I agree that I 

18

think a strange feature of this case is that it involves 

19

an item that's not usually thought of as drug 

20

paraphernalia.  I think the classic paraphernalia items 

21

and the ones you see most often prosecuted in Kansas and 

22

in other States are things like hyperdermic needles and 

23

scales and substances that are used to mix with drugs 

24

before sale, and I think it's easiest to see in that 

25

case why the BIA's reasoning makes sense, which is,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

those items, when they're possessed by somebody in 

2

connection, even with a Statecontrolled drug, are 

3

tools 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't think that's the 

5

important point that Justice Ginsburg's making.  She's 

6

saying under Federal law, this person can't be convicted 

7

for that drug  that's not a drug on the Federal 

8

list  but it can  or the State list  but can be 

9

convicted, under your theory, for possessing the sock 

10
11
12

and that nonillicit drug in the sock. 
 MS. KOVNER: 

For possessing the sock.  And I 

think it's easiest 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

particular unscheduled item. 

15

 MS. KOVNER: 

With the  with that 

And I think it's easiest to see 

16

why the BIA drew this conclusion when you talk about the 

17

more classical tools of paraphernalia, which is, if 

18

somebody possesses scales and distribution baggies and 

19

cut in connection with a Statecontrolled substance 

20

say it's synthetic marijuana, an item that's not 

21

Federally controlled at the time  those are tools that 

22

could be used in connection with a Federal drug as well. 

23

And so this  the BIA reasoned that there are certain 

24

crimes that  that involve conduct that could 

25

facilitate the distribution of one drug just as easily

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1
2

as another. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do we  do we even know 

3

that this is a  a proper conviction under Kansas law, 

4

that the Kansas statute actually means what it's been 

5

interpreted here to mean?  The Petitioner pled guilty to 

6

this, I think, because he got a break, because he could 

7

have been charged with something  if, in fact, he had 

8

Adderall, which is a Federally controlled substance 

9

he could have been charged with something more serious. 

10

So he pled to this misdemeanor.  But it's really hard to 

11

believe that the Kansas statute actually regards as drug 

12

paraphernalia anything that is used at any time to 

13

contain a controlled substance. 

14

 Suppose somebody buys marijuana or some 

15

other drug and it's in a plastic bag.  So the plastic 

16

bag is  that's one violation.  The person puts it in a 

17

pocket; that's another violation.  The pocket is  is 

18

drug paraphernalia.  Takes it out of the pocket and puts 

19

it in the glove compartment of a car; that's a third 

20

violation.  The car is equipment that's used to store 

21

it.  Takes it out of that, puts it in something  it 

22

it can't really mean this, but we don't have State court 

23

interpretations. 

24
25

 MS. KOVNER: 

That's right.  And if I could 

just make two brief points about that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

 You're right that this was a result of a 

2

plea, and as a result, we don't know exactly what Kansas 

3

courts would say about this application, which is a very 

4

unusual application.  But I think that illustrates, 

5

Justice Alito, I think, the bad consequences of 

6

Petitioner's view, which is, for Petitioner, even if it 

7

was cocaine that was stored in the sock, if he pleads 

8

guilty to the paraphernalia offense, the BIA will lack 

9

any ability to take enforcement action against him, 

10

because he's convicted of a paraphernalia crime, and the 

11

nature of the substance doesn't 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

If he had cocaine in his 

13

sock, he would probably be convicted of possession of 

14

cocaine. 

15

 MS. KOVNER: 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But 
He was convicted of 

17

paraphernalia here because he had four pills of 

18

Adderall, which if you go to half the colleges in 

19

America, people  you know, and just randomly pick 

20

somebody, there would be a decent chance 

21

 (Laughter.) 

22

 MS. KOVNER: 

I think  I think Justice 

23

Alito's explanation of this case explains why that's not 

24

so.  In a plea bargain, prosecutors may be willing to 

25

let somebody plead to a drug paraphernalia offense in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

lieu of a possession offense, and Congress did not want 

2

the fact that a State or local prosecutor allows that 

3

kind of plea bargain to mean that immigration 

4

authorities lack the ability to remove somebody 

5

convicted of a crime that relates to a controlled 

6

substance. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I would have 

8

thought the opposite inference.  If it's not such a big 

9

deal that the State is willing to let him cop a plea to 

10

drug paraphernalia, why should that be the basis for 

11

deportation under Federal law? 

12

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, we don't think that 

13

Congress viewed drug crimes that way.  The way it wrote 

14

this removal provision was to say that any crime 

15

relating to controlled substances permits the BIA to 

16

seek removal.  And that's because, we think, Congress 

17

saw drug crimes as quite serious.  This Court has 

18

recognized that, and Congress has essentially said so in 

19

other statutes.  So we 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but, I mean, 

21

the only  it's because you give "relating to" such a 

22

broad construction that you get the  what I think is 

23

the unusual situation that I talked about, which is that 

24

the State thinks it's a very minor offense and yet it 

25

can become so significant that the person's deported.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

 MS. KOVNER: 

But Petitioner's approach is a 

2

poor way of reading a crime severity distinction into 

3

the statute.  We don't think that's what the language 

4

allows, for minor drug crimes to be set aside as a basis 

5

for 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why is it a poor way?  I 

7

mean, the drugs that the Federal government believes are 

8

the most serious are listed in 802.  And so if you have 

9

to prove, under the modified categorical approach, that 

10

one of those drugs was the intended use, what is so 

11

horrible and  and dissonant about affecting the intent 

12

based on the drugs Congress has chosen to list? 

13

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, it's a bad way 

14

because serious drug crimes involving Federally 

15

controlled substances will not be removable under 

16

Petitioner's view.  And to get 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, no, no, no, no.  We 

18

 I know that you keep saying "for many years," but 

19

it's not that many years.  And the BIA has routinely 

20

required in distribution and possession cases that you 

21

identify the drug. 

22

 MS. KOVNER: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Your 
And so they haven't 

24

found it impossible in thousands of those cases.  It may 

25

be more difficult in the drug paraphernalia case because

Justice Kagan was right.  They're minor offenses; often,

States won't bother with pleas that are very lengthy or

very complex.  But that's a happenstance.  That's not

 MS. KOVNER:

reading of the sentence.  Your Honor, I think if you 

10

look at the BIA cases that we cite on Page 31, they show 

11

that Petitioner's approach will prevent the removal of 

12

aliens committing crimes involving Federally controlled 

13

substances in many cases because the conviction records 

14

aren't going to specify the drug involved. 

15

 Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JON LARAMORE 

19

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

20

 MR. LARAMORE: 

21

not unclear or in flux. 

22

Thank you,  counsel. 

First, the BIA's position is 

 The BIA reaffirmed in a case called Ferreira 

23

last year, cited on page 22 of our reply brief, its 

24

position, just as Justice Sotomayor said, that the 

25

substance has to be identified in um possession and sale

Alderson Reporting Company

1

cases and it has to be an 802 substance.  That's a 

2

system that has been in place for decades.  It has 

3

worked.  It has allowed the deportation of drug 

4

criminals.  It doesn't need to be changed. 

5

 I'd ask the Court to focus on  on 

6

something that  that Ms. Kovner raised, which is what 

7

Congress intended and knew about when it enacted this 

8

version of the statute in 1996, and  I'm sorry, 1986. 

9

And she said that they knew about the Uniform Controlled 

10

Substances Act and that may have had an influence, 

11

although there's nothing that shows in the legislative 

12

history that it did. 

13

 But Congress also knew about the categorical 

14

approach when it put the word "convicted" into the 

15

statute at that time.  And it knew that the categorical 

16

approach and the modified categorical approach would be 

17

used when it  when it invoked the word "convicted." 

18

And that's what we're asking the Court to reaffirm now. 

19

 The word "law" that we've talked about so 

20

much that's in the sentence, or "law and regulation," 

21

is necessary in the statute to support what  another 

22

thing that Congress tried to do in that law, in that 

23

statute, which was to clearly invoke States' authority 

24

and foreign countries' authority to convict  to allow 

25

those convictions to support deportation.  And if

1

there's  it was a convenient way to insert that 

2

concept into the statute. 

3

 I would also point out that the 

4

underpinnings of the Martinez Espinoza case, which is 

5

the one that they rely on now  this is the socalled 

6

drug trade exception, this  which is really just a 

7

drug paraphernalia exception  are not nearly as 

8

strong as the government suggests. 

9

 MartinezGomez is a case about  I'm not 

10

quite sure what you call it  a drug house, a place 

11

where drugs are commonly used.  But there was no 

12

indication in MartinezGomez that it necessarily 

13

involved any substances that were not Section 802 

14

substances. 

15

 It's not very strong support for this 

16

creation out of really whole cloth a drug trade 

17

exception. 

18

 Thank you.
