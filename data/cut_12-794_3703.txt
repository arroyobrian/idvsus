 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

argument next in Case 12794, White v. Woodall. 

5

 Ms. Lenz. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN R. LENZ 

7
8

10

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MS. LENZ: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 This Court has repeatedly held that a State 

11

prisoner cannot obtain habeas relief under AEDPA, unless 

12

State court contravenes or unreasonably applies clearly 

13

established Federal law. 

14

 In this case, there was no clearly 

15

established Federal law.  Under any interpretation of 

16

Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell, this Court has never 

17

extended Carter to the selection phase of a capital 

18

sentencing trial.  Because there is no clearly 

19

established Federal law, the Kentucky Supreme Court was 

20

well within its authority to resolve this unresolved 

21

question in favor of affirming the sentence. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Lenz, could I ask you 

23

about what you just said?  You said Carter, Estelle, and 

24

Mitchell; those are the three.  So Carter says the Fifth 

25

Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a noadverseinference jury instruction when requested 

2

by a defendant.  And that was, of course, not a 

3

sentencing case. 

4

 Then Estelle says, we discern no basis to 

5

distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of 

6

Respondent's capital murder trial, so far as the 

7

protection of the Fifth Amendment, so a kind of general 

8

view that the Fifth Amendment applies equally in the 

9

two. 

10

 And then Mitchell holds  it basically 

11

repeats that from Estelle and says, we must accord the 

12

privilege the same protection in the sentencing phase of 

13

any criminal case, as that which is due in the trial 

14

phase. 

15

 So when you put those together, Carter with 

16

Estelle, Mitchell, how  why do you think that there's 

17

a gap? 

18

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, there's  there is a gap 

19

between Mitchell and Carter.  First of all, Mitchell was 

20

not a jury instruction case.  In Mitchell, while the 

21

defendant did plead guilty, she did not plead guilty to 

22

all of the conduct, so there were still factors that 

23

were being contested. 

24
25

 In this case, Mr. Woodall pled guilty to all 
of the crimes and aggravating circumstances.  Mitchell

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and Estelle were both concerned with protecting the 

2

defendant from the prosecution shifting its burden of 

3

proof to the defendant. 

4

 In this case, there was no  there was no 

5

burden shifting because Robert Keith Woodall had already 

6

pleaded guilty to the facts, which the prosecutor was 

7

required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, to render 

8

Mr. Woodall eligible for the death penalty. 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you think it would 

10

have been okay for the trial court to instruct the jury 

11

that they could use the defendant's silence against him? 

12

Would the affirmative statement have been constitutional 

13

and not a violation of the Fifth Amendment? 

14

 MS. LENZ: 

I do not think it would have been 

15

proper.  Under Kentucky law, the attorney could not 

16

refer to 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, I didn't ask about 

18

Kentucky law.  Do you think the Fifth Amendment permits 

19

the judge to have said, use silence? 

20

 MS. LENZ: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22

No. 
Use silence to punish 

him because he's just a bad person. 

23

 MS. LENZ: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I don't think so. 
I mean, that doesn't 
Under Federal law, you

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't think the judge could say, ladies and gentlemen of 

2

the jury, this defendant has already pleaded guilty to a 

3

horrible crime.  This is a punishment hearing.  He has 

4

chosen not to  not to testify in this  in this 

5

hearing. 

6

 You  you are  if you wish, you may take 

7

his failure to testify as an indication that he does not 

8

have remorse, that he is not sorry.  He could have come 

9

before you said and, said I am terribly sorry, I wish I 

10

had never done it, I will never do it again.  He has 

11

chosen not to testify.  You may, if you wish, take that 

12

into account in determining whether  whether there is 

13

remorse.  You can't say that. 

14

 MS. LENZ: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16
17

Oh, absolutely.  Absolutely. 
Well, then, your answer 

should have been otherwise. 
 MS. LENZ: 

Well, I guess I interpreted 

18

Justice Sotomayor's question a little bit different 

19

because she wasn't referring to facts in evidence or 

20

or to some type of evidence, but your question asks 

21

the  the question about whether silence bears on the 

22

determination of a lack of remorse. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24

 MS. LENZ: 

25

Of course. 
And Mitchell specifically left 

that open.  In fact, Mitchell 

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, there was a 

2

factual dispute as to how much the witness  the victim 

3

had suffered.  How about a statement about that? 

4

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, I don't think there was 

5

actually a dispute about how much the victim suffered. 

6

There, I think, you're referring to the testimony of 

7

the blood spatter expert where  wherein he was talking 

8

about how the blood was splattered around,and it indicated 

9

that there had been quite a struggle when the victim's 

10

throat was slashed. 

11

 And trial counsel 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But take the  take the 

13

hypothetical, Ms. Lenz, that suppose  you know, the 

14

prosecutor had said you just heard testimony from our 

15

expert that  the blood spattering expert, that the 

16

victim's suffering was especially prolonged, and look, 

17

the defendant didn't take the stand.  Why didn't he take 

18

the stand to deny that?  All right? 

19
20
21

 So could the prosecutor have said that at 
the sentencing hearing? 
 MS. LENZ: 

Yes, Justice Kagan.  The 

22

prosecutor could have said that because that is a 

23

selection factor.  That  the fact of whether the 

24

victim struggled is not a fact that makes the defendant 

25

eligible for the death penalty, so because the  the

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prosecutor had no burden of proof on that, the defendant 

2

wasn't in  in jeopardy of having the burden shifted to 

3

him. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So you're suggesting that 

5

what we haven't decided, if you will, goes beyond the 

6

remorse question of  that we  that we talked about 

7

in  not Mitchell, but  is it Mitchell? 

8

 MS. LENZ: 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mitchell, yes. 
It goes beyond the remorse 

10

question.  And you're saying that really, in the 

11

sentencing hearing, the Fifth Amendment has nothing to 

12

do with  with anything that happens there essentially, 

13

because once  once the person has been found eligible 

14

for the death penalty, a prosecutor and a jury can 

15

can draw whatever inferences they want. 

16

 MS. LENZ: 

I think that the core purpose of 

17

the Fifth Amendment has  has been protected.  Yes, I 

18

do. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What do we do about  I 

20

mean, I think the relevant pages are  it's at 526 U.S. 

21

328 to 330, probably read those 17 times.  All right. 

22

When I looked at those, I saw they reaffirm Estelle. 

23

As they quote Estelle, they say its reasoning applies 

24

with full force.  Estelle says, "The court could discern 

25

no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

phases of Respondent's capital trial so far as the 

2

protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege is 

3

concerned." 

4

 I marked five separate statements in those 

5

two pages that came to the same thing.  I looked at 

6

Estelle.  Estelle has to do with the right to note 

7

note the comment that he wanted in respect to a 

8

sentencing fact that the jury was going to decide; 

9

namely, future dangerousness.  Nothing to do with a fact 

10

about the crime, a sentencing fact. 

11

 So then I said, well, what favors you here? 

12

What favors you is the last sentence of the first 

13

paragraph on 330, which says, "Whether silence bears 

14

upon the determination of a lack of remorse or upon 

15

acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the 

16

downward adjustment provided in 3E1.1 of U.S. Sentencing 

17

Guidelines is a separate question.  It is not before us 

18

and we express no view on it." 

19

 Right. 

It's, one, not just a sentencing 

20

fact, but a state of mind of the defendant, lack of 

21

remorse; two, it's in the sentencing guidelines; three, 

22

it is a decision for a judge, not the jury.  If it isn't 

23

confined, as I just said it, then Mitchell overrules 

24

Estelle, what it explicitly denies doing.  Here, we have 

25

sentencing facts, facts about his childhood.

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 He wanted the Estelle instruction. 

The 

2

judge wouldn't give it.  That's the argument against 

3

you, I think.  And I would like to hear your specific 

4

response. 

5

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, in Estelle, that sentencing 

6

Factor is future dangerousness, and the prosecution had to 

7

prove that beyond a reasonable doubt, in order to make 

8

Mr. Smith eligible for the death penalty.  That's a very 

9

different fact than a factor of what you're speaking 

10

about, which would be a selection factor and the 

11

prosecution has 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I thought the 

13

facts  what was at issue here, he has put on witnesses 

14

that show that he had a bad childhood, and he didn't 

15

himself testify about his bad childhood.  And in that 

16

context, he asked for the no silence/silence 

17

instruction.  The government did not object.  The judge 

18

then refused to give the instruction. 

19

 All right. 

Now, what's the difference 

20

between the facts about how his parents raised him and 

21

the fact of future dangerousness in Estelle? 

22

 MS. LENZ: 

The difference is the burden of 

23

proof.  How his parents raised him is a mitigating 

24

circumstance.  Mr. Woodall had the burden of proof on 

25

mitigating circumstances.  The jury was instructed they

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

had to consider the mitigating circumstances.  So 

2

whether Mr. Woodall testified or not, we assume that the 

3

jury followed the instructions and considered the 

4

mitigating circumstances. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Ms. Lenz, am I correct, the 

6

instruction that was requested but not given was as 

7

follows, quote, "A defendant is not compelled to testify 

8

and the fact that the defendant did not testify should 

9

not prejudice him in any way."  That was the 

10

instruction? 

11

 MS. LENZ: 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes, sir. 
So suppose that the  you 

13

put on evidence of  to show that he was qualified for 

14

the death penalty and put on evidence of aggravating 

15

factors, and the defense put on absolutely no mitigation 

16

evidence.  The instruction would say, would it not, that 

17

the fact that the defendant did not testify should not 

18

prejudice him in any way with respect to the failure to 

19

put on any mitigation evidence at all; is that correct? 

20

 MS. LENZ: 

That's exactly right, Your Honor. 

21

That's exactly right.  So, in essence, it really shifts 

22

the burden of proof  Mr. Woodall's burden of proof 

23

back to the prosecution. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

In this case, of course, 

the question is even narrower.  That instruction would

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

forbid the jury from even taking into account his 

2

failure to testify on  on the one factor of remorse 

3

the one psychological factor of remorse. 

4

 And if you say that you're not entitled to 

5

such an instruction on that, that alone would have 

6

would have been enough to deny the requested 

7

instruction. 

8
9
10
11
12
13
14

 MS. LENZ: 

That's exactly right.  That's 

exactly right.  And I think the judge indicates 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you call him, to 

ask him if he feels sorry? 
 If he has no Fifth Amendment right, could 
you call him to the stand and ask him, are you sorry? 
 MS. LENZ: 

No, Justice Sotomayor, because 

15

there are two rulings in Mitchell, and the first ruling 

16

in Mitchell says that  said that Mitchell still had 

17

the Fifth Amendment right in the sentencing proceeding 

18

after the guilty plea.  That's the first ruling in 

19

Mitchell. 

20

 But the second ruling in Mitchell then 

21

limits that.  It doesn't say there are no adverses  no 

22

adverse inferences whatsoever that cannot be inferred.  It 

23

says no adverse inferences can be inferred on facts and 

24

circumstances that the prosecutor is required to prove 

25

which increase the penalty range.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So there's a difference. 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So 
Is your position, 

3

basically, that this is in the nature of a  an 

4

affirmative defense and that defendant carries the 

5

burden on remorse  and what was the other one that 

6

Mitchell saved out?  Acceptance of responsibility? 

7

 MS. LENZ: 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

9
10

Yes.  Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 
So if defendant says 

nothing, then he hasn't  he hasn't proved a mitigator. 
 MS. LENZ: 

That's right, and  and he bears 

11

the burden of proof on that, and he bears the 

12

consequences from failing to meet his burden on that. 

13

The prosecution has absolutely no burden with regard to 

14

mitigating circumstances. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So would it have been an 

16

acceptable and workable rule to say that, in a 

17

sentencing hearing, on any point where the defendant has 

18

the burden of proof the government is entitled to 

19

testimony, that silence can be the basis for an adverse 

20

inference? 

21

 MS. LENZ: 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Could you repeat the question? 
Would it be an acceptable, 

23

workable rule to say that in a sentencing hearing, on 

24

any issue where the defendant has the burden of proof 

25

the prosecution is entitled to an instruction that

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

silence can be the basis for an inference against the 

2

defendant on those issues? 

3

 (Pause.) 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I mean, you have to either 

5

say yes or no.  If  if you say no, then I ask why 

6

remorse is different?  If you say yes, then remorse is 

7

included within that. 

8
9
10
11
12
13

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, I think no, and remorse is 

different because, again, that's a mitigating 
circumstance upon which Woodall has the burden of proof. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  What did you 

just say? 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I don't understand why 

14

you're not entitled to the instruction on all issues as 

15

to which the defendant has the burden of proof 

16

 MS. LENZ: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

18
19

Well, it makes sense 
 in a sentencing 

hearing. 
 MS. LENZ: 

It makes sense to not  the 

20

purpose of the noadverseinference instruction is to 

21

protect the defendant from the prosecution shifting its 

22

burden of proof, in other words, using his silence to 

23

prove one of the elements that the prosecution is 

24

required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The  the assumption in

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

my question is that the defendant has the burden of 

2

proof on a certain number of issues in the sentencing 

3

hearing.  As to all of those issues, it seems to me it 

4

has to be your position that the government is entitled 

5

to the instruction that I described. 

6

 Or you're just going to stand up and say, 

7

well, remorse is different, but I  we need to know 

8

what  what your argument is. 

9
10
11

 MS. LENZ: 

You need to know why remorse is 

different, is that what you're asking? 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

12

asking it, yes. 

13

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, that's one way of 

Yes.  Well, I think it would be 

14

the same answer.  It's just that remorse is a mitigating 

15

circumstance, and the prosecution has no burden of proof 

16

on mitigating circumstances.  That's the defendant's 

17

choice as to whether he wants to place evidence in the 

18

record regarding any mitigating circumstances 

19

whatsoever. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, when a party has the 

21

burden of producing evidence on something, isn't the 

22

customary way of dealing with that to instruct the jury 

23

that the defendant had the burden of producing evidence 

24

to show this, rather than to  to talk about inferences 

25

that can be drawn from their failure, from that party's

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

failure to produce evidence. 
 MS. LENZ: 

Well, in this case, the jury was 

3

not instructed that Mr. Woodall had the burden of proof 

4

on the mitigating circumstances.  They were instructed 

5

to consider the mitigating circumstances. 

6
7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They also weren't 

instructed to draw any inferences, were they? 

8

 MS. LENZ: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, they were not. 
I mean, the  the issue 

10

here is whether you must instruct them not to draw 

11

inferences, not  not whether  whether  anyway. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, the jury was 

13

instructed, "You shall consider such mitigating or 

14

extenuating facts and circumstances as have been 

15

presented to you in the evidence and you believe to be 

16

true." 

17

 Now, I suppose they could have been  the 

18

mitigating evidence could have been put in by the 

19

prosecution, but for the most part, they're going to be 

20

put in by the defense.  So when the judge says you can 

21

consider whatever mitigating evidence has been presented 

22

to you, isn't that tantamount to saying that the 

23

defendant has the burden of producing evidence of 

24

mitigation, if the defendant wants to do that? 

25

 MS. LENZ: 

I don't think it speaks to who

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has the burden.  It just speaks to the fact that they're 

2

required to consider 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought we  it wasn't 

4

controversial that, on mitigating factors, the defendant 

5

does have the burden. 

6
7
8
9

 MS. LENZ: 

He does.  He does.  That's 

correct. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So is  is there a 

difference between the prosecutor saying, judge, I want 

10

you to charge this jury that they can use defendant's 

11

silence against him, or a judge, on his own, telling the 

12

jury that, or the judge, as here, simply refusing to say 

13

you can't take it into account? 

14

 MS. LENZ: 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

16
17

Well, I do think 
Are all those the same, 

or would you distinguish them? 
 MS. LENZ: I do, I think there  there is a 

18

difference between the prosecution and the court not 

19

telling the jury that, that they can take the 

20

defendant's silence into consideration, I do. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, where does that 

22

difference come from?  Because I thought that, every 

23

time and in every circumstance that we've prohibited an 

24

adverse inference, we've also required a requested jury 

25

instruction.  I don't know of a  of a case or any

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

principle that would suggest that we can tear those two 

2

things apart and say, well, look, an adverse inference 

3

is prohibited, but, no, you don't get an instruction. 

4

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, the  the only situation 

5

that I'm aware of that the Court has  that it has 

6

extended Griffin with this Carter instruction is in the 

7

guilt phase, where the prosecution is still required 

8

to prove guilt. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I'm asking a 

10

different question.  Do you have any case that suggests 

11

that those two things don't go hand and hand?  Because 

12

my  my sort of reading of our case law is that they 

13

do.  Any time we've said an adverse inference is 

14

prohibited, we've also said the defendant is titled 

15

is entitled to an instruction about adverse inferences 

16

if he requests it. 

17

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, you said that, in every 

18

case, but one, I suppose, except for Mitchell, and 

19

that's the most important case here.  The Court in 

20

Mitchell said that the jury couldn't infer anything 

21

negative from the facts and circumstances of the crime 

22

upon which the prosecutor 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I didn't see that in 

24

Mitchell.  But let  let me go back, just elaborating 

25

on that, to Justice Alito's first question.  I want to

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

see if this issue is still in the case.  You looked at 

2

the instruction, and the instruction is just a broad 

3

instruction.  It says no adverse inference may be drawn 

4

from anything.  All right. 

5

 So there seemed to be some objection you had 

6

to the breadth of that instruction, so I looked at the 

7

instruction.  The instruction does say exactly what 

8

Justice Alito said and you have said.  It says the 

9

the instruction is  "The defendant is not compelled to 

10

testify, and the fact that he does not cannot be used as 

11

inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in any 

12

way," with a couple of, here, irrelevant modifications. 

13

All right? 

14

 The instruction I just read you is not from 

15

this case.  It's from the Carter case.  In the Carter 

16

case, the court said that instruction must be given.  It 

17

must be given at the sentencing phase.  So what they did 

18

was copy the instruction out of the case, the very 

19

instruction that the court said, in Carter, the Fifth 

20

Amendment requires to be given in the sentencing phase. 

21

And that was a noncapital case. 

22

 So what's the objection to the instruction, 

23

on its breadth?  Not only is it the same, but the 

24

government never objected that it was too broad, and the 

25

only issues in the case were factual.  They were about

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what happened to him in his childhood, namely, 

2

sentencing facts. 

3

 And the instruction that you did read about 

4

what they should consider referred to facts and 

5

circumstances.  And where, in Estelle, does it say that 

6

matters at sentencing related to facts and 

7

circumstances, you don't have to give the very 

8

instruction that Carter and Estelle required? 

9

 MS. LENZ: 

All right.  I have several things 

10

to say.  First of all, I disagree with two things, 

11

respectfully, that you said about Carter.  The 

12

instruction in Carter was different.  The instruction in 

13

Carter was about guilt, and actually  and Mr. Woodall 

14

concedes  they left that part out of this instruction. 

15

This instruction says no negative inferences about 

16

anything whatsoever.  That's not what Carter said. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MS. LENZ: 

I see. 
Carter is talking about guilt, 

19

and it's limited.  And also, the Carter instruction had 

20

to do with the guilt phase, rather than the sentencing 

21

phase.  And Estelle was not a jury instruction case and 

22

didn't say anything about Carter whatsoever.  So Estelle 

23

didn't extend Carter at all. 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

though, the sentencing aspect.

But Mitchell did, 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MS. LENZ: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3
4

I'm sorry? 
Mitchell was about 

sentencing. 
 MS. LENZ: 

Yes, Mitchell was about 

5

sentencing.  And Mitchell is the case which answers 

6

the  the last part of  your question, Justice Breyer. 

7

You said where does it say facts and circumstances of 

8

the crime?  That language is in Mitchell. 

9

 Mitchell clearly says that no adverse 

10

inferences may be made on facts and circumstances of the 

11

crime upon which the prosecution has the burden of proof 

12

and  and upon which will increase 

13
14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Does it overrule  does it 

overrule Estelle? 

15

 MS. LENZ: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Does Mitchell overrule Estelle? 
Yes.  Does Mitchell 

17

Estelle talks about  you apply the same rule to facts 

18

and circumstances of the sentence, in a capital case 

19

anyway. 

20
21

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, I don't think Mitchell says 

that.  It's not that broad. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

 MS. LENZ: 

No, Mitchell doesn't. 
Or excuse me.  Estelle doesn't 

24

say that.  Estelle's not that broad.  It doesn't speak 

25

about a jury instruction, and even Mitchell doesn't

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say  it  it says something very broad, the Fifth 

2

Amendment applies during the penalty phase, but it 

3

doesn't make a distinction between the eligibility part 

4

of the penalty phase and the selection part of the 

5

penalty phase. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But in not making that 

7

distinction, I mean, it does speak very broadly, and it 

8

says  you know, I'm reading another quotation from it. 

9

"The rule against negative inferences at a criminal 

10
11

trial apply with equal force at sentencing." 
 Now, it does have this exception for remorse 

12

or a possible exception for remorse.  But with that 

13

exception, otherwise, it says the rule against adverse 

14

inferences applies, doesn't it? 

15

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, the rule against adverse 

16

inferences from Carter is all about incrimination and 

17

guilt.  And in this case, Mr. Woodall's pled guilty to 

18

all of the crimes and aggravating circumstances.  So his 

19

eligibility for the death penalty was already met before 

20

the penalty phase even began. 

21

 And I'm sorry. 

What was your question? 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I think my question was just 

23

the breadth of these statements about everything that 

24

applies at trial with respect to adverse inferences also 

25

applies at the sentencing phase, with the possible

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exception of adverse inferences about remorse.  That's 

2

the way I read the cases. 

3

 MS. LENZ: 

Well, I'm not sure I agree with 

4

your reading of the cases, but even if  even if that 

5

is the correct reading of the case and that adverse 

6

inferences apply to everything, but factors such as lack 

7

of remorse or downward adjustment in the sentencing 

8

guidelines, that leaves a huge hole in Mitchell. 

9

 You could drive a truck through that hole 

10

because, as Justice Scalia pointed out in his dissent in 

11

Mitchell, the bulk of what sentencing is about are these 

12

other factors, the other factors, what kind of childhood 

13

he had, mitigation and all of that sort of thing.  So 

14

there's still a lot of room. 

15
16

 If I may, I'd like to reserve the remainder 
of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 Mr. Komp.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE E. KOMP, 

20

 APPOINTED BY THIS COURT, 

21

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

22
23
24
25

 MR. KOMP: 

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 In Estelle, this Court held that there are 
no  there's no basis to distinguish between guilt and

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

penalty phases in a capital trial.  Mitchell did not 

2

disturb that ruling  did not overrule that ruling. 

3

As  as this Court indicated, the key components of the 

4

Mitchell opinion that have been discussed today are from 

5

pages 328 to 330.  And on  those pages are littered 

6

with the discussion of what the clear principles of this 

7

Court's authority are. 

8

 For instance, on page 329, "Our holding 

9

today is a product of existing precedent, not only 

10

Griffin, but also by Estelle v. Smith, in which the 

11

Court could discern no basis to distinguish between the 

12

guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital murder 

13

trial, so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment 

14

privilege is concerned." 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the courts in those 

16

cases had a specific issue before it.  Its attention 

17

wasn't called to what I suggested is in the nature of an 

18

affirmative defense.  The defendant has the burden to 

19

persuade the jury on mitigators. 

20

 MR. KOMP: 

Your Honor, if I may, and just 

21

to  to  under Kentucky law, there is  I think 

22

Justice Alito sort of spoke to this  or I forget which 

23

Justice.  There's a difference between a burden of 

24

production and a burden of proof.  And absolutely, a 

25

a defendant in  in a sentencing hearing has the burden

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of production, as a proponent of what is going to be 

2

their mitigation theory. 

3

 That's much different than a burden of 

4

proof.  In this case, Instruction 6, which is found at 

5

Joint Appendix Page 44, the burden of proof was on the 

6

government to establish that the aggravating 

7

circumstances, both the statutory aggravating 

8

circumstances and the nonstatutory aggravating 

9

circumstances, had to outweigh the mitigating evidence. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Let me  let me give you 

11

this example.  Let me pretend to be a juror in a  in a 

12

Kentucky capital case.  And the  and let's assume in 

13

this case the prosecution puts on evidence to show 

14

eligibility and some evidence of aggravating factors. 

15

The defense puts on no evidence of mitigation. 

16

 Now, the judge tells me you shall consider 

17

such mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances 

18

as have been presented to you in the evidence, and you 

19

believe to be true.  Okay?  That's Instruction Number 4. 

20

I assume that you don't have an objection to that. 

21

 And then the judge gives the instruction 

22

that you requested, a defendant is not compelled to 

23

testify, and the fact that the defendant did not testify 

24

should not prejudice him in any way. 

25

 So, now, I'm back in the jury room, and I

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say, well, now I have to consider mitigating evidence. 

2

And  you know, there are a lot of things that could be 

3

mitigating in a capital case.  I'd like to know about 

4

the defendant's childhood.  I'd like to know whether the 

5

defendant was  was abused.  I'd like to know whether 

6

the defendant was remorseful. 

7

 And I haven't heard anything about this. 

8

And I don't know what to do because the judge told me I 

9

should consider the mitigating evidence that's been 

10

presented to me.  On the other hand, the judge told me 

11

that the failure  the fact that the defendant didn't 

12

put on any mitigating evidence can't prejudice him in 

13

any way.  So what am I supposed to do? 

14

 MR. KOMP: 

Well, in that case, again, if 

15

if there's no mitigating evidence presented, you don't 

16

know if it's what Instruction 4 will look  look like. 

17

But taking your hypothetical, and you're in that jury 

18

room, if you're given the Carter instruction  again, 

19

it wasn't given in this case.  So if you're given that 

20

Carter instruction, all that prohibits is  is raising 

21

a negative inference against the defendant for the 

22

failure to exercise his right to testify. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, it doesn't really.  It 

24

says the fact that he didn't testify, and he could have 

25

testified about child  about his childhood or about

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

remorse or any of these other things, that shouldn't 

2

prejudice him in any way. 

3
4
5

 MR. KOMP: 

And that's right  that's the 

that's straight out of the Carter 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, just tell me what I'm 

6

supposed to do as a juror.  The judge says consider the 

7

evidence that's put before you, but the fact that the 

8

defendant didn't put this evidence before you in the 

9

form of his testimony shouldn't prejudice him in any 

10

way.  I'm  I'm pulled in two different directions.  I 

11

don't know what to do. 

12

 MR. KOMP: 

Well  but he can't  again, I 

13

think, in your hypothetical, that he's presented 

14

nothing.  And so he can't be penalized, again, for 

15

presenting nothing.  And you can't allow 

16
17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Nothing  zero equals 

zero. 

18

 MR. KOMP: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Correct.  And so 
And the zero just can't 

20

be added onto or taken away from.  Zero is zero, not a 

21

positive, not a negative. 

22

 MR. KOMP: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right.  And 
So you can't take away 

24

from the zero, create evidence from his silence, just as 

25

you can't from his silence outweigh the aggravating

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

circumstances; correct? 

2

 MR. KOMP: 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Correct. 
But that still doesn't 

4

answer Justice Alito's dilemma.  You say he can't be 

5

penalized for doing nothing, but the juror in Justice 

6

Alito's hypothetical says, what am I supposed to do when 

7

he didn't present anything, and I'm concerned about 

8

that?  I don't think you've answered the question. 

9

 MR. KOMP: 

In  in that circumstance, 

10

again, he  he can't  they can't  for instance, 

11

Kentucky is a nonweighing State, so that means that they 

12

can  that nonstatutory aggravation is on the table, 

13

anything they want to consider. 

14

 And what this Carter instruction would 

15

prohibit is  is preventing his failure to testify, his 

16

failure to offer a lack of remorse, to say, I'm sorry, 

17

which are the natural inclinations of what jurors 

18

natural inclinations, but constitutionally impermissible 

19

inclinations, from adding that onto the death side of 

20

the scale.  And you're right 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Was there any other 

22

defendant didn't say, I'm sorry.  Was there  was there 

23

anything else?  Did the defendant produce anything else 

24

in the way of remorse? 

25

 MR. KOMP: 

In this  in this case, no.

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Remorse was not a mitigation theory that was presented 

2

by defense counsel. 

3
4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

A low IQ and a personality 

disorder, I take it, were the mitigating factors? 

5

 MR. KOMP: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Correct. 
So in a case where there 

7

are witnesses who says there are two mitigating factors, 

8

he has a very low IQ and he has a personality disorder, 

9

he says nothing.  The jurors go in the room.  They have 

10

to decide does he have a low IQ and personality disorder 

11

and what weight should we give that as mitigators? 

12

 This instruction says, jurors, do it. 

Just, 

13

when you do it, don't take account of the fact that he, 

14

himself, did not testify. 

15

 MR. KOMP: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Correct. 
Is that  that  so that 

17

jurors are perfectly clear, I would think.  What I think 

18

is difficult for you is just what your friend raised. 

19

It is true that the Carter instruction refers to guilt. 

20

You took that instruction, word for word, and you've cut 

21

out "guilt" because this has nothing to do with guilt, 

22

right. 

23

 Estelle says, I would think, that you have a 

24

right to a Carter instruction in respect to some 

25

sentencing factors, namely future dangerousness.  The

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

last sentence on the page of Mitchell says, we are not 

2

deciding whether you're entitled to that instruction in 

3

respect to other sentencing  factors, namely, 

4

remorse. 

5

 So the question for you is why does that 

6

thing  that sentence about remorse in Mitchell, why 

7

isn't it at least ambiguous about whether your client is 

8

entitled to that instruction here? 

9
10

 And your response to that is what? 
 MR. KOMP: 

My  my response to that is 

11

is twofold.  One, as  in  as this Court was walking 

12

through in the opening presentation, Mitchell was not 

13

overruled  or, I'm sorry, Estelle was not overruled by 

14

Mitchell.  It relied on Estelle and the Griffin line of 

15

cases as the  as the clearly existing authority. 

16

 When you get to that 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Estelle might not have 

18

been overruled, but there's a caveat that Mitchell puts 

19

in, and it's a caveat about remorse and that remorse 

20

might be different. 

21

 And the question is why doesn't that caveat 

22

suggest, at the very least, that the instruction that 

23

you asked for was so broad that it went beyond what this 

24

Court has decided because the instruction that you asked 

25

for did not distinguish remorse from other issues that

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were going to come before the jury at the sentencing 

2

phase. 

3

 So at the very least, it seems that 

4

instruction sort of blows by the question that we have 

5

reserved. 

6

 MR. KOMP: 

Two points, and one is, when this 

7

instruction was requested, Mitchell had not been 

8

decided.  So the slate was Griffin, Carter, Estelle, and 

9

Mitchell came out prior to the Kentucky Supreme Court's 

10

ruling.  So this instruction was based on  you know, 

11

without the reservation that exists. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but then the 

13

reservation certainly suggests that, at the time the 

14

instruction was requested, it wasn't beyond any 

15

fairminded dispute, which is the standard.  No one's 

16

talked about the standard yet.  The standard is that 

17

which you're complaining about  that the error has to 

18

be so well understood and comprehended in existing law 

19

to be beyond any possibility of fairminded 

20

disagreement. 

21

 And it seems to me if, shortly after the 

22

instruction was requested, the court itself said, oh, 

23

that's different, we're not talking about that, it 

24

certainly suggests that it was a subject of fairminded 

25

disagreement.

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KOMP: 

I think you have  we have to 

2

examine what Mitchell  Mitchell, again, was framed as 

3

a Federal sentencing guidelines case, and that passage I 

4

read earlier from Mitchell, the next sentence is, "And 

5

although Estelle was a capital case, its reasoning 

6

applies with full force here, where the government seeks 

7

to use Petitioner's silence to infer commission of 

8

disputed acts." 

9

 And what  what this Court was doing was 

10

extending Estelle into the Federal sentencing guidelines 

11

case, and it wasn't at the same time cutting back on 

12

Estelle the Fifth  the recognition that the Fifth 

13

Amendment applies at the capital sentencing. 

14

 Our read of that exception  the language, 

15

is that whether silence bears upon the determination of 

16

lack of remorse or upon acceptance of responsibility for 

17

purposes of the downward adjustment provided in the 

18

sentencing guidelines is a separate question. 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Not only that.  Your 

20

position must be that that is so clear as to be beyond 

21

fairminded disagreement. 

22
23

 MR. KOMP: 

It's clear that that relates to 

fair  to Federal sentencing guidelines cases. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

 MR. KOMP: 

Right. 

Or possibly noncapital cases,

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because this Court didn't simultaneously accept Estelle 

2

as the clearly existing law and then cut it. 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but you're 

4

saying it has to be clear, objectively beyond reasonable 

5

disagreement, to say that, when the court says lack of 

6

remorse in a sentencing guideline case, it still thinks 

7

there's a different rule for lack of remorse in a 

8

selection case such as this. 

9

 MR. KOMP: 

But I think the answer is found 

10

within Estelle because Estelle was based on the future 

11

dangerousness, and the psychiatrist that  or, pardon 

12

me, psychologist that testified in Estelle, his finding 

13

of future dangerousness, which is a selection question 

14

which has nothing to do with eligibility, his finding of 

15

future dangerousness was based on lack of remorse. 

16

Estelle isn't just a compulsion case.  There's  a 

17

component of silence. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I thought your 

19

friend told us that future dangerousness was an 

20

eligibility factor, rather than a mere selection 

21

criteria. 

22

 MR. KOMP: 

Under this Court's  the then 

23

Texas statute, as defined by this Court in Jurek, that 

24

special circumstances question at that time was a 

25

selection factor.  It was not an eligibility factor.

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Eligibility had already been determined.  And that's 

2

based on this Court's authority of Jurek.  And we  and 

3

we cited to State v. Beathard in the Red Brief, which is 

4

Texas's description of their  of those special 

5

circumstances questions at the time. 

6

 So this Court has applied this Fifth 

7

Amendment prohibition in a pure sentencing selection 

8

occasion, and Estelle deals with  there's a component 

9

of silence to it because the psychologist that testified 

10

as to the future dangerousness factor relied on the 

11

silence of the individual, his failure specifically to 

12

say, I'm sorry, and express remorse about the actions 

13

that he did.  And this Court cited that component as 

14

part of what the psychologist relied on in making the 

15

future dangerousness assessment. 

16

 So Estelle is not totally  it obviously 

17

has a compulsion component, and it's driven by the 

18

Miranda violation, but there is a component of Estelle 

19

which relies specifically on silence and how the silence 

20

was used to penalize the individual in becoming a factor 

21

in favor of death in the selection process. 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I'm curious about one 

23

facet of this case.  This instruction was sought by the 

24

defendant.  The prosecutor had no objection to it.  The 

25

judge said, I'm sorry, I am not going to use that

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

instruction. 
 Is that common in Kentucky, that both 

3

parties agree that an instruction should be given, and 

4

the judge says, I'm not going to give it? 

5

 MR. KOMP: 

I  I can't speak  I don't 

6

want to speak too broadly for what happens, but it's 

7

I think when both parties usually agree, the instruction 

8

is given, but I don't want to stretch it too far and say 

9

that on every occasion. 

10

 And I  I think it's important because this 

11

was a  the fact that the government didn't 

12

object  you know, demonstrates that  that the 

13

instruction should have been given.  If he  if he felt 

14

that this instruction shouldn't have been given, or 

15

there was no legal basis for the instruction 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It doesn't demonstrate 

17

anything of the sort.  It just means that he didn't 

18

object. 

19

 MR. KOMP: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I  I think 
Maybe he was a very bad 

21

lawyer.  Who knows?  We're  we're going to determine 

22

our law on the basis of whether a government lawyer made 

23

an objection or not? 

24

 MR. KOMP: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I 
At most, it shows that he

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

didn't think that there was anything wrong with it. 

2

Does that mean we have to think there was nothing wrong 

3

with it? 

4

 MR. KOMP: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

 MR. KOMP: 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Oh, absolutely not, Your Honor. 
Okay. 
Absolutely not.  And 
Well, what it may show is 

8

that the prosecutor didn't think that it was going to 

9

make a difference, and so why raise an objection that 

10

could create everything that's happened since then, over 

11

something that isn't going to make a difference in a 

12

case where you have an incredibly heinous crime? 

13

 The prosecutor may have thought, this jury 

14

is going to return the verdict that I want anyway, even 

15

if this instruction is given. 

16

 MR. KOMP: 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

18
19

I think that 
You don't think that's a 

possibility? 
 MR. KOMP: 

I  I think as a  as a lawyer, 

20

if you  your  the basis of your objection or your 

21

failure to object is based on what you believe is  is 

22

legally required, especially when you're a prosecutor, 

23

and  and you have that added burden of not seeking a 

24

conviction or not seeking the death sentence 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What I say  what we said

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here, what I've gathered from the record, as best we've 

2

been able to see it, is in that sentencing hearing 

3

you were there? 

4

 MR. KOMP: 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

6

I was not. 

well. 

7

 MR. KOMP: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

But you know it pretty 

Yes. 
Okay.  There were five 

matters at issue.  He had a low IQ, a personality 

10

disorder, the child of a troubled home, he had grown 

11

up in poverty, he had been sexually abused.  All right. 

12

All of those things are basically factual matters about 

13

his background. 

14

 Now, in that context, this instruction, 

15

which was the Carter instruction without the word 

16

"guilt," referring to his failure to testify is 

17

doesn't mention those five things specifically.  It 

18

doesn't say testify about those five things. 

19

 But in context, was there anything else in 

20

that hearing that the jury could have thought failure to 

21

testify referred to? 

22

 MR. KOMP: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The  in  in 
Is there anything else any 

24

juror might have thought, oh, he didn't testify about 

25

this other thing, too?  Was there some other thing

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

there? 
 MR. KOMP: 

It doesn't, Your Honor, it just 

3

doesn't go to mitigation because I  I think that 

4

goes 

5
6
7
8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's not what I'm 

thinking of. 
 MR. KOMP: 

But  but  right.  But it 

goes 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm thinking of what is it 

10

that we  is there an issue in this case about whether 

11

the instruction, on top of whatever other problems it 

12

had, was too broad? 

13

 So I'm thinking, if that was the only issue, 

14

if those are the only issues that this instruction could 

15

have been thought of as referring to, we don't have to 

16

get into the breadth matter.  That's why I ask you.  Was 

17

there something else in that hearing that the jury might 

18

have thought, oh, he didn't testify about it? 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

He's trying to help you, 

counsel. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

He's got the point.  But 

22

you have to answer, in terms of what the facts are at 

23

the hearing. 

24
25

 MR. KOMP: 

In this  in this  pardon me. 

In this circumstance, what  the facts that were going

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on in this hearing, the  that instruction could go to, 

2

again, holding his  his silence as to how  and 

3

offering  failure  failing to offer an explanation 

4

and respond 

5
6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
remorse at issue? 

7

 MR. KOMP: 

8

by Mr. Woodall. 

9

What about remorse?  Wasn't 

Remorse wasn't put at issue by 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, whatever.  I mean, 

10

the jury doesn't have to take that into account.  Isn't 

11

it one of  one of the factors? 

12

 MR. KOMP: 

It  it can be a factor, but it 

13

can't  this  the lack of remorse as the nonstatutory 

14

aggravator cannot be premised upon his silence. 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16

issue at the hearing? 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

 MR. KOMP: 

19

But was his remorse an 

Right. 
Yes, his lack of remorse.  Yes, I 

think so. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MR. KOMP: 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Then the answer 
Yes. 
I'm sorry.  So how was it an 

23

issue at the hearing?  Because that would seem to cut 

24

against you very strongly, Mr. Komp.  If remorse is an 

25

issue at the hearing, remorse is the very thing that, in

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mitchell, we said we have not decided.  And then you 

2

have no clearly established law to rely on. 

3

 And I appreciate that this was before 

4

Mitchell, rather than after Mitchell; but it suggests 

5

that there was always a question about whether Estelle 

6

applied to remorse. 

7

 MR. KOMP: 

Estelle dealt with that in the 

8

capital context.  Again, the  the distinction that 

9

we're drawing from Mitchell is that  that Mitchell did 

10

not modify Estelle.  It expanded Estelle into a Federal 

11

sentencing or other criminal case  cases.  It did not 

12

touch  it remained intact the prohibition of  of 

13

using silence. 

14

 Again, Estelle dealt with silence, and 

15

silence that was used to support a lack of remorse, 

16

which was used to support the 

17
18
19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry.  It left 

in  Estelle left intact what? 
 MR. KOMP: 

I'm  pardon me.  Mitchell left 

20

intact Estelle's application at the capital sentencing 

21

proceeding. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose we read Estelle as 

23

saying that, on the issue of remorse, it is an open 

24

question whether or not the selfincrimination privilege 

25

is applicable.  Suppose we read it that way.  And

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

suppose we think that, in your case, remorse was an 

2

issue at the penalty phase.  Does that not mean that 

3

this issue was not clearly decided?  That's  it has a 

4

bearing on this case? 

5
6
7

 MS. KOMP: 

Could you  could you please 

repeat the  the first part?  I 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose we read Mitchell 

8

as saying that on the  where remorse is at issue, it 

9

is not settled whether or not there is a Fifth Amendment 

10

selfincrimination right; and it is not settled that the 

11

defendant is entitled to an instruction about silence, 

12

number one. 

13

 Number two, suppose we think, as I think to 

14

be the case, that remorse was an issue in this trial in 

15

the penalty phase.  Does that not mean that the rule is 

16

unclear and you're not clearly entitled to an 

17

instruction on that issue? 

18

 MR. KOMP: 

I  I disagree because these 

19

these capital sentencing proceedings are not just about 

20

remorse or lack of remorse.  And what  what would 

21

happen in that circumstance is  is, right now, you 

22

have a bright line.  And if  if we accept remorse out 

23

of this in the capital sentencing context, there's two 

24

problems with that. 

25

 One, we would have hybrid Carter

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instructions, and there would be  we'd have to figure 

2

out, all right, which instruction would fit if we 

3

looked 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But we could 
But your  your answer is 

6

what the law should be.  My question is whether or not 

7

at least the law is not open on that point, unsettled. 

8
9

 MR. KOMP: 

I believe that Estelle settled 

this, and Mitchell did not cut back on Estelle in the 

10

capital sentencing context and that Estelle imported the 

11

noadverse instruction that's required by Carter. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It is, but you have to go 

13

beyond saying I believe that.  What you have to say to 

14

prevail here is, not only do I believe it, but no 

15

reasonable juror  no reasonable jurist could possibly 

16

believe otherwise.  Now, do you want to say that? 

17

 MR. KOMP: 

I  pardon me.  If you  if we 

18

look at Mitchell, and we look at the discussion of the 

19

noadverseinference instruction 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No reasonable jurors could 

say otherwise? 
 MR. KOMP: 

One, I don't think this Court in 

23

Williams said that  that  or not  that AEDPA is 

24

not a subjective juror/judge contest.  And if you read 

25

Mitchell and it talks about this is a product of our

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

existing precedent, this is a rule of proven utility, 

2

this is an essential feature of our justice system, 

3

the  the rule was  was absolutely clear that  that 

4

these no  noadverseinferences could be raised.  And 

5

that was a  a rule of proven utility. 

6

 And all that Mitchell did in that one 

7

sentence is reserve a question that  that may or may 

8

not be applicable in Federal sentencing or noncapital 

9

sentencing.  It did not cut back on Estelle, which said 

10

for  that there is no basis to distinguish between the 

11

guilt and penalty phases of capital cases. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So  so your 

13

argument is when Mitchell said  whether it applies to 

14

lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility for the 

15

sentencing guidelines, that's a separate question.  We 

16

don't have any view on it.  But at the same time, the 

17

Court said well, of course, it applies in  in the 

18

other  other context. 

19

 MR. KOMP: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right, this Court 
But that's perfectly 

21

clear.  I mean, if you were arguing the other way, you 

22

would say, well, the question is whether it's clearly if 

23

there's a clear difference between lack of remorse in 

24

the sentencing guideline case and lack of remorse in a 

25

capital case, and everybody knew that, so that when

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mitchell just said it doesn't apply to lack of remorse 

2

in the sentencing guidelines, nobody would think that 

3

meant that there was an open issue on the capital 

4

context. 

5

 MR. KOMP: 

I  no, we would think it's an 

6

open issue because if you  if you go through the 

7

the Mitchell opinion and how it builds on the no 

8

adverse  no adverse inference and talks about Griffin 

9

and Estelle, and then the  the key language is at 

10

at 329.  "Although Estelle was a capital case, its 

11

reasoning applies with full force here." 

12
13
14

 So this was a pushing forward of Estelle. 
It wasn't a cutting back on Estelle. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How could this be 

15

let's assume that you're right, that there was error. 

16

How could it be harmful, given the  that the 

17

mitigators  that the aggravators were not in dispute, 

18

he had entered a guilty plea?  So how was the defendant 

19

harmed by the failure to give this instruction? 

20

 MR. KOMP: 

I think in two manners.  One is 

21

when you're  relates to using the right to silence as 

22

a penalty, which is the natural inclination of  of the 

23

jurors.  So they're going to hold his  his failure to 

24

testify against him.  And they'll do it twofold. 

25

They'll actually put it on the scale.  He didn't say

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that he was sorry, he didn't personally offer remorse, 

2

so we're going to consider that as not 

3
4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
that? 

5

 MR. KOMP: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7
8
9

Did the prosecutor argue 

No.  No. 
So how would they have 

put that on the scale? 
 MR. KOMP: 

Well, they  that's the natural, 

what this Court recognizes  the natural inclinations 

10

of what jurors do.  And this prosecutor  and it's laid 

11

out in our Red Brief  although he technically said, 

12

"I'm not going to argue lack of remorse, but I'm going 

13

to do everything, but that."  So that was clearly 

14

where  where he was pointing. 

15

 The other  what  the other impact it has 

16

is this was a case that there was strong mitigation. 

17

This is somebody who's borderline mentally retarded, has 

18

a personality disorder, which doesn't allow him to 

19

function in society, but there's also a strong element 

20

of Skipper evidence. 

21

 So when you're asking for a life without 

22

parole and you have expert testimony saying this 

23

individual is not going to be a danger to correction 

24

officers, and you have a jailer that testifies that he's 

25

wellmannered and wellbehaved and is not a problem at

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all, and you have the background that he has, this 

2

that's a strong mitigation narrative. 

3

 And if the defendant doesn't testify in 

4

support of that, that undermines that mitigation 

5

narrative.  So the failure to testify and the failure to 

6

offer this instruction has  has sort of two  two 

7

harms.  It 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And you think that made the 

9

difference, that the jury would not have condemned your 

10

client to death, had it not been for the fact that they 

11

drew an adverse inference from  they knew all the 

12

horrific details of the crime.  They had heard all of 

13

your mitigating evidence. 

14

 And you think what  what tipped the 

15

balance  or at least we think it plausibly could have 

16

tipped the balance, is  is this failure to give the 

17

noadverse inference instruction? 

18

 MR. KOMP: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. KOMP: 

Absolutely. 
Really? 
Absolutely.  And this Court 

21

considers the death penalty case  all death  any 

22

death penalty case has horrible facts. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

Well, what 
Mr. Komp, did the Sixth 

Circuit apply the wrong harmlessness standard here?  It

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

seemed to a apply the standard that would be applicable 

2

on direct review, rather than on habeas review; is that 

3

correct? 

4
5
6

 MR. KOMP: 

I believe that they cited Brecht, 

and they cited O'Neal appropriately. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Because it seems to rely 

7

primarily on Carter.  And Carter applies the Chapman 

8

standard, which is, of course, the direct review 

9

standard. 

10

 MR. KOMP: 

I think the reference to Carter 

11

was to talk about  we're talking about assessing the 

12

harmfulness of this error or the harmlessness of this 

13

error in the context of an instruction that wasn't 

14

given, where the instruction that's not given prevents 

15

negative inferences. 

16

 So the reference to Carter was to talk about 

17

what  what the natural inclination for the failure to 

18

give the instruction is.  It was sort of a framework of 

19

what's going on.  So I don't think it was used in that 

20

circumstance. 

21

 Where  and when they ultimately came to 

22

their conclusion, they relied, again, on citing, 

23

expressly, the O'Neal standard. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What do you think is the 

worse adverse inference they might have drawn?

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KOMP: 

In this case, I think it's 

2

it's not offering an apology, not  not saying why or 

3

not explaining how.  I think there's  there's so many 

4

things that 

5
6
7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You can finish 

your 
 MR. KOMP: 

 that a juror wants to hear 

8

naturally wants to hear.  And that's what  the basis 

9

that this Court held in Carter is this  why this 

10

instruction is appropriate. 

11

 Thank you. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

 Ms. Lenz, you have 5 minutes remaining. 

14

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN R. LENZ 

15

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

16

 MS. LENZ: 

17

 I would just like to point out, at the 

Thank you. 

18

beginning of his responsive argument, my colleague was 

19

talking about the selection factors in Estelle.  And 

20

whether they're called selection factors or whatever 

21

they're called, the prosecutor had to prove future 

22

dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt in order to 

23

render the defendant in that case death eligible. 

24
25

 There were three things that the prosecution 
had to prove, and that was one of them.  So those

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

selection factors, or whatever you want to call them, 

2

operated as aggravating circumstances for the death 

3

penalty, so I just wanted to make sure that the Court is 

4

clear on that. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6

Jurek reads to the contrary. 

7

 MS. LENZ: 

Your friend says 

No, Jurek does not read to the 

8

contrary, no.  I mean, I  perhaps he's saying that 

9

because of the reference to calling them selection 

10

factors.  When one speaks of selection factors, one 

11

usually doesn't think of deatheligibility factors. 

12

 So my only point is, regardless of 

13

nomenclature, they operated as aggravating 

14

circumstances, the prosecution has burden of proof. 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If the only criteria to 

16

determine harmlessness is the gruesome  gruesome 

17

nature of the crime, it appears to me that, in almost 

18

every deatheligible case I've come across, gruesomeness 

19

is inherent.  By your argument, there's never a case in 

20

which a defendant can prove a harmful sentencing error. 

21

 MS. LENZ: 

That's not true, Justice 

22

Sotomayor, because it would depend on what the violation 

23

is  what the error is.  I think, in this case, when 

24

you consider the absence of this prophylactic 

25

instruction in comparison with the heinousness of the

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

crimes, the guilty plea, the overwhelming evidence, his 

2

prior convictions for sexual abuse, his postcrime 

3

conduct, all of it, when you consider that together 

4
5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
very close to Wiggins. 

6

 MS. LENZ: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8
9
10

But the mitigation was 

The mitigation was? 
Was very close to the 

Wiggins case. 
 MS. LENZ: 

I'm sorry? 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The mitigation evidence 

11

offered here was very close to the Wiggins case 

12

similar mitigation. 

13

 MS. LENZ: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15
16

I think 
And there, we held there 

was harmful error. 
 MS. LENZ: 

I think the mitigation was  was 

17

negligible in comparison to  to the rest of the 

18

crimes. 

19

 And the other point that I would just like 

20

to make is that there was not clearly established law in 

21

this case, and the Kentucky Supreme Court's decision was 

22

not an error beyond any possibility for fairminded 

23

disagreement. 

24

 Thank you.
