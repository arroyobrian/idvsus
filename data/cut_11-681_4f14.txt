 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

first this morning in Case 11681, Harris v. Quinn. 
 Mr. Messenger. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

8

 MR. MESSENGER: 

9

it please the Court: 

10

We'll hear argument 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 Illinois is forcing Susan Watts and 

11

thousands of other home care providers to pay compulsory 

12

fees to the SEIU to petition the State about its 

13

Medicaid program that pays for their services to persons 

14

with disabilities, in Mrs. Watts' case, her daughter 

15

Libby. 

16

 This violates the First Amendment because 

17

the purpose of this mandatory association is inherently 

18

expressive, petition the government for a redress of 

19

grievances, otherwise, lobby.  And also because this 

20

program 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought it was to 

22

negotiate what's typically negotiated in collective 

23

bargaining; that is, wages, is that not so?  Wages and 

24

benefits? 

25

 MR. MESSENGER: 

The subjects of bargaining

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here are the reimbursement rates given to the providers, 

2

and the State now offers or pays money to the SEIU for a 

3

health benefit, but that is petitioning the government 

4

with regard to those negotiations. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But how does it differ 

6

from the typical bargaining that a union does?  It asks 

7

for a wage rate, and it asks for various benefits.  So 

8

are you saying that when it's a public  in the public 

9

sector, it gets converted into something else? 

10

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes.  When  in the public 

11

sector, when a group is petitioning the government for 

12

money, that is, petitioning the government over a public 

13

program, here from a Medicaid program, it would be very 

14

little different than if the American Medical 

15

Association was asking for higher Medicaid rates for 

16

doctors or for nurses. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Is your argument 

18

dependent on this being sort of a dual employee 

19

situation, that it's reimbursement, as opposed to 

20

policemen, fire  police people, fire people, teachers, 

21

other public  other public employees who are directly 

22

employed by the State? 

23

 MR. MESSENGER: 

That is our position for why 

24

Abood is distinguishable on that point, is that, here, 

25

the State is not the common law employer or the sole

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employer of these providers.  It simply pays them for 

2

their services, much like a health insurer pays for the 

3

services of medical professionals. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But your argument, of 

5

course, isn't limited to that.  It goes beyond that 

6

situation? 

7

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes.  And that the  the 

8

actual bargaining, even on behalf of true employees, is 

9

also petitioning and political in nature, and for that 

10
11

reason Abood should be overruled. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is there any likelihood 

12

that the union that represents these  what do I call 

13

them  healthcare workers, health providers  care 

14

providers, is there any likelihood that they would try 

15

to bargain for benefits for these  these workers? 

16

 MR. MESSENGER: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would the union attempt to? 
Yes, yes.  Is there any 

18

likelihood?  Do we know anything about what the 

19

likelihood would be for certain subjects to be brought 

20

up in the bargaining with the State? 

21

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Well, one thing that has 

22

happened, this is in the collective bargaining 

23

agreement, is the State has agreed to give certain 

24

amounts of money to an SEIU healthcare fund to offer 

25

access to health benefits for those providers.  So the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

State is funding the SEIU's health benefit program to 

2

that extent. 

3
4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Did they have that 

before the union? 

5

 MR. MESSENGER: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No. 
Suppose you have a 

7

policeman who  who is dissatisfied with his wages.  So 

8

he makes an appointment with the commissioner  police 

9

commissioner, and he goes in and grouses about his 

10

wages.  He does this  you know, 10 or 11 times. 

11

 And the commissioner finally is fed up, and 

12

he tells his secretary, I don't  I don't want to see 

13

this man again.  Has he violated the Constitution? 

14

 MR. MESSENGER: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16
17

No. 
He has prevented a petition 

for a redress of grievances? 
 MR. MESSENGER: 

No, because in that  with 

18

an individual speaking, it's, sir, a matter of private 

19

or internal proprietary matter that, under this Court's 

20

precedence, don't rise to a matter of public concern. 

21

 However, if you had an organization 

22

petitioning a  a police district for wages across the 

23

board for police officers, then that is a matter of 

24

public concern and would violate the First 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I really don't understand

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that.  When  when you  so what if it's 10 policemen 

2

who do this?  It's still not a matter of public concern? 

3

Or does it have to be the whole police force? 

4

 MR. MESSENGER: 

The line would be, once you 

5

have the collective, it would be start to become a 

6

matter of public concern.  It'd be the public 

7

concern test. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It seems to me it's always 

a matter of public concern, whether you're going to 

10

raise the salaries of policemen, whether it's an 

11

individual policeman asking for that or  or a  a 

12

combination of policemen or a union.  It's always a 

13

matter of public concern, isn't it? 

14
15
16
17
18

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Then if it is, then I submit 

that it's unconstitutional for 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  To not  not give 

this guy an appointment the 12th time. 
 MR. MESSENGER: 

No.  The police just 

19

chief can certainly shut his door, but what would be 

20

unconstitutional is to force 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, how can he shut his 

22

door if  he has a right to petition, a constitutional 

23

right to petition for the redress of grievances?  His 

24

grievance is he's not being paid enough. 

25

 MR. MESSENGER: 

But in that case, under our

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

public concern test, which goes within the Pickering 

2

line, that that individual grievance would not rise to a 

3

First Amendment petition. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But it's the same grievance 

5

if the union had presented it.  The  the grievance is 

6

the salaries for policemen are not high enough. 

7

 MR. MESSENGER: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9
10
11

But the 
He's not asking for just 

his salary to be raised.  He wants salaries of all 
all the cops to be raised. 
 MR. MESSENGER: 

Well, two points.  The first 

12

is the scale is what differentiates.  So here, you have 

13

a union petitioning a State for Medicaid rates that are 

14

paid for 20,000some care providers, and so the scale of 

15

it is what makes it a matter of public concern or a 

16

matter of lobbying, as opposed to 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But what  what you're 

18

objecting to, to the extent that you're not objecting to 

19

the entire system of collective bargaining, you're 

20

objecting  you're saying an individual employee can 

21

say, I don't feel like supporting a union that makes a 

22

certain kind of argument about wages or about benefits. 

23

 So, just to carry on with Justice Scalia's 

24

example, the subject matter is the exact same in the two 

25

contexts, whether it's an individual employee or whether

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's a union, and in both contexts, the  the ultimate 

2

sanction is the same, right?  Somebody grouses about his 

3

pay too much, he could get fired.  Somebody refuses to 

4

support a union that is negotiating about pay, he can 

5

lose his job. 

6
7

 So it's  it's really identical across the 
two situations. 

8

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Well, I'd say 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Same subject matter, same 

10
11

sanction.  What's the difference? 
 MR. MESSENGER: 

There's two  two 

12

differences.  One, again, is the scale.  When you're 

13

talking about a union collectively petitioning a school 

14

district or in the States 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But you're not objecting, I 

16

think, to the union as a whole.  What you're objecting 

17

to is an individual employee having to support that 

18

activity.  The scale is no different.  It's an 

19

individual employee. 

20

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, the  it's an 

21

individual employee being forced to support that 

22

expressive activity.  So the question becomes:  What 

23

expressive activity are they being forced to support? 

24
25

 And when you're speaking of changing an 
entire government program, for example, Medicaid rates

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

across the board, that is a matter of public concern. 

2

That is a matter of lobbying or political concerns. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But that's exactly what the 

4

individual employee in Justice Scalia's hypothetical is 

5

arguing for.  He wants wage rates to be changed across 

6

the board.  He knows they're not going to be changed 

7

just for him.  He wants higher wage rates. 

8
9

 MR. MESSENGER: 

But, again, under this 

Court's private  under the public concern test, an 

10

individual simply speaking to that usually does not rise 

11

to a matter of public concern. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, Mr. Messenger, I'm 

13

confused by this whole line of argumentation.  I didn't 

14

think there was any issue in this case about the right 

15

of the plaintiffs or any of the other affected workers 

16

to say whatever they want on their own.  That  they're 

17

not prohibited from doing that, are they? 

18

 MR. MESSENGER: 

No, they're not. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So there isn't any issue 

20

about that in the case.  I thought the issue  and they 

21

can try to  to meet with anybody they want as many 

22

times as they want.  I suppose that  that person has a 

23

perfect right to say:  Enough is enough; I don't want to 

24

meet with you for the fifth time or for the first time. 

25

 I thought the issue was whether they could

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be required to pay for somebody else to go and speak and 

2

possibly say things that they disagree with. 

3

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, exactly, that they are 

4

being forced to support an organization, here, the SEIU, 

5

to speak or petition the State over its Medicaid rates. 

6

So the distinction is 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So let's break this 

8

down.  You're not arguing that there's something wrong 

9

with a union qua union.  Is there anything wrong with 

10

the State saying, we're not going to negotiate with any 

11

employee who's not a member of the union? 

12

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, under  I'm sorry. 

13

There is  Your Honor, there is not a problem with that 

14

because my whole 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  Is there a 

16

problem for the State to say  the union, to organize, 

17

has a certain amount of costs.  So putting aside fair 

18

representation laws, could the State say, this is what 

19

we're going to pay police officers, $100, but we're 

20

going to pay union members $110 to reimburse them for the 

21

cost of negotiation.  Would that be okay? 

22

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes.  Under Knight, the 

23

State can choose who it bargains with, and if it chooses 

24

to set different rates for union and  union and 

25

nonunion, it could, as you said, notwithstanding

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

fair  or duty of fair representation 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So there's no problem 

3

here with the representation.  Your problem is with the 

4

fair share? 

5

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, forcing the individuals 

6

to support the union for the purpose of petitioning the 

7

State over here the Medicaid rates for homecare. 

8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Are there any  you 

suggest, in response to my colleague's question, that 

10

they could  the State could pay healthcare providers 

11

different rates.  Is there  are there any limitations? 

12

We're talking about Medicaid reimbursement. 

13

 MR. MESSENGER: 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
Are there any 

15

limitations that would prevent differential rates of 

16

pay, reimbursement, under Medicaid for the same 

17

services? 

18

 MR. MESSENGER: 

There may be statutory.  I 

19

know that most Medicaid programs are  across the board 

20

set rates.  But also, constitutionally, if there was a 

21

differential act or degree, it could be considered a 

22

penalty for the individual exercising their rights. 

23

 But as far as I know, most Medicaid 

24

programs, in particular the one here, it's always been a 

25

fixed rate established across the board.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Messenger, just to 

2

clarify what was the purpose of my earlier line of 

3

questioning, it was simply to show that, if you have a 

4

case, it doesn't rest on the right to petition the 

5

government for redress of grievances. 

6

 It  it rests on the First Amendment. 

7

You  you say that there is being  your  your 

8

people are being required to support speech that they 

9

don't agree with. 

10

 MR. MESSENGER: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
Now, that is  you know, 

12

that is an arguable position, but I don't  I don't 

13

think it's even arguable that the right to petition the 

14

government for redress of grievances is  is involved 

15

here. 

16

 MR. MESSENGER: 

It's the expression they're 

17

being forced to support, Your Honor.  So the violation, 

18

as you say, is they're being forced to support 

19

expressive activity and that expressive activity 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's a First Amendment 

21

violation, not a violation  not a denial of the right 

22

to petition the government. 

23

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, Your Honor.  They're 

24

not being denied the right to petition, in the sense 

25

that the State is saying they cannot petition.  Instead,

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

they're being forced to support petitioning. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

that Justice Scalia's answer satisfies his own question. 

4

 (Laughter.) 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

What  what was the 

question? 

7

 (Laughter.) 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

Mr. Messenger, I'm not sure 

Because here's the thing: 

That, in the workplace, we've given the government a 

10

very wide degree of latitude, and there's much that the 

11

government can do.  It can fire people, it can demote 

12

people for things that they say in the workplace, not 

13

for things that they say as a citizen, but for things 

14

that they say in the workplace.  That's the fundamental 

15

lesson of Garcetti and of many, many others of our 

16

cases. 

17

 So you're saying, well, the government can 

18

punish somebody for saying something, but the government 

19

in the exact same position cannot compel somebody to say 

20

something they disagree with.  And I want to know what's 

21

the basis for that distinction, which it seems to me is 

22

just as hard as  as if you were answering under the 

23

Petition Clause. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I want to hear the answer, 

too, because, contrary to what Justice Kagan suggests,

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I  I didn't say your First Amendment argument was 

2

valid. 

3

 (Laughter.) 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

Good, okay. 
I said at least it was a 

comprehensible argument. 

7

 (Laughter.) 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

Jump in whenever 

you'd like. 

10

 (Laughter.) 

11

 MR. MESSENGER: 

The way in which homecare 

12

providers petition the State, I submit, is not an 

13

internal proprietary matter that the government has free 

14

rein to manage.  And so the distinction between 

15

government acting as proprietor, as you say, the 

16

government can tell an employee on work time that you 

17

can't engage in certain speech if it interferes with the 

18

workplace. 

19

 But the way in which an individual 

20

associates with to lobby or petition the State is not an 

21

internal proprietary matter.  So for example, here, the 

22

way in which Susan Watts and other homecare providers 

23

petition the State is not internal workplace speech. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why isn't it?  I mean, it 

is for private employers.  There are some private

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employers who think they're better off with a closed 

2

shop, and they just want to deal with one union, and 

3

and they require all the people that they hire to become 

4

a member of this union and to pay union dues for 

5

representational purposes. 

6

 They do this as private employers because 

7

they think it is in their interest as an employer.  Why 

8

can't the government have the same interest? 

9

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Because when the government 

10

is involved, the First Amendment interests are much 

11

heightened because you're dealing with attempting to 

12

influence government policy. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All right.  But  but 

14

don't tell me that there's no employer interest.  There 

15

is an employer interest.  You're just saying it is 

16

not  it is not considerable enough, right? 

17
18
19

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, it's not considerable 

enough.  Here, the State lacks 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But what stops the 

20

the non  the people who oppose a union policy from 

21

sending a letter, asking a meeting, expressing their 

22

disapproval in any forum they want and in any way they 

23

want, to whatever policy a union is advocating? 

24
25

 Is there anything that stops them from doing 
that?

16

Alderson Reporting Company

3

 MR. MESSENGER: 

No, there isn't, Your Honor. 

However, I submit that it's not 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So where's the First 

4

Amendment abridgement?  They can do whatever they want. 

5

They can speak however they want in support of or in 

6

opposition to absolutely anything the union is doing. 

7

 MR. MESSENGER: 

It's  Your Honor, it's the 

8

compelled speech, and the fact that the individuals have 

9

other First Amendment rights is not exculpatory.  So 

10

it's the  it's the compulsion to support the SEIU's 

11

positions in petitioning the State.  That is the First 

12

Amendment violation. 

13

 And the fact that 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I suppose  I suppose the 

15

fact that you're entitled to speak against abortion 

16

would not justify the government in requiring you to 

17

give money to Planned Parenthood? 

18

 MR. MESSENGER: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20
21

Exactly, Your Honor. 
That's the argument you're 

making. 
 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes.  And actually, I submit 

22

that the fact that providers do remain free to petition 

23

the State only shows that the socalled "labor peace" 

24

interest hasn't been done here by Illinois because the 

25

interest there is to avoid competing demands from

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

various providers. 
 Here, the fact that each provider does, in 

3

fact, remain free to petition the State through 

4

organizations other than the SEIU shows that the State 

5

has not achieved any sort of labor peace, as the State 

6

could potentially achieve within its workplace by 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9

Mr. Messenger 
Well, but, I mean, I 

suppose there could be labor peace if the Respondents 

10

were to prevail.  I mean, that  that assumes that your 

11

theory of the case is going  is going to prevail.

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Well, no.  Even if the 

scheme here 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I mean, doesn't the 

15

isn't there labor peace  let's assume that's a valid 

16

interest  isn't there labor peace if one union 

17

represents these healthcare providers and makes and 

18

negotiates a contract with the government? 

19

 MR. MESSENGER: 

No, I submit that the labor 

20

peace interest isn't valid here because, in dealing with 

21

the Medicaid program, the State doesn't have an interest 

22

in avoiding competing demands from rival groups 

23

regarding its policies on that; That is, democratic 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, why doesn't it? 

It  it gets the demand from the union, it recognizes

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's reasonable; that's the policy, and then it can move 

2

forward with the policy. 

3

 MR. MESSENGER: 

4
5

Well, the State could 

unilaterally do that, without bargaining with the union. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Mr. Messenger, do you think 

6

the issue of exclusive representation is inextricably 

7

tied to the issue of the assessment of an agency fee? 

8

Can't you have the former without the latter? 

9

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, you can, in At least 

10

two ways.  The first of which is that Knox, of course, 

11

lays out a twopart test.  The second part test  even 

12

if the first is satisfied, that the mandatory 

13

association, here, exclusive representation, is 

14

justified by compelling interest, you still go to the 

15

second test of whether or not fees are a necessary 

16

incident to that representation, and I submit that 

17

Illinois does not satisfy that test. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you're not  you're 

19

not challenging  or it's confusing whether you are or 

20

not  the very idea of exclusive representation by a 

21

union.  Are you saying that, in the public sector, there 

22

cannot be exclusive  an exclusive bargaining agent? 

23

 MR. MESSENGER: 

It's not directly challenged 

24

in this case, but it becomes relevant under the first 

25

Knox test, which asks whether the mandatory association

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

being supported by the compulsory fees is justified by a 

2

compelling State interest. 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is the mandatory  let's 

4

take out, as Justice Alito suggested, take out the 

5

agency fee or fairshare fee or whatever it is, but 

6

there is an exclusive bargaining agent.  Workers, your 

7

clients, say, we don't want to be represented by that 

8

union. 

9

 The union is authorized to represent 

10

everybody in the workplace and has to represent even 

11

nonmembers, as well, without any discrimination.  And 

12

and are you taking the position that there cannot be an 

13

exclusive bargaining agent if there are any dissenters 

14

who don't want to be represented by a union? 

15

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Not in this case, Your 

16

Honor.  This case does not present the question of 

17

whether exclusive representation alone would constitute 

18

a First Amendment injury because the complaint here is 

19

focused towards the compulsory fees, so that particular 

20

issue is not here. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So, Mr. Messenger, even on 

22

the compulsory fees  I mean, what strikes me is that 

23

this is  I'm just going to use the word here  it is 

24

a radical argument.  It would radically restructure the 

25

way workplaces across this country are  are run.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And let me just put it to you this way and 

2

ask if you agree with this  with this statement. 

3

Since 1948, since the TaftHartley Act, there has been a 

4

debate in every State across this country about whether 

5

to be a righttowork State, and people have disagreed. 

6

 Some States say yes, some States say no. 

It 

7

raises considerable heat and passion and tension, as we 

8

recently saw in Wisconsin.  And  but  you know, 

9

these are public policy choices that States make. 

10

 And is it fair to say that what you're 

11

suggesting here  your argument is essentially to say 

12

that, for 65 years, people have been debating the wrong 

13

question when they've been debating that because, in 

14

fact, a righttowork law is constitutionally compelled? 

15

 MR. MESSENGER: 

In the public sector, yes, 

16

that it is in fact  well, the first public sector 

17

labor law was actually 1959 in Wisconsin, so it's 

18

relatively recent when you're involving with government. 

19

Yes, our position is  is that, in the public sector, 

20

when government is involved, compulsory fees are illegal 

21

under the First Amendment. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose the Court were to 

23

say that on the issue of salaries there is no First 

24

Amendment violation, that  that Abood should remain 

25

applicable to public employee unions.

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Are there other issues that public employee 

2

unions necessarily raise in collective bargaining that 

3

raise other concerns about governmental policies that 

4

union members might disagree with? 

5

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, Your Honor.  Speaking 

6

of true employees  we're not speaking of Medicaid 

7

providers, but speaking of true employees, this was 

8

discussed in Abood with respect to public school 

9

teachers and all the different aspects that the union 

10

petitions over that has to do with class sizes, hours 

11

worked. 

12

 Benefits are a huge issue, of course, in 

13

terms of financially for many school districts, health 

14

benefits.  So there are many issues of the way the 

15

school district actually operates. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How about here for your 

17

employees?  They negotiate health insurance.  Do they 

18

they don't negotiate termination because that's up to 

19

the individual 

20

 MR. MESSENGER: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  parties. 

Yes. 
So there's 

22

no grievance committee.  Do they negotiate the tasks 

23

that will be reimbursed? 

24

 MR. MESSENGER: 

25

No.  The tasks that the 

State will reimburse are set in a service plan.  That's

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

not a mandatory 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  So you're 

3

being asked to have a fair share of how much you're 

4

getting from the State for your services and health 

5

insurance.  What else is negotiated that you're being 

6

asked to pay for? 

7

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Well, what  as far as what 

8

they're being forced to support is the reimbursement 

9

rate.  The State is giving money to an SEIU healthcare 

10

fund, which many providers may or may not use.  The 

11

State is giving money to an SEIU member training fund to 

12

provide voluntary training to providers and also to 

13

conduct an orientation that new providers will be forced 

14

to support. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Those things, you can 

16

argue, are not part of the representation for which they 

17

should be charged, and they should get their money back 

18

for those things, if they're actually not  not getting 

19

any benefit from them. 

20

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Well, I would submit that 

21

they shouldn't be forced to pay for any of this 

22

petitioning regarding how the State chooses to run this 

23

Medicaid program. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, but they're  I mean, 

what our cases say is you  you can be compelled not to

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be a free rider, to  to pay for those items of 

2

bargaining that benefit you, as well as everybody else. 

3

 But you don't  you don't have to pay for 

4

stuff that  that is not within that description, stuff 

5

that doesn't benefit you at all. 

6

 MR. MESSENGER: 

That's true for true 

7

employees, under this Court's previous cases, but the 

8

question, of course, here is do those same principles 

9

apply to Medicaid providers or anyone else who receives 

10
11

money from government.  And that's 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

They receive a salary 

12

I mean, they receive  it's not a government grant to 

13

the  to the healthcare worker.  They receive a 

14

paycheck, and the government withholds from that.  The 

15

government makes a FICA contribution for them and 

16

withholds the part that's their responsibility. 

17

 So it looks just like they are an employee 

18

of the government, being paid by the government, and the 

19

government doing things that an employer does, withhold 

20

income tax, pay in part the FICA tax, withhold the other 

21

part.  And they are  they're also covered by workers' 

22

compensation, aren't they? 

23
24
25

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Oh, yes.  Under Illinois 

law, they have 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

As  as employees of the

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

State? 
 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, Your Honor.  But the 

3

wage  in fact, defining whether it's wages or a flat 

4

reimbursement rate or a grant I don't  I submit is not 

5

constitutionally relevant.  So, for example, the Act was 

6

recently extended to independent nurses and therapists 

7

who provide inhome care. 

8
9

 They're paid a flat rate, as opposed to an 
hourly  what do you call it, wage.  Constitutionally, 

10

there's no difference.  The bottom line is it's money 

11

from government, from, here, a Medicaid program, to 

12

provide care to other individuals. 

13

 And I submit that doesn't create an 

14

employment relationship any more than a doctor is 

15

privately employed by a health insurer  insurance 

16

company, merely because they pay for it. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

They're not getting a 

18

paycheck and the insurance  insurer is not deducting 

19

withholding tax  isn't paying FICA tax? 

20

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Well  that is paid, but 

21

the State is doing it as pay agent.  And so while the 

22

money is coming from the State, the State is doing it as 

23

pay agent for the person with disabilities, who is truly 

24

the employer. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I thought the State took the

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position that these individuals are State employees for 

2

one purpose only, collective bargaining.  Isn't that 

3

their position? 

4

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes, that's right in the 

5

statute, Your Honor, that's it's solely for purposes of 

6

collective bargaining. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So if one of these 

8

individuals commits gross misconduct, causes the death 

9

of a patient, the State has no liability? 

10

 MR. MESSENGER: 

It's right in the statute. 

11

The State said it's not  does not extend vicarious 

12

liability to independent providers. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

When you come back, I'd 

14

appreciate your thinking about this, but obviously, 

15

you're asking us to overturn a case that's been the law 

16

for 35 years. 

17

 I count hundreds of citations in the 

18

opinion, and I guess there are millions of instances in 

19

which employees and employers and others have relied on 

20

it in collective bargaining, so I'd appreciate your 

21

saying sentence a or two of why we should upset 

22

reasonable expectations over so long a period of time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

Thank you, counsel. 

5

 MR. SMITH: 

6

 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 

7

9

Thank you, Your Honor. 

Court: 
 10 years ago, the State of Illinois made a 
decision about the best way to deliver homecare services 

10

to thousands of persons with physical disabilities in 

11

the State who, without those services, would need to 

12

live in institutional settings. 

13

 It made the judgment that working with the 

14

union to negotiate and implement a collective bargaining 

15

agreement for these workers that it was paying would 

16

help meet its service delivery goals for this 

17

population, this group of workers, which was 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why?  If  your  your 

19

adversary says that the reimbursement rate is set by the 

20

Medicaid program, so why do you need a union to tell you 

21

how much to pay, if it's already set? 

22

 MR. SMITH: 

There is no reimbursement rate 

23

for these workers set by the Medicaid program, Your 

24

Honor.  The amount of money they are paid is an hourly 

25

wage set in the collectively bargaining agreement.  When

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the union was first recognized, it was $7 an hour and 

2

there were no benefits. 

3

 Because the State has chosen to work with 

4

this union, it has produced a package of benefits 

5

designed to create a solution to the morale problems, 

6

the recruitment problems, the retention problems 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand what 

8

you're saying.  If there were no union, there would be 

9

no wages? 

10

 MR. SMITH: 

Your Honor, the  the State's 

11

judgment is that it can better make these determinations 

12

in partnership with the union and that the process of 

13

negotiation gives it both tangible and intangible 

14

benefits.  The tangible benefit is it figures out what 

15

the priority needs of the workers are. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So from  from the outset, 

17

it set up the union, right, and the union said, We want 

18

7 bucks an hour, was that it? 

19

 MR. SMITH: 

The 7 bucks an hour was what 

20

they were getting paid before the union was on the 

21

scene, Your Honor, and the State 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. SMITH: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

 MR. SMITH: 

And who picked that number? 
The State did. 
The State did.  Okay. 
And  and it gave the workers

28

Alderson Reporting Company

the opportunity, as it has every right to do, to have a 

2

majority of the people in the workforce say, we'd like 

3

to be represented  we'd like to have somebody in the 

4

room representing us. 

5

 And, as a result, they not only have 

6

substantially increased the wages, but they have paid 

7

healthcare, they have paid training and orientation. 

8

There's a grievance system, which is extremely 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I thought Medicaid 

10

had something to do with how much they were reimbursed. 

11

You're saying Medicaid is beside the point? 

12

 MR. SMITH: 

Your Honor, in this kind of 

13

thing, we're talking about the wages of basic care 

14

workers like, if they were in a nursing home or in a 

15

State hospital or wherever they might be.  The fact that 

16

Medicaid 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If you hire a 

18

homecare provider to provide homecare services, isn't 

19

how much the person is compensated  you have a 

20

Medicaid program, a cooperative program with the Federal 

21

Government, doesn't it set the rates with which those 

22

services are reimbursed? 

23

 MR. SMITH: 

The wages for these kinds of 

24

workers are set by the State under the Medicaid program. 

25

They're not set by the Federal Government, Your Honor.

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, right, that 

2

it's a cooperative State/Federal program.  But isn't 

3

there  are you saying the wages have nothing to do 

4

with how much the  the Medicaid reimbursement for 

5

these types of services? 

6

 MR. SMITH: 

Your Honor, the  these are 

7

people being employed by the State with money that 

8

happens to come from the Medicaid program in order 

9

it's a Federal project to get people out of nursing 

10

homes into their homes, and so they let the State divert 

11

money over to pay for these people to be in the home. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But they don't just 

13

give you a bunch of money and say, Well, here it is, you 

14

figure out how much you want to  I mean, I thought 

15

this case had something to do with the fact that 

16

Medicaid was used to reimburse these employees, and 

17

you're saying it has nothing to do with that at all? 

18

 MR. SMITH: 

Your Honor, as I understand the 

19

constitutional challenge in this case, the source of the 

20

money  the State's decision about 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I just want to 

22

know  not what their challenge is.  I want to know 

23

where the money comes from.  It comes from Medicaid, and 

24

I assume Medicaid sets some parameters about how much 

25

you can reimburse homecare providers.

30

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. SMITH: 

I'm not aware of any, Your

So you can negotiate

whatever rates you want with the homecare providers,

regardless of what Medicaid says about those services?

 MR. SMITH: 

"You," the State of Illinois, 

you mean? 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

 MR. SMITH: 

Yes, yes. 

The State of Illinois, Your 

10

Honor, as far as I know  I'm not aware of any 

11

limitation.  I expect that there may be some at some 

12

point, but in terms of the 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Smith, I think that 

14

there's  I must say that I might have labored under 

15

it.  From your adversary's statement, it appears as if 

16

there's a belief that the Federal Government sets a 

17

fixed amount, and that's what the State has to pay. 

18

 Whether the Federal Government pays you a 

19

certain amount, however, you seem to be saying the State 

20

can go above that amount if it chooses.  That's the 

21

cooperative nature of this. 

22

 MR. SMITH: 

Your Honor, the exact nature of 

23

the fund transfer from the Federal government to the 

24

State may well be based on an individual's annual costs 

25

with a particular diagnosis.  I'm in the realm of

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

speculation here, but it's very clear from this record 

2

that these decisions about how these individuals will be 

3

paid are made by the State, and that they have the 

4

discretion under the program to do that, and that they 

5

decided that they would deal with the problems of 

6

recruitment and retention and morale in this workforce, 

7

which is, of course, scattered to tens of thousands of 

8

work sites across the country. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Mr. Smith, what I don't 

10

understand is why the union's participation in this is 

11

essential.  The State can say, this is how much these 

12

people are being paid  it's not enough, we want to 

13

increase it, we want to increase it by 10 percent, 20 

14

percent, 30 percent, whatever it is.  They need some 

15

they should have extra benefits.  Well, we'll give them 

16

these benefits and these benefits and these benefits. 

17
18
19

 Why do they need to have the union intervene 
here? 
 MR. SMITH: 

The State of Illinois, like many 

20

employers, decided that, A, they would get that right 

21

more likely if they were dealing with a representative 

22

of the workers who told them what they care about, 

23

whether it's paid vacation versus higher wages versus 

24

less hours during the week or more hours during the week 

25

or whatever it might be.

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 It also said that, because these decisions 

2

are going to be made in the process of negotiation, 

3

which the workers know they have a place at the table, 

4

somebody who was there looking out for their interests, 

5

the workers will have a different sense of commitment 

6

to 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that  that's fine 

8

for the workers who want the union to represent them in 

9

making these demands on the State. 

10

 Let me give you this example, which I think 

11

gets to what the  the plaintiffs in this case find 

12

disturbing.  Let's say this is  this involves a 

13

teachers union.  So the teachers union is negotiating 

14

about the issue of tenure and merit pay, and the union 

15

is opposed to any change in the tenure system, it's 

16

opposed to merit pay. 

17

 Okay. 

Now, there's a teacher who's not a 

18

member of the union who disagrees completely with the 

19

union on these issues, but this teacher  and the 

20

teacher is not a member of the union, but still has to 

21

pay a pretty hefty agency fee, maybe $700 a year.  So 

22

the teacher is paying this money to the union to make an 

23

argument to the employer with which the teacher 

24

completely disagrees. 

25

 Now, if this teacher just wants to get back

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to a neutral position, the teacher is going to have to 

2

spend $700 or maybe $500 of his or her own money, pay 

3

that to another organization that will present that 

4

teacher's point of view to the employer. 

5

 How can that be  what would you say to 

6

that, to that teacher?  That  you know, You have a 

7

right to be  you have a right to say whatever you want 

8

on these issues, but you don't have a right to be a 

9

teacher? 

10

 MR. SMITH: 

Well, Your Honor, I would say 

11

that the Court has correctly held, over a period of more 

12

than 30 years, that that requirement is an appropriate 

13

thing which a public employer is allowed to impose 

14

because of the duty of fair representation and because 

15

of the benefits of allowing collective bargaining to 

16

proceed with the duty of fair representation imposed on 

17

the union. 

18

 As Justice Scalia put it in his Lehnert 

19

opinion, this is not a normal sort of free rider 

20

argument.  This is a free  free rider argument where 

21

the law requires the union to look after that teacher 

22

and make sure that they get treated equally 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Mr. Smith, are you saying 

24

that this  that the unions reluctantly accept the duty 

25

of being the exclusive representative for all the

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employees?  They don't really want to do this, but the 

2

law requires them to do this, but because the law 

3

requires them to do this, then they have to get this 

4

agency fee? 

5
6
7

 Is that really  is that realistically what 
happens? 
 MR. SMITH: 

Well, that is  that is the 

8

system we have, Your Honor.  And imagine what the world 

9

would look like if there weren't 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Seriously, the unions do not 

11

want to have the  they don't want to be given the 

12

status of the exclusive bargaining agent for the 

13

employees? 

14

 MR. SMITH: 

I  I think there may be 

15

variation on that.  I imagine there might be some union 

16

out there that would love to be able to favor their 

17

members over other.  But the law doesn't require that, 

18

and for a very good reason, including the First 

19

Amendment reason. 

20

 Imagine a world in which that teacher is 

21

would be paid 10 percent less as we were discussing 

22

before, because that teacher has chosen not to be a full 

23

member of the union, and imagine the pressure on 

24

associational rights that would be created for that 

25

teacher faced with that choice.

35

 You could be paid 10 percent less doing the 

2

same work, or you can be paid the same as everybody 

3

else, but you have to fully join the union and pay for 

4

their political speech and pay for everything on the 

5

nonchargeable side of the line. 

6

 And  you know, what this Court has done 

7

over the last 30 years is use that distinction between 

8

chargeable and nonchargeable items to balance the First 

9

Amendment interests of the 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But in talking about First 

11

Amendment interests, let me ask you this:  Is it not a 

12

standard issue in collective bargaining for the 

13

employees' union to talk about the size of the 

14

workforce? 

15

 MR. SMITH: 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

17
18
19
20

Your Honor 
Well, it's necessarily so 

if they're talking about hours. 
 MR. SMITH: 

It is  it is certainly 

possible that in some situations 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

All right.  And would you 

21

think that this is a legitimate subject of collective 

22

bargaining for which the nonunion member has to pay? 

23

 MR. SMITH: 

It is certainly not a subject of 

24

collective bargaining that could arise in this 

25

situation.  This situation 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, I'm talking about 

2

let's say the teachers' union.  They're talking about 

3

classroom size.  They're talking about hours.  That 

4

necessarily involves the size of the workforce, does it 

5

not. 

6

 MR. SMITH: 

It  it is possibly, Your 

7

Honor.  It's entirely up 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9
10

12

It's not only possible; 

it's necessarily true.  Let's assume that it's true. 
 MR. SMITH: 

Assuming  assuming a school 

district decides to let 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Let's  let's assume that 

13

it's true, that a union's position necessarily affects 

14

the size of government.  Is not the size of government a 

15

question on which there are fundamental political 

16

beliefs  fundamental convictions that are being 

17

sacrificed if a nonunion member objects to this line of 

18

policy? 

19

 Are there not other union proposals that 

20

say  that State employee's salary must be a certain 

21

percentage of the total  total State expenditure? 

22

Does this not also involve the size of government, which 

23

is a fundamental issue of political belief? 

24
25

 MR. SMITH: 

Any outcome of a negotiation of 

a collective bargaining agreement involving public

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employees will involve the expenditure of public money 

2

in a variety of ways, and the outcome of that will, in 

3

that limited sense, at least, be a matter of public 

4

concern every bit as much and  but no more than when a 

5

government contractor 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I'm not talking about a 

7

question of public concern.  I'm talking about whether 

8

or not a union can take money from an employee who 

9

objects to the union's position on fundamental political 

10
11

grounds. 
 MR. SMITH: 

Well, Your Honor, that is what 

12

the Abood distinction between chargeable and 

13

nonchargeable 

14
15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And I'm  I'm asking the 

justification for that under the First Amendment. 

16

 MR. SMITH: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Right.  And 
In  in an era where 

18

government is getting bigger and bigger, and this is 

19

becoming more and more of an important issue to more 

20

people. 

21

 MR. SMITH: 

But I think it's important to 

22

understand that, while there is an impingement on the 

23

First Amendment interest on any employer  employee 

24

required to pay the fair share fee, this isn't any 

25

the government employee context in which the government

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has the ability when it serves its important interest as 

2

employer to demand that its employees 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, you say it's a fair 

4

share, but that's the issue in the case if you're 

5

looking at the legitimacy of Abood. 

6
7
8
9
10

 MR. SMITH: 

Well, Your Honor, look at 

look at 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I mean, you say it's fair 

share.  The objectors to Abood say that it isn't. 
 MR. SMITH: 

Look at what the union is 

11

what the  what the money is being spent on in this 

12

case.  It's being spent on negotiating the contract, which 

13

has produced a package of benefits and wage increases 

14

that have been extremely important to everybody in  in 

15

this workforce. 

16

 It's being spent on a call center that 

17

allows people to call to their union and get answers to 

18

questions about problems, a grievance system that makes 

19

sure their paychecks don't go missing and helps them 

20

address that problem, training, gloves that they need 

21

for their personal safety in the workplace, and 

22

healthcare benefits. 

23

 Now, there are  may be people who think 

24

it's politically controversial to have to contribute to 

25

a union that does those things and nothing else.  But I

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

submit to you that balance that against the interests of 

2

the State as employer in saying we want to have this 

3

partnership with this union, this will help us do a 

4

better job delivering services to this vulnerable 

5

population and save us a lot of money keeping the 

6

matter 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

One thing, 

8

Mr. Smith, the first word in your brief is "Medicaid." 

9

I don't understand because the argument can be made that 

10

Medicaid reimbursement rates is an important public 

11

policy issue, not simply a labor issue. 

12

 Now, let's say you have a teachers' union, 

13

okay?  They think it's a very important public issue. 

14

They have a platform.  They engage in activities to get 

15

higher Medicaid reimbursement rates.  Is that something 

16

that a nonunion member would have to pay for, or would 

17

they  would that expense be segregated out of what 

18

they must pay? 

19
20
21
22

 MR. SMITH: 

I'm sorry, Your Honor.  Could I 

just hear the question one more time? 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
union, okay? 

23

 MR. SMITH: 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

Teacher  teacher 

Yes, sir. 
They have a 

political position on Medicaid rates.  They spend money

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to advance that position.  If you're a teacher, but 

2

you're not a member of the union, do you have to pay for 

3

that expenditure? 

4

 MR. SMITH: 

It would seem to me, Your Honor, 

5

something that's not within the chargeable expenses that 

6

a teachers' union could charge 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8
9
10

Right.  Same  same 

public  same expenses for Medicaid 
 MR. SMITH: 

Yes. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 but you're a 

11

homecare provider.  Your union spends to get higher 

12

Medicaid rates.  You're not a member of the union.  Do 

13

you have to pay for their political activity to raise 

14

Medicaid rates? 

15

 MR. SMITH: 

To the extent that you're 

16

talking about the negotiation over how much you're going 

17

to be paid for providing services, I think it's 

18

perfectly appropriate under the Court's cases to 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So one  I'm sorry. 

20

If I could just finish the thought.  So the same speech 

21

with respect to one union is a speech on a matter of 

22

public concern, but with respect to another union, it's 

23

not? 

24
25

 MR. SMITH: 

It's on the chargeable side of 

the line when it has to do with the  the terms and

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

conditions of employment of the  of the members of the 

2

union or the nonmembers of the union. 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay.  So it's 

4

Medicaid.  Now, is that part of the chargeable expenses 

5

or not?  This union wants to talk about Medicaid 

6

reimbursement rates.  Can a nonunion member be compelled 

7

to share that expense? 

8
9
10
11

 MR. SMITH: 

If what you mean by Medicaid 

reimbursement rates, Mr. Chief Justice, is the hourly 
rate that's going to be paid to those people 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I mean Medicaid 

12

reimbursement rates.  That's what I mean by Medicaid 

13

reimbursement rates. 

14

 MR. SMITH: 

Well, if that's what you mean, 

15

then it seems to me very clear that they should be 

16

allowed to charge the  the nonmember because that 

17

person is going to get all the benefit of it. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So in this case 

19

in this case, if this union negotiates over Medicaid 

20

reimbursement rates, it is chargeable. 

21
22
23

 MR. SMITH: 

Yes, Your Honor, to the 

extent 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Even though, what I 

24

understood your answer to be, is that Medicaid 

25

reimbursement rates had nothing to do with this case.

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SMITH: 

The only thing that can be 

2

negotiated about in this case, Your Honor, is the terms 

3

and conditions of employment of these workers that is 

4

within the control of the State.  That's what the 

5

Illinois statute says.  And 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8
9

What about the issue of 
And that includes 

Medicaid reimbursement rates. 
 MR. SMITH: 

In the  in the limited sense 

10

that they're hourly wages going to these individuals, 

11

yes. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The question you're being 

13

asked, I think, is a broader question.  Collective 

14

bargaining with any employer, meat packers, hours, 

15

safety depends on hours, always can involve public 

16

interest questions. 

17

 MR. SMITH: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
But I think the question 

19

you're being asked is where you have SEIU or AFSCME, and 

20

they're government unions, does it have a bigger mix of 

21

public policy issues; and therefore, should this Court 

22

get into the business  I'm putting it in a little 

23

loaded way because I don't want to suggest the answer. 

24

 Should this Court make that distinction and 

25

get into the business of saying, when the union is too

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

much of a  wages, hours, and working conditions are 

2

too likely to affect public issues, and the other ones 

3

less likely, et cetera, you see the distinction that the 

4

question that was added suggests? 

5

 Now, I would like you to think about 

6

that's a philosophical question  or a very broad First 

7

Amendment question.  And I'd like to hear what your 

8

answer is and the government's. 

9

 MR. SMITH: 

My answer, Your Honor, would be 

10

that the fact that it is a public employee union, 

11

representing public employees, means that, in one sense, 

12

everything that is being negotiated could be viewed as a 

13

greater matter of public concern. 

14

 On the other hand, that is not a reason, as 

15

Abood held, to up the ante in terms of constitutional 

16

scrutiny.  To the contrary, this is the government as 

17

employer dealing with its employees about the basic 

18

terms and conditions of their employment.  And 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me ask you a 

20

question about pensions.  Now, that's a very big public 

21

policy issue.  I think, in Illinois, the legislature 

22

recently cut pensions of  of public employees.  That 

23

would be a subject  that could be a subject of  of 

24

collective bargaining, right?  So that would be 

25

bargaining on that would be chargeable?

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SMITH: 

It would be a subject if the 

2

State chose to let  let it become a subject.  The 

3

State completely controls what  what can be a subject 

4

of collective bargaining and what can't. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if the  if the union 

6

spends a lot of money trying to bargain on that issue, 

7

that's  that's a chargeable expense, is it not? 

8
9
10

 MR. SMITH: 

If the State has chosen to make 

it part of the contract that can be negotiated, yes. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  Now, what do you 

11

say to the young employee who is not very much concerned 

12

at this point about pensions, but realizes there's a 

13

certain pot of money, and it's either going to go for 

14

pensions, or it's going to go for salary at the present 

15

time. 

16

 So that employee who's not a member of the 

17

union has to pay for the union to bargain with the 

18

the State to achieve something that's contrary to that 

19

person's interest.  But you say that person is a free 

20

rider. 

21

 MR. SMITH: 

Yes, Your Honor.  That  that 

22

person, if it's not paying their share of that, then you 

23

have two things that happened.  The other members  the 

24

other people in the workforce have to pay more to 

25

support the process, or the union doesn't have the

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

resources needed to be a  an adequate partner with the 

2

State in producing the outcome that the State has chosen 

3

to try to seek, which is an outcome where the mutually 

4

beneficial arrangements are made that satisfy the 

5

priorities of everybody here, the workers and the State 

6

and, indeed, the clients that they serve. 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose the young person 

8

thinks that the State is squandering his heritage on 

9

unnecessary and excessive payments for benefits and 

10

wages.  Is that not a political belief of the highest 

11

order?  And  you know, we talk about free riders, 

12

which is an epithetical phrase. 

13

 Maybe the objecting employee would say that 

14

the union is a speech distorter; it is taking views that 

15

are not his and making them mandatory subject to 

16

bargaining and charging him for it. 

17

 MR. SMITH: 

What's missing, I think, in this 

18

conversation, Your Honor, is that all of these burdens 

19

on people's associational rights or free speech rights 

20

or whatever you want to call them arises only because 

21

somebody has chosen to come take this job working for 

22

the State on the terms the State offers. 

23

 And as you've said many times 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

So your position is that 

the public employees must surrender a substantial amount

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

of First Amendment rights to work for the government? 
 MR. SMITH: 

When there are substantial 

3

interests of the government as employer that are served 

4

by the sacrifice.  What you've said over and over in 

5

Duryea, in Garcetti, and in a whole line of cases is the 

6

government gets to have leeway as an employer when there 

7

are real interests at stake, and that, in that 

8

situation, the employee could be put to the choice. 

9

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 General. 

Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

13

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

14
15
16
17

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 
 The line drawn in Abood is sound. 

It has 

18

the force of stare decisis behind it, it is completely 

19

consistent with this Court's First Amendment 

20

jurisprudence, and it requires affirmance. 

21

 If I could, I'd like to turn to the 

22

questions that Justice Kennedy has raised because I do 

23

think it gets to the key issue in the case.  I think the 

24

key point  the key takeaway in this case is that the 

25

context we are dealing with here is the government as

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

proprietor and manager of its own operations.  And this 

2

Court's case law has said, over and over again, that in 

3

that context, two things follow. 

4

 First, the government's interest in the 

5

effective and efficient carrying out of its own 

6

operations is entitled to very substantial weight, more 

7

substantial weight than it would get if you were looking 

8

at the government as a sovereign regulating the 

9

citizenry. 

10

 And second, yes, Justice Kennedy, indeed, as 

11

Your Honors' opinion in Garcetti and Your Honors' 

12

opinion in Borough of Duryea recognized both times, the 

13

employees' First Amendment interests are diminished to 

14

the extent that the government has more latitude when 

15

the government can show that the obligation it is 

16

imposing is in furtherance of the government's 

17

legitimate interests as manager of its own operations. 

18
19
20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

General Verrilli, 

does Medicaid have anything to do with this case? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes.  Let me do my best 

21

to try to clear that up, Mr. Chief Justice.  I'm going 

22

to give you the best answer I can to your question. 

23

Remember, Medicaid, of course, is a joint Federal/State 

24

program.  The Federal government provides funds; the 

25

State provides funds.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Here, we're operating within a waiver 

2

program in which the State is given considerable 

3

latitude to set wages and set rates, so long as it is 

4

saving money as compared to the institutionalization of 

5

this population. 

6

 My understanding is that HHS will review 

7

wage rates set to make sure that they meet very general 

8

parameters.  They were of the kind described in the 

9

Douglas case that was before the Court a couple of years 

10

ago. 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Right, right. 
That  are they high 

13

enough to make sure the services providing  they're 

14

provided effectively and are they  and are they 

15

constrained enough that you're not wasting money

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right.  Your 

17

statement of interest  your statement of interest 

18

explaining why you are here today discusses the effect 

19

of the Medicaid program. 

20

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Right, but it's not that 

21

the  but the Federal government isn't approving the 

22

specific hourly wage rate as Medicaid reimbursement 

23

within this program.  That's a judgment that the 

24

Medicaid program leaves to the considerable discretion 

25

of the State.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If the  if the 

2

union wants to talk about Medicaid rates with the State 

3

because they would get a higher wage or could get a 

4

higher wage if Medicaid reimbursement was higher, is 

5

that within the  their functioning as a union rather 

6

than a political group? 

7

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Not as I understand it. 

8

I think applying the line of Lehnert, that that would be 

9

on the impermissible side of the line.  That would be 

10

effectively seeking to change public policy by changing 

11

what the legislature or the 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Oh, so if the union 

13

wants to say, Look, the only way our people are going to 

14

get higher wages is if there's a higher Medicaid 

15

reimbursement rate for this service, that is not within 

16

the scope of collective bargaining? 

17

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think  my 

18

understanding is that that would be  the question 

19

there was at which side of the line that the Court drew 

20

in Lehnert is that on. 

21

 I think that's probably on the  on the 

22

impermissible side of the line.  But that's where the 

23

fight would be.  It would be over where that line should 

24

be drawn, not over whether the  whether the State, as 

25

manager of its own operations, can use collective

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bargaining with a fair share, as Justice Scalia 

2

mentioned earlier, in a way that private employers 

3

routinely do. 

4

 I mean, I do think that's the fundamental 

5

point of Abood, that private  that the government as 

6

employer, as manager of its own operations, ought to be 

7

able to make the same kind of choice that private 

8

employers make when they think it advances their 

9

interests in efficiency and sound operations. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If the plaintiffs in this 

11

case worked in a unionized  excuse me  in a unionized 

12

Federal workplace, would they be assessed a mandatory 

13

agency fee? 

14

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, they would not, 

15

Justice Alito, and we're not  we're not here making an 

16

argument that, as a matter of policy, States ought to 

17

adopt fair share or not.  The thing that matters to us 

18

is the principle of First Amendment law that's at stake. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So the Federal government 

20

doesn't think that it needs to assess a mandatory agency 

21

fee from, let's say, the  the employees in the Border 

22

Patrol, in order to make sure that the Border Patrol has 

23

high morale, sufficient salary, sufficient benefits, it 

24

can do without the agency fee in that situation? 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

It hasn't, but the key

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

point for us, the point of vital importance for the 

2

United States here, is that the Court continue to 

3

recognize the context  the First Amendment context of 

4

the government as manager of its own operations.  And 

5

whatever choice the United States has made, many States 

6

have made different choices in their role as manager of 

7

their own operations. 

8

 And under the Court's established case law, 

9

which Abood, I think, is a quite good example of, the 

10

principle that, when the government is acting to further 

11

its operations as manager, they get substantial 

12

latitude.  Now, there's a limit on that, of course. 

13

They can't use that authority to  they can't leverage 

14

that authority to affect the way citizens interact as 

15

citizens 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course, one can be 

17

skeptical about whether  when States do this, they are 

18

doing it because it's more  more efficient as an 

19

employer because some States have tried to force private 

20

employers to have a closed shop, haven't they? 

21

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I think 
And there's no  you know, 

23

no State government interest in it.  There's just State 

24

interest in unions. 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes, but, here, we

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

argue 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And unions getting a lot of 

3

money from people who don't belong in the unions.  So 

4

one can be skeptical about whether this is really what's 

5

going on, that the State really thinks it's going to be 

6

a lot easier if it has a closed shop. 

7

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I guess what I would say 

8

about that, Justice Scalia, is that one could speculate 

9

about motives of States like Illinois, one could 

10

speculate about motives of the righttowork States, but 

11

I would suggest that, under our Federal system, that 

12

States get to make those kinds of policy choices. 

13

 And Illinois has made a policy choice, as 

14

many private employers have, that using collective 

15

bargaining  and it is, I want to stress here, very 

16

narrowly tailored collective bargaining.  By law, it can 

17

only be over wages, hours, and conditions of employment, 

18

by law. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you think that the 

20

specific factual background of what occurred here 

21

provides a basis for skepticism about Illinois' reason 

22

for adopting this? 

23

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I don't think so.  When 

24

the legislation was enacted, it was enacted with a very 

25

large bipartisan margin, and I just don't think it would

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be appropriate, in the context of the government as 

2

manager of its own operations, to look behind and try to 

3

consider motive. 

4

 This is a choice that many 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I thought the situation was 

6

that Governor Blagojevich got a huge campaign 

7

contribution from the union and virtually, as soon as he 

8

got into office, he took out his pen and signed an 

9

executive order that had the effect of putting  what 

10

was it, $3.6 million into the union coffers? 

11

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

13
14

Whatever happened 
That's the sequence; isn't 

that correct? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I think the issue 

15

before the Court is the constitutionality of the statute 

16

that was enacted subsequent to that by a large 

17

bipartisan majority, and I don't think it would be 

18

appropriate to look behind the legislature's action to 

19

consider and try to evaluate its motives.  And I think, 

20

under our Federal system, States get to make choices. 

21

 It's true, not every State does it this way, 

22

but many do.  They do so for reasons of efficient 

23

management of their internal operations, and that's the 

24

principle that we think is of critical importance here. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They may do so because of

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that reason.  You don't know what their reason is any 

2

more than I do.  All you can say is that that might be 

3

their reason. 

4

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

And they ought to have 

5

the discretion to make that choice under this Court's 

6

case law.  That's our position with respect to that. 

7

 If I could make a point that I think is an 

8

important point about the free rider rationale under 

9

Abood.  There's been some suggestion that the point of 

10

the free rider rationale is to  is to force the 

11

dissenters  the nonunion members to pay up. 

12

 I don't think that's the right way to 

13

understand the free rider point.  That, once the State 

14

has imposed a duty of fair representation, then 

15

everybody's got an incentive to free ride, whether 

16

you're a union supporter or not, because, by operation 

17

of law, you're going to get the benefits. 

18

 It's just a classic logic of collective 

19

action problem, and so the  the fair share requirement 

20

really is content neutral, in that it's  it's designed 

21

to ensure that the union has the funds it needs to carry 

22

out the responsibilities that the State wants it to 

23

carry out and that that could be jeopardized by 

24

supporters, as well as dissidents, deciding that they 

25

that they don't want to pay because they don't have to

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because the law would get them the benefit of the duty 

2

of fair representation even if they didn't. 

3

 Now, with respect to the question of  of 

4

whether Abood should be overruled, I would suggest to 

5

the Court that it's got a very powerful stare decisis 

6

effect behind it.  Abood's not exactly an outlier.  It 

7

was reaffirmed in Lehnert, in Ellis.  It was reaffirmed 

8

just in 2009, unanimously, in the Locke case. 

9

 As Justice Breyer indicated, there is very 

10

substantial reliance and contractual reliance throughout 

11

the country on the constitutionality of Abood. 

12

 And as I  I said, I think the most 

13

important point here is that the line the Court drew in 

14

Abood and the line that has stood for 40 years is 

15

entirely consistent with the Court's First Amendment 

16

jurisprudence in the context of government as employer, 

17

not as regulator of sovereign. 

18

 Of course, if the government was acting as 

19

sovereign regulating the citizenry, an obligation of 

20

this kind would trigger the most exacting scrutiny. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is it true that, from 

22

from the beginning, there have been members of this 

23

Court who have questioned whether there is any principle 

24

basis for distinguishing between the chargeable and the 

25

nonchargeable expenses and also have questioned whether

56

as a practical matter that can be done? 
 Justice Marshall made that argument, did he 
not. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes, certainly, that 

5

question has been raised.  But those questions were 

6

actually all raised before  may I please

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I suspect you're going to 

19

answer my question, so I want to focus it  and I'm 

20

sorry to do this, but I think it's important. 

21

 All right. 

I suspect you cannot answer my 

22

question about reliance without accepting one of the 

23

following three propositions:  First, unlike every other 

24

employee, government employees have no right to 

25

organize.

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Or, second, they have a right to organize, 

2

but they cannot bargain about wages, working conditions 

3

and hours, unlike any other, that's the same as the 

4

first. 

5

 Or, third, the courts of the United States 

6

are going to fashion, using the First Amendment as their 

7

weapon, a new special labor law for government 

8

employees.  And I'd remind you we have some experience 

9

on that in the 1930s, where courts tried to do something 

10
11
12
13

analogous. 
 All right. 

Now, answer my question about 

reliance. 
 MR. MESSENGER: 

I believe there  the 

14

reliance interests here are insignificant if Abood is 

15

overruled because the result will simply be that 

16

employees cannot be forced to support union 

17

representation.  The State 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why would anybody join 

19

a union under those circumstances or pay enough to 

20

support the union efforts? 

21

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Because the union, first, 

22

would control their terms of their economic conditions 

23

of employment and have control of their relations with 

24

their employer, which creates a strong incentive for an 

25

employee to want to be on good terms with that union.

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And also, usually, the union gains employer 

2

assistance with becoming an exclusive  or with 

3

retaining membership, such as access to facilities 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but it's only people 

5

who  who disagree with the  what the union's doing 

6

who could refuse to pay, you say?  Right? 

7
8
9

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Yes.  I mean, anyone who 

voluntarily 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why can't people who  who 

10

agree with the union just say, hey, I don't  I don't 

11

have to pay, the union is going to do this stuff anyway, 

12

I'm going to ride for free, these other people are 

13

riding for free? 

14
15
16

 MR. MESSENGER: 

People could have different 

motives, but I submit that the union has 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is there any  is there 

17

any way to decide who's doing it just to save money and 

18

who's doing it on principle? 

19

 MR. MESSENGER: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Not that I'm aware of. 
So  so you're essentially 

21

destroying not just the  not just the  the  closed 

22

shop, but you're destroying the ability of the union 

23

to  to get money even from the people who don't agree 

24

with what it's doing. 

25

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Well, two points.  First,

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exclusive representation, I submit, is not an impediment 

2

to gaining membership.  It helps the union gain 

3

voluntary support for it.  It's much easier for a union 

4

to ask people to support it, if it has power over their 

5

terms of employment. 

6

 So the free rider problem with an exclusive 

7

representative is actually less than it would be if the 

8

union was a voluntary organization, not as  it doesn't 

9

make it worse.  I mean, there's a reason that unions 

10

seek exclusive representation in the Federal government, 

11

in the Postal Service, and the nation's 24 righttowork 

12

States because it's 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Messenger, do you doubt 

14

that these  you said that there were no reliance 

15

interests, and  and that's curious to me.  There must 

16

be thousands and thousands of contracts across the 

17

United States with fair share provisions. 

18

 Do you doubt that these were core central 

19

provisions in the making of these contracts; that if 

20

these kinds of provisions were prohibited, the  the 

21

agreements would look fundamentally different in many 

22

ways? 

23

 MR. MESSENGER: 

The main difference is just 

24

the compulsory unionism clause in the agreement would be 

25

gone.  But otherwise, the agreements would be the same.

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You think that the union 

2

would  would not ask for anything, would not have 

3

different  you know, would not ask for different 

4

mechanisms in order to support its own activity? 

5

 The unions go into these contracts with the 

6

understanding that this is what's going to enable them 

7

to at once satisfy their universal obligation to 

8

employees to fairly represent them and, also, get the 

9

funds they need for administrative and other expenses. 

10

 MR. MESSENGER: 

I would submit that, with 

11

compelled fees off the table, the union would actually 

12

have more leverage to get things for employees because 

13

the compelled fees clause is leveraged for the employer 

14

because that's something the employer  or the union 

15

wants and that the employer doesn't care if it gives it 

16

away because, ultimately, that's money out of somebody 

17

else's pocket. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So you think that if we just 

19

strike these provisions, in other words, the  the 

20

contracts would have been negotiated in exactly the same 

21

way, nothing else would have changed? 

22
23

 MR. MESSENGER: 

If I may finish, Chief 

Justice. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

 MR. MESSENGER: 

Please. 

I believe that they probably

61

Alderson Reporting Company

1

would be very much the same.  To the extent they'd be 


2


different, they'd be more in the favor of employees, 


3


because the employer wouldn't have that leverage over 


4


the union with respect to its demand for compulsory 


5


fees.
