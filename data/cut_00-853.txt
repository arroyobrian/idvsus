ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BLUMENTHAL

10

We'll hear argument


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may


it please the Court:

This case is about the meaning of the term,


11

prison conditions, and the reason it is here is because


12

the Second Circuit misinterpreted that term contrary to


13

the purposes of Congress and the meaning given that term


14

by this Court.


15

In fact, Congress adopted this Court's language


16

when it passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996


17

and adopted the meaning of that term given to it by this


18

Court in a line of cases, Preiser v. Rodriguez, the


19

Bronson case, McCarthy v. Bronson, and Wilson v. Seiter,


20

that very clearly include single episode and excessive


21

force cases, which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals


22

excluded in its decision.

23

conditions, to exclude those kinds of single episode and


24

excessive forces instances of misconduct by prison


25

officials.


It interpreted the term, prison

QUESTION:

What's the universe of conditions and


2

nonconditions that you would suggest?

3

considerable discussion in the brief about the distinction


4

between 1983 suits and habeas corpus suits.

5

draw the line there, would you, or would you?


6

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

There was


You would not


Preiser v. Rodriguez draws


7

the line between habeas corpus petitions on the one hand


8

challenging the fact or duration of confinement and the on


9

the other hand conditions of prison life, or conditions of


10

his prison life, as it refers to the petitions that we


11

think are the universe that would be included in 1983


12

actions.

13

be regarded as conditions of confinement cases.


14

Virtually any conditions of prison life ought to


QUESTION:

Well, can you give me an example,


15

under your theory, of a case that is not covered by habeas


16

corpus, but that also are not a condition of prison life


17

which is a 1983 suit?

18

your theory?


19

When could a 1983 suit lie under


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Our position would be that


20

all of those 183 lawsuits ought to be subject, are subject


21

to the exhaustion requirement.

22

whether it's --


23

QUESTION:

There are no exclusions,


You can't think of any suit brought


24

by a prisoner that is not controlled by the term,


25

conditions, unless it's a habeas corpus suit?

1

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Well, if it were completely


2

unrelated to prison life -- an example might be, for


3

example, a lawsuit against a State tax commissioner, for


4

example, just to take one that seems relevant in light of


5

the earlier argument today, where the prisoner is claiming


6

that he's been denied a refund to which he's properly


7

entitled, and --


8
9
10

QUESTION:

You're saying that all Eighth


Amendment claims under 1983, which is what most of the

prison cases are.


11

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

12

QUESTION:

All --


They claim that they've been deprived


13

of a constitutional right because they have been sentenced


14

to prison and the conditions of that prison, whether it's


15

an isolated beating by a guard or anything else, are


16

unduly -- are cruel and unusual?


17

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

All


18

Eighth Amendment constitutional claims, indeed all


19

constitutional claims under 1983, this Court has never


20

established a hierarchy among such claims regarding


21

excessive force claims as deserving greater priority, so


22

that they ought to be spared the exhaustion requirement.


23

In fact, it is specifically said in Wilson v.


24

Garcia that, for example, on statute of limitations


25

questions there ought to be uniformity, and certainty, so


5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as to avoid the kind of litigation that also was the


2

purpose of Congress in passing the PLRA, and that is


3

really one of the key points here.


4

QUESTION:

That's an easier line.

What you're


5

saying is that the minute you begin defining a universe of


6

conditions which is smaller than the 1983 suits --


7

generally we have a whole jurisprudence that has to be


8

tested and create satellite litigation, et cetera, and I


9

understand that.

I'm just wondering if your definition is


10

prevailing, Congress would have used those words,


11

conditions.

12

involving prisoners, period.


13

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

It would have just said all 1983 suits


Justice Kennedy, Congress


14

used that term because it was used by this Court to


15

describe a category of the universe as set forth in


16

Preiser and again in McCarthy v. Bronson, where the court


17

faced a similar issue under the Magistrates Act, the


18

nonconsensual referral of petitions to magistrates, and


19

said that all of these cases, 1983 cases are, indeed,


20

conditions of confinement cases, and Congress wanted to


21

use that language and that meaning given by this term so


22

as to avoid corollary or, as you put it quite well,


23

satellite litigation that, in fact -- in fact has been


24

spawned in the Second Circuit by the Nussle case, and we


25

see it, for example, in Royster v. United States, which is


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

before this Court on cert, where excessive force is no


2

longer even involved.


3

It's a particularized instance, as the court of


4

appeals referred to it, of denial of the documents, legal


5

documents that the prisoner claims he is entitled to


6

receive, and courts then and now would have to decide what


7

kinds of cases are excessive force, if they are mixed with


8

other cases that may not be excessive force, if they seem


9

to involve in some respect ongoing conditions --


10

QUESTION:

You can certainly find some Eighth


11

Amendment claims that have nothing to do with excessive


12

force, I think.

13

earlier this term, a case called Molesco, which came from


14

the Second Circuit.

15

Litigation Act, but what happened there was that the


16

prisoner had a heart condition, he ordinarily was allowed


17

to use the elevator to go up to the sixth floor cell, this


18

day the prison attendant said no, you can't use the


19

elevator, so he walked up the stairs and had a heart


20

attack.


21

A case comes to mind that we decided


It didn't come here under the Prison


Now, that case was brought under the Eighth


22

Amendment. I take it under your view that if it were a


23

prison litigation action he should have to exhaust


24

administrative remedies.


25

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice. 


7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

He ought to be required to exhaust because in that case,


2

for example, the prison administrator could and might well


3

make adjustments to the facilities, might do retraining,


4

different decisions on hiring, in fact, disciplining --


5

QUESTION:

General Blumenthal, on the other side


6

of that is the argument that Nussle makes that he said


7

that the guards told me if I report what they did they


8

would kill me, so are there assurances -- you said the


9

value of -- no risk to the prisoners, this is going on, so


10

that they can cure it.

He says, if I told they said they


11

were going to kill me.

Are there assurances in the system


12

that there isn't going to be retaliation of someone who


13

makes an internal complaint?


14

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Certainly in Connecticut's


15

system, Justice Ginsburg, there are such assurances, and


16

in the joint appendix at 11 and at other places there are


17

requirements for confidentiality, for example.

18

requirement for an informal contact or request.


19

There is a


In the Connecticut system, the commissioner


20

entertains, personally reads, is on the floor and, indeed,


21

there is the requirement that the lieutenant make two


22

rounds every day, that a captain make one round, that he


23

be or she be accessible in those circumstances, and that


24

protection be provided, and that is, as a matter of fact,


25

one of the advantages of exhausting, because it assures

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

timely, prompt attention.

QUESTION:

General Blumenthal, I don't really


3

understand this.

4

you tell somebody through an administrative internal


5

procedure we're going to kill you, but it's perfectly okay


6

to go to a court directly.

7

exhaust administrative remedies.

8

exhaust administrative remedies.

10
11

Was the threat that the guards made, if


We just really want you to


(Laughter.)

QUESTION:
that's okay.

But if you go right to the court,


Is that realistically what the threat was?


12

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

matter what, don't you?

(Laughter.)


16

QUESTION:

17

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

You can't --

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

I would think so.

And it was never verified,


of course.

1

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

Well, they're learning,


2

Justice Scalia, and part of the claim here was one of


3

retaliation, but it --


4

QUESTION:

5

brought this case?


6

Was he still in prison when he


GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

He was in prison when he


7

brought this lawsuit.

He waited for 3 years.

He waited


8

until literally 3 to 5 days, depending on whether you look


9

at the complaint or whatever, until the statute of


10

limitations was about to expire, and then he went to


11

court.


12

It was not a timely, emergent, exigent plea for


13

help, and if there had been a real threat physically to


14

him, the prison administration would have afforded a far


15

more effective means of protection than going to Federal


16

court and seeking some remedy -- and by the way, he sought


17

money damages.

18

injunctive relief -- than going to Federal court and


19

seeking some remedy far in the future.


20

He didn't seek any protection or


The excessive force claim -- and I want to be


21

very frank about it -- is intertwined with the single


22

episode contention on which the court of appeals also


23

relied, and in our view the excessive force claim, the


24

threat of physical harm, is a more difficult one because


25

it's raised in this Court's cases, in Hudson v. McMillian,


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and Farmer v. Brennan, which deal with the element of


2

proof, the elements of proof that have to be provided to


3

make out a claim, with the standard of intent that has to


4

be shown.


5

QUESTION:

You acknowledge they do draw this


6

distinction between prison conditions and excessive force


7

cases?


8
9

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

They do, Justice Kennedy,


but only for the purpose of the standard of proof or


10

intent, and this Court has made that distinction very


11

clear in Crawford-El v. Britton, which is cited in the


12

briefs at 523 U.S. 574, and particularly at 585 the Court


13

draws the distinction, because in Crawford-El it is saying


14

that a heightened standard of intent need not be shown,


15

should not be required in order to protect prison


16

officials from frivolous lawsuits or from discovery.


17

And the Court says we have a law that will do


18

that, we have the PLRA, and it says about the PLRA, most


19

significantly, and I'm quoting from 585, most


20

significantly the statute draws no distinction between


21

constitutional claims that require proof of an improper


22

motive and those that do not, so the Court there -- and it


23

goes on to say, if there is a compelling need to frame new


24

rules of law based on such a distinction, presumably


25

Congress either would have dealt with the problem in the


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reform act, or will respond to it in future legislation.


2

What the Court is doing there is saying, and it


3

does so after a footnote that cites Farmer, and refers to


4

the Eighth Amendment, that is to say, footnote 7, we don't


5

mean that prison conditions should exclude the excessive


6

force claims simply because we have said in Farmer and


7

Hudson v. McMillian that under the questions presented


8

there they would do so, so the Court I think as answer --


9

this Court has answered that question, and --


10

QUESTION:

11

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

12

Is this the citation to Crawford-El?

Crawford-El is 523 United


States 574, and I have been quoting from 585.


13

QUESTION:

Thank you.


14

GENERAL BLUMENTHAL:

And 597.

The quote was


15

from 597, but I want to make clear, in fairness, that


16

quotation is not central to the holding of the case, which


17

I mentioned earlier.

18

draws so as to in effect provide reassurance that the


19

Prisoner Litigation Reform Act will do the job of


20

eliminating frivolous litigation as, indeed, it did in


21

1997a(c), where it provided for dismissal of actions that


22

are frivolous, malicious, or seek monetary damage from an


23

official who is immune, and it uses the term, prison


24

conditions.


25

It is a distinction that the Court


In fact, prison conditions is also a term used


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in 1997e(f), where there's a reference to the pretrial


2

proceedings that can occur by means of video, or


3

telephone, or other telephone communications technology. 


4

There is no reason that the term, prison conditions, in


5

those sections of the statute, ought to exclude excessive


6

force cases or single episode instances of misconduct and,


7

indeed, it would do violence, it would be directly


8

contradictory to the purposes of Congress, which were to


9

reduce the volume of litigation, particularly frivolous


10

litigation, to give prison administrators a chance to


11

correct errors or mistakes and to reduce the interference


12

of Federal courts in prison administration, and to provide


13

a better record if there is going to be resort to the


14

Federal courts.

With the Court's permission, if there are no


15
16

further questions I'd like to reserve the remainder of my


17

time.


18

Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.

25

Very well, General Blumenthal.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

For four reasons, actions that challenge


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

particular instances of unlawful conduct such as excessive


2

force are actions with respect to prison conditions that


3

must be exhausted under the PLRA.


4

First, in three cases, this Court has used the


5

terms, prison conditions, or conditions of confinement, to


6

refer to particular instances of unlawful conduct and, in


7

one of those cases, McCrary v. Bronson, it applied the


8

term to a single episode of excessive force.

9

reason to think that Congress intended any narrower


10

There's no


meaning here.

Second, the purposes of the exhaustion provision


11
12

are to give prison officials an opportunity to resolve


13

problems within the prison by themselves, and to reduce


14

the enormous volume of prison litigation in Federal


15

courts.

16

absolutely no reason to distinguish between actions that


17

challenge particular instances of unlawful conduct such as


18

excessive force and any other sort of prisoner complaint. 


19

Prison authorities in fact have a particularly strong


20

interest in resolving complaints about staff misconduct on


21

their own, and grievance procedures are fully effective to


22

do that without any need for significant Federal court


23

litigation.


24
25

In terms of those two purposes, there's


Third, as this Court has recognized, it is

extremely difficult to administer a line between isolated


14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

episodes or particular instances and more systematic


2

practices, or actions undertaken pursuant to a policy. 


3

Any effort to do that would generate substantial


4

additional litigation on a threshold collateral issue when


5

Congress' goal was to reduce the amount of judicial


6

resources devoted to prisoner complaints.


7

And finally, creating an exception for


8

particular instances of unlawful conduct has the potential


9

to create an enormous loophole in the exhaustion


10

requirement.

11

the Second Circuit to retaliation claims, to confiscation


12

of property claims, and it has the potential and


13

capability to be applied to a wide variety of prisoner


14

complaints that are directed at the actions of individual


15

officers.


16

Already, that exception has been applied by


It is very unlikely that the Congress amended


17

this exhaustion provision for the express purpose of


18

making sure that a dramatically increased number of cases


19

would have to go through the exhaustion process, would


20

have simultaneously cut out that large category of claims


21

that could benefit from the exhaustion process.


22

QUESTION:

Could you tell me on your point 1,


23

you cited the case where excessive force applied to --


24

prison conditions applied to a single incident.

25

that case?


What was


15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GORNSTEIN:

2

QUESTION:

3

McCrary v. Bronson.


And was that pre or post enactment of


the litigation reform act?


4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GORNSTEIN:

That's preenactment.


Preenactment.

And in that case was a


7

construction of the Magistrates Act that had nonconsensual


8

referral in cases involving conditions of confinement, and


9

the Court interpreted the phrase, Conditions of


10

confinement, to embrace single incidents, including


11

excessive force, and rejected an alternative construction


12

that is similar to the one adopted by the Second Circuit


13

here that prison conditions refers to systematic


14

practices, and it did so for the same reasons, really,


15

that you should reach the same conclusion here.


16

The Court said that the purpose of that act was


17

to reduce the workload of Federal courts, and that would


18

further that purpose, and it said that trying to draw that


19

distinction between individual actions and systematic


20

practices would provoke -- generate a whole new round of


21

litigation, when what we're trying to deal with here is


22

something that's trying to save time.


23

QUESTION:

24

MR. GORNSTEIN:

25

What about Hudson and Farmer?

Hudson and Farmer show that the


term, prison conditions, can be used in a narrower sense,


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and that context matters, but here the context was in


2

defining the substantive elements for proving a particular


3

kind of Eighth Amendment violation, and the substantive


4

standards for proving a claim really have nothing to do


5

with whether a claim should be exhausted.


6

The context we have here is an exhaustion


7

provision, and the purposes of exhaustion, as I have said,


8

are to give prison officials a chance to act first to


9

solve a problem and to reduce the volume of litigation


10

and, in light of those purposes, it simply makes no sense


11

to adopt a narrower meaning.

12

adopt a broader meaning that comes from Preiser v.


13

Rodriguez, and McCrary v. Bronson, and Wilson v. Seiter.

QUESTION:

14

Instead, the Court should


Of course, still in all, even in


15

Hudson, I guess, drawing a distinction between continuing


16

prison conditions and single incident prison conditions,


17

or single incidents that aren't prison conditions, still


18

involves you in the same problem of satellite litigation 


19

that you say would be one of the horrible effects of


20

adopting the same interpretation in the present case.

21

mean, that didn't stop us from coming out that way in


22

Hudson.

Maybe it should have, but it didn't.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

23

I


Justice Scalia, two responses to


24

that.

One is that the line that was actually drawn in


25

Hudson as I read it is not between single instances and


17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

systematic practices, it's between excessive force claims


2

and everything else, which is -- does still have its


3

difficulties in administration, but maybe not quite as


4

challenging as single instances versus systematic


5

practices.


6

The other difference is, we're talking about


7

applying something at the liability stage to make a


8

determination on whether there has been liability enough,


9

as opposed to, what do we do right at the outset of


10

litigation when somebody comes in with a complaint, it's a


11

threshold question, and generating additional litigation


12

about that on a threshold question on a collateral issue


13

it seems to me is something that you would want to


14

generate less litigation about, generally speaking.


15

If the Court has no further questions --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. WILLIAMS


19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


20
21
22

MR. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:

When Congress enacted the Prison Litigation


23

Reform Act, it did so on the heels of at least three


24

decisions by this Court which clearly defined the term,


25

prison conditions, to exclude excessive force cases and


18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those cases start, of course, with Wilson v. Seiter, which


2

expressly held, and I will quote, the very high state of


3

mind prescribed by Whitley does not apply to prison


4

conditions cases.


5
6

QUESTION:

What was at issue in Wilson v.


Seiter?


7

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, of course, that was a


8

medical indifference case, deliberate indifference case


9

involving the distinction between a single incident and


10

multiple incidents, and to the extent that the Second


11

Circuit, post Nussle, has gone on to attempt to draw a


12

distinction of that kind, we do not defend it.

13

distinction which I think is applicable here in defining


14

the term, prison conditions, is excessive force cases


15

versus all other types of cases, other than --

QUESTION:

16

The


So on the other side of the line so


17

far as you're concerned would be a number of single


18

incident types of thing that did not involve excessive


19

force?


20

MR. WILLIAMS:

Yes, indeed.

I think the


21

distinction is one that this Court has made it absolutely


22

clear the distinction is between -- has to do with the


23

mens rea that's required.

24

sadistic, intending to cause pain, that's not a prison


25

condition.

that is a prison condition.


2

QUESTION:

But why would Congress have made that


3

distinction and said that one -- the kind of cases you're


4

refer -- shouldn't exhaust administrative remedies whereas


5

the other one should.

6

certainly draw a definitional line, but why would Congress


7

have said case A exhaust, case B don't?


8
9

It doesn't -- I can see -- you can


MR. WILLIAMS:
different.

Well, excessive force cases are


They've always been different under this


10

Court's jurisprudence.

11

are already built in to avoid frivolous litigation in the


12

excessive force context.


13

There are many protections that


For example, the standard itself, cruel,


14

malicious, sadistic, is a very tough one to meet.

15

Leatherman, of course, did not remove or excuse getting


16

away with just notice pleading.

17

pleading, so that when you combine the requirement of fact


18

pleading with the high standard that has to be met there's


19

a very -- it's a very rare case that will pass a 12(b)(6)


20

motion if it's an excessive force case in the first place.


21

QUESTION:

Second,


It required fact


Isn't the answer to your argument,


22

though, the answer that Mr. Gornstein gave a moment ago


23

when he referred to the significance of context?

24

issue before the Court involves a distinction among


25

different kinds of prison cases, then we can certainly


If the


20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

understand the distinction when we say conditions are


2

different from particular incidents, and if you refer only


3

conditions, you're meaning to exclude particular


4

incidents.


5

But if we're trying to draw a distinction


6

between prison cases and all kinds of -- all other kinds


7

of 1983 cases, which was the case when Congress passed


8

this statute, then I suppose it does make good sense to


9

use prison conditions in a much broader sense to cover


10

everything that might come out of prison litigation to


11

distinguish it from other kinds of 1983 cases, and isn't


12

that the answer to your argument based on our use of the


13

term in certain cases?


14

MR. WILLIAMS:

I think that's more a policy


15

issue than a statutory construction issue, and I think


16

that this is just a simple case of statutory construction.


17

QUESTION:

But the -- I mean, Mr. Gornstein's


18

argument is kind of a compared-to-what argument.

He's


19

saying, when you use the phrase, conditions, what are you


20

comparing the conditions against?

21

against other kinds of things that happen in a prison, or


22

are you comparing them against other kinds of cases that


23

might be brought under 1983, and the answer is possibly


24

going to be quite different, depending on which context


25

you're in.


Are you comparing them


21
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, I think the context in


2

which this Court has used it, and therefore in which


3

Congress is presumed to have used it, is the latter.


4
5

QUESTION:

The cases that, including the one you


cite, the Government cites for the opposite proposition.


6

MR. WILLIAMS:

7

QUESTION:

I think --


The cases say, and they have loads of


8

language there which seem to say it, that Wilson v. Seiter


9

and three other cases did focus on the issue of single


10

incident versus affecting several people.

They all


11

decided that single incident is within the meaning of


12

prison conditions or the like.

Senator Biden on the floor says, if you pass


13
14

this law, you are going to sweep within it excessive force


15

cases, and nobody denies it, all of which from the most --


16

and the language, the language admits of Justice Souter's


17

suggestion, and he provides a purpose.

So taking all those things together, why isn't


18
19

the law in this case precisely along the lines he


20

suggested?

MR. WILLIAMS:

21

There's no doubt that the cases


22

involved do not see a principal distinction between single


23

incident and multiple incident cases.

24

where the Second Circuit in the post Nussle cases has gone


25

wrong.

I don't defend that.

That, I think, is


I think that the distinction


22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is the one that this Court has always drawn, which is


2

between the excessive force mens rea, which is cruel,


3

malicious, sadistic, intending to cause pain and nothing


4

else, on the one hand --


5

QUESTION:

That's only excessive force?


6

QUESTION:

That's only excessive force?


7

QUESTION:

I see somebody in dire need of


8

medical attention and I sit there smiling cruelly --


9

please, get me a doctor.


10

MR. WILLIAMS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WILLIAMS:

That is exactly --


You call that excessive force?

That's -- no.

13

indifference.

14

exactly what we're talking about.


This Court has often said that.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WILLIAMS:

17

QUESTION:

18

There -- it's -- indeed --


It has nothing to do with the things


you were saying, then, cruelty, and savagery, whatever. 

MR. WILLIAMS:

20

QUESTION:

22

That's


Well --


19

21

That's deliberate


Well, the term is --


You can be just as cruel and savage


without applying excessive force, if you do it right.

MR. WILLIAMS:

The -- we can have words mean


23

whatever we want them to mean, but this Court has made it


24

clear what it means when it refers to excessive force, and


25

that is the mens rea that we were just talking about


23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which, after all, comes from Judge Friendly's seminal


2

opinion in Johnson v. Glick.


3

That, however, is not what we mean when we talk


4

about prison conditions, and this Court has made that


5

clear, and made it clear at the time Congress enacted the


6

PLRA, and I think that the important distinction between


7

the PLRA and the Magistrates Act is that when the


8

Magistrates Act was passed, all they had -- and that's


9

what this Court held in McCarthy v. Bronson, all they had


10

to guide them on the meaning of the term was Preiser, and


11

so following Preiser, of course, that's what it meant, and


12

that's why they used it that way in the Magistrates Act.


13

But after this Court decided McCarthy and


14

Brennan, this Court then went on to address the issue,


15

focus on the language, and explain this very distinction


16

that I'm arguing for here, and it was after this Court had


17

done so in three cases, one after the other, that Congress


18

then passed the PLRA.


19

QUESTION:

That's what I don't understand.

Now,


20

I didn't realize this.

You're conceding, I take it, that


21

an individual incident is a prison condition, as long as


22

it isn't an excessive force incident, and at that point,


23

although maybe there are three cases that say this -- I'll


24

read them -- why would anybody want to say that a single


25

incident refusing to feed a prisoner, a single incident


24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

refusing to give him medical assistance, a single incident


2

refusing to let him take exercise in fact is a prison


3

condition, but a single incident of hitting him is not?


4

MR. WILLIAMS:

I can't speak for Congress'


5

intention, but I can speak for the meaning of the words as


6

they've been defined by the Court, and there is an obvious


7

distinction under this Court's cases.

8

talking about when we talk about statutory construction,


9

and that's why I say that this is not a grand policy case. 


10

This is a traditional --


11

QUESTION:

12

reaching a sensible result.


13

That's what we're


Well, but we're also talking about


MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, the sensible result is the


14

result that this Court has often reached in the past,


15

which is to say to Congress, if this is what you want to


16

do, do it in the way that you're supposed to do it.


17
18
19

QUESTION:

But it really isn't quite that clear


what Congress wanted to do as between these two views.

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, of course, if Congress is


20

ambiguous, then we go back to the default position, and


21

the default position is, we go back to dictionary meaning,


22

and this Court held in McCarthy v. Bronson that if you


23

just look to the dictionary definition of the term, prison


24

conditions, you're not talking about excessive force


25

cases, and in McCarthy this Court said, however, we don't


25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

use the dictionary definition because when the Magistrates


2

Act was passed Congress is presumed to have been looking


3

to Preiser, but once Congress gets mushy, as they really


4

are in the PLRA, because some sections use the term prison


5

conditions, some sections don't, and that's even true in


6

the title 42 amendment, so --


7

QUESTION:

Mr. Williams, there's a case that has


8

come up in various forms where violence, random violence


9

is what characterizes the prison system.

There was the


10

litigation in Alabama, where the State Attorney General


11

said, this, the atmosphere in this prison is jungle-like,


12

and this Court said it in Dosset v. Rawlinson.

13

you put those cases?

14

it's pervasive in the prison, not just one beating by a


15

guard.

16

Litigation Reform Act, even though you're talking about


17

the kind of conduct that pervades the entire institution?


18

Where do


Those are excessive force cases, but


Would those cases come outside the prison


MR. WILLIAMS:

I'm not sure that this Court has


19

ever told us exactly what the mens rea is that must be met


20

in such a case, and I think that will be the answer to the


21

question when that case arises.

22

in any given pervasive violence situation, then the


23

necessary mens rea remains the Johnson v. Glick one, then


24

that's an excessive force case and it's not a prison


25

conditions case.


If this Court says that


26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

On the other hand, if this Court says that the


2

necessary mens rea is simply deliberate indifference, then


3

it is a prison conditions case.


4
5

QUESTION:

Well, it's hard to say it's


deliberate indifference when you're beating up on someone.


6

MR. WILLIAMS:

If you're suing the individual


7

guard, of course, you're dealing with an instance of


8

brutality.

9

question of where the warden issues a decree.


10

What I was thinking of is the more interesting


QUESTION:

The warden knows that this is going


11

on.

12

jungle-like atmosphere.


13

It's not deliberate indifference, because it's a


MR. WILLIAMS:

If the warden is aware of it and


14

is tolerating it, then it becomes policy, and then this


15

Court is going to have to say, well, what's the standard


16

of liability for the warden?

17

indifference or is it the Johnson v. Glick?

18

I don't believe this Court has told us.


19

QUESTION:

Is it deliberate

I don't know. 


I would think that just the usage,


20

ordinary English, what the words mean, when a condition


21

pervades a prison, then it's a prison condition.


22

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, I think that that gets off


23

into the single incident versus multiple incident issue,


24

and I prefer to think of it in terms of the mens rea, and


25

I can conceive that an argument might well be made, and in
