 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 1210882, Hall v. Florida. 

5

 Mr. Waxman. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8

 MR. WAXMAN: 

9

please the Court: 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 In Atkins v. Virginia, this Court held that 

11

the Constitution bars executing persons with mental 

12

retardation; that is, persons with significantly 

13

subaverage intellectual function concurrent with 

14

deficits in adaptive behavior with an onset before the 

15

age of 18. 

16

 Because of the standard error of measurement 

17

that's inherent in IQ tests, it is universally accepted 

18

that persons with obtained scores of 71 to 75 can and 

19

often do have mental retardation when those three prongs 

20

are met.  The statistical error of measurement or SEM is 

21

that 

22
23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Waxman, a line has 

to be drawn somewhere. 

24

 And we did say in Atkins that we would leave 

25

it up to the States to determine the standards for this

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

issue.  So what's the rule we announce today?  We tell 

2

them 70 is not okay, but 75 would be?  I'm not quite 

3

sure.  How would you announce the rule? 

4

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Let me first take  take some 

5

issue, with all due respect, with your characterization 

6

of Atkins.  What this Court said in Atkins is not that 

7

we leave it to the States to establish the standards for 

8

the clinical condition of mental retardation. 

9

 What you said, quoting Ford, is, "We leave 

10

it to the States to  we leave to the States the task 

11

of developing appropriate ways to enforce the 

12

constitutional restriction that we announce." 

13

 The rule that we advocate is  and the only 

14

real question presented in this case is just this:  If a 

15

State conditions the opportunity to demonstrate mental 

16

retardation on obtained IQ test scores, it cannot ignore 

17

the measurement error that is inherent in those scores 

18

that is a feature, statistical feature of the test 

19

instrument itself. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but we didn't  we 

21

didn't base our decision in Atkins upon a study of what 

22

the American Psychiatric Association and other medical 

23

associations considered to be mental retardation.  We 

24

based it on what  what was the general rule that 

25

States had adopted.  And a large number of States had

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adopted 70 as the criterion.  I mean, the criterion is 

2

what do the American people think is the level of mental 

3

retardation that should make it impossible to impose the 

4

death penalty. 

5

 We didn't look for the answer to that 

6

question to the APA or any of the other medical 

7

associations.  We looked to what the States did. 

8
9
10

 Now, what has changed in what the States do? 
Anything? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Justice Scalia, I have  I 

11

would like to respond with four points, and I hope 

12

desperately I'll remember them. 

13

 First of all, what this Court said was, this 

14

Court  number one, it made clear, as it has reiterated 

15

in Miller v. Alabama and Graham v. Florida, that while a 

16

consensus or a perceived consensus among the States is 

17

important, the ultimate test is this Court's conclusion 

18

about what the Eighth Amendment does or doesn't allow. 

19

 In making that determination at page 318 of 

20

this Court's opinion in Atkins, this Court, after 

21

reciting in Footnote 3 the virtually identical clinical 

22

definitions of mental retardation, and in Footnote 5, 

23

pointing out that 70 to 75 is the established cutoff for 

24

mental retardation, this Court said the following: 

25

Quote, "Clinical definitions of mental retardation

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

require"  and it recited the three tests.  "Because of 

2

their impairments, mentally retarded persons by 

3

definition"  that is by the clinical definition 

4

"have diminished capacities to understand"  and it 

5

recited all the other disabilities that made the 

6

imposition of the death penalty for persons with that 

7

excuse me  with that clinical condition 

8

unconstitutional. 

9

 Now, as to what the States did, the Court 

10

did refer to, I believe, 18 State statutes.  Not a 

11

single one of those State statutes and not a single 

12

decision of the highest court of any State or any court 

13

in any State applied 70 or two standard deviations from 

14

the mean without reference to the SEM. 

15

 The only statute that addressed it in 2002, 

16

when this Court decided Atkins, was Arizona, which 

17

expressly provided that the SEM must be taken into 

18

account in evaluating the  an obtained IQ test score. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The SEM being  being what 

and  and established by whom? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

The standard error of 

22

measurement, which is established by the creators of the 

23

test.  It is not something that clinicians dream up. 

24

It's not something that is decided by the AAIDD or the 

25

American Psychiatric Association.  It is inherent in the

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

test.  And all clinicians are told  both professional 

2

associations make clear, because it is simply a 

3

statistical fact, it must be taken into account such 

4

that an obtained IQ test score is actually the result of 

5

an obtained IQ test score, is a test band that accounts 

6

for the standard. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

For what purpose do they 

8

establish these scores?  Is it for the purpose of 

9

determining who is so incapable of  of controlling his 

10

actions that he shouldn't be subject to the death 

11

penalty?  Is that  is that what they're looking for 

12

when they establish 70 to 75?  What are they looking 

13

for? 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, what they're  they are 

15

looking for  I mean, intelligence tests supply a  I 

16

mean, they weren't created for the definition of 

17

clinical definition of mental retardation.  They were 

18

created as a  in order to determine a proxy for true 

19

intellectual function.  And therefore 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

 MR. WAXMAN: 

22
23

Right. 
 a true IQ test score  I 

mean, the general clinical 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm not talking about IQ 

24

tests in general.  I'm talking about why do they pick 

25

they used to pick 70.  Now they pick between 70 and 75

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as the upper limit.  What are  upper limit for what? 

2

I assume it is for people who would profit from medical 

3

treatment.  Isn't that it? 

4

 MR. WAXMAN: 

There are many reasons why a 

5

person's IQ, that is, a person's intelligent 

6

intellectual functioning, may be important for a whole 

7

variety of reasons, medical, psychological, 

8

developmental, and as a component of the clinical 

9

condition of mental retardation, the Eighth Amendment. 

10
11

Now, what intellectual 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Waxman, could we just 

12

clarify one thing, that what you refer to as the SEM, 

13

that is not limited to IQ of 70, 75.  That's across the 

14

board. 

15

 MR. WAXMAN: 

I mean, the  the concept, the 

16

statistical concept of a standard error of measurement 

17

has  applies to all forms of testing. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So it has nothing to do 

with the death penalty and mental retardation 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

No.  I mean, I'm sure that, you 

21

know, when Archimedes announced his principle based on 

22

experimental  his experimental observations, he also 

23

recognized the  essentially the standard error of 

24

measurement. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

May I come back to a

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question?  May I come back to something similar to what 

2

Justice Sotomayor started out with.  In your view, does 

3

the Constitution establish a State to establish any hard 

4

cutoff?  Let's say 76.  Can it do that? 

5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

I think it can because that 

6

falls  because the standard definition of prong one, 

7

that is, intellectual functioning, is two or more 

8

standard deviations below the mean. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

10

that  oh, I'm sorry. 

11

 MR. WAXMAN: 

All right.  If it can do 

I'm sorry.  Let me just  let 

12

me just explain.  And because  if  if a State is 

13

using an obtained IQ test score as a proxy for true 

14

intellectual function, it has to take into account the 

15

standard error of measurement.  And therefore, States 

16

like Mississippi and Oklahoma that, in fact, establish a 

17

cutoff of 75, in our view, is constitutional as this 

18

Court announced the class of individuals in 

19

Atkins because 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So that's just 

21

saying  I'm sorry.  When you say the standard error of 

22

measuring, you're talking about a degree of confidence, 

23

right? 

24

 MR. WAXMAN: 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Correct. 

9

Alderson Reporting Company

And your submission

Official

1

is that you need to have a 95 percent degree of 

2

confidence.  That's what  that's what the 5 gives you 

3

or do I have the numbers wrong? 

4

 MR. WAXMAN: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6
7
8
9
10

Well 
I thought the 

standard 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

The  on a test that is normed 

at 100 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Right. 

 70 is two standard 

11

deviations below the mean.  If there is a  the 

12

standard error of measurement  and it's not  this is 

13

not my submission.  This is the universal 

14
15
16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I know.  I'm just 

trying to figure out what it means. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

That's exactly  what it means 

17

is that someone, for example, with an I  an obtained 

18

IQ test score of 71, as Mr. Hall received, has a 95 

19

percent probability 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

 MR. WAXMAN: 

22
23
24
25

Okay. 

 that his score will be 

between 76 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So why is 95 

percent?  Where does that come from? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

That  that is 

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 under Atkins? 

2

Why  why are you picking 95 percent?  Why isn't it 

3

90 percent? 

4

 MR. WAXMAN: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6
7

I'm not doing any picking. 
Why did the other 

why did the  the organizations pick 95 percent. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

It's been 95  it's been two 

8

standard error of  two SEMs, which is 95 percent, for 

9

decades and decades, and this Court recognized that 

10

consensus, that universal consensus, in footnote 5 in 

11

its opinion in 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Which party has the burden 

13

of persuasion on the issue of IQ and what is the 

14

standard? 

15
16
17

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So it varies from State to 

State. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I mean, what  what does 

18

the Eighth Amendment require?  Does the Eighth Amendment 

19

permit a State to assign to the defendant the burden of 

20

persuasion on  on IQ, IQ above 75?  Can they assign 

21

that burden of  above 70?  Can they assign that to the 

22

defendant, and if they can what is the standard of proof 

23

that the defendant has to meet? 

24
25

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So I  the short answer is, I 

believe, what I will come to is yes, so that you see

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where I'm going.  But we believe that it is entirely 

2

constitutional for the State to assign the burden of 

3

proving mental retardation on the defendant.  And 

4

insofar as the clinical definition recognized by this 

5

Court in Atkins is a threepart conjunctive test, I 

6

think it's fair to say that a logical consequence of 

7

that is that as to every component the burden may 

8

constitutionally be placed on the defendant. 

9

 Now, the burden with respect to prong one is 

10

the burden of proving significantly subaverage 

11

intellectual functioning, of which a true IQ score is a 

12

probabilistic piece of evidence.  I don't think 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why can't the State  you 

14

told me that the State can establish a hard cutoff.  And 

15

you told me that a State can assign the burden to the 

16

defendant. 

17

 Now, in the case of someone who scores 75, 

18

is it not the case that there's roughly  there's no 

19

more than a 2.5 percent chance that that person's real 

20

IQ is 70.  So how does that square with any burden of 

21

proof that might be  any standard of proof that might 

22

be assigned on that  on that point?  That's what I 

23

don't understand about your argument. 

24
25

 MR. WAXMAN: 

I think  let me see if I can 

explain this.  First of all, we're talking  I mean,

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this is a man who has a 71. 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

3

 MR. WAXMAN: 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

5
6

No, I understand. 
Okay. 
But I'm talking about the 

general issue.  Just hypothetically 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

As  as to the general issue, 

7

let me  let me  let me state it this way:  The whole 

8

idea behind measurement error is that you can't make a 

9

valid judgment that somebody doesn't have a true score 

10

of 70 or below if the obtained score is within the 

11

measurement error.  And even more fundamental than that, 

12

the  your question suggests and the State's suggestion 

13

suggests that diagnosing mental retardation, which is 

14

the constitutional inquiry, is just a probabilistic 

15

inquiry into a person's, quote, "true" IQ score.  But 

16

true IQ scores themselves are a statistical concept. 

17

It's the score that you would get on a hypothetical test 

18

that had no measurement error.  But true  and this is 

19

my point  true IQ is not the same as intellectual 

20

function and IQ tests themselves, however perfect they 

21

may be, don't perfectly capture a person's intellectual 

22

function, which is why 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I understand that argument. 

24

But that doesn't seem to me consistent with your point 

25

that a State can establish a hard cutoff.  76, that's

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the end.  You get a 76 on an IQ test, that's the end of 

2

the inquiry.  The person does not  does not  does 

3

not qualify under Atkins. 

4

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So I  what I'm  this 

5

this would not be a standard I would endorse, but I 

6

believe that in light of the consensus test that all 

7

professional organizations apply that was recognized in 

8

Atkins, a score that is above the standard error of 

9

measurement of two standard deviations above the mean 

10

would be okay.  But the point  the converse point it 

11

seems to me is not true, which is we know for a fact 

12

that many, many people who obtain test scores of 71 to 

13

75, in fact, have mental retardation. 

14

 And if I just may point out that in this 

15

case, there were six experts who fully examined Mr. 

16

Hall or supervised a full examination of Mr. Hall.  They 

17

were cognizant of the IQ test scores that he had 

18

received.  And each one of them opined without 

19

hesitation that he had mental retardation, functional 

20

mental retardation, significant 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Retrospectively. 
Excuse me? 
The district court did 

24

make a finding that he did not show adaptive behavior, 

25

and the district court said that that was so because all

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of those experts that you've referred to were speaking 

2

retrospectively.  There was no evidence of what the 

3

defendant's current condition was.  That was  I think 

4

it's in the Joint Appendix 

5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

That is correct, Justice 

6

Ginsburg.  Now, the State trial court ruled that it 

7

would not accept evidence as to prongs two and three, 

8

but it did allow Mr. Hall's lawyers to make a proffer 

9

pursuant to the State's  the State's agreement that 

10

there could be a proffer in some expeditious manner. 

11

And that's at Joint Appendix 158. 

12

 We  one of the two grounds that we 

13

appealed to the Florida Supreme Court on, in addition to 

14

the hard cutoff at 70, was the fact that in fact an 

15

expeditious proffer did not in fact permit us to put on 

16

all of our evidence about prongs two and three.  And the 

17

Florida Supreme Court, and this is page 125 of the Joint 

18

Appendix, said:  We don't need to consider that question 

19

because we uphold the rule in Cherry. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, what  there was 

21

nothing that limited you to the retrospective proof. 

22

The  the trial judge asked a simple question, how did 

23

the defendant adapt in prison, and quotes one expert as 

24

saying:  "Well, I didn't test for that.  I don't know 

25

why I didn't do it."  And that same expert said that he

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

had, in fact, done it in other cases. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

You're correct.  Part of the 

3

expeditious proffer  the expeditious proffer was 

4

limited to the testimony of two of  I believe actually 

5

only one of the experts who examined him and did the 

6

adaptive testing function, and that expert did say that 

7

he didn't test in prison. 

8
9

 Now, as  there is, again, a universal 
professional consensus that adaptive functioning is 

10

tested by adaptive functioning in the real world, not 

11

adaptive functioning that occurs on  after 35 years on 

12

death row. 

13

 And, in fact, we also know to a clinical 

14

certainty that because mental retardation is a condition 

15

that is both developmental and not transient, that is, 

16

there has to be an onset  demonstrated onset during 

17

the developmental period, but one doesn't emerge from 

18

the condition of mental retardation, unlike, for 

19

example, mental illness. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If you talk about the 

21

condition of mental disability that's involved here, I 

22

want to go back to something you've said in response to 

23

Justice Scalia.  The question was along the line of what 

24

does it mean to have a disorder under the DSM. 

25

Obviously, one thing it means is that the scholars can

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

talk about it; that they can all focus on the same 

2

subject. 

3

 Does it have any meaning other than that, 

4

that it  it is an objective index, an objective 

5

characterization that certain people have a certain 

6

mental condition?  Is  is that what it means? 

7

 MR. WAXMAN: 

That's exactly what it means, 

8

Justice Kennedy.  What it means is, it is a  as this 

9

Court recognized, it is a clinical condition, unlike, 

10

for example, insanity or competence.  That the 

11

clinical 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is  is there  is there 

13

any evidence that society in general gives substantial 

14

deference to the psychiatric profession in this respect? 

15

Are there any studies on that or is there anything we 

16

can look to to see that that's true on not true? 

17

 MR. WAXMAN: 

I  I'm actually not aware of 

18

anything that suggests that one  that society doesn't 

19

look to professional evaluations to do this.  And, in 

20

fact, if one looks only at Florida's system, Florida 

21

uses mental retardation as a determinant for things 

22

other than the death penalty.  It uses the existence of 

23

the condition for educational remediation, vocational 

24

rehabilitation and everything.  And in those instances, 

25

as we point out in our brief, the  the Florida 

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Florida does apply the standard error of measurement. 

2

And indeed 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

We have later in the week 

4

an argument about economic theories.  And it's a little 

5

different because in that case, the Court  it's the 

6

Court's own jurisprudence and we have not said, as we 

7

have in Atkins, that it's up to the State.  But do you 

8

think we defer to psychiatric  psychologists and 

9

psychiatrists any more than we  or any less than we do

to economists? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Oh, I think it has to be much, 

12

much, more because, as this Court pointed out, this is a 

13

clinical condition.  It's a condition that can only be 

14

appropriately diagnosed by professionals. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mister 
They change  they changed 

17

their mind, counsel.  This APA is the same organization 

18

that once said that homosexuality was a  was a mental 

19

disability and now says it's perfectly normal.  They 

20

change their minds. 

21

 MR. WAXMAN:

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

And they have changed their 

23

minds as to whether 70 or 75 is the  is the new 

24

test  for for mental retardation. 

25

 MR. WAXMAN: 

The latter is not true.  The 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the standard  two things that are not in dispute in 

2

this case.  We're only here talking about prong one, 

3

which is significantly subaverage intellectual 

4

functioning and nothing else.  And everyone agrees, all 

5

the States agree, they all agreed at the time Atkins was 

6

decided, that their  that the clinical definition is 

7

defined by three elements and that the first element, 

8

significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is 

9

defined as a person whose intellectual function is two 

10

or more standard deviations below the mean intellectual 

11

functioning of contemporary society. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Waxman, can I take you 

13

back to a question that the Chief Justice asked? 

14

Because the Chief Justice said, you know, where does 

15

this SEM come from.  And it is the test maker's 

16

determination that this is the margin of error that 

17

gives you a 95 percent confidence. 

18

 I guess the question here or one question 

19

here is why do we have a 95 percent  why do we need a 

20

95 percent confidence level? 

21

 And you could say it either way. 

You could 

22

say, gosh, we're putting somebody to death, we should 

23

we should have a 100 percent confidence level.  Or you 

24

could say, as I take it Justice Alito  Justice Alito's 

25

point was, well, look, the burden of proof is on the

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defendant here anyway, so a 95 percent confidence level 

2

seems awfully high.  We should, you know, ration it down 

3

to 80 percent. 

4

 So why for this purpose do we have to go 

5

with the test maker's determination that 5 is what gives 

6

you a 95 percent confidence level? 

7

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So the fact that two SEMs gives 

8

you a 95 percent confidence level is just the 

9

statistical fact.  I take your question to be, well, why 

10

does  you know, why do clinicians and professional 

11

associations use that? 

12
13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well  and that's not 

really my question. 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Oh, I see. 
I understand why they might 

16

use it for a wide variety of purposes.  The question is: 

17

Why does their determination that it's useful for a wide 

18

variety of purposes to have a 95 percent confidence 

19

level, why is the State stuck with that for this 

20

purpose? 

21

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Because the whole  and this 

22

goes to the reason that they use it.  The reason that 

23

they use it is because of the inherent imprecision in 

24

testing in general, but in particular testing for the 

25

presence of something like relative intellectual

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

functioning. 
 There are so many  it is so common for 

3

people who, for a variety of reasons, obtain a 71 or 72, 

4

in fact, to have mental retardation and because evidence 

5

of  an evaluation of intellectual function involves 

6

clinically much more than a test score.  I mean, look 

7

what happened in this case.  All of the IQ tests that 

8

were administered, all of the Wechsler tests, were 

9

accompanied, because they fell within the standard error 

10

of measurement, they were accompanied by the 

11

administration of further intelligence testing for 

12

confirmatory purposes. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Is that what you want? 

14

That is, I go back to Justice Sotomayor's question. 

15

Start monkeying around with 95 percent.  It's all over 

16

the law.  I mean, 95 percent is a classical measure by 

17

scientists of when they have confidence that the fact 

18

that the regression analysis seems to establish is in 

19

fact a fact. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
That is in tort law.  That 

22

is in whether jury trials are  are discriminating 

23

because they don't have black people on the jury.  It's 

24

all over the law.  So I assume that we  you're not 

25

asking us to muck around with that number because I

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't know what the consequences would be.  And if 

2

you're not, here's how we reduce it.  You give the same 

3

test six times and now we've reduced it from 5 percent, 

4

if he's above 70 all the time, to maybe one  one 

5

onehundredth of one percent.  Is that what you want to 

6

have happen? 

7
8
9
10
11
12

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, let me just, as to your 

latter point 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 
what I said? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

You are not right in some of 

the things you've said. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

15

right, which is 

16
17

The last thing you said is not 

No, no.  Let's go before 

the last thing. 
 (Laughter.) 

19

 MR. WAXMAN: 

21

Okay. 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

20

Am I right?  Am I right in 

Well, the last thing is 

important. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm not saying it isn't 

22

important, but I want  my thinking to the last thing 

23

is dependent on my being right on everything before the 

24

last thing.  So am I right before the last thing, about 

25

how 95 percent 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. WAXMAN: 

You are right that 95 percent 

2

is just a feature  is, generally speaking, a feature 

3

that is widely adopted as a confidence level, and it is 

4

particularly important here because the constitutional 

5

guarantee announced in Atkins is against the execution 

6

of persons with mental retardation.  And 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

On Justice Breyer's last 

8

point, before your  your time expires, because I do 

9

think this is important.  Is there not another way of 

10

proving reliability?  Suppose  what about multiple 

11

tests?  Suppose someone is given 25 Wechsler tests and 

12

24 times the person scores 76 and one time the person 

13

scores 72.  What would you deal with  how would you 

14

deal with that in a State that has a hard cutoff? 

15

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So, this is the last point that 

16

I wanted to get to, and I think if you  that the best 

17

thing I can  before my time runs out, I just want to 

18

point you to page 10, Footnote 3 of our reply brief, 

19

which cites the Oxford Handbook of, I don't know, 

20

Clinical Diagnosis or something, and we've given you the 

21

pages.  And on those pages, it explains why when you 

22

have a situation of somebody who takes more than one 

23

test, the appropriate determinant is very much not the 

24

average.  It is what's called the composite score.  And 

25

the composite score is different, and, in fact, for

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

people below the mean, below the average, because you 

2

have to take into account the fact that regression 

3

towards the mean and also, the fact that a person who 

4

takes two, three, or four tests, multiple tests, changes 

5

the bell curve of standard deviation. 

6

 So the example that's given in the Oxford 

7

Handbook is very similar to this case.  There were four 

8

tests.  They averaged at 72.  The composite score, and 

9

there's  there's a  there's a statistical 

10

explanation for how it's arrived at.  The composite 

11

score is 69, and the standard error of measurement is 

12

actually larger using a composite score. 

13

 So that's why, as to Justice Breyer's last 

14

point, simply averaging obtained scores does not, in 

15

fact, give you a better handle.  Because there are so 

16

few people who score significantly below the mean on 

17

multiple tests, what clinicians use is a statistical 

18

analysis that takes into account the different  the 

19

different calculation of what a standard deviation below 

20

the mean is. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's not consistent with 

22

my understanding of it, but I don't claim that I have a 

23

deep understanding of it.  But what  what would be 

24

your answer to my hypothetical?  Where there are 

25

multiple scores that are above the hard cutoff but one

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's below  and I will ask the State the opposite 

2

question  what would you do there? 

3
4
5
6
7

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, we know what Florida 

does, which 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what does the Eighth 

Amendment require, in your view? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, in our view, the Eighth 

8

Amendment requires that if a State chooses to use IQ 

9

test scores as a proxy for intellectual functioning 

10

rather than a full inquiry into intellectual 

11

functioning, it cannot refuse to employ the standard 

12

error of measurement that is inherent in the test. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And if it were 76, you 

14

would not need to go on to adaptive behavior; is that 

15

your view? 

16

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Our  our view is that a State 

17

consistent with Atkins could say that if you have no 

18

obtained score on a valid, properly administered, 

19

uptodate test that is 70  that is below 76, you 

20

may  you may constitutionally be precluded.  I think 

21

many clinicians would go ahead and do adaptive 

22

functioning and other intellectual functioning.  But our 

23

view is that States like Mississippi and Oklahoma that 

24

set 76 as the cutoff do, in fact, comply with Atkins. 

25

 May I save the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, counsel. 

2

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN WINSOR 

3

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

4

 MR. WINSOR: 

5

please the Court: 

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 This Court should affirm the decision of the 

7

Florida Supreme Court because it represents a reasonable 

8

legislative judgment and one that is fully consistent 

9

with Atkins and the Eighth Amendment.  I would like to 

10

start by responding to your question, Justice Alito, 

11

about what  what do you do with multiple scores.  And 

12

in fact in this case we're not talking about someone who 

13

had one or two IQ scores. 

14

 When you look at the Wechsler test, which is 

15

what the Petitioner contends is the gold standard, he 

16

had test scores of 71, 72, 73, 74 and 80.  And as we 

17

understand, what the Petitioner would have this Court do 

18

is to take some of those lower scores and simply 

19

subtract 5 points from them.  That is not consistent 

20

with  with the materials that he cited in the footnote 

21

in his brief.  If you look at the example there, they 

22

they do apply some statistical principles to a range of 

23

scores, but they do not simply take the lowest score and 

24

subtract 5 points from it. 

25

 And the logic of that, I would submit, is

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fairly obvious.  You couldn't have a situation where, 

2

take in this case, you have an  a low IQ on the 

3

Wechsler of 71 and a high IQ on the Wechsler of 80, and 

4

say at the same time that there is a 95 percent chance 

5

his score is between 75 and 85 and also a 95 percent 

6

chance that his score is between 66 and 76. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you want us to decide 

8

this case and establish the principle, the  the very 

9

significant principle that where you have a  a 

10

criminal defendant condemned to death for  for murder 

11

whose scores are 71, 72, 73, 74, and 80, that's okay? 

12

That's all you're trying to persuade us of? 

13

 I mean, I'm not very happy having to go 

14

through this in all future cases where you have somebody 

15

who has 69, 73, 74, 75, and 81.  I mean, don't you have 

16

some more general principle, other than the particular 

17

scores in this case are good enough. 

18

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, we certainly think the 

19

particular scores in this case are good enough.  But we 

20

do; we have a broader principle, which is that when you 

21

are dealing with things like mental diagnosis or things 

22

in the medical field generally, that there is good 

23

reason for this Court to do as it has historically, 

24

which is to defer to reasonable legislative judgments. 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So what 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, let  let me ask 

2

you this.  Suppose that the American Psychiatric 

3

Association and  and all other professional 

4

associations do use the SEM.  Suppose that.  It seems to 

5

me what the State is saying here in declining to use 

6

that, is that it declines to follow the standards that 

7

are set by the people that designed and administer and 

8

interpret the tests. 

9

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, I have two responses to 

10

that.  One, if the constitutional rule  which we 

11

submit it's not  but if there were a constitutional 

12

rule that the Eighth Amendment required Florida to adopt 

13

all kinds of  of clinical criteria that the APA or the 

14

AAIDD 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

This is not clinical; 

16

this is statistical criteria with the tests you're 

17

relying on. 

18

 MR. WINSOR: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, there's two parts 
You keep saying 

20

clinical, but the SEM is not a clinical judgment.  It's 

21

a standard error of measurement.  That's the test 

22

maker's. 

23

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, that's right, but Justice 

24

Kennedy's question as I understood it was how can 

25

Florida deviate from what the DSM and what the AAIDD

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

suggest are best practices.  And my 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No.  This has nothing to 

3

do with best practices.  It has to do with what the test 

4

givers say is the right way to look at their tests. 

5

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, the  the test measures 

6

published the error measurement; but it's the DSM and 

7

the AAIDD that are suggesting how many deviations that 

8

you should 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, no.  They're not 

10

challenging the two standard deviations; they're saying 

11

if you are going to preclude functioning abilities and 

12

the other two factors of your test based on a score of a 

13

test that says it has an SEM of 5, then you have to use 

14

the SEM.  It's very different.  They're not saying you 

15

have to take that number and declare that person 

16

mentally/intellectually challenged.  You just have to 

17

apply the other factors. 

18

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, it's a threeprong test, 

19

so in any instance you would have to demonstrate the 

20

existence of all three prongs.  But with respect to the 

21

 the 95 percent interval, that 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

23

 MR. WINSOR: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

Can I stop you there? 
Yes, certainly. 
I thought that you don't 

have to go to, under your view, you don't have to go to

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the second and third standards if you  on the first, 

2

it's 70 or below.  I thought that adaptive behavior 

3

doesn't come into the picture, and onset doesn't come 

4

into the picture, if the IQ is above 70. 

5

 MR. WINSOR: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

6

There  it's a threepart test, and the medical 

7

community doesn't dispute that and the Petitioner 

8

doesn't dispute that, that to achieve a diagnosis of 

9

mental retardation you would have to demonstrate that 

10
11

you meet each of the three criteria. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So what is wrong  this 

12

there may be agreement among you on this.  What the 

13

what Atkins says is there are three parts, as you say. 

14

One part is significantly subaverage intellectual 

15

functioning.  That's the first part.  And so what you 

16

say is, if it's above a 70 on an IQ test, or a couple of 

17

them, that's the end of it.  We don't go further.  All 

18

right.  What they say is, I want to tell the jury 

19

something, or the judge if the judge is deciding it: 

20

"Judge, I have an expert here.  Thank you." 

21
22
23

 Expert: 

"I want to tell you, Your Honor, 

that that number 70 is subject to error." 
 It could be  and indeed the State can do 

24

the same thing.  If it's 68, the number 68 is subject to 

25

error.  So if somebody measures 68 you could bring in

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the witness, and you would say 5 percent of the time, 

2

it's within 5 points either way. 

3

 I think that's all they want to do. 

Now, 

4

there could be other ways of going about it, and maybe 

5

you would give the same test six times with different 

6

questions, and that may not eliminate but it might 

7

reduce the possibility of error, or there may be some 

8

other way to do it.  You call in a psychiatrist and he 

9

says okay; or an expert:  72, he's still.  We have other 

10
11

ways.  We have other ways, not just tests. 
 Now, I think you would do the same thing if 

12

you wanted to, on the down side, I guess.  And that 

13

might lead people not to  to being executed.  You see? 

14

And that's their position, though, I think.  And they 

15

get to do it on the upside.  All right, what's wrong 

16

with that?  It doesn't sound so terrible. 

17

 And anyway, the Eighth Amendment  this is 

18

a way of enforcing the Eighth Amendment.  This doesn't 

19

need to be, I don't think, an independent Eighth 

20

Amendment violation. 

21
22
23

 But go ahead; that's the kind of question I 
would love to have some 
 MR. WINSOR: 

Sure.  Well, what is wrong with 

24

that is that substantially, if you raise the limit to 75 

25

as Mr. Waxman suggested you could, that doubles 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It doesn't raise the limit 

2

to 75.  What it does is it says just what I said, and I 

3

don't want to repeat it.  When it's there at 70, they 


4


call their expert, who informs the decisionmaker just 


5


what I said.  Now, that would take a little time, maybe 

6

15 minutes, maybe a little longer.  But that's what they 

7

want to do, I think.  And  and why not?  I mean, what 

8

is so terrible about doing it? 

9

 MR. WINSOR: 

What is so terrible about doing 

10

it is you would end up increasing the proportion of 

11

people, the number of people who would be eligible for a 

12

mental retardation finding. 

13

But only those who in fact 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

are mentally retarded. 

15

 MR. WINSOR: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MR. WINSOR: 

No.  No, Your Honor. 
Because? 
They're not mentally  there 

18

is no disagreement that 70 is the appropriate threshold 

19

here.  So this is almost an evidentiary matter.  It's a 

20

matter of what does it take to prove by clear and 

21

convincing evidence, which is a standard of proof that 

22

they have as a matter of Florida law.  And it's a 

23

standard of proof they do not challenge in this case. 

24

And all Florida recognizes is that the best measure of 

25

your true IQ is your obtained IQ test score.  And so for

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

someone who 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, General, the ultimate 

3

determination here is whether somebody is mentally 

4

retarded; and the IQ test is just a part of that.  It's 

5

a part of one prong of that ultimate determination.  And 

6

what your cutoff does is it essentially says the inquiry 

7

has to stop there.  And the question is how is that at 

8

all consistent with anything we ever say when it comes 

9

to the death penalty?  Because we have this whole line 

10

of cases that says when it comes to meting out the death 

11

penalty, we actually do individualized consideration, 

12

and we allow people to make their best case about why 

13

they're not eligible for the death penalty.  And 

14

essentially what your cutoff does is it stops that in 

15

its tracks, as to a person who may or may not even have 

16

a true IQ of over 70, and let alone it stops people in 

17

their tracks who may not be mentally  who may be 

18

mentally retarded. 

19

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, first, with respect to 

20

the mitigation, this is  this Atkins hearing in 

21

Florida is completely separate from the mitigation 

22

phase, and so he does still have individualized 

23

decisionmaking with respect to whether to  to have a 

24

death sentence, and he's still had an opportunity to 

25

present all evidence 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But he doesn't have it with 

2

respect to this critical question, right?  We've said 

3

you cannot execute somebody who is mentally retarded; 

4

and he says now you are preventing me from showing you 

5

that you're mentally retarded, because you have an IQ 

6

test, a part of one prong of the threeprong test, you 

7

have an IQ test that says that I'm not mentally 

8

retarded, but you know, that IQ test may be wrong.  It's 

9

not  given that you are not using a margin of error. 

10

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, with respect to the IQ 

11

test just being one part of the intellectual functioning 

12

prong, that is a very recent development and one of the 

13

 one of the problems we have with the idea of 

14

constitutionalizing medical criteria is that it is 

15

changing.  If you look at the DSMIV which was in  in 

16

existence at the time of Atkins  the DSDMV replaced 

17

it last year  they said that intellectual functioning, 

18

the prong was defined by IQ as measured on test scores.

factors to be considered, do we?  Would  would the 

23

State have been able to refute his assertion of mental 

24

retardation by pointing to the fact that he is the one 

25

who seized the young woman, who pushed her into a car,

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

who drove the car with his accomplice following in 

2

another car, and who killed her, and  and killed 

3

another  and killed a policeman, too, later, I guess. 

4

 MR. WINSOR: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, sir. 
Could the State bring that 

6

in and say somebody who is mentally retarded enough 

7

so mentally retarded as not to be responsible and not to 

8

be subject to the death penalty certainly could not have 

9

pulled all of this off.  This is not a person who is 

10

that mentally retarded, significantly mental  mentally 

11

retarded. 

12

 Could the State show that 

13

 MR. WINSOR: 

14

 JUSTICE SCLIA: 

15
16

Well, the State certainly 
 in refutation of  of 

his mental retardation evidence? 
 MR. WINSOR: 

Only adaptive functioning is a 

17

portion of the test.  So there's a threeprong test. 

18

The intellectual functioning, which historically has 

19

been all about IQ until very recently.  And then 

20

adaptive functioning talks about how people react in the 

21

ordinary world to  to difficult situations, and some 

22

of what you talked about may or may not be relevant to 

23

that. 

24
25

 But further responding to the earlier 
question, it's not that Florida is not allowing evidence

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that you meet prong one.  It's that Florida is making a 

2

finding that you cannot satisfy prong one and so that's 

3

why you don't know the 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But it seems to me that, 

5

to follow from Justice Kagan's question, and I think 

6

this is a very important question, that we've been 

7

talking about here about the  the inaccuracy, to some 

8

extent, of IQ scores, and your rule prevents us from 

9

getting a better understanding of whether that IQ score 

10

is  is accurate or not because you  we cannot even 

11

reach the adaptive functioning prong.  You prevent it at 

12

the outset.  And incidentally, you don't prevent it if 

13

it's under 65  under 70, do you? 

14

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, it's a threeprong test. 

15

So you'd have to satisfy all three.  But with respect to 

16

your question about whether adaptive functioning 

17

evidence can affect the reading of the IQ, we submit 

18

that's not  that's not the case.  That's why they're 

19

discrete inquiries.  And so if you have multiple test 

20

scores or if you have one test score 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But in very close cases, 

22

doesn't it illuminate whether or not the IQ test is 

23

exactly as reported or if it is subject to some decrease 

24

or increase depending on what the evidence of adaptive 

25

functioning shows.

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. WINSOR: 

No, Your Honor.  That would be 

2

the position of the modern DSM, but that's a radical 

3

departure from where it has been historically.  Again, 

4

it used to define the intellectual functioning prong as 

5

being determined exclusively 

6
7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 
read Atkins again. 

8

 MR. WINSOR: 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

10
11

Well, I'll read  I'll 

Yes, sir. 
But I thought Atkins 

did  did refer to the adaptive functioning. 
 MR. WINSOR: 

Oh, no.  Make no mistake, there 

12

is an adaptive functioning inquiry.  That's one of the 

13

three prongs.  And so you have to prove intellectual 

14

functioning, you have to prove adaptive functioning. 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that was even under 

DSMIV, correct? 
 MR. WINSOR: 

Oh, yes, sir.  That's been a a 

18

part  that's been a part for  for decades.  What is 

19

changing is the way the medical community looks at how 

20

to measure IQ or what to do with IQ.  And so the 

21

modern 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, General, at the very 

23

least, you give somebody an IQ test, he scores a 71. 

24

Now, he might actually have an IQ of 71, or we know from 

25

the way these standard margins of error work, he might

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have an IQ of 69, and you won't let him go to the 

2

adaptive behavior prong of the test and show that, you 

3

know, and  and show that he can't function in society 

4

in the ways that Atkins seems to care about, as Justice 

5

Kennedy says, notwithstanding that this IQ score number 

6

might be accurate or might not be. 

7

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, the adaptive functioning 

8

is a critical component, but even the guidelines that 

9

DSM would agree, that no matter what your deficits are 

10

in adaptive functioning, you do not qualify for a mental 

11

retardation diagnosis without also showing substantial 

12

deficits in intellectual functioning. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Since when  I know 

14

that there's less emphasis now on the IQ test than there 

15

was before.  But when the IQ test was used, did they 

16

always use it as a fixed number or did they always 

17

include the SEM as informing the clinical judgment? 

18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

 MR. WINSOR: 

Oh, the SEM has been  has 

been part of the equation, yes.  I'm not disputing that. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Since then they have not 

changed. 
 MR. WINSOR: 

We're not disputing that, but 

again 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's been the same in 

all medical diagnosis.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, I think that the  the 

2

application of the SEM has been a component of this for 

3

some time.  We don't dispute that.  We do note that the 

4

emphasis on IQ is  is decreasing and that the medical 

5

community is now suggesting that you should rely less 

6

and less on IQ and they've changed 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

They're not arguing for 

8

that.  They're just arguing that we should stay where 

9

it's always been, which is using the SEM. 

10

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, I think what they're 

11

arguing is that you should  you should do this, you 

12

should apply the SEM in the same way that clinicians do 

13

because that's the way the clinicians do it.  And if you 

14

go down that road, then it is very difficult to 

15

understand in a principled way where  where that would 

16

stop. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is it the case that those 

18

who use IQ tests always require a 95 percent confidence 

19

level and always must require a 95 percent confidence 

20

level?  Let's suppose a school on the other end of the 

21

IQ scale wants to identify gifted children and they say 

22

a child is gifted if the child has an IQ of 130 or 

23

above.  So they say if you have an obtained score of 

24

130, you're in.  You're in the gifted child program, 

25

even though there is the same percentage that would

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be  would be the case with respect to someone with an 

2

IQ of 70, that really the person is below 130.  Would 

3

there be something wrong with their doing that? 

4

 MR. WINSOR: 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

6
7

No, Your Honor. 
Do they  are there places 

that do that? 
 MR. WINSOR: 

Oh, certainly.  That's up to 

8

the decisionmaker who is relying on the IQ for whatever 

9

the purpose he or she is.  There is an SEM that's 

10

published that's a part of the  of the test, but the 

11

decisionmaker who's relying on an IQ test score, to take 

12

your example about someone in a school, they can set 

13

that as high or low as they want to, because they might 

14

want to be overinclusive, they might want to be 

15

particularly restrictive. 

16

 And that's one of the areas where, what 

17

we're dealing with here in the Atkins context is 

18

fundamentally different because we have an adversarial 

19

process, at least with respect to contested cases.  We 

20

have a burden of proof, a clear and convincing evidence 

21

burden of proof that's not shared in the clinical 

22

setting. 

23

 And so there are a lot of reasons why it's 

24

very different to make a diagnosis in a clinical 

25

setting, particularly now where the emphasis in the

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

medical community is on providing services or making 

2

services available to people where you don't have the 

3

same disincentive to be overinclusive that 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

5

 MR. WINSOR: 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

General. 
Yes. 
Could the State change its 

7

statute to say we're  we're now using a threshold of 

8

60? 

9

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, the State certainly has 

10

substantial leeway.  I think the answer to that is yes, 

11

although it would be  it would be more difficult to 

12

defend because I think what you'd want to do is go back 

13

and look at the consensus that  that was a part of 

14

Atkins, the consensus that supported the decision in 

15

Atkins. 

16

 But I think before making a decision on 60 

17

as a threshold or some other number, you'd want to look 

18

at the whole picture 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I guess I don't 

20

understand it.  You have to explain that to me a little 

21

bit. 

22

 MR. WINSOR: 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Sure. 
Because I thought that the 

24

70 was  is very longstanding.  Everybody has agreed 

25

that it's  it's 70 for many, many decades.  Maybe 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

maybe forever.  So how could a State  if the State 

2

why could the State say no to that?  What would you look 

3

at? 

4

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, I think you'd look at, 

5

again, at the  the special interest at issue in Atkins 

6

and  and the fact that the State may need to be more 

7

restrictive because of the  the malingering and  and 

8

incentives that inmates would have to  to score lower 

9

than they  than they would ordinarily perform at, that 

10

you wouldn't have in a clinical setting or you wouldn't 

11

have in  necessarily in a school setting where people 

12

are always trying to perform 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

other two prongs. 

15

 MR. WINSOR: 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17

other two prongs. 

18

 MR. WINSOR: 

19
20

That's why you have the 

I'm sorry? 
That's why you have the 

Well, you have  you certainly 

have 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And at every juncture 

21

when you have a fixed cutoff, you have the ability to 

22

defeat the other two prongs, but you're stopping them on 

23

a test based on a test score that has a margin of error 

24

recognized by the designers of the test. 

25

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, we're not stopping them

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

from putting on  all we're stopping is the 

2

consideration of the other prongs when it's clear that 

3

the first prong can't be  can't be satisfied.  So I 

4

think there's been, in the briefing, this idea that it 

5

necessarily has to be sequenced a certain way, and it 

6

doesn't.  If someone came in and it were undisputed that 

7

he could not satisfy the adaptive functioning prong, for 

8

example, then you wouldn't necessarily have to look at 

9

IQ.  So 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

12

 MR. WINSOR: 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Can you 
Please, I 
Yes, sir. 
Then I misunderstand the 

14

case.  I thought the Florida court held, in effect, my 

15

words, that the IQ was a threshold in order to make this 

16

inquiry, and if you had 70  over 70, you could not 

17

make a showing.  But please correct me if I'm wrong. 

18

 MR. WINSOR: 

No, that  that's  that's 

19

correct.  And what happened in this case was there was 

20

a  a motion in limine by the State recognizing that 

21

the  that the IQ scores that were at issue here were 

22

all above 70.  And so it was sort of an ordinary 

23

evidentiary motion, you know, if you had a different 

24

case where you had to prove causation of damages if 

25

there was no evidence 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you do not get  if 

2

you do not satisfy prong one, you do not get to prongs 

3

two or three, period.  Right? 

4

 MR. WINSOR: 

That's right, Your Honor.  But 

5

by the same token, if you don't satisfy prong two, you 

6

wouldn't get to prong three and  and so on.  So 

7

it's  the evidentiary ruling was certainly a  simply 

8

a recognition that you have to satisfy. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What happens if right now, 

10

today, under the law of Florida a similar case and there 

11

is an IQ score of 71, and the prosecutor points out to 

12

the judge that that's higher than 70.  And the defense 

13

lawyer says:  Your Honor, I would like to bring in my 

14

test expert here who will explain to you that, even 

15

though this test did show 71, there is some fairly small 

16

but significant probability of error, and it could in 

17

fact be as high as 76, and he would like to explain to 

18

you that that's the situation.  And therefore, can I 

19

have him testify. 

20
21
22

 Does the judge have to let him testify or 
not? 
 MR. WINSOR: 

If I understand the 

23

hypothetical correctly, you have one test score of  of 

24

71, and so without an attained test score of 70 or 

25

below, he would not.

44

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 MR. WINSOR: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  So then 
But he would have 
So then this is a dispute 

4

in the case.  They would like to present that expert, 

5

you would say no?

8
9
10

That's right. 
Okay.  That brings me 

back to my  I just want to be sure. 
 MR. WINSOR: 

Yes.  But 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Then we get to my first 

11

question, which I won't repeat, and this man has been on 

12

death row for over 35 years, I take it? 

13
14
15

 MR. WINSOR: 

Yes, sir.  1978 was the  was 

the  was the act. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

He didn't raise mental 

16

retardation until 10 years after his first conviction; 

17

isn't that right? 

18

 MR. WINSOR: 

That's right, Your Honor. 

19

He  he raised it in the Hitchcock setting in the late 

20

'80s and then went back and had some of the same 

21

evidence that he's relying on 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How has it gone on this 

long?  1978 is when he killed this woman. 
 MR. WINSOR: 

There have been a number of 

appeals in this case.  There have been a number of

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

issues raised, and there was a  but yes, there is 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

3

 MR. WINSOR: 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  but, General 
Yes, sir. 
The  the last ten people 

5

Florida has executed have spent an average of 24.9 years 

6

on death row. 

7

 Do you think that that is consistent with 

8

the purposes of the death penalty, and is  is it 

9

consistent with sound administration of the justice 

10
11

system? 
 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, I certainly think it's 

12

consistent with the Constitution, and I think that there 

13

are obvious 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15

 MR. WINSOR: 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That wasn't my question. 
Oh, I'm sorry, I apologize. 
Is it consistent with 

17

the  with the purposes that the death penalty is 

18

designed to serve, and is it consistent with an orderly 

19

administration of justice? 

20
21

 MR. WINSOR: 

It's consistent with the 

with the 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

23

 MR. WINSOR: 

24
25

Go ahead. 
It is consistent with the 

purposes of the death penalty certainly. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:

should ask us

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

10
11

 that question, 

inasmuch 

5

7

Well 

Well 
 as most of the delay has 

been because of rules that we have imposed. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, let  let  let me 

ask  ask this.  Of course most of the delay is at 
the hands of the defendant. 
 In this case it was 5 years before there was 

12

a hearing on the  on the Atkins question.  Has the 

13

attorney general of Florida suggested to the legislature 

14

any  any measures, any provisions, any statutes, to 

15

expedite the consideration of these cases. 

16

 MR. WINSOR: 

Your Honor, there was a statute 

17

enacted last session, last spring, that is  it's 

18

called the Timely Justice Act, that addresses a number 

19

of issues that you raise, and it's presently being 

20

challenged in front of the Florida Supreme Court. 

21

 But I would like to talk about the 95 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

23

 MR. WINSOR: 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

 MR. WINSOR: 

General, can I just ask 
Certainly. 
 why you have this policy? 
I'm sorry?

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Why you have the policy.  I 

2

mean, is it administrative convenience?  Just tell me 

3

why you have the policy. 

4

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, the people of Florida 

5

have decided that the death penalty is an appropriate 

6

punishment for the most horrific crimes, like the crime 

7

at issue. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

the 70 threshold. 

10

 MR. WINSOR: 

No, no, no.  Why you have 

Well, that  that's what I was 

11

getting at.  And that  and so Florida has an interest 

12

in ensuring that the people who evade execution because 

13

of mental retardation are people who are, in fact, 

14

mentally retarded.  And if we apply the rule that the 

15

Petitioner has suggested, it would double the number of 

16

people who are eligible for the  for the punish  or 

17

for the  for the exemption.  And that's inconsistent 

18

with Florida's purposes of  of the death penalty. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, that's just to say 

20

that it would double the number of people eligible, but 

21

some of them may be mentally retarded.  I mean, 

22

presumably we want accurate decisionmaking with respect 

23

to this question, don't we? 

24
25

 MR. WINSOR: 

Well, there  there  we do 

certainly.  And they are not mentally retarded if they

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't have an IQ of 70 or below.  And that's a  that's 

2

a position that Petitioner doesn't  doesn't challenge. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Who are not mentally 

4

retarded if they don't have an IQ score of 70 or below? 

5

I mean, you  you don't believe that yourself, right? 

6

This is a tool to decide whether somebody is mentally 

7

retarded, and it's a tool that functions in one prong of 

8

a threeprong test. 

9

 MR. WINSOR: 

It is the first prong.  The IQ 

10

threshold is the first prong.  So  no matter what your 

11

adaptive deficits are, you must demonstrate  and, 

12

again, here in this adversary setting, you must 

13

demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that you 

14

have an IQ of 70 or below. 

15

 And what we believe is that if you say, 

16

Well, there is a 95 percent chance that my IQ is 

17

somewhere between, say, 68 and 78, that you have not 

18

satisfied that first prong. 

19

 And I would like to talk about the 95 

20

percent confidence interval, because it is not the case 

21

that you have, say, with a 72 a 95 percent chance that 

22

your IQ is 70 or below.  In fact, it's a very small 

23

chance. 

24
25

 What the  what the confidence interval 
measures is that you have a 95 percent chance that your

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

true IQ is within five points of the measured thing, the 

2

measured IQ, but it's not that you would have an equal 

3

chance of having a 66, a 67, a 68.  It falls under the 

4

bell curve. 

5

 And so if you take the test over and over 

6

again, you are going to score near the  near the peak 

7

of that bell curve most of the time, which is where your 

8

true IQ would be.  And at the outer ends of that 95 

9

percent threshold are very, very small likelihoods that 

10

you  that that's your true IQ. 

11

 And  and then with each additional test 

12

you take, the odds  that  that's above 70, the odds 

13

would go down. 

14

 And so it's simply not the case that you can 

15

say, Well, he has a 72 so he has satisfied or even might 

16

have satisfied the first prong because, as a statistical 

17

matter, every  well, as a factual matter, every 

18

Wechsler test he has taken that was admitted into 

19

evidence was over 70.  He had a 71, a 72, 73, 74, and an 

20

80. 

21

 And so if you want to apply statistics to 

22

it, you would have to look and say, well, what are 

23

the  what are the odds that with that group of 

24

testing, that his true IQ is under 70? 

25

 Now, is it possible? 

Certainly it is

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

possible that it's over 100.  You know, you can exceed 

2

beyond the 95 percent confidence interval. 

3

 And nobody disputes that  that the true IQ 

4

is something that is incapable of being measured or 

5

incapable of  and  but  but the IQ test is what 

6

the community has, and it's the most objective of the 

7

three prongs, which is why we believe it's particularly 

8

important to focus on because it's the most objective 

9

test that we have. 

10

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How many States retain 

that practice with a rigid 70 cutoff? 
 MR. WINSOR: 

Your Honor, by our count there

are eight States that have both a hard cutoff and a 

14

and a 70 or two standard deviations, which approximates 

15

to the same thing, that has been expressly recognized by 

16

the States.  There are a number of other States that 

17

have statutes similar to Florida's, but that have not 

18

been interpreted one way or the other that  that we 

19

may or may not 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Of those eight, how many 

21

actually have a fixed cutoff and how many have a SEM?  I 

22

thought it was only four that didn't have consideration. 

23

 MR. WINSOR: 

No, no.  Those eight, Your 

24

Honor, all have a fixed cutoff of 70 or two standard 

25

two standard deviations.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But by judicial 

2

decision, they've considered  well, we  that 

3

that's something that 

4

 MR. WINSOR: 

In  in most of the instances, 

5

Your Honor, they have done what Florida has done, which 

6

is they've had a statute that then was interpreted by 

7

the  by the courts. 

8

 So we 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Exactly.  That's what 

10

I'm saying.  Only four have it interpreted without the 

11

SEM. 

12

 MR. WINSOR: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

I'm  I apologize. 
I thought only four had 

interpreted without using the SEM? 

15

 MR. WINSOR: 

16

without using the SEM? 

Had interpreted their statutes 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MR. WINSOR: 

Only four, like Florida. 
No, Your Honor, we have eight. 

19

We have Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, North 

20

Carolina, and Virginia, and Maryland, which has repealed 

21

the death penalty, but  but that was their standard 

22

when they have it. 

23

 We would ask respectfully that the Court 

24

affirm the Florida Supreme Court.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH WAXMAN 

3
4

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

In State v. Cherry, which is 

5

the  the Florida Supreme Court decision that 

6

established this rule that if you  if your lowest 

7

score or your only score is 71, you are out, and that 

8

applies whether you take one test or multiple tests 

9

here I'm quoting from the Supreme Court's decision in 

10

Cherry, that, quote, "It is a universally accepted 

11

given, that is that the SEM is a universally accepted 

12

given, and as such should logically be considered in 

13

determining whether a defendant has mental retardation." 

14

 What the Court said was: 

We have to read 

15

the plain meaning of the Florida statute and the Florida 

16

statute says two standard deviations. 

17

 The notion that the Florida legislature or 

18

the  may I finish my sentence  the Florida 

19

legislature or the people of Florida have made a 

20

considered decision not to account for the SEM is 

21

baseless and is belied by the  the legislative report 

22

that accompanies the statute which said 70 to 75. 

23

 Thank you. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

Mr. Waxman, counsel.
