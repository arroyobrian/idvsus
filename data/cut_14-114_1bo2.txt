 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 14114, King v. Burwell. 

5

 Mr. Carvin.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN 

7

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 

8

 MR. CARVIN: 

9

please the Court: 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 This is a straightforward case of statutory 

11

construction where the plain language of the statute 

12

dictates the result. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Carvin, will you 

14

please back up, because before we get to a question of 

15

statutory construction, as you know, each plaintiff, or 

16

at least one plaintiff, has to have a concrete stake in 

17

these questions.  They can't put them as ideological 

18

questions. 

19

 And we have as  four plaintiffs. 

As to 

20

two of them, there is a declaration stating "I am not 

21

eligible for health insurance from the government," but 

22

there's a question of whether they are veterans eligible 

23

for coverage as veterans. 

24
25

 MR. CARVIN: 

Yes.  One of those is Mr. Hurst 

who would have to, if  I would refer you to Joint

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Appendix at PAGE 42, where this is the government's 

2

recitation of facts where they make it clear that 

3

Mr. Hurst would have to spend $750 of his own money as 

4

a  because of the IRS rule. 

5

 Mr. Hurst was a veteran for 10 months in 

6

1970.  He is not eligible for any veterans service 

7

because if you've served such a short  health 

8

services.  If you serve such a short

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I  I'll ask the 

government if they agree that 
 MR. CARVIN: 

And I should point out that the 

government has never disputed this, and I'd also like 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the Court has an 

obligation to look into it on its own. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

That's true, but of course 

16

there has been factfinding by lower courts in an 

17

adversarial system.  I don't believe the Court does its 

18

own 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I don't think it was ever 

20

brought up in the lower court that these  these two 

21

people were veterans. 

22

 MR. CARVIN: 

If I could just make one 

23

further point on this, Justice Ginsburg.  Even if he 

24

were technically eligible, which he is not, there is an 

25

IRS Rule 26 C.F.R. 1.36B2(c)(ii), which says 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MR. CARVIN: 

Ah, yes. 
With the usual clarity of the 

3

IRS code, making clear that you are only disabled from 

4

receiving subsidies if you have actually enrolled in a 

5

veteran's health services and it's undisputed that 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Unless That's the government 

7

that's 

8

 MR. CARVIN: 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 Mr. Hurst did not. 
 that's their position too. 

10

And then there were the two women, I think one of them 

11

was going to turn 65 in June, which would make her 

12

Medicaideligible. 

13

 MR. CARVIN: 

She will turn 65 in late June. 

14

She's obviously subject to the individual mandate well 

15

in advance of that.  By virtue of the IRS rule, she 

16

would have to spend $1800 per year for health insurance 

17

by virtue of the IRS 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

19

 MR. CARVIN: 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

21

Excuse me? 

 MR. CARVIN: 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

But you said she will 

turn 65 in June. 

22

24

Per year? 

Late June, yes. 
So that takes care of 

2015. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

No.  Right now she is obliged

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

under the individual mandate to have insurance.  You 

2

you have to have insurance for 9 months of the year and 

3

so as of April 1st 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

5

 MR. CARVIN: 

6
7
8
9

Then 
 she will be subject to the 

penalty which will be alleviated only by 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Again, I'll ask the 

government if they agree with you on that. 
 And then I think for the fourth plaintiff, 

10

there's a question whether she would qualify for a 

11

hardship  hardship exemption from the individual 

12

mandate even if she received the tax credit, in which 

13

case the tax credits would be irrelevant. 

14

 MR. CARVIN: 

That's true.  Again, I'll refer 

15

you to the Joint Appendix at 41.  That was the 

16

government's argument below.  We didn't want to get into 

17

a factual dispute about it because we had such clear 

18

standing with respect 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

20

 MR. CARVIN: 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

22

 to 
But you would have to 

establish the standing, prove the standing. 

23

 MR. CARVIN: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

Yeah, but you have to 

Well, as 
If this gets beyond the 

opening door.

Alderson Reporting Company

7
1

 MR. CARVIN: 

Fair enough, Your Honor, but 

2

but it's blackletter law that only one plaintiff needs 

3

standing, and for the reasons I've already articulated, 

4

both Plaintiff Hurst and Plaintiff Levy have standing. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Okay.  I don't want to 

6

detain you on this any more but I will ask the 

7

government what their position is on standing. 

8

 MR. CARVIN: 

9

 Returning to the merits, the only provision 

10

in the Act which either authorizes or limits subsidies 

11

says, in plain English, that the subsidies are only 

12

available through an exchange established by the State 

13

under Section 1311. 

14

Thank you. 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If you're going to 

15

elaborate on that, I would appreciate your  in your 

16

elaboration, I've read that, and this statute is like 

17

the tax code more than it's like the Constitution. 

18

There are defined terms, and the words you just used 

19

concern a defined term. 

20

 As I read the definition, there's a section, 

21

Definitions, and it says, quote, The term "Exchange" 

22

means, quote, an exchange established under 1311.  And 

23

1311 says, An Exchange shall be a government agency, 

24

et cetera, that is established by a State.  Those are 

25

the definitions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

 So then you look to 1321. 

And 1321 says, if 

2

a State does not set up that Exchange, then the Federal, 

3

quote, secretary shall establish and operate such 

4

Exchange. 

5

 So it says, "The Secretary is to establish 

6

and operate such Exchange," the only kind of Exchange to 

7

which the Act refers, which is an  quote, "an Exchange 

8

established by a State under 1311."  That's the 

9

definition. 

10
11

 So the statute tells the Secretary, set up 
such Exchange, namely, a 1311 State Exchange. 

12

 MR. CARVIN: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

Correct. 

this statute. 

15

 MR. CARVIN: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17
18
19

And there's nothing else in 

Correct. 
So that's throughout what 

they're talking about.  So what's the problem? 
 MR. CARVIN: 

As Your Honor just said, it 

tells the Secretary to establish such Exchange. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MR. CARVIN: 

Yes. 
And what 36B turns on is 

22

whether the State or the Secretary has established the 

23

Exchange. 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, it uses the same 

terminology that it's used in  15 times in this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

statute, namely, the terminology in the definition is 

2

"an Exchange established by a State." 

3

 MR. CARVIN: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

 MR. CARVIN: 

Under 
That's the phrase. 
Well, under 1311, that is the 

6

phrase.  And if 1311 created some  the definitional 

7

section created some ambiguity as to whether HHS was 

8

establishing a 1311 or 1321 Exchange, that is immaterial 

9

because 36B does not say all 1311 Exchanges get 

10

subsidies, it says Exchanges established by the State 

11

under Section 1311 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

13

 MR. CARVIN: 

14

 not established by HHS under 

Section 1311 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

16

 MR. CARVIN: 

17
18

Mr. Carvin. 

Mr. Carvin. 
 so it eliminates any 

potential ambiguity created by the definitional section. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can  can I offer you a 

19

sort of simple daily life kind of example which I think 

20

is linguistically equivalent to what the sections here 

21

say that Justice Breyer was talking about? 

22

 So I have three clerks, Mr. Carvin. 

Their 

23

names are Will and Elizabeth and Amanda.  Okay?  So my 

24

first clerk, I say, Will, I'd like you to write me a 

25

memo.  And I say, Elizabeth, I want you to edit Will's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

memo once he's done.  And then I say, Amanda, listen, if 

2

Will is too busy to write the memo, I want you to write 

3

such memo. 

4

 Now, my question is: 

If Will is too busy to 

5

write the memo and Amanda has to write such memo, should 

6

Elizabeth edit the memo? 

7

 (Laughter.) 

8

 MR. CARVIN: 

9

If you're going to create 

moneys to Will for writing the memo and Amanda writes 

10

the memo and you say, the money will go if Will writes 

11

the memo, then under plain English and common sense, no, 

12

when Amanda writes the memo 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

14

 MR. CARVIN: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

16

Gosh 
 but now 
 you  you run a 

different shop than I do if that's the way 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Because in my chambers, if 

19

Elizabeth did not edit the memo, Elizabeth would not be 

20

performing her function.  In other words, there's a 

21

a substitute, and I've set up a substitute.  And then 

22

I've given  I've given instructions:  Elizabeth, you 

23

write  you edit Will's memo, but of course if Amanda 

24

writes the memo, the instructions carry over.  Elizabeth 

25

knows what she's supposed to do.  She's supposed to edit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1
2

Amanda's memo, too. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

And  and in your chambers, 

3

you're agnostic as to whether Will, Elizabeth or Amanda 

4

writes it.  But the key point is here under Section 

5

1311, Congress was not agnostic as to whether States or 

6

HHS established the Exchange.  It's 

7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, Mr. Carvin, if I had 

those clerks, I had the same clerks 
 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

 and Amanda wrote the 

11

memo, and I received it and I said, This is a great 

12

memo, who wrote it?  Would the answer be it was written 

13

by Will, because Amanda stepped into Will's shoes? 

14

 MR. CARVIN: 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

17

 MR. CARVIN: 

That was my first answer. 

He's good, Justice Alito. 
Justice Kagan didn't accept it, 

18

so I'm going to the second answer, which is you are 

19

agnostic as between Will and Amanda, but this 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

21

 MR. CARVIN: 

22
23

Ah, but that's 
But Congress was not agnostic 

as between State and Federal Exchanges. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  That's a very 

24

important point, I think, because what you're saying is 

25

that the answer to the question really does depend on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

context, and it depends on an understanding of the law 

2

as a whole and whether they were agnostic.  I agree with 

3

that. 

4

 So it's not the simple four or five words 

5

because the four or five words in my example, it's 

6

obvious that Elizabeth should edit the memo.  It's the 

7

whole structure and context of the provision that 

8

suggests whether those instructions carry over to the 

9

substitute, isn't it? 

10

 MR. CARVIN: 

We implore you to examine these 

11

words in the context of the Act as a whole because our 

12

argument becomes stronger for five reasons. 

13

 To respond to Justice Breyer's point, he 

14

says such Exchange connotes that it's the same person 

15

doing it.  But look at the provision on territorial 

16

Exchanges.  It says, territories can establish such 

17

Exchanges and then it says, "and shall be treated as a 

18

State."  So  so 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, it does.  But you say 

20

connote.  No, it's not a question of connotation; it is 

21

a question of denotation.  Now what does that mean?  It 

22

means that the Federal government, the Secretary, is 

23

establishing a thing for the State.  And what is the 

24

thing?  The thing that it is establishing for the State 

25

is defined as an Exchange established by the State.

Alderson Reporting Company

13
1

 MR. CARVIN: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

To 
Now, that person from Mars, 

3

who's literal, which I usually am not, but a literalist, 

4

I think would have to read it that way.  But if you 

5

if you're not a literalist, well, at least you could 

6

read it that way. 

7

 Now you want to go into the context  if 

8

you want to go into the context, at that point it seems 

9

to me your argument really is weaker. 

10

 MR. CARVIN: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, two points. 
The Exchanges fall apart, 

12

nobody can buy anything on them.  You know the 

13

arguments.  You've read the briefs.  Nobody can  there 

14

are no customers.  Employers don't have to pay penalties 

15

as long as they use just people from Virginia, but one 

16

Maryland person comes  you know all those arguments. 

17

So how does the context support you? 

18

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, again, under the 

19

literalist or nonliteralist interpretation, saying that 

20

HHS will establish such Exchange doesn't suggest that 

21

the State has established such Exchange if there was 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But the State, if made 

the 
 MR. CARVIN: 

 if there was ambiguity in 

that regard  just if I could finish my answer to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

Justice Breyer  you look at a parallel provision where 

2

they use precisely the same language, and they said, 

3

"and shall be treated as a State," that language which 

4

is notably omitted from 1321 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

6

 MR. CARVIN: 

Correct  correct ­ you're right . 
 and it's a basic principle 

7

of statutory construction that you interpret the same 

8

phrases the same way.  And it shows that Congress knew 

9

how to create equivalence between nonState Exchanges 

10

and Exchanges if and when it wanted to. 

11

 Sorry, Justice Sotomayor. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

 (Laughter.) 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Take a breath. 

I'm  I'm a little 

15

concerned with how you envision this provision working. 

16

You're saying that the HHS Exchange can't be for the 

17

State so that it's established by the choice of the 

18

State. 

19

 The choice the State had was establish your 

20

own Exchange or let the Federal government establish it 

21

for you.  That was the choice.  If we read it the way 

22

you're saying, then we're going to read a statute as 

23

intruding on the FederalState relationship, because 

24

then the States are going to be coerced into 

25

establishing their own Exchanges.  And you say, oh, no,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

they can't be coerced, but let's go back to what Justice 

2

Breyer was talking about. 

3

 In those States that don't  their citizens 

4

don't receive subsidies, we're going to have the death 

5

spiral that this system was created to avoid.  States 

6

are obligated, insurers are obligated to make sure that 

7

in their States, whether they're part of this program or 

8

not, that they have guaranteed coverage, that 26  that 

9

children are covered till they're 26, and that they base 

10

their costs on community ratings.  So if they have to do 

11

that, then costs are going to rise on every insurance 

12

every insurance plan offered in the country in those 34 

13

States, 3 or 6 of  or 9 of your States will have 

14

tightened their Medicaid eligibility requirements in 

15

contravention of the Act, so they're taking money by 

16

breaking their compacts.  They would have to lose all of 

17

their Medicaid money. 

18

 Tell me how that is not coercive in an 

19

unconstitutional way?  And if it is coercive in an 

20

unconstitutional way, in Bond just  I think it was 

21

last term, we said that that is a primary statutory 

22

command; that we read a statute in a way where we don't 

23

impinge on the basic FederalState relationship. 

24
25

 MR. CARVIN: 

This Court has never suggested 

outside the very unusual coercion context of the NFIB

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

Medicaid that a funding condition somehow invades a 

2

State police power.  Obviously 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Oh, we did it  we said 

it last year. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

In an NF  no, no.  In Bond, 

6

there the Federal government was taking away a police 

7

power.  Here, all the Federal government is doing is 

8

saying you want billions of free Federal dollars. 

9

That's hardly invading State sovereignty and it's the 

10

kind of routine  funding condition that this Court 

11

has upheld countless times. As to the 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Let me say that from the 

13

standpoint of the dynamics of Federalism, it does seem 

14

to me that there is something very powerful to the point 

15

that if your argument is accepted, the States are being 

16

told either create your own Exchange, or we'll send your 

17

insurance market into a death spiral.  We'll have people 

18

pay mandated taxes which will not get any credit 

19

on  on the subsidies.  The cost of insurance will be 

20

skyhigh, but this is not coercion.  It seems to me that 

21

under your argument, perhaps you will prevail in the 

22

plain words of the statute, there's a serious 

23

constitutional problem if we adopt your argument. 

24

 MR. CARVIN: 

25

 One is the government's never made that

Two points, Justice Kennedy. 

Alderson Reporting Company

17

 argument.  Number two, I'd like to think 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Sometimes we think of 

 things the government doesn't. 

4

 (Laughter.) 

5

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, I certainly hope you do 

6

 in this case, but not  not on this question. 

7

 What  what I'm trying to, quite seriously, Justice 

8

 Kennedy, convey is if this was unconstitutional, then 

9

 the Medicaid statute that this Court approved in NFIB 

10

 would be unconstitutional. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Carvin, where the 

12

 what would the consequence of unconstitutionality be? 

13

 Very often you have an ambiguous provision, could be 

14

 interpreted one way or another way.  If interpreting it 

15

 one way is unconstitutional, you interpret it the other 

16

 way. 

17

 MR. CARVIN: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Correct. 
But do we have any case 

19

 which says that when there is a clear provision, if it 

20

 is unconstitutional, we can rewrite it? 

21

 MR. CARVIN: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23
24

And that  and that 
Is there any case we have 

 that says that? 
 MR. CARVIN: 

No, Your Honor. 

25

JUSTICE SCALIA: Of course not. MR. CARVIN: And that was 

26

 really my point, Justice Kennedy.  Think about the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

 consequences when  of the Medicaid deal as being 

2

 coercive.  22 states have said no to the Medicaid deal. 

3

 That has created a bizarre anomaly in the law; that if 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I  I fully understand

 that, but I think the Court and the counsel for both

 sides should confront the proposition that your argument 

10

 raises a serious constitutional question.  Now, I'm not 

11

 sure that the government would agree with that, but it 

12

  it is in the background of how we interpret this 

13

 how we interpret this statute.

 MR. CARVIN:

 quite different.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I'm not sure, In  in South Carolina

6

 the highways, you have to go 35 miles an hour all over

 the State.  We wouldn't allow that.

 MR. CARVIN: 

No.  Well, there, of course, 

 you would be interfering with a basic State prerogative 

10

 as to establish their limits, and they are  the 

11

 condition is not related to that.  Here the condition is 

12

 perfectly related to it. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

14

 MR. CARVIN: 

15
16

Mr. Carvin 
We want to create something new 

 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Carvin, here's a 

17

 you refer to the Medicaid example.  That's a familiar 

18

 a grantinaid says to the State, here's the Federal 

19

 money and here's the conditions, take it or leave it. 

20

 That's one pattern.  But this pattern that we have says 

21

 flexible State.  You can  you can have your program if 

22

 you want it, and if you don't, there's a fallback. 

23

 There's the Federal program.  I mean, that's a typical 

24

 pattern.  It's the pattern of the Clean Air Act.  You 

25

 can have a State implementation plan, but State, if you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

 don't give  up your plan, there's a Federal implementation 

2

 plan. ButI have never seen anything like this where it's 

3

 if you take what the statute says you can have in 1321, 

4

 then you get these disastrous consequences. 

5

 MR. CARVIN: 

That's why this is much less 

6

 risky a deal for Congress.  And what distinguishes it 

7

 from Medicaid as the dissenting opinion in NFIB pointed 

8

 out.  In Medicaid, Congress is playing all in, take it 

9

 or leave it.  If they turn down the deal, then Medicaid 

10

 is completely thwarted.  Here, if they turn down the 

11

 subsidy deal, they still get the valuable benefits of an 

12

 Exchange and there's not a scintilla of 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What  what are those 

14

 benefits?  What are the customers that can buy on it? 

15

 What are the insurers that will sell on it? 

16

 MR. CARVIN: 

17

 One is we know textually that they thought 

Well, three points. 

18

 Exchanges without subsidies work, because again, they 

19

 have territorial Exchanges, but the government concedes 

20

 no subsidies.

 last time in this neverending saga. 

2

 (Laughter.) 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You said the  you said 

4

 without the subsidies driving demand within the 

5

 Exchanges, insurance companies would have absolutely no 

6

 reason to offer their products through Exchanges.  And 

7

 then you said the insurance Exchanges cannot operate as 

8

 intended by Congress absent the subsidies. 

9

 MR. CARVIN: 

That is entirely true.  They 

10

 wouldn't have operated as intended because Congress 

11

 intended all 50 States to take this deal. 

12

 So eliminating 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14
15
16

 all?  Obviously, they thought that some States wouldn't. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, they thought it was 

 possible and 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MR. CARVIN: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20
21

So why create 1326 at 

Very possible. 
And then 
Because they set up a 

 mechanism for that to happen. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

And then they  what happens? 

22

 You still get the Exchange.  It's not like Medicaid 

23

 where the entire Federal program is thwarted.  You get 

24

 the benefits that were lauded. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But nobody is going to go no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

 one's going to visit the program if there are no subsidies 

2

 because not enough people will buy the programs to stay 

3

 in the Exchanges. 

4

 MR. CARVIN: 

That is demonstrably untrue and 

5

 not reflected anywhere in the legislative history.  The 

6

 legislative history quite clearly contradicts that. 

7

 Many senators got up and said there are very valuable 

8

 benefits to the Exchange, onestop shopping, Amazon, as 

9

 President Obama has said.  The government came in the 

10

 last case and told you these two things operate quite 

11

 independently.  We don't need Exchange without 

12

 subsidies.  In contrast, there's not a scintilla of 

13

 legislative history suggesting that without subsidies, 

14

 there will be a death spiral.  Not a word. 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Wait a minute.  That was 

16

 the whole purpose that drove this bill because States 

17

 had experimented with this, and those that didn't have 

18

 subsidies or other  other provisions of the Act didn't 

19

 survive. 

20

 MR. CARVIN: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22
23

They didn't have 
You said it yourself in 

 the prior case. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

No.  The prior case was about 

24

 the individual mandate.  The government came in and said 

25

 the individual mandate is necessary to affect death

Alderson Reporting Company

 spirals.  No one, in the findings in Congress or 

2

 anywhere else, suggested that subsidies were available. 

3

 Will subsidies reduce the number of people available on 

4

 the individual 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

My problem  my problem 

6

 is that  the reverse.  You're talking about Congress, 

7

 how  hiding, borrowing the phrase of one of my 

8

 colleagues, a  a  a huge thing in a mousetrap. 

9

 Okay?  Because do you really believe that States fully 

10

 understood that they were not going to get  their 

11

 citizens were not going to get subsidies if they let the 

12

 Federal government?  What senator said that during the 

13

 hearings? 

14

 MR. CARVIN: 

The same amount of senators who 

15

 said that subsidies were available on HHS Exchanges, 

16

 which is none.  They didn't deal with it in the 

17

 legislative history just as they didn't deal with 

18

 Medicaid because the statute was quite clear. 

19

 Let's talk about it in context again, 

20

 Justice Sotomayor.  The context is the only provisions 

21

 in the Act establishing any limit on the subsidies is 

22

 found in 36B.  So it's not a mouse hole.  It's the place 

23

 you'd expect to find it.  It's the only place in the Act 

24

 that limits subsidies to purchases made on Exchange. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What I told you was it wouldn't

23

 deal would work just like the Medicaid deal where all 50 

24

 States would say yes, so you would have both of 

25

 congressional purposes.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Then why in the world 

2

 would they set up this whole extra thing if they didn't 

3

 think anybody was going to take it? 

4

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, that  that was my 

5

 response to Justice Sotomayor.  That  that is 

6

 completely unsupported empirical observation made post 

7

 hoc by amicus.  There's no reflection of that in the 

8

 legislative history.  Indeed, the legislative history 

9

 refutes it.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So maybe it makes 

And  and if I could return to 

 context because I think 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I mean  I'm sorry, Mr. 

 Carvin.  Please. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

Just very briefly, Justice 

 Kagan.  Very much appreciate it. 
 To  to respond, we've already talked about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

 context.  Section 1311 is a key part of this context. 

2

 It says in the strongest possible terms we want States 

3

 to run these Exchanges.  If you give unconditional 

4

 subsidies, then, of course, there is absolutely no 

5

 incentive for States to do it, and you have 

6

 fundamentally undermined that distinct statutory 

7

 purpose.  Whereas if you condition subsidies, Congress 

8

 accomplishes both of its goals.  Widespread subsidies, 

9

 plus Staterun Exchanges. 

10

 In terms of terms of art, again, there is 

11

 language in the statute which says 

12

 "Exchanges," "Exchanges under the Act."  Those phrases 

13

 naturally encompass both HHS Exchanges and 

14

 Stateestablished Exchanges. 

15

 And, yet, the Solicitor General is coming 

16

 here to tell you that a rational, Englishspeaking 

17

 person intending to convey subsidies available on HHS 

18

 Exchanges use the phrase "Exchanges established by the 

19

 State." 

20

 He cannot provide to you any rational reason 

21

 why somebody trying to convey the former would use the 

22

 latter formulation. 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. Carvin, why 

24

 don't you take an extra ten minutes and maybe we'll give 

25

 you a little bit more of a chance to talk.

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. CARVIN: 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

3

 (Laughter.) 

5

 MR. CARVIN: 

7

Well, then, I'll ask a 

 question. 

4

6

Okay.  Fine. 

Well, if you're going to ruin 

 my ten minutes. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No.  I mean, let's go back 

8

 to this question of where  where Congress put this 

9

 thing because putting aside constitutional issues, I 

10

 mean, there's at least a presumption, as we interpret 

11

 statutes, that Congress does not mean to impose heavy 

12

 burdens and Draconian choices on States unless it says 

13

 so awfully clearly. 

14

 And here  and this goes back to what 

15

 Justice Ginsburg was saying  there's really nothing 

16

 clear about this.  I mean, this took a year and a half 

17

 for anybody to even notice this language. 

18

 And as Justice Ginsburg said, it's  it's 

19

 put in not in the place that you would expect it to be 

20

 put in, which is where it says to the  the States, 

21

 here is the choice you have.  It's not even put in where 

22

 the statute defines who a qualified individual is or who 

23

 is entitled to get the subsidies.  Rather, it comes in 

24

 in this technical formula that's directed to the 

25

 Department of the Treasury saying how much the amount of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1
2

 the subsidy should be. 
 And that seems to be  it both makes no 

3

 sense from Congress's point of view, and in terms of our 

4

 own point of view, in terms of interpreting statutes, 

5

 that's not the clarity with which we require the 

6

 government to speak when it's upsetting FederalState 

7

 relations like this. 

8
9

 MR. CARVIN: 

I must respectfully disagree 

 for three reasons, Justice Kagan.  In the first place, 

10

 of course, you  where else would you expect a tax 

11

 credit except in the tax code?  That's where this was. 

12

 You wouldn't put it in 42 U.S.C., which has nothing to 

13

 do with taxes.  It's the only place where Exchange is 

14

 limitations placed. 

15

 You have three audiences here, not just 

16

 States.  You have to tell taxpayers what they're 

17

 entitled to.  You have to tell insurance companies when 

18

 these subsidies are available.  And you have States.  So 

19

 you have to put it in 36B. 

20

 So the argument, I guess, the government is 

21

 making is what you should have done is put half of it in 

22

 36B and half it in 1321 which, of course, would have 

23

 confused everybody.  36B would say, Exchanges, period. 

24

 Then you'd go to 1321 and say, when we said Exchanges in 

25

 36B, we meant established by the State.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If I were a 

2

 if I were a State official and I was trying to decide 

3

 whether my State should establish an Exchange, and I 

4

 wanted to know whether individuals who enrolled in a 

5

 plan on my possible Stateestablished Exchange would get 

6

 a credit, where would I look? 

7

 MR. CARVIN: 

Exactly.  The basic thesis here 

8

 is these Exchanges don't work without subsidies.  You've 

9

 read 1311.  You've read 1321.  Now you're going to go 

10

 find out where the subsidies are.  That's 36B.  They're 

11

 hypothesizing State 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

The  I think not, 

13

 Mr. Carvin.  I mean, I think the place I would look to 

14

 find out about my choices is in the provision of the 

15

 statute that talks about my choices. 

16

 I think the last place I would look is a 

17

 provision of the statute that talks about  what is 

18

 it  coverage months for purposes of this subsection, 

19

 which, by the way, isn't even the right subsection, but 

20

 whatever.  That  that's where I would look, is in 

21

 is in where it talks about what a coverage month is? 

22

 MR. CARVIN: 

But  but, Your Honor, I've 

23

 already described the difficulties of putting it  part 

24

 of it in 1321, right?  Because then you would create 

25

 this bizarre tax credit provision which is only half

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

 true, and you wouldn't tell taxpayers and insurance 

2

 companies.  So I believe that's the complete answer. 

3

 But the other practical point I'd like to 

4

 make is they had three years to implement this.  And no 

5

 one thought the States were going to have to make a 

6

 decision overnight.  If the IRS had done its job, every 

7

 State would have been fully informed of the consequences 

8

 because presumably they've read 36B, and then they would 

9

 make an intelligent decision well in advance of the 

10

 two  2013 deadline. 

11

 So there's a bizarre notion that States were 

12

 somehow unable to read a statute or to  or to read a 

13

 regulation is simply 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I really want  I really 

15

 want to hear what you're going to say in your 5 to 

16

 10 minutes.  And if you want, only if you want, I would 

17

 be interested in your responses to the government's 

18

 brief, that if you read the words "established by the 

19

 State" without reference to the technical definition as 

20

 you wish, this isn't just about the taxes; it means 

21

 employers in Virginia don't have to make policy, don't 

22

 have to  don't have to give policies, but if they have 

23

 one Maryland worker they do; it means that they never 

24

 can tighten up their Medicaid regulations, never, in 34 

25

 States  but, of course, in the others they can; it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

 means that there's no qualified person ever to buy 

2

 anything on a  an Exchange established by the 

3

 Secretary for the State, and they have two or three 

4

 other anomalies that have nothing to do with taxes, all 

5

 of which supports their argument that you have to read 

6

 this phrase technically according to the definition. 

7

 Now, that's their basic point. 

I've tried 

8

 to summarize it.  Do as you wish you.  I just want 

9

 you to have 5 or 10 minutes to answer it. 

10
11
12
13
14

 MR. CARVIN: 

Thank you.  And  and  and 

 the first point is there are no anomalies. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm going to clock that, 

 see if  see if you get 5 minutes. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

There are no  the first point 

15

 I'd like to make is there is no anomaly stemming from 

16

 our interpretation of 36B.  The government agrees with 

17

 that.  Their biggest anomaly is this qualified 

18

 individuals point about how there would be nobody on HHS 

19

 Exchanges.  The Solicitor General is not going to stand 

20

 up here and tell you that if we prevail in our 

21

 interpretation of 36B, they would be obliged by the 

22

 logic of that opinion to empty out HHS Exchanges.  So we 

23

 all agree that there's no connection between 36B and the 

24

 qualified individual.  That's point one. 

25

 Point two is, if you want anomalies, their

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

 interpretation of the statute requires 34 States today 

2

 to lose all Medicaid coverage.  Why is that?  Because of 

3

 the provisions on 64a through 66a of the government's 

4

 brief, there are various requirements that the State, on 

5

 pain of losing all of its Medicaid funds, must 

6

 coordinate between the Stateestablished Exchange, the 

7

 State agency for CHIP, and the State agency for Medicaid 

8

 in terms of secure interface and enrollment. 

9

 Now that makes perfect sense if "Exchange 

10

 established by the State" means what it says, but they 

11

 think it encompasses HHS Exchanges.  Well, the State 

12

 cannot ensure coordination between HHS Exchanges and the 

13

 State agencies, and none of the 34 are doing it today. 

14

 So under their atextual reading of the statute, 34 

15

 States will suffer the penalty that this Court found in 

16

 NFIB as unconstitutionally coercive. 

17

 As to this Medicaid maintenance anomaly, the 

18

 government agrees that the purpose of this provision was 

19

 to freeze Medicaid payments until you had an Exchange 

20

 with subsidies, which makes sense, right?  You want to 

21

 coordinate the two. 

22

 And that's exactly what this provision means 

23

 under our interpretation.  Until you have an Exchange 

24

 with subsidies, the States will be frozen. 

25

 The government says, that thing ended on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

 January 1, 2014.  That's a figment of their imagination. 

2

 It's nowhere in the statute; plus which it makes no 

3

 sense.  Before 2014, the States were powerless to have 

4

 an Exchange with subsidies, right?  They couldn't do it. 

5

 So there was a 3year freeze on Medicaid that they were 

6

 powerless to get out of. 

7

 After 2014, if they don't want to have their 

8

 Medicaid frozen, all they have to do is establish an 

9

 Exchange.  So it's a less harsh restriction on States, 

10

 plus which it gives them another incentive in addition 

11

 to the subsidies to create the State Exchange, which is 

12

 the purpose enunciated in 1311. 

13

 I don't know  oh, as to, yeah, maybe 

14

 somebody would from another  if you had an employee 

15

 that let  lived in other State, maybe he would be 

16

 subject to the employer mandate.  Why is that an 

17

 anomaly?  Congress likes the employer mandate.  Of 

18

 course they wanted to expand it.  They also never 

19

 thought it would really happen because, again, what they 

20

 thought was going to happen was there wouldn't be 

21

 neighboring States without it because nobody was going 

22

 to turn down this extraordinarily generous deal. 

23

 I don't know if my 5 minutes are up, but 

24

 that  that's  that's my response to these anomalies.

3

 says that the Exchange shall make health plans available 

4

 to qualified individuals, and then the next section says 

5

 that qualified individual means an individual who 

6

 resides in the State that established the Exchange. 

7

 So under your theory, if Federal Exchanges 

8

 don't qualify as Exchanges established by the State, 

9

 that means Federal Exchanges have no customers. 

10

 MR. CARVIN: 

Which, of course, is not the 

11

 reading that the government's giving to it because 

12

 they're not going to tell you 

13
14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, that's  that's 

 because they don't share your theory. 

15

 MR. CARVIN: 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

17

 MR. CARVIN: 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

19

 MR. CARVIN: 

No, no. 
Under your theory 
No. 
 that's the result. 
Well, no.  Let me be as clear 

20

 as I can.  If we prevail in this case, they are not 

21

 going to empty out the HHS Exchanges because they 

22

 understand that there are numerous defenses even if you 

23

 interpret "established by the State" literally in the 

24

 qualified individuals provision. 

25

 Number one defense that they will use is, it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

 says you have to be a qualified individual with respect 

2

 to an Exchange.  As Justice Breyer pointed out, the 

3

 statutory definition of Exchange is a 1311 Exchange.  So 

4

 they're only talking about State Exchanges, not these 

5

 HHS Exchanges, and it is in Section 1312, which 

6

 immediately follows 1311, before 1321. 

7

 Number two, "qualified individual" doesn't 

8

 mean that  that means you're guaranteed access.  It 

9

 doesn't mean if you're not qualified, you're absolutely 

10

 denied access.  We know that from the illegal alien 

11

 provision, which says illegal aliens are neither 

12

 qualified individuals nor eligible for subsidies. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ah, but look at the  look 

14

 at the prisoner provision, which it says prisoners 

15

 shouldn't be treated as qualified individuals.  So under 

16

 your theory, this statute effectively said that 

17

 prisoners should be able to enroll on Federal Exchanges? 

18

 That makes no sense. 

19

 MR. CARVIN: 

It makes perfect sense to say 

20

 the States get a choice.  Think about somebody who's in 

21

 prison in February, they're getting out in April, 

22

 they've got to buy insurance under the individual 

23

 mandate.  So if you said nobody who's incarcerated can 

24

 buy insurance, that means they wouldn't be able to buy 

25

 insurance during the relevant enrollment period.  It

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

 makes perfect sense to give States the flexibility to 

2

 say, as to those incarcerated principles, you can make 

3

 them available for Exchanges, but under illegal aliens 

4

 we don't want to, which is why we are saying they are 

5

 neither qualified nor eligible. 

6

 Even if Justice  even if you don't find 

7

 that the most pristine logic to be applied to a statute, 

8

 remember, we are interpreting these statutes to avoid an 

9

 absurd result.  And it's a basic principle of statutory 

10

 construction that you will give a plausible, if not the 

11

 most persuasive, reading to a statute to avoid the 

12

 result. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But we are interpreting a 

14

 statute generally to make it make sense as a whole, 

15

 right?  We look at the whole text.  We don't look at 

16

 four words.  We look at the whole text, the particular 

17

 context, the more general context, try to make 

18

 everything harmonious with everything else.  I think you 

19

 said, even at the very beginning of this argument as we 

20

 were going back and forth about my hypothetical, that, 

21

 of course, context matters and context might make all 

22

 the difference with respect to what those five words 

23

 mean. 

24

 And I think what we're suggesting is that, 

25

 if you look at the entire text, it's pretty clear that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

 you oughtn't to treat those five words in the way you 

2

 are. 

3

 MR. CARVIN: 

I've given you the contextual 

4

 points before.  I think the key one that I'd like to 

5

 convey to you, Justice Kagan, is Section 1311.  You say 

6

 the  the statute must work harmoniously.  If you 

7

 provide a  subsidies to HHS Exchanges, you have 

8

 essentially gutted Section 1311's strong preference for 

9

 State Exchanges. 

10

 What will happen is precisely what did 

11

 happen under the IRS rule, twothirds of the States are 

12

 saying no, we're not going to undertake this thankless 

13

 task of running these Exchanges with no incentives to do 

14

 so.  So yes, it  what I have here in terms of what the 

15

 statute means is 36B quite clearly saying Exchanges are 

16

 available only on States.  I have 1311 explaining why 

17

 they limited subsidies to that.  And there is no 

18

 contrary legislative history at all. 

19

 What do they have, an atextual reading of 

20

 36B, which they can't explain why anybody would have 

21

 used those words if they wanted to convey Exchanges, a 

22

 rule that completely undermines the purposes of  of 

23

 1311 and no supporting legislative history.  So under 

24

 all the legal materials that this Court normally used to 

25

 discern what statute means, we clearly prevail.

Thank you, counsel. 

 minutes as well. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

 Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 Standing has been raised, so let me start by 

9

 telling you where we stand on     standing and then I'd 

10

 appreciate the opportunity after that to summarize what 

11

 I think are the two key points in this case. 

12

 Now, with respect to standing, the question 

13

  the case or controversy question turns on whether any 

14

 of the four Petitioners is liable for the tax penalty 

15

 for 2014. 

16

 Now, this case was litigated in  in the 

17

 district court in 2013 based on projections on the part 

18

 of each of the four Petitioners that they would earn a 

19

 certain income in 2014.  They filed declarations saying 

20

 that.  With respect to 2 of the 4, the projections were 

21

  of their income were such that they would qualify for 

22

 the unaffordability exception and they wouldn't have 

23

 standing.  With respect to the other 2, their 

24

 projections were such that they wouldn't qualify for the 

25

 unaffordability exception and they would have standing.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

 But those were projections in 2013 about their income in 

2

 2014.  2014 has now come and gone, and we know  we 

3

 don't know, but Petitioners know whether any of the 4 

4

 have, in fact  are, in fact, liable for the tax 

5

 penalty and that will depend on whether their  their 

6

 actual income in 2014 matched their projections. 

7

 Now, Mr. Carvin said there was factfinding 

8

 about this.  I'm afraid that's not correct.  The  the 

9

 Petitioners  the Petitioners did file a motion for 

10

 summary judgment, but the case was decided on the basis 

11

 of the government's motion to dismiss before discovery 

12

 and without any factfinding. 

13

 I'm assuming because Mr. Carvin has not said 

14

 anything about the absence of a tax penalty, that, at 

15

 least, 1 of the 4 has and is, in fact, liable for a tax 

16

 penalty, but that's the key standing question. 

17

 Now, with respect to the veterans point, 

18

 Your Honor, if it is the case, as Mr. Carvin tells us, 

19

 that Mr. Hurst was a veteran for only 10 months, then I 

20

 think he's correct, he would not qualify for VA health 

21

 care because you generally have to serve two years.  So 

22

 that's where we are on standing. 

23

 Now, if I could turn to the merits. 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

So are you saying one 

 person does have standing?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, no.  It will depend 

2

 on whether as a factual matter 1 of the 4 has and is, in 

3

 fact, liable for the tax penalty for 2014.  And that's 

4

 information that is not in the government's possession; 

5

 it is in the possession of Petitioners' counsel.  And I 

6

 should make one more point, with respect to 2015, there 

7

 were no projections, there's nothing in the record about 

8

 the possible income of any of the Petitioners for 2015, 

9

 so there's really nothing that would establish a case of 

10
11

 controversy for 2014. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you're surely 

12

 not raising a standing question with us here for the 

13

 first time at oral argument, are you? 

14

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

15

 as I said, that based on the projections, it is our 

16

 it was our understanding that at least 1 of the 4 would 

17

 be liable for a tax penalty.  The question of standing 

18

 has been raised and I've tried to identify for the Court 

19

 what I think is the relevant question, which is whether 

20

 any one of the 4 has, in fact  is, in fact, liable for 

21

 a tax penalty because 

22
23
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

This is  this is 

 on a motion to dismiss, right? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, that's correct, 

 Your Honor, but it does also go to this Court's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

 jurisdiction.  Because if there's no  if none of the 4 

2

 is liable for a tax penalty for 2014, there just isn't 

3

 the case or controversy.  None of them is liable, 

4

 there's no  there's no injury.  And so I do think 

5

 that's ultimately the relevant question here and  with 

6

 respect to standing.  I don't think there's a question 

7

 about veteran status, but I do think that's the relevant 

8

 question. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Isn't the question before us 

10

 as to standing whether the district court correctly held 

11

 in the motion to dismiss context that there was 

12

 standing?  That may not be the end of the matter, but 

13

 don't we have to  isn't that what's before us? 

14

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, that  that may be 

15

  yes.  But then you  and you might alternatively 

16

 think about this as a question of mootness, I guess, in 

17

 that, you know, based on the projection, there was a 

18

 case or controversy, but if the projection didn't come 

19

 to pass and none of the plaintiffs is liable for a tax 

20

 penalty, then the case or controversy no longer exists. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what are you 

22

 suggesting?  Should we have a  should we have a trial 

23

 here? 

24

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, I'm not suggesting 

 anything of the kind.

 position is on standing.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, you  would you 

 send it back then to  to the district court? 

9

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I guess no.  I 

10

 guess what I've said is that  that Mr. Carvin hasn't 

11

 suggested that there's no plaintiff liable for a tax 

12

 penalty.  Based on that, I'm inferring that at least one 

13

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So I guess what I'm

 saying 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I mean, we know at least 

 one of them won't because that's 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

What I'm saying about 

5

 that is I'm actually going to step further than that, 

6

 Justice Sotomayor, given that there hasn't been  I'm 

7

 willing to accept the absence of a representation as an 

8

 indication that there is a case or controversy here, 

9

 and  and so that's why, Mr. Chief Justice, we haven't 

10

 raised standing and that's what it  but I do think 

11

 that the key question is whether one of the four is 

12

 liable for a tax penalty.  You have to have that to have 

13

 a case or controversy in the case. 

14

 If I could now, let me please turn to the 

15

 merits and summarize what I think are the two key 

16

 points.  First, our reading follows directly from the 

17

 text of the Act's applicable provisions and it's really 

18

 the only way to make sense of both Section 36B and the rest 

19

 of the Act.  Textually, their reading produces an 

20

 incoherent statute that doesn't work; and second, our 

21

 reading is compelled by the Act's structure and design. 

22

 Their reading forces HHS to establish rump Exchanges 

23

 that are doomed to fail.  It makes a mockery of the 

24

 statute's express  status express textual promise of 

25

 State flexibility.  It precipitates the insurance market

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

 death spirals that the statutory findings specifically 

2

 say the statute was designed to avoid, and of course it 

3

 revokes the promise of affordable care for millions of 

4

 Americans.  That cannot be the statute that Congress 

5

 intended. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course it could be.  I 

7

 mean it may not be the statute they intended.  The 

8

 question is whether it's the statute that they wrote.  I 

9

 mean, you know, there  there  there are no 

10

 provisions in a statute that turn out to be ill 

11

 illconsidered and ill  illconceived. 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So it's not the statute 

13

 that they wrote, and the reason it's not the statute 

14

 that they wrote, I think  I want to actually start, if 

15

 I could, picking up I think on a variation of the 

16

 hypothetical that Justice Kagan ask  asked.  In 

17

 Petitioners' brief they throw down the gauntlet with 

18

 respect to a hypothetical about airports, and that  a 

19

 statute requires a State to construct an airport, it 

20

 says the Federal government shall construct such airport 

21

 if the State doesn't, and no one would think that the 

22

 Federal government's airport was an airport constructed 

23

 by the State. 

24
25

 Well, what I would say to that is that if 
 those statutory provisions were conjoined with a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

 provision that said airplanes may only land at airports 

2

 constructed by the State, that you would conclude 

3

 immediately that what  that  that that Federally 

4

 constructed airport qualifies as an airport constructed 

5

 by the State, and the  because otherwise the statute 

6

 would make no sense.  And the same exact thing is true 

7

 here. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There are no statutes that 

 make no sense. 

10

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

This one makes sense. 
Is that the case? Every 

12

 statute must make sense and we will  we will twist the 

13

 words as necessary to make it make  that can't be the 

14

 rule. 

15
16

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

That isn't the rule.  But 

 the rule 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Of course not. 
 is that you read 

19

 that you don't read statutory provisions in isolation; 

20

 you read them in context.  The rule is that you read 

21

 them in order to ensure that the statute operates as a 

22

 harmonious whole.  You read them so that you don't 

23

 render the statutory provisions ineffective.  You read 

24

 them to promote FederalState balance 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Where that is possible.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 you read 
I mean, you acknowledge 

3

 that all of what you're saying only applies where there 

4

 are alternative readings that are reasonable.  You pick 

5

 the one that will do all the things that you say. 

6
7
8
9

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

And there is  there 

 is 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But, but  if  if it can 

 only reasonably mean one thing, it will continue to mean 

10

 that one thing even if it has untoward consequences for 

11

 the rest of the statute.  No? 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

With respect to this 

13

 statute, first, let me  I want to make two points. 

14

 First 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Answer me in principle.  I 

16

 mean, is it not the case that if the only reasonable 

17

 interpretation of a particular provision produces 

18

 disastrous consequences in the rest of the statute, it 

19

 nonetheless means what it says.  Is that true or not? 

20

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think there are 

21

 there are a couple of limitations on that principle. 

22

 The first is if what you have is a situation in which 

23

 the  that it creates conflict within a statutory scheme, 

24

 then the Court's got to do its best to try to harmonize 

25

 and reconcile the provisions.  And secondly 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I disagree with that. 

2

 You have a single case in which we have said the 

3

 provision is not ambiguous, it means this thing, but, 

4

 Lord, that would make a terrible statute, so we will 

5

 interpret it to mean something else.  Do you have one 

6

 case where we've ever said that? 

7

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think  I think Brown 

8

 & Williamson is a good example of that.  In Brown & 

9

 Williamson, the Court said, look, the definition of drug 

10

 and drug delivery device would actually seem 

11

 unambiguously to cover tobacco, but when you read that 

12

 provision in context, and considering the full scope of 

13

 the regulatory regime, it can't possibly mean that. 

14

 But let me  let me actually work through 

15

 the text here, because I do think I can show you that 

16

 there's a quite reasonable reading of this statutory 

17

 text that allows you to affirm and requires you to 

18

 affirm the government's position. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But, General Verrilli, 

20

 before we get too immersed in a number of provisions of 

21

 this, could you respond to a question that was asked 

22

 during Mr. Carvin's argument.  If we adopt Petitioners' 

23

 interpretation of this Act, is it unconstitutionally 

24

 coercive? 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So the  here's what I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

 would say about that, Justice Alito.  I think that it 

2

 would  certainly be a novel constitutional 

3

 question, and I think that I'm not prepared to say to 

4

 the Court today that it is unconstitutional.  It would 

5

 be my duty to defend the statute and on the authority of 

6

 New York v.  United States, I think we would do so.  But 

7

 I don't think there's any doubt that it's a novel 

8

 question, and if the Court believes it's a serious 

9

 question 

10
11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is it a  I was going to 

 say does novel mean difficult? 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Because it  it  it 

14

 does seem to me that if the Petitioners' argument is 

15

 correct, this is just not a rational choice for the 

16

 States to make and that they're being coerced. 

17

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

19
20

So what I 
And that you then have to 

 invoke the standard of constitutional avoidance. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, what I was going to 

21

 say, Justice Kennedy, is to the extent the Court 

22

 believes that this is a serious constitutional question 

23

 and this does rise to the level of something approaching 

24

 coercion, then I do think the doctrine of constitutional 

25

 avoidance becomes another very powerful reason to read

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

 the statutory text our way.  Because I do think  and I 

2

 do think with respect to the point that Your Honor's 

3

 making, remember, it's not just  it's not just a 

4

 situation in which there is onerous conditions, onerous 

5

 consequences for State residents.  It's also a profound 

6

 problem of notice here, that, you know, if you read 

7

 Petitioners'  if you take Petitioners' reading of the 

8

 statute, then the idea that States were given added 

9

 you can't possibly justify this as adequate notice to 

10
11

 the States. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, Mr.  General 

12

 Verrilli, let me ask you this about notice.  We get lots 

13

 and lots of amicus briefs from States.  And we got two 

14

 amicus briefs from States here; 34 states I think is 

15

 that's the number of States that declined to or failed 

16

 to establish a State Exchange? 

17

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Correct. 
Now, if they were all caught 

19

 off guard and they were upset about this, you would 

20

 expect them to file an amicus brief telling us that. 

21

 But actually, of the 34, only 6 of them signed the brief 

22

 that was submitted by a number of States making that 

23

 argument.  23 States, 23 jurisdictions submitted that 

24

 brief; 17 of them are States that established State 

25

 exchanges.  Only 6 of the States that didn't establish

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

 State exchanges signed that brief, how do you account 

2

 for that? 

3

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So, I  I guess I'd make 

4

 two points about that, Justice Alito.  First, you've got 

5

 22 States there, States in both camps, all of whom told 

6

 you that they didn't understand the statute that way. 

7

 Now, with respect to the other 8 States that 

8

 filed the amicus brief on the other side, I actually 

9

 think there's quite an important point that goes to 

10

 their understanding of what this Act did.  Remember, 

11

 this is an IRS rule that we're talking about here, and 

12

 the IRS put out a notice of proposed rulemaking saying 

13

 this is what we intend to do, and several of these 

14

 States  Oklahoma, Indiana, Nebraska  they filed 

15

 rulemaking comments in that  in that proceeding.  And 

16

 if you look at those rulemaking comments you will see 

17

 that they address a number of issues, and they say 

18

 nothing, nothing about the  the issue that's before 

19

 the Court now. 

20

 So if they really understood the statute as 

21

 denying subsidies in States that did not set up their 

22

 own exchanges, that would have front and center in their 

23

 rulemaking comments, but they said nothing about it and 

24

 I think that tells you a good deal about where 

25

 what  what everybody understood that this statute

 was 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, there's another point 

3

 on notice on this Pennhurst argument that seems curious 

4

 to me.  Usually when this argument comes up, a State has 

5

 signed up for a Federal program and then they say, oh, 

6

 my gosh, we didn't realize what we had gotten ourselves 

7

 into.  But here, it's not too late for a State to 

8

 establish an exchange if we were to adopt Petitioners' 

9

 interpretation of the statute.  So going forward, there 

10
11

 would be no harm. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, let  let me 

12

 address that directly, and then I'd like to make a 

13

 broader point about statutory context in response.  Now 

14

 directly, of course, I don't  I don't think it's 

15

 possible to say there would be no harm.  The tax credits 

16

 will be cut off immediately and you will have very 

17

 significant, very adverse effects immediately for 

18

 millions of people in many States in their insurance 

19

 markets 

20
21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 
 going forward. 

22

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

24
25

Well, I said  I've said 

And then 
After  after the current 

 tax year. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

And then going 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Would it not be possible if 

2

 we were to adopt Petitioners' interpretation of the 

3

 statute to stay the mandate until the end of this tax 

4

 year as we have done in other cases where we have 

5

 adopted an interpretation of the constitutional  or a 

6

 statute that would have very disruptive consequences 

7

 such as the Northern Pipeline case. 

8
9

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Sure.  Northern Pipeline 

 is an example of doing that, and it will be up to the 

10

 Court to decide whether it has the authority to do that. 

11

 I will say, this does seem different than Northern 

12

 Pipeline to me, because this is about money going out of 

13

 the Federal treasury, which is a different scenario. 

14

 But if the Court  obviously, if that's where the Court 

15

 is going and that's what the Court thinks the proper 

16

 disposition is, that would reduce the disruption. 

17

 But what I think is another important point 

18

 to make here just as a practical matter, the idea that a 

19

 number of States, all of these States or a significant 

20

 number are going to be able to in the 6 months between 

21

 when a decision in the this case would come out and when 

22

 the new  the new year for insurance purposes will 

23

 begin we'll be able to set up Exchanges, get them up, up 

24

 and running and get all the approvals done I think is 

25

 completely unrealistic.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How long has it taken 

2

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, for  just to give 

3

 you an example of the current time line, Justice 

4

 Ginsburg, the  in order to be  in order to have an 

5

 exchange approved and insurance policies on the exchange 

6

 ready for the 2016 year, those approvals have to occur 

7

 by May of 2015.  Okay.  So that gives you a sense of 

8

 the  of the time line that HHS is operating under. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about  what about 

10

 Congress?  You really think Congress is just going to 

11

 sit there while  while all of these disastrous 

12

 consequences ensue. 

13

 I mean, how often have we come out with a 

14

 decision such as the  you know, the bankruptcy court 

15

 decision?  Congress adjusts, enacts a statute that 

16

 that takes care of the problem.  It happens all the 

17

 time.  Why is that not going to happen here? 

18
19

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, this Congress, Your 

 Honor, I  I 

20

 (Laughter.) 

21

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

You know, I mean, of 

22

 course, theoretically  of course, theoretically they 

23

 could. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I don't care what 

 Congress you're talking about.  If the consequences are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

 as disastrous as you say, so many million people 

2

 without  without insurance and whatnot, yes, I think 

3

 this Congress would act. 

4

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

And  but the relevant 

5

 question  and then I'm going to try to get back to 

6

 the point I was trying to make in response to Justice 

7

 Alito's question. 

8
9

 The relevant question here is: 

What did the 

 Congress that enacted this statute in 2010 do?  Did they 

10

 really set up a system in which the States are subject 

11

 to the kind of onerous situation that the Petitioner 

12

 claims?  And I think there are three textual 

13

 indications  objective, textual indications that that 

14

 cannot possibly have been the statutory scheme that 

15

 Congress tried to set up. 

16

 First is the existence of the Federal 

17

 Exchanges.  It would make no sense, no sense for 

18

 Congress to have provided for Federal Exchanges if, 

19

 as  as Mr. Carvin suggests, the statutory design was 

20

 supposed to result in every State establishing its 

21

 Exchange. 

22

 Second 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, wouldn't it have 

24

 been  again, talking about Federalism  a mechanism 

25

 for States to show that they had concerns about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

 wisdom and the workability of the Act in the form that 

2

 it was passed? 

3

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So, Justice Kennedy, I 

4

 think the Federalism values are promoted by our 

5

 interpretation, because if  if that is, indeed, what a 

6

 State thought, if a State really would have preferred 

7

 that  not to have the State government participate in 

8

 the implementation of this Act, for reasons that Your 

9

 Honor identified, the structure of the Act that Congress 

10

 put in place and that we're advocating for today fully 

11

 vindicates that concern.  They can decide not to 

12

 participate without having any adverse consequences 

13

 visited upon the citizens of the State. 

14

 And that's why our reading is the 

15

 proFederalism reading.  It's their reading that seems 

16

 to me that is the antiFederalism reading, and that's a 

17

 powerful reason to reject it. 

18

 And if I could go to the second statutory 

19

 point, which is related to what we're talking about, 

20

 Justice Kennedy, which is Section 1321, says that this 

21

 statute is designed to afford State flexibility.  State 

22

 flexibility.  It would be an Orwellian sense of the word 

23

 "flexibility" to use it in the manner that Petitioners 

24

 say the statute uses it, because it's the polar opposite 

25

 of flexibility.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

 And the third point, seems to me, is the 

2

 notice point, that if, indeed, the plan was, as Mr. 

3

 Carvin said, that every State was going to establish an 

4

 Exchange for itself and that that would cure all of the 

5

 massive statutory anomalies and textual anomalies and 

6

 absurdities and impossibilities that his reading 

7

 provides for, if that was really the plan, then the 

8

 consequence for the States would be in neon lights in 

9

 this statute.  You would want to make absolutely sure 

10
11

 that every State got the message. 
 But instead what you have is a subclause in 

12

 Section 36B, which is a provision that addresses the 

13

 eligibility of individual taxpayers for taxing purposes. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

This is not the most 

15

 elegantly drafted statute.  It was  it was pushed 

16

 through on expedited procedures and didn't have the kind 

17

 of consideration by a conference committee, for example, 

18

 that  that statutes usually do. 

19

 What  what would be so surprising if 

20

 if, among its other imperfections, there is the 

21

 imperfection that what the States have to do is not 

22

 is not obvious enough?  It doesn't strike me as 

23

 inconceivable. 

24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So, Justice Scalia, I 

 I'm going to answer that question by talking about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

 legislative process, because I think it is quite 

2

 relevant and I think it ought to be quite relevant even 

3

 to you with respect to the question you just asked. 

4

 The language here in 36B was not the product 

5

 of some lastminute deal, it wasn't the product of 

6

 scrambling at the end.  The language that emerged here, 

7

 the statutory structure with the language of 36B about 

8

 tax credits, the language that's in 1311, the language 

9

 that's in 1321 was the product of the Senate Finance 

10

 Committee markup, which went on for weeks and weeks. 

11

 It was a public  it was a public hearing. 

12

 It  frankly, it was covered by CSPAN.  You can go 

13

 watch it on the CSPAN archives if you want to; and you 

14

 will see coming out of that that the  that the 

15

 understanding, the clear understanding was with this 

16

 statutory setup would result in subsidies being 

17

 available in every State. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There were senators, were 

19

 there not, who were opposed to having the Federal 

20

 government run the whole thing, because they thought 

21

 that would lead to a singlepayer system, which  which 

22

 some people wanted.  And the explanation for this 

23

 provision is it prevents  it prevents the  the 

24

 Federalization of  of the entire thing. 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No.  Justice Scalia, I 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 a plausible explanation 

3

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5
6

That's  that's certainly 

No. 
 as to why the provision 

 is there. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Mr. Carvin has floated 

7

 that as an explanation and he  and he suggests that it 

8

 was Senator Ben Nelson who required it.  We  there is 

9

 absolutely no contemporaneous evidence, none whatsoever, 

10

 that anybody thought that way, that the  the solution 

11

 to the problem that Your Honor's identified is what 

12

 Congress did by having States have the option to set up 

13

 their own Exchanges with StatebyState Federal 

14

 fallbacks rather than a national system. 

15

 Senator Nelson has made clear, he has stated 

16

 that he had no intention of the kind.  There's no 

17

 contemporaneous evidence at all that anyone did.  And I 

18

 do  and what Mr. Carvin has suggested is that this was 

19

 the product of some deal to try to get votes so the Act 

20

 could get passed. 

21

 What I would suggest to Your Honor is that 

22

 there is objective proof that that is not true.  The 

23

 the provisions in the Act that were negotiated at the 

24

 end to secure the necessary votes are in Title X of the 

25

 Act.  And if you look in the  in the Act, Pages 833 to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

 924  that's Title X  you can see all of the 

2

 amendments.  Not a single one has anything to do with 

3

 the statutory language before the Court now. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, the puzzle that's 

5

 created by  by your interpretation is this:  If 

6

 Congress did not want the phrase "established by the 

7

 State" to mean what that would normally be taken to 

8

 mean, why did they use that language?  Why didn't they 

9

 use other formulations that appear elsewhere in the Act? 

10

 Why didn't they say, "established under the Act"?  Why 

11

 didn't they say, "established within the State"?  Why 

12

 didn't they include a provision saying that an Exchange 

13

 established by HHS is a State Exchange when they have a 

14

 provision in there that does exactly that for the 

15

 District of Columbia and for the territories?  It says 

16

 that they are deemed to be States for purposes of this 

17

 Act. 

18

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

20

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So 
So why would they do that? 
So, of course, the 

21

 provision says  doesn't say "established by the State" 

22

 with a period after State.  It says "established by the 

23

 State under Section 1311."  And our position textually 

24

 is  and we think this is clearly the better reading of 

25

 the text  that by crossreferencing Section 1311,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

61
1

 effectively what Congress is doing is saying that 

2

 Exchanges established through whatever mechanism, 

3

 Exchanges set up by the States themselves, Exchanges set 

4

 up by 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you're saying that 

6

 by  by crossreference to 1311, they really mean 1311 

7

 and 1321? 

8
9
10
11
12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes.  Well, let me  and 

 I do think that, and let me walk through why I think 
 that's true. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

All right.  That  that 

 seems to me to go in the wrong direction 

13

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 not the 

17
18

No, I think 
 for your case 

 right direction. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, I think it goes in 

19

 the right direction, if you'll just ride with me for a 

20

 little bit, Justice Kennedy, on this. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, before you  before 

22

 you get on to that, that  your answer doesn't explain 

23

 why  why "by the State" is in there.  Then why didn't 

24

 they say "established under 1311"? 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, so the second point

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

62
1

 is that wherever this provision appears in the Act, 

2

 "established by the State under Section 1311," it's 

3

 doing work; and the work it's doing is saying, what 

4

 we're talking about is the specific Exchange established 

5

 in the specific State as opposed to general rules for 

6

 Exchanges.  If you look at the Medicaid 

7

 MaintenanceofEffort provision that  it works the 

8

 same way. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, why didn't they say 

10

 "in the State"?  That's the phrase you just used, "in 

11

 the State."  Why didn't they say "in the State"? 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Because  I suppose they 

13

 could have, but it worked perfectly well this way.  If 

14

 you look at the qualified individual provision, it's 

15

 clearly how they're using it with respect to the 

16

 qualified individual provision.  And with respect to 

17

 that provision, it says a qualified individual is a 

18

 person who is located  who resides in the State that 

19

 established the Exchange.  Clearly, what they're talking 

20

 about is a geographical reference to the particular 

21

 State.  That's what's going on there and what's going on 

22

 every time the  the statute uses that phrase.  So it's 

23

 doing that work, and that's why it's in there. 

24

 But now if I could go back to your point, 

25

 Justice Kennedy, it says, "established by the State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

63
1

 under Section 1311."  Section 1311(b)(1) says, "Each 

2

 State shall establish an American Health Benefits 

3

 Exchange for the State."  It's not, as Mr. Carvin said, 

4

 an urging that States do it.  It says, "Each State shall 

5

 establish." 

6

 Now, we know that when Congress used that 

7

 language, "each State shall establish," it must have 

8

 meant something more inclusive than each State 

9

 government shall itself set up the Exchange. 

10

 We know that because Congress is legislating 

11

 against the backdrop of the Tenth Amendment, and so it 

12

 couldn't impose that requirement.  And we know that 

13

 because of Section 1321, because Section 1321 provides 

14

 the means by which the 1311(b)(1) requirement is 

15

 satisfied.  It will be satisfied by a State electing to 

16

 meet the Federal requirements for Exchanges, or it can 

17

 be satisfied in the event that a State doesn't or tries, 

18

 but comes up short by HHS stepping in and establishing 

19

 the Exchange. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So when the statute says, 

21

 "each State shall establish," it really means the 

22

 Federal government shall establish if a State doesn't 

23

 establish. 

24

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I think the right way 
And if that were the correct

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

64
1
2

 interpretation, you wouldn't 1321 at all. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So  no.  I think the 

3

 right way to think about this, Justice Alito, is that 

4

 what's going on here is that  the right place to 

5

 focus, let me put it that way.  The right place to focus 

6

 here is not on the who, but on the what; on the thing 

7

 that gets set up and whether it qualifies as an Exchange 

8

 established by the State, and these Exchanges do 

9

 qualify. 

10

 And the reason they qualify is because they 

11

 fulfill the requirement in Section 1311(b)(1) that each 

12

 State shall establish an Exchange.  And 1321 tells you 

13

 that because it says to the HHS that when a  when a 

14

 State hasn't elected to meet the Federal requirements, 

15

 HHS steps in, and what the HHS does is set up the 

16

 required Exchange.  It says such Exchange, which is 

17

 referring to the  immediately prior to the required 

18

 Exchange where the only Exchange required in the Act is 

19

 an Exchange under Section 1311(b)(1). 

20

 So it has to be that that's  that what HHS 

21

 is doing under the plain text of the statute is 

22

 fulfilling the requirement of the Section 1311(b)(1) 

23

 that each State establish an Exchange, and for that 

24

 reason we say it qualifies as an Exchange established by 

25

 the State.  That's reinforced, as Justice Breyer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

65
1

 suggested earlier, by the definition which says that an 

2

 Exchange is an Exchange established under Section 1311. 

3

 1311, again, has 1311(b)(1) which says each State shall 

4

 establish an Exchange. 

5

 And it has to be that way because 

6

 Petitioners have conceded, and it's at page 22 of their 

7

 brief, that an Exchange that HHS sets up is supposed to 

8

 be the same Exchange that Petitioners say function just 

9

 like an Exchange that the State sets up for itself. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you're  you're 

11

 putting a lot of weight on the  on the  one word, 

12

 such, such Exchange.  Such  it seems to me the most 

13

 unrealistic interpretation of "such" to mean the Federal 

14

 government shall establish a State Exchange. 

15

 Rather, it seems to me "such" means an 

16

 Exchange for the State rather than an Exchange of the 

17

 State.  How can the government  Federal government 

18

 establish a State Exchange.  That is gobbledygook.  You 

19

 know, "such" must mean something different. 

20

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

It isn't gobbledygook, 

21

 Justice Scalia.  And I think about it and I go back to 

22

 something that Justice Alito asked earlier.  And 

23

 that  if the language of 36B were exactly the same as 

24

 it is now, and the statute said in 1321 that an Exchange 

25

 set up  set up by HHS shall qualify as an Exchange

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

66
1

 established by the State for purposes of Section 1311, 

2

 you wouldn't change the language of 36B one iota, and 

3

 that wouldn't be any doubt in anyone's mind that 

4

 the  that subsidies were available on Federal 

5

 Exchanges.  And what we're saying is that effectively 

6

 reading 1311 and 1321 together, that is what the statute 

7

 does. 

8
9

 And that is certainly  that is a 
 reasonable reading of the statute.  It is really the 

10

 only reading of the statute that allows you to be 

11

 faithful to the text of 1311(b)(1), the word "shall," 

12

 and to the Tenth Amendment.  In order for their 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The word "such" means 

14

 not  not just the Exchange that the State was supposed 

15

 to set up, but it means the State Exchange. 

16

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

It means an Exchange that 

17

 qualifies as satisfy  as an exchange established by 

18

 the State because it satisfies the requirement of 

19

 1311(b)(1). 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  You  you have to say 

21

 it means the State Exchange.  You have to  your case 

22

 hinges on the fact that a Federal Exchange is a State 

23

 Exchange for purposes 

24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

It hinges on  it hinges 

 on it qualifying as the State Exchange or being

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

67
1

 equivalent to the State Exchange for the purpose of the 

2

 operation of the statute.  That is a reasonable reading 

3

 of the particular textual provisions, and once you've 

4

 concluded that it's a reasonable reading of the 

5

 particular textual provisions, then you have to read it 

6

 the way that we say it needs  it is to be read because 

7

 it is the only way to make sense of the statute as a 

8

 whole.  It is the only way to bring it into harmony with 

9

 the Act's qualified individual and qualified health plan 

10

 provisions which do lead to what they admit is an 

11

 absurdity under their reading under the law. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Would you agree that 

13

 there  that there are provisions of the Act where the 

14

 exact same phrase, "established by the State," has to be 

15

 read to mean established by the State and not by HHS? 

16

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

18
19

I don't 
There are some provisions 

 like that. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

They've pointed out some, 

20

 but I think they're wrong about each one, and I don't 

21

 know what Your Honor has in mind. 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  Well, let's take 

23

 one  let's take one.  I'd be interested in your answer 

24

 to it.  42 U.S.C. Section 1396w3(h)(1)(D) which says 

25

 that each State shall establish procedures to ensure

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

68
1

 that an Exchange established by the State utilizes a 

2

 secure electronic interface.  And they say that if that 

3

 is read to  if "Exchange established by the State" 

4

 there is read to mean an HHS Exchange, that means that 

5

 the State in which that Exchange is established is 

6

 responsible for making sure that the Federal Exchange 

7

 has a secure electronic interface. 

8
9

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes.  They're just wrong 

 about that.  It's just completely wrong.  The statute 

10

 says that the State shall  first of all, the statutory 

11

 obligation is addressed to the State Medicaid and CHIP 

12

 agencies.  What it says is they shall establish 

13

 procedures to ensure the coordination.  HHS has issued 

14

 regulations setting forth what that statutory provision 

15

 requires of States in those circumstance.  Every State 

16

 where there is a federally facilitated Exchange has met 

17

 the requirements and fulfilled them, and it worked 

18

 perfectly fine.  There's no anomaly there at all. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And the State 
It met  it met the 

21

 requirements of the regulations you say, but do the 

22

 regulations track the statute? 

23

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Yes, they do. 
Do  do they give the 

 State authority to  to say whether or not these 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

69
1
2

 these conditions have been met? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

They  the requirements 

3

 are imposed on the State Medicaid and CHIP end of the 

4

 relationship.  That's what the statute does, and the 

5

 regulations  implement that statutory requirement, and 

6

 it's satisfied in every State. 

7

 And, of course, as Your Honor reading it to 

8

 me said, it does say  and I think that proves our 

9

 point.  The statute says each State shall.  It doesn't 

10

 say States that have set up Exchanges for themselves 

11

 shall.  It says each State shall.  It presupposes that 

12

 there is going to be something that qualifies as an 

13

 Exchange established by the State in every State.  So 

14

 there's no anomaly there, and if Your Honor wants to ask 

15

 me about any of the other ones, you can, but I  there 

16

 are no anomalies frankly. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

As I understand your answer 

18

 to be that there are Federal regulations telling the 

19

 States what they have to do here, and they've all done 

20

 it.  But the fact remains that the State has some 

21

 obligation under the regulations to make sure that there 

22

 is a proper interface with the Federal Exchange. 

23

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

On the State's side of 

24

 the interface, yes.  But that's the CHIP and Medicaid 

25

 agencies.  Those are State government agencies, and it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

70
1
2

 their side of the interface that the statute governs. 
 And, you know, as I said, I don't think 

3

 there are anomalies of our reading, but if they are, 

4

 they pale in comparison to the anomalies on the other 

5

 side.  I mean, I really do want to focus on this point 

6

 about the qualified health plan and the qualified 

7

 individual, because the statute is quite clear in 

8

 Section 1311 that an Exchange, not an Exchange 

9

 established by the State, but an Exchange can only sell 

10

 a qualified health plan.  It is forbidden from selling a 

11

 health plan that is not a qualified health plan.  And 

12

 that's not an Exchange established by the State.  It is 

13

 an Exchange. 

14

 Now, the statute also says that to certify a 

15

 health plan as qualified, the Exchange has to decide 

16

 that it is in the interest of qualified individuals. 

17

 Now, qualified individuals are persons who 

18

 reside in the State that established the Exchange.  So 

19

 if you read the statute, the language, the way 

20

 Mr. Carvin reads it instead of the way we read it, you 

21

 come to the conclusion and in a State in a federally 

22

 facilitated Exchange, there are no qualified 

23

 individuals.  Therefore, the Exchange cannot certify a 

24

 qualified health plan as being in the interest of 

25

 qualified individuals because there aren't any, so there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

71
1

 aren't any qualified health plans that can lawfully be 

2

 sold on the Exchange. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What is the provision that 

4

 says that only a  only a qualified individual can 

5

 be  can enroll in a plan under an Exchange? 

6

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So let  the  the  I 

7

 will address that, but I just want to make clear the 

8

 provision I'm talking about with respect to the  the 

9

 prohibition on selling a qualified health plan to 

10

 anybody on  on anything other than a qualified health 

11

 plan on an Exchange is 1311(d)(2)(B), which is at page 

12

 8a of the appendix to our brief.  It's absolutely 

13

 unambiguous.  An Exchange, not an Exchange established 

14

 by the State, an Exchange may not make available any 

15

 health plan that is not a qualified health plan.  So 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Qualified health plan.  But 

17

 what's the provision you were referring to when you said 

18

 that an Exchange may enroll only a qualified individual? 

19

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I  what they 

20

 what the statute says throughout is that  that 

21

 qualified individuals are eligible to purchase on 

22

 Exchanges, and it's the necessary meaning of that phrase 

23

 that if you are not a qualified individual, then you are 

24

 not eligible to purchase health care on an Exchange 

25

 because otherwise, the word qualified would not have any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

72
1

 meaning.  The whole  the meaning of the word qualified 

2

 is to distinguish between people who are eligible and 

3

 people who are ineligible.  And as a policy matter, it 

4

 wouldn't make any sense because think of the people who 

5

 are not qualified individuals.  The people who don't 

6

 live in the State, the people in prison, and they're 

7

 unlawfully documented aliens. 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

This is part of Section 

9

 1312.  A person qualified to purchase on an Exchange 

10

 must, quote, reside in the State that established the 

11

 Exchange. 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Right.  And there are no 

13

 such people in 34 States under Mr. Carvin's theory of 

14

 the statute.  So it just doesn't  it just  you just 

15

 run into a textual brick wall. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: Well I understand your argument 

17

 is that it's a  it's a logical inference from a number 

18

 of provisions that only a qualified individual may 

19

 purchase the policy, but I gather there is no provision 

20

 that you can point to that says that directly. 

21

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

It's  well, that's what 

22

 qualified means, Justice Alito.  It means that, you 

23

 know, if you're not qualified, you're unqualified.  And 

24

 so, I mean, that's what it means.  And so you're just 

25

 reading the word "qualified" out of the statute if you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

73
1
2

 read it that way. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

"Qualified" is used in 

3

 the  in the lay sense of the term, it's not a 

4

 technical term here. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I  I think 

6

 well, given the way it's defined, it's defined as a 

7

 person who resides in the State.  It excludes people out 

8

 of State.  It does that because the statute was quite 

9

 clear that you weren't going to be allowed to shop for 

10

 insurance policies across State lines because that would 

11

 infringe on traditional State prerogatives regulating 

12

 insurance.  And it  and with respect to prisoners, it 

13

 doesn't make any sense to say that prisoners should be 

14

 able to get insurance.  Mr. Carvin says, yes, it does 

15

 because they get out of prison.  Well, there's a 

16

 specific statutory provision that says when you face a 

17

 changedlife circumstance, such as getting out of 

18

 prison, you can sign up for insurance at that point.  He 

19

 makes the point about unlawfully present persons being 

20

 both unqualified and not being able to be covered, but 

21

 that's not  that's not surplus, that's there for a 

22

 very important reason, which is that someone can be in 

23

 lawful status and, therefore, be eligible for health 

24

 care, but then lose lawful status and at that point, 

25

 they can no longer be covered.  So, just none of that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

74
1
2

 works for them.  None of that works for them. 
 And  but to  really, to get to the 

3

 fundamental point here that both at the level of text, 

4

 you have clear irresolvable conflicts so that the 

5

 statute can't work if you read it Mr. Carvin's way.  You 

6

 have, at the level of text 

7

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is  is that a synonym 

 for ambiguity? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think so, exactly 

10

 right, Justice Scalia  I mean, excuse me, Justice 

11

 Kennedy 

12

 precisely because you have to  you know, this is a 

13

 statute that's going to operate one way or the other. 

14

 And the question is how it's going to operate.  And when 

15

 you read it their way, you 

16

that  that you have ambiguity there 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, if it's  if it's 

17

 ambiguous, then we think about Chevron.  But it seems to 

18

 me a drastic step for us to say that the Department of 

19

 Internal Revenue and its director can make this call one 

20

 way or the other when there are, what, billions of 

21

 dollars of subsidies involved here?  Hundreds of 

22

 millions? 

23

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes, there are billions 

24

 of dollars of subsidies involved here.  But two points 

25

 about that 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

75
1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And it  it seems to me 

2

 our cases say that if the Internal Revenue Service is 

3

 going to allow deductions using these, that it has to be 

4

 very, very clear. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So 
And it  it seems to me a 

7

 little odd that the director of Internal Revenue 

8

 didn't  didn't identify this problem if it's ambiguous 

9

 and advise Congress it was. 

10

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So a few points about 

11

 that with respect to Chevron deference.  First, we do 

12

 think Chevron deference clearly supports the government 

13

 here and I'll explain why.  But before you get to that, 

14

 you can resolve and should resolve this statute and the 

15

 statute's meaning in our favor even without resort to 

16

 Chevron deference.  That's what the canon of reading a 

17

 statute as a whole to make it work harmoniously directs 

18

 you to do.  It's what the very important principles of 

19

 Federalism that we've been describing here direct you to 

20

 do.  If you think there's a constitutional problem with 

21

 the statute, it's what the doctrine of constitutional 

22

 avoidance directs you to do. 

23

 Now, with respect to Chevron, Section 36B(g) 

24

 of the statute expressly delegates to the IRS the 

25

 specific authority to make any decisions necessary to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

76
1

 implement Section 36B.  So you don't have any ambiguity. 

2

 Congress said the IRS should do this.  It is a big 

3

 question, but as the Court said in City of Arlington two 

4

 terms ago, Chevron applies to big questions as well as 

5

 small. That Your Honor raised this point about the need for 

6

 clarity in  in a tax deduction and IRS in the 

7

 statutory reading of tax deductions, there is a learned 

8

 treatise that describes that as a false notion.  And it 

9

 is certainly not consistent with this Court's unanimous 

10

 decision in Mayo two terms ago that Chevron applies to 

11

 the tax code like anything else.  And so 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If you're right 

13

 if you're right about Chevron, that would indicate that 

14

 a subsequent administration could change that 

15

 interpretation? 

16

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think a subsequent 

17

 administration would need a very strong case under step 

18

 two of the Chevron analysis that that was a reasonable 

19

 judgment in view of the disruptive consequences.  So as 

20

 I said, I think you can resolve and should resolve this 

21

 case because the statute really has to be read when 

22

 taken as a whole to adopt the government's position. 

23

 But I do take 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

General 
If there are any  if there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

77
1

 are any tax attorneys in the  in the courtroom today, 

2

 I think probably they wrote down what you just said. And 

3

 when we get future tax cases, the United States is going 

4

 to argue that we should not read them to  you know, 

5

 there should be no presumption that a tax credit is 

6

 provided by that statute. 

7

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

You should  you should 

8

 read it according to its terms.  And when you read this 

9

 provision according to its terms and you read it in 

10

 context and you read it against the background 

11

 principles of Federalism, you have to affirm the 

12

 government's interpretation.  Thank you. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, General. 

 Four minutes, Mr. Carvin. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

17

 MR. CARVIN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

18

 Very quickly on standing. 

Mr. Hurst would 

19

 be subject to a penalty absent relief by this Court for 

20

 2014.  As I've discussed, both he and Mrs. Leevy, of 

21

 course, would face the same principle for 2015.  If the 

22

 government is suggesting that their case has become moot 

23

 because of changed circumstances, under Cardinal 

24

 Chemical 508 U.S. (8)(3), it's their burden to raise it, not 

25

 ours to supplement the record.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

78

 In terms of the anomaly, in terms of all the 

2

 States losing  34 States losing their Medicaid funds, 

3

 the Solicitor General greatly distorted the statute. 

4

 It's printed at 64A of their exhibit.  It says, "a State 

5

 shall establish procedures," so the notion that HHS 

6

 established them is obviously contrary to that.  It 

7

 says, "the State will identify people to enroll on their 

8

 Exchanges."  Well, they can't enroll anybody on their 

9

 Exchanges if there are no such Exchanges in the State. 

10

 Therefore, by the plain language, if you 

11

 adopt the notion that "Exchange established by the 

12

 State" means established by HHS, all of them need to 

13

 lose their Medicaid funding. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could I follow up on 

15

 something the General ended with, which  and Justice 

16

 Kennedy referred to, which is the need to read subsidies 

17

 limited.  But so is  in a limited way.  But so is the 

18

 need to ensure that exemptions from tax liability are 

19

 read in a limited way.  And under your reading, we're 

20

 giving more exemptions to employers not to provide 

21

 insurance, more exemptions to States and others or to 

22

 individuals, how  how does that work?  I mean, you've 

23

 got two competing 

24
25

 MR. CARVIN: 

No, no.  You do get more 

 exemptions for employers under our reading, but  and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

79
1

 the same principle applies.  Is it unambiguous?  It's 

2

 undisputed that that one is unambiguous. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well 
The dispute here is whether or 

5

 not if they win under ambiguity, and they don't because 

6

 the canon requires unambiguous statutes not to afford 

7

 the tax credit.  In terms of the employer mandate, I 

8

 think that's very helpful in terms of Justice Kennedy's 

9

 concern about Federalism.  Under their view of the 

10

 statute, the Federal government gets to unilaterally 

11

 impose on States  there's an amicus from Indiana 

12

 describing this  a requirement that States insure 

13

 their own individuals.  It implies the employer mandate 

14

 to States.  So their  under their theory, the States 

15

 are absolutely helpless to stop this Federal 

16

 intervention into their most basic personnel practices. 

17

 Whereas under our theory, they are able to say, no.  So 

18

 actually, the more intrusive view of the statute is 

19

 theirs. 

20

 In terms of the funding condition, head on, 

21

 Your Honor, I think my short answer is as follows: 

22

 There's no way to view this statute as more coercive or 

23

 harmful than the Medicaid  version of Medicaid that 

24

 was approved by this Court in NFIB and, indeed, the NFIB 

25

 dissenting opinion pointed to this provision as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

80
1

 something that was an acceptable noncoercive 

2

 alternative.  But in all events, even if there's a 

3

 constitutional doubt under a novel constitutional 

4

 question, as Justice Scalia pointed out, there's no 

5

 alternative reading of the statute that  that avoids 

6

 that, because either way, you're intruding on State 

7

 sovereignty. 

8
9

 In terms of the anomaly, in terms of 
 qualified individuals, as predicted, Solicitor General 

10

 did not come up here and tell you, yes, if we prevail 

11

 here under this theory, they're going to have to empty 

12

 out the HHS Exchanges.  Nor did he even respond to my 

13

 argument that with respect to an Exchange under the 

14

 definitional section only applies to State Exchanges. 

15

 So I think we can view this as  as a complete 

16

 tendentious litigation position and not a serious 

17

 statutory interpretation. 

18

 In terms of the qualified health plan that 

19

 he discussed with you, Justice Alito, the complete 

20

 answer to that is that is in 1311. 

21

 1311 only is talking about State established 

22

 Exchanges.  It has no application to HHS Exchanges, 

23

 therefore, it can't possibly create an anomaly with 

24

 respect to those HHS Exchanges.
