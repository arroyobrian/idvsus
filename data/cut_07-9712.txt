CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument first today in Case 07-9712, Puckett v. United

5

States.

Mr. Isaacson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARS R. ISAACSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. ISAACSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
This case is framed by two major facts:

12

Jimmy Puckett pled guilty and waived his fundamental

13

right to trial in exchange for a promise by the

14

government that they agreed he was qualified for a

15

three-level reduction in his offense level; and the

16

government of the United States breached this promise.

17

The teachings of this Court in this

18

situation are instructive.

19

must be voluntary and intelligent.

20

For a plea to be valid, it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Isaacson, you said

21

there were two facts.

22

fact that after the plea bargain the defendant in

23

essence broke his side of the bargain by committing a

24

crime while he was in jail?

25

Aren't there three?

MR. ISAACSON:

No, Your Honor.
3

Isn't it a

He did not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

breach the plea agreement by doing that.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He -

Well, I used to teach

3

contract law and I'll tell you that would have been a

4

breach of contract.

5

his part.

6

That would have been a breach on

Now, the government has conceded the breach

7

of the plea agreement.

I don't -- I can't understand

8

why they did that, but they apparently have conceded it.

9

Does that mean that we have to ignore it for purposes of

10

deciding what the -- what the remedy is?

11

reality that there was a breach?

12

if the government said, we will ask the court to

13

sentence at the lower end because of the -- the remorse

14

that the defendant has shown, and the defendant then

15

demonstrates that he has no remorse by -- you know,

16

suppose he comes and stabs the judge -- is the

17

government really supposed to have to go before the

18

judge and say, "Your Honor, this man is really

19

remorseful and you should sentence him at the lower

20

end"?

21

Ignore the

I mean, you know,

It seems to me it's a basic principle of

22

contract law that a party to a contract cannot take

23

action which makes it impracticable for the other side

24

to carry out his part of the bargain, and that's what

25

your client did.

The government couldn't practicably go
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in and make that argument when he had demonstrated

2

himself to be an unremorseful criminal.

3

MR. ISAACSON:

The government in this case

4

drafted a plea agreement, and most plea agreements --

5

I've practiced in the Northern District of Texas quite

6

often, and virtually every plea agreement has a

7

provision in it that says if the defendant does some

8

type of criminal activity, thus it will render it void.

9

This plea agreement did not have that in it.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. ISAACSON:

12

Oh.
So it's different than most

plea agreements.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you want to us make the

14

inference that the impermissible or criminal activity

15

was permitted by the absence of this specific clause.

16

You say there is no implied condition, no implied

17

covenant?

18

MR. ISAACSON:

Well, I'm not -- what we are

19

saying is the government needs to obey the promise in

20

the plea agreement.

21

is -

22

The promise in the plea agreement

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the questions so far

23

indicate that one of the promises was an implied promise

24

that you will keep the terms of the agreement by lawful

25

behavior.

So that just -- what you say just begs the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question.

2

Now, I recognize the government has conceded

3

a breach, and we will probably move on from that point.

4

But, as Justice Scalia indicates, it puts the case in a

5

very artificial posture, it seems to me.

6

MR. ISAACSON:

It is -- well, it is up to

7

the judge to determine whether or not the defendant gets

8

the acceptance points or not.

9

that Mr. Puckett would get the points, but that the

The bargain here was not

10

government would agree that he was qualified to receive

11

those points.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And there is nothing

13

theoretically inconsistent with the government -- you

14

can feel remorse.

15

again.

16

but that doesn't mean he didn't feel remorse from the

17

crime he was pleading to.

18

MR. ISAACSON:

I mean, you're not going to do it

You going to feel remorse every time you do it,

Yes, 3E1.1.

There is a

19

number of different factors that go into whether or not

20

someone gets the acceptance points.

21

discretion to give those points and there are a number

22

of different factors that go into it.

23

termination of criminal activity is one 1 of those

24

factors the court looks at, but it's not the only one.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It is the judge's

me that I would give acceptance of responsibility credit

to someone that as soon as he gets sent to jail is out

4

there committing another crime."

5

MR. ISAACSON:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He said:

"Unheard to

7

He said it was unknown to him that judges give

acceptance of responsibility credit to someone who in

12

MR. ISAACSON:

That is what Judge Sanders

did say.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Your point is not that he

should have gotten the reduction.

the government should have made the recommendation.

18

Your point is that

Isn't that your

point?

19

MR. ISAACSON:

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.
The agreement called for

21

them to make a recommendation and they didn't make it.

22

In fact, they recommended the contrary.

MR. ISAACSON:

And that's your

They just agreed he was entitled to his

There was two parts of the plea agreement.

5

The first part that they agreed to was, you know, that

lower in the guideline range.

9

The first part was not They

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you.
I suppose Justice

19

Ginsburg's point is relevant, though, on the question of

20

prejudice.

21

care what the government says, I am not going to give

22

anybody a departure when they have committed another

23

crime, then you haven't been prejudiced by the

24

government's breach.

25

If the judge gets up there and says, I don't

MR. ISAACSON:

Well -- I believe he has been
8


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prejudiced by the government's breach, because once the

2

government violates the plea agreement on the first

3

level, as we know under the prior precedents of this

4

case, it makes the actual plea agreement void.

5

secondly, the Santobello case clearly talks about it is

6

not important the effect on the sentencing judge

7

what the -- in Santobello the government breached a plea

agreement and the judge said:

9

And

It doesn't matter the

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

This

Well, the judge would have

13

known about what happened anyway from -- from the

14

presentence investigation, wouldn't he?

MR. ISAACSON:

I guess the point I am trying to make is the

agreement here was not that Judge Sanders would give him

acceptance points.

19

position -- and I should point out that Mr. Puckett, he

20

gave up all his rights just for this slim reed of hope.

21

Correct.

The fact is the government made the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he could have, if he

22

felt that way -- I mean, there they were in the

23

courtroom; all of them knew about the plea agreement

24

25

taken, right?

I'm sorry, ma'am.

Yes.
-- it was the same judge,

wasn't it?

8

MR. ISAACSON:

Yes, Judge Sanders.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so they were all

10

there and the defendant was asked all these questions,

11

and the government--

12

government's side of the plea bargain.

and the judge knew about the

13

MR. ISAACSON:

Right, yes.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it was not a secret to

15

anyone that the government said it would ask for the

16

extra acceptance of responsibility credit.

17

defendant and his lawyer stand there and they don't say

18

a word:

19

there was no motion to withdraw the plea, was there?

20

Wait a minute, judge.

MR. ISAACSON:

And yet the

They didn't object at -

Mr. Puckett had made a motion

21

prior to the sentencing to withdraw his plea on his own.

22

He basically pro se had done that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. ISAACSON:

During the sentencing, no,

there was not.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so that's why we are

-- if he had asked to withdraw the plea, then we'd have

a different case.

Our point is that we suggest

plain error shouldn't be applied to this case.

But Santobello was a case

where there was a timely objection.

14

MR. ISAACSON:

That is correct, but the

15

principles of whether or not when the government

16

breaches a plea agreement that renders the underlying

17

conviction void raises it to a different level.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why should that be the case?

19

I know plea agreements are not strictly governed by

20

contract law, but there is an analogy and your whole

21

argument seems to be that the government's breach

rendered the plea agreement void.

most errors that occur at trial?

3

MR. ISAACSON:

I would suggest it goes to

4

the very heart of whether or not he actually pled.

5

Justice Ginsburg's raised a great point about what Judge

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. ISAACSON:

Right.

Mr. Puckett would like the

plea agreement to be set aside and be allowed to take

11

this case to trial.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which would expose him to

a considerably greater penalty.

14

MR. ISAACSON:

Potentially, yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wouldn't it suffice to

16

give your client everything that he was entitled to if

17

the case were remanded to a different judge and the

May I ask essentially two

18

questions.

this is an unusual agreement, and that some of the

provisions were negotiated and the record shows they

were -- they were deliberately undertaken.

unusual.

8

its brief indicated it could have included it in there.

The government in its breach -- sorry -- in

9
10

I think it's fair to say it's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It did include it in the

motion, didn't they?

11

MR. ISAACSON:

It was -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. ISAACSON:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't there a motion -

Yes.
-- for credit for

15

acceptance of responsibility, and had as a condition

16

that the defendant be law-abiding?

17

MR. ISAACSON:

Yes, that was included in the

18

motion filed the next day for the additional point, that

19

is correct.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So isn't it odd that the

21

-- that these documents both meant to serve the same

22

purpose, one has the provision for law-abiding conduct

23

in the future and the other doesn't?

24

MR. ISAACSON:

5

So they are

Certainly they have different, I would

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But going back to my

6

question, isn't it a likely explanation for the

7

defendant's lawyer's failure to object that he just

8

didn't realize this agreement didn't have this normal

9

provision in it?

10

MR. ISAACSON:

I -- I can't.

As to

11

whether -- I would suggest that it is -- this is a -

12

normally, these are normally included in these

13

agreements, I would suggest to you.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. ISAACSON:

Right.

But I would suggest to you

16

also that it was not included in this agreement, and

17

since the government drafted it I don't think we can

18

just assume it should be there.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

But the other thing I wanted to ask you:

21

the term "void."

22

plea agreement renders it void rather than subject to

23

some kind of other remedy?

24
25

No, I understand that.
You keep using

Do our cases say that any breach of a

MR. ISAACSON:

Well, if it is -- I think the

5

Recently in the Bousley,

Statements in there can't go; not good if it's

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But those are cases that

6

say that the remedy is setting aside the -- the guilty

7

plea, but they don't characterize the -- the agreement

8

as having become void, if I -- if I remember correctly.

9

MR. ISAACSON:

Well, again, I am -- citing

10

from Machibroda:

11

or threats which would deprive it of a private or

12

voluntary act are void.

13

A guilty plea, if induced by promises

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but those -- that

14

goes to the integrity of the guilty plea, not to whether

15

or not the underlying contract became void, I think.

16

Maybe I'm missing something.

17

MR. ISAACSON:

Well, I -- I think what we

18

are saying is once the government takes its action, it

19

deprives the plea of its voluntary character.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't -- it doesn't

21

retroactively render the government's promise a

22

misrepresentation.

23

contract fails to comply with a contract, he hasn't been

24

guilty of fraud.

25

government had no intention of complying with it when -

Every time a -- a party to a

"Misrepresentation" would mean the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

when it entered into it, and you -- you don't assert

2

that was the case, do you?

3

MR. ISAACSON:

No, but I would suggest that

4

Santobello again talks about the intent, whether or not

5

-- in that case there were two prosecutors who didn't

6

know what one -- the other one was doing, and this Court

7

said that's not important; it is the integrity of the

8

plea that's important and the government's breach

9

thereof.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under the law of contracts

11

I assume -- I haven't looked it up yet -- that you can't

12

rescind for a nonmaterial breach.

13

doesn't always allow recision.

14

the district court said:

16

Well So it seems to me an

MR. ISAACSON:

for me to understand.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was part of this

14

agreement that was honored.

In fact, the judge after

having said that, I never heard of giving credit for

16

responsibility to somebody who commits a crime in the

17

plain error, rather than calling it to the attention of

If the government breach In other words, your

position is -- is kind of a theoretical formalistic

position, that -- I'm not sure if this is the wrong

plea, and even though things turn out as well to him as

the right to withdraw from the plea even if there is no

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA H. SCHERTLER

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18

MS. SCHERTLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
When the government breaches a plea

19

agreement, an objection made in the district court

20

serves important purposes that relate to the functioning

21

of Federal courts.

22

the parties to determine whether a breach has occurred,

23

and it also, in many cases, may permit an immediate cure

24

of that breach to be administered, obviating the need

25

for appellate review of the issue altogether.

It permits the district court and

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

A central purpose of the contemporaneous

2

objection rule is to ensure that the district court

3

proceedings are as free of error as possible.

4

purpose is served in this context, the plea breach

5

context, as it is in others.

6

And that

Rule 52(b) reinforces the contemporaneous

7

objection rule by placing a heavier burden on the party

8

who does not object in the district court to win relief

9

on appeal.

10

The government's submission to the court

11

today is that the plain-error standard does apply to

12

forfeited claims that a plea agreement has been

13

breached, that the Olano framework should be followed,

14

and that one component of the plain-error showing in

15

this context should require a defendant who did not

16

object to a breach in the district court to show a

17

reasonable probability that the outcome of the

18

proceeding was affected by the breach.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just to explore the issue

20

of breach for a moment, suppose hypothetically, same

21

facts here, but it is all vented and discussed and aired

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Excuse me, were you --

3

Justice Kennedy, were you through?

4

you started a question again.

5

I'm sorry, I thought

The problem I have with the harmless error

6

suggestion that you've made is this.

If the government

7

does engage in some breach of the agreement, it seems to

8

me the consequence is that an individual has given up a

9

trial and as a consequence of that has given up liberty,

10

without either the trial that he is entitled to or

11

fulfillment of the conditions for giving up the liberty.

12

And isn't there -- isn't there a very high

13

value to be placed on the fact that nobody in the United

14

States under the constitutional guarantees should be -

15

should be sitting behind bars without either a

16

conviction following full trial, invocation of whatever

17

rights he wants to invoke, or a voluntary agreement to

18

be behind bars?

19

conditions is fulfilled, don't we have an error that as

20

a matter of constitutional law cannot be regarded as

21

harmless.

22

And -- and when neither of those

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, there -- certainly I

23

agree, Justice Souter, that -- and although there is

24

distinguishable facts in Santobello, that that theme is

25

present in Santobello as well.

And the Court there said

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that it was not -- at the very least, the Court said

2

when the government has not fulfilled its promise and an

3

objection is raised and the defendant has suffered an

4

adverse consequence that was somehow related to the

5

government's broken promise, that the Court is not going

6

to find harmlessness simply based on the district

7

court's statement itself that it didn't rely on what the

8

government had said.

9

Now, we would submit, however, that there

10

could be cases -- and the Chief Justice's hypothetical

11

would have one of those -- where even in a setting where

12

an objection is raised, if the defendant receives the

13

benefit that was the aim of the promise he secured from

14

the government -- for instance, if in Santobello the

15

defendant there received the lowest possible sentence

16

that he might have gotten -- that in that circumstance,

17

Santobello should not preclude harmless error review,

18

and the defendant cannot be said to have -- to be in

19

jail having not received the benefit.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I -- I think I would agree

21

with you there because, by whatever means, the defendant

22

has gotten everything the defendant bargained for.

23

MS. SCHERTLER:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

Yes, Justice Souter.

circuitous route, but he got it all.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But in the case when,

3

unlike the Chief Justice's hypothetical, when we don't

4

know that, when we -- the judge sort of keeps his

5

thoughts to himself or herself, then don't we have the

6

-- the problem of the -- the individual behind bars,

7

neither as a result of trial nor as a result of the deal

8

that he made?

9

MS. SCHERTLER:

I agree that is -- that is

10

the strong suggestion of Santobello when there has been

11

an objection made.

13

made in the district court.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We would -- we would submit to the

Doesn't -- whether we

15

accept that proposition or not that the analysis must

16

differ, doesn't that really depend on -- on what value

17

we place on the importance of the proposition that I

18

started with?

19

a result of a valid conviction after trial or a

20

voluntary agreement that says, yeah, I will stay there.

21

And if -- if we place a very high value on the liberty

22

interest -- in -- in retaining liberty except under

23

those two conditions, then isn't it fair to us -- isn't

24

it sensible for us to say even in a plain-error

25

situation, we are going to recognize this -- this kind

If somebody's behind bars, it's either as

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

of prejudice, despite the fact that he didn't object?

2

If we place a high value on the liberty interest, we

3

wouldn't accept your position; isn't that fair?

4

MS. SCHERTLER:

The high value that the

5

Court placed on the liberty interest in that situation

6

would also have to be to the exclusion of other very

7

important interests that are served by making sure that

8

objections are raised in the district court.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You are right, there is no

10

question about it.

a -- a less efficient process, a process less efficient

4

That would create incentives on the part of defendants

5

to -- to withhold objections.

6

No -- no question, but it

7

seems to me that the answer to that is, it's an

8

incentive that would never come into play if the

government kept its word.

10

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So why -- why should -- why

12

is the government really in a position to object to

13

that?

14

MS. SCHERTLER:

Because this Court has

15

the -- what it permits is manipulation of the system by

16

-- by counsel, really.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You're talking about

18

manipulation of the system.

19

government wasn't manipulating the system when they said

20

we should grant cert in this case.

21

agree that the cert should be granted.

22

MS. SCHERTLER:

23
24
25

I just wonder if the

You did -- you did

Oh, we did acquiesce, yes.

Yes, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

And are you taking the

position that -- that every case, that the absence of
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

objection would always be controlling?

2

MS. SCHERTLER:

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The For example, in this

4

particular case, it seems to me that if the -- if you

5

had an objection and if the judge had agreed with the

6

objection and said I will set aside the plea because of

7

adopting the arguments of your opponent, I think the

8

government would have appealed, and said that that

9

decision is so wrong and it's because it's really

10

harmless error.

11

whether there's harmless error available, rather than

12

turning anything on whether or not an objection was made

13

in the district court.

14

I think here the real question is

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, but this -- this is

15

the question on which the circuits had divided, and

16

which is why we acquiesced in this case to sort through

17

that question.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But in talking about the

19

division of the circuits, do you think all breaches of

20

-- of plea agreements should be governed by precisely

21

the same standard?

22

facts in different cases?

23

Or do you think there are varying

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, I think that the

24

analysis of a breach in each case will differ and it

25

first and it will in the -- first and foremost depend
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

upon what the standard of appellate review is and

2

whether an objection has preserved, in which case it

3

would be the government's burden to show that a breach

4

is harmless, or in the plain-error sentencings the -

5

the burdens are reversed; and we think the -- the

6

ordinary rules codified in rule 52(a) and (b) apply in

7

this context equally.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's clear, isn't

it, that the defendant in this case was in fact

10

prejudiced?

The judge -- Judge Sanders said it's very

11

rare, he said, that you would depart -- or I

12

forget whether it's depart or -

13

MS. SCHERTLER:

So rare as to be unknown.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So rare -- I thought

15

he said "rare to unknown," "to be unknown" -- you are

16

right.

17

MS. SCHERTLER:

Yes.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I suspect it's

19

probably rarer still for the government to recommend

20

that.

21

done this or he certainly wouldn't have considered it.

22

It's one thing to say I've never heard of that.

23

another thing when one of your colleagues is there

24

saying, this is what you should do.

25

So you can't really say that he wouldn't have

MS. SCHERTLER:

It's

The -- let me respond to
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that immediate point.

2

yes, if the government were to recommend that he

3

received acceptance of responsibility in this situation,

4

that may be considered significant; but the district

5

court judge would also know that it was in fulfillment

6

of a promise that was made before renewed criminal

7

activity occurred from jail.

8

circumstance -

9

Which is -- my response would be,

And so, given that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but none of us

10

can know what the judge would have done.

11

have had cases here where the government's

12

recommendation of downward departures has been pretty

13

surprising to me as well, and it's because they were

14

informants or whatever and they have engaged in some

15

pretty bad conduct; and I don't know what Judge Sanders

16

would have done.

17

MS. SCHERTLER:

I mean, we

And here under the plain

18

error standard it was the defendant's burden to show a

19

reasonable probability that something different would

20

have happened.

21

this record that the record showed that nothing

22

different would have happened, even had the government

23

complied with its promise.

24
25

The court of appeals made findings on

JUSTICE BREYER:
we say the following?

Looking at this, why can't

Some circuits have said that they
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

will never recognize plain error, when it's a breach of

2

a plea agreement.

3

error like any other kind of a case, every other kind of

4

issue.

5

one hand, all they did, the promise was the government

6

agreed to request that his sentence be placed at the

7

lowest end, and they followed it.

8

they made no promise.

9

demonstrated acceptance of responsibility.

Sure.

That's wrong.

It could be plain

But the error here isn't plain.

On the

In the other part

They simply agreed that he had
And then

10

what they did at the trial, they said, "we don't want

11

him to get acceptance of responsibility at this point."

12

Now, some people could argue that here is an

13

implicit promise in paragraph 1, not to say something at

14

the trial that is contrary to their recognition in

15

paragraph 8.

16

you could argue that there is implicit, also, a promise

17

not to implicitly do the first implicit, if what he has

18

done in the meantime is commit another serious crime.

That's where it is.

On the other hand,

19

So we have two arguments, one of which says

20

they committed error, and one of which says they didn't

21

commit error; and the argument turns on two implicit

22

readings of paragraph 8.

23

End of case.

24
25

Therefore, it is not plain.

What's wrong with that?

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, the -- the government

has conceded, and I don't 42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I mean, the

2

government would like a whole lot of questions answered.

3

So what I don't see is how the government can come here

4

because they want a lot of questions answered, and get

5

us to take the case, which I'm not sure was a wonderful

6

idea; maybe it was.

7

they want us to say, no, no, don't take the obvious

8

response to it because we would like you to answer five

9

other questions.

10
11

But then we take the case, and now

So what I want to know is, what's wrong with
what I said?

12

Is that a possible outcome?

MS. SCHERTLER:

That is a possible outcome,

13

Justice Breyer, and clarification for -- from this Court

14

that the plain-error standard does apply to this type of

15

error as it does to others would certainly help to

16

resolve the conflict that does exist out there in the

17

courts of appeal.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I may have gotten

19

lost in the dialogue.

As you understand it,

20

Justice Breyer's suggestion was that you win, right?

21

You get plain error, and then sometimes you apply it and

22

it comes out one way, and sometimes you apply it the

23

other.

24

MS. SCHERTLER:

Yes.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, Chief Justice.

43
Alderson Reporting Company

So you are happy to

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

go along that.

2

MS. SCHERTLER:

Yes.

The -- it does not

3

give the courts all of the guidance that would be

4

helpful as to how to apply other components of the

5

plain-error standard in this context.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's a big

7

difference, right?

As you said earlier, harmless error,

8

the government has the burden; plain error, the

9

defendant has the burden.

That's certainly going to

10

change how you approach however many different factual

11

contexts.

12

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, yes, Mr. Chief

13

Justice.

14

seemed to us a good vehicle to address these questions

15

is that they was agreement throughout the appellate

16

process that there was an error that was plain and,

17

therefore, it provides an opportunity to address -- if

18

the Court chooses, which it need not, but if the Court

19

chooses -- to address how the substantial rights aspect

20

of the plain-error standard and discretionary aspect -

21

I mean, what -- the reason that this case

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that the

22

government has tried to pick a case in which it has the

23

strongest opportunity to win on the merits in order to

24

have us decide a rule that really isn't important in a

25

lot of other cases, but it is totally unimportant in
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this case.

2

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, Justice Stevens, what

3

one finds when one looks through a lot of these -- when

4

these cases are brought, there often is a dispute and a

5

real -- and a genuine dispute as to whether a breach has

6

occurred or not.

7

allow exposition -- explanation about the other

8

components.

9

And those cases, of course, do not

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But don't you think it

10

would have been open to the government to make the

11

argument that Justice Breyer has made and said there

12

really wasn't a breach here, at least an insignificant

13

breach that should be ignored?

14

MS. SCHERTLER:

As we acknowledge in our

15

brief, there might be arguments out there that there

16

were implicit terms to this plea agreement that were

17

breached by the defendant.

18

made in the court of appeals in this case, and so we are

19

accepting that record as a way -

20

Those arguments were never

JUSTICE BREYER:

They can only get -- they

21

can only get your breach if they find an implicit

22

agreement.

23

tell the court that, in light of changes, paragraph 8 no

24

longer describes the situation.

25

paragraph 8, as taken literally.

The implicit agreement is that you will not

You didn't breach
You agree he had shown

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

that acceptance of responsibility.

2

court was, now we don't think he should have this

3

acceptance of responsibility, which previously he had

Those are

Now, he may have made an implicit not to do

7

that.

8

negative by, you know, the other implicit acceptance of

9

the fact that this applies only where we don't commit

10

On the other hand, that implicit promise may be

another crime.

11

So I'm just saying this -- I'm not saying

you are even right.

13

arguments, it seems that you aren't plainly wrong.

14

aren't plainly wrong.

that the government agrees to request that Puckett's

8

sentence placed at the lowest end of the guideline

10

been no claim, at any point in this proceeding, that

11

that provision has been breached.

that the lowest end of the guideline is appropriate, and

I intend to follow that.

a matter of some disagreement, but -- I mean, we have 47
Alderson Reporting Company

we have taken the position that this was a breach of the

2

government's agreement that he qualified for a

three-level reduction in his offense level.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

before the judge.

8

it."

that he's gone out and done this again."

You could say, "And by the way, you should know
But you most

10

-- you certainly prejudiced him by not doing what you

11

said you would do.

12

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, we breached the

13

agreement by not doing what we said we would do, and the

14

question we would submit to the Court is whether, given

15

the absence of an objection, Petitioner carried his

16

burden of showing that we did prejudice him.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the -

No, but isn't it the

fact that we can never know what Judge Sanders would

have done if the government had what it said it would

do.

showing there is no prejudice when you can't tell

22

because you're the one that breached the agreement?

23

And because -- why shouldn't you bear the burden of

MS. SCHERTLER:

Because in the plain-error

24

setting, this Court has made clear that the burdens

25

shift and that, under the third component of that
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

standard, it is the defendant's burden, if he did not

2

object, to show an effect on the outcome of the

3

proceeding, that his substantial rights were violated.

4

And here -- and I would note that the court

5

of appeals made findings that the result would have been

6

the same, and Petitioner in this Court has never

7

challenged those findings on this record.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you say just for me,

because I am changing a little bit here in light of that

10

question, but what is it precisely that the government

11

said it would do that it did not do?

12
13

16

MS. SCHERTLER:

The -- paragraph 8 of the

plea agreement indicates that the government JUSTICE BREYER:

What does it say?

What are

the words that it says the government did not do?
MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, we indicated to the

17

20

of responsibility.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And paragraph 8 was a

So he did agree.

"We

22

agreed that he does qualify."

23

24

qualifies at this point.

MS. SCHERTLER:

was -- and there an intervening event, obviously, that

affected the judgment, but because the explicit

provision of this particular plea agreement, which I

agree is atypical, as the government's motion for the

is why it makes sense to apply the plain-error standard

in this context.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the fact is that, in

Well, could the breach have

7

been cured?

I mean, the point -- it seems to me, the

8

point at which the defendant would have known that the

9

government had breached the agreement was when the

10

government stood there before the court and said, "In

11

fact, he hasn't accepted responsibility.

12

and committed another crime while he was behind bars."

13

He went out

It seems to me that that's the point -- and

14

maybe this phrase occurred somewhere in the record -

15

that that's a bell that you can't unring.

16

defendant to get up and object and said, "Wait a minute,

17

were you supposed to represent to the court that you

18

agreed that I did accept responsibility" -- to require

the government to fulfill that undertaking at that point

20

would have been ridiculous.

could have said, "Oh, yes, he's right, Judge.

that he accepted responsibility."

3

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, there would be more

than one way to cure a breach such as this, if an

And I don't think

Petitioner -- Petitioner even contends that he is

of this plea.

6

this Court proposed as one possibility in Santobello, I

don't think Petitioner would say that a judge should not

would give the same response, that it -- it is
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Petitioner's burden to show a likelihood, a reasonable

2

likelihood that it would have been different.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

With respect, that is not

4

what Olano says, is it?

The -- the -- the basic Olano

5

standard is a -- is a violation of substantial rights

6

standard.

7

MS. SCHERTLER:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, Justice Souter.
And one way that you could

show a violation of substantial rights would be a -- a

10

demonstration that the outcome would have been

11

different.

12

violation is -- is whether -- and I know you don't

13

accept it, but it's the one that I proposed earlier,

14

there is a violation of substantial rights if somebody

15

is sitting behind bars without having gotten there by

16

the performance of an agreement that he made, or as a

17

result of a trial.

Olano formulation, could it not?

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know you want to -- as I

point out one other thing to you.

I think it's a hard

54
Alderson Reporting Company

1

question, burden of proof and these other things, that I

2

just turned the page, after the person, Ms. Simms, she's

3

the prosecutor, and she's absolutely clear to me, others

4

can disagree, that this judge knew just what the

5

government had agreed to, and the prosecutor was saying

6

that now things have changed.

7

And then the judge turns to the probation

8

officer, and the probation officer says, just to

9

reiterate what Ms. Simms said, the new offense,

10

according to the guidelines of the guideline manual,

11

prohibits any acceptance of responsibility.

12

that turns out to be right, of course, it couldn't

matter less whose burden of proof it is.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

He wasn't -- was he

convicted of this new crime?
MS. SCHERTLER:

He -- not at the time of

these proceedings.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It was just an

allegation, right?
MS. SCHERTLER:

That's right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
anything anyway?

Why did we assume

I assume he denies the allegations.

MS. SCHERTLER:

He admitted the allegations

7

to the probation officer, and that is what was reflected

8

in the presentence report.

9

And if I could return to Justice Souter's

10

question about if the Court were to take the position

11

that a form of substantial rights is affected in every

12

case of a government breach of plea agreement, we would

13

respectfully submit that as this Court analyzed a

14

similar type of difficult question in Johnson and

15

Cotton, that the fourth discretionary component of the

16

standard should preclude relief or should at least give

17

the district court, the court of appeals discretion to

18

not grant relief where, as in this case, there has been

19

no showing that there was an effect on the outcome, and,

20

as the Court of Appeals found, an affirmative record

21

that the outcome would have been exactly the same.

Thank you, Your Honors.

We would ask that

the judgment be affirmed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LARS R. ISAACSON

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. ISAACSON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

5

The problem that the Puckett panel had in

the third prong of 52(b) they focused on whether or not

7

there is prejudice at sentencing.

8

the Puckett panel.

9

error applied and was found in that case.

10

That was the focus of

That is why they said 52(b) plain

The problem with that is that Santobello

11

clearly points out that prejudice to the trial judge,

12

that the trial judge -- what the trial judge would have

13

done is simply not relevant.

14

be applied in this case.

15

That is why 52(b) cannot

Secondly, when the government argues that

16

there is no prejudice -- you have to show prejudice at

17

sentencing, the judge would have done something

18

different, that is virtually an impossible standard.

19

Under 18 U.S.C. 355 -- there are a number of factors a

20

sentencing judge has to take into.

21

there is many different factors they must look at, all

22

of these different things.

23

The idea -- and

The idea that a defendant can somehow show a

24

judge would have come to a different result but for the

25

government breach is an impossibility.

1

The final point I would make is, the

2

argument the government is making now about prejudice,

3

it would make no difference at all if the defendant had

4

objected at the time.

5

sentencing, it would not pass muster under plain-error

6

or the harmless error standards.

7

objection, and then they're going to say the exact same

argument here.

Thank you, counsel.
