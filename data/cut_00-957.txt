ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLA J. STOVALL


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8
9

MS. STOVALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and


may it please the Court:


10

The Kansas Supreme Court has erroneously read


11

this Court's decision in Kansas v. Hendricks as requiring


12

a showing that a potentially sexually violent predator


13

cannot control his behavior and that such a requirement


14

has supplemented the two requisites for civil commitment


15

that this Court has approved in and since the Addington


16

case.

17

illness and dangerousness. 


18

Those two requirements, as you know, are mental


The volitional impairment that the Kansas


19

Supreme Court has ruled was constitutionally required for


20

civil commitment ignores the fact that psychological


21

disorders, such as antisocial personality, can impair an


22

individual in behavior, cognitive, perceptual, emotional,


23

and even intellectual capacities. 


24
25

This Court has never indicated that there's

anything constitutionally significant about a volitional

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

impairment. 


2

QUESTION:

There was a good deal of reference in


3

our Hendricks opinion to the -- to the apparent fact that


4

the person there had what was volitionally impaired. 


5

You're saying that was descriptive rather than essential


6

to the holding? 


7

MS. STOVALL:

I'm saying it was descriptive. 


8

Mr. Hendricks had apparently, and according to himself


9

only, an inability to control his own behavior.

So, when


10

the majority wrote about Mr. Hendricks, they used that


11

kind of a description. 


12

QUESTION:

Well, but we also relied on prior


13

authority that made some reference to lack of control. 
 I

14

don't think that what was done by the court below was


15

totally off the wall in light of what was said in our


16

prior cases.

17

not to that extent?

18

What if there is some element but perhaps

How would you draw the line?


MS. STOVALL:

Well, if this Court says that


19

there needs to be some volitional impairment displayed, we


20

would suggest that it just be merely some impairment.

21

have a total impairment is something that the


22

psychiatrists will even tell us is an impossible standard


23

to show. 


24
25

QUESTION:

To


You think that's the standard adopted


in the court below that we're reviewing?

1

MS. STOVALL:

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. STOVALL:

4

QUESTION:

I do. 


Total impairment? 

I do. 


Do you acknowledge that lack of


5

ability to control one's unlawful conduct and volitional


6

impairment are one and the same thing? 


7

MS. STOVALL:

8

QUESTION:

9

No, I do not. 


Suppose I'm delusional and -- and I


think that -- that people I see are Satan.

I'm fully able


10

to control myself and -- and do not attack people who are


11

not Satan, but I think that some people are Satan. 


12

MS. STOVALL:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Your Honor, that's --


Do you call that a lack of volitional


control or delusion? 

MS. STOVALL:

I would consider that delusional


16

and not a -- a lack of volitional control.

17

problem with the Kansas Supreme Court's decision is that


18

it says the only thing that we consider is volitional


19

impairment, but there are many kinds of impairments


20

individuals have that are the result of their mental


21

disorder, and so the Kansas court is necessarily limiting


22

the psychiatric diagnosis to say only volitional


23

impairment --


24
25

QUESTION:

And the


What is there -- I thought there


could be cognitive impairments.

I think Justice Scalia


5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has described one.

There could be emotional impairments.


2

MS. STOVALL:

3

QUESTION:

4

impairments.

5

Yes, sir. 


And there could be volitional


Now, is there any other category? 


MS. STOVALL:

Perceptual, intellectual.

There


6

-- there are many kinds that are talked about within the


7

psychiatric material. 


8

QUESTION:

But are these --


9

QUESTION:

Is there any kind relevant here other


10

than volition?


11
12

MS. STOVALL:

Yes.

I think they all are, all of


those that we mentioned, and perhaps even those --

Are relevant in this case? 


13

QUESTION:

14

MS. STOVALL:

15

QUESTION:

Not -- yes.


I'm saying is there any one relevant


16

to the particular individual at issue here other than


17

volition.


18

MS. STOVALL:

I don't believe psychiatrists can


19

tell us what it is that -- what kind of impairment Mr.


20

Crane has.

21

that psychiatrists can't tell whether or not Justice


22

Scalia was acting because he's hallucinating or because


23

it's some other volitional impairment, if it's an


24

irresistible impulse, if you will, whether it's emotional,


25

perceptual, intellectual.

They're not -- the -- the literature will say


They can't tell.

They can't


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

get in somebody's mind.

2

simply rely on what the individual says. 


3

And what they have to do then is


Mr. Crane told this -- the court below -- he


4

told the experts below, rather.

He didn't testify.

He


5

told the experts below that he could control his behavior. 


6

Mr. Hendricks had testimony that you refer to in the


7

Hendricks decision that said he couldn't control his


8

behavior.

9

determination objectively, we're left with a potential


So, because the psychiatrist can't make a


10

predator telling us who applies -- who's eligible for this


11

law and who isn't. 


12

The other point I would make to this Court is


13

that Mr. Hendricks said I can't control my urge to molest


14

children.

15

children in front of their parents, never in front of his


16

wife, never in front of law enforcement --


17

But he could.

QUESTION:

He never molested little


Well, but that's not the premise that


18

Hendricks proceeded upon.

19

that Hendricks rested on an insecure factual assumption.


20
21
22
23

MS. STOVALL:

Now you're -- now you're saying


I'm sorry, Your Honor.

I don't


understand. 

QUESTION:

Well, you're -- are you trying to say


that what we said in Hendricks was -- was dictum or --


24

MS. STOVALL:

25

QUESTION:

I --


-- just was -- was wrong in the -- in

7

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the context of that case? 


2

MS. STOVALL:

I'm certainly not saying you were


3

wrong, Your Honor.

4

third constitutional standard, that the impairments that


5

I --


6

I'm saying that you did not create a


QUESTION:

Well, was the Court under some


7

misimpression as -- as to Hendricks' ability to control


8

himself? 


9

MS. STOVALL:

There wasn't evidence before this


10

Court that would say whether or not Hendricks suffered


11

from a volitional impairment or not.

12

he himself said. 


All we have is what


13

QUESTION:

But then, it seems to me, that we're


14

back to square one.

I -- one reading of Hendricks -- and


15

tell me if this is wrong -- is that we want to find some


16

measure of determining how dangerous this person is to


17

society because that's in the statute.

18

criminals are -- have personality disorders and are


19

dangerous to society, we want to narrow it somewhat.

20

we -- so the Court added this volitional control aspect.


21

Is that a fair reading of Hendricks?


22

MS. STOVALL:

And because many


So,


Your Honor, I don't believe it is


23

because Mr. Hendricks, in particular, didn't suffer from a


24

personality disorder.

25

Kansas statute as an abnormality mentally and that was


He had what is classified under the


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

being pedophilia.

2

there are two kinds of impairment that we could look at. 


3

They're emotional as well as volitional. 


4

QUESTION:

The Kansas statute specifically says


Well, is the test -- are there


5

different requirements if you proceed based on a


6

personality disorder than if you proceed from a mental


7

abnormality? 


8
9
10

MS. STOVALL:

think there is because there is no definition in the

statute of a personality disorder.

11
12

Well, the Kansas court seems to


QUESTION:

It wasn't defined --


Well, I was -- I was suggesting that


you thought there was based on the answer you gave to me.


13

MS. STOVALL:

14

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

What --


You think they're both one and the


15

same.

16

abnormality or personality disorder.

17

case, the test for civil commitment is the same.


18
19
20

You have no different requirements for mental


MS. STOVALL:

In -- in either


Based on the Kansas Supreme Court


decision or based on the --

QUESTION:

Based on what you think the law ought


21

to be and what the -- and how the statute is properly


22

interpreted. 


23

MS. STOVALL:

We believe there is no


24

distinction.

There should be no distinction between


25

mental abnormality and personality disorder, that as long

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as we -- we show that mental condition and the


2

dangerousness, that there should not be a distinction.


3

QUESTION:

So, anybody with a personality


4

disorder that's a danger to himself or others can be --


5

can be civilly committed regardless of volitional control. 


6

That's -- that's your position. 


7

MS. STOVALL:

Right.

They have to have some


8

sort of impairment in order to have the diagnosis of a


9

personality disorder.

That's part and parcel of a


10

diagnosis of the DSM.

But it would be our position it's


11

not limited to volitional control, but could be that


12

laundry list of emotional capacity -- emotional


13

impairment, which is even what the Kansas statute


14

contemplates for mental --


15

QUESTION:

-- the DSM that you're mentioning, if


16

you look at the definition of personality disorder and


17

they say pick three out of a list of seven, you could pick


18

out habitually doesn't work, doesn't pay debts, is


19

reckless, irritable.

20

considerably less than what is defined as an abnormality


21

like pedophilia.

22

would fit that description. 


23

That's something -- I mean, it's


There are a lot of ordinary people who


MS. STOVALL:

What -- what I want to be able to


24

do today, Your Honors, is to convince you that actually


25

that's not true, that an antisocial personality disorder

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is a severe mental pathology that really does give us


2

sociopaths and psychopaths that cannot conform to our


3

rules.

4

certainly in our prisons that break the law, and they may


5

suffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's


6

entirely separate and distinct from having a full-blown


7

diagnosis of an antisocial personality disorder.


There are a lot of individuals in this country and


8
9

QUESTION:

Well, your statute itself, when


you're talking about a sexually violent predator, you say


10

mental abnormality or personality disorder, which makes


11

the person likely to engage in repeat acts of sexual


12

violence.

So, that certainly qualifies the personality


13

disorder.

It's not any personality disorder that would do


14

that. 


15

MS. STOVALL:

That's exactly right, Your Honor. 


16

The point is that it's a severe diagnosis, for one thing,


17

and then secondly, it has to tie directly to the kind of


18

dangerous behavior that we believe these individuals will


19

commit if they don't have the treatment. 


20

QUESTION:

And I take it what your -- what your


21

statute is trying to get at is -- is something more than


22

mere repetitive conduct, mere recidivism.

23

say? 


24

MS. STOVALL:

25

QUESTION:

Is that fair to


Absolutely. 


And -- and is the element that

11

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

distinguishes this kind of behavior from mere


2

repetitiveness some element of lack of control, not


3

necessarily volitional control, but some element of lack


4

of control, perhaps lack of control resulting from


5

delusion, perceptual difficulties and so on, but -- but


6

some -- some aspect of the personality that -- that gives


7

that individual a -- a lesser chance of controlling


8

behavior in -- in a way that avoids committing crimes.

9

that fair to say? 


10

MS. STOVALL:

With a slight exception.

Is


It's the


11

dangerousness, the risk of recidivism tied to a mental


12

disorder.

13

there will be an impairment that's part and parcel of


14

that.


To get the diagnosis of a mental disorder,


Right. 


15

QUESTION:

16

MS. STOVALL:

But I want to be clear that we


17

don't think there needs to be a -- a third separate, very


18

distinguishable constitutional element --


19

QUESTION:

I guess what I'm -- I guess what I'm


20

getting at is it -- it seems sensible to call somebody who


21

is just an habitual offender at some dangerous crime or


22

serious crime dangerous.

23

Kansas statute and other statutes like it is trying to get


24

at, by speaking of mental disorder or personality


25

disorder, is some extra element beyond the mere


And I take it that what the


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

probability of doing an act which society has called


2

dangerous.

3

And I think -- I think --

MS. STOVALL:

That's 100 percent accurate.


4

That's exactly where we are, Your Honor.

5

that having that mental abnormality or mental disorder


6

gets us away from just predicting who's going to be


7

dangerous. 


8
9

QUESTION:

And we think


But what is that -- what is that? 


That's exactly the issue.

What is it that you -- how --


10

what form of words will you use to define what counts as a


11

mental disorder that will distinguish the people whom you


12

want to civilly commit from your mine-run recidivist


13

criminal? 


14

MS. STOVALL:

15

QUESTION:

That they have to have a mental --


Yes, but what -- that's the problem


16

in the case.

The problem is what counts as a mental


17

disorder.

18

mental disorder is a total inability to control behavior.


And the Kansas court thought what counts as a


19

MS. STOVALL:

20

QUESTION:

21

definition.

22
23
24
25

That's correct. 


You say that's not the right


Very well.

MS. STOVALL:

What is? 

What is in the statute, a severe


mental --

QUESTION:

No, no.

What is the definition of


the word, mental disorder, that appears in the statute? 

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

If a person were to say every person who commits a crime,


2

15 times running, is a sociopath and thereby falls within


3

DSM-IV, you're not going to permit that.

4

distinguish that sociopath from a person who is really


5

mentally disordered and he isn't your mine-run criminal. 


6

All right.

7
8

11

Give me the form of words that will do it. 

MS. STOVALL:

I believe they are there now,


that --


9
10

You want to


QUESTION:

All that's there now is mental


disorder.

MS. STOVALL:

Well, actually it's mental


12

abnormality and personality disorder.

13

in the Hendricks decision said that pedophilia certainly


14

qualifies as a --


15

QUESTION:

You and this Court


Well, and here we have -- we have


16

here an antisocial personality disorder.

17

the diagnosis. 


18
19
20

MS. STOVALL:

That's right.

That -- that was


Along with


exhibitionism. 

QUESTION:

And the State's own expert said in


21

Mr. Crane's trial that approximately 75 percent of the


22

prison population has antisocial personality disorder.


23

Now, this is an unusual statute where after the


24

person serves a sentence for the crime, the State can then


25

proceed again and get them locked up for a very long time

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because of his dangerousness.


2

MS. STOVALL:

3

QUESTION:

And the mental disorder. 


We're trying -- okay.

But most of


4

them -- 75 percent of them was the testimony -- suffer


5

from antisocial personality disorder.

6

going to be able to proceed again against 75 percent of


7

the prison population?

8

an antisocial personality disorder? 


9

MS. STOVALL:

So, is the State


What is the added element beyond


I would suggest to you that there


10

doesn't need to be an additional element.

11

acknowledge the expert said 75 percent suffers from that


12

in the deposition, he wasn't -- he certainly didn't quote


13

empirical studies to demonstrate that.

14

that probably 90-95 percent of the prison population


15

suffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's


16

different than a disorder. 


17

While I


I would suggest


The antisocial personality disorder, psychopaths


18

and sexual -- psychopaths and sociopaths with actual


19

diagnosis -- and Ted Bundy is the best example of that. 


20

These are really serious individuals not 75 percent of the


21

population. 


22

QUESTION:

What is it -- what is it about them


23

that we can isolate that shows that they are really


24

serious beyond the mere repetition of their crime? 


25

In other words, let me put the question this

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

way.

2

which, as you put it, there is no third element, why


3

aren't you free to go after, let's say, every second


4

offender of a sexual crime at the time of release and say,


5

this person is dangerous within -- sufficiently dangerous


6

within the meaning of the statute to -- to commit here?


7

Under -- under the rule you want us to adopt in


Now, you're not claiming you can do that, but I


8

want to know what it is that you have to prove that stands


9

in the way of your being able to do that. 


10

MS. STOVALL:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. STOVALL:

13

And -- and --


QUESTION:

15

MS. STOVALL:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. STOVALL:

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. STOVALL:

21

And that's a psychiatrically


approved condition that --


14

20

We have to show a mental illness.


No, but --

-- you can get an expert --


-- anything in the DSM.

Right. 


Then you're --

I'm sorry.

Not anything in the


DSM. 

QUESTION:

Then you're back to Justice


22

Ginsburg's question, which -- which is very much like


23

Justice O'Connor's.

24

one criterion in the DSM, you're going to pick up, in


25

Justice O'Connor's reference to the experts, 75 percent


If all you've got to do is satisfy


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

probably of your prison population and -- and based on the


2

-- the categorization Justice Ginsburg described, it would


3

seem to me you would pickup a substantial part of the


4

population outside of prison. 


5

Now, I know you don't want to do that, but on


6

your theory that there is -- there is no third element


7

beyond this categorization, what stands in the way of your


8

doing that? 


9

MS. STOVALL:

The actual diagnosis that those


10

folks actually have those diagnosis and are sexually


11

violent.

12

What I would --


13

Being sexually violent absolutely limits that. 


QUESTION:

All right.

Are you saying then that


14

in the example Justice Ginsburg gave you -- what was it --


15

four out of seven in the list? 


16

MS. STOVALL:

17

QUESTION:

Three of seven. 


That -- that as -- as long as -- as


18

the -- the expert witness says, yes, this person is


19

subject to four out of those seven personality traits,


20

that that person, if a sexual offender, could be locked up


21

under the statute? 


22
23

MS. STOVALL:

They could be committed for


treatment under this -- this statute, yes, Your Honor.

Wow. 


24

QUESTION:

25

MS. STOVALL:

And Mr. Crane -- what -- what I

17

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would want you to know, though, is that it is not a --


2

just because these individuals have committed crimes


3

doesn't mean they have an antisocial personality disorder.

done that behavior.

If I -- although it is not in the record, what I

MS. STOVALL:

That's what I think all of us, or

And it may be


The DSM-IV absolutely is the


standard in the psychiatric profession, but it is not the


10

Bible and is not the only thing psychiatrists use.

11

very much can supplement that with their own judgment, and


12

in fact, that's part of the prefatory language in the DSM.


13

QUESTION:

May I ask you this question?

They


And I'm


14

concerned about whether the instructions were adequate and


15

whether you think the instructions were adequate.

16

of the reasons I have the question is they do not seem, on


17

their face, to require any finding of volitional


18

impairment.

19

volitional impairment in three different ways, one that


20

has to be total inability to comply, some inability to


21

comply, or that it's totally irrelevant to the issue. 


22

Which of those three positions is yours? 


23
24
25

And one


And it seems to me we might look at


MS. STOVALL:

The last, that it's irrelevant to

MS. STOVALL:

That -- that is absolutely the


State's position.

QUESTION:

And I think it's also unnecessary to

show any other kind of impairment in addition to the two

elements that you're describing.

MS. STOVALL:

In order to get a -- in terms of

you have to have an impairment.

with anything under DSM without having an impairment.

12

it's part and parcel.

QUESTION:

You can't be diagnosed

you conceded that you have to show difficulty in

MS. STOVALL:

And I misspoke, Your Honor.

The


6

-- within the definition of the mental abnormality itself,


7

we don't have to show lack of control, but the statutory

language then leads us into that you have this mental

abnormality or disorder that makes you likely or that

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

13

I think the major disagreement between the State

how dangerous is an individual, but why are they

MR. DONHAM:

Your Honor, if -- if I have to


fault the opinion in the -- of the Kansas Supreme Court is


10

-- it is that it expanded its decision that was directly


11

for Mr. Crane under the specific subsection of the Kansas


12

Sexual Predator Act that dealt with individuals who had


13

been found criminally responsible.

14

and its terminology to give effect to all commitments.


15

And it expanded that


The -- the Sexual Predator Act is and should be


16

available for individuals such as your hypothetical,


17

individuals who, because of some psychosis or


18

hallucinations, have in effect lost their ability to


19

control their behavior as well, although perhaps through


20

some better recognized form.

21

specific subsections of the Kansas Sexual Predator Act


22

that would pull those people in for a commitment

proceeding even though they don't go forward -- forward


24

with a trial or if they've been found not guilty by reason


25

of insanity.

Mr. Crane, however, was in that unique section


2

of people who have -- who have been found legally


3

responsible, who are competent to stand trial, who are


4

imprisoned, and upon release this -- this new group of


5

individuals that are now subject to involuntary commitment


6

for some mental disorder this Court found that the

appropriate level of -- of mental illness, if you will,

for Mr. Hendricks was his professed inability to control

his behavior, and that --

You say we -- we found that.

I


11

realize that the opinion refers to the fact that he was


12

unable to control his behavior.

13

-- that was the holding of the case? 


14

MR. DONHAM:

Are you saying that was


Your Honor, as -- as I read --


15

Hendricks stands for the proposition that the Kansas act


16

is constitutional because, as with Mr. Hendricks, what it


17

determined was that the State was not seeking to


18

involuntarily commit people based on dangerousness alone,


19

which would have been absolutely unconstitutional under


20

Foucha v. Louisiana.

element which separated and distinguished Mr. Hendricks

from the larger class of just garden variety recidivists.

Right?

MR. DONHAM:

The -- I think the exact language

of the Kansas statute, or at least of Mr. Hendricks -- I'm


4

sorry.

5

that he was unable to control his behavior.

6

he himself could be sure he would never offend again was


7

for him to die. 


The opinion of Mr. Hendricks was that he admitted


8
9

QUESTION:

The only way


I just read -- I just read the


portion of the -- of the opinion that I think the most


10

relevant, and what it says is difficult, if not


11

impossible, to control behavior.

12

impossibility to control behavior would be very difficult. 


13

That's -- that's what it said. 


14

To show utter


Now -- now, you equate that difficulty or if not


15

impossibility to control behavior with volitional


16

impairment.

17

think the Kansas Supreme Court did?

18

to say that if there's no volitional impairment, there


19

cannot be this difficulty or impossibility of controlling


20

behavior.

21

Why do you -- why do you equate that, as I

They -- they seemed


But that doesn't seem to me to be true.

MR. DONHAM:

Well, when Mr. Hendricks professed


22

that he could not control his behavior, that's an


23

indication that when confronted with temptation, he was


24

unable to exercise his free will. 


25

QUESTION:

That's right.

In Hendricks it

Alderson Reporting Company

assert that that is the only reason for which one can say

a person is unable to control his behavior?

delusion a reason why a person can't control his behavior?

He doesn't know what he's confronted with.

MR. DONHAM:

But why do you

to say affects the ability of an individual to conform his

behavior to society's requirements.

I'm not standing here


10

today as a psychiatrist or a psychologist.

11

subject at best, and even those who work in it disagree. 


12

It's a murky


The principal distinction that I take from the


13

Hendricks decision is that Mr. Hendricks could not have


14

been constitutionally involuntarily committed absent that


15

additional element that set him apart from others who


16

simply behave out of clear choice because they lack any


17

respect or moral value. 


18

QUESTION:

Well, I would have thought, really,


19

that that is not what we limited it to in Hendricks, that


20

a delusional lack of control would be entirely sufficient


21

constitutionally as -- as it relates to a lack of control,


22

that it could be volitional or delusional, that the Kansas


23

court went too far in requiring only volitional as a


24

constitutional standard.


25

MR. DONHAM:

Your Honor, I would agree with

39

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

that.

QUESTION:

Yes, so if you --

You think the court erred.

MR. DONHAM:

I -- I agree with that and I hope I


5

haven't misled the Court.

of Mr. --

QUESTION:

8

Court went too far.


9

I -- I've been acting on behalf


So, you agree that the Kansas Supreme


MR. DONHAM:

I agree that they perhaps imposed


10

too strict a limit on these additional elements that have


11

to be found in order to involuntarily commit. 


12

QUESTION:

But that there has to be some


13

additional elements. 


14

MR. DONHAM:

15

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

And the most appropriate one at hand


16

in this case was volitional.

17

additional elements that might have been argued in your


18

case?

19

might -- we might encounter in cases somewhat like this?


20

Were there any other


And if not, what are the additional elements that


MR. DONHAM:

Your Honor, to the first part of


21

your question, the only available argument that we could


22

have made, the only conceivable jury instruction that


23

would have been consistent with the contradictory evidence


24

at trial and this Court's opinion in Hendricks was a -- a


25

demand for a jury instruction, requiring the jury to find

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that it was his mental abnormality or his personality


2

disorder that made him be likely to re-offend because it


3

interfered with his ability to control his behavior.


4

QUESTION:

So, what are the words that you want


5

there?

That is, imagine I'm talking about the set of


6

people who are very dangerous.

7

the set of people who are very dangerous because of a


8

mental problem.

9

one subset that has a cognitive disorder well beyond the


Imagine I'm talking about


In defining mental problem, we could have


10

normal person, including the normal prisoner.

11

have a set of people who have an emotional disorder well


12

beyond what the ordinary prisoner recidivist has, and we


13

could be talking about what the Kansas Supreme Court


14

thought it was talking about in this case, the set of


15

people who arguably have a volitional disorder.

16

respect to that, it sounded to me, if that's the subject


17

of this case, that the Kansas court used the word cannot


18

control, whereas our Court used the word difficult, if not


19

impossible, to control.

20

there is some difference between those two, and I would


21

think there is. 


22

We could


In


The only argument here being if


But how should we put that in your opinion? 


23

Would it satisfy you if we said this case is about


24

volitional disorders, and there the Constitution permits


25

us to take a dangerous person and commit him civilly if

1

his ability to control his behavior is significantly, a


2

lot, quite a lot less than the ordinary person, including


3

the ordinary prisoner sentenced in a -- in a penitentiary? 


4

How do you want -- in other words, I'm looking for the


5

proper standard.

6

not impossible, maybe that's all right.

7

confusion.

8
9

Cannot sounds too tough.

Difficult, if


But that's caused


So, what's your standard?

MR. DONHAM:

Your Honor, I know the State has


touted the -- the descriptive adjective adequate control. 


10

I'm not sure if I know how to answer that.

11

that if you perform the criminal act, your control was not


12

adequate.

13

personnel are going to have to end up testifying and what


14

eventually will be a question for the jury to decide is


15

whether or not, given the opportunity and the chance for


16

success at committing a criminal act, this individual


17

chose to do that as an exercise of his or her free will or


18

whether or not some overriding mental condition compelled


19

them to act or disabled their capacity to refrain from


20

acting. 


21

I would think


And so, it would seem that what the medical


QUESTION:

I don't -- I really don't understand


22

where we are now.

You're -- you're objecting, as I


23

understand it now, just to the jury instruction.

24

we didn't take this case to decide whether the jury


25

instruction was right under the statute or not.

I mean,


You don't


42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

You think the statute is fine. 


1

challenge the statute.

2

It's just a bad jury instruction that occurred?


3

MR. DONHAM:

Your Honor, as -- as I read the --


4

the Kansas statute, the legislative body intended that the


5

mental defect caused the individual to be likely to commit


6

future predatory acts of violence.


7
8

QUESTION:

No.

It -- it says exactly that, and


you think that's okay.


9

MR. DONHAM:

10

QUESTION:

11

think it was okay. 


12

MR. DONHAM:

Yes, and this Court --

And the Kansas Supreme Court didn't


I disagree with that.

I -- I think


13

-- and allow me to follow up.

14

reinforced the notion that the Kansas act is


15

constitutional because there did exist, at least with Mr.


16

Hendricks, an additional element that because of that,


17

because of his mental illness, he was likely to offend.


18

This Court in Hendricks


The State -- or the Kansas Supreme Court was


19

presented simply the fact pattern in Mr. Crane's case, and


20

-- and that fact pattern was essentially -- or at least


21

the State's position was we don't have to prove any kind


22

of additional element whatsoever. 


23

QUESTION:

Well, they have to prove the


24

causality.

You're saying they don't have to prove


25

causality.

I mean, the way the statute reads is:
43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

who


1

suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder


2

which makes the person likely to engage in repeat acts of


3

sexual violence.

4

commit future acts of sexual violence, but it also must be


5

shown that the reason he's likely to do it is because that


6

is caused by a mental abnormality or personality disorder. 


7

I mean, it seems to me, the statute says exactly what you


8

think it ought to say, and you're just -- you're now


9

complaining about the jury instruction? 


10

It's not just that he's likely to -- to


MR. DONHAM:

We did object to the jury


11

instruction because we felt it did not adequately address


12

the theme that the State carried to the jury.

13

State presented to the jury, through all four of its


14

expert witnesses, is that Mr. Crane satisfied the


15

definition of a sexually violent predator because of his


16

prior repetitive history of criminal offenses.

17

expert, Dr. Mabugat, even testified on the stand that if


18

-- that in satisfying this definition, if the jurors only


19

take his current mental status, coupled with his instant


20

offense for the aggravated sexual battery, he's not a


21

sexually violent predator. 


22

Dr. Mabugat went on to testify --

QUESTION:

What the

Well, just -- just a minute, Mr.


24

Donham.

The question presented by the State is -- in its

Is it not correct that the Kansas

Supreme Court held that the jury was not properly

instructed? 


18

MR. DONHAM:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct. 

It was not properly instructed not


20

because it was not instructed in accordance with the


21

Kansas statute, but because if it had been instructed in


22

accordance with the Kansas statute, that would have been


23

unconstitutional.

24

And you're saying the Kansas statute is not


25

unconstitutional.

Wasn't that the basis of the holding? 


I mean, the whole basis for the Kansas

followed the statute, was unconstitutional was, of course,

that the statute was unconstitutional.

that the statute is okay.

okay now? 


7

MR. DONHAM:

Didn't you say the statute is


What I said, Your Honor, is that


8

the statute requires that an individual susceptible to

hold that a person must be completely unable to control

constitutional standard is under the Due Process Clause.

That's how I read the Kansas opinion, that it thought that


24

there had to be a total, complete lack of control, not


25

just substantial, not just adequate lack, a complete lack

are pretty slippery, and of course, they're all taken in

QUESTION:

Well, what -- did the Kansas Supreme

Court quote the very words from Hendricks that Justice


24

Scalia referred to before to make this finding by linking


25

future dangerousness to a mental abnormality, a

48
Alderson Reporting Company

1

personality disorder, that makes it difficult, if not


2

impossible, to control such behavior?

3

Kansas Supreme Court repeated.

4

conceded that it went beyond that. 


5

MR. DONHAM:

No.

That's what the


You seemed to have


I think my concession to the


6

-- to the fact that the Kansas Supreme Court may have


7

expanded its decision for Mr. Crane too far and -- and by


8

doing that, it in essence, if you will, limited the


9

application of the act.

By taking the particular fact


10

pattern of Mr. Crane for which the only available and the


11

only reasonable qualifying mental defect would have been


12

the inability to control behavior and saying that it's now


13

required for all persons, what the Kansas Supreme Court


14

did was effectively cut off, I think unfairly, the ability


15

of the State to incapacitate people who have other type of


16

significant mental disorders such as Justice Scalia has


17

pointed out, the hallucinations, the psychoses.

18

a different breed of mental illnesses with different


19

effects.

QUESTION:

Those are


Would -- would your objections and


21

the -- and perhaps the Kansas court's objections have been


22

met if instruction no. 9 at page 156 of the joint appendix

said that mental abnormality means a congenital or


24

acquired condition substantially affecting the emotional


25

or volitional capacity?

MR. DONHAM:

If I were to write the instruction,

it would have read it is a acquired or congenital

condition that affects the emotional or volitional

capacity to the degree that the person is unable to

exercise self-control.
