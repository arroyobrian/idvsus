ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MS. BLATT:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The Federal Circuit's decision in this case

12

forecloses judicial review when the very disability for

13

which a veteran seeks benefits prevents the veteran from

14

filing a timely appeal with the Veterans Court.

15

decision is wrong, and for three reasons the court of

16

appeals erred in holding that the deadline at issue in

17

this case is jurisdictional.

That

First, the statute contains no clear

18
19

indication that the deadline is jurisdictional.

20

the text and structure point away from a jurisdictional

21

reading.

22

Rather,

Second, a deadline that applies to disabled

23

and largely uncounseled veterans seeking their first day

24

in court is not the type of deadline that Congress would

25

be expected to rank as jurisdictional.

1

And, third, a jurisdictional reading would

2

render some of the most disabled of veterans the least

3

likely to obtain benefits and would treat veterans worse

4

off than almost all litigants in our Federal system.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

Ms. Blatt, you do have a

6

substantial hurdle to contend with in this Court's

7

decision in Bowles v. Russell, which seemed to say if

8

you have a time limit and it's statutory, it is

9

mandatory and jurisdictional.
So here, we have a time limit set by

10
11

statute, not by rule, and why doesn't -- why isn't that

12

dispositive?

13

MS. BLATT:

Because neither this Court's

14

decision in Bowles nor any other decision by this Court

15

holds that this type of an appeal from a pro-claimant

16

and non-adversarial proceeding to a court of first

17

review clearly speaks in jurisdictional terms,

18

notwithstanding the lack of a jurisdictional label.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Gee, I thought Bowles was a

20

nice, clear case.

I mean, you can always find some

21

distinction in the next case, and I thought the object

22

of Bowles was to say if it's a -- if it's a limit on

23

appeal, it's jurisdictional.

24

I gather, what the Federal Circuit took it to mean.

25

I would have done that if I was down there, probably.

That would -- and that's,

4
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

MS. BLATT:

I mean, I can understand why

2

maybe the Federal Circuit did it, because of the one

3

statement that the court, I think, took out of context.

4

But this Court's decision in Bowles didn't purport to

5

extend to any statute, no matter what the statute said

6

or what the context it arose in.

7

analogous context of an appeal of agency action to a

8

court of first review is a Social Security context.

And the most closely

9

And even if you don't think that that

10

context is directly on point, then the historical

11

backdrop at most would be inconclusive, and that hardly

12

would rise to the type of -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

But doesn't -- doesn't the

14

Social Security context -- it doesn't speak of an

15

appeal, does it?

It talks of a civil action.

16

MS. BLATT:

That's right.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it -­

I mean, you're right that

18

-- you know, that there is -- there is a parallel in

19

what's going on, but the statute does not call it an

20

appeal.

It calls it bringing a civil action -­

21

MS. BLATT:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23
24
25

Right, and the -- and there's -­
-- to challenge their

decision.
MS. BLATT:

There's nothing inherently

jurisdictional about the word "appeal."
5
Alderson Reporting Company

And,

Official

1

Justice Scalia, if Congress that passed this statute

2

wanted to pick up on the jurisdictional rule under 28

3

U.S.C. 2107, presumably it would have written a statute

4

that looks something like that statute with the safety

5

valves.
Of course, when a -- all litigants, civil

6
7

litigants who are appealing a district court judgment to

8

a court of appeals, they have a jurisdictional deadline,

9

but the district court can extend it for good cause or

10

excusable neglect or when the party lacks notice of an

11

adverse judgment.

12

of Appellate Procedure cure the situation when a

13

litigant timely files his appeal but does so in the

14

wrong forum.

15

More importantly, the Federal Rules

In this statute, Congress knew how to

16

incorporate the jurisdictional rule of Bowles.

17

so in a separate provision of the statute in 7292(a).

18

It said when a litigant wants to go from the Veterans

19

Court and appeal that decision to the Federal Circuit,

20

the litigant has to follow the time and the manner

21

prescribed for appealing district court judgments to

22

court of appeals.

23
24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It did

And that is

jurisdictional, 7292?
MS. BLATT:

Yes.

Yes.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

And interestingly,

Official

1

it also goes on to say if you want to appeal to this

2

Court, you have to apply for certiorari.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So Congress -­

You -- so -­
Counsel -- I'm sorry.

Go on.
I'm -- I'm not sure why

7

Congress would have actually known the difference that

8

we established in Bowles, because when it passed this

9

statute, it was before Bowles, wasn't it?

10

MS. BLATT:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what to read of its

12

knowledge of Bowles, whether it meant jurisdiction or

13

not, is -- is a bit of a fiction, isn't it?

14

MS. BLATT:

No.

I think what's important is

15

that Bowles is relying on a series of decisions that had

16

nothing to do with the word "notice of appeal," of

17

course, because they were dealing with cases involving

18

writs of error and petitions for a writ of certiorari.

19

It was all in the context of court-to-court appeals.

20

Bowles doesn't even mention agency appeal of agency

21

action to a court of first review.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's the rule?

23

Justice Scalia said Bowles seemed to establish a

24

sensible, clear rule, which is if Congress uses the word

25

"notice of appeal," it intends a jurisdictional
7

1

restriction.

2

MS. BLATT:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4
5

Well, what -­
That appears to be the

rule that Justice Scalia articulated.
What would be your rule or test now to

6

determine Congress's purpose?

7

would you point to that establish a different rule?

8
9

MS. BLATT:

What -- what of our cases

The rule of Reed Elsevier, which

was a unanimous decision, which says -- and it was

10

written by the same author of Bowles -- that all the

11

decisions are consistent.

You require a clear statement

12

of jurisdictional intent.

And in Bowles, this Court had

13

read the type of limitation that was at issue in Bowles

14

as to clearly speak in jurisdictional terms,

15

notwithstanding a label.

16
17

Here, you have -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
distinction is.

I'm sorry.

I'm not sure what that

It -­

18

MS. BLATT:

You had a century -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what we went on was

20

the word "notice of appeal" in Bowles, with -- within a

21

historical context.

22

MS. BLATT:

I don't think this Court said

23

the word "notice" -- and notice of appeal is not

24

jurisdictional in the criminal context, and Congress

25

used the word "appeal" throughout this particular
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

statute in a non-jurisdictional meaning in all the

2

proceedings that go in the agency.

3

"appellate" and "review on appeal."

4

called the Board of Veterans' Appeal.

5

appeal.

6

if Congress was just thinking of the word "notice of

7

appeal," it -- I mean, the term has a non-jurisdictional

8

meaning in the criminal context.

It used the term
It's actually
Substantive

None of those words have "jurisdictional."

And

9

But if you just look at this statute, which

10

says -- it's directed just at the litigant's obligation

11

to file his -- his appeal within a certain time line,

12

and there's actually a completely separate statute that

13

speaks to the power of the court, the Veterans Court,

14

7252(a), and that makes no reference to the 120-day

15

deadline.
And I think in terms of the context,

16
17

let's -- this is exactly the type of deadline that

18

Congress would be expected to be subject to equitable

19

tolling.

20

Let me just give you the three reasons -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

When you -- you would have

21

us make a statute-by-statute determination as to what we

22

think Congress intended whenever it uses the term

23

"notice of appeal."

25

this one that use the term "notice of appeal" and with

And perhaps that's not a big

Alderson Reporting Company

1

respect to which it is not settled whether it is

2

jurisdictional.
Do you have any sense of how many others

3
4

there might be?
MS. BLATT:

5

Yes.

I think I found four that

6

used the term "notice of appeal," and it was in

7

connection with the district court, and they weren't

8

even reported cases.

9

situations, like an order from the Department of

10

Agriculture.

11

different.

12

They were very esoteric

I mean, maybe the Government has

What you mostly see is the Hobbs Act

13

context, where you're talking about either an organic

14

statute or 28 U.S.C. 2344, which is just a simple

15

petition for review.

16

"notice of appeal."

17

dictate a whole lot, except for the veterans context,

18

where not only do you have the standard lack of

19

indication that this is not jurisdictional, but you have

20

the unique features in that Congress established this

21

court to open the door to veterans seeking disability

22

benefits, and it would just conflict with that purpose

23

to, at the same time, shut the door when the veteran's

24

disability prevents him from getting to the courthouse.

25

That doesn't even use the word
So this case is not going to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Although that -- although

1

that would happen when he appeals from the -- from the

2

veterans' appeals court, right?
MS. BLATT:

3

Yes, and -- but that points out

4

the irony:

He's in better off shape if he appeals to

5

the court of appeals, because there, there's at least

6

important exceptions.

7

The Government's position assumes that no

8

matter what the circumstances were -- and remember, a

9

lot of these cases, the veteran is actually timely

10

filing his appeal; he mistakenly files in the Veterans

11

Administration rather than the Veterans Court.

12

Government's position assumes that these uncounseled

13

veterans are simply out of time and out of luck with no

14

exception.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the

How much time does 7292

16

give to go from the Veterans Court to the Federal

Circuit?

exact time and procedure that is set forth in the

20

process for appealing a United States district court

21

decision to the United States courts of appeals.

22

The

10

-- this is a blink of an eye in the veterans context.

11

The veteran is given an entire year -- not 120 days, a

12

year -- after an initial decision comes down from a

13

regional office to decide whether to appeal to the

14

Boards of Veterans' Appeals.
And you have to keep in mind that this is

15
16

the type of extra time we're talking about.

17

to 60 days would be an extremely poor and unlikely means

18

for Congress to address the type of situation where

19

equitable tolling might be needed, which is either

20

because the Secretary has held onto the notice of appeal

21

until after the 120 days and then tells the veteran, or

22

the veteran has some devastating mental illness and has

23

difficulty with processing deadlines and dealing with

24

concepts.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. BLATT:

It would seem to me -- I'd

Not only has the Federal Circuit

15

ruled en banc that it does, but this Court's decision in

16

Irwin and in United States v. Young specifically

17

recognized that a classic equitable tolling situation is

18

when there's no prejudice to the other side and the

19

litigant files in the wrong forum.

20

And you have to keep in mind, there's a

21

Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure on point.

That is -- as I understand it, Social

Security review, although it's by the district court, is

3

also on the administrative record.

4

MS. BLATT:

Well, it's purely appellate, and

5

district courts always say when they get these things:

6

This is an appeal of a Social Security decision.

7

But I think the three reasons that I'm

8

trying to get on why this is precisely the type of

9

deadline that Congress would not rank as jurisdictional

10

and would want to be subject to equitable tolling are

11

the -- pretty much the reasons that apply even more so

12

in the veterans context.
And that is, the first, is that this is an

13
14

extremely favored class of litigants.

These are

15

veterans who have fought for their country and who are

16

seeking service-connected disability benefits.
This is also the veterans' first opportunity

MS. BLATT:

It's a

Well, I mean, up until 2006,

they were actually barred from having lawyers.

11

But this is the same thing as the Social

12

Security context, which is what this Court relied on

13

unanimously in Bowen, in holding that it's not

14

jurisdictional, and it's also what this Court relied on

15

in Zipes, is that you wouldn't expect Congress to enact

16

an inflexible, harsh, no exceptions whatsoever

17

jurisdictional deadline when Congress presumably knew

18

that the vast majority of people who would be navigating

this system, coming out of this extremely informal

adversarial system where the Secretary had a duty to

actually assist the veteran and then hitting what is

13

said:

some procedural requirements, but we're not even going

15

to mention the 120-day deadline.

16

great pains to say 2107 will apply when you appeal from

But to think about what the Government's

20

position is, is that, notwithstanding that criminal

jurisdictional deadlines, all the civil litigants in our

system who do face jurisdictional deadlines can get an

extension for good cause, excusable neglect, when they

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So whenever we have time

No, of course not.

Like I just

21

for -- I think I found four that say "notice of appeal."

23

All the types of cases that you see are

24

dealing with a petition for review of agency action,

25

à la the Hobbs Act context.

So what I'm asking you to

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

hold is that when you have a -- this particular statute,

2

which the text and structure certainly say it's not

3

jurisdictional, it is exactly the -- it is not the type

4

of deadline you would expect it, and it would undermine

5

all of the purposes that Congress set up this court,

6

which was to ensure they had their day in court, they

7

get the benefits they are entitled to, and, importantly,

8

to cure the perception that veterans were being -- not

9

being treated the way all other claimants seeking

10

Federal benefits were.
This would completely counter that purpose,

11
12

to say:

13

if you can't get up the courthouse steps, that's too

14

bad.

15

or you've been abused by the VA -- the VA bureaucracy,

16

you're out of luck and out of court.

17

Here's a court; we have built it for you, but

If your very disability prevents you from filing

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Although you're willing

18

to -- to allow that happen when there's an appeal

19

from -- from the first appeal, right?

20

MS. BLATT:

And here's why, Justice Scalia.

21

The veteran has had a day in court.

Once he is out of

22

the Veterans Court, he is like every -- or she is like

23

every other litigant in our Federal system, which -- the

24

deadline applies to the government; the deadline applies

25

to the party -- to any party.

That's 2107, which

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

applies to all civil litigants equally.

They've had

2

their day in court, and if it's in the Hobbs Act

3

context, usually they've had some sort of adversarial,

4

court-like proceeding in the administrative agency.
But no decision -- and, again, keep in mind

5
6

there were three decisions in the Social Security

7

context -- no decision has ever said a pro-claimant,

8

non-adversary appeal to a court of first review is

9

jurisdictional.

10

So Congress was acting against that

backdrop.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MS. BLATT:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that was -­

There's no such decision.

Circuit's position until Bowles, right?

16

MS. BLATT:

Right.

But this was an

And they did go back and

17

forth, so there was a period of 6 years that they held

18

it was jurisdictional, and then a period of 11 years,

19

the last 11 years, where it has been non-jurisdictional,

20

and there has been equitable tolling.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the veteran is so

22

profoundly disabled that the veteran can't file the

23

notice of appeal within 120 days after the notice of the

24

decision, at what point after the 120-day period would

25

the right to file a notice of appeal be cut off?

its longstanding treatment of statutory time limits for

in Bowles:

2

that lawyers had long recognized as being, you know, a

3

drop-dead date.

4

That you are dealing with a time limitation

MR. MILLER:

That -- that is true, but what

5

Bowles emphasized was not just the historical treatment

6

of the particular time limit in section 2107, but the

7

historical treatment of statutory time limits for

8

appeals in general, which is why the Court cited not

9

only 2107 cases but -­

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It didn't mention --

11

Bowles didn't mention anything like an appeal from an

12

agency where the district court is -- is sitting,

13

essentially, as an appellate court.

14

But Bowles really was dealing with

15

court-to-court, because it mentioned 2107 and 2101, and

16

I don't recall that it mentioned any -- anything other

17

than court-to-court situations.

18

MR. MILLER:

You're -- you're correct that

19

Bowles was focused on court-to-court appeals, but, of

20

course, in Stone v. INS, which involved a deadline for

21

petitioning for review of a final decision of the Board

22

of Immigration Appeals, the Court held that that time

23

limit was jurisdictional.

24

principle applies to appeals from agencies -­

25

So I think that the same

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Except that -- that one

28

Alderson Reporting Company

1

is an adversarial proceeding, the immigration

2

proceeding, and the veterans' is supposed to be

3

claimant-friendly.
But I think that the -- the -- just as

4
5

Bowles is -- is a challenge for Ms. Blatt, so for you is

6

the Social Security context, because it seems to me the

7

quality of review is the same; that is, what the

8

district court does in a Social Security disability case

9

is the same thing that the Veterans Court does in a

10

veteran's disability case.
MR. MILLER:

11

It -- it is true that

12

functionally, the review that takes place under section

13

405(g) has a lot of appeal-like features, but what's -­

14

and so in that sense, you know, Bowen was like a hybrid

15

case, because you have something that looks a little bit

16

like an appeal, but it takes place in a district court

17

and in a court of original jurisdiction, and, most

18

importantly, Congress referred to it as a civil action

19

that is commenced by the party who is filing a

20

complaint.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

appellate review, isn't it?

answer is "certainly," how likely do you think it is

that Congress would have intended its statutes, in an

How -- who in Congress would have likely
thought such a thing?
MR. MILLER:

3

Well -- I think in evaluating

4

what Congress thought in 1988, one factor that's

5

significant is that this was taking place -- the

6

Veterans' Judicial Review Act -- against a backdrop of

7

decades of no judicial review whatsoever of veterans' -­

8

of VA administrative decisions.
And so Petitioner's position is that

9
10

essentially, Congress, in one fell swoop, went from no

11

review whatsoever to what would be the most forgiving

12

appeal deadline in the entire United States Code.

significant part of the -- the process.

MR. MILLER:

First, I would say I think the

reversal rate is not necessarily out of line with what

you find in other agency review contexts, but -­

that is we look at the statute, if you are looking at

25

the statute, and notice that there are exceptions

Alderson Reporting Company

And

written into it.

And the fact that there are exceptions

2

written into it lends some support to the notion that

3

we, as a court, should not read other exceptions into it

that weren't mentioned.

5

seemed to emphasize.

Now, that's something the Court

And here, when I looked at this statute, I

6
7

noticed there are no exceptions written into it.

And,

8

therefore, following Bowles rather than rejecting

9

Bowles, it would seem that Bowles would support the

10

reading of this statute to allow courts to read into it,

11

because they don't mention anything themselves.
MR. MILLER:

12

I would say two things about

13

that.

14

including the Hobbs Act, the immigration statute, that

15

have no provision for exceptions.

16

certiorari deadline can be extended by a justice, but

17

there is no provision for a good cause exception.

18

extension provision that was specifically at issue in

section 2107 in Bowles hadn't -- wasn't even enacted

20

until 1991.

21

of any other provision that gives you as much as 120

22

days that you have here.

23

The first is that there are many statutes,

This Court's

The

And even with an extension, I'm not aware

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

Leaving that out for a second, if you -- if you thought

25

there can't be a rule that governs all of the thousands
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of different -- or many different statutes, you should

2

look at the context.
So sometimes you will see that Congress,

3
4

given the context, probably did want to give the court

5

some leeway to make exceptions -- where, for example,

6

it's no fault of the litigant -- and in other instances,

7

they didn't.
Now, you've listed -- and Bowles, I thought,

8
9

left that open.

But -- but if it does leave it open,

10

and I'm looking to those factors, you've mentioned one:

11

That this is a long period of time, 120 days.

12

right about that.

is that this is an appeal deadline, and in Bowles,

was not something that the Court emphasized in its

is that there's a presumption that appeal deadlines are

that, well, this is -- the Social Security, there are

the other by notice of appeal.

Congress, having been so kind to veterans, thought:

should we burden this pro se, or at least lawyer-less,

appeal is just a simple one-line document.

It could be that

I think that may well be what

Congress had in mind.

But, nonetheless, the -- the rule

14

established in this Court's cases is that when a notice

15

of appeal deadlines -- and -- and I think that point

16

just illustrates that this is, in fact, a notice of

different from statutes of limitations.

that the VA, you know, ideally would get those notices,

The problem that the VA encounters is that it receives a

tremendous volume of mail, which is not generally opened

something in the mail that just says, you know, I don't

there will be cases in which the result is not

equitable.

MR. MILLER:

We take the opposite

Well, I think there are two

17

answers to that, and the first is that whatever you

think of the rule in Bowles -- and we obviously believe

that it was correctly decided but understand that not

20

everyone takes that view -­

23

that did, in fact, make clear the special nature of the

24

particular provision at issue in that case.

25

I'm just looking at the parts of it

MR. MILLER:

But the -- the question of
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether a particular time limit is or is not

2

jurisdictional would seem to be a quintessential example

3

of the sort of issue where it is more important that the

4

law be settled than that it be settled any particular

5

way.

6

And the great virtue of the rule in Bowles

7

is that it provides clear guidance that appeal deadlines

8

are going to be presumed to be jurisdictional, and if

9

Congress doesn't want them to be, it can say so.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's really the only

11

thing that counsels your result, because in Reed you

12

took -- the Government took the position that a

13

statutory provision is non-jurisdictional if it does not

speak in jurisdictional terms and doesn't address the

15

power of the court.

words "notice of appeal."

I mean, Mr. Miller tells us 80 percent

I understand, and I'm

just telling you that my understanding from not only

10

just the amici briefs, that they do not have anything to

11

deal with the court, is that the veterans organizations

12

don't have notice.

But it won't be disastrous

if they can ask to be registered.
MS. BLATT:

I agree.

But these are -- the

veterans' service -- like in this case, where he lives

20

in North Carolina, there's only, like, 50 VA regional

offices.

how far away they are if he gets notice.

I'm just -- my understanding is that they either -- they

don't get notice, and even if they have notice, they

have -- feel no obligation, because they're not in a

representative capacity at that point, that they would

process his appeal or advise him.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why give them notice?

I mean, isn't the very giving of -- of notice -­
MS. BLATT:

Right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I -­

-- an indication that they

are expected to do something?
MS. BLATT:

And I understand the Government

13

representing that there's notice, and I'm telling you

14

that is not my understanding; that when he said

15

authorized representative, I don't think that that meant

16

veterans service organization.

17

sounds like we have a different understanding.

I may be wrong.

It

But if I can get back on to what is really

19

before this Court, is that when there's no indication,

20

all we have is the three words "notice of appeal" when

21

we know that those three words are non-jurisdictional in

22

the criminal context, that there's nothing

23

jurisdictional about the word "notice of appeal."

And the question is:

Was Congress thinking

about the type of people who appeal district courts to

4

courts of appeals?

5

separate provisions for that.

6

about the Hobbs Act, which deals with licensing of

7

nuclear power plants and orders by the FCC, and has an

8

express statement in the text that it's jurisdictional?

Yes, they were, but they made
Or were they thinking

I doubt that -- I think it is safe to say

9
10

that Congress was not thinking about any of those

11

contexts.

They were trying to give veterans their day

12

in court.

And this decision would say no matter what

13

the circumstances are, they are deprived.
Now, there was some discussion on the

14
15

120-day deadline.

I think another thing that is very

16

safe to say is that time is not of the essence in the

17

veterans system.

18

twenty days is a blink of an eye.

19

Security are given 60 days and other appellants are

20

given 30.

It never has been.
