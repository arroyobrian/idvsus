ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS

8

ON BEHALF OF PRIVATE PETITIONERS

11

MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
In a society that values personal freedom and

12

autonomy, there is a vital interest in securing the

13

ability of individuals to exclude unwanted intruders from

14

their private activities.

15

consists of speech there is a particularly vital interest

16

in preventing intrusion so that individuals may conduct

17

their private communications freely and securely.

18

that reason, Congress and the legislatures of virtually

19

every state in this country have made it unlawful to gain

20

access to a private communication.

21

QUESTION:

And where the private activity

And for

Well, let me stop you right there and

22

ask you why should the question of whether private

23

information about someone is published turn on how the

24

information was obtained?

25

it is and focus there?

Why don't you just look at what

Why does it become secondarily

1

such an important interest to focus on how it was

2

obtained?

3

MR. COLLINS:

Because I think Justice O'Connor

4

what Congress and the state legislatures and in some

5

respects the common law have recognized that separate and

6

apart from the question about whether there is certain

7

information that is so private that it should or shouldn't

8

be revealed which raises content discrimination problems

9

among other things, there is a vital interest in people

10

having private places in their lives where a stealthy

11

intruder cannot come in whether or not the individual --

12

QUESTION:

Well -- well, it ought to turn on the

13

public significance perhaps of the information and

14

presumably the state can prevent unlawful tapping of wires

15

directly and get at the bad actor, but why should it

16

extend to the subsequent user who didn't do anything

17

wrong?

18

MR. COLLINS:

Because Your Honor, as Congress

19

and some forty states have reasoned, if there is intrusion

20

into an individual's private communications, a tap, a bug,

21

a scanner, whatever, and then what is obtained is

22

broadcast to all the world or under these statutes

23

exploited in any other way, the same interests that are

24

harmed by the initial intrusion are harmed again and all

25

the more severely because in essence, you have invited in

this instance a hundred thousand people to eavesdrop, and

2

as petitioner Bartnicki stated in her deposition, when

3

she, having no idea that anyone had intruded into her

4

communication with Mr. Kane, when she heard on the radio

5

it being broadcast she felt that she had been violated in

6

front of a hundred thousand people and that is true I

7

believe independent of the content.

8

today, hear a radio station broadcasting a conversation

where I convey my grocery list to my wife or vice versa, a

10

feel a violation of my person autonomy. Just as if someone

QUESTION:

But you want to say that if I also

hear that and tell my wife that I'm committing a crime.

That's what this statute says.

But that's not what the statute says.
MR. COLLINS:

Well, the far downstream uses are

not at issue -QUESTION:

Oh, but it seems to me with all

23

respect that they are because the respondents can raise

24

those issues on an overly-broad statute under the

Thornhill doctrine even if this does not apply to them.

MR. COLLINS:

Well they -- I think Your Honor,

2

first of all they can't raise it when they they've brought

3

explicitly an as-applied challenge and at no point in the

4

litigation until this Court have they started raising the

5

other applications that they now posit, and secondly this

6

Court in The Florida Star and all the preceding case

7

emphasize that in the very difficult area and it is

8

difficult of conflicts between privacy-type interests and

9

First Amendment interests the Court should decide only as

10

much as it needs to decide in a particular case.

11

QUESTION:

I suppose it's very difficult, is it

12

not, to enforce the prohibition against wire tapping

13

against the person who actually -- who actually does the

14

tapping.

15

to come to light or publicize the thing.

person does the work is to push it on to somebody else who

will do the disclosure.

MR. COLLINS:

That's what happened in this case.

An anonymous tape was sent to the

And Congress -- that is what

happened in this case and Congress was told in both 1968

2

and '86 that it happens very frequently.

3

QUESTION:

I think --

Well, let's change the facts just a

4

little bit.

Suppose what the conversation revealed was

5

not some conversation about we're going to have to commit

6

some violent acts but let's suppose it revealed that in

7

fact, a murder had been committed because of this very

8

situation.

9

the police and your going to punish the person who passed

And the anonymous tape then is passed on to

10

on that tape when a very serious crime has been committed.

11

Now how is the public interest served by that?

12
13

MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, I believe the same --

I think there are two responses to that.

14

QUESTION:

Oh, I actually had that very

15

situation as a trial court judge in a murder case.

16

a hard time understanding how the public interest was

17

served by punishing the person who passed on the

18

information.

19

MR. COLLINS:

I had

I think there are two responses to

20

the question, Your Honor.

The first is there is in the

21

law, as the Government's reply brief points out a doctrine

22

of necessity which in some narrow circumstances, and it's

23

not precisely clear how far it extends, in essence

24

privileges what would otherwise be a violation of a

25

statute.

If the statute doesn't rule that defense out.

1

So an action to protect life and limb may be an exception.

2
3

The second answer though, is that -- because it

4

is a very hard question, but there are -- when there are

5

content-neutral laws that say that because of the way in

6

which information came to someone, that information is not

7

to be revealed be it these statutes or be it for example a

8

protective orders in the Seattle Times, that generally the

9

fact that what was revealed is a matter of public

10

importance does not automatically say that the interests

11

that are being served by the content-neutral law that says

12

either you should not have this information at all or you

13

should not be able to use it, they don't necessarily give

14

way.

15

received in discovery I believe under Seattle Times the

16

press could again be prevented from making use and

17

publishing the tape.

18

And that's indeed if this exact tape had been

QUESTION:

And the key is that -Well, but in Seattle Times and

19

Rhinehart and in the Aguilar case, we were controlling the

20

people who received the information under a court order.

21

They were within our immediate control.

22

case would be as if somebody surreptitiously took this

23

tape and gave if to a person and then that person gave it

24

to the newspapers.

Quite the contrary.

Here we again have very vital interests,

different interests, but the interests of people knowing

that they will not come home some day and have a hundred

thousand people hearing a phone call that they made. And I

20

submit that what unites those cases and in essense solves

21

the problem here is the fact that we're dealing with a

22

totally content-neutral statute and one which as applied

23

does not unduly interfere with the ability of the press --

25

QUESTION:

But merely because it's content-

neutral does not mean you can't regulate it.

This isn't

seditious.

2

that I know of which allows you to regulate it. It's

3

intercepted which is now going to be a new category under

4

your rule and there is no precedent for that.

5

It isn't obscene.

MR. COLLINS:

And there is no category

Your Honor, I don't know of any

6

case in which this Court has struck down a statute which

7

is content-neutral in the full sense that this one is

8

except in some rare circumstances where the Court in

9

essence has determined that too much speech is going to be

10

supressed.

In other words, we are not saying, we don't

11

have to say, that some of this is a category of speech of

12

no First Amendment significance whatsoever.

13

saying is that there are important governmental interests

14

harmed not only by the interception but by the disclosure.

What we are

15
16

If those are then taken into account through a

17

content-neutral statutory regime, we believe and we have

18

argued that that in essence exhausts the First Amendment

19

concerns both as to level of scrutiny and as to satisfying

20

scrutiny as long as we are not in one of the rare

21

situations such as City of Ladue, for example, where the

22

Court would say granted it's content-neutral, but you're

23

just restricting too much speech and we think in this case

the question would be, the concern about whether this

MR. COLLINS:

Does that alter the

We submit that it does not for two

reasons.

interests and secondly -- and I do think this is critical,

10

we then have to ask ourselves is this one of the very rare

11

cases in this Court's jurisprudence where one would say

12

that even though a statute is totally neutral, doesn't

13

lend itself to Government thought control, to supression

14

of ideas in any way, it's not reshaping public debate,

15

totally neutral, does it in some way restrict too much

prevent the press from doing what it needs to do?

believe this is not such a narrow -- one of those rare

situations because as the Court says Branzburg --

Branzburg, for example, the Court says that we know the

vital us to be able to then use the information.

QUESTION:

And even

Well, the difference is in one case

15

they're acting unlawfully and in the other case they have

16

information that they just came across because someone

17

else acted unlawfully and that'd be a big difference?

18

MR. COLLINS:

I think in the final analysis, no,

19

Your Honor, because as I understand Florida Star and this

20

Court's jurisprudence, the question here is whether there

21

are sufficient Government interests to justify a content-

22

neutral application of these laws in this manner.

not a question of is the press a bad actor or not to be

punished.

2

briefed the way that the reason to factor can be construed

under this statute, but I don't think that the proper

analysis of the issues here can ultimately turn simply on

did the press violate a law when they received the

information or not, otherwise of course Congress could

take a jab with the pen and say, oh, and also it's illegal

understand your First Amendment boundaries theory

correctly, that Pentagon Papers which was a prior

anybody else who published the materials could after the

publication be held responsible in money damages.

MR. COLLINS:

Possibly, Your Honor, but Pentagon

MR. WAXMAN:

So you don't want anymore.

I would welcome any and all

want to address the Pentagon Papers point and the point

burden on First Amendment rights here, but we submit that

2

the appropriate level of scrutiny is intermediate-level

3

scrutiny because this is a totally content-neutral law of

general applicability that protects fundamental values of

5

privacy and private speech and denies third parties

6

nothing that they otherwise would have had if the act's

7

prohibition on interception itself was fully effective --

8
9

QUESTION:

General, isn't the problem with the

10

easy analogy to the other intermediate-scrutiny cases that

11

here there in effect is a complete suppression of speech,

12

whereas in the paradigmatic intermediate-scrutiny cases,

13

somebody can speak somewhere, sometime.

14

what he thinks about the draft without burning his card,

15

you can speak at some other time or some other place in

16

the time, place, and manner cases. That's not so here.

17

MR. WAXMAN:

O'Brien can tell

Well, I think that is so here, and

I also think that that is not an accurate characterization

of all the intermediate-scrutiny cases.

not true, for example, in Cohen v. Cowles Media or in

And that's why --

that's why we think that unlike Cohen v. Cowles Media

where the Court applied no heightened First Amendment

scrutiny and the dissenters objected on that ground, we

think that heightened scrutiny is appropriate here,

because there is a restraint on speech.

emphasize this would be a much easier case.

19

true that when you do the balancing, whether you call it

20

intermediate scrutiny or you figure out some other level

21

to put it on, you're -- what you've got to balance is that

22

if this law is good, then the disclosure which apparently

23

has no other source of information which is of concern to

24

the public is absolutely forbidden and we've got to accept

25

that as one of the prices that will be paid. Maybe as you

It's still

say not in every case but it will be paid if the statute

is going to be enforced across the board.

That is absolutely true and

My problem is that in order to make

with your characterization of this as tainted speech that

you cannot use it until it becomes publicly known.

market but maybe you'd comment on that.

15

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, I think that that's

wrong; that is the scarcity of cases shows it because if

you look at the cases, for example, that are reprinted in

QUESTION:

If the rationale of the statute is to

dry up the market, it doesn't prohibit too much speech, it

prohibits precisely the amount of speech that is the

product of what the statute is aimed at.

10

MR. LEVINE:

But if you focus on the speech

11

itself, Justice Stevens, and it is truthful and it

12

involves a matter of public concern, that speech has

value.

That's what the Daily Mail principle is all about.

QUESTION:

No, but you're arguing about the

you're talking about the contents of the diary, the

Justice have suggested, and Justice Breyer's concern about

that prohibition is too crude a weapon, effectively a

QUESTION:

Well, what you then presumably have

other ideas as to how the Government might get at this

problem, less drastic, perhaps?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

What are they?

Mr. Chief Justice, we believe

15

that the solution adopted by the Third Circuit, the narrow

16

approach it took is the one that is appropriate under

17

intermediate scrutiny and that is it left in place by and

18

large the redisclosure prohibition but recognized that

19

when the final disclosure is on a question of public

significance, and is by a person completely uninvolved in

21

the illegal interception, then the speech rights outweigh.

22

So when you have only the circumstance where you have

So is it a fact --

The newspaper's not going to publish
