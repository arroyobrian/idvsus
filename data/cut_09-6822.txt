ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. PARRISH:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Having successfully completed drug treatment

12
13

in prison and having come home to succeed as a college

14

student, valued employee, and family man, Jason Pepper

15

presents to this Court two questions:

16

post-sentencing rehabilitation is a permissible basis

17

for a downward variance from the sentencing guidelines

18

at resentencing, and whether the district court judge in

19

Pepper's resentencing was bound by the law of the case

20

doctrine in its 5K departure ruling absent new facts,

21

changes in the controlling law, or to avoid a manifest

22

injustice.

23

Whether

Post-sentencing rehabilitation has

24

traditionally been a relevant factor for judges to

25

consider and is now a permissible ground for a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the law in the case is

judge said, but it was a question of what's a reasonable

sentence has been vacated, so how does the law of the

case survive?

MR. PARRISH:

The law of the case survives

15

reason to avoid a manifest injustice.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought that the

entire premise of Booker was that judges should have

22

are required by the statute to be balanced and to come

23

to what they believe is the appropriate sentence.

MR. PARRISH:

That's absolutely -- that's

why they are apples and oranges.

If you go to the

Booker decision with regard to Mr. Pepper -- and Mr.

9

Pepper's decision is under the remedial remedy that we

10

are asking that you impose in this case -- Mr. Pepper's

11

case is still on direct appeal.

12

As a matter of fact, if the restrictions

placed upon 3742(g)(2), if they remained, Mr. Booker

would not have gotten the advantage of the remedial

So why isn't a new

sentence just that:

A new sentence?

And the judge,

19

whoever the judge is, can do what they're supposed to

20

do, which is to look at all of the factors and weigh

21

them as that judge believes is appropriate, assuming the

22

remand order is not a limited order.

23

MR. PARRISH:

They can look at all of the

24

facts, if there are new facts presented.

25

is, in the law of the case, there were no new facts.

MR. PARRISH:

Well -­

In that issue, the Eighth

5

Circuit rule that prohibited this was not even part of

6

the 3742(g)(2) statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but one -- one of the

18

19

MR. PARRISH:

That seems

Well -- well, Justice Scalia,

under the issue that's presented to the Court, if you

That's the problem with it.

Mr. Booker, under

And there were several other factors that

13
14

were coming into play where people would never get

15

advantage of the Booker ruling.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16
17

Well, what do you do with

3742(g)(2)?
MR. PARRISH:

18

You excise it.

You discussed

19

it in the Booker decision.

And in the Booker decision,

20

you indicated, Justice Ginsburg, that you excised two of

21

the other -- 3553(b); you also exercise -- excised

22

3742(e), which made the sentences on remand mandatory.
In this case, 3742(g)(2)(A) and (B) were

23
24

left open.

And what happens then, the district court

25

judge has to come back.

Once they look at the decision,
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they are bound within those original facts.

They can't

2

go outside of those facts to decide something different

3

or to permit a variance.

4

The Eighth Circuit didn't use that rule.

5

What we are suggesting is that you excise that rule.

6

You excise 3742(g)(2) and you excise (A) and (B) of that

7

section.
JUSTICE ALITO:

8
9

Would it be consistent with

Booker for Congress to pass a statute that says the

10

following?

When a judge initially imposes a sentence,

11

the judge must specify all of the factors that the judge

12

thinks are relevant to that sentence, whether it's going

13

to be a sentence within the guidelines or a sentence

14

that's outside of the guidelines, and if there is then a

15

remand, the judge may impose a sentence based on the

16

factors that were listed at the initial sentencing but

17

not based on any other factors.
MR. PARRISH:

18

Justice Alito, Congress could

19

do that.

20

this case.

21

PROTECT Act -- in that case, Booker came after that.

22

So, consequently, 3742(g)(2) is problematic.

JUSTICE ALITO:

It says -- well, under

2

3553(c), the sentencing judge is supposed to explain the

3

factors that justify the sentence that's imposed.

4

that would -- that means explain a sentence outside of

the guidelines; also explain why the judge chooses a

6

particular sentence within the guidelines range.

of the things that require us to look at a person as an

that's what your cases -- 3553, 3661 -- that's what they

8

sentencing factors in 3553(a), including the need for

9

deterrents and the need to protect the safety of the

10

community.
Second, the guidelines themselves authorize

11
12

consideration of presentencing rehabilitation to a

13

limited extent, because it's permissible under the

14

guidelines to consider presentencing rehabilitation in

15

selecting a sentence with inside the guideline range.
What the guidelines do prohibit, and there

16
17

is a provision in the guidelines that does prohibit,

18

the -- a departure from the guidelines based on

19

post-sentencing rehabilitation.

20

that, but the judgment of the Commission about how much

21

weight that factor can be given after Booker in an

22

advisory guideline regime is advisory rather than

23

mandatory.

Third -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

The guidelines prohibit

Wait.

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Which guideline?

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

What guideline prohibits that?

2

MR. McLEESE:

5K2.19.

3

And, third, contrary to the suggestion of

4

amicus, there is no general principle in our law that at

5

a resentencing, new information may not be considered.

6

To the contrary, the consistent assumption of the law is

7

that at a resentencing, you take the defendant as you

8

find him as of the time of resentencing.

9

from this Court's decisions in Pearce and in Wasman.

That's clear

10

It's clear from the large body of cases from the lower

11

courts cited in Petitioner's brief at pages 42 through

12

44.

13

no general principle that you cannot consider new

14

information.

15

That's the way the guidelines operate.

So there is

Now, it's true, as Justice Alito's question

16

suggested earlier, that that can result in differences

17

of opportunity, where one defendant will have an

18

opportunity for a resentence and new information will be

19

considered as to that defendant; a similarly situated

20

defendant will not get a resentencing.

21

But that opportunity is sometimes referred

22

to as "luck."

First, it can be good luck or bad luck.

23

And to take the example Justice Alito gave of two twins,

24

if you have an example of two defendants who are twins

25

who are each convicted of an offense -- let's say
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

burglary -- and they are given very lenient sentences,

2

and because the judge looks at their record at the time

3

and determines that they are sympathetic.

4

don't have a prior criminal record.

5

They are

One of them's conviction, you know, has no

6

claims of legal error relative to his conviction; he

7

gets no resentencing.

8

By the time of resentencing, it has become clear that

9

that defendant had previously committed several murders,

The other gets a resentencing.

10

and he has, you know, murdered -- has also committed a

11

subsequent murder.

12

There is no question that, at that

13

resentencing, that information would be considered.

14

There is no question there would be a disparity, and it

15

would be true even if, let's say, those earlier murders

16

had been committed by both of the twins together.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, isn't there a

18

difference between evidence that -- evidence of conduct

19

that occurred prior to the initial sentencing but wasn't

20

known at the time of the initial sentencing, and

21

evidence of conduct that occurs between the initial

22

sentencing and the resentencing?

23

MR. McLEESE:

There could be, but, again -­

24

maybe going too far with the example of the two twins,

25

if the two twins, while they were serving -- let's say
22
Alderson Reporting Company

they got lenient sentences but not probation.

2

they were serving in jail together, they murdered a

3

correctional officer.

4

get a resentencing, if one of those twins does not,

5

there will be no opportunity for that to be taken into

6

account.

If one of the defendants does not

With respect to the other who

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Maybe it's all or nothing.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

It is.
Maybe it works both ways,

13

that the defendant doesn't get the credit for good

14

conduct between sentencing and resentencing but also

15

doesn't get punished at resentencing for unproven

16

conduct that occurs between the first sentence and the

17

next -- and the second sentence.
MR. McLEESE:

18

That's a possible rule of law,

19

but my point was that's not the rule of law we've ever

20

had.

21

rule of law that's created by 3742(g)(2), because

22

3742(g)(2) is not a rule about consideration of new

23

evidence.

24

consideration of new evidence, and it permits these

25

kinds of -- if you -- disparities, whether warranted or

That's not the -- and I should say, nor is it the

It's an anti-departure provision.

23
Alderson Reporting Company

It permits

Official - Subject to Final Review

not, because it permits consideration of new evidence in

2

determining the guidelines range, new evidence about

3

loss amounts or -- or whatever.

4

consideration of new evidence as it might relate to

5

upward adjustments or downward adjustments, as it might

6

relate to criminal history.

7

variances or departures.

What it forbids is new

So 3742(g)(2) does not implement some

It permits

general policy with respect to new evidence, nor, should

I say, to the guidelines, because as I said, the

11

guidelines permit consideration of post-sentence

12

rehabilitation in setting a guideline range.

13

reflect a judgment not about the disparities always

14

trumping other considerations, including accuracy in

sentencing, but only how much weight that those

No.

Apologies.

point is simply that 3742(g)(2), if valid, would

this is, I think, a special case.

But think of 3742(g) in general.

It's

13

pretty easy to read that section as applied to instances

14

where a judge, the initial sentencing judge, has decided

on his own volition to apply the guidelines rather than

not to apply them.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the -- the thing that's

worrying me about -- and I don't think -- I agree with

5

you on policy, but what I'm -- what I'm having trouble

6

with is:

7

interpret 3742(g) so it can be constitutional, and then

if in some cases it violates Apprendi, let the court say

9

that in this case it violates Apprendi.

10

Is it better under the law to say yes, we can

But it just isn't clear to me, which is why

11

I left it alone the first time.

It's not clear.

so -- as to when it is, when it isn't constitutional.

13

You got my whole question there?

MR. McLEESE:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17

So -­

I do, and to take it -­
And I'd appreciate as much

answer as you can give me.
MR. McLEESE:

To take an example that's in

18

the briefs, if at an original sentencing a judge

19

determines the guideline range and ends up calculating

20

it to be relatively low -- 57 to 73 months, which

21

probably aren't even exact numbers -- and determines

22

that that's an appropriate sentence, and although the

23

defendant is urging various factors as a basis for

24

downward -- for variance from the guidelines, the judge

25

determines that there is no reason to vary because this
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is a sentence that seems reasonable.
So that, although those reasons might well

2
3

be persuasive in some contexts, they aren't given the

4

range down.

5

to the court of appeals:

6

the guideline range is much higher.

8

determinations, not found by the jury or admitted by the

9

defendant, which increase the guideline range under the

The government takes an appeal and argues
In fact, the judge was wrong;
And so on remand at

10

new advice from the court of appeals to a guideline

11

range of 121 to 151 months.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13
14

And -­
You think that violates

Apprendi?
MR. McLEESE:

Well, if the judge then says:

15

I would like to vary from the guidelines; I am locked in

16

under the guidelines to a 121-month sentence, and I

17

have -- I didn't -- it's true I didn't vary before on

18

these grounds, but that's because the sentence didn't -­

19

didn't warrant -- because of its relative lack of

20

severity, did not warrant a variance, I think that

21

the -- the logic of Apprendi and Booker would foreclose

22

constraining resentencings in that way.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

MR. MCLEESE:

25

I'm -­
And I think that's an

answer -- if I just -­
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. MCLEESE:

Yes.
I think that's an answer to

3

the question that you had asked earlier, which is, I

4

think, if Congress enacted a statute which categorically

5

said that whatever happens at the original sentencing,

6

the judge has to list any reason that the judge is

7

relying on for a downward variance or departure, and

8

then cabins the judge on remand, that in certain

9

contexts that would be inconsistent with this Court's

10

line of cases from Apprendi through Booker.
JUSTICE ALITO:

11

Well, under 3553(c), the

12

court is supposed to explain the reasons for the

13

sentence, even if it's within the guidelines; isn't that

14

right?

15

MR. McLEESE:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so if the court is

17

deciding whether the sentence should be 57 months or

18

63 months, whatever the figures were that you gave, and

19

the court thinks that some factor -- let's say age -- is

20

significant, the court should say:

21

defendant to 57 as opposed to 63 because of the

22

defendant's advanced age or young age or whatever it is.

I'm sentencing the

23

Now, on appeal, the -- the court of appeals

24

says the guidelines sentence was improperly calculated;

25

it should be -- the real range is 120 to 125 months.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Remand.

Now if the court wants to grant a departure or

2

a variance based on age, the court has mentioned age

3

previously as a relevant factor, and it can do that.

4

But if age wasn't -- if age was not relevant to the

5

determination of where within the guidelines this

6

sentence should be set, why is it -- why does the

7

Constitution require that age be a relevant factor, a

8

factor that's open to the judge on resentencing?
MR. McLEESE:

9

Well -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

It's not --

It's just a notice

11

provision.

12

substantively limits what the court can do.
MR. McLEESE:

13

it's not something that

To clarify, a judge is

14

required to state in open court orally the reasons for a

15

sentence inside the guideline range, only if the range

16

is sufficiently large, and the written statement of

17

reasons is not -- the reasons for selecting a sentence

18

within the guideline range are not required to be in the

19

written statements of reasons.

20

reasons relates only to grounds outside the -- the

21

guidelines.

22

would be extremely difficult to expect sentencing judges

23

to list every conditionally or contingently relevant

24

fact, depending on whatever sentence ultimately comes

25

back on remand, that might be relevant to a reason to

The written statement of

And to -- from a practical perspective, it

29
Alderson Reporting Company

1

depart from a range that the judge is not contemplating

2

at the time of the sentencing.
But I should say also that it -- the answer

3
4

to this question, of whether Congress could reenact

5

3742(g)(2) after Booker, and it would be constitutional

6

or not constitutional as applied in certain settings, is

7

not essential to our point, because the appeal

8

provisions that were excised in Booker were not

9

determined by the Court -- they were not excised because

10

the Court determined they would be independently

11

unconstitutional.
The -- the remedial component of the Booker

12
13

opinion was focused on the question of, having found a

14

constitutional violation, what then do we do to remedy

15

it?

16

this is that we will make the guidelines advisory rather

17

than mandatory.

18

And what the Court said was the way we will remedy

JUSTICE BREYER:

The answer to this case is,

19

I don't think, too hard.

You say it's at least

20

questionable enough, 42(g) you could say, at least

questionable enough that it's the same box as the ones

seems to me there's a considerable confusion, perhaps,

only from my point of view, but this word "variance" --

"variance"?

but if it's true the judge -- you can apply the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Counsel, perhaps

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

before your time is up, you'd like to address the first

2

question.

3

MR. McLEESE:

Yes.

With respect to the law

4

of the case issue, as it has been framed by the -­

5

the -- the briefs by Petitioner on the merits in this

6

Court, it is an extremely narrow issue; and that is,

7

taking as a given that the Eighth Circuit had authority

8

to order de novo resentencing and that, in fact, it did

9

order de novo resentencing, was, at that resentencing,

10

the district court -- the resentencing district court

11

judge bound by the earlier judge's discretionary

12

determination that the substantial assistance provided

13

by defendant Pepper justified a 40 percent reduction?

14

And to ask that question is almost to answer it in the

15

sense that the phrase "de novo" means anew or afresh.

16

And the point -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it has

18

nothing -- but what if the appeal had nothing to do with

19

the issue at all?

20

civil context, so you have two totally unrelated issues.

21

If you appeal issue B and that's what the fight is

22

about, and you reverse and send it back, it would at

23

least be unusual for judge to say, oh, and by the way,

24

I'm coming out the other way on issue A.

25

I'm thinking in -- the analogy in the

MR. McLEESE:

And that's true in the civil

setting.

2

different because sentencing is a relatively discrete

proceeding where there are a number of interconnected

determinations, a lot of them discretionary based on the

to each other.

Courts have taken the view that sentencing is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But these are not

interconnected, are they?
MR. McLEESE:

Well, the amount of

10

substantial assistance that is given in a particular

11

case can easily be interconnected to antecedent

12

determinations, including what the guidelines level is,

13

because judges are often -­

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, my point is that

15

the level of assistance is not in any way connected to

16

the post-sentencing conduct.

17

MR. McLEESE:

No, these two issues are not

18

interrelated, but I'm explaining the reason for the

19

doctrine in the -- in the sentencing setting.

20

greater willingness of courts of appeals to order de

21

novo resentencing and say even though the particular

22

issue on appeal doesn't directly open up the other

23

issues that may have been determined at sentencing,

24

judges in the -- courts of appeals in the sentencing

25

context all agree they have authority to order de novo
34
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

resentencing where they think it's appropriate.

2

they tend to think it's more appropriate in the

3

sentencing context than generally, because, as I said -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

No, but why -- why

5

does that matter when you're talking about two totally

6

unrelated issues?

7

MR. McLEESE:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Because also -­
There's no reason to

suppose that the court of appeals thinks there ought to

10

be -- or any issue with respect to the question A when

11

they focus solely on question B.

12

MR. McLEESE:

I agree.

But, again, when the

13

court of appeals orders de novo resentencing, that

14

doesn't open up only substantial assistance.

15

is the judge is going to go through and make, as of the

16

time of the resentencing, determinations on the

17

situation as it exists at that time.

18

and not at all unusual that issues that were not up in

19

the court of appeals will come up on resentencing.

So, you're worried

about the general rule, but you agree that none of those

arguments make any sense in this case.

you aware of any case where the Eighth Circuit has said
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we're sending this back for resentencing but only on the

2

issue that we addressed on appeal?
MR. McLEESE:

3

Yes.

And the Eighth Circuit's

4

opinions make clear that -- although they apply sort of

5

a default presumption that there will be de novo

6

resentencing, they make clear that they have authority

7

to order limited resentencings.

8

in a particular case they think that's more efficient or

9

more appropriate.

And they do that where

They explained in this case, by the way,

10
11

with respect to the suggestion you made earlier,

12

Mr. Chief Justice, that part of the reason they thought

13

de novo resentencing was appropriate here is because

14

they were reassigning the matter to a different judge,

15

and, therefore, I think for some of the reasons that you

16

were suggesting, they felt de novo review was

17

appropriate.

18

But, again, on the narrow law of the case

19

issue that is presented, there is no disagreement among

20

the courts of appeals, and as the name suggests, if

21

there is a de novo resentencing, the matter is de novo.

22

If I could, for just a moment, turn back to

23

the post-sentence rehabilitation issue to make one last

24

point, which is, going one level deeper into the Booker

25

remedy analysis, again, even if there were some -­

excuse me.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2
3

Finish your

sentence.
MR. McLEESE:

4

All I was going to say is that

5

in excising the appeal provisions that were excised in

6

Booker, the Court identified four reasons why those

7

should be excised, and each one of them applies equally

8

or more so with respect to the provision at issue here.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. CIONGOLI

11
12

AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW
MR. CIONGOLI:

13
14

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress enacted 3742(g) for the purpose of

15
16

stopping district courts from evading the mandate of the

17

court of appeals on remanded sentencing cases by relying

18

on grounds that they did not consider at the original

19

sentencing.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And as far as you're

21

concerned, Justice Alito's question about post- -­

22

post-sentencing criminal conduct couldn't be considered

23

by a court, either?

24

MR. CIONGOLI:

I -­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because it wasn't a

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

factor mentioned in the original sentence, so you would

2

apply the rule equally to -­
MR. CIONGOLI:

3
4

I -- I would, Justice

Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

Is there any logic to

6

that?

I mean, I know that when I was a district court

7

judge, routinely post-sentencing criminal conduct would

8

make me wonder whether this person really was worthy of

9

a lower sentence or not, or of whatever largesse I may

10

have given him or her in original sentence.

11

sense about that?

12

MR. CIONGOLI:

What makes

Well, I think one thing that

13

would make sense of it is there's a different mechanism.

14

There's an opportunity for that to be reflected in a -­

15

in a separate criminal prosecution and a -- and a

16

sentencing for that conduct.

17

sentencing guidelines were created and when 3742(g) was

18

passed, all of this was done against the backdrop of a

19

sense that the sentencing guidelines were to focus on

20

avoiding unwarranted disparities, but as the Court

21

observed in Booker, sentencing -- similar -- similar

22

sentences for similar crimes conducted in similar ways.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When -- when the

I -- when this provision

24

was passed, Congress was worried, I thought, about the

25

situations where district court judges' hands -- were on
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appeal told you can't use this ground for departure, and

2

often the court, because they thought the original

3

sentence they gave was fair, would then articulate

4

another ground for departure that they hadn't earlier.

5

But didn't all of that go out of the window with Booker?

6

I mean, the presumption in -- that drove Congress was

7

that the guidelines were mandatory.

8

they weren't, why should we be limiting Congress -- a

9

judge's discretion ab initio or post hoc to giving what

10

Once Booker said

they believe is a reasonable sentence?
MR. CIONGOLI:

11

Justice Sotomayor, I think

12

that the purpose of 3742(g) is to limit the ability of a

13

district court to evade the mandate on remand in

14

sentencing.

15

Booker; I think it's actually even more important after

16

Booker if you're going, for example, to have meaningful

17

opportunities for the government to appeal.

18

district court can impose a sentence that the court of

19

appeals then finds substantively unreasonable, and -­

20

and on remand the district court can then consider

21

grounds that didn't exist at the time of the original

22

sentencing and, in fact, couldn't have been considered

23

by the court of appeals because the evidence didn't

24

exist at the time the court of appeals reviewed it and

25

is, in this case, uniquely in the hands of the defendant

And I think that purpose was valid before

41
Alderson Reporting Company

If a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to create, then you're going to create essentially a

2

procedural merry-go-round where a district court will

3

impose a 24-month sentence, the government will appeal,

4

the court of appeals will think that's substantively

5

unreasonable.

It will be remanded to the district court

6

who will say:

Well, in the interim this person has

7

rehabilitated them self, they've gotten a job and

8

they've gone to school.

9

another 24-month sentence.

10

The government -- imposing
These are not related to the

facts of the case, but this is a different hypothetical.
The government will then appeal again and

11
12

say:

This is ridiculous.

The underlying conduct is

13

extremely severe; 24 months is substantively

14

unreasonable.

15

appeals.

And they'll appeal to the court of

16

The court of appeals will say:

17

it's substantively unreasonable; we're going to remand

18

for resentencing.

19

And the district court will say:

We agree

Well, not

20

only has he gone to school and not only does he have a

21

job, but he's gotten married, and he has been promoted,

22

and he has been named employee of the year.

23

imposing a 24-month sentence again.

25

So I'm

And at some point, the district -- the
government is going to say:

I give up, because I could

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

keep appealing, but what's the point?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

It appears -­

Well, but there are two

3

explanations for your hypothetical.

One is there has

4

been a real change that affects the judge.
The other is where you -- where you began, I

5
6

thought you were going, where the judge is evading the

7

court of appeals.

8

mean, one may happen, and one may not.

Those are two different things.

MR. CIONGOLI:

9

I

That -- that's right,

10

Justice Kennedy, and I think that both purposes are

11

served by 3742(g).

12

Government -- serves a constitutional purpose.

13

both the Petitioner and the Government object to is the

14

way that it's drafted.

15

say, couldn't pass this, but that they couldn't pass it

16

the way that it's passed because it makes essentially

17

illegal references to the mandatory sentencing

guidelines.

statute was drafted before Booker and didn't have the

20

benefit of knowing how Booker was going to come out.

21

3742(g), as both Petitioner and the
What

It's not that Congress, they

That is a product of the fact that this

What the Court, I think, needs to decide is,

22

post-Booker, how it's going to deal with statutes like

23

3742(g) -- and there are others -- which stand for an

24

entirely constitutional and important purpose but which

25

necessarily, because of the time they were drafted, have
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

references to or language that assumes the existence of

2

a mandatory guidelines scheme.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How many of those

4

statutes are left that we -- that the Court hasn't

5

looked at?
MR. CIONGOLI:

6

Well, I can think of at least

7

three problems that would -- that would result from the

8

Court saying that any reference to a mandatory

9

guidelines scheme creates -- creates essentially a

10

facial invalidity if it's incapable of constitutional

11

review and -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. CIONGOLI:

Which are the three?

Well, first of all, 3553(a)

14

makes two references to -- to 3742(g).

15

question as how you would apply those if you strike

16

3742(g).

17

requires a written statement in the context of a

18

departure, starts to -- starts to raise questions.

19

as Justice Scalia pointed out in his dissent in Booker

20

itself, there's a real question as to whether 3742(f)

21

has any reason to exist after Booker.

22

And so there's a

I think that 3553(c), to the extent that it

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

But all those -- what you'd

23

tend to do is take the parts that refer to the other

24

statute and say they don't do anything.

25

ruin the provision it's in?

And does that

The answer, I think,

44
Alderson Reporting Company

normally ws no, it doesn't ruin it at all.

2

sense.
But this one is a tough one.

3

It makes

I grant you

4

that this one is a tough one.

5

is I can think of a constitutional way of applying this,

6

but it's a little far-fetched.

7

makes me think that it's unconstitutional in the

8

far-fetched nature of it, and I don't think it has a

9

spillover.

10

MR. CIONGOLI:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And my problem of course

And the far-fetched one

But, Justice Breyer, I -­
You see, the far-fetched

12

one was the one that was brought out.

13

far-fetched.

14

it is constitutional, where they're going to apply a new

15

guideline and they don't have the evidence -- as much as

16

I dissented in Apprendi, I think that one probably does

17

violate Apprendi.

To -- to say in those circumstances that

MR. CIONGOLI:

JUSTICE BREYER:

20
21

I mean, not

Justice -­
And I think I have to stick

up for that, don't I?
MR. CIONGOLI:

Well, Justice Breyer, if

22

you're referring to the Solicitor General's hypothetical

23

of a case in which they miscalculate the guidelines and

24

they don't announce their reasons otherwise, I actually

25

think that there's a way to avoid the problem in that,
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

depending on whether the case arises before or after

2

this case.

3

will be very clear to district courts that they need to

4

be very careful and thorough in articulating their

5

reasons for reaching the sentence, which, particularly

6

in a post-Booker world, I think is a good thing.

7

there's -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8
9

If it arises after this case, I think it

If

Would that -- I mean -­

we right now are receiving hundreds of petitions saying

10

the court didn't sufficiently articulate its reasons.

11

We're going to change the practice of the district

12

court.

I mean, dramatically.

13

MR. CIONGOLI:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Well -­
You think that's a good

thing to do?
MR. CIONGOLI:

16

I -- I think having a

17

district court articulate its reasons is a good thing.

18

They are supposed to do that under -- under

19

congressional statute now, 3553(c).

20

do it in open court very clearly, and in certain

21

circumstances, they're supposed to do it -- they're

22

supposed to do it in writing.
JUSTICE BREYER:

23

They're supposed to

They can check a box.

24

can check a box and the -- unless they're going to

25

depart.

They

Now, the part that's not necessary -- you could
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

deal with later, but the part that's confusing me is

2

where this word "variance" comes into, because I think

3

the word "departure" would normally -- normally -- cover

4

the matter.

5

appeals, the court of appeals, whether they're inside

6

the guideline or outside the guideline and have

7

departed, reviews the matter for -- you know, inside and

8

have departed or outside, those situations.

9

Booker the standard is to review for reasonableness.

10

And then when it gets to the court of

It says in

But where does this variance business come in?
MR. CIONGOLI:

11

Well, I think in the context

12

of 3742(g), that's one of the -- the linguistic vestiges

13

of the guidelines, which is that, up until Irizarry, the

14

Court itself used the terms "variance" and "departure"

15

interchangeably because a variance didn't exist prior to

16

Booker.
I don't -- the Court obviously spoke to the

17
18

question of whether or not it was going to equate a

19

variance and a departure in the context of rule 32(h) in

20

Irizarry.

21

was essential to the holding in Irizarry, and I think

22

could be limited there.

23

court is trying to avoid invalidating a duly enacted

24

statute, some flexibility in terms of interpreting

25

departure in 3742(g)(2)(B) would be warranted, and you

I don't think actually that that distinction

I think, particularly where the

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would essentially say that to the extent that a court is

2

varying or departing, that they would need to articulate

3

the reasons.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

It's true that -- that in

5

all of the briefing in Booker, 3742(g) was not mentioned

6

by any party.
MR. CIONGOLI:

7
8

That's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

So it wasn't a question

10

of the Court overlooking it.

11

anything one way or the other about it because it wasn't

12

presented as one of the statutes that would have to be

13

overruled.

14

MR. CIONGOLI:

The Court didn't say

Justice Ginsburg, I think

15

that obviously the Court is dealing very clearly with

16

the constitutionality of it now.

17

Congress had very good reasons for enacting it that

18

continue to be valid.

19

application, I think, in the mine run of cases and, in

20

particular, in this case.

21

allegation in this case.

22

And I think that

It's capable of constitutional

There's no Sixth Amendment

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the problem, to be very

23

specific, is I think the following:

24

sentencing, the judge applies the guideline.

25

There was $300,000 stolen from the bank.
48
Alderson Reporting Company

The first
He says:

I look it up

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

over here and I get sentence X.

2

appellate court says:

3

securities as money taken.

4

and apply guideline Y.

5

a very high number -- and thinks:

6

circumstances which make this case unusual, I want to

7

depart downward.

You should have counted the
So it's 1,300,000.

So go

He goes back, looks at Y -- it's
Given certain

Now, I would have thought that the judge's

8
9

On appeal, the

behavior in that second instance would have violated

10

Apprendi, because that judge was either going to

11

sentence even without the departure on the basis of his

12

having taken some securities worth a million dollars

13

which was not a fact that went to the jury.

14

is.

So there it

Or he'd have to throw aside the guideline.
But this statute says you can't throw aside

15
16

the guidelines, and you can't depart for a reason that

17

wasn't previously given.

18

forcing him to sentence on the basis of a fact that was

19

not found by a jury.

20

saying it violates Apprendi.

21

it doesn't.

22

So this statute is -- is

I think that's the argument for

MR. CIONGOLI:

And I -- I don't see why

Justice Breyer, I -- I think

23

that in -- in certain applications of this statute,

24

there will be problems.

25

unavoidable, and I think it's an unavoidable consequence

I -- I think that's

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of having been drafted before Booker.

2

how the Court is going to address that.

3

going to read the statute flexibly?

4

to interpret it in a way that tries to avoid those

5

circumstances, those constitutional problems?

6

it ultimately determine that it's -- it's essentially

7

not capable of a saving construction.

8
9

The question is
Is the Court

Is -- is it going

Or does

I think it is capable of a saving
construction; I think it's capable of a saving

10

construction in a couple of ways that avoid most of the

11

problems that have been articulated by -- by both

12

Petitioner and the Government.

13

The first, which actually Petitioner points

14

out in his reply brief, is in 3742(g) itself.

There's

15

this language about "except that," that appears to limit

16

the -- the ability of the district court to actually

17

follow the mandate of the court of appeals.

18

I don't think that that can be read to limit

19

the mandate of the court of appeals, nor do I think that

20

anyone is suggesting that 3742(g) changes the rule in

21

Harper v. Virginia Department of -- of Taxation, the

22

idea that -- that district courts obviously would have

23

to give the benefit of intervening changes in -- in law

24

in judicial decisions.

25

used as an example -- Booker on remand would likely have

And so Booker, which has been

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been entitled to a -- a resentencing, a resentencing

2

based on factors that the district court judge could

3

have considered at the time of the original sentencing,

4

but now in light of Booker, basically a do-over.

5

for a -- for a small section of cases, I think that

6

would work.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How?

And

Would -- would you

8

explain, as concisely as you can, why you think that

9

(g)(2) would be unconstitutional in -- in some limited

10

category of cases, and how that can be avoided by what

11

you call a flexible interpretation?

12

MR. CIONGOLI:

Justice Scalia, I think I

13

said it would be problematic; I don't think I conceded

14

that it would be unconstitutional.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. CIONGOLI:

All right.
I -- I think that -- I think

17

that there are some -- there are some circumstances

18

where, by a strict read of -- of (g)(2), the court would

19

be required to apply the guidelines, a guidelines range.

20

And the example that -- that the Solicitor General's

21

Office gave might be the best, which is where you have a

22

circumstance where the district court has imposed a

23

sentence within the guidelines range, has not given any

24

other reason for a variance, the sentence is at the

25

bottom of the range, which may or may not indicate that
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they thought that the -- that the sentence should be at

2

the low end; and then on a -- on a calculation, there's

3

a determination that the -- on appeal, there's a

4

determination that the calculation was incorrect; and on

5

remand, the district court says:

6

this new calculation, and I'm giving you a mandatory

7

sentence.

8

range because I didn't give any other reasons.

9

give any other reasons under -- under (2)(A), and,

10

I'm -- I'm bound by

I'm giving you -- I'm bound by the guidelines
I didn't

therefore, I can only give you a guideline sentence.
And in those cases, the guidelines would be

11
12

mandatory.

13

there's a question as to whether a court can -- can

14

impose a mandatory sentence in any case after Booker.

15

And, under Booker, I think there's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but -- I mean, why

16

wouldn't you read that simply to have been overcome by

17

the holding of Booker, that you apply -- that every

18

judge has to apply 3553 factors and decide the ultimate

19

sentence on the basis of those factors?

20

that what Booker said?

21

to -- to (2)(A) and (B) as well?

22

I mean, isn't

And why wouldn't you apply that

MR. CIONGOLI:

I -- I certainly think the

23

Court could take that approach, and -- and, in fact, I

24

think -- I think to the -- I think it should.

25

that the Court should find a way to read or construe
52
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

3742(a) to be constitutional, because it serves an

2

important and independent policy choice that has been

3

identified by Congress.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

But doesn't it conflict

5

with 3553(a)(2), that is, the overriding provision that

6

a sentence should be sufficient but not greater than

7

necessary to deter criminal conduct?

8

looking at this defendant and says -- a criminal -- to

9

deter criminal conduct and protect public against future

And the judge is

10

crimes:

11

citizen, and we don't have to keep him in for a longer

12

time to protect the public against future crimes.

13

I were to apply 3742(g)(2), I would give him a sentence

14

that is unnecessary to protect the public against future

15

crimes.

16

Well, this person has turned out to be a model

MR. CIONGOLI:

So if

Justice Ginsburg, I think

17

you're pointing out that there is some tension which I

18

have admitted.

19

drafted at a time when there was a different set of

20

assumptions, and so there -- there may be applications

21

which create some difficulty.

22

difficulty in terms of how it's applied, but they are

23

not the kinds of difficulties that I think are

24

insurmountable.

25

difficulties that support what I think is -- is a

I think that, again, this statute was

They create more

And they're certainly not the kinds of

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

proposed broad solution by both Petitioner and the

2

Government, that post-Booker, sentencing statutes which

3

-- which impose a mandatory guideline sentence really in

4

any applications are facially unconstitutional.

5

I don't -- I don't read Booker that way.

6

don't think the Court intended it that way.

7

the remedial holding in Booker doesn't indicate that.

8

If it did -- if that is, in fact, what the remedial

9

holding in Booker stands for, I think the -- the

Certainly,

10

implications are more far reaching than the Court -- the

Court intended.
