 Mr. Wessler. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W.H. WESSLER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. WESSLER: 

Thank you. 

 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 
Court: 
 This case involves an accrual provision in 

13

an ERISA plan that starts the clock running on a Federal 

14

denial of benefits claim near the beginning of ERISA's 

15

mandatory internal claims process before the Federal 

16

claim ever exists or could be filed in court. 

17

 This provision directly conflicts with 

18

ERISA's twotiered remedial structure, which is designed 

19

to maximize the number of claims that are resolved 

20

internally without lawyers in courts.  The Respondent's 

21

provision undermines this goal by making it impossible 

22

for anyone to know in advance how much time will be left 

23

on the limitations clock after the internal process is 

24

complete. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How much time was left in

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

3
4

this case? 
 MR. WESSLER: 

There was approximately one 

year, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And you  and if there 

5

were a oneyear limitation running from the final 

6

administrative review, you would be out? 

7

 MR. WESSLER: 

Well, I don't think we would 

8

be out in this case, Your Honor, because the provision 

9

in this case was a three year from final denial.  Going 

10

forward, if, in fact, ERISA plans had a oneyear clock 

11

running from final denial, everyone would know that they 

12

would need to file their claim within one year from time 

13

of final denial. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes, but if there were 

15

such a rule, one year from the final administrative 

16

decision, this claim would become too late. 

17
18

 MR. WESSLER: 
this plan 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

20

 MR. WESSLER: 

21
22

If, in fact, the provision in 

Yes.  Yes. 
 said one year from final 

denial, that's correct, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What accounts for the 

23

delay?  When the  the clock was running and more than 

24

a year went by before this suit was instituted, why was 

25

that  why did that happen?

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. WESSLER: 

Well, I think this gets us, 

2

Your Honor, to one of the core problems with this 

3

provision, which is that it's confusing.  It is unclear. 

4

One of the key questions with these provisions, when 

5

they're coupled with the mandatory exhaustion 

6

requirement, that is  that is actually quite uncertain 

7

when proof of loss is due. 

8
9

 And so below, one  one of the key 
questions, which actually still remains unresolved, is 

10

when the clock actually started ticking.  But I think 

11

there's a  there's a more fundamental problem 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I thought 

13

the court below said that that was irrelevant to the 

14

resolution of this case, that even if they accepted your 

15

date for when the proof of loss started, that you would 

16

still lose. 

17

 MR. WESSLER: 

In this case, Your Honor, 

18

that's true; however, the problem with these proof of 

19

loss dates coupled with this mandatory exhaustion 

20

requirement is that it is unclear from the outset 

21

when  when the clock  how much time after final 

22

denial would be left when you're in the middle of the 

23

process.  And on this question of proof of loss 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm a little confused 

because it would be the same no matter what rule we

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

instituted. 
 MR. WESSLER: 

Well, I  I don't think 

that's right, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Meaning, you would never 

5

know when the administrative  you really never know 

6

when the administration process is final, just like 

7

you're arguing you don't know when the proof of loss 

8

date is final.  But at least the advantage of proof of 

9

loss, you know you got three years from at least the 

10
11

beginning of the process. 
 MR. WESSLER: 

Right, although I  there's 

12

actually quite a bit of disagreement among the lower 

13

courts about how you measure proof of loss, when that 

14

date actually triggers the limitations clock. 

15

 So for instance, in the Seventh Circuit, the 

16

court has held that proof of loss starts the clock 

17

ticking the first time proof of loss is due under the 

18

plan, which is the first set of documents that a 

19

claimant actually provides to her plan supporting her 

20

claim for disability. 

21

 The plan, however, through this internal 

22

process, can come back and ask for more documents, more 

23

evidence supporting the disability.  And if the claimant 

24

then provides those additional documents, that could 

25

conceivably reset the limitations clock under this proof

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

of loss requirement. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That can only help you. 

3

That can only help you.  It gives you more time, but it 

4

doesn't take time away from you. 

5

 MR. WESSLER: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's true, Your Honor. 
You have three 

7

years, no matter what.  From the first date, you have 

8

three years. 

9
10
11
12

 MR. WESSLER: 

Well, in fact 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If you need more time, 

you have a potential out. 
 MR. WESSLER: 

Well, in fact, you don't have 

13

necessarily three years from when proof of loss starts 

14

because courts, as respondents themselves acknowledge, 

15

are necessarily going to have to evaluate these  these 

16

provisions on a casebycase basis.  So it's 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you know, I guess 

18

there are answers to these  to these legal questions, 

19

whether it's the first filing or if supplemental 

20

documents are required, it's the second filing.  There's 

21

an answer, you know?  Some court will provide the 

22

answer. 

23

 The mere fact that  that provisions in a 

24

contract are subject to various interpretations doesn't 

25

make the provision invalid.  It means something.  We

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just don't know right now what it means until  until a 

2

court provides the answer.  But, wow, that's not 

3

different from any contract. 

4

 MR. WESSLER: 

Well, except, Your Honor, that 

5

in ERISA, one of the core goals of this statute is to 

6

provide predictability, certainty, and efficiency in the 

7

administration of benefits. 

8
9

 And so to have courts being placed in the 
center of what should be a straightforward and 

10

streamlined process undermines the way Congress intended 

11

this benefits administration process to proceed.  And if 

12

you  if you place courts exactly in the middle of 

13

this, where they're going to necessarily be policing the 

14

enforceability of a  of a limitations provision before 

15

they ever get to the question of were the benefits 

16

properly denied, you're undermining the nature of what 

17

this private process is supposed to be. 

18

 It was supposed to be intended to allow the 

19

parties to privately resolve their benefit claims 

20

without 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But ERISA itself contains 

22

no statute of limitations, and it's generally assumed 

23

that, therefore, this State statute of limitations would 

24

govern, and if a State has the position that parties can 

25

contract the statute of limitations  I mean, ERISA

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

does have  does have a statute of limitations for 

2

breach of fiduciary claims, right? 

3
4
5
6
7

 MR. WESSLER: 

That's  that's correct, Your 

Honor. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And it has none for this 

kind of claim. 
 MR. WESSLER: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

8

And I think it was reasonable for Congress to expect 

9

that the  that  that for these denial of benefit 

10

claims, we would look to State law to determine the 

11

length of the period. 

12

 But when that period starts running  and 

13

that's  that's what's at stake here, is when the 

14

limitations clock starts running  was not a question 

15

that we would look to State law for; rather, it's a 

16

question of Federal law.  When does the claim actually 

17

become ripe?  When can you file it in court? 

18

 And  and what  what we have here is a 

19

limitations provision that includes an accrual date that 

20

starts the clock running, not just before when you can 

21

file it in court, but before there's ever even been an 

22

injury. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, ERISA doesn't have a 

24

statute of limitations, it doesn't specifically set out 

25

a statute of limitations for this type of claim.  But it

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

does have a savings clause that says it doesn't preempt 

2

State laws that regulate insurance. 

3

 So what would happen in this situation? 

4

Let's say that a State statute says essentially what the 

5

plan at issue says.  It says that a claim for the 

6

incorrect denial of insurance benefits must be brought 

7

within three years after the proof of loss. 

8

 And now let's assume we agree with you, that 

9

under ERISA, any statute of limitations for the denial 

10

of benefits must begin not when the proof of loss must 

11

be filed, but upon the denial of benefits. 

12

 Does it follow, then, that the rule that 

13

you're advocating would mean that ERISA preempted the 

14

State law that regulated insurance in the way that I 

15

just specified? 

16

 MR. WESSLER: 

I  I would think it would, 

17

because it  because it would conflict with ERISA's 

18

remedial structure.  I would stress here that in this 

19

case, we know that these State laws don't apply to 

20

Respondent's provision.  They themselves have made that 

21

clear in their opposition brief. 

22

 Most State laws, however, actually include 

23

language to the effect of that insurers can use these 

24

kinds of proof of loss languages or something similar so 

25

far as it's not any less favorable.

10

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I think your answer to 

2

that question has to be yes; otherwise, the situation 

3

would be a mess. 

4

 MR. WESSLER: 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes.  Yes. 
But I  but in  in what 

6

sense is the law that I hypothesize not a law that 

7

regulates insurance?  So why wouldn't it fall within 

8

ERISA's savings clause? 

9

 MR. WESSLER: 

It might as a first step, Your 

10

Honor, but I think it would be impliedly conflicted 

11

because it conflicts with the Federal structure of 

12

ERISA.  And the key point about these State law 

13

provisions, which is I think where this provision comes 

14

from in Respondent's plan, is that these State law 

15

insurance regimes do not require mandatory exhaustion of 

16

any internal claims process. 

17

 You  your clock starts running at proof of 

18

loss and so long as you wait a 60day waiting period, 

19

you can then file your claim in court regardless of 

20

whether the insurer has actually acted on your claim. 

21

 That is not true here. 

Claimants do not 

22

have the ability to file their claims in court until 

23

they have exhausted this mandatory process. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is there any evidence in 

other circuits that have this same rule that  that the

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

approach the Respondents advocate has caused 

2

difficulties and disruption and unfairness? 

3

 MR. WESSLER: 

Well, I think we have seen 

4

courts struggling with a host of questions about how to 

5

resolve the enforceability of these provisions.  As just 

6

an example, we know that courts are in the  are having 

7

now to be in the business of asking whether the parties' 

8

conduct during this internal process has caused some 

9

waiver or estoppel of the limitations provision. 

10

 That kind of inquiry, an estoppel kind of 

11

inquiry, is a factbased inquiry about whether the 

12

plan's conduct in the internal process was unduly 

13

reasonable 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But in this case, as 

15

Justice Ginsburg indicated at the outset, there was a 

16

period of, I think, just over a year, in which it was 

17

very clear that the administrative process had ended and 

18

nothing happened.  I don't see the unfairness in the 

19

application of the rule in this case. 

20

 MR. WESSLER: 

Yes, Your Honor, but I think 

21

the core problem here isn't so much one of unfairness as 

22

it is certainty and predictability of what employees' 

23

and plans' rights are under an ERISA plan. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but there is also 

certainty and fairness in processing the claim, and when

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

evidence is lost, especially in cases where employees 

2

who were key witnesses have likely departed, that's 

3

another very important consideration. 

4

 MR. WESSLER: 

Absolutely, Your Honor.  But 

5

to be clear, there is nothing about Respondent's 

6

provision that advances any of those goals any more than 

7

running a limitations clock one year from final denial. 

8
9

 As this Court has said, the internal claims 
process itself provides notice to all the parties about 

10

the possibility for claims and, critically, preserves 

11

all of the evidence that 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What happens  what 

13

happens if you brought suit before the exhaustion, while 

14

it was still going on, before it ended, but you said to 

15

the judge, Judge, we're in the middle of exhausting, so 

16

don't  we don't want to hear the case until that's 

17

finished, can you do that or not? 

18
19

 MR. WESSLER: 

I think that is a very open 

question.  I do not know the answer. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 So then if it were held that you could do 

It's an open question. 

22

it, you could file the lawsuit within the three years 

23

and if exhaustion had not taken place, well, just don't 

24

hear the case until the exhaustion does.  That would 

25

solve your problem.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. WESSLER: 

I think it would, but I also 

think 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean, it wouldn't solve 

4

your problem because you waited too long.  But I mean 

5

that would solve the problem of other people in the 

6

future in your situation. 

7

 MR. WESSLER: 

Correct.  It would create a 

8

vehicle for protecting the claimant's rights and 

9

providing certainty 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What is it that stops that? 

11

I mean, on that ground you would say these clauses are 

12

valid.  It's valid to say he has to  you have to bring 

13

a lawsuit within three years.  Nothing wrong with that. 

14

File a protective complaint. 

15

 MR. WESSLER: 

Absolutely, Your Honor.  But 

16

that gets lawyers and courts involved in a process that 

17

should be private.  ERISA's internal benefits process, 

18

it processes millions of claims a year.  If we have 

19

lawyers turning what should be a nonadversarial, 

20

private process into one that is adversarial and that 

21

allows for the possibility of filing protective actions 

22

in which we ask the Federal court to stay a potential 

23

Federal claim that may never exist while we are in this 

24

indeterminant, flexible process, the courts would be 

25

brought directly into a process that should be private.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, if we rule in 

2

your favor  I'm sorry, against you  and just say the 

3

plans can do this, do you see any reason why the 

4

government couldn't pass a regulation saying you've got 

5

to give people at least a year from the end of the 

6

administrative process to file? 

7

 MR. WESSLER: 

I can't speculate on what the 

8

government would do.  I don't actually know if they 

9

would have the authority to do that. 

10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
that question. 

12

 MR. WESSLER: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14
15

I'm going to ask them 

I'm sure you are. 
But are you aware of 

anything that would stop them from doing that? 
 MR. WESSLER: 

I am not.  Their regulations, 

16

what they have now addresses the internal claims 

17

process.  It doesn't address the rights that exist when 

18

you get to Federal court. 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If we rule in your 

20

favor, however, they would be estopped from passing a 

21

regulation requiring something different than what we 

22

say, correct? 

23

 MR. WESSLER: 

I would think that that's 

24

right.  I mean, I think  I think a rule of accrual 

25

that the limitations clock starts running at final

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

denial is exactly the kind of uniform and clean rule 

2

that everyone can rely on ex ante, from the outset, 

3

across the board in every jurisdiction in the country. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Wessler, this just I 

5

think follows up on Justice Kennedy's question, but have 

6

you identified any cases in which this serves to prevent 

7

somebody from bringing a suit? 

8
9

 MR. WESSLER: 

We have not found any cases in 

which a claimant has actually lost the right to file a 

10

suit.  The problem isn't so much in that possibility. 

11

The problem is in what we do see, which is where there 

12

are three or four or two or five months left after final 

13

denial on the clock, and courts are now in the business 

14

of having to evaluate, does that give enough time to the 

15

claimant to do all the things that she needs to do to 

16

file her claim? 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But it seems as though those 

18

courts have been pretty liberal in saying, whenever it 

19

is necessary, no, take a little bit more time.  So, this you know, it 

20

seems just a little bit like a solution in search of a 

21

problem. 

22

 MR. WESSLER: 

I think in fact it's just the 

23

opposite.  Running the clock during the internal process 

24

ex ante, no one knows where they will be at the end. 

25

This process is indeterminate.  We want the parties to

16

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

take all the time they need to work it out. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I didn't understand your 

3

response to Justice Breyer's question, Mr. Wessler.  I 

4

don't see how a Federal court that simply stays its 

5

stays its hand, abides the termination of the 

6

administrative proceeding, is in any way engaging in any 

7

kind of adversary process. 

8
9

 MR. WESSLER: 

With respect, Your Honor, it's 

not the court that is engaging in the adversarial 

10

process.  It's the private internal claims process that 

11

is supposed to be nonadversarial that has now become 

12

adversarial because there is now a lawyer involved who 

13

has advised her client that she must file a protective 

14

action to avoid the possibility that she will lose her 

15

claim.  We don't 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes, many people in the 

17

administrative process aren't represented, but some are, 

18

right? 

19

 MR. WESSLER: 

That's right, but we think 

20

that this provision would incentivize more lawyers 

21

getting involved because if you are uncertain about how 

22

much time you'll have you will be in a position where 

23

you will want advice.  This provision breeds confusion, and 

24

when we are confused we look for help, and the help that 

25

is going to come into this process are lawyers who are

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to take those kinds of strategic action that 

2

Justice Breyer suggested and involve the courts in what 

3

should be a private process. 

4

 That in and of itself drastically undermines 

5

the point of this internal benefit administration and 

6

just amplifies and magnifies the litigation costs 

7

associated with it.

 If I could reserve the rest of my time.

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

14

 MS. ANDERS: 

15

please the Court: 

16

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 The limitations provision in Respondent's 

17

plan deviates from bedrock Federal limitations 

18

principles in a way that undermines ERISA's twotiered 

19

remedial framework.  Congress enacted that remedial 

20

structure, which requires mandatory exhaustion before 

21

judicial review, against the established limitations 

22

principle that the limitations period begins to run only 

23

when the cause of action accrues, in other words, here, 

24

when exhaustion is complete and the plan has rendered 

25

its final decision.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I find it very hard to 

2

answer the question that is presented here without 

3

knowing the answer to the preemption question that I 

4

asked Mr. Wessler.  And I know you refer to it in a 

5

footnote in your brief and you say that this  the type 

6

of State statute to which I referred would likely be 

7

preempted.  And I can understand why you wouldn't want 

8

to go further than that on that question in a case where 

9

that question isn't squarely presented. 

10

 But if it's not presented, then I think we 

11

would be creating an incredible mess that Congress would 

12

not have intended.  So I really don't understand how I 

13

can answer the question here without knowing the answer 

14

to the question there. 

15

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think that's  I think 

16

that's right and I think State laws that require plans 

17

to have this sort of provision would be preempted.  They 

18

may fall within the savings clause, but, as this Court 

19

has said, even statutes that are within the savings 

20

clause are still subject to ordinary contract preemption 

21

principles. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Those are general 

23

statutes, so they would be preempted just in this class 

24

of claims.  So lawyers would have to know that this 

25

statute is still valid for many purposes, but not for

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

ERISA. 
 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, it may be valid for many 

3

State law purposes, but when a plan is regulated by 

4

ERISA, ERISA's remedial framework establishes the limits 

5

of what that plan 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But then you have  you 

7

have lack of uniformity within the State on when these 

8

claims must be brought under an insurance policy. 

9

 MS. ANDERS: 

I don't think there'd be more 

10

 any more lack of uniformity than there is already. 

11

In fact, most of these State laws, they  they actually 

12

require plans to provide substitute language that would 

13

be at least as favorable to the insureds. 

14

 So, for instance, you could have a plan  a 

15

plan could easily remedy the problem we have here by 

16

saying our limitations period runs from 3 years from 

17

proof of loss or 6 months from the plan's final 

18

determination, whichever is  is later.  That would be 

19

an easy way for a plan to both be uniform and avoid the 

20

problem that we have here, which is undermining ERISA's 

21

remedial framework by setting the two 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But it hasn't undermined 

23

the framework.  I mean,the Petitioner had a year.  I mean, 

24

I can understand if  finding that a particular case 

25

is  is not filed too late when indeed there was 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there was no time to do it.  But here they  they had a 

2

year.  Why  why does that undermine the framework?  If 

3

and when they don't have enough time, the court can say 

4

the  this suit is not precluded. 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, in this case we now know 

6

post hoc that  that the Petitioner had about a year. 

7

But the problem with this framework is that it actually 

8

sets the required exhaustion procedure under 1133 and 

9

the required judicial review under 1132 against each 

10

other, because a claimant who is going through 

11

exhaustion is not going to know while she's going 

12

through the exhaustion process how much time she's going 

13

to have remaining. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So what? 
What evidence do you have 

16

that any bad incentives  you know, any bad effects are 

17

actually flowing from this?  There's actually a big 

18

leeway in this statute, because it's 3 years.  The 

19

administrative review process only takes about a year. 

20

Even if this is a  it's a complicated case where 

21

there's some tolling, you know, maybe it gets you up to 

22

another year, you still have a year. 

23

 I mean, what  how would people behave 

24

badly or behave in ways that you think would disrupt the 

25

statutory scheme, if we just let everything stay as it

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

is? 
 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, first, I think there is 

3

evidence that there have been  that there have been 

4

problems created by this kind of scheme.  There's an 

5

example of a case in which exhaustion took 4 years. 

6

This is an iterative process; the Department of Labor's 

7

regulations, of course, mean for mainstream cases to be 

8

resolved in about a year.  But you can always have cases 

9

 you know, these are situations in which you need 

10

medical exams, you need test results, you need written 

11

reports.  Either side 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Now  in practice  in 

13

practice, how often is that the case that the  that 

14

the guidelines set by the Department of Labor are not 

15

are not met? 

16

 MS. ANDERS: 

I don't have precise 

17

statistics, but the regulations are designed to be 

18

flexible, precisely because there will often be cases in 

19

which one or the other side will need an extension.  And 

20

so there are many cases or at least there are some cases 

21

here where  where if the limitations period is 3 

22

years, it takes  it has taken over 2 1/2 years for 

23

exhaustion to occur, so the  the plaintiff is left 

24

with about 5 months to sue.  And then there's a question 

25

about whether that's reasonable or not which leads to

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

collateral litigation.  There are some cases where the 

2

statute of limitations is only 1 or 2 years. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, I could be more 

4

troubled by this case if the proof of loss provision 

5

required a suit to be brought in a year because as I'm 

6

adding up the timeframe, it's about 15 months if no 

7

exceptions remain for the administrative process. 

8

 Could you answer my question on whether you 

9

see any impediment if we rule against you in this case, 

10

to the department saying something like, you've got to 

11

give at least a year, from the finality of the 

12

administrative process?  Could you pass such a 

13

regulation later? 

14

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think the Department of Labor 

15

would have that authority to do that. I mean, we think the 

16

statute is clear right now that, you know, several 

17

provisions  there are several concepts here that I 

18

think are very clear.  One this mandatory exhaustion in 

19

the statute.  Two, Congress enacted the statute against 

20

the traditional limitations rule, which means that the 

21

statute runs from the date of accrual, and deviating 

22

from that would undermine the structure by causing the 

23

limitations provision to work in a way that limitations 

24

provisions never do.  Limitations provisions are 

25

designed to create certainty for both parties, so that

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you know when you have to bring suit. 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Counsel 
But, Ms. Anders, the 

4

question is  there is a division in the courts of 

5

appeals, and the question is:  Could the Department of 

6

Labor, by regulation, resolve the matter one way or the 

7

other? 

8
9

 Does  even if  even if it thinks the 
statute is clear, the courts obviously don't because 

10

most go the other way.  So given that most courts go the 

11

other way, does the Department of Labor have authority 

12

to adopt a  a regulation that would adopt the accrual 

13

rule? 

14

 MS. ANDERS: 

We do think it would have that 

15

authority and it has that authority because it has the 

16

authority to regulate the claims process and the 

17

procedures 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that's  that's the 

19

internal claims.  Do you know any other instance in 

20

which  when a suit can be brought in  in Federal 

21

court will be determined by an agency? 

22

 MS. ANDERS: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, we 
An agency saying you've got 

24

to sue within 1 year, you've got to sue within 6 years. 

25

Offhand, I can't think of any, and  and I think it

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

goes well beyond what  what the Executive is 

2

authorized to prescribe. 

3

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, we do think the agency 

4

would have the authority here because we think that the 

5

statute of limitations  when the statute of 

6

limitations runs from is intertwined with the 

7

effectiveness about  of the claims procedure.  So 

8

because we think that the  that having the limitations 

9

provision run from before exhaustion even starts 

10

undermines the efficacy of the claims procedure, the 

11

Department of Labor would have the authority to protect 

12

the efficacy of the claims procedure 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You know any other 

14

instances where  where a Federal agency has, in 

15

effect, prescribed the running of the statute for the 

16

courts?  Maybe there are some, but I don't know of any. 

17

 MS. ANDERS: 

I can't tell you right now. 

18

I'm not sure that there aren't any such provisions.  But 

19

we do think the department would have the authority 

20

here. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess one question is, if 

22

you think that you do have authority and you think that 

23

the majority rule has been creating problems, why the 

24

Department of Labor hasn't done that? 

25

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, the department's focus 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in 2000, the last time it regulated, it chose to focus 

2

on matters that were directly involved in the claims 

3

process itself.  It hasn't regulated since then, but its 

4

position is that the statute does not permit plans to 

5

deviate from bedrock limitations principles like this 

6

and undermine the remedial scheme.  So its position is 

7

reflected in our brief and we think it could regulate. 

8
9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If we agree with you, would 

a State legislature have the authority to pass a statute 

10

setting out a particular  a specific statute of 

11

limitations for ERISA claims? 

12

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think it  I think it might 

13

have the authority to do that so long as the statute 

14

were framed in a way that didn't undermine the  the 

15

remedial framework here, yes. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What is your position on 

17

Justice Breyer's suggestion that the trigger can be 

18

proof  when you file proof of claim, but if it happens 

19

that beginning of suit at that point would  while 

20

the  while the administrative review process is 

21

underway, why not say you have to follow the time of 

22

filing, but if the administrative process  in your 

23

case, the 4 years  took 4 years  just hold the suit 

24

in abeyance until the administrative process is 

25

complete?

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think that would be kind of a 

2

bizarre scheme that would turn the exhaustion process 

3

and the point of exhaustion on its head, and that 

4

essentially would require a rush to court by claimants 

5

who don't know yet whether the exhaustion process will 

6

be resolved in their favor.  And the point of exhaustion 

7

is  is to avoid unnecessary suits like that. 

8

 So I  I think it has that problem. 

9
10
11

It 

also is not clear that every claimant is going to know 
to  to file a protective suit. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 What about our saying that, and 

12

what about our saying to the courts as a judgemade 

13

doctrine, exhaustion has to conclude in enough time so 

14

that they have time left to file a lawsuit? 

15
16
17
18
19
20
21

 MS. ANDERS: 

I'm sorry.  If you were to rule 

that 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  Because isn't 

isn't exhaustion a judgemade doctrine? 
 MS. ANDERS: 

It is a judge  it is a 

judgemade doctrine, but I think 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It would be an unfair 

22

process that doesn't leave them a reasonable amount of 

23

time to file a lawsuit. 

24
25

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, I think in this case 

exhaustion is  is established by statute, it's

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

required by statute and by the regulations.  And so, you 

2

know, I think  I think in this case the problem is 

3

that the statute of limitations starts running well 

4

before the exhaustion process is complete, and 

5

therefore, damages the efficacy of that process.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE M.A. CARROLL 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MS. CARROLL: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 Subject to State insurance law, ERISA gives 

13

employers broad leeway to choose the terms on which they 

14

agree to provide benefits, and a suit for benefits 

15

due under an ERISA plan can seek only to enforce those 

16

agreedupon terms. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

benefits at all, do they? 

19

 MS. CARROLL: 

20

Congress's purposes 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22
23

They don't have to provide 

Exactly.  But one of 

And if they do, they do it 

on their own terms. 
 MS. CARROLL: 

That's correct, 

24

Justice Scalia.  And that was one of Congress's 

25

overarching purposes in enacting the statute.

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I suppose the problem here 

2

is that we have found nine cases  you know, we can do 

3

computerassisted research, which my clerks are good 

4

at  and  and they found five cases in which the 

5

exhaustion period was actually longer than the 3year 

6

statute of limitations.  And then they found four others 

7

that were  well, there was like 5 days left in one, 

8

and there was 5 months in another.  And in most of 

9

 almost all those cases, the judge got around the 

10

problem by saying the statute begins to run at the time 

11

the exhaustion is finished. 

12

 Now, I can think of other ways of solving 

13

the problem.  One was, you get a reg.  Another way was 

14

that we interpret the exhaustion doctrine to require 

15

leaving at least a year.  But what's your way of solving 

16

the problem?  Are you just going to let those nine 

17

people just  they can't bring their lawsuit, or what? 

18

 MS. CARROLL: 

Well, I think when those 

19

situations arise  and to be clear, we have 40, almost 

20

40 years of experience under ERISA of these provisions 

21

coexisting with the ERISA remedial framework.  And in 

22

that time period, to come up with, I recall, was it five 

23

or nine cases 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The question was, what do 

you want to do with those nine people?  Now, I know

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there are a lot of ERISA cases, but still there were 

2

nine people 

3

 MS. CARROLL: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course. 
 who will have this 

5

problem.  And my question is, what do you suggest we do 

6

about them? 

7

 MS. CARROLL: 

In the highly unusual 

8

circumstances where those situations arise, and we don't 

9

have any reason to believe they are anything but highly 

10

unusual, we think courts are well equipped to apply the 

11

same equitable doctrines that courts have always applied 

12

to statutes of limitations when situations like that 

13

arise.  I think my friend referred to 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

My question was, what 

15

specific doctrine or  I saw three routes.  Now, you 

16

can name some others, and we do about those nine people 

17

precisely, not in some general terms, but we do what 

18

about them? 

19

 MS. CARROLL: 

In the Lamantia case cited in 

20

the reply brief, the doctrine that was applied was 

21

equitable estoppel because in the facts of that case you 

22

couldn't get to a fouryear point without a final 

23

decision without something having gone wrong.  And in 

24

that case there was 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And now, I suppose  so we

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could use equitable estoppel, even though nobody has 

2

said anything, even though nobody held out anything as a 

3

basis for estoppel.  But we could say use equitable 

4

estoppel.  I'll think about that one. 

5

 Is there any other thing we could use? 

6

 MS. CARROLL: 

There are many.  I want to 

7

be clear.  Estoppel applies where the facts support it, 

8

as do equitable tolling, as do the several provisions in 

9

the Department of Labor regulations that already account 

10

precisely for the interaction between the internal 

11

review process and 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why wouldn't equitable 

13

tolling apply if you don't have enough time to prepare 

14

the court suit?  You have just a month, let's say, and 

15

it's not your fault because you pursued the 

16

administrative proceedings vigorously and promptly.  Why 

17

wouldn't it be applicable? 

18

 MS. CARROLL: 

I think it very well might, 

19

Your Honor.  I don't see any reason why that is not a 

20

perfectly adequate solution. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So these seven people, nine 

22

people  how many were there?  Over 40 years, they 

23

probably had a way out? 

24

 MS. CARROLL: 

25

I think that's right.  And I 

think 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you're pushing 

2

this start to the statute of limitations period, and 

3

your answer to the problems is:  Well, don't worry.  If 

4

it ever turns into something that's going to be 

5

enforced, we won't enforce it, or it won't be 

6

enforceable without a judicial determination about 

7

equitable estoppel and all these other things that are 

8

very difficult to apply. 

9

 MS. CARROLL: 

Our position is that this 

10

limitation provision, like any limitation provision, 

11

whether contractual or statutory, is subject to 

12

equitable doctrines that might apply on the facts of a 

13

particular case.  These are not novel doctrines that 

14

courts are unaccustomed to applying and we don't think 

15

that they are particularly difficult. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Carroll, what would you 

17

think if the State here just amended its statutes 

18

tomorrow and said not 3 years but 18 months?  So for 

19

everybody, it's an 18month period.  It doesn't give 

20

people very long after the 12 or 13 months of the 

21

administrative review process is over.  What should a 

22

court do then?  Should a court strike the entire 

23

statute? 

24
25

 MS. CARROLL: 

Strike the  strike the State 

statute?

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  Should the court say, 

that's unreasonable, that goes too far? 
 MS. CARROLL: 

I mean, I  going back to the 

4

preemption analysis that Justice Alito referred to, I 

5

think that provision would clearly fall within the 

6

saving clause, and the thrust of this Court's ERISA 

7

implied conflict preemption cases has been to ask only 

8

whether the State law purports to supplement or displace 

9

the exclusive remedial scheme under ERISA.  And I don't 

10
11

think that provision would. 
 Now, maybe there would be a new analysis we 

12

would have to ask, which is, does this provision provide 

13

a reasonable opportunity for full and fair review, and 

14

does it practically deprive claimants of the opportunity 

15

to obtain judicial review at the end of that period. 

16

And maybe we would have 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm sorry.  You know what? 

18

Take it out of the statute context.  Just say that the 

19

contract said 18 months rather  so  so that's really 

20

what I meant.  What is  what's a court to do with a 

21

contract that says that? 

22

 MS. CARROLL: 

I think  I think we would 

23

apply that same analysis of asking, has there been a 

24

reasonable opportunity for full and fair review, and has 

25

the claimant been deprived of the opportunity to seek

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

judicial review? 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but in 18 months. I mean and 

3

so 18  the administrative review process takes about 

4

12 months in most cases. 

5

 MS. CARROLL: 

Yes. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

7

 MS. CARROLL: 

Is 18 months enough? 
I think that would be a much 

8

harder case because I do think we  I think our  our 

9

experience with ERISA provisions generally does suggest 

10

that exhaustion can take, you know, usually about a 

11

year, maybe a little over a year.  And so that would be 

12

a harder case. 

13

 It's not what the laws of the vast majority 

14

of States do require, though.  And it's not the 

15

provision that's in this policy.  And I think just as 

16

there can be linedrawing in that direction, there could 

17

be linedrawing questions asked of my friend, what if 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well but, what's the rule of 

19

law  what's the rule of law that allows us to get rid of 

20

a contract provision that's set at 14 months or 

21

15 months or 16 months and to leave this one? 

22

 MS. CARROLL: 

Well, I don't want to  if 

23

I  if I  if I suggested that I wanted to completely 

24

concede that, I misspoke because I think it's a hard 

25

question.  I'm not sure what the answer is.  But I think

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the applicable 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I was thinking that I would 

3

like to  like, 14 months would just seem unreasonable 

4

to me. 

5

 MS. CARROLL: 

Okay.  Well, I think that's 

6

I mean, going back to the Riddlesbarger decision and 

7

Wolfe, this Court has long recognized the common law 

8

principle that contracting parties may agree to a 

9

limitations provision, it must be consistent with the 

10

statutory framework, and it must provide a period of 

11

time for suit that's not unreasonably short.  And I 

12

think the Court could apply 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

There, your opponent is 

14

saying, I have a simpler answer.  I mean, instead of 

15

having to worry whether 14 months is too long or 

16

7 months is too short or a year and a half is adequate 

17

time, instead of having to worry about that in difficult 

18

cases, I have a simpler idea.  We will just run the 

19

three years from the time the  the internal exhaustion 

20

is finished.  Then you don't have to worry about it. 

21

You don't have to worry about equitable tolling, and you 

22

don't have to worry about all this other stuff.  That's 

23

their point. 

24
25

 MS. CARROLL: 

Justice Breyer, the question 

before the Court is not what would be the best idea or

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the best, most simple model if we were writing on a 

2

blank slate.  The question is, is this term in an ERISA 

3

plan, in a suit from which the Petitioner's rights flow 

4

from that plan and her cause of action seeks to enforce 

5

the terms of that plan  may that provision be excised 

6

from every plan in which it appears in all cases on a 

7

categorical basis because we can imagine the possibility 

8

of five or nine cases in which its operation had to be 

9

addressed through the application of traditional 

10

equitable doctrines. 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why would  why would 

12

employers with ERISA plans be hurt by the rule that the 

13

Petitioner is advocating going forward?  Why wouldn't 

14

they just be then able to amend the plan, make the 

15

the period for filing suit begin on the  at the end of 

16

the review process, shorten the period, if  so as to 

17

bring it in line with basically what happened before, 

18

when the period began upon the proof of loss, I don't 

19

quite understand why, going forward, that is  is a 

20

disadvantage to  to employers? 

21

 MS. CARROLL: 

I do think that the current 

22

wording of the provision has a lot to recommend it, and 

23

that's why you see it used as the typical model in 

24

insurance.  And here are a couple of the things.  One is 

25

that 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The current model being the 

proof of loss? 
 MS. CARROLL: 

Being proof of loss.  And that 

is 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

6

 MS. CARROLL: 

And why is that preferable? 
That is because, from the 

7

moment the claim is filed, we know at the outset that 

8

the claim  the books can be closed on the claim for 

9

reserving purposes three years from the proof of loss 

10

date.  Whereas, under a limitation period that does not 

11

commence until the conclusion of the administrative 

12

process, we won't know from the outset when the 

13

limitation period will run or not. 

14

 And so this provision provides some 

15

certainty that the other type of provision doesn't.  I'm 

16

not saying 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Isn't it true that in 

18

insurance contracts, generally, where there is this 

19

proof of loss as the trigger, there isn't a mandatory 

20

administrative  most States don't have this mandatory 

21

administrative review. 

22

 MS. CARROLL: 

Justice Ginsburg, that's 

23

actually not correct, and we've provided some examples 

24

at pages 20 to 21 of the red brief that show how these 

25

provisions do commonly work in the traditional insurance

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

context.  And what you commonly see is a limitation 

2

period, often about 12 months, that will run from the 

3

time of the insured loss, let's say the time of the fire 

4

in a fire insurance policy. 

5

 What subsequently must happen within that 

6

12 months is that the claimant must present proof of 

7

loss within the 12 months as the clock is ticking. 

8

Sometimes they must await the insurer's decision. 

9

Sometimes they simply have a waiting period.  And then 

10

they have to file suit.  And that was the  that was 

11

the scheme that this Court discussed at some length in 

12

the Wolfe case. 

13

 And what that model is about is  I mean, I 

14

think we're all very familiar with the kind of Federal 

15

administrative scheme where there are several steps of 

16

administrative review, followed by a judicial review 

17

step, where Congress writes a limitation period that's 

18

essentially a grant of time in which a claimant can 

19

proceed from one step to the next. 

20

 But that's not the only model, and it's not 

21

the model that characterizes the insurance practice. 

22

With that model  the way that often works is there is 

23

a deadline out there in the future, and by that deadline 

24

a claimant must complete the prelitigation steps 

25

necessary and file their claim.  That's the type of

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

model that this court also considered in enforcing the 

2

McMahon case.  And there's nothing in the law that says 

3

one model versus the other is the only way a limitation 

4

period can ever be written. 

5

 And in ERISA, Congress did not step in to 

6

decide what it thought the limitation period ought to be 

7

or how it thought it ought to work.  It instead said, 

8

number one, we want to defer to State insurance 

9

regulators, even though these provisions had long been 

10

on the books already, we want to defer to State 

11

insurance regulators to govern the content of insured 

12

plans.  And number two, we want to defer to employers' 

13

decisions about the terms on which they want to enter 

14

into the voluntary undertaking of providing benefits. 

15

 And it is a voluntary undertaking and 

16

Congress, speaking about concerns about uncertainty and 

17

so on, the primary uncertainty that Congress was worried 

18

about and that would be visited on employers and 

19

insurers if this Court were to  were to rule for 

20

Ms. Heimeshoff, would be that we don't want to be in a 

21

legal regime where every term in an ERISA plan is 

22

potentially unenforceable because someone can imagine a 

23

handful of five or nine cases in which it's unfair. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but there's 

no  there's no employer who is going to have a plan

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

put together and say, well, I'm not going to do this 

2

unless the statute of limitations for claims runs from 

3

the proof of loss.  And if you tell me it's got to run 

4

from the exhaustion of remedies, I'm just not going to 

5

give a benefit plan.  That's an implausible scenario. 

6

 MS. CARROLL: 

I  I think that it's a 

7

broader point, however, in terms of the uncertainty that 

8

this would raise.  To  to say that this provision 

9

should be excised from ERISA plans in all plans where it 

10

appears, for all cases because of speculation about what 

11

might happen in some cases but does not usually happen, 

12

to say that that can be a basis, absent any other anchor 

13

in the statute, for judicially rewriting or ignoring 

14

plan terms, would be a tectonic shift in the law of 

15

ERISA in terms of Congress's goal of making sure that 

16

plans would be enforced as written, particularly in a 

17

cause of action under Section (a)(1)(B), which is a suit 

18

not to defeat the plan terms, but to enforce the plan 

19

terms. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, what would your 

21

argument be if  if this  if ERISA said there is a 

22

minimum 3year statute of limitations?  Would your 

23

argument be identical today or would that be a clearer 

24

demonstration that Congress intended that the background 

25

principle that that starts from, the exhaustion of

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

administrative process, be incorporated? 
 MS. CARROLL: 

Under the  under the 

3

principle this Court recognized in Riddlesbarger and 

4

Wolfe, parties to a contract may agree to a limitation 

5

period that differs from one in the governing scheme. 

6

So, for example 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So do you require an 

8

explicit agreement that the start is going to be 

9

different as well? 

10

 MS. CARROLL: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

An explicit agreement 
That you can shorten or 

12

lengthen a limitations period, but this is not about 

13

shortening or lengthening a limitations period.  This is 

14

about changing a start time for the limitations period. 

15
16
17

 Do you require something explicit  an 
explicit statement as to that as well? 
 MS. CARROLL: 

Your Honor, if I am 

18

understanding the question correctly, I think if you 

19

if you begin from the premise, as I think all parties 

20

do, that  that contracting parties may agree to the 

21

length of the limitation period 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 MS. CARROLL: 

Right. 
A limitation period  a 

24

length of a limitation period can't be defined or 

25

expressed without reference to some starting point.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It's not the norm to say, oh, we're going to have a 

2

3year period.  You would say it's 3 years from some 

3

date.  It's 3 years from proof of loss or 3 years from 

4

notice or 3 years from discovery or 3 years from my 

5

decision 

6
7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So you think Congress 

would only legislate in that way? 

8

 MS. CARROLL: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry? 
You think Congress would 

10

only legislate that way?  Do you have any examples of 

11

that, of Congress saying the limitations period starts 

12

at the end of the administrative process and is for 3 

13

years or 1 year? 

14

 MS. CARROLL: 

Well, typically, Congress 

15

writes limitations periods that run from the time the 

16

"cause of action," accrues, which is why this Court 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MS. CARROLL: 

That's much better. 
 usually has to decide when 

19

the cause of action accrued.  But that's not always the 

20

case.  So in the Dodd case, for instance, the limitation 

21

period in the Federal habeas statute is not drawn to 

22

anything having to do with accrual, but to a  a menu 

23

of a series of particular events. 

24
25

 And the same thing is true under this 
provision where the parties, rather than defining the

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

limitation period by reference to the accrual of a cause 

2

of action, they have defined it by reference to a 

3

particular point in time, which is a model that is 

4

common in  in the insurance practice and has been 

5

widely used in ERISA plans since ERISA's enactment. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you have any position on 

7

whether the executive can prescribe when  when suit 

8

must be brought? 

9

 MS. CARROLL: 

I  here's how the Department 

10

of Labor has threaded that needle, and that is in the 

11

provisions of the regulations that say things like, if 

12

an ERISA plan provides for additional voluntary appeals 

13

beyond the minimum that's necessary, then the plan must 

14

agree to  not to assert any defense based on the 

15

statute of limitations or timeliness.  And so I think 

16

that sort of approach is probably something that they 

17

could do.  I mean, I think that probably avoids the 

18

question that Your Honor was asking earlier. 

19

 I think, you know, as far as the DOL's 

20

regulatory authority more generally, I think there is 

21

also the looming question about whether the Department 

22

has statutory authority to adopt a regulation that would 

23

have the effect of preempting State law. 

24
25

 But leaving those authority questions aside, 
I think the only other question is whether the

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Department could compile a factual record that would 

2

provide a nonarbitrary basis for taking this action. 

3

I  I'm not sure that they could, but it's certainly 

4

within their right to initiate notice and comment 

5

rulemaking to try to do that. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Ms. Carroll, did I 

7

understand you before to be taking the position that 

8

even if Congress enacted a statute of limitations with 

9

an accrual rule, that that might not be effective as 

10

against a plan provision that provides for the trigger 

11

being proof of claim? 

12

 MS. CARROLL: 

I  I think it would be a 

13

question of statutory interpretation there whether the 

14

inclusion of a particular statute of limitations was 

15

meant to limit contracting parties' ability to agree to 

16

a different one.  And I think if you had a situation 

17

where, you know, let's say the Court in this case 

18

upholds the plan's provision and then Congress amends 

19

the statute to say, you know, we really think this 

20

doesn't make sense and we want to have a different rule, 

21

I think there would be a strong argument that that 

22

statute was intended to foreclose, as Congress may do, 

23

the right of  of parties to contract around that rule. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They're not going to do 

this for a lobby of nine people, are they?

44

Alderson Reporting Company

 MS. CARROLL:

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

3

I  I wouldn't expect so. 
But if they do that, the 

question answers itself.  The  the 

4

 (Laughter.) 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The  the question I would 

6

like to know is if you know empirically, roughly, what 

7

are typical statutes of limitations in this area?  The 

8

basic rule is State law unless contract, is that right? 

9
10
11

 MS. CARROLL: 

I  I think that's right, 

yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And how long on average? 

12

Do you have any idea of  of how long people normally 

13

have to bring their action? 

14
15
16
17
18
19
20

 MS. CARROLL: 

Well, the 3 years from proof 

of loss is the standard provision.  So that is typical. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's the standard provision 

in contracts? 
 MS. CARROLL: 

Yes.  In  in certain types 

of insurance contracts, yes. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I mean  in certain 

21

types of insurance contracts.  So ERISA is all over the 

22

place.  I wouldn't even know where to start.  Does the 

23

Department of Labor keep statistics on this or what? 

24
25

 MS. CARROLL: 

I  I have  I  we have 

looked far and wide for empirical information about this

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and the best I can do is to refer Your Honor to page 29 

2

of the amicus brief for the American Council of Life 

3

Insurers, which does collect a little bit of empirical 

4

information about the exceeding rarity with which this 

5

issue ever arises in ERISA cases and the typical length 

6

of time that's required to exhaust. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, it's hard to 

8

see what you mean by the exceeding rarity.  I suspect 

9

there are more than nine cases where people are looking 

10

at the running of the statute of limitations and they're 

11

saying, well, I've got to sue if I don't get this and 

12

when do I have to hire a lawyer.  And the last thing you 

13

want in this process is to get lawyers involved at the 

14

claim procedure.  And they say, well, there's only 10 

15

months left, I'd better hire a lawyer, you know, and 

16

instead of the informal resolution, you've suddenly got 

17

lawyers involved.  Why isn't that a legitimate concern? 

18

 On the other hand, if you wait until the 

19

claim is exhausted, you may  you may not need the 

20

lawyer at all.  But if you don't know when that period 

21

is going to run, you'd better get one early  sooner 

22

rather than later. 

23

 MS. CARROLL: 

Well, of course in this case, 

24

the Petitioner did have counsel from relatively early on 

25

in the process.

46

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, she was very 

prudent. 
 MS. CARROLL: 

So I'm not sure that 

Pardon? 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I mean, she didn't 

6

know when it was going to run, you'd better get somebody 

7

in there right away.  The typical lay person who's got a 

8

claim for $9,000 in disability benefits or whatever, you 

9

know, may not know.  Better get a lawyer to tell her. 

10

 It just seems to me that you keep it as an 

11

informal resolution  inexpensive resolution process if 

12

you tell somebody look, you don't have to worry about 

13

getting a lawyer until we tell you whether we're going 

14

to deny your claims or not. 

15

 MS. CARROLL: 

And, Your Honor, that easy, 

16

inexpensive process is how it works in the vast majority 

17

of cases.  I think something like 80 percent of 

18

disability claims are granted through the internal 

19

review process without there ever being any need to go 

20

to litigation.  And I think the reason 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that's my 

22

point.  I'm not talking about the need to go to 

23

litigation.  I think there are probably more than 9 

24

people who had to hire lawyers before they even had a 

25

decision.

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. CARROLL: 

Oh, I think that's right.  I 

2

mean, this is not  I think our best sense is that 

3

there's something around the order of about a quarter to 

4

a third of cases in which claimants are represented by 

5

counsel.  But I think the question that Your Honor is 

6

is posing, of the claimant who's approaching some point 

7

where they are wondering what to do, that's going to be 

8

a claimant who's looking at a deadline for filing suit 

9

that is probably still a year and a half or two years 

10
11

away in typical cases. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, and it's 

12

probably a claimant that doesn't have all that much 

13

experience with the legal system and doesn't know well how long 

14

does it take, you know, to get a complaint ready and 

15

I don't know.  It just seems to me that the problem of a 

16

statute of limitations that runs before the claim even 

17

accrues requires people to worry about their legal 

18

rights in a way that  the simple rule about when your 

19

benefits are denied, that's when the period starts 

20

running. 

21

 MS. CARROLL: 

Well, I mean, granted all 

22

statutes of limitations do impose some obligation on 

23

wouldbe plaintiffs to take steps to protect themselves. 

24

That  that is true of all limitations periods no 

25

matter how they are drawn.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It's fair to say, in other 

2

words, that it's typical in the insurance industry that 

3

statute of limitations run from proof of loss? 

4

 MS. CARROLL: 

In the group  in the group 

5

benefit plans of the type that are subject to ERISA, 

6

that is very common.  That is the standard term.  Going 

7

back to the older products like fire insurance, life 

8

insurance, and so on, it would often run before proof of 

9

loss, from the actual insured event. 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

From occurrence? 

Occurrence 
 MS. CARROLL: 

Exactly.  Exactly.  And with 

13

 the reason why it's different in a longterm 

14

disability plan is that you have to make sure that the 

15

disability is actually a longterm disability.  And so 

16

that's why you have these elimination periods followed 

17

by a proof of loss deadline because there has to be a 

18

sustained disability in that interim period.  And so you 

19

don't run it from an earlier point because it's not 

20

clear that the insured event has occurred until you've 

21

come to that point. 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, you started to answer 

23

this question before, but I'm not sure I understand the 

24

answer, why this proof of loss model is  is so 

25

attractive in the disability insurance field?  You said

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that it provides a clear date on which you know you can 

2

begin to count.  But so does an accrual rule.  So maybe 

3

you can explain a little bit more. 

4

 MS. CARROLL: 

I  I think what I meant by 

5

that was that under what I take Your Honor to mean by an 

6

accrual rule, meaning a limitation period that runs 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

8

 MS. CARROLL: 

9

Right, right. 
 at the conclusion of the 

administrative process, we don't know at the time that 

10

the claim is initially presented when that's going to 

11

be.  Is it going to be 6 months from now?  A year from 

12

now?  A year and a half from now?  And so it's just simply 

13

for reserving purposes, it helps to have a greater sense 

14

of certainty about the timing of potential claims and 

15

when we can close the books. 

16
17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's  the doctrine of 

exhaustion is a judgecreated doctrine. 

18

 MS. CARROLL: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Correct. 
And therefore you cannot, 

20

in your contract, contract yourself around it.  You 

21

can't get out of it. 

22

 MS. CARROLL: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No.  And 
So what this would require 

24

would be to say that that judgecreated doctrine 

25

requires exhaustion to take place before the accrual of

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the statute of limitations, end of opinion.  For the 

2

reason of certainty, for the reason of uniformity, for 

3

the reason of avoiding, through hiring lawyers, et 

4

cetera, an interference with the voluntary nature, 

5

simple nature, and hopefully prelegal involvement 

6

nature of that exhaustion process, all right?  Da, da, 

7

da.

9

 Now, the reason  what trouble would that 
cause? 

10

 MS. CARROLL: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

12

industry would that cause? 

13

 MS. CARROLL: 

The 
What trouble in the 

The  that trouble  that 

14

would cause trouble for every employer, plan sponsor, 

15

insurer that has an ERISA plan.  And here's why.  Since 

16

ERISA's enactment, this Court has never held that in a 

17

suit to enforce the terms of an ERISA plan those terms 

18

can be thrown out the window because we worry that they 

19

might be unfair in some case that we can speculate 

20

about. 

21

 That would be a very significant shift in 

22

how this Court enforces ERISA plans, and it would 

23

undermine Congress's goal of wanting to assure employers 

24

and plan sponsors that the terms on which they agree to 

25

provide benefits will be respected.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I thought that this 

2

contract required exhaustion of administrative remedies 

3

before you can sue.  Isn't that in the contract?

 MS. CARROLL: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

So it's not a judgecreated 

doctrine. 

7

 MS. CARROLL: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

It is. 

It's 
I mean, we create it in 

other instances where  where there are agency, you

creation, I suppose. 

17

 MS. CARROLL: 

Well, but even when it is the 

18

Court's creation it is not without exceptions, it is not 

19

jurisdictional.  We like exhaustion.  We think  we 

20

think that internal review is a very successful and 

21

workable scheme that resolves the vast majority of cases 

22

with mutual benefits to all sides. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Carroll, please tell me 

24

if I'm wrong.  But even if a contract does not have an 

25

exhaustion requirement, courts have required exhaustion.

 MS. CARROLL: 

That's  that's correct, for 

good reason, although with exceptions. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And courts have required it 

even though the statute doesn't say so. 

5

 MS. CARROLL: 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That's true. 
It's an extratextual 

7

requirement the courts have made up, irrespective of 

8

what the contract provides. 

9

 MS. CARROLL: 

That's true.  But it is not 

10

one that required setting aside or defeating any term of 

11

an ERISA plan.  And that's the key distinction. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

 MS. CARROLL: 

Did I 

And as the party that has come 

14

forward to say that even though I am trying to enforce 

15

this plan, I nevertheless want to jettison the plan 

16

terms, I think the Petitioner bears a burden to say 

17

there is some anchor in the statute or some basis in 

18

evidence or experience to say, not simply to speculate, 

19

that there is a potential clash with the remedial 

20

scheme, but that there is one. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I think what Justice Breyer 

22

was suggesting, that maybe, given that we have this sort 

23

of judgemade rule of exhaustion, that the courts just 

24

did a sort of a half job of it, that they also should have 

25

put the statute of limitations that makes that

53

Alderson Reporting Company

1

exhaustion requirement work, and that ensures that it 

2

doesn't produce unfair, bad outcomes. 

3

 MS. CARROLL: 

I think if there is a  if 

4

there is a question as between a judgemade doctrine and 

5

the terms of a plan as to which should give way, I think 

6

Congress has made clear that it is the terms of the plan 

7

that ought to control, as has this Court made clear. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

The Congress was dealing 

9

you know, Congress passed ERISA before this exhaustion 

10

requirement came into play.  So it's a little bit hard 

11

to read into anything, to read Congress's silence in the 

12

normal way here because Congress didn't think that there 

13

was going to be this exhaustion requirement 

14

 MS. CARROLL: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

16
17

I 
 and the courts put it on 

later. 
 MS. CARROLL: 

I'm not sure about that.  I 

18

think the courts that found an exhaustion requirement 

19

did so in an act of statutory interpretation and found 

20

that to be consistent with Congress's intent in the 

21

statute. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Did I understand 

23

did I understand you earlier to say we have not had a 

24

case where we have overridden plan terms in ERISA plans? 

25

 MS. CARROLL: 

In a  in a suit under

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

section 1132(a)(1)(B) to enforce a plan term, there is 

2

no decision in which this Court has said we can simply 

3

ignore plan terms. Rather what, 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, simply ignore. 

5

I mean, is there any in which we have overridden plan 

6

terms? 

7

 MS. CARROLL: 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

 MS. CARROLL: 

No. 
No. 

No.  There are no  there 

10

have been plenty of cases where people have asked to do 

11

so, and where this Court has had to say  for example 

12

in the  in the Amara case, in the McCutchen case, in 

13

the Kennedy case, where the Court had to consider 

14

situations where maybe we should come up with a 

15

judgemade sort of common law model that seems like a 

16

better rule.  And the Court said, no, we are not going 

17

to do that because this is a situation.  This is a 

18

context where Congress wanted plan terms to control. 

19

 Here the plan terms clearly bar the suit. 

20

There's no allegation that the  the 

21

administrative regime here was 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Look, you agree that we 

23

would overturn the plan term if the plan term was no 

24

exhaustion? 

25

 MS. CARROLL: 

I'm sorry?

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The courts would overturn a 

plan term which plan term said no exhaustion. 
 MS. CARROLL: 

I  well, I doubt very much 

you would ever encounter a plan term like that. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course not because what 

6

we are trying to do  and employers are very 

7

cooperative and we are trying to work out a system with 

8

the exhaustion thing that will not destroy ERISA plans 

9

or something. 

10

 MS. CARROLL: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
It  it's which is the 

12

and that's why I phrased it in terms of an explanation 

13

of the exhaustion requirement. 

14

 MS. CARROLL: 

Yes.  I suppose if you had an 

15

intransigent plan that just said, no, we refuse to 

16

entertain your attempts to appeal, that is a situation 

17

where a court would apply one of the futility exceptions 

18

to exhaustion.  So I  I don't think that would 

19

would present an issue.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W.H. WESSLER,

Thank you.  Just a few  a 

few brief points.

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry, you have 

4 minutes left. 

3

 MR. WESSLER: 

4

 First of all, this Court has in UNUM v. Ward 

Thank you. 

5

refused to enforce a plan term that would have 

6

overridden a State law notice prejudice rule.  But I 

7

think the bigger point here is that provisions that 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

 MR. WESSLER: 

10

What case is that? 
UNUM v. Ward, Your Honor. 

 The bigger point here is that provisions 

11

that tamper with ERISA's enforcement scheme, as this 

12

provision does, are inconsistent with ERISA's remedial 

13

structure.  By Respondent's own argument, this is not an 

14

enforce the contract provision. 

15

 This is a sometimes enforcing the contract 

16

provision, that is itself automatically subject to a 

17

reasonableness override, in which courts can and are 

18

expected to actually decline to enforce the plain 

19

language of the provision in cases in which it finds, 

20

under a host of factspecific questions, the provision 

21

is either unreasonable or the plan is estopped 

22

from enforcing it or has waived it. 

23

 And that, we submit, Your Honor, is the key 

24

defect with this provision because it puts courts right 

25

in the center of policing what should be a private

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

process. 
 If plans are  if Courts are able to look 

3

back and determine whether a plan's conduct in the 

4

internal process was  was unreasonable, was dilatory, 

5

was unreasonably delayed, then all of a sudden the 

6

private benefit resolution process, which this Court has 

7

said, as have all of the lower courts that have looked 

8

at it, is designed to be nonadversarial, flexible, and 

9

private, turns into something that looks like none of 

10

those things. 

11

 It turns into a process in which lawyers get 

12

involved early, in which courts get involved early, and 

13

in which these plan terms are subject to revision or 

14

over  overrides in a host of cases and in which both 

15

plans and claimants have no idea ex ante whether or when 

16

this provision will be enforced. 

17

 A rule running from final denial, which I 

18

should say is the consistent rule across the board in 

19

every Federal statutory regime, stated  going back 

20

from  to the beginning of the law that we have been 

21

able to find, runs the limitations clock from when you 

22

can file the claim in court. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if we agree with you, 

24

would the Federal courts and maybe ultimately this Court 

25

in the end have to specify what the statute of

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

limitations is, the length of time?  So we have a bunch 

2

of cases from different courts, and one circuit says 2 

3

years is  is the  that's the shortest you can have. 

4

Another one says, no, you can have a year.  Another one 

5

says, well, you could have 9 months. 

6
7
8
9
10
11

 How would this ultimately happen? 

Wouldn't 

we be driven to that? 
 MR. WESSLER: 

I  I think not.  I think 

plans have absolute authority to  to themselves 
specify the length of the period.  We see this 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

They specify a lot of 

12

different lengths, and then they're all challenged 

13

different ones are challenged in different courts, and 

14

the courts have to say what's reasonable.  And there's 

15

no State statute of limitations that applies to this 

16

situation.  So it all comes down just to a question of 

17

reasonableness. 

18

 MR. WESSLER: 

I think that  I think two 

19

answers to that, Your Honor.  First, I don't think 

20

that's actually correct.  Most plans that run the length 

21

only do about a one year from  from final denial. 

22

 As Respondents themselves have  have 

23

explained, and we agree, courts across the board find 

24

one year in almost every context to be reasonable.  And 

25

so it would automatically be enforced.

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But the difference also is in the type of 

2

reasonableness inquiry that a court would have to apply 

3

in  in the case that you're suggesting, which is not a 

4

factspecific inquiry based on how long the parties took 

5

to pursue this internal process.  It's simply an 

6

objective question.  Is the amount of time on the 

7

limitations clock enough to allow a plaintiff to file 

8

her claim in court? 

9

 And one month  excuse me. 

One year from 

10

final denial would absolutely be enough time, would 

11

provide all parties under ERISA with the certainty that 

12

they have to  to file their claim. 

13

 Thank you, Your Honor.
