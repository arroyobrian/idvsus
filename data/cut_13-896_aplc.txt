 (10:13 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

first this morning in Case 13896, Commil USA v. Cisco 

5

Systems. 

6

 Mr. Werbner. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK S. WERBNER 

8
9
10
11

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. WERBNER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 This case concerns whether an infringer, who 

12

bypasses myriad means of adjudicating patent validity 

13

and who then actively induces infringement, can escape 

14

responsibility simply by claiming that they believe the 

15

patent was invalid. 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, not claiming, but by 

proving. 
 MR. WERBNER: 

Well, they would have to prove 

19

that, Your Honor.  But we submit that the presumption of 

20

validity, especially because of that, it would be wrong 

21

to allow the infringer to escape liability in those 

22

instances.  If there's a mistake, it should be borne by 

23

the infringer who made the mistake. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You mentioned the 

presumption of validity.  What percentage of patents

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1
2

that are challenged are found to be valid? 
 MR. WERBNER: 

Well, Your Honor, from the 

3

briefing, it appears a high number; 40 percent was an 

4

estimate.  I don't know how 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, 40  40 

6

percent of the patents are  are found to be valid? 

7

Invalid. 

8

 MR. WERBNER: 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Invalid. 
Invalid.  So only 

10

60 percent are upheld.  That's not much of a presumption 

11

of validity. 

12

 MR. WERBNER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, I would 

13

submit that it would be for Congress to change the 

14

presumption of validity, if  if it's out of line.  The 

15

presumption has been part of patent law for several 

16

hundred years, even before the codification in 1952. 

17

And it's more than just a procedural mechanism, it's a 

18

message that patents are presumed valid.  They should 

19

be respected not just by judges and juries, but by the 

20

public who are told that until proven otherwise, patents 

21

are presumed valid.  And someone who wishes to gamble on 

22

their belief that it's invalid should bear the 

23

consequences if they're wrong. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

This question would come 

up only if the patent had been held valid, right?  And

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

the defense is although the patent is valid, we had a 

2

good faith belief that it was invalid. 

3

 MR. WERBNER: 

That's right, Justice 

4

Ginsburg.  It would basically give the accused infringer 

5

a second bite at the apple because they would have to 

6

have the patent found valid.  And then, if that went 

7

against them, then they would want a second chance to 

8

say even though they were mistaken, they believed that 

9

it was invalid. 

10

 And we think that giving them that second 

11

bite at the apple will eviscerate the effectiveness of 

12

Section 271(b), which is vital to protect the interest 

13

of patent owners.  And the 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The court below believed 

15

that there was no good faith basis to distinguish a good 

16

faith belief in lack of infringement from a good faith 

17

belief in  in validity.  How do you address that 

18

difference? 

19

 MR. WERBNER: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 MR. WERBNER: 

Justice Sotomayor 
Or is there one and why? 
There is a substantial 

22

difference, Your Honor, because we can see that  that 

23

validity and infringement are different.  I'd like to 

24

start with the statutory basis that makes that clear. 

25

271(b) says that whoever shall actively induce

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

infringement shall be liable as an infringer.  It speaks 

2

not at all to validity.  Validity is in a completely 

3

separate section of the Patent Act, section 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, but it's a  it's a 

5

it's a type of aiding and abetting liability and both 

6

at  in tort law and in criminal law.  At the common 

7

law, it was clear that you're not liable as an aider and 

8

abetter unless you have a wrongful intent.  If indeed 

9

your  and you acknowledge that  that part of this 

10

depends upon  upon wrongful intent, don't you?  You 

11

you say that it can't hinge upon the belief that the 

12

patent is invalid, but do you not acknowledge that you 

13

have to  you  you have to believe that you are 

14

inducing infringement of  of the invalid patent? 

15

 MR. WERBNER: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17
18

Well, indeed, Justice 
Where do you get that 

requirement from? 
 MR. WERBNER: 

Well, indeed, Justice Scalia, 

19

those are two separate.  The  and I acknowledge that, 

20

as the Court said in the GlobalTech matter, that some 

21

intent is required and that was found from the words 

22

"actively induce" in Section 271(b). 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, why just some intent? 

24

What  what good does it do to say, well, you know, 

25

you're really not a bad actor, but you're, you know 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

you're half a bad actor, that's enough.  It  it seems 

2

to me that  that if you don't know that you're 

3

infringing or that you're encouraging somebody to 

4

infringe is  is no  no worse than you're not knowing 

5

that the patent is valid. 

6

 MR. WERBNER: 

Well, under the court's Aro 2 

7

case that the Court described in GlobalTech's as a 

8

fixture of patent law, the Court specifically there 

9

recognized that once an accused infringer received 

10

actual notice of the patent and is put on notice of the 

11

infringing conduct, that that  that creates no defense 

12

to that person. 

13

 And I think the policy reason for that is 

14

that having actual knowledge of the patent goes a very 

15

long way in  in  in putting the person who then goes 

16

forward with knowledge of the patent different than in 

17

GlobalTech, and they infringe and they were on notice, 

18

they should be the ones, if I might say, who should have 

19

stopped when they had that notice, Your Honor, and gone 

20

to the myriad means of adjudicating patent validity. 

21

 Now under the America Invents Act, for 

22

example, there are streamlined procedures available.  So 

23

the wrongdoing arises when someone who has actual 

24

knowledge of the patent and is on notice from the patent 

25

owner of infringement, if they don't go to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

streamline procedures  and they can do a declaratory 

2

judgment, they can do the IPR, the interparties review 

3

at the Patent Office  then they are gambling on their 

4

belief.  And as between the patent owner and the accused 

5

who was on notice, it's wrong if the infringer with 

6

with that chooses not to pursue those methods. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you have a cause of 

8

action against the person who infringes, right?  And it 

9

doesn't matter whether he thinks the patent is invalid 

10

or not.  You  you got that person, don't you?  So this 

11

is sort of a supplemental cause of action against 

12

against somebody who induces, who aids and abets. 

13

 MR. WERBNER: 

Yes, Your Honor, that's 

14

that's true.  And the 271(a), the direct infringer, has 

15

strict liability.  But I submit that when we look at 

16

271(b) and (c), there shouldn't be this yawning gap 

17

between the aider and abetter and the  the direct 

18

infringer.  There should be more required 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But there is a common 

20

law  I mean, there  there was a common law, both 

21

civil and criminal.  The aider and abetter was really 

22

a  way beyond what it took to  to convict the person 

23

who committed the tort or  or committed the crime. 

24
25

 MR. WERBNER: 

Justice Scalia, it's true. 

But if we look at the restatement dealing with aiding

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

and abetting, we see that it depends.  There are several 

2

provisions that  that deal with aider and abetter, and 

3

the one that has the word "induce" in it requires a much 

4

lower scienter and intent, does the one who is 

5

assisting.  And  and that makes sense. 

6

 If I could point out one other statutory 

7

aspect, and I'm referring to what was  what is 

8

Footnote 6 on page 22 of the government's brief, there's 

9

an example there of three statutes that are very 

10

powerful in telling us what was meant by Congress in 

11

271(b), Footnote 6 on page 22. 

12

 The first, when we try to discern the 

13

textual meaning of 271(b), we need go no further than 

14

271(e)(5), that very same section.  And there, at the 

15

very end of that section, it talks about "the courts of 

16

the United States shall have subject matter jurisdiction 

17

for declaratory judgment that such patent"  this is 

18

the brand name patent  "is invalid or not infringed." 

19

And I'll give two more examples where we see where 

20

Congress knows the difference between invalidity and 

21

infringement.  Where Congress is addressing both, it 

22

says both.  And that was the first of three examples. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Werbner, suppose I have 

24

a product and I'm trying to figure out whether, if I 

25

sell this product, I'll have liability.  And there are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

two ways to construe a statute  construe a patent; one 

2

is narrow and one is broad.  And if the patent is 

3

construed narrowly, I won't be infringing it.  But if 

4

the patent is construed broadly, it's not valid.  Right? 

5

So I have two possible defenses, depending on whether 

6

the patent is construed narrowly or the patent is 

7

construed broadly. 

8
9

 Now, GlobalTech says that I have a good 
faith defense as to noninfringement, but you're 

10

suggesting I don't have that good faith defense as to 

11

invalidity.  And I guess I don't understand quite why 

12

that would make sense in the context that I'm talking 

13

about, which I think is a pretty typical context.  But 

14

it would seem that the two defenses are so intertwined 

15

and so two sides of the same coin that they should be 

16

treated in the same way. 

17

 MR. WERBNER: 

Justice Kagan, I  I 

18

understand the question.  And  and one of judges in 

19

the court below said in dissent they're not two sides of 

20

the same coin, they're actually two separate coins.  And 

21

I  I see the  the  where the issue arises in claim 

22

construction, but every party to a patent litigation is 

23

uncertain about claim construction, plaintiff and 

24

defendant.  And until a Markman hearing is had, no party 

25

knows for sure how the claim will be construed.  That's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1
2

just inherent in patent litigation. 
 If the person makes a judgment, as they have 

3

to, about what the claim constructions are and they 

4

think the patent doesn't infringe, then they are in a 

5

different situation if they have a question about 

6

validity.  And they have options.  Contrary to what my 

7

opponent says, there are options at that point.  If the 

8

person is not certain about claim construction as to 

9

whether there will be validity or not, they can do an 

10

IPR before the Patent Office, a new procedure that was 

11

part of the American Invents Act which can be resolved in 

12

18 months, and  and often stay the litigation.  They 

13

could go for declaratory judgment. 

14

 So my  my answer would  would be that, 

15

regardless of what leads them to their confusion, if 

16

they assumed the risk by  by proceeding, then  then 

17

if it turns out they're wrong, they  they should bear 

18

the risk as between 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you  you could say 

20

the same thing about  about whether they were 

21

infringing or not.  They could bring a declaratory 

22

judgment action as to whether they're fringing or not. 

23

And therefore, they don't have to gamble that they're 

24

that they're not infringing.  They can get a declaratory 

25

judgment.  So, you know, put the burden on them.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1
2
3

 Why do you do it for the one and not for the 
other?  That's  that's what I don't understand. 
 MR. WERBNER: 

Well, Your Honor, I would say 

4

that with respect to beliefs and invalidity, it's deeply 

5

ingrained in American law that there is a difference. 

6

And  for example, in the Cheek v. United States case, 

7

that distinction was made very clear, that's in the 

8

context of a criminal statute where the accused for tax 

9

evasion, raising all sorts of mistakes of law and the 

10

like, this Court held in that Cheek decision that one 

11

accused of violating the prohibition will not be heard 

12

to say they thought the prohibition was invalid or 

13

unconstitutional. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But that really does get 

15

back to the Chief Justice's opening question, because 

16

you're quite right in your reply brief when you say that 

17

this is a tradition in American law, that we assume that 

18

statutes are constitutional, that we assume that 

19

contracts are valid, that's right, but it's because they 

20

really are.  You know, almost all statutes are 

21

constitutional.  And here we're in a different universe 

22

entirely, aren't we?  Where, you know, you could flip a 

23

coin as to whether a patent is valid or invalid and be 

24

pretty close, right?  It's about 50/50. 

25

 MR. WERBNER: 

Well, the Congress has said

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

that there should be a presumption of validity and 

2

that's been the law and in the Court's opinion in i4i 

3

quoting Justice Cardozo about the force of the 

4

presumption and Judge Rich who explained the basis 

5

when  when the government acts to presume that it did 

6

so properly.  So maybe there is some step, but that's 

7

what I mean to say a  a gap between the current 

8

presumption and certain practices. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is that a  is that 

10

an historical development?  Did more of them used to be 

11

valid, however many decades ago and, it's sort of 

12

changed recently? 

13

 MR. WERBNER: 

I think more recently, 

14

there  there is more of an issue.  I'm not certain, 

15

Mr. Chief Justice, how  how the statistics were 

16

further back.  But I do know that Congress has responded 

17

very recently and the PTO is responding to the various 

18

issues, and that should be the mechanism, congressional 

19

action and  and PTO action, and not prejudice patent 

20

owners, who have not done anything wrong, who have 

21

gained their patent.  And, of course, in this case, it 

22

is a valid patent and Cisco not only was found to be 

23

infringing a valid patent, they went to the PTO to 

24

reexam this patent and it was found 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But you  you seem to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

arguing that notice is all that's needed.  But the whole 

2

point of GlobalTech was inquiry was encouraged.  And it 

3

seems to me that there's not a parallel or a symmetry 

4

between what you're arguing and what GlobalTech said. 

5

GlobalTech said, we want you to inquire.  You say, once 

6

you get a notice  and I'm sure these letters just come 

7

all the time, they're form letters  that that's it. 

8

 MR. WERBNER: 

Justice Kennedy, I don't think 

9

that it would be sufficient to be a form letter.  I know 

10

that the Respondent has raised questions about that, but 

11

I  I don't submit that it  it can just be a form 

12

letter or inadequate.  But  but I want to make my 

13

point clear as a matter of GlobalTech and infringement, 

14

because that's really different from the validity. 

15

There, I think, it would be helpful if the Court could 

16

clarify GlobalTech.  It was dealing with a situation 

17

where there wasn't knowledge of the patent.  So I think 

18

some of the statements there might  might, in the 

19

context of not knowing of the patent and willful 

20

blindness, be different. 

21

 I think Aro II, where there was knowledge of 

22

the patent, and this Court held very clearly that there 

23

would be no defense available once this person received 

24

the notice in the patent, I think that should guide the 

25

Court in the cases where there is knowledge of the

Alderson Reporting Company

patent.

 If I may reserve the rest of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 

8

Thank you. 
Ms. Anders. 

 SUPPORTING PETITIONER 

9

 MS. ANDERS: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Neither a good faith belief in 

12

noninfringement, nor a good faith belief in invalidity 

13

should preclude liability for inducing enforcement. 

14
15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Are you asking us to 

overturn GlobalTech and 

16

 MS. ANDERS: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MS. ANDERS: 

No. 
 Aro? 
No.  We don't think that the 

19

Court should overturn GlobalTech.  We think that 

20

GlobalTech clearly resolved the issue. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So if we read all the 

22

texts to mean that you have to have knowledge of the 

23

patent and knowledge that your activity infringes it, 

24

then your argument doesn't hold up. 

25

 MS. ANDERS: 

If that's how the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

understands GlobalTech, then we would say, like 

2

Petitioner, that  that even if you think that  that 

3

knowledge of the infringing nature of the acts is 

4

necessary, knowledge of invalidity is not also 

5

necessary. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So break up your 

7

argument if you would for me addressing both 

8

presumptions.  Because I think those are different 

9

arguments. 

10

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, so we think that if you 

11

look at GlobalTech, it doesn't clearly resolve the 

12

issue about whether knowledge of infringement 

13

knowledge of the infringing nature of the acts is 

14

necessary.  There's language in the opinion that states 

15

that knowledge of the patent would be sufficient to 

16

satisfy knowledge of the infringement.  The court also 

17

did not have to resolve the question about whether a 

18

good faith belief in noninfringement would be necessary 

19

because that was not presented in GlobalTech.  The 

20

defendant there had no arguments that even if he knew 

21

about the patent 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, there was an 

23

argument there that he didn't know that someone 

24

replacing a top infringed. 

25

 MS. ANDERS: 

I  if Your Honor 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

2

 MS. ANDERS: 

The fabric 
 is talking about Aro II in 

3

that case, what the Court said was that you need 

4

knowledge that the  that the use is infringing and the 

5

Court held that that knowledge was conclusively 

6

satisfied by the defendant's knowledge of the patent and 

7

knowledge of the link between the patent and the 

8

conduct.  I think there was no plausible argument there 

9

that the defendant had a good faith belief or  I'm 

10

sorry, that the defendant lacked a good faith belief 

11

that his conduct was not infringing.  The question of 

12

whether direct infringement was occurring was hotly 

13

contested.  It was litigated all the way up to the 

14

Supreme Court and back, and it closely divided the 

15

Justices 5/4.  So I think anyone would say that in that 

16

case, the defendant had a good faith belief in  in 

17

noninfringement. 

18

 Now, if I could just address why it makes 

19

sense, I think, to read GlobalTech and Aro this way and 

20

to not require knowledge of the 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Before you do that, Ms. 

22

Anders, I mean, it just does seem whatever the factual 

23

circumstances of that case were, we could not have been 

24

more clear about the breadth of the holding.  I mean, we 

25

just said, we now hold that induced infringement under

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

271(b) requires knowledge that the induced acts 

2

constitute patent infringement.  And your brief 

3

essentially puts a "not" in that sentence. 

4

 MS. ANDERS: 

With respect, Justice Kagan, I 

5

don't think that's so.  I think the  the sentence that 

6

immediately preceded the sentence that Your Honor just 

7

read said that it would be strange to hold that 

8

knowledge of the patent is needed under 271(c), but not 

9

271(b).  Accordingly, we now hold that knowledge that 

10

the induced acts constitute a patent infringement is 

11

necessary.  So I think that the Court may have equated 

12

the two things. 

13

 But  but just to go back to why I think it 

14

would make sense to read 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me, I don't 

16

understand what you just said.  It equated what two 

17

things?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Knowledge of the patent and 

knowledge that the patent is  is being infringed? 
 MS. ANDERS: 

Yes.  Yes.  This is what the 

Court did in Aro II.  I think the Court 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Are we that dumb, that 

that  that we would say those two things in successive

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

sentences? 

2

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, no.  I think it comes 

3

from Aro II, Your Honor.  What the Court said in Aro II 

4

was the knowledge of infringement is necessary and the 

5

Court said the defendant has no defense that he lacked 

6

knowledge of infringement when he possessed knowledge of 

7

the patent and knowledge of the accusation of 

8

infringement.  So I think that's where this language 

9

comes from. 

10

 But again, just to address both why this 

11

makes sense and why I think it makes sense to say that a 

12

good faith belief in invalidity is not a defense even 

13

even though 40 percent of patents may be invalid. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I hope you'll spend 

15

concentrate on that because that's the crux of this 

16

case.  I mean, that's what the Federal circuit majority 

17

said, that there's no principal difference between the 

18

two.  And if you could make sure that you  if you 

19

think there is a principal difference, tell us what it 

20

is. 

21

 MS. ANDERS: 

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I'll 

22

address that.  But first I'd like to say that I think a 

23

key point here is that if the inducer is right that the 

24

patent is invalid, or that it's not infringed, he will 

25

not be liable because the Court will find that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

patent was invalid or not infringed.  And so in that 

2

case, you don't have to worry about liability.  So the 

3

question is really what should happen when the defendant 

4

is wrong?  Right.  Who should bear the risk of the 

5

defendants being wrong that the patent is invalid or 

6

or not infringed?  And we think the inducer should bear 

7

the burden.  This is  this is someone who knows about 

8

the patent, who has considered it, who has decided not 

9

to challenge, not to use the statutory mechanisms that 

10
11

Congress has provided to challenge the patent. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The patentee has a cause of 

12

action against the person who  who violates the 

13

patent, right?  You're just talking about supplemental 

14

liability for somebody who induced that  that 

15

violation.  And generally, for that kind of liability, 

16

we have required mens rea.  We have required knowledge 

17

that you're doing something wrong. 

18

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, two points with respect 

19

to that.  The first point is that certainly in the 

20

criminal law, you may need wrongful intent when you're an 

21

aider and abetter, but you do not need knowledge that 

22

the principal offense is illegal.  So, for instance, if 

23

you're aiding and abetting a felon to possess a gun, you 

24

need to know that you're selling them a gun and that 

25

they're a felon.  You don't need to know that it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

illegal for the  for a felon to possess a gun.  So we 

2

think that's analogous here. 

3

 The second point I would make is that 271(b) 

4

is not simply supplemental liability, it is an 

5

important means of enforcing 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Have we held that, what you 

7

just said?  Has this Court held that?  Do we have a case 

8

in this Court that says that? 

9
10

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think that's a 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You  you can be liable 

11

for aiding and abetting a felony when you don't know 

12

that it's a felony? 

13

 MS. ANDERS: 

You don't have to know that the 

14

underlying conduct is illegal, yes, that's right.  I 

15

think that's a principle of the common law.  I  I 

16

think you see that in the criminal law treatises for 

17

certainly. 

18

 But  but 271(b), I think, is  Congress 

19

intended that to be available to enforce patent rights 

20

when it would be impracticable for patentholders to 

21

to file suit directly against a direct infringer.  So 

22

situations like the Grokster scenario where you have 

23

millions of direct infringers, you need to go after the 

24

person who is inducing that conduct 

25

 But to go back to Justice Ginsburg's point

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

about why would it make sense to treat the two issues 

2

differently, I think there are three reasons that 

3

that you would do so.  The first is that even though, 

4

as  as Justice Kagan said, claim construction can be a 

5

common subsidiary issue in both noninfringement 

6

questions and invalidity issues, I don't think it's 

7

anomalous to still treat the two issues as separate. 

8
9

 For instance, in Chief v. United States, the 
Court  it  it's clear that in  in the statutory 

10

context, you might have a question about statutory 

11

construction that would be relevant to whether you're 

12

violating the statute, and that same question might be 

13

relevant to the validity of the statute, but the Court 

14

still said that your belief that you  that  that the 

15

statute was invalid did not negate your stand with 

16

respect to whether you're violating the law. 

17

 And as to 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You said on a  a 

19

couple of times about the idea of  of difficulty of 

20

going after all the little people.  But why is that?  It 

21

would seem to me that once you have a few successful 

22

suits against the users rather than inducers, both the 

23

users and the inducer will get the message and not 

24

not continue on with the infringement. 

25

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, I'm not sure that that's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

 that's always going to be the case as a practical 

2

matter.  I think there may be situations in  in which, 

3

you know, the  the users may have  the direct users 

4

may have immunities.  For instance, the Patent Act 

5

provides, in the context of surgical materials, that 

6

doctors can't be directly liable for infringement, so 

7

the only  the only course there is to go after the 

8

inducer. 

9

 So I think that Congress anticipated in the 

10

Patent Act that inducement would be an independent means 

11

of imposing liability. 

12

 But to go back to the  the two reasons 

13

that it may make sense as a policy matter to treat 

14

invalidity and noninfringement differently, I think one 

15

of them is that invalidity questions can be even harder 

16

and more complex to determine.  I think it's important 

17

to keep in mind here that  that what we're saying is 

18

that the defendant would have a  he would be able to 

19

immunize himself from liability based on his good faith 

20

belief with respect to anticipation, whether there's 

21

prior art that  that may make it obvious to a person 

22

skilled in the art 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course, that  that's 

24

not your position, is it?  I mean, the United States 

25

would treat the both the same, right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

 MS. ANDERS: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That is our 
The United States says you 

3

don't have to know either one.  You  you  it doesn't 

4

matter. 

5
6

 MS. ANDERS: 

That is our frontline position, 

but we  we 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

 MS. SANDERS: 

9

Yes. 
 of course acknowledge that 

the Court may understand GlobalTech differently than we 

10

do, and in that case we think that there are  there 

11

are reasons 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The differences are not 

13

enough to persuade you, but you think they should be 

14

enough to persuade us.  Is that it? 

15

 MS. ANDERS: 

No.  I think as a  I think 

16

our  our primary point is that it's not usually the 

17

case in the law that we require defendants to have 

18

knowledge that they will ultimately be held liable, that 

19

they have no good faith arguments about, you know, 

20

complex legal questions, technical factual questions, 

21

claim construction questions.  That is not usually the 

22

way it works in the law. 

23

 But even when a defendant may need knowledge 

24

that his conduct is illegal, it is not the case that 

25

that a belief that  that the underlying legal duty is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1
2

invalid, would  would negate that scienter. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What you just said 

3

does sound like an argument that GlobalTech was  was 

4

wrong. 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

Again, I don't think it is, 

6

Your Honor, because, again, even if you understand 

7

GlobalTech to require knowledge of infringement, we 

8

think there are reasons to treat infringement 

9

differently. 

10

 And I go back to the statute here. 

If you 

11

assume that 271(b) requires knowledge with respect to 

12

the fact that the acts constitute infringement, 

13

infringement is defined in 271(a).  Infringement is 

14

defined as practicing the elements of the patent without 

15

authorization.  The validity of the patent is not an 

16

element of the plaintiff's cause of action, so it is 

17

possible to establish infringement without establishing 

18

the validity of the patent. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You have infringed a 

20

nonpatent, right?  I mean, it  I guess you could say 

21

that, but 

22

 MS. ANDERS: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24
25

No. 
 and we have many cases 

that say you can't infringe an invalid patent. 
 MS. ANDERS: 

I think 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MS. ANDERS: 

We say that often. 
I think Congress made clear 

3

that infringe  that invalidity is something that 

4

prevents liability from infringement.  It does not 

5

prevent infringement from occurring.  Once the PTO has 

6

granted a patent, that patent exists and it can be 

7

infringed.  271(a) says 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There are two different 

burdens, aren't there, for infringement and for 

10

invalidity?  Infringement, the patent owner bears the 

11

burden of proving that the other is fringing; and for 

12

invalidity, the  the other side bears the burden.  So 

13

they are treated differently 

14

 MS. ANDERS: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

17

 MS. ANDERS: 

That's correct.  I 
 in the law. 
Briefly. 

I think 271(a) makes clear that 

18

because of the presumption of validity, infringement and 

19

invalidity are separate issues.  The patentee does not 

20

have to prove validity in order to establish 

21

infringement. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

23

 Mr. Waxman. 

24

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

25

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Alderson Reporting Company

Thank you, counsel. 

Official

27
1

 MR. WAXMAN: 

2

please the Court: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

3

 As this Court explained in Grokster and in 

4

GlobalTech, the linchpin of scienter for inducement 

5

liability is knowledge that the induced acts, quote, 

6

"violate the rights of the patentee."  Because 

7

practicing an invalid patent violates no such right of a 

8

patentee, an accused inducer who reasonably believes in 

9

good faith that a patent is void lacks the scienter 

10

required for liability under Section 271(b). 

11
12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what does that do to 

the presumption? 

13

 MR. WAXMAN: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The 
If the presumption is 

15

that a patent is invalid until you prove, you have the 

16

burden  that a patent is valid, you have the burden to 

17

prove it's invalid, your position basically says, no, I 

18

don't have to prove it, I just have to show I had a good 

19

faith basis. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, no, no, no.  I mean, in 

21

order to invalidate a patent in court, the party urging 

22

that the patent is invalid bears the burden of proving 

23

invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.  That's 

24

actually not the burden if you challenge it before the 

25

PTO.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

 But it is a high burden, and it's 

2

appropriately high because once a patent is declared 

3

invalid, it is unenforceable against anybody for all 

4

time and under principles of  under the BlonderTongue 

5

principles, a patentee who loses once is gone.  And 

6

there  this case, of course, and the issue in this 

7

case only arises, as all specific intent cases arise, 

8

only where there is otherwise established a cause of 

9

action. 

10

 So, in other words, the good faith belief 

11

either that the patent wasn't being infringed by the 

12

direct infringers or was a void patent will arise only 

13

when a court or the PTO has concluded that the patent is 

14

indeed valid.  And when  and the only issue in this 

15

case is will it  that it is the  the plaintiff's 

16

duty, the plaintiff's burden to prove scienter.  And 

17

as  as Aro suggests, and GlobalTech affirms, if the 

18

plaintiff comes forward and says, I sent him a letter 

19

identifying the patent and expressing my belief that the 

20

patent is infringed, if the  if the defendant doesn't 

21

have anything else to say, that can be viewed as 

22

permitting the jury to conclude that, in fact, the 

23

defendant had scienter. 

24
25

 The only issue in this case is what the 
defendant can say in response to the scienter element,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

an element that does apply, as Justice Scalia was 

2

pointing out, at common law for aiding and abetting 

3

liability.  And the  the jury will certainly be told 

4

after the 

5

and abetting.  You're

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you're not aiding 

I'm sorry? 
 induce  you're not 

aiding and abetting.  You're inducing. 

10

 MR. WAXMAN: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So 
You're  you're 

12

actually it's like I want  you're  you're appointing 

13

a surrogate and you're saying, you do it for me, but you 

14

do it. 

15

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, I  I want to get to my 

16

last point about what the jury will be instructed, but 

17

let me first, with all due respect, take on that 

18

assertion. 

19

 When Congress enacted Section 271(b) and 

20

Section 271(c) in 1952, both the House report and the 

21

Senate report said two things about those provisions: 

22

Number one, that they were enacted to reflect common law 

23

principles of aiding and abetting liability, and that 

24

they were thus, quote, "an expression of law and 

25

morals."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

 And this Court in GlobalTech precisely 

2

recognized that these provisions are, in fact, the 

3

modern day statutory version of civil aiding and 

4

abetting.  The Federal Circuit has always recognized it. 

5

And aiding and abetting at common law absolutely require 

6

knowledge of wrongdoing. 

7

 And just to get to your original question, 

8

in a case in which the jury has found that the patent is 

9

valid and the plaintiff goes on to say, you know, and 

10

there was appropriate scienter because  and it's quite 

11

unlike this case because there was no letter  a letter 

12

was sent saying, I have this, the '395 patent, and 

13

here's why you infringe it, you've heard the defendant 

14

explain why he or she or it nonetheless had a reasonable 

15

good faith belief that the patent was void. 

16

 In  in evaluating the reasonableness and 

17

good faith of that expressed belief, you need to take 

18

into account that under the patent laws, patents 

19

issued patents are presumed valid and that in order 

20

to  in order to establish the invalidity of a patent 

21

in court, as I have otherwise instructed you, the 

22

defendant has to prove invalidity by clear and 

23

convincing evidence, and that's what you should take 

24

into account when you are evaluating the defendant's 

25

profession of a good faith belief.  And 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

2

 MR. WAXMAN: 

If you  go ahead. 

No  I'm sorry.  I was just 

3

going to  just going to Justice Kagan's point, the 

4

about, you know, the two sides of the coin or two 

5

different coins, whatever metaphor you want to use, what 

6

the  what happens in the paradigmatic case  and it 

7

actually happened in this case when the lawsuit was 

8

filed is the defendant looks at the claim that it has a 

9

method that is violating this patent and it may seek 

10

legal counsel.  And what it found in this case and what 

11

it would testify to if it were allowed is we looked at 

12

these  at this patent.  This patent seems to, by all 

13

intents and purposes, claim Bluetooth technology, and if 

14

the patent is construed narrowly as we think it should 

15

be, our customers are not practicing the steps. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that seems to 

17

me to go to the application in your case.  But to step 

18

back, if you regard the patent as law, it seems to me 

19

that your position is really just ignorance of the law 

20

as an excuse. 

21

 MR. WAXMAN: 

No, no, no.  We are not  not 

22

at all, Mr. Chief Justice.  We are not arguing at all 

23

for a freestanding defense of a mistake of law.  We're 

24

not arguing here  or there was a reference to Cheek. 

25

We're not claiming that there is a reasonable good faith

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

defense in a belief that the patent laws are 

2

unconstitutional or that they don't imply  apply 

3

secondary liability or even, we don't  it wouldn't be 

4

a reasonable good faith belief. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No.  But if the 

6

patent  you don't have to say the patent laws are 

7

unconstitutional, but if you regard the patent more as 

8

law rather than  than contract, and it does apply 

9

against the whole confer legal rights against the whole 

10

world 

11

 MR. WAXMAN: 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
 and you say, 

13

well, even if we turn out to have been wrong about what 

14

that law means, what that patent means, we still have a 

15

valid defense. 

16

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, what the law means and 

17

what a patent means are two very different things.  And 

18

I think that really is the crux of what I should have 

19

started saying.  There's no dispute that practicing all 

20

of the steps of a patented invention is unlawful and a 

21

defense of a belief that it wasn't wouldn't be a 

22

defense.  But invalidity defenses are not disputes about 

23

the  the parameters or the scope of the  of Section 

24

102 or 103 or 112.  Invalidity defenses are utterly 

25

factual.  Several of them the Supreme Court  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

Federal circuit has said are purely factual, and the 

2

other ones that aren't are questions of law that 

3

depend  that are resolved completely by resolution of 

4

facts.  And the government, in its brief at Page 30, 

5

acknowledges and extolls this.  So a contention that 

6

there is a reasonable good faith that a patent is void 

7

is not arguing about the legality of anything.  It 

8

argues about the force of the issued document. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I'm not sure what 

10

you're saying.  I mean, even take a typical contract 

11

case.  Typical contract cases, somebody sues you for 

12

breach of contract and you say, oh, I thought that the 

13

contract was invalid.  It's true.  I would have breached 

14

it if it were valid, but I thought the contract was 

15

invalid.  That usually does not allow  that's not a 

16

good defense.  I mean, if it turns out that the contract 

17

was invalid, you win.  But if the contract was valid, 

18

you lose even though you thought the contract was 

19

invalid.  And so, too, here it would seem to me. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

And that is exactly the rule 

21

that  I mean, contract breach is a  it's not a tort, 

22

but it's the analogy to a direct tort.  It's analogous 

23

to the direct infringer.  On the contrary, at common 

24

law, tortious interference required an act that was not 

25

only intentional but, quote, "improper."  And that's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

reflected in Section 766 of the first restatement of 

2

torts under tortious interference. 

3

 And there are  many, many courts have 

4

understood and construed that word "improper" to require 

5

a belief that the contract  that you were tortiously 

6

interfering with a contract that is, in fact, valid, and 

7

many courts have allowed the third party, the 

8

aider  essentially, aider and abetter a defense 

9

that they believe that, you know, this was a contract 

10

for the supply of alcohol during prohibition.  And 

11

juries have found a lack of scienter and a lack of 

12

thirdparty liability at common law for the absence of 

13

that belief. 

14

 I mean, at common law  and this Court 

15

in  in the Court's Central Bank of Denver v. First 

16

Interstate Bank of Denver, which was a private 

17

securities action, has a long treatment of the history 

18

of civil aiding and abetting liability and underscores 

19

what the treatises reflect, which is that thirdparty 

20

liability for a nonculpable wrongful act was 

21

exceptionally rare.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But as Ms. Anders made 

23

the point that in  in the patent context, it's the 

24

aider and abetter or the inducer is the mastermind and 

25

then the aider and abetter is selling the allegedly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

infringing device to a lot of customers.  And as between 

2

those two, it's much more effective to go after the 

3

person who is supplying the alleged  the infringing 

4

device. 

5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, in some 

6

contexts it is; in some contexts it isn't.  When, you 

7

know, Walmart or McDonald's get a letter from Commil 

8

saying that you are infringing our patent because you're 

9

using the  you know, Cisco provided wide area network, 

10

a couple things happen.  We're talking about the 

11

practicalities of things. 

12

 In the first place, companies like Cisco 

13

all  it is a commonplace to have an indemnification 

14

for customers saying if you're sued for patent 

15

infringement, we will take over the defense and we are 

16

liable.  And even if they don't have that, it obviously 

17

is going to do a company like Cisco or, heaven forbid, a 

18

smaller, you know, innovative company to say, well, you 

19

know, they can't really reach us.  They're just suing 

20

our customers.  And in practice, what sometimes happens, 

21

even in the absence of an indemnification agreement, is 

22

the manufacturer, whether it's Cisco or Apple or 

23

whoever, will intervene in the action or file an 

24

individual dec action to take on the very question.  And 

25

so in the real world of litigation, this issue is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1
2

resolved. 
 Now, on the Chief Justice's question about 

3

how valid are patents, I mean, the  the answer is the 

4

statistics have changed over time. 

5

 At  at page 49 of our brief, we cite a 

6

1998 study that showed that patents were invalidated 46 

7

percent of the time.  In 2002, a study was done of 

8

Federal circuit decisions between 2003 and 2009 and 

9

found that patents  challenged patents were 

10

invalidated 60 percent of the time.  And I do think that 

11

in light of this Court's explication of the bounds of 

12

certain validity principles in Alice Corp. as to 

13

business method patents, Nautilus as to indefiniteness, 

14

Mayo as to patentable subject matter, KSR as to 

15

obviousness, there's no question that that number is 

16

going to go up. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but that might be a 

18

very good reason for Congress to take a new look at this 

19

presumption of validity.  But your problem is that this 

20

presumption of validity exists and that this question of 

21

validity functions in a patent suit only as an 

22

affirmative defense. 

23

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So I don't  I  maybe I'm 

24

seeing this wrong, but I don't actually see the 

25

presumption of validity as a problem.  The presumption

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

of the validity raises the bar of proving to a jury that 

2

you had a reasonable good faith belief that this patent 

3

would be invalidated; that you have to  it wouldn't be 

4

reasonable to assume, oh, I think I can prove by 51 

5

percent that it's invalid, or I think it's 51 percent 

6

likely. 

7

 The  the reasonableness in good faith of 

8

your profession has to be evaluated against the high bar 

9

that you will face in court.  And the  the flip side 

10

of the coin is so one of these letters comes in and 

11

and Cisco  I mean, we've seen the government's 

12

statistics are 60 to  60 to 100,000 of these letters a 

13

year.  Cisco gets way more than one letter every day.  I 

14

mean, they're sued twice a year.  Every time they get a 

15

letter, according to the government and according to 

16

Commil, what they are supposed to do is shut down the 

17

production line, tell all of the customers who've bought 

18

their technology, oh, no, no, the patent is presumed 

19

valid, you should stop; otherwise, you'll be infringing 

20

while they do what they did, which is to file an action 

21

in the PTO to seek a declaration of invalidity. 

22
23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's only a 

problem if you turn out to be wrong. 

24

 MR. WAXMAN: 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Exactly. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Right?  I mean, so

Official

38
1

why shouldn't you bear that risk?  Why do you require 

2

the patent holder to lose the value of his patent until 

3

you get around to deciding the validity or the  the 

4

infringement suit is solved? 

5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So I think a couple of answers. 

6

First of all, it is not the  I mean, you could 

7

establish an a priori rule that says, since all we're 

8

talking about here is retrospective damages looking back 

9

from the adjudication of invalidity, and then that 

10

the  that the direct infringers are practicing all of 

11

the steps. 

12

 And the question just is, whose  who bears 

13

the burden of that  of those retrospective damages. 

14

Where the common law put it under aiding and abetting 

15

liability, and where 271(b) and 271(c) put it, as this 

16

Court has explained in Grokster and in GlobalTech, is 

17

to leave it for the jury.  The jury is told, this entity 

18

is accused of inducing infringement or contributory 

19

infringement, and you therefore need to find, in the 

20

first instance, that some entity was, in fact  could 

21

be, quote, immersed as a direct infringer, to quote this 

22

Court's opinion in Aro.  If you do that, aiding and 

23

abetting liability will follow if the plaintiff 

24

establishes three separate tests, one of which is 

25

scienter.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

 And the jury will  and you need to 

2

evaluate whether, in fact, the plaintiff has established 

3

scienter.  If the plaintiff establishes scienter, then 

4

the alleged  the alleged inducer is an adjudicated 

5

inducer and is, in fact, responsible for all of those 

6

damages. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I still don't 

8

understand.  I mean, you posit that you know that your 

9

steps, if the patent is valid, infringe. 

10

 MR. WAXMAN: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. 
You know, an  for 

12

inducement, you have to prove that the person knows that 

13

they're infringing.  The next question is, are they 

14

liable for it, and that issue has to do with validity; a 

15

second question. 

16

 So I don't know why the patent owner has to 

17

suffer the loss of royalties to your gamble that the 

18

patent is void, because presumably they've proven that 

19

you knew your steps infringed. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So I 
So you knew that, at 

22

least on the terms of the patent as it exists, you 

23

violated. 

24
25

 MR. WAXMAN: 

I have a doctrinal  my answer 

has a doctrinal portion and a practical, realworld

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

portion.  The doctrinal portion is simply the statement 

2

that was made by somebody on the bench, and  and I'll 

3

just quote Justice Black in his dissenting opinion in 

4

Exhibit Supply, which began with a statement that was 

5

agreed  was  was started as common ground, where 

6

he  he said, there can be no infringement of a void 

7

patent.  And if you  and  and there are 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

May I  may I stop you 

9

at that point and ask how does that compare with what 

10

Charles Rich said, which is  and I think this is in 

11

the government's brief and I'm sure that you know it 

12

assertion that invalid claims can't be infringed is a 

13

nonsense statement. 

14

 What do you suppose he meant by that? 

15

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Okay.  First of all, Charles 

16

Rich, Judge Rich, Chief Judge Rich, held for the court 

17

in Richdel, which was, which was decided in 1983 at the 

18

very outset of the Federal Circuit's creation, this was 

19

the holding of Richdel, that if a claim is invalid, 

20

there is nothing to be infringed. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, that 
What he meant  what he meant 

23

when he made the statement that you've quoted was 

24

accurate in the very peculiar context of that case. 

25

Because in that case, there was, in fact, a claim of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

invalidity under best mode, and there was a claim that 

2

the steps of the method or the combination were not 

3

being practiced. 

4
5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, then what's 

what's 

6

 MR. WAXMAN: 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But because of  may I just 
You're making this 

8

casespecific.  But he also said, courts constantly hold 

9

claims infringed, but invalid. 

10

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So what that means is, if I can 

11

just finish my point on the case that he was deciding, 

12

and what it made  why it made sense for  because of 

13

a reason of the quirk of the case, the best mode defense 

14

of invalidity was not presented to the jury.  And he was 

15

simply saying that it was wrong to say that by having 

16

found the  the question of whether all the steps were 

17

practiced or in that case, not, he necessarily  the 

18

jury necessarily made a finding on invalidity. 

19

 What  what the more general statement, 

20

Justice Ginsburg, reflects is the fact that infringement 

21

can be referred to  I mean, it  there are, as was 

22

pointed out, separate defenses.  One is the first  in 

23

271(a) or 282(a)  (a)(1), is you're not practicing all 

24

of the steps of the claimed invention, and that is 

25

vernacularly referred to as noninfringement.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

 The claim that a patent is valid depends on 

2

a  or invalid depends on a showing that it doesn't 

3

satisfy Sections 102, 103, or 112 of the Patent Act, and 

4

is a  is a showing that, if made, will invalidate the 

5

patent against everybody, not just the defendant in the 

6

case. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought  and maybe 

8

correct me if I'm wrong  that what this meant was 

9

thinking of how it comes up in litigation.  So you're in 

10

the district court, and you have  let's say you're the 

11

alleged infringer or contributory infringer or inducer, 

12

so you say, number one, the patent is invalid; and, 

13

number two, if it's valid, it was not infringed. 

14

 So in the court of first instance, both of 

15

those issues are discrete in the sense that I am arguing 

16

it's not valid, so no patent is out of it; but if I'm 

17

wrong about that, it wasn't infringed.  So though 

18

those are discrete inquiries. 

19

 MR. WAXMAN: 

There's  there's  we're not 

20

disputing that they're discrete inquiries.  The validity 

21

of the  a  a finding of infringement, the ability 

22

to, as this Court put it in Aro 1, immerse a defendant 

23

as an infringer presupposes that there is, in fact 

24

someone is practicing all the steps of a valid patent. 

25

That is  that's indisputable.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

 It's simply  it is a nonsense statement to 

2

say that you can be immersed as an infringer of a void 

3

patent.  The patent provides rights.  The rights to 

4

exclude; the right to withhold authorization within the 

5

meaning of 271(a), defining infringement.  If you have 

6

no ability, no legal right to withhold authorization, 

7

you don't have a legal right that's being violated if 

8

somebody practices the claimed steps. 

9

 Now, I do want to make a couple of points 

10

well, first, I should go back to the  let me try to 

11

remember my practical side of Justice  the answer to 

12

Justice Sotomayor's question.  I wish I could remember 

13

it, because it was really good.  Maybe I'll  maybe 

14

I'll 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Your answer  your 

answer was really good or my question? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

No, no, your question was good, 

18

but my answer was also good, and it will probably come 

19

to me on the walk back to my office. 

20
21
22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I have forgotten the 

question.  What was  what was the question? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

So I think the question was 

well, what was the question? 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Waxman, as a  as a 

company that's in this position, the company has other

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

alternatives.  It can go to court and seek a declaratory 

2

judgment, it can go to the PTAB, it can go to the PTO, 

3

it can do all of these things essentially to figure out 

4

whether the patent is valid.  And those things also have 

5

the side benefit of getting invalid patents struck so 

6

that nobody else will have to deal with them either. 

7

 So why isn't that the right way to 

8

understand this system, is that, no, rather than come 

9

rather than allow a company to come in and do what we 

10

don't allow in any other context, as far as I can see, 

11

which is to plead a good faith belief in the invalidity 

12

of the patent, that, no, we  we say to them, yes, we 

13

understand you have a question, Congress has set up many 

14

mechanisms for you to get an answer to that question, 

15

use one of those mechanisms. 

16

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Okay.  So, I mean, look, I'm 

17

our argument isn't principally a policy argument, but 

18

I'll give you the policy answer to your question.  The 

19

legal answer is that 271(b) and (c) liability is a 

20

validly and recognized as a statutory instantiation of 

21

civil aiding and abetting liability.  And thirdparty 

22

liability at common law was a rarity and a particular 

23

rarity in the absence of culpability. 

24

 But as to your question, so Cisco is a big 

25

company and it has a lot of resources.  It's true that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

it gets hundreds or thousands of these letters every 

2

year.  And if the notion that it should run into court 

3

and institute an action every time somebody with a 

4

business method patent that seems now pretty clearly 

5

invalid under this Court's decision in Alice has to 

6

begin patent litigation and stop  stop the production 

7

line and tell all of its customers not to do it, I 

8

think, would be an odd practical remedy. 

9

 The question here is: 

What about a company 

10

that's perhaps a less  that's Cisco 20 years ago.  You 

11

know, an innovative company that is making products that 

12

people can use.  It gets a letter and it looks at this 

13

letter and says, gee, you know, if the patent is 

14

construed the way we think it should be construed, we 

15

don't think our customers are violating it, and if it's 

16

construed broadly, it's probably void because of X, Y, 

17

or Z. 

18

 If we go to court  first of all, we will 

19

have to shut down our only means of  you know, we have 

20

to shut down our production line, we have to tell our 

21

customer to stop using it and we get to go to court and 

22

litigate what probably will be a $1 million to 

23

$10 million case, which if we don't shut our production 

24

line, we will be retrospectively liable for all the 

25

damages that occurred.  And the paradigm of what happens

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

here is  again, this is getting back to a point that I 

2

do remember that you made, which is the two sides of the 

3

coin  what the lower court held  what the trial 

4

court held was that under GlobalTech, it had to allow 

5

Cisco in  on the issue of scienter to explain why it 

6

had a good faith belief that the patent was not 

7

infringed.  But it was not allowed to explain why, if 

8

the  all the steps  if the claim  if the patent 

9

were construed so as to encompass what Cisco does, it 

10

would be invalid for lack of enablement or written 

11

description.  And  which is exactly what happened. 

12

 And so the defense that Cisco was allowed to 

13

make at trial was the sound of one hand clapping 

14

whereas what Cisco did, once it received notice of this 

15

suit, was to  to do an analysis and say, this appears 

16

to claim only Bluetooth, we don't do Bluetooth, so our 

17

customers are not practicing the steps.  But if this 

18

were construed broadly enough to include the protocols 

19

that we are involved in, it would be anticipated and in 

20

any event, there's no enablement or a written 

21

description of how to do it. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

That goes to  that 

goes to rolling the dice. 

24

 MR. WAXMAN: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, yes. 
Meaning if you 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

 MR. WAXMAN: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But 
Infringement is one 

3

thing.  If you have a good faith belief, you've done the 

4

inquiry, the one that Justice Kennedy talked about, that 

5

was the premise of GlobalTech, which is there's a valid 

6

patent out there, you have to give a reason why your 

7

steps don't infringe their steps. 

8

 MR. WAXMAN: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You have to give 
If you can do that, 

10

that's fine.  If you can't, if  once you've done, 

11

you've lost on that, then you've rolled the dice.  Why 

12

should the patent owner now be deprived of the value of

13

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Justice Sotomayor, you are 

14

rolling the dice no matter what.  Because if you can't 

15

convince  you need to be able to convince a jury that 

16

notwithstanding the  whatever proof the plaintiff has 

17

that you were on notice of the patent and a claim of 

18

infringement, that your scienter, which after all is 

19

measured by what you believe, not why what the other 

20

side tells you to believe, you are  if the jury can 

21

only evaluate half of the thought process of the 

22

defendant, the defendant says, if it's narrowly 

23

construed, the  the steps aren't practiced; if it's 

24

broadly construed, it's invalid.  But when you get to 

25

the jury, the only thing you're allowed to tell the jury

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

is, well, I believed that if it was narrowly construed, 

2

we wouldn't be practicing this.  That's not a real 

3

that's not giving the jury the benefit of what you 

4

believed. 

5

 And again, all this case is about, it's not 

6

about immunizing anything.  It's about what the jury 

7

will hear if the defendant has anything to say about its 

8

scienter in response to a prima facia showing by the 

9

plaintiff that the defendant knew of the patent and that 

10
11

it  the patent was being infringed. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is there  this is  we 

12

have no question, right, that validity or invalidity is 

13

an affirmative defense? 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Correct. 
Is that correct?  I mean, is 

16

there any other area of law where the defendant gets to 

17

say, I thought an affirmative defense would be 

18

available?  It turned out I was wrong, but I thought an 

19

affirmative defense would be available. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Oh, I think, if you  may I 
Sure. 

Quickly.  Any of the common 

23

law, any of the  if you go back to the common law and 

24

look at instances where aiding and abetting liability, 

25

which as this Court pointed out is referenced in 876(b)

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49

of the first restatement, that defense was available.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK S. WERBNER 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. WERBNER: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

10

 Justice Kagan, to your question just now, I 

11

know of no other area of the law where a defendant, if 

12

it turns out they're right, they win, and if it turns 

13

out they're wrong, they win.  That's the position that 

14

Cisco is seeking. 

15
16
17

 And the parade of horribles of having to 
shut down the factory 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You're argument goes too 

18

far, because that's the same for infringement.  If you 

19

don't think you're infringing and you have a good faith 

20

basis, you're right. 

21

 MR. WERBNER: 

Well, there  there is the 

22

in my mind, the fact is, is that Cisco in their amici 

23

pressed Congress to create through the PTO the IPR 

24

procedures.  It's not a million dollar lawsuit, and it's 

25

not one that goes on forever.  They have many lawyers

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

that can evaluate the risk and go to the PTO.  That's 

2

where they should go if they're seeking validity. 

3

Infringement you can't go to the PTO, but the IPR allows 

4

that. 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course your response to 

6

the  the assertion that your  your argument goes too 

7

far is well, we don't  we don't agree that  that it 

8

applies to whether you've infringed, right?  I mean, 

9

your argument is even  even the question of 

10

infringement, despite what we said in GlobalTech, that 

11

is not a defense either, right?  So at least you're 

12

consistent. 

13

 MR. WERBNER: 

Well, Justice Scalia, I do 

14

want to point out that Cisco cannot point to a single 

15

statutory provision that suggests that Congress thought 

16

that the validity of the patent was an element of 

17

271(b). 

18

 So, no matter how the Court comes out on the 

19

noninfringement scienter and the GlobalTech, 

20

regardless, our position doesn't depend on it and  and 

21

there's no statutory support for validity being a 

22

component of a 271(b).  And the reference was to 

23

BlonderTongue?  That  that case that this Court 

24

decided back in, I think, the early '70s said that a 

25

jury finding or a judge that a patent is invalid doesn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

wipe it out.  It's not  it doesn't become void or 

2

canceled.  It's a matter of collateral estoppel that has 

3

to be pled under Rule 8(c).  And if a defendant later 

4

does not, then that patent was infringing an invalid 

5

patent because it's an affirmative defense. 

6

 So I think the BlonderTongue case really 

7

completely undermines the position that  that 

8

infringement presupposes validity.  It's quite separate, 

9

it's quite distinct and for the reasons we stated, we 

10

would ask that the case be reversed and remanded to the 

11

Federal circuit unless there are questions. 

12

 Thank you.
