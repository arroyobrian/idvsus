 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

5

 Mr. Pincus. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 

7

10

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. PINCUS: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court: 
 Florida punished the candidate seeking 

11

election to judicial office because she signed form 

12

letters and a Web posting soliciting contributions to 

13

her campaign committee, contributions that were 

14

completely lawful under Florida law.  The First 

15

Amendment bars Florida from prohibiting that speech. 

16

 The threshold question, of course, is what 

17

standard of review.  We submit that strict scrutiny 

18

applies, the standard that was applied by the court 

19

below, for several reasons.  First of all, this is 

20

obviously a contentbased restriction.  It turns on the 

21

content of the speech, does it solicit a campaign 

22

contribution. 

23

 My friend relies on this Court's decision in 

24

McConnell to justify applying the closely drawn scrutiny 

25

standard that has sometimes been applied to campaign

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contribution limitations.  That standard does not apply 

2

for several reasons. 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Pincus, whatever the 

4

standard, suppose the Florida rule was simply no 

5

facetoface solicitations.  That's it. 

6

 Would you concede that that would be a valid 

7

regulation or would that fall under the First Amendment 

8

as well? 

9

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, I certainly would concede 

10

it in this case, Your Honor, because my client did not 

11

engage in any facetoface solicitation.  So that would 

12

eliminate the sanctions against her. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I want to understand your 

14

view of the scope of the First Amendment in relation to 

15

the selection of  the election of judges. 

16

 MR. PINCUS: 

I think a state could adopt a 

17

prophylactic rule prohibiting facetoface solicitation, 

18

certainly oneonone solicitation and perhaps as some 

19

states have done solicitations in larger groups. 

20

 There might be some applications of that 

21

rule that were  that made that rule invalid as 

22

applied, for example, a facetoface solicitation of 

23

one's relatives that have nothing to do with the 

24

judicial system in the state at issue.  But I think the 

25

First Amendment would certainly allow the adoption of

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that sort of rule. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the First Amendment 

3

would not allow that for the candidate for political 

4

office. 

5

 MR. PINCUS: 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Exactly. 
So you are making it 

7

you are recognizing that there's a difference between 

8

judicial office  that the First Amendment allows the 

9

State to do things with respect to the election of 

10

judges that it wouldn't allow them to do with respect to 

11

the election of members of the legislature. 

12

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, I guess I would amend my 

13

answer to say that  that the First Amendment might 

14

allow a ban on some solicitations on a coercion theory. 

15

Let me step back.  There are three government interests 

16

that have been advanced in this case to justify the 

17

rule. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yeah, but I just asked 

19

you 

20

that that answer was ill considered?  That is, a ban on 

21

facetoface solicitation by candidates for judicial 

22

office, good or not?  And it  would it be judged by 

23

the same standard as a ban on facetoface solicitation 

24

by political  candidates 

25

you gave me an answer and now are you telling me 

 MR. PINCUS: 

I think it would be judged by

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the same strict scrutiny standard, but I think the 

2

interests that the government could advance in support 

3

of that restriction in the judicial context, one of them 

4

doesn't exist in the legislative context, the interest 

5

in preventing bias or in preserving impartiality.  And 

6

one, the interest in preventing coercion of the person 

7

solicited, I think, applies somewhat differently in the 

8

legislative context than it does in the judicial 

9

context.  So I don't want to say that there's no ban on 

10

solicitation that would be permissible in the 

11

nonjudicial context.  There is a federal statute that 

12

bans Congress from soliciting  members of Congress 

13

from soliciting Federal employees, for example. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But if you had the statute 

15

that you say would be valid barring facetoface 

16

discrimination, then you have all sorts of gradations. 

17

What about a personal oneonone letter?  How is that 

18

different?  I can just see the Court having to say, 

19

well, this is what, I guess, under  underinclusive. 

20

And then if we say, well, the oneonone letter, that's 

21

almost like a personal solicitation, we can ban that, 

22

then what about a letter to five people?  And then we're 

23

off to the races. 

24

 MR. PINCUS: 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I think 
It seems to me when you

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

make the initial concession, you have a real problem in 

2

determining how to make this not over or 

3

underinclusive. 

4

 MR. PINCUS: 

I don't think so, Justice 

5

Kennedy.  I think the Court, in other contexts, has 

6

certainly drawn a line between written communications 

7

and oral communications.  In the lawyer solicitation 

8

context, for example, the Court has drawn that 

9

distinction.  So I think there is a reasonable 

10

distinction that it says whatever the rule might be, 

11

written communications are fundamentally different if 

12

the interest that the government is asserting is 

13

coercion.  And I 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, which is it? 

15

You know, if we meet somewhere and I take out a tablet 

16

and write something down and hand it to you.  Is that 

17

written or oral?  It's at least not oral. 

18
19

 MR. PINCUS: 

I guess I would say "in 

person," Your Honor. 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

 MR. PINCUS: 

In person. 

I think the question here 

22

again, just to back up for a minute, is in  I think in 

23

all of the contexts that we're talking about here, the 

24

interest is whether the person solicited is being 

25

coerced.

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MR. PINCUS: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Back all the way up 
Sure. 
 and give us the three 

4

interests that you started off saying were at issue 

5

here.  You never did get to that, did you? 

6

 MR. PINCUS: 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 MR. PINCUS: 

I didn't, sorry, Your Honor. 
Oh, it's your fault. 

There are three interests. 

10

One, the interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption. 

11

One, the interest in promoting impartiality/preventing 

12

bias.  And third, the interest in protecting persons 

13

solicited against coercion. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

judicial dignity? 

16

 MR. PINCUS: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about the interest in 

Well, that 
I mean, there's stuff we 

18

don't let judges do that we let other people do.  Such 

19

as, it's at least a tradition  I'm not sure whether 

20

it's in any ethical rules, but let's assume it was in 

21

ethical rules  that judges do not respond in op ed 

22

pieces to criticisms of their decisions.  All right. 

23

John Marshall did that but he did it anonymously. 

24

 (Laughter.) 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Let's assume that that rule

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

is written into judicial ethics.  Would that stand? 
 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, I  I think there is 

3

such an interest, we acknowledge that in our brief.  I'm 

4

not sure  I don't believe that it suffices to support 

5

the prohibition here for several reasons.  First of 

6

all 

7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, no, but answer my 

question.  Would that be okay? 
 MR. PINCUS: 

Would it be okay to 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

An interest in judicial 

11

dignity.  There are certain things that are infra 

12

dignitatem, as we say. 

13

 MR. PINCUS: 

I think there is such an 

14

interest, and I think it's executed principally through 

15

the acts of judges as judges and maybe is best analyzed 

16

under the government employee free speech rubric.  So it 

17

doesn't necessarily have to reach a compelling interest 

18

in order for it to justify some restrictions on the 

19

judge's speech. 

20

 I think, in this context, to the extent that 

21

that interest doesn't apply for several reasons  first 

22

of all, we're talking about the campaign context, which 

23

is different.  Second of all, to the extent the interest 

24

would apply, here a fundamental principle of  of 

25

Florida's regulatory scheme is that judges may write

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thank you notes for contributions.  So they can say, 

2

thank you, but they can't say thank you 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So if Florida law didn't 

4

let them do that  what I'm trying to find out is if 

5

you think you can have different rules for judicial 

6

elections than you can have for political elections.  I 

7

mean, we're told by the Florida judges who filed a 

8

brief, that they had a horrendous problem with 

9

corruption and they wanted to get a handle on it.  So 

10

they made this small step. 

11

 MR. PINCUS: 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

13

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well 
And they 
To answer your question, 

14

Justice Ginsburg, yes, there can be different rules. 

15

Because two of the interests that I mentioned, the 

16

interest in preventing impartiality and the interest in 

17

preventing coercion, apply differently in the judicial 

18

context.  So I do think that in your hypothetical could 

19

Florida prohibit inperson, onetoone solicitations or 

20

inperson solicitations to a group of some size as 

21

states have done, yes, I think they could do that and I 

22

don't think that could be done for legislative or 

23

executive branch candidates. 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

Suppose a state's view is 

we want the  our judiciary to be above the political

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fray so we have this kind of restriction on putting 

2

themselves forward as  as the solicitor. 

3

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, a couple of answers, Your 

4

Honor.  I think the problem with a state having that 

5

interest is the state has adopted an election system 

6

that puts judges in the political fray.  So as the Court 

7

said in its opinion in White, some things necessarily 

8

come with the fact that a state has made the choice to 

9

choose judges via election and that includes the fact of 

10

an election and some First Amendment requirements that 

11

apply to electionrelated speech.  So I think that's the 

12

problem with making that decision. 

13

 A second problem is the particular scheme 

14

that Florida has adopted here, which as I said, does 

15

allow the judge involvement in the contribution system. 

16

The judge can know who solicited, can know who gives and 

17

can write thank you notes.  So once Florida makes those 

18

decisions, the decision to prohibit 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, how can the judge 

20

not know?  Especially if some states want disclosure, is 

21

the judge supposed to not read the disclosure list? 

22

Everybody else does, he doesn't? 

23

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, there are some states 

24

that prohibit the judge from finding out who  who 

25

knows; Minnesota, for example, has that prohibition.

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, that  it seems 

that  that's just unworkable. 
 MR. PINCUS: 

I think there's a question 

4

about how effective it is, but I do think that 

5

undermine  underlies what's really going on here. 

6

That any incremental benefit that is served by a 

7

prohibition on solicitation, given the reality that the 

8

judge knows and especially given the fact that the judge 

9

can write a thank you note 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you're suggesting that 

11

there could be a mass mailing, but the judge somehow 

12

could be prevented from knowing who responded? 

13
14
15

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, that is the rule in some 

states and I don't 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I'm asking you whether or 

16

not that is consistent with your theory of where we can 

17

draw the constitutional line. 

18

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, I don't  I think the 

19

Court could conclude, as  as the Eighth Circuit did, 

20

that in Minnesota, a state like that, where the judge 

21

doesn't know, there is even less of a  of a reason to 

22

prohibit solicitations because the judge isn't going to 

23

know who responded. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Good, honest, Midwestern 

state, they're not going to tell it.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can I go back to 

judicial dignity coercion. 

3

 It's very, very, very rare that either by 

4

letter or by personal call that I ask a lawyer to do 

5

something, whether it's serve on a committee, help 

6

organize something, do whatever it is that I'm asking, 

7

that that lawyer will say no.  Isn't it inherent in the 

8

lawyerjudge context that people are going to say yes. 

9

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, two, I don't think so, 

10

Your Honor.  In this  in this solicitation, although 

11

Petitioner was a candidate, there  there was no 

12

response. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 MR. PINCUS: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

 MR. PINCUS: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I 
But I  I think 
Because she was unknown. 
 even when she 
But I'm talking about 

18

this  this is  this prohibition is dealing with an 

19

issue that does happen in the vast majority of cases. 

20

 MR. PINCUS: 

I guess, here's the contrast, 

21

Your Honor, if I may.  I guess the question is what's 

22

the difference between that letter and the following 

23

letter that's signed by the members of the committee, 

24

which is totally permissible under Florida law:  Dear 

25

Joe, As an attorney frequently appearing before the

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

county court, we're sure you're concerned with the 

2

quality of the judiciary.  Judge Jones personally asked 

3

us to serve on his campaign committee, and we're writing 

4

to ask you to contribute to his reelection.  As you 

5

know, Florida law permits Judge Jones to thank 

6

contributors. 

7

 I think once all those things are 

8

permissible, who makes the solicitation really doesn't 

9

make that much of an incremental difference 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

 MR. PINCUS: 

12
13

Well 
 in an area where we're 

talking to about compelling interest. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 that's  that's what 

14

you think, but I can actually see how receiving a signed 

15

letter from the judge saying, give, and  or a 

16

telephone call or a personal meeting has an 

17

incrementally greater impact than a letter.  I get 

18

even today I get a whole lot of campaign committee 

19

letters, and I just throw them out. 

20

 If  if a candidate calls me or reaches out 

21

to me, I tell them I can't talk to them and I can't 

22

give, okay, but I have a reason and an excuse.  A lawyer 

23

doesn't have that reason or excuse. 

24
25

 MR. PINCUS: 

And I think that's why, at 

least one line that  that I think is permissible in my

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

response to Justice Ginsburg is a line between written 

2

communications and oral communications, either 

3

onetoone or inperson communications onetoone in a 

4

small group.  I think the coercive effect, to the extent 

5

there is one, is clearly greater there. 

6

 And the question in  in the First 

7

Amendment context where we're talking about core 

8

critical speech where the Court recognized, both in the 

9

charitable contribution cases in Schaumburg and Riley, 

10

as well as in McConnell, that it  it is the 

11

intertwining of substantive messages and requests for 

12

contributions that make both effective.  Where you're 

13

severing that, there has to be a really good reason. 

14

And in the written communication context at least, we 

15

submit, as Judge Sutton for the Sixth Circuit, and as 

16

the Eleventh Circuit and as the Ninth Circuit have 

17

found, there isn't enough there. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is there anything in  in 

19

the Florida rules  I couldn't find it  that would 

20

prohibit Judge Jones in your example from giving the 

21

committee a list of people to contact? 

22

 MR. PINCUS: 

I  there is a rule that says 

23

that judges can't  or candidates can't do indirectly 

24

what they do directly.  And I frankly don't know whether 

25

the Florida bar would interpret the giving of a list

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

to  to circumvent that rule. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But your problem 

3

problem, in a way to decide this, and it's a sort of 

4

joke but it's so true in the experience of the court of 

5

appeals that I had, my brother in the district court, 

6

district court judges I know, in State and Federal 

7

systems, that the normal response to a lawyer  by a 

8

lawyer to a judge in any minor request or, you know, 

9

something normal, the answer is yes.  That's until they 

10

get out the door.  I don't know what they say when they 

11

get out the door. 

12

 But that is such a common experience, that 

13

when the judge says, can you please  yes.  That's the 

14

answer.  And you have to learn how to interpret when 

15

they really want to do no.  And  and that's  that's 

16

almost universal.  And I thought that's why they're 

17

they're writing the rule the way they do.  When it says, 

18

I ask for your support, an early contribution of 25, 50, 

19

100, 250 or 500 made payable to me or the campaign will 

20

help, sincerely  sign my name. 

21

 That's  that's  the answer to that 

22

question is yes.  And if it's the campaign manager, 

23

perhaps it's no.  I mean, I don't know how to go beyond 

24

that, and that's such instinctive and intuitive that I 

25

don't know  I'm asking it because I want it raised to

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the surface and  and I want to see what there is to 

2

say.  You can tell me just ignore it, but I want you to 

3

know it's there. 

4

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, I  I think, a couple of 

5

things, Your Honor.  I think, first of all, there is 

6

not  I think you have to compare that letter to the 

7

to the text that I read, and it seems to me, the fact 

8

that the candidate's or the judge's best friend is the 

9

chairman of his committee, the full committee 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, that's if you're maybe 

11

you're looking for something  when  when somebody 

12

else writes the letter, somebody else makes the request. 

13

 MR. PINCUS: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

15
16
17

But 

my instinct is it's not the same thing. 
 MR. PINCUS: 

But they're making the request 

on the behalf of the judge. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19

 MR. PINCUS: 

20

This is so instinctive but 

Right. 
I think that's the critical 

factor 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So why is 
I mean, it doesn't  it 

23

doesn't just go to a lawyer either.  The  the 

24

limitation is not solicitation of lawyers, is it? 

25

 MR. PINCUS: 

It is 

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's anybody, which really 

2

makes me think that it has more to do with judicial 

3

dignity than  than the corruption stuff we've been 

4

talking about.  You can't solicit anybody. 

5
6
7

 MR. PINCUS: 

Absolutely, Your Honor.  And 

I  and I think that's one of the problems. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Isn't the proof of the 

8

pudding in what Justice Breyer is saying in the 

9

statistics?  One of the briefs mentioned that those 

10

candidates who can fundraise personally do appreciably 

11

better in collecting money than the candidates who have 

12

to go through a committee.  So what would be the 

13

difference, other than the fact that there is some form 

14

of personal coercion in the presence of the judge asking 

15

for the money? 

16

 MR. PINCUS: 

I don't think so, Your Honor. 

17

I think the difference can  can  I mean, obviously I 

18

don't know about where the statistics come from, but 

19

even assuming that the statistics are right, it seems to 

20

me in a system where we vote for a person, a message 

21

from that person that combines what they stand for with 

22

the request for a contribution makes that request for a 

23

contribution more effective, not because it's coercive, 

24

but because it's tied to what the person stands for, and 

25

those parts of the message are effective when they come

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

from the person themselves. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think  I think you'd 

3

find the same statistics true with respect to political 

4

candidates, that they do much better when they  when 

5

they put the arm on you personally, rather than having 

6

somebody else contact you.  I can't imagine that'd be 

7

any different. 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that's the point, 

isn't it? 
 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, I think it's only the 

point to 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

 MR. PINCUS: 

When you put the arm 
I'm sorry.  I think it's only 

14

the point if that arises from coercion.  And as I just 

15

said, I'm not sure that that's right.  I think we don't 

16

know. 

17

 We also don't know whether those statistics 

18

involve States that permit onetoone, inperson 

19

solicitation, which obviously is quite different from 

20

the sending of a letter.  And in those States  and 

21

there are ten of them  obviously those  that is 

22

fully equivalent to the solicitation process in  in a 

23

legislative or executive race. 

24
25

 So I think we don't quite know, but I think 
it would be drawing the wrong conclusion to say the only

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

possible explanation is coercion.  I think there are a 

2

number of other more likely explanations. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Pincus, I take it it 

4

follows a fortiori, from what you're saying, that the 

5

Federal canon that applies to us is unconstitutional, at 

6

least as respects to written communications, so we're 

7

not allowed to put our name on fundraising materials 

8

and things like that.  I take it you're saying that, 

9

too, that's got to go as well; is that right? 

10

 MR. PINCUS: 

No, I don't think so, Your 

11

Honor.  As I  as I said in responding to  to Justice 

12

Scalia, I think the leeway that the Federal government 

13

and the States have to regulate the judges and other 

14

employees because of inconsistency with their duties 

15

this Court has said is much broader than it is and 

16

meets  does not have to satisfy the compelling 

17

interest test as this particular restriction does.  So I 

18

don't think it at all follows. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm sorry, I really didn't 

20

get that.  Why does it not  why is  why  why is 

21

the restriction on us constitutional whereas 

22

 MR. PINCUS: 

You're Federal employees. 

23

You're government employees.  And so the Court has said 

24

in Pickering and other cases that the government, 

25

whoever the responsible rulemaking authority is, has

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

much more authority to regulate the speech activities of 

2

government employees. 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So Florida could regulate 

4

the already elected judge when he's running for 

5

reelection? 

6

 MR. PINCUS: 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, I think 
And he could say, we have 

8

a rule:  Judges don't solicit, period, for charities, 

9

for themselves.  So we have a judge; he's a State 

10

employee.  I take it from your answer and in applying 

11

Pickering to a government employee that the sitting judge 

12

can be restricted. 

13

 MR. PINCUS: 

No, I don't think so, Your 

14

Honor, because I think this is speech in a different 

15

category any  any more than the government can say, 

16

we're going to use Pickering to respect the solicitation 

17

speech of a sitting congressman or State legislature. 

18

 I think it is the election context and the 

19

fact that the State has chosen to choose its judges via 

20

election that triggers the protections 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, you know, I would 

22

think  I would think it's  it's just the opposite, 

23

right, that in a case for Federal judges  like you 

24

say, there's not really much of an interest.  Who cares 

25

whether I solicit funds on behalf of my old law school.

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It doesn't have anything to do with what rulings I'm 

2

going to issue, who I'm going to favor, who I'm not 

3

going to favor. 

4

 In this case, the State can really come in 

5

and say, you know, the things that we're objecting to, 

6

the solicitations that we're preventing are exactly the 

7

ones that are going to go to whether this judge can be 

8

an impartial judge rendering fair verdicts. 

9

 MR. PINCUS: 

I think that's wrong on two 

10

counts, Your Honor.  I think there is  again, where 

11

the judge can know who contributed and can write a thank 

12

you note, the idea that prohibiting the judge to asking 

13

contributes in any way 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

15
16

Well, you're  I'm sorry. 

Please. 
 MR. PINCUS: 

I'm sorry  contributes in any 

17

way to the protection of that interest seems 

18

inconceivable if the question is, is there bias? 

19

 What Florida has basically made  made a 

20

basic determination that a thousand dollar campaign 

21

contribution limit is going to protect our interests 

22

against bias. 

23

 And so the question, then, is: 

Are any of 

24

these other activities going to create such an 

25

appearance?

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And where the State has said a thank you 

2

note, which seems more 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  You keep on going back 

4

on that.  But, I mean, do you think it would be 

5

allowable for the State to say, no, that even the 

6

chairman can't  can't make those solicitations?  So 

7

you keep on falling back, well, they allowed the 

8

chairman or they allowed the thank you notes. 

9

 So now let's say, you know, the State says, 

10

look, we've been trying to do this because we've been 

11

trying to narrow the law in order to accommodate First 

12

Amendment interests; but if you're going to throw that 

13

back in our face, we'll apply it to the campaign chair, 

14

too.  We'll apply it to thank you notes, too.  Those 

15

will also be impermissible. 

16

 Would that be constitutional? 

17

 MR. PINCUS: 

I think if the State wanted to 

18

adopt a system of public financing for judicial 

19

candidates, that it might well then be constitutional 

20

for the State to ban solicitations on the McConnell 

21

theory. 

22
23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What about the answer to 

Justice Kagan's question? 

24

 Is it, oh, well 

25

 MR. PINCUS: 

I don't think 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Oh, well, I'm not going to 

2

answer that question because we  we can think about 

3

something else? 

4

 MR. PINCUS: 

I think the answer to that 

5

question is no, because the contributions are still 

6

permissible.  And the line that the Court drew in 

7

McConnell, in terms of solicitation limitations, was 

8

it's quite permissible to ban candidates from soliciting 

9

contributions that cannot lawfully be made to their 

10

committees when there are other avenues  when they can 

11

still solicit contributions for their committees. 

12

 I think it would be quite a different 

13

situation to say, yes, we're going to have an election, 

14

but no one can solicit any money for the campaign 

15

committee because, as the Court has said, money is  is 

16

essential to get the candidate's message out. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The whole  but the 

18

whole effort on Florida's part is to make the selection 

19

of judges not like the political context. 

20

 And you  what you're saying is that 

21

they  if they choose to elect their judges, they can 

22

do it only one way and the same rules apply to the 

23

judges that apply to candidates for the State 

24

legislature. 

25

 MR. PINCUS: 

Well, respectfully, Your Honor,

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I don't  I don't think so.  I think there are two 

2

distinctions.  One is, I do think once Florida says 

3

thank you notes are okay, it can't ban solicitations. 

4

There might  it might have a better case to justify 

5

its State interest if it didn't do that. 

6

 And I do think, as I said, the coercion 

7

rationale applies differently with respect to judges and 

8

would  would permit limitations that don't apply. 

9
10

 If I may, Mr. Justice, I'd like to reserve 
the balance of my time. 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

 Mr. Richard. 

13

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY RICHARD 

14
15
16
17

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. RICHARD: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 I'd like to begin by responding to Justice 

18

Alito's question.  The answer is that there's nothing in 

19

Florida law or in the canons that prohibits a candidate 

20

from giving names to the committee for the purpose of 

21

the committee soliciting from those individuals. 

22

 What the Florida canon is designed to do is 

23

something that this Court has recognized previously in 

24

Buckley and McConnell, which is to cut the direct link 

25

that creates the quid pro quo relationship by keeping

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the judge from communicating, with the judicial 

2

candidate from communicating directly with the person 

3

that he or she desires to receive the funds  from. 

4
5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
note. 

6

 MR. RICHARD: 

7

think that what we're 

8
9
10
11

Unless it's a thank you 

That's correct, Your Honor.  I 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, once you say you 

can send a thank you note, what  what you've just said 
is not true. 
 MR. RICHARD: 

Well, if  if what we focus 

12

on, which is what my colleague and opposing counsel 

13

focused on, is the intimidation issue, I agree with you. 

14

Either the intimidation issue or the effort to curry 

15

to  to say you've curried favor, I agree with that. 

16

But there's another factor here that this Court has 

17

recognized is almost equally, if not equally important, 

18

which is the appearance of the quid pro quo and the 

19

appearance of corrupt influence that is inherent in the 

20

quid pro quo that the  that results in a public loss 

21

of confidence in the judicial system. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but there's 

23

not always such an appearance.  What if a judge calls, 

24

you know, a college classmate, says, you know, believe 

25

it or not I'm a judge and  and I'm running for

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

election.  Could you give me some money?  Direct 

2

direct in person  or direct solicitation.  But nobody 

3

would say there's any real risk of corruption because 

4

he's calling up his old friends, let's say, who's not 

5

they're not lawyers. 

6

 MR. RICHARD: 

I think, Your Honor, that what 

7

we deal with here, in response to your question, is 

8

similar in kind to this issue of how many people are 

9

being addressed. 

10

 This Court has said that in circumstances 

11

like this, the Court has no scalpel, to use its words, 

12

as to where to draw the line.  The question is what's 

13

judicially manageable? 

14

 And so the question then becomes where 

15

there's going to be a line drawn, is it unreasonable for 

16

the State to say, we're just going to prohibit it, we're 

17

not going to try to micromanage who it is 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, there's a 

19

difference between micromanaging and overinclusiveness 

20

or underinclusiveness.  I mean, could  this could be 

21

easily limited to litigants or lawyers appearing before 

22

the Court. 

23

 MR. RICHARD: 

It could be, Your Honor.  But 

24

then the question is what the appearance to the public 

25

is; and the second question is, because it's always a

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question in First Amendment cases, how does this weigh 

2

against the imposition on the candidate's First 

3

Amendment rights? 

4

 This Court has recognized  it did in  in 

5

both Buckley and McConnell  that one of the reasons 

6

that it upheld it and one of the reasons that it applied 

7

a lesser  a lesser standard of review was because it 

8

said that the imposition on  on the  on the 

9

communicative value of the contributions was marginal. 

10

 In this case, it's even more marginal. 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I  be careful 

12

with that line because there's a number of Justices on 

13

the Court that dissented from that 

14

 MR. RICHARD: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

 MR. RICHARD: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20

 and Citizens United 

has brought that into question. 

17

19

I ­ I 

I  I 
So assuming that's not 

the argument, what's the better response? 
 MR. RICHARD: 

No, I understand.  I 

21

understand, Your Honor.  Perhaps it was  it was not 

22

the best way to lead into it.  But my point here 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you only need five 

votes, and there were five votes there. 
 (Laughter.)

28

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MR. RICHARD: 

Don't be too intimidated. 
I'm getting to try to get your 

3

vote as well, Justice Scalia.  I haven't reached that 

4

point yet.  But  and I understand it's a high mountain 

5

to climb, but  but the point here that I'm trying to 

6

make is that this is an extremely minimal imposition of 

7

the candidate's freedom of expression, if there's any 

8

imposition at all. 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Could they  could 

10

Florida apply this canon to candidates for political 

11

office? 

12

 MR. RICHARD: 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You're saying could it? 
Yes.  If Florida says, we 

14

think it's such a good idea for the judges, we want to 

15

make it across the board, no candidate for political 

16

office can make a direct appeal for money. 

17

 MR. RICHARD: 

I think it would be far more 

18

difficult to convince the Court that that would be 

19

constitutional, and here's the reason:  It's because of 

20

what Justice Kennedy has recognized as what he coined 

21

the  the good responsiveness and the bad 

22

responsiveness. 

23

 In a democratic society, in a republican 

24

form of government, candidates in the other two branches 

25

are expected to commit themselves in advance to certain

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

positions and are expected to comply with that once 

2

they're elected in order to do what their supporters 

3

expected them to do when they supported them with 

4

financial contributions and otherwise. 

5

 When we're talking about judges, there is no 

6

good responsiveness to a supporter or a contributor. 

7

Judges are expected to be impartial, regardless of 

8

whether or not 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Really?  A judge  a judge 

10

can't campaign, you know, I'm going to be tough on 

11

crime? 

12

 MR. RICHARD: 

13

issue, Your Honor. 

That's a  that's a different 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

responsiveness, I thought. 

16

 MR. RICHARD: 

Why?  That's good 

Well, I think that's 

17

responsiveness to an issue; and I think the judges do 

18

have preconceived positions, but not responsive to an 

19

individual. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

 MR. RICHARD: 

22

it's a big difference. 

23

Ah, okay. 
That's the difference, and 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is there really a 

24

the prospect of the appearance of partiality if you have 

25

a radio ad that  with the judge and says, you know,

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these  this is my philosophy, please send me a 

2

contribution?  Is anybody going to think, oh, that judge 

3

is not  is going to be partial to one side or another? 

4
5

 MR. RICHARD: 

Well, I  I think that two 

things are occurring there. 

6

 The answer to your question is, I don't  I 

7

can't presuppose who's going to think he's partial, who 

8

isn't.  I understand your point, Your Honor.  I think 

9

certainly, you don't think that he's partial to a given 

10

individual at that stage, but that solicitation is a 

11

solicitation of a quid. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: Well, go back for a second, to 

13

me, because I actually think judges should try to keep 

14

their preconceptions under control and decide the 

15

individual case.  And I think that is a widely shared 

16

perception and I think that Florida has every right to 

17

say we want to further that. 

18

 But what is your distinction between what I 

19

took as an important argument on the other side, and 

20

maybe you've said it already but I want to hear it 

21

again.  Florida lets judges write thankyou notes for 

22

contributions so there is direct contact and the person 

23

who has given the money knows that the judge knows that 

24

he gave it. 

25

 MR. RICHARD: 

That's right.

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right?  What's the 

2

difference between that and this rule, which says that 

3

the judge cannot write to that individual in the first 

4

place asking for the money. 

5
6
7
8
9
10

 MR. RICHARD: 

I have several answers to 

that, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

One  just one would be 

enough, but I want to know what they are. 
 MR. RICHARD: I understand, but I want to use 
every weapon I have in my arsenal. 

11

 So the first answer is that at the time that 

12

the money is being solicited the contributor, if it is 

13

solicited through a third person, doesn't know whether 

14

the judge will ever find out.  He can find out, but the 

15

person making the contribution doesn't know whether the 

16

judge will ever find out, whether he's ever going to 

17

receive a thankyou note or not.  He just doesn't 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And is it unlawful under 

19

Florida law to put in a letter written by the campaign 

20

manager "and I will tell the judge"? 

21

 MR. RICHARD: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

To say what?  I'm sorry. 
"And I will tell the 

judge." 

24

 MR. RICHARD: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's not unlawful 
All right.  Very well,

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then, he might know. 

2

 MR. RICHARD: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4

But there is a difference 
All right.  So what's the 

second one? 

5

 MR. RICHARD: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

My second argument? 
What  my 
I want to know what the 

8

differences are, which is a main point that was argued 

9

that once you say they can write a thankyou note, and 

10

indeed, as you've added, in the initial letter you can 

11

say, "and I will tell the judge"?  Once Florida permits 

12

those things, what is it that Florida's current 7C 

13

interpretation adds to that?  And if it adds nothing of 

14

significance, why is it constitutional?  That's their 

15

whole argument. 

16

 MR. RICHARD: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18
19

Yes. 
I want to hear your 

responses. 
 MR. RICHARD: 

Yes, Your Honor.  That's the 

20

underinclusiveness argument, and my response is that the 

21

underinclusiveness argument has never been applied by 

22

this Court to say that 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

maybe there is no answer. 

25

 MR. RICHARD: 

You know, I would prefer 

Well, I think there is.

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

One answer is to say it 

2

does exactly the same, it adds nothing but you don't 

3

have to deal with every problem.  I've got that answer. 

4

Do you have any answer that says it does add something? 

5

If so, what? 

6

 MR. RICHARD: 

I believe that Florida could 

7

prohibit the thank you note as well, but it doesn't 

8

change the fact  by not prohibiting, it does not 

9

undermine the fact that by telling judges that they 

10

cannot personally, facetoface or by buttonhole or by 

11

telephone call solicit it, that it does reduce 

12

significantly the public's impression of the fact that 

13

there is a quid pro quo. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If you  if you write a 

15

thank you note, you are not a mendicant.  You are not 

16

going around holding your hat out asking people for 

17

money.  But you're not relying on that, are you?  You're 

18

not relying on the judicial dignity 

19

 MR. RICHARD: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I am not. 
 the dignity of the 

21

office that is held or sought?  That  that's  that 

22

has nothing to do with Florida's rule. 

23

 MR. RICHARD: 

I'm not relying on that, Your 

24

Honor,  I believe that if we're talking about 

25

expressive conduct, that it's unlikely that this Court

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would uphold it based upon the dignity of a given judge. 

2

It's possible that if the action rose to the point where 

3

it undermined the public's confidence in the judiciary 

4

as a whole, it might be sustained.  But I agree with you 

5

that if all we're talking about is the dignity of a 

6

judge who is going around with a hat, I think that 

7

probably would not be sufficient for this Court to 

8

uphold it.  But 

9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

First of all 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought the whole idea 

11

of the Florida Supreme Court when they adopted this rule 

12

is just that, that they wanted to put judges above the 

13

political fray, so they didn't want them to seek 

14

contributions.  Call it dignity, call it the integrity 

15

of the judiciary, call it the public shouldn't perceive 

16

of judges as being political officers, so we shouldn't 

17

say an election for a judge is the same thing as an 

18

election to the legislature.  The whole idea is to put 

19

the judiciary in a separate category.  I thought that 

20

was Florida's idea. 

21

 MR. RICHARD: 

Well, I think that's true, 

22

Your Honor.  It's not only Florida's idea.  I think it 

23

clearly reflects the culture of this Nation, because 

24

virtually every State has adopted significantly higher 

25

standards of ethics for their judicial branch than for

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the other two branches.  And I think that goes to 

2

Justice Kennedy's distinction between the good and the 

3

bad responsiveness which is 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5
6

Counsel, I think you 

answered Justice Breyer a little too quickly. 
 If the letter ended with, "I'm going to tell 

7

the judge you gave me money," then there might be a 

8

violation of that other code that doesn't permit a 

9

candidate to do  to try to circumvent the personal 

10

solicitation rule. 

11

 MR. RICHARD: 

12
13

Thank you, Your Honor.  I 

agree with you. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And, number two:  You 

14

had started, I think, in answering the question of the 

15

quid pro quo difference between a thankyou and the 

16

initial ask. 

17

 MR. RICHARD: 

Yes.  And  and of course the 

18

one area where this Court has consistently recognized 

19

that the State can validly regulate contributions and 

20

solicitations is in its effort to break the direct quid 

21

pro quo, the direct communication between the judge 

22

requesting the money  in this case a judge as opposed 

23

to the  even in the other two branches, the Court has 

24

recognized that, but the judge requesting the money 

25

directly from the person who would be contributing.

36

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 And when one envisions what does not exist 

2

in Florida and most States at the current time, which is 

3

a judge being able to pick up the telephone or visit any 

4

lawyer who ever appears before him, or for that matter 

5

any nonlawyer who might end up appearing before him or 

6

before her, and ask for a contribution, and compare that 

7

to a third person saying to a voter or a contributor, 

8

"My friend, Joe Smith, is running for judge and I would 

9

appreciate it if you would give me money," I think it 

10

would be difficult for anyone who has lived in our 

11

society for any significant period of time to say that 

12

it is not a significant difference, and the public 

13

recognizes that.  And the effect of it 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

We have before us a case 

15

involving a particular person.  She did something and 

16

she was disciplined for it.  So don't we have to compare 

17

what she did and some  the thing which is regarded by 

18

the Florida law as being unethical, and what she could 

19

have done, and see whether there  the incremental 

20

difference has any significant relationship to any 

21

interest that this rule is supposed to serve?  Does 

22

it  was there a greater danger of quid pro quo 

23

corruption or the appearance of corruption or bias or 

24

coercion, the difference between what she did and what 

25

she could have done?

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And what she could have done as I understand 

2

your answers is the following:  She could have  a 

3

letter could have been sent by a committee and the 

4

letter could have  could have said that Petitioner 

5

gave us your name and asked us to solicit a contribution 

6

from you, and that's what we're doing.  And the letter 

7

could either say, "and we'll let the judge know if you 

8

gave a contribution" and  or the candidate know, and 

9

she can write you a thankyou note, she will write you a 

10

thankyou note if you contributed.  Or, you speak for 

11

the Florida bar, so you said it would be okay to put 

12

that in the letter, but if that's not, at least you 

13

could put in the letter and under  Florida law the 

14

candidate can see the list of people who contributed. 

15

 So those are the two situations. 

Now why 

16

was there any greater damage done by what she did as 

17

opposed to what you admit she could have done? 

18

 MR. RICHARD: 

Well, I would say the greater 

19

damage again goes to the fact that she is personally and 

20

publicly requesting a quid from people who can be 

21

expected to appear before her.  And it is Florida's 

22

concern over the public's reaction to that, which I 

23

would suggest is a fair concern and this Court has found 

24

in the other two branches is a fair concern over the 

25

public's confidence in the judicial system.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's not just confidence in 

2

the judiciary, is it?  I mean, to ask  for a judge to 

3

ask for a quid puts pressure on people to give it.  And 

4

that is a different evil than their simply knowing what 

5

happens, and I would say probably worse.  To send a 

6

thankyou note is a form of politeness that creates 

7

knowledge, but does not to the same degree put pressure 

8

on the person to contribute. 

9

 Now, is that fair or not fair? 

And don't 

10

just say yes because you think it's on your side, 

11

because I'll have plenty of people pointing out to me 

12

that it isn't necessarily a good argument, if it isn't. 

13

 MR. RICHARD: 

Your Honor, I  I think it is 

14

clearly a good argument because it's difficult for me to 

15

give you another reason because you said it so 

16

eloquently.  But I do believe that there is a 

17

significant difference between a judge requesting 

18

specifically a contribution or later saying thank you 

19

for the contribution. 

20

 Now when you add to it what if the letter 

21

said the judge will know about this later, that murkies 

22

the water a bit, although there's no evidence that's 

23

ever  ever been 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Richard, there is 

something that the other side has said about your

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position and I'd like your answer to it, that is that 

2

what you are advocating will help the people who are 

3

already in the judiciary, the people who have lots of 

4

money so they don't need contributions from others, the 

5

people who will be hurt are like Ms. Yulee, who is 

6

trying for the first time.  In other words, the Florida 

7

bar has set up a system that works in favor of 

8

incumbents, yes, current officeholders and the rich. 

9

 MR. RICHARD: 

I disagree with that, Your 

10

Honor, and I find it curious that the Petitioner would 

11

suggest that if we take the restrictions off of 

12

incumbent judges so that they're now free to call 

13

lawyers who appear before them or litigants who might be 

14

appearing before them and ask for money, that that 

15

wouldn't give the incumbent an enormous advantage over 

16

nonincumbent judges.  It seems to me that it would. 

17

 But we're also dealing here in an area in 

18

which there is no evidence either in the record or in 

19

the literature to suggest that it makes any difference 

20

and also 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I'm sorry, but 

22

you  up to this point you've been saying what a 

23

significant difference it makes whether someone can 

24

solicit in person or not, and that's why you've drawn 

25

the line there.

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 And now you're telling us, well, it doesn't 
make much of a difference at all. 

3

 MR. RICHARD: 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No. 
It seems to me that 

5

it's  it's selfevident, particularly in judicial 

6

races, where that the  prohibiting a form of raising 

7

funds is to the great advantage of the incumbent because 

8

the only way that, in most judicial raises, the judge 

9

incumbents are going to be challenged if you have 

10
11

somebody who can get their own distinct message out. 
 MR. RICHARD: 

Well, I have two responses, 

12

Your Honor, and excuse me if I didn't clearly express 

13

myself in my response to Justice Ginsburg's question. 

14

 But what I'm saying is, clearly, when you 

15

tell an incumbent judge that that judge can personally 

16

solicit money, that's going to give an incumbent judge, 

17

who has far more intimidation power, an advantage over a 

18

nonincumbent.  And as to weighing which is going to 

19

give more or less advantage, it's difficult to answer 

20

that question, and generally this Court doesn't find 

21

itself in the business of equalizing the playing field 

22

in any case.  So I don't know that it makes any 

23

difference. 

24
25

 But the other fact is that we have no 
evidence in this record or in the literature or in the

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case law to suggest that this is a factor.  It  under 

2

any circumstances. 

3

 The other thing I'd like to comment, if I 

4

might go back to the question that Justice Alito asked 

5

me earlier, is I think that there is another linkage 

6

here that's important, which is this:  If you look at 

7

the difference in the impact upon this Petitioner's free 

8

speech between sending a letter to one person or 

9

personally confronting one person and, on the other 

10

hand, sending it to 5 or 10 or 50 people, if it would 

11

even be manageable to make a distinction, it doesn't 

12

move the free speech needle in this case one iota 

13

because there's very little impact upon that candidate's 

14

free speech.  No matter how many people the candidate is 

15

talking to, the candidate can still say anything he or 

16

she wants to about qualifications, about issues, about 

17

cases, about anything he or she wants to.  This Court 

18

said so in White, and the Florida canon doesn't attempt 

19

to put any restriction on it. 

20

 The only thing it says is you can't say to 

21

me, give me money.  And this Court has recognized in 

22

Buckley and in McConnell that the only communicative 

23

value of saying, give me money, is that when you get 

24

money, it enables you to broadcast your message more 

25

widely.  And the Court has said that that only rises to

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

constitutional level when the restriction is go great 

2

that you can't broadcast your message reasonably. 

3

 Here, the committee can raise money, and we 

4

have no evidence, again, in the record, the literature, 

5

the case law, that 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8
9
10

And 
Where did we say that?  I 

don't  I don't know the case that says that 
 MR. RICHARD: 

That says 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That it's only bad if the 

11

restriction is so great that you cannot broadcast your 

12

message reasonably? 

13

 MR. RICHARD: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, that was 
What law?  That's  that's 

15

the only test, you  you can have all sorts of campaign 

16

restrictions so long as they do not prevent and we're 

17

going to sit in judgment about whether they prevent the 

18

candidate from 

19

 MR. RICHARD: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21
22

No, what I referred to 
What  what case are you 

referring to? 
 MR. RICHARD: 

What I referred to, Your 

23

Honor, is the discussion in Buckley and when it said 

24

that  that the restriction on campaign contributions 

25

and the amount of a contribution, that it's  it's

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

communicative value was in the ability to be able to 

2

broadcast the message, and that it only became 

3

constitutionally significant if it was so Draconian that 

4

the person could not raise enough money to reasonably be 

5

able to broadcast the message. 

6

 Now, that's not the wording that the Court 

7

used, but that was the essence of what the Court said. 

8

 My only point here is there's no  nothing 

9

to suggest that Florida  that Canon 7C(1)'s 

10

methodology is such that a candidate cannot raise enough 

11

money to be a viable candidate.  And so what you're left 

12

with is no imposition, appreciably, on a candidate's 

13

expressive ability.  And I think you fairly have to 

14

connect that to what Florida, on the other hand, is 

15

trying to avoid, which is this appearance of the  this 

16

quid pro quo and the appearance of corrupt influence 

17

which is a significant 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All the First Amendment 

19

requires is not that you have unlimited capacity to 

20

speak, but that you  you be able to speak a reasonable 

21

amount.  Is that  that what the First Amendment 

22

demands? 

23
24
25

 MR. RICHARD: 

Well, I think that you be able 

to speak as much as you desire 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

As much as we think is

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

reasonable  we, the judges. 
 MR. RICHARD: 

I  I think that that's more 

3

broadly stated than you, the judges, have said in the 

4

past. 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Broadly stated as you 

stated it, I think. 
 MR. RICHARD: 

No, I think it's as much as 

8

you desire to speak until you reach the level where you 

9

have  you have interfered with another substantial 

10

State interest.  How substantial that has to be depends 

11

upon the standard of review that the Court applies. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I  I still don't 

13

see how that's inconsistent with the rest of your 

14

argument.  What you've been saying before is it's just a 

15

little bit that we prohibit, so don't worry about it. 

16

And  and I mean the  the prohibition was limited to 

17

the important area.  It's facetoface that is 

18

important.  And now you're saying it's no big deal 

19

because they can do all these other things.  How do you 

20

reconcile those two positions? 

21

 MR. RICHARD: 

Well, I'm not saying that it's 

22

no big deal.  I don't think we can ever say that when 

23

we're dealing with free speech. 

24
25

 What I'm saying is that this Court 
historically has weighed the degree of imposition

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

against the substantial interests that the State is 

2

attempting to serve.  In this case the State is serving 

3

an interest that this Court has recognized, at least in 

4

the area of the quid pro quo, that the State that has 

5

not only a substantial 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Where does it come from, 

7

justice shall not be sold nor shall it be denied?  I 

8

mean, that's at least 800 years old.  And if that 

9

defines the role of the judge, which I think it does, 

10

you're saying that it isn't.  It is a  you do look to 

11

the degree to which you are interfering with the free 

12

speech, which is some degree, some, and it's not speech, 

13

it's really how you solicit money; and on the other 

14

side, how that interferes with that basic role of the 

15

judge.  So then is it not relevant? 

16
17
18

 But the interference, even with raising 
money, which is at one degree from speech, is small. 
 MR. RICHARD: 

I believe it is relevant.  I 

19

believe that this Court, in almost all of its major 

20

First Amendment cases, has asked that question. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, 800 years ago, 

22

judges were not elected.  I mean, I appreciate the 

23

challenge you're  you're under.  You're kind of 

24

backing and filling. 

25

 The fundamental choice was made by the State

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

when they said we're going to have judges elected, and I 

2

mean, you're kind of, as I say, you're trying to patch 

3

the problem there. 

4

 But, I mean, you have a situation where the 

5

people in the State have said we're going to have judges 

6

elected and we're going to recognize that you can 

7

contribute to judges because of there are contribution 

8

limits. 

9

 It seems to me you  you're under a great 

10

burden in trying to figure out how you're going to fix 

11

that without contravening the First Amendment. 

12
13
14

 MR. RICHARD: 

It is a great burden, Your 

Honor, and 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why is it a great burden? 

15

Does it change because you elect the judge, that you're 

16

changing the fundamental role of the judge? 

17

 MR. RICHARD: 

I don't mean that it's a 

18

great  a great burden to make that point.  What I mean 

19

is that we have election of judges, which many people 

20

think is a burdensome system for selecting judges for a 

21

lot of reasons. 

22

 But the fact is we have that, and Florida, 

23

under the United States Constitution, is entitled to 

24

have that.  And what's more, in order to change the 

25

Florida Constitution, 60 percent of the voters of

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Florida would have to vote to change it, and a 

2

substantial number of the voters in Florida have voted 

3

to change it unsuccessfully, and so what we're faced 

4

with is we're faced, as we said in the brief, with the 

5

reality that Florida is trying to weigh two fundamental 

6

constitutional interests and find a reasonable 

7

compromise.  One is the interest in free speech.  The 

8

other one is the undeniable interest, because it's 

9

essential to a stable democracy, of having a judiciary 

10

which avoids both the reality and the appearance of 

11

corrupt influence. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If we looked at  if 

13

somebody looked at the contributions to the candidates 

14

in an election for a county court judge in Florida, what 

15

percentage of the contributions would be found to have 

16

come from practicing lawyers within the county who 

17

appear in  who appear before that court. 

18

 MR. RICHARD: 

That's not in the record, Your 

19

Honor.  However, studies have shown, I think, not only 

20

in the county court but in all judicial elections that 

21

the great  the large percentage of the contributions 

22

come from practicing lawyers.  And I think that that's 

23

where judges naturally seek the contributions.  Thank 

24

you Your Honor. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That could be either

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because lawyers expect judges to respond by favoring 

2

their cases or it could be that lawyers care more 

3

 MR. RICHARD: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5
6
7
8
9

I think 
 about who the judges in 

the courts are; isn't that quite natural? 
 MR. RICHARD: 

I think that's true, Your 

Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'd be surprised if the 

statistics were any different, but it doesn't show any 

10

corruption whatever.  It just shows that lawyers want 

11

good judges and care more about it than the average 

12

citizen does. 

13

 MR. RICHARD: 

I think that's absolutely 

14

true, Your Honor.  But I think that what we're concerned 

15

about is the two things that this Court has identified 

16

in the past, which is avoiding the potential for 

17

corruption that the Court has found is inherent in the 

18

quid pro quo relationship; and, as importantly, avoiding 

19

the appearance of corruption that the public sees. 

20

 And if I can address one more thing, Your 

21

Honor, because I am responding to your question, I 

22

understand that Your Honor does not believe that Buckley 

23

was decided correctly and the day may come when Your 

24

Honor persuades this Court to recede from the parts that 

25

are applicable here.  But in the meantime, I think that

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it is reasonable to urge the Court respectfully that the 

2

same rules that apply or at least the minimum degree to 

3

which the Court has applied these rules to the other two 

4

branches, needs to be applied to the judicial branch. 

5

But there's certainly no basis  it would be totally 

6

inappropriate to carve out a right that judges have that 

7

the Court has not accorded to the other two branches, and 

8

that this case is an example of where that consistency is 

9

important. 

10

 Thank you, Your Honor.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 MR. PINCUS: 

16

 I want to start out by pointing out, because 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

17

I think it's important, that all of the examples that my 

18

colleague used about buttonholing people in the hall and 

19

calling people one on one are onetoone, inperson or 

20

inperson over the phone solicitations, not the kind of 

21

written communications that are at issue in this case. 

22

And I think that's because it is very difficult to say 

23

that a written communication fits either of their two 

24

interests, and I think it's important to keep them 

25

separate 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well is it Mr. Pincus? 

2

 Suppose I'm a judge and I say Dear Joe, you've been in 

3

 my courtroom many times and I hope I've always been 

4

 fair and I know you're going to be here some more times 

5

 in the future, and I hope I always will be fair; and 

6

 you know I'm running for judge and I'd really like a 

7

 contribution of a thousand dollars, signed Judge Smith.

8
9

 MR. PINCUS: 

And I think the  the issue, 

 Your Honor, is the campaign committee under Florida law 

10

 can write that exact same letter and can start by 

11

 saying:  Joe, as you know 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

13

 very different letter. 

14

 MR. PINCUS: 

It can't say "I."  It's a 

It can say, I'm writing on 

15

 behalf  I'm one of the people who Judge Smith 

16

 personally selected to solicit funds for his campaign 

17

 and then say the rest.  And I think the  the 

18

 difference in coercion there is really immeasurable and 

19

 doesn't rise to the level of a compelling interest. 

20

 I think it's important to make another 

21

 point, which is my colleague said a reasonable 

22

 compromise and maybe if rational basis applied here, 

23

 this would be a 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

A rational basis but I 

 think until Citizens United in one opinion, which wasn't

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the majority in the more recent case, the Court had 

2

 never used the words "strict scrutiny" in respect to 

3

 campaign contributions periods.  And I don't think it's 

4

 used the words "strict scrutiny" either, ever, in 

5

 respect to First Amendment limitations in respect to 

6

 what judges say.  Am I right about that or wrong?  I'm 

7

 not positive. 

8
9
10

 MR. PINCUS: 

I think it did use "strict 

 scrutiny" in White, Your Honor, and I think that was a 
 case about what judges say. 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

12

 MR. PINCUS: 

In White. 
But it also has used the strict 

13

 scrutiny standard with respect to charitable 

14

 solicitations, and I think it will be an odd state of 

15

 affairs if charitable solicitations got less protection

 protection, I'm sorry. 

21

Did you say that right? 
Yes, that it should get more 

 And just to go back to Justice Breyer, your 

22

 question about coercion, I think it's important to 

23

 separate coercion and quid pro quo because they get 

24

 mixed up.  Quid pro quo and preventing the appearance of 

25

 quid pro quo corruption is an interest the Court has

 found compelling with respect to all elected officials. 
 So I think if you expect  accept my 

3

 colleague's argument that preventing the appearance of 

4

 quid pro quo corruption is sufficient to ban 

5

 solicitation, then there's no reason why Florida 

6

 couldn't say, such a great idea, we're going to apply it 

7

 with respect to legislators I think you  the focus 

8

 here, I think, really ends up being on coercion.

 MR. PINCUS: 

That's not 
Not on the preventing of 

 corruption. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry, your  your 

13

 opposite party did make the point that the legislative 

14

 process presumes influence and presumes coercion, 

15

 putting the arm on people to help you get into office to 

16

 maintain a position that you've promised you'd maintain. 

17

 But that's not the focus of a judicial election.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I want somewhere

I hope you don't want

 someone who keeps to a position merely because you gave

 MR. PINCUS: 

That goes to a different 

 question, Your Honor, I think, which is bias.  And I 

53

 think there's a difference between quid pro quo

2

 corruption, which is a quid pro quo deal, a corrupt 

3

 deal, and judges being unbiased.  So I think my 

4

 colleague refers to quid pro quo corruption because I 

5

 think he wants to use the Court's analysis in McConnell, 

6

 which I think is inapplicable anyway, but I don't think 

7

 it's possible to say that quid pro quo corruption should 

8

 be the basis here.
