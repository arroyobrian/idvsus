ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
When Vicky Crawford reported to city

12

officials that she had been repeatedly harassed by the

13

board's director of employee relations, her conduct was

14

protected by section 704(a) of Title VII.

15

protected first by the first clause of section 704(a),

16

which is known as the opposition clause.

17

clause has three elements that must be proven.

18

of them is at issue here.

19

first a plaintiff will have to prove that the employer

20

acted with a retaliatory motive.

21

statement or conduct must relate to action that was

22

unlawful under Title VII.

23

happened in the past.

24

something that might happen in the future.

25

It is

The opposition
Only one

But just to set the context,

Second, the employee's

It might be something that

It might be a concern about

And third, the conduct must be in the nature
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of opposition, and that's the question in dispute in

2

this particular case.

3

It is our view that the -- it is sufficient

4

to establish that element if a reasonable person would

5

conclude from the employee's statement or conduct that

6

the employee disapproved of or objected to the

7

employment practice in question.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:
client says:

So a co-worker of your

You know, the boss really was guilty of

10

sexual harassment and the co-worker says:

MR. SCHNAPPER:

In fact,

there are cases involving CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if it's just,

sexual harassment is terrible?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

That would be covered.

link, there's no link to the person that the original -

to be directed at a particular event.

What about, violating the

I think if there's no

reference to Title VII that wouldn't suffice.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

But if she said that

6

in response to the remark by the co-worker that she had

7

been subjected to sexual harassment and then the remark

8

was "Violating the law is terrible," that's opposition?

9

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I think a trier of fact

10

could conclude she was referring to what the co-worker

11

had just said.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

person, did that, that's terrible.

14

MR. SCHNAPPER:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

So if Mr. Jones, the

Yes.
That's actionable as

opposition to the practices?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

It is protected.

employer comes in and fires her for having said that.

The case -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Schnapper I was going to say in part

22

it seems to me that in isolation it seems harmless,

23

almost trivial, but the whole point is that the employer

24

doesn't think it is trivial.

25

hypothesis, as a basis to retaliate.

The employer uses it, by

5

1

MR. SCHNAPPER:

2

elements are important.

3

for that -

4

Right.

That's why the

If the employer fires a worker

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that doesn't solve the

5

problem of having too broad an entry into this thing.

6

You get to the jury by just showing that she said "Oh,

7

if he did that, it's terrible," and then it's up to the

8

jury all of a sudden whether that is the reason that the

9

employer fired this person or not.

I mean, that just

10

leaves -- lays the employer open to a lot of jury

11

determinations that he shouldn't be subject to, it seems

12

to me.

13

MR. SCHNAPPER:

With all deference, Your

14

Honor, the plaintiff must have sufficient evidence to

15

get to the jury on all three elements.

16

claims are routinely dismissed on the causation element.

17

There's not usually a dispute about whether the conduct

18

was protected, and this case in that regard is unusual.

19

But the -

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Retaliation

Do you believe, as I

21

understood you to suggest a moment ago, that you could

22

prove causation if the statement "It is terrible" or

23

"Sexual harassment is terrible" had been uttered in

24

effect in the abstract without reference to particular

25

behavior or a charge of particular behavior on the part
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of a co-worker or an employer?

In other words, if A

2

says "Sexual harassment is terrible" and elsewhere in

3

the company sexual harassment is going on and A is then

4

fired, would it be your view that A would at least state

5

a claim if A said, I had expressed disapproval of sexual

6

harassment, it turns out there was sexual harassment

7

being gone -- taking place elsewhere; and I was fired

8

for that reason.

9

would get a harassment case into court?

Would that at least state a claim that

10

MR. SCHNAPPER:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Up What I'm getting at,

12

doesn't the statement "It's terrible" or whatever the

13

opposition may be have to be made in relation to some

14

specific activity?

15
16

MR. SCHNAPPER:

No, Your Honor.

No, Your

Honor.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then what is the limit?

It

18

seems to me you've got a cause of action in effect under

19

the statute that would be virtually unlimited.

20

who thinks sexual harassment is bad and later gets fired

21

can claim retaliation under the statute if it turns out

22

just as a matter of good luck that somebody was being

23

sexually harassed unbeknownst to the speaker.

24
25

MR. SCHNAPPER:
questions.

Let me try to answer them both.

Alderson Reporting Company

With regard

to what would constitute protected activity, it is our

what if the employee goes further and says:

did such and such, but I know he was just kidding; or I

hope you don't take any action against that person.

Would that be opposition?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Not necessarily.

Again, it

2

depends on the question that was asked and the answer

3

that was given.

4

the question was did Mr. Hughes engage in inappropriate

5

activity.

6

could understand that that was a request for a

7

description of something that the witness objected to.

8
9

If I might, for example, in this case

That was a request -- I think a trier of fact

Let me ask this.

believes that the supervisor has engaged in improper

activity.

12

grounds for dismissal or some other sanction.

13

an employee provides information that's exculpatory.

14

Can -- is that protected?

15

16

So what they are trying to do is substantiate

MR. SCHNAPPER:

And then

Is that -- is that

It's our view that that is

17

not protected by the opposition clause.

It is our view

18

it would be protected by the participation clause.

19

If I might get back to the question -

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it strange when there

21

are many situations in which testimony or the reporting

22

of information is protected, but when it's done, isn't

23

it usually done both ways, as it is under the

24

participation clause?

25

cannot be the subject of retaliation or the reporting of

So that the testimony is -

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

information cannot be the subject of retaliation, but

2

not it's protected only if it goes in one direction?

3

Isn't that a very odd approach to that situation?

4

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's why we're advancing

5

the view that the participation clause here provides as

6

well, so that it's clear that exculpatory witnesses are

7

protected.

8

witness would anger someone.

9

It is not unimaginable that an exculpatory

But going back to the question you asked

10

earlier, it's possible that in response to a question an

11

answer might be given which a reasonable person would

12

not conclude reflected disapproval such as, well, he

13

told that joke, and I thought it was funny.

14

And, indeed, in the Harris v. Forklift case

15

there were witnesses like that who -- who confirmed that

16

the owner of Harris Forklift had made the jokes in

17

question but said they didn't mind.

18

be our position at -

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

That that would not

Wouldn't that be very

20

strange?

Suppose that this -- the factual situation

21

actually is very severe and is enough to -- to establish

22

liability on the employer's part, but this particular

23

reporting employee doesn't think so.

24

employer might well be very annoyed that this

25

information which can be the -- the basis for liability
11
Alderson Reporting Company

So then the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has been brought out against the employer, and the

2

employer might want to retaliate.

3

Why would that be unprotected just because

4

this employee adds his or her opinion that it isn't

5

serious?

6
7
8
9

MR. SCHNAPPER:

We think it is protected by

the participation clause.
JUSTICE BREYER:
the EEOC says?

Why don't you follow what

I mean, the EEOC, as I understand it,

10

has said the very fact the employer has initiated an

11

investigation of an alleged discrimination is sufficient

12

to demonstrate the reasonableness of the employee's

13

belief that by providing information relevant to the

14

inquiry she is opposing an employment practice made

15

unlawful by Title VII.

16

And then they go on.

To be absolutely clear

17

about it, they say an employee who assists her or her

18

employer in the endeavor, i.e., you go and testify; so

19

the sun was shining on that day; you are assisting your

20

employee by telling the truth-- is by definition -- is

21

opposing practices made unlawful by Title VII.

22

So here we have a difficult question, quite

23

an interstitial question, defining precisely "opposing,"

24

and here we have the EEOC doing it.

25

just follow what they say?

we get to the same place by a different route.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if -- what if I am

8

indeed very much in favor of sexual harassment?

I am a

9

world class sexual harasser, but I'm also not a liar,

10

and I'm -- I am subpoenaed or called up by the employer

11

in connection with this internal investigation and asked

12

whether so-and-so harassed a particular worker.

13

say, yes, as a matter of fact, he did, and a good thing

14

too.

15

Is that expressing opposition?

16

MR. SCHNAPPER:

17
18
19
20

No.

We believe it is

covered by the participation clause.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I'd

We think -

Covered by the

participation clause?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Because our view is that the

21

employer's internal processes for detecting and rooting

22

out sexual harassment, for example, is a -- is a process

23

-- is a process that's under this title within the

24

meaning of -

JUSTICE BREYER:

everybody in the internal investigation who could be at

sides; anyone who made a charge, testified, assisted, or

22

participated in any manner in the investigation, I

thought that the other side's position was, well, this

elements to an investigation or a proceeding or anything

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

But we do think that at least a reasonable

Facts that would

I think this is where we have

JUSTICE ALITO:

It

Well, I understand that, but

6

I'm -- what I'm asking is, is the reason to doubt

7

whether Congress intended in the opposition clause to

8

provide protection only for people who testify or

9

provide information that goes in a particular direction?

10

MS. BLATT:

I think -

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the purpose is to -- is

12

to elicit information and protect the people who come

forward with the information, then why don't you provide

the protection irrespective of what the person says?

15

MS. BLATT:

I think that position is

16

consistent with the EEOC, and I don't think we would

oppose that position in the sense that it would give the

greatest and broadest protection.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. YOUNG:

quite different meanings.

it and so forth.

And your assertion is that in this

It asks whether you were actively -

Now, once you adopt that position, I don't

see how the fact that you -- that something that was not

active opposition can be converted into active

opposition by something that occurred later.

10

I mean, if you want to abandon your other
argument, that's fine with me, but -

(Laughter.)

12

MR. YOUNG:

with the concept that subsequent -- a subsequent

see that distinction as being relevant.

23

if a subsequent complaint is made a month, two months

24

after the initial disclosing conduct, then we're -- then

25

we're traveling on that subsequent complaint.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Because if -

And the fact that a disclosure was made a

date in terms of when the protections of the statute

4

arise.

5

The -- the -- the concept is something more

6

than disclosure, something more than mere cooperation.

7

The language of the statute is he or she has opposed a

8

specific practice, not just opposition to the war in

9

Iraq in general; not just opposition to sexual

10

harassment in general; but that a specific -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It isn't just a specific -

12

again, if I don't understand your case, it isn't just a

13

matter of the specific practice.

14

Your point is it is not asking your opinion.

15

It is asking whether you are actively trying to

16

eliminate it.

17

I think even if -- if you were asked your

18

opinion, you know, do you -- do you oppose what, you

19

know, what this supervisor did?

20

yes, I don't favor it, I think it's bad, I think it's a

bad idea, I -- as I understand your case, that's not

opposition.

23

MR. YOUNG:

25

And -- and you said

Your Honor And I don't see how that is

changed at all when you put it in the context of a

1

specific act of harassment as opposed to putting it in

2

the context of harassment in general.

3

You -- you -- if you're hiding behind the -

the defenses you've built up, it seems to me those

5

defenses require something more than an expression of

6

your opinion of whether it's good or bad.

7
8
9

Your opinion is whether it's good or bad is
not opposition.
MR. YOUNG:

I agree with that, Your Honor.

10

I used the term "practice" inartfully.

11

there is a specific act that the employee considers to

12

be unlawful, and that's what the employee is opposing.

13

So that is what needs to be communicated to a reasonable

14

person within the government or within -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Our argument is

If the -- if the employee

16

in response to the inquiry that's being made says yes, I

17

saw my employer do "X" and it happened -- and I think

18

it's terrible, that is certainly specific to the act.

19

MR. YOUNG:

It's specific to the act, Your

20

Honor, but I -- I would argue that does not cross the

21

line into "and I oppose it."

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the reason -- but the

23

reason it doesn't cross the line is you are, in effect,

24

saying that "oppose" within the meaning of the statute

25

has got to be read more narrowly than the -- than the
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

notion of oppose as we commonly use that word in common

2

speech.

3

And I don't know why -- I don't know what

4

your -- what your authority is for saying that "oppose"

5

was not used in its commonsense everyday connotation.

6

MR. YOUNG:

Well, I think the word "oppose"

7

can be used in a specific sense in common everyday

8

speech and can be used in a general sense, Your Honor.

9

And I think -

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But in my hypothetical,

11

we're not talking about a general sense.

hypothetical we were talking about a reference to a very

13

specific act.

14

And yet despite the specificity, you say, and despite

the fact that in common speech a -- a specific statement

like that would be taken as opposition, you say it

the context of anti-retaliation provisions, making a

statement to an alleged harasser to stop the harassment

18

or get out of my office does not rise to opposition

19

conduct, because the -- the -- the essence of the

20

opposition clause is somehow putting the employer on

21

notice.

22

If every employee who was a victim of sexual

23

harassment and says stop, if that -- if that constitutes

24

opposition conduct under the retaliation clause,

25

suddenly that employee has two causes of action, one for

These are active verbs.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So why doesn't it fall under

MR. YOUNG:

An -- an employer's internal

after a charge has been filed with the EEOC?
MR. YOUNG:

Well, the five circuits that

22

the trigger that brings the internal investigation under

MR. YOUNG:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And how about taking our

2

decisions in the Faragher and Ellerth case which in a

3

sense made the employer's internal investigation part of

4

the EEO process because it says to the employer, if you

5

don't have that find of effective internal complaint and

6

investigation procedure, then you're going to be stuck

7

on respondeat superior liability.

8

will be shielded.

9

If you do, then you

So this Court's decision in those two cases

10

seemed to me to say to every employer, as part of your

11

EEO compliance you had better have this internal

12

complaint procedure and investigation.

13

MR. YOUNG:

I agree.

Faragher and Ellerth

14

put the carrot on the stick in front of the employers

15

and say, here's an affirmative defense that will be

16

available to you in certain harassment cases if you

17

adopt a -- an anti-harassment policy which includes an

18

investigation mechanism.

19

such a mechanism is not made mandatory by Faragher and

20

Ellerth.

However, such a policy and

The argument of -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you say it's not made

Any employer who doesn't go through it is

23

crazy.

24

in practical terms the requirement that Justice Ginsburg

25

just described, can then say, oh, but we're going to

And I don't see how this Court, having imposed

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

construe this indefinite term of "investigation"

2

to exclude this kind of employer activity which our

3

construction of the statute has virtually mandated.

4

So that if in fact the employer's

5

investigation succeeds in ending the problem and there

6

is no EEOC complaint, those who participated in the

7

investigation are absolutely helpless against

8

retaliation.

9

-- a statute in which we have any -- any opportunity to

That would be a bizarre way to interpret a

10

interpret "investigation" to include this kind of

11

investigation.

12

What do you say to that?

13

MR. YOUNG:

The fact that Faragher and

14

Ellerth create an incentive to employers to develop

15

these policies with investigate -- which include

16

investigations, does not elevate such investigations to

17

fall under the statutory requirement of being -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

But I'm -- I'm giving

19

you an argument as to why we should construe it to

20

elevate it, and -- and the argument is that we, in

21

effect, in what I think were correct decisions -- you

22

agree, you said a moment ago, were correct decisions -

23

have in practical terms mandated this kind of an

24

inquiry.

25

Why then would it be reasonable for us, if
43
Alderson Reporting Company

we have any option in construing the term

investigation and exclude coverage of the people who

7

MR. YOUNG:

Why would that be a reasonable

Because at some point, Your

8

Honor, the construction departs so far from what can

reasonably be supported by the language of the statute

itself that it -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, why isn't it -- why

12

isn't an investigation by the employer an

13

"investigation"?

14

That's the language of the statute.

MR. YOUNG:

It -- it is an "investigation."

15

Our contention is it does not fall under the category of

16

an "investigation" under this title even despite

Faragher and Ellerth.

MR. YOUNG:

Alderson Reporting Company

that's true, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -- well, that's

3

a different question.

4

Ellerth and Faragher in the hostile work environment

5

case or in the specific action case as well?

6

MR. YOUNG:

Is the defense we recognized in

My understanding of Faragher and

7

Ellerth is that it -- it applies in the hostile work

8

environment case involving harassment by a supervisor.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought you were going to

10

answer Justice Souter with the assertion that if indeed

11

the Court wants employers to conduct these

12

investigations, it does not want to reduce the incentive

13

to do so.

14

And the rule that is urged by the other side

15

means whenever the -- whenever the employer conducts

16

such an investigation, any employee who is smart enough

17

to come in and testify against -- against sexual

18

harassment has a guaranteed job.

19

almost like being a Federal judge.

20

[Laughter.]

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is almost like -

You can't be fired after

22

that, or the employer can't fire her without opening

23

himself up to a lawsuit under -- under this provision.

24

And he might win the lawsuit, but it's going to cost

money.

So why -- maybe an employer would rather say,

And instead they would

substitute the -- the response to an EEOC investigation

opposing respondeat superior.

an inducement for them to go ahead with the

investigation; wouldn't you?

17

MR. YOUNG:

I suppose that would be

Their -- they would lose the

18

protections of Faragher and Ellerth.

19

to respondeat superior liability.

20

but I -- I submit to the Court that if -- that if it is

21

going to be a Hobson's choice and it -- it would be a

22

situation in which employers would have an incentive to

23

choose not to -- would choose to abandon their policies

24

and take their chances.

25

We would be back

It sounds illogical,

If they have to interview 20 people in a 46

in a retaliation -- in a sexual harassment case, there's

2

20 potential plaintiffs because they all participated.

3

It doesn't even matter if the employer knows what the

employees said.

5

adverse action is imposed by the employer on any of

6

those employees, there is an instant retaliation claim.

If -- if some type of discipline or

in this case, although this is not the issue before us,

is still your position that ultimately you should win

11

this case, because you have good evidence, you say in

nothing to do with retaliation.

That's true, isn't it?

her subordinates were interviewed and they provided

I said if you have a

really strong case of having discharged this person for

cause that has nothing at all to do with harassment, you

are going to win the lawsuit and it would be hard for

the plaintiff to get a decent lawyer to represent her

side of the case because she's going to lose.

MR. YOUNG:

In theory, yes; but the burdens
