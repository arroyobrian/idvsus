             ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

7

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

            MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9

please the Court:

10

            Under Florida law, Timothy Hurst will go to

11

his death despite the fact that a judge, not a jury,

12

made the factual finding that rendered  rendered him

13

eligible for death.  That violates the Sixth Amendment

14

under Ring.  In Florida, and Florida alone, what

15

authorizes imposition of the death penalty is a finding

16

of fact by the Court of an aggravating factor, a finding

17

that the trial judge makes independently, and, quote,

18

"notwithstanding the jury's recommendation as to

19

sentence."

20

            Now, the State here contends that capital

21

sentencing juries make implicit findings that satisfy

22

the Sixth Amendment under Ring, which the trial judge

23

then simply ratifies.  That is wrong.

24

            Whatever the jury's recommendation might

25

imply about the specified aggravating factors, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

Florida Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected the notion

2

that the jury's verdict is anything other than advisory.

3

Florida law entrusts the factual findings of aggravators

4

to the judge alone, who may do so on the basis of

5

evidence that the jury never heard, and aggravators that

6

the jury was never presented with.

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is there ever a case in

8

which the jury found aggravators and recommended the

9

death sentence, and the judge reversed that finding?

10

            MR. WAXMAN:  There may well be.  This is

11

principally a case about the finding of death

12

eligibility, not sentence selection.  I 

13

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I mean, either 

14

either way, is  is there  is there 

15

            MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:   is there ever a case in

17

which the jury did not find an aggravating circumstance,

18

but the judge did?

19

            MR. WAXMAN:  Well, we don't ever know what

20

the jury found about any of the specified aggravating

21

circumstances.  The only thing that the jury tells the

22

judge is, we recommend lifeslashdeath by a vote of X

23

versus Y.

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.  But they can't

25

recommend death unless they find the aggravator, right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

            MR. WAXMAN:  Well, no.  No.  As a matter of

2

State law, that's not correct.  They can't recommend

3

death unless seven of them each believe that some

4

aggravator is satisfied.

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  All right.

6

            MR. WAXMAN:  But the Florida Supreme

7

Court  and this is a  this is a  another Ring

8

problem here.  The Florida Supreme Court has recognized

9

that where two aggravators are presented, it is

10

impossible to know, even if a simple majority agreed on

11

a single aggravator.

12

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's a

13

common feature, though, of jury deliberations.  Let's

14

say an aggravator is whether the murder is  is

15

particularly heinous.  And it can be for  for a number

16

of factors:  One, the victim is a  a  a juvenile, so

17

maybe three jurors find that.  Or an officer was also

18

killed, or it was in the commission  in the course of

19

another felony.

20

            In a typical case, a finding that the murder

21

was heinous, you have no idea whether the juror  jury

22

as a whole made that determination, or if there were 12

23

different reasons.

24

            MR. WAXMAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, Florida,

25

and  Florida is the only State  the only death

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

penalty State and therefore the only State that does not

2

require or permit the jury to be told that it has to

3

agree.  And in all other States it's unanimous, but even

4

has to  cannot even be told that a majority have to

5

agree as to the existence of one of the specified

6

aggravating factors.

7

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but isn't that

8

true  I mean, taking it even out of the death penalty

9

context, that's true with every jury determination.  You

10

could have the jury determining that the  the 

11

the  you know, the  the person didn't commit the

12

offense because his alibi was good, or because, you

13

know, somebody else did it, or, you know, any number of

14

12 different reasons that they think he was not guilty.

15

It doesn't 

16

            MR. WAXMAN:  It 

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   have to be

18

agreement by the jury on a  on the particular basis

19

for their verdict.

20

            MR. WAXMAN:  We're talking here, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, about elements of the crime.  And as this Court

22

explained in Ring, the existence of a statutory

23

aggravating factor is an element of a deatheligible

24

crime.

25

            And can anybody imagine a world, which would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

be the analogue in Florida, if the jury at the

2

guilt/innocence phase of any trial, a shoplifting trial,

3

were told, now, look.  I'm the one who will decide

4

whether the defendant is or isn't guilty as a matter of

5

law, and  and eligible for punishment.  But I'd like

6

your input on what you  whether you think each of the

7

specified elements is or isn't satisfied.  I mean,

8

that  nobody would stand for an argument like that 

9

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure.  You 

10

you 

11

            MR. WAXMAN:   or a system like that.

12

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Are you sure that  that

13

if you have a crime that can be satisfied by various

14

elements, the jury has to agree upon the specific

15

element that satisfies it?

16

            MR. WAXMAN:  The jury  if they are

17

distinct elements, and this  this implies the Schad

18

point that the State is raising:  If the State,

19

consistent with a long historical tradition and a

20

finding of equal culpability, chooses to permit a

21

particular element in Schad, it was premeditation, or

22

the mental state to be satisfied either by premeditation

23

or by felony murder, that's fine.

24

            But that is not the Florida system.  Florida

25

requires as a matter of law  and the Florida Supreme

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

Court has said this over and over again  that a

2

defendant is eligible for death only if the trial judge

3

finds as fact, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a

4

particular statutory aggravator exists.

5

            And I submit, even if that were not the

6

case, extending Schad, which held that in light of a

7

hundredandfiftyyear history of States including in

8

the mental element for first degree murder, either

9

felony murder or premeditation, that combining those two

10

elements didn't satisfy the death penalty.  None of that

11

is here.

12

            This is a question of the Sixth Amendment

13

and the Eighth Amendment.  No State ever has said that

14

the jury can just decide some model of aggravation.

15

They just  they don't agree on the specific element,

16

and that would violate, I think, the Sixth and Eighth

17

Amendment precedents.

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I  I  I would think

19

that the  I would think just the opposite, that that

20

the necessity of finding the elements of the crime goes

21

all the way back into the mists of history.

22

            And this necessity of finding an

23

aggravator  aggravating factor, we made it up, right?

24

I mean, that's just recent Supreme Court law.

25

            MR. WAXMAN:  Just 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And so if  if even one of

2

them should be satisfiable by simply finding the generic

3

conclusion rather than agreeing upon the  the

4

particular species at issue, I would think it's 

5

it's  it's the latter, rather than the former.

6

            MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia, I'm reminded of

7

your separate opinion  I think it was in Walton v.

8

Arizona  where you were choosing between two things

9

that you didn't particularly like, and one of them was

10

the fact that the Court had made, recently or not, had

11

made a finding of a  beyond a reasonable doubt, a

12

factual finding of a specified aggravating factor an

13

element of the crime.  And whether it's recent, whether

14

the court should or shouldn't have done it, it has.  And

15

it  under Ring, it is just like any other element of

16

the crime.

17

            And on the Schad point, I think the other

18

thing I would have said is, the Florida Supreme Court 

19

and I'll refer the case  the Court to the Bevel

20

case  the Florida Supreme Court has said that the 16

21

aggravating factors that it  that makes one eligible

22

for death are vastly incommensurate, in terms of

23

relative levels of 

24

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Mr. Waxman 

25

            MR. WAXMAN:   moral ability, opposite of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

the predicate of Schad.

2

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I ask you this about

3

Ring?  I wasn't on the Court at the time of Ring, so

4

could you tell me if Ring is entitled to greater weight

5

as a precedent than, let's say, Gregg v. Georgia and the

6

other cases upholding the constitutionality of the death

7

penalty?

8

            MR. WAXMAN:  Oh, I'm not  I  I wouldn't

9

be prepared to say  to assign weight to either of

10

them.

11

            I think Ring is certainly predicated on

12

Gregg, to Justice Scalia's point.  If Gregg hadn't

13

decided that  that there has to be a determinate,

14

specific appellate reviewable narrowing of trial 

15

sentencing jury's discretion, Ring wouldn't come up,

16

because an aggravating factor wouldn't be an element.

17

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think this

18

scheme, assuming we agree with Justice Scalia, that you

19

don't really need unanimity, would this still be good

20

law under Apodaca  Apodaca 

21

            MR. WAXMAN:  Well 

22

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   the case that said

23

that we  we needed a unanimous jury, but, you know,

24

nine out of twelve is okay?  Do you  do you think

25

seven out of five is okay?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

            MR. WAXMAN:  I hope it was clear from our

2

brief that we think 

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not.

4

            MR. WAXMAN:   nine out of five is not

5

okay.  It doesn't require this Court to overrule

6

Apodaca, which 

7

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We're not required to do

8

anything.  We could just say it's not the functional

9

equivalent.  But is 

10

            MR. WAXMAN:  Well 

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But is it still good

12

law?

13

            MR. WAXMAN:  Well, six 

14

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Shouldn't we overrule

15

it?

16

            MR. WAXMAN:  I  we think, for the reasons

17

stated in our brief, you should overrule it.  And

18

particularly in the Eighth Amendment context where the

19

question is death, the jury should be unanimous.

20

            I mean, there is no other State that permits

21

anyone to be sentenced for death other than a unanimous

22

determination by the jury.  And the State of Florida

23

requires unanimity for shoplifting, just not for death.

24

It requires unanimity on all the other elements of the

25

crime.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

            Now, even  Apodaca's is a  is an unusual

2

decision, as Justice 

3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, wait a minute.

4

They  they  they require unanimity for the  for a

5

conviction, right?

6

            MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  And conviction 

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Just  just  just they

8

don't require unanimity on the sentence.  That's quite

9

different from 

10

            MR. WAXMAN:  Justice 

11

            JUSTICE SCALIA:   from whether the person

12

committed the crime or not.

13

            MR. WAXMAN:  Justice Scalia  exactly.

14

And, Justice Scalia, leaving aside our Eighth Amendment

15

point in our brief that  that followed on Justice

16

Breyer's concurrence in Ring, the  this is all about

17

the eligibility, not the determination of what sentence

18

applies.  And you have held that the existence of a

19

specified statutory aggravating factor is a condition.

20

It is an element of capital murder, and it is, by

21

statute and Florida Supreme Court decision, an element

22

of capital murder in Florida.

23

            And in Apodaca itself, which, as  as

24

Justice Thomas pointed out in McDonald, is an

25

extraordinarily unusual case, even there, six justices

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

indicated that a simple majority rule would not pass

2

muster.

3

            I mean, we need to  once a  at 

4

when  when an assignment is made to a jury in a case

5

to decide beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of an

6

element, however the State defines the element, we need

7

substantial reliability that the jury actually performs

8

those functions.

9

            And in this case  and, again, in this

10

case, if it were true that the sentencing jury was

11

actually determining death eligibility, which it is

12

plainly not, as we point out, the Eighth Amendment would

13

certainly be violated under Caldwell, because this 

14

Florida juries are told that they do not determine death

15

eligibility.  And the State simply can't have it both

16

ways.  Either the jury is correctly told that its role

17

is merely advisory, in which case there is a Ring

18

violation, or the instruction that it's given violates

19

the Eighth Amendment under Caldwell, because, as in

20

Caldwell, it misleadingly, quote, "minimizes the jury's

21

sense of responsibility for determining the

22

appropriateness of death."

23

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Waxman, do we  do

24

we just treat as irrelevant what was involved in this

25

case, that is, the two aggravators that were alleged,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

the brutality of the murder, and that it occurred during

2

a robbery?  Those were obvious that they existed.  Is

3

that not so?

4

            MR. WAXMAN:  I think it's not so.  It's

5

probably a reason why  for  I mean, the heinous,

6

atrocious, and cruel aggravator can never be obvious.

7

And the State isn't even arguing harmlessness with

8

respect to that.

9

            And as to robbery, I think it's important

10

to  to recognize the following:  The State made a

11

choice.  They didn't even indite Timothy Hurst for

12

robbery.  The sentencing jury was not even instructed on

13

the elements of robbery.  This argument of harmlessness

14

was never raised in these proceedings from the

15

sentencing proceeding onward, including in the brief in

16

opposition in this case, until the Red brief, and even

17

there the Red brief is simply arguing that there was a

18

fatal concession.

19

            But in any event, Justice Ginsburg, there is

20

evidence in the record from which a jury could certainly

21

find that Timothy Hurst, although he was found guilty of

22

firstdegree murder, did not, in fact, actually commit

23

the robbery.  The jury was told that to find the

24

existence of the felony murder aggravator, it had to

25

find  and I believe this is on Page 211 of the Joint

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

Appendix  that it had to find that the murder was

2

committed while he  in the course of him committing a

3

robbery.  All of the physical evidence in this case that

4

relates to the robbery, the  the  the bank deposit

5

slip, the money, the bank deposit envelope, and a piece

6

of paper in LeeLee Smith's handwriting toting up the

7

proceeds were all found in LeeLee Smith's possession.

8

            And so, although it is not this Court's

9

ordinary function to determine whether something was or

10

wasn't harmless, as in Ring it was remanded for that

11

purpose, I think in this case it manifestly was not

12

harmless.  And if there were a remand or any question by

13

this Court on that count, it ought to be remanded to the

14

State court, not only to determine constitutional

15

harmlessness, but whether there was a waiver by the

16

State in its deliberate choice never to mention this

17

either to the second sentencing jury or thereafter.

18

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Waxman, am  am I

19

understanding the case properly?  The informant, who had

20

all of the physical evidence, was the main identifier of

21

the defendant, correct?

22

            MR. WAXMAN:  Correct.

23

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And 

24

            MR. WAXMAN:  Because there were  there

25

were  there was an eyewitness from across the street

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

who testified that he saw somebody go into the Popeye's,

2

and he positively identified the defendant.

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Now, did 

4

            MR. WAXMAN:  Now, I believe there was

5

another cooperator who backed up LeeLee Smith's

6

testimony.

7

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the defendant

8

claimed, however, that this informant was the one who

9

did the crime.

10

            Could the jury, under the evidence that

11

existed, concluded that they both did it?

12

            MR. WAXMAN:  Certainly.

13

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And that's why it's

14

debatable whether it's harmless?

15

            MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.  And, in fact 

16

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Because what makes it an

17

aggravator is if he's the one who actually did the

18

killing.

19

            MR. WAXMAN:  That's correct.

20

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That he wasn't 

21

            MR. WAXMAN:  Well, that's what the jury was

22

instructed.

23

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Uhhuh.

24

            MR. WAXMAN:  The jury was instructed that in

25

order to find the felony murder aggravator, it had to

Alderson Reporting Company

17
1

find that the murder was committed in the course of him

2

committing the robbery.

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Personally.

4

            MR. WAXMAN:  Yes.

5

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All right.  That's 

6

            MR. WAXMAN:  But the  the statute, the

7

actual aggravator, is different.  But that is what this

8

jury was told.

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Waxman, can  can I

10

give you a  a hypothetical State system?  And this is

11

a twopart question.  You tell me if it is consistent

12

with the Sixth Amendment.  And if it is, what makes this

13

case different.  Okay?

14

            So my system is that a jury, whether in the

15

penalty phase or in the guilt phase, has to make a

16

determination of an aggravating factor.  Okay?  But once

17

that's done, once the jury decides on an aggravating

18

factor, the judge can do whatever she wants.  The judge

19

can add aggravating factors.  The judge can reweigh the

20

aggravating factors as compared with the mitigating

21

evidence.  The judge can do any of that stuff.

22

            But the judge has to leave alone the

23

aggravating factor that the jury finds.  So, in other

24

words, the judge can't give death when the jury finds

25

life, and the judge can't throw out the jury's factor.

Alderson Reporting Company

But  but as long as that jury makes that aggravating

2

factor determination, the judge can do anything.  Is

3

that consistent with the Sixth Amendment?

4

            MR. WAXMAN:  Okay.  You're  you're asking

5

only about the Sixth Amendment and not the Eighth

6

Amendment 

7

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.

8

            MR. WAXMAN:   point.  Okay.  So the  so

9

just to be sure that I'm specifically answering your

10

question, if the jury is told, you must find  for the

11

defendant to be eligible for death, you must find beyond

12

a reasonable doubt the existence of at least one of the

13

statutory aggravating factors.  And I would also say for

14

Sixth Amendment purposes, you must either be unanimous

15

or the vote must be at least ten to two.  And then the

16

jury does so find.  And then you have the sort of

17

beltandsuspenders legal system that the State is

18

positing that Florida has here where the judge can say,

19

okay, I'm the one who does the sentence, so I can weigh

20

the ags and the mits.  I can't  he is death eligible

21

because the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that a

22

statutory aggravator exists.  But the judge can say,

23

nonetheless, I'm giving life.  There's nothing 

24

there's no violation of the Sixth Amendment in  when

25

that happens.

Alderson Reporting Company

19

            The question is, in this case, when the

2

sentencing jury has concluded its work  I mean  and

3

I'm assuming in a case where there's not a conviction

4

for a prior aggravated felony.  When the sentencing jury

5

has concluded its work, is the defendant eligible for

6

the death penalty under State law?  Yes or no.  And in

7

Florida, the answer is unquestionably no.

8

            Even if we knew that 12 of the jurors found

9

the robbery aggravator here, there would be a Ring

10

violation, just as if we knew that 12 of the jurors

11

found that he had killed the defendant in this case, but

12

they had been told, I just want your input on this

13

because I, the judge, will decide this.

14

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, is that what  is

15

that what makes a difference, then, in the end, that 

16

that  that you're saying that the jury has to be

17

specifically told that that's what it's doing?  That 

18

and you're saying 

19

            MR. WAXMAN:  The jury, no.

20

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   the necessary part of a

21

constitutional system for the jury to be instructed that

22

it has the responsibility to find the aggravating factor

23

that serves as a precondition to death.

24

            MR. WAXMAN:  At a minimum, if, in fact, the

25

jury is performing that function, it cannot, at least in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

a capital case, be told that it is not performing that

2

function, that its advice is  that its verdict is only

3

advisory.

4

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But 

5

            JUSTICE ALITO:  What if it's told that it

6

has to decide on life or death, but the judge is  if

7

you decide on death, the judge is going to review it,

8

and the judge has the power to sentence to life.

9

            MR. WAXMAN:  If the  I mean, there is no

10

constitutional violation  our view  and this again

11

is, is Justice Breyer's Eighth Amendment point, which we

12

endorse.  Our view is that capital sentencing always has

13

be  has been and, as a matter of constitutional law,

14

should be done by a jury.  We're not arguing that other

15

sentences have to be jury sentencing.  And so if a

16

jury  if a jury says it's death, and the judge says,

17

well, I disagree, I'm only going to sentence him to

18

life, there's no constitutional violation.

19

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I'm trying to

20

understand the limits of your argument that what is done

21

under the Florida statute diminishes the jury's sense of

22

responsibility.  The jury's sense of responsibility will

23

be diminished to some degree if they know that their

24

verdict is not necessarily the final word.

25

            MR. WAXMAN:  Well 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Would that be the case 

2

isn't that case whether they  whether they're told,

3

you  you make a recommendation and the judge decides,

4

or you impose a sentence, but the judge can impose a

5

different sentence, a lesser sentence?  There's still 

6

they  they still don't have to bear the responsibility

7

of making the absolutely final decision.

8

            MR. WAXMAN:  So, Justice  Justice Alito,

9

let me separate out what I'm calling the selection

10

decision, that is, life or death and the weighing of ags

11

and mits and the eligibility decision, which is all of

12

the elements of capital murder have been found by 

13

beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury with either

14

unanimously or a sufficient majority, and, therefore,

15

when the sentencing jury is done, you are eligible for

16

the death penalty.

17

            Leaving aside the Eighth Amendment question

18

whether the Constitution then require  requires the

19

jury to make the intensely moral judgment about whether

20

the penalty should be life without parole or death,

21

assuming that a judge can do that, so long as the jury

22

is not told that its input, which is how the Florida

23

Supreme Court has put it, is  so long as they are not

24

told that it's advisory, so long as they are told that

25

you as the finders of fact have to find that beyond a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

reasonable doubt that this capital crime was committed,

2

which includes the following elements, including one of

3

the two specifying aggravators, the Constitution is

4

satisfied.

5

            The  the Caldwell problem is an Eighth

6

Amendment problem.  Caldwell was an Eighth Amendment

7

case.  And in Caldwell what  I mean what the jury is

8

told here  if the system exists as the State posits

9

it, what the jury is told here is far more misleading

10

than what was told in Caldwell.

11

            In Caldwell, the jury was simply told at

12

closing argument that your decision is going to be

13

reviewable by the Mississippi Supreme Court.  And a

14

majority of this Court held that that unconstitutionally

15

diminished the jury's responsibility.

16

            Here the jury was told over and over and

17

over again, and consistent with Florida law, that your

18

judgment is merely advisory; I will be the one to make

19

this determination.  And either  if that isn't  that

20

does appear to be the system, that violates Ring.  If it

21

isn't the system and if somehow it can be argued that

22

the jury is making implicit findings of aggravation at

23

large, that renders somebody eligible for death, then

24

there is a plain Caldwell problem.  And that  that's

25

our position.

5

              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN WINSOR

6

               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7

            MR. WINSOR:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court:

9

            Florida's capital sentencing system was

10

constitutional before Ring v. Arizona, and it remains

11

constitutional in light of Ring v. Arizona.  What Ring

12

required was a jury determination on those facts on

13

which the State legislature conditions the imposition of

14

the death penalty.

15

            In this instance Mr. Hurst got that.  The

16

legislature has determined that the elements necessary

17

to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty is

18

the existence of a murder and one or more aggravating

19

circumstances.

20

            And what the other side calls the advisory

21

sentence included within it a finding, as this Court

22

recognized in the United States v. Jones, that the jury

23

had determined there was one or more aggravating

24

circumstances.

25

            And so the jury 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  How  how

2

is that, when Florida law says that the judge has to

3

find an aggravator to make someone eligibility for the

4

death penalty?

5

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, I agree with the other

6

side that there is a difference between the sentence

7

selection and the sentence eligibility.  And so once the

8

defendant is eligible because a jury has found all of

9

the necessary elements, then what happens after that,

10

Your Honor, does not implicate Ring at all.

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me how

12

this is different than Arizona?  I mean, in terms of the

13

system, just like in the Arizona case, there had been

14

precedent by this Court that Arizona law had been

15

constitutional.  Unlike Arizona, every Florida  every

16

court that has looked  every judge who's looked at it,

17

not one of them has said that they believe personally

18

it's constitutional.  Even the courts affirming 

19

affirm on the basis of the prior precedent, and you have

20

a little less than half the Court directly saying it

21

violates Ring.  So what's the jury finding when it says

22

seven to five?

23

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, if I could back up 

24

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even when it says a

25

murder has been committed, felony murder wasn't.  Felony

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

murder was charged, but we don't know if they found the

2

robbery, right?

3

            MR. WINSOR:  We  at the guilt phase they

4

convicted of first degree murder, which could have

5

either been felony murder with the predicate underlying

6

felony being robbery or premeditated murder.  But to

7

answer your earlier question about the actual 

8

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how do we know which

9

one they picked?

10

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Which  how do we know

12

which one they picked?  Which makes them eligible for

13

the death penalty?

14

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, our position is that

15

they  that he became eligible at the  at the

16

sentencing phase when the jury made its advisory

17

decision, because the jury at that phase was instructed,

18

that if you determine that no aggravating circumstances

19

are found to exist, you must recommend life.

20

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you do agree that

21

that  it doesn't require a unanimous jury?

22

            MR. WINSOR:  It does not require a unanimous

23

jury.

24

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It  and  a simple

25

majority is all you need?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

            MR. WINSOR:  That's right.

2

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we don't have 

3

            MR. WINSOR:  That's right, but that's 

4

that's a jury finding.

5

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   a unanimous jury,

6

even a functionally equivalent unanimous jury, finding

7

those aggravators.

8

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

9

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We don't have a

10

unanimous or functionally unanimous jury finding those

11

aggravators.

12

            MR. WINSOR:  Our reliance for the  the

13

final eligibility determination is that seven to five.

14

            But I would make this point:  The seven to

15

five  there are two things that go on when the  when

16

the jury determines whether someone should be sentenced

17

to death or not.

18

            First, the jury looks and determines whether

19

the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt an

20

aggravating circumstance.  That's the eligibility piece

21

of it.

22

            Then they get into the sentence selection

23

process where they weigh the aggravators that they do

24

find, assuming they find some, against the mitigating

25

circumstances.  And of course the defendant under this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

Court's precedent is allowed to put in any evidence that

2

he wishes.

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  The jury is

4

not asked to find an aggravator.

5

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

6

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not asked to find

7

an aggravator.

8

            MR. WINSOR:  It is, Your Honor.  It is

9

instructed that it may not return a death recommendation

10

without 

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know.  But that's not

12

found at the jury verdict.

13

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

14

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's not found at the

15

trial  after 

16

            MR. WINSOR:  At the sentencing phase.

17

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You're  only at the

18

sentencing phase.

19

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm talking about the

20

sentencing phase right 

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Suppose that the jury comes

22

back at the sentencing phase and says, we recommend

23

life.

24

            MR. WINSOR:  Yes.

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And the reason, though I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28

guess no one would know it, is because they  no 

2

nobody found an aggravating.

3

            MR. WINSOR:  Uhhuh.

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Can the judge, nonetheless,

5

give death.

6

            MR. WINSOR:  No.  Not unless 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No.

8

            MR. WINSOR:  With this caveat.

9

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, we  we have  they

10

have a page in their opinion, in their brief, you know,

11

Page 20, where it cites about six Florida cases, which

12

suggested to me that they thought the answer to that

13

question as a matter of Florida law was, yes, the judge

14

can sentence to death.

15

            MR. WINSOR:  Yeah.  Let me  let me 

16

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that so or not so?

17

            MR. WINSOR:  Let me be clear:  As a matter

18

of Florida statutory law, it is permitted.  We

19

acknowledge that under Ring it would not be permitted in

20

the circumstance where the State is relying on the

21

recommendation to satisfy the eligibility.

22

            Now, you could have a situation 

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's  I missed the last

24

part.

25

            MR. WINSOR:  Okay.

4

            MR. WINSOR:  Right.

5

6

telepathy 

7

            MR. WINSOR:  Right.

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:   though I guess the judge

9

doesn't, that the reason that they did that is no one

10

found an aggravator.

11

            My simple question is:  As a matter of

12

Florida law, can the judge impose the death sentence?

13

Yes or no.

14

            MR. WINSOR:  As a matter of Florida

15

statutory law, yes.  As a matter of Ring, no.  With 

16

            JUSTICE BREYER:  That isn't Florida  I

17

mean, it is.  It's Federal law.  So  I mean, Ring is

18

over.  So  so you say the answer is now no 

19

            MR. WINSOR:  With this caveat, Justice

20

Breyer 

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:   because of Ring.

22

            Because you agree that this case is like

23

Ring, and therefore Ring would apply, and therefore 

24

not this case, but any case in which they recommend

25

life.

Alderson Reporting Company

30

            MR. WINSOR:  Not any case, Your Honor.

2

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  God, I'd like to know your

3

caveat.  What is the caveat?  I'm  I'm on pins and

4

needles here.

5

            MR. WINSOR:  The caveat is this 

6

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I am, too, actually.

7

            Sorry.

8

            MR. WINSOR:  There are multiple ways that a

9

defendant in Florida can become eligible for death.

10

            One is, in this case, where it's determined

11

at the sentencing phase because of the finding within

12

the jury's recommendation.

13

            In other instances it can be  a person can

14

become eligible before the sentencing phase either

15

because they have a prior violent felony conviction or

16

because they have a contemporaneous conviction.

17

            For example, if someone murdered two people

18

and were convicted of double murder, that person at the

19

guilt phase, by virtue of that guilt jury's verdict, has

20

been found to be eligible for the death penalty.

21

            And so at that stage, then in your

22

hypothetical, Justice Breyer, if that sentencingphase

23

jury recommended life, the judge could override it

24

without violating Ring.

25

            Now, I will tell you that, as a matter of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

Florida State law, the judge in that circumstance would

2

face an exacting standard; and, as a matter of fact, no

3

judge has overwritten a jury's life recommendation since

4

before Ring.

5

            So as a matter of function, it is just not

6

something that happens in Florida.

7

            But to answer your question, we do believe

8

it would be constitutional in the situation that I

9

described.

10

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the jury came in

11

hung.

12

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

13

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  On  on the sentence.

14

            MR. WINSOR:  If the sentencing phase 

15

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  The jury  jury, instead

16

of being seven to five, it was hung.

17

            MR. WINSOR:  If the 

18

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Could the judge then

19

impose the death penalty?

20

            MR. WINSOR:  Not in this situation, Your

21

Honor, because that would result in a life

22

recommendation.  A sixsix vote is tantamount to a life

23

recommendation.  And the judge could not override that

24

if he were relying on the jury sentencing finding to

25

satisfy Ring.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

            And even if he weren't, he or she weren't,

2

like I said, it's an exacting Florida State law

3

standard.  The judge would be reversed for overturning

4

that unless he  he or she determined  or unless the

5

appellate court determined that no reasonable jury in

6

those circumstances could have imposed or recommended a

7

life sentence.

8

            And as I indicated, it's been since 1999

9

since any judge actually overrode a life recommendation.

10

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just so I  I understand

11

it:  So you're saying that it  it is possible, but

12

under Florida law the jury would not find the existence

13

of an aggravated  aggravating factor but  and

14

would  and then there are different ways that this

15

would come out  the hypothetical was a hung jury 

16

but the judge could then proceed to find an aggravating

17

factor and impose the death penalty.

18

            Now, you say, now, this hasn't happened.

19

He'd probably be reversed.  But theoretically this could

20

happen.

21

            MR. WINSOR:  Only  that could not happen

22

consistent with Ring, Your Honor, unless there were some

23

other jury finding or admission that established death

24

eligibility.

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you're saying it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

couldn't happen consistent with Ring, meaning that there

2

are certain applications of the Florida law that would

3

be unconstitutional even in your view.

4

            MR. WINSOR:  That hypothetical that we've

5

explored here  again, with their  with the absence

6

of another aggravating circumstance proven outside.

7

            And  and that actually happens in most

8

cases, Justice Kagan.

9

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But  but we don't 

10

we  we don't sit in judgment of  of theoretical

11

scheme that Florida has set up, do we?

12

            MR. WINSOR:  No, Your Honor, and 

13

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And don't we have to

14

adjudge that there has been unconstitutionality in this

15

case?

16

            MR. WINSOR:  That's correct, Justice Scalia.

17

And in this case there was a  a jury recommendation,

18

actually two jury recommendations 

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could I give you another

20

hypothetical scheme, notwithstanding that we don't sit

21

in judgment of hypothetical schemes?

22

            MR. WINSOR:  Sure.

23

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Suppose that the  the 

24

the jury finds an aggravating fact, but then, you know,

25

the judge has this whole separate hearing  right? 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

in which other things are presented to him.  And the

2

judge says, you know, I don't actually agree with the

3

aggravating fact that the jury found, but I have my own

4

aggravating facts, and now I'm  I'm doing all the

5

weighing and I come out in favor of death.

6

            I  I assume that you would say that also

7

would be an unconstitutional application.

8

            MR. WINSOR:  No, Your Honor.  That would be

9

consistent with Ring because, again, once death

10

eligibility  and  and there is a substantial

11

difference that this Court has recognized over the years

12

between the determination of who is eligible for death,

13

and then, of that universe of people eligible for death,

14

for whom is it appropriate?

15

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Quite  quite right.

16

But I'm  I'm hypothesizing a case in which the jury

17

finds that deatheligibility marker 

18

            MR. WINSOR:  Right.

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   right?  If  but the

20

judge throws that one out and substitutes his own.

21

That  you think that would be constitutional?

22

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, the judge in that

23

instance wouldn't be throwing it out.

24

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, he does throw it out.

25

He just says, I don't agree with that.  I'm  but I'm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

substituting my own.

2

            Would that be all right?

3

            MR. WINSOR:  That would be okay because

4

eligibility would have been determined.  Just like if,

5

in my double murder example, the judge believed that,

6

you know, if he were sitting on the jury, maybe he would

7

have acquitted that person of the  of the double

8

murder.

9

            And of course he can't just override the

10

jury's verdict based on a mere disagreement.  In that

11

instance, the death eligibility was determined, not

12

withstanding that he had  he'd been the decision

13

maker, maybe would have decided differently.  The person

14

is eligible for death.  And then it's up to the

15

sentencer.

16

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I have to say that

17

answer surprises me because the death sentence there is

18

not at all a function of the jury's eligibility finding.

19

The judge has tossed out that eligibility finding and

20

substituted his own, which then leads to the death

21

sentence.

22

            So how can we say that that's possibly

23

constitutional under Ring?

24

            MR. WINSOR:  Because the point in Ring was

25

to make sure that no person was subject to a greater

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

penalty than they bargained for when they did the crime

2

without a jury finding.  And in your hypothetical, the

3

jury finds that there is an aggravator.  So there is a

4

jury finding that that person is entitled to the

5

punishment based on the crime that he or she committed.

6

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  The judge has said that that

7

jury finding is utterly irrelevant to his decision about

8

whether to impose death.  That he's imposing death based

9

on something that the jury has not found.

10

            MR. WINSOR:  But at that point the judge's

11

determination is separate from the  the selection

12

point.  The judge is exercising the discretion to

13

sentence within  a person who is determined by a jury

14

to be eligible for the death penalty.

15

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That didn't happen here,

16

did it?

17

            MR. WINSOR:  No, your Honor.

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Good, I thought so 

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the thing is you can't

20

really tell whether that happens in a wide variety of

21

cases.  And this is actually  this goes to this

22

question of because the jury doesn't actually have to

23

find specific things, only the judge has to find

24

specific things, you often are not going to be able to

25

tell whether the judge's sentence is based on the same

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

aggravating facts that the jury has found.

2

            MR. WINSOR:  But it doesn't need to be under

3

Ring, because once the jury has determined that there is

4

an aggravating factor or if it's been admitted, then the

5

person is death eligible and Ring is completely

6

finished.  There's nothing more to do under Ring.

7

            And then we move 

8

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Even though the jury is

9

told, now, whatever you say, it's advisory.  It's not

10

binding.  So you have made a finding of an aggravator,

11

but it's not a binding finder of an aggravator.  The

12

jury is told that whatever they say is advisory.

13

            Doesn't that make a difference?

14

            MR. WINSOR:  No.  What the jury is told is

15

that its ultimate recommendation is  is not binding on

16

the Court.

17

            And that's true.  And that's one of the

18

great benefits of Florida's system.  I mean, Florida's

19

system was developed in response to this Court's

20

decision in Ferment, and this Court has said that the

21

Florida's system provides additional benefits to the

22

defendant.

23

            So you have a judicial backstop.  The

24

matter 

25

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was  that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

before Ring.

2

            MR. WINSOR:  That was before Ring.

3

            And we're not contesting that Ring would

4

require a jury finding or an admission of those

5

elements.

6

            But once the jury makes its recommendation,

7

even if it recommends death, the judge can override that

8

by  for any reason, just based on disagreement alone,

9

which makes it unlike, you know, in a usual capital 

10

or the  excuse me  a usual criminal proceeding where

11

the judge could not overcome 

12

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  I just

13

want  I'm  I'm sorry.

14

            Justice Scalia.

15

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it clear to the jury

16

that they are the last word on whether an aggravator

17

exists or not?

18

            MR. WINSOR:  What it  what the jury is

19

told is that they cannot return a death recommendation

20

without finding a  an aggravating circumstance.

21

That's 

22

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But then they're also told

23

that the judge is ultimately going to decide whether

24

your recommendation stands or not.

25

            MR. WINSOR:  The judge is going to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

ultimately impose the sentence, and that's true.  And

2

that's both true under Caldwell, but it's not 

3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But shouldn't it be clear

4

to the jury that  that their determination of whether

5

an aggravator exists or not is final?  Shouldn't that be

6

clear?

7

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, I  I don't think so,

8

Your Honor, because the determination of the aggravator

9

doesn't yield a death sentence unless the judge, in his

10

or her own opinion, believes the death is appropriate.

11

That's a benefit.

12

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But I'm  I'm talking 

13

I'm talking about what responsibility the jury feels.

14

If the jury knows that if  if  if we don't  if 

15

if we don't find it an aggravator, it can't be found; or

16

if we do find an aggravator, it must be accepted.

17

That's a lot more responsibility than just, you know,

18

well, you know, if you find an aggravator and you  you

19

weigh it and provide for the death penalty, the judge is

20

going to review it anyway.

21

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm not sure that's an accurate

22

characterization of what goes on because it's not that

23

the judge must accept  the aggravator determination

24

has no purpose or no point other than determining

25

eligibility and then the weighing.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

            And if the judge determines that the death

2

sentence is not appropriate for whatever reason, then

3

the fact that the jury found an aggravating circumstance

4

makes no difference.

5

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose then in your

6

earlier hypothetical, the judge  the jury finds an

7

aggravator occurred in the course of the robbery, and,

8

therefore, there is death eligibility.  Then it goes to

9

the judge.  And the judge says, there is simply no

10

evidence to support that aggravating factor, but I find

11

another aggravating factor.  Under your view, the judge

12

could go ahead and impose the death penalty?

13

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, in that instance, that's

14

a little bit different, as I understand it, than Justice

15

Kagan's hypothetical.

16

            First of all, the  the recommendation

17

doesn't specify what  which of the aggravating

18

factors 

19

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But this is my

20

hypothetical.

21

            MR. WINSOR:  Okay.  So to make sure I

22

understand 

23

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I mean, a death case,

24

which is not funny.

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Which honestly sounds the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

same.

2

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, I think the  I think

3

the difference is, respectfully, is his included the 

4

the finding that the judge finds no evidence to support

5

as opposed to just disagreeing with their  excuse me.

6

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And what would happen?

7

            MR. WINSOR:  If you had a situation  and,

8

again, this would be limited  let me make sure I'm

9

limiting the  the answer to the situation where the

10

State is depending on the death recommendation of

11

finding an aggravator.

12

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

13

            MR. WINSOR:  Which is the minority of cases,

14

as we  as we said in the brief.  If the jury made a

15

specific finding as to a specific aggravator  and,

16

again, they wouldn't be instructed on that aggravator

17

unless there was sufficient evidence of it at the  at

18

the threshold stage.  But if the judge concluded that

19

there was insufficient evidence  again, he never would

20

have submitted it to the jury  then that  that

21

probably would not be permissible.

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Go for a second to an

23

analogy.

24

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  There's  there are two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

good other analogies in other areas of the law.  The one

2

that supports you is robbery, force or threat of force.

3

No one ever asks or needn't ask whether six members of

4

the jury thought there was a threat but no actual, or

5

seven members thought there was actual but no threat.

6

Threat or threat of force.  I don't think we have to

7

say.  I don't think so.  So that supports you.

8

            On the other hand, imagine a normal

9

sentencing case.  The statute says, you  you get

10

aggravated punishment if you had 50 grams of cocaine.

11

The jury finds he had 50 grams of cocaine  no.  Sorry.

12

            The statute says aggravated sentence if

13

50 grams of cocaine or meth.  The jury finds he had

14

50 grams of cocaine.  I don't think under Apprendi,

15

which I didn't agree with  but I don't think the judge

16

could say, I'm going to give you the aggravated sentence

17

because I don't believe there was any cocaine, but I do

18

believe there was meth.

19

            MR. WINSOR:  That may well be right.  And

20

that's one of the reasons the jury is not asked to find

21

specific aggravating factors.

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But we do know that the

23

judge here  now still you're having conceded Ring,

24

where the jury says no aggravating factor.  We know that

25

the jury can, if the jury finds aggravating factor X,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

have death on a completely different aggravating factor,

2

but the jury never thought of, namely why.

3

            Now, we know that.  And now compare that to

4

the hypothetical of cocaine and meth.  And then we have

5

Apprendi, which I disagree with still, but...

6

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, I think, Your Honor, in

7

the cocaine and meth example, I believe that the  the

8

Court would look, as they did in Jones, to say, well, is

9

the legislature setting this up as distinctive offenses,

10

or are they setting this up as one offense that can be

11

satisfied either by possession of cocaine or meth.  And

12

if it were the latter, then the jury would just be

13

instructed to find one or the other without any  any

14

specific  and we know is that 

15

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I want to clarify.  You

16

think a seventofive recommendation is finding an

17

element of the crime that makes you eligible for the

18

death penalty by a unanimous or functionally equivalent

19

unanimous jury?

20

            MR. WINSOR:  We do, Your Honor.  And let me

21

say 

22

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, then what do you

23

do with the statement in our case law that says a simple

24

majority is not a unanimous jury?

25

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, we don't say that it's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

unanimous jury.  Let me step back and say that  that

2

the  the seventofive vote, by the way, is not

3

necessarily five votes that there was no aggravating

4

circumstance, because, again, it's  there's two things

5

that go on in the jury room.  One, they decide whether

6

there were aggravating circumstances.  And, two, they

7

just  they do 

8

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And they don't agree

9

with which one?

10

            MR. WINSOR:  Sorry?

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we don't know whether

12

it was premeditation or robbery.  It could be four to

13

three or two to five.  It could be anything.

14

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm talking about the jury 

15

in the sentencing phase now.

16

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Right.

17

            MR. WINSOR:  So a seven to five could well

18

mean that all 12 jurors found a robbery and all 12

19

jurors found heinous, atrociousness, and cruel 

20

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We don't know.  What

21

does the seven to five tell us the jury found?

22

            MR. WINSOR:  The seven to five tells us that

23

at a minimum, a majority of the jury at a minimum, found

24

beyond a reasonable doubt that the State had proven the

25

existence of one or more aggravating circumstances.  And

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

getting back to Justice 

2

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not the same one?

3

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

4

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Not the same?

5

            MR. WINSOR:  Not the same one.

6

            And again, getting back to Justice Breyer's

7

point about the cocaine and the meth, the courts in

8

these situations look at what the  what the

9

legislature's  its definitions of the element.  And we

10

know, as a matter of Florida State law, that the element

11

at issue here, to take someone who is not eligible for

12

the death penalty and to make him or her eligible for

13

the death penalty is the existence of one or more

14

aggravating circumstances, not  not a specific one.

15

            And so it is like Schad v. Arizona, where

16

you  you can't say whether the jury agreed that there

17

was premeditation or whether there was felony murder.

18

And, in fact, that was the case at this defendant's

19

guilt phase back in 1998.  He was convicted of

20

firstdegree murder.  And the guilt phase jury was

21

instructed that they could return that verdict either by

22

finding premeditation or by finding felony murder.  And

23

there was no jury finding as to which one  which one

24

it was.

25

            And so as a matter of  I think to answer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

your question about whether they all need to be the same

2

or not, it would depend on what the  how the State

3

legislature 

4

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But you believe that a

5

simple majority is a jury unanimously or functionally

6

unanimously finding that element beyond a reasonable

7

doubt?

8

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, we  they're certainly

9

finding it beyond a reasonable doubt.  And we're relying

10

on the Court's decision in Apodaca, but  but also 

11

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That was ten to two.

12

            MR. WINSOR:  I'm sorry?

13

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does ten to two

14

automatically mean that seven to five is okay?

15

            MR. WINSOR:  Not automatically, Your Honor.

16

But I think if you look at Apodaca, what they were

17

rejecting was the same arguments that the petitioner is

18

asking this Court to accept, which is that this long

19

history of the unanimity and the 12person jury

20

necessarily means it's  it's brought in to  to our

21

system.

22

            But I'll say this too, the seven to five is

23

not the same kind of jury verdict that you'd have at

24

a  at a guilt phase because of this judicial backstop,

25

because of the other protections that Florida has put in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

in place.

2

            And so even if it's a seventofive vote,

3

you still have the judge coming behind that jury, who 

4

unlike at the guilt phase where he must accept the

5

jury's findings, unless they're not supported by

6

evidence, he or she can disagree for any reason.  He or

7

she can give mercy for any reason.  And that happens a

8

lot.

9

            And so we've cited the  some cases in our

10

brief where a man was convicted of murder in a horrible

11

sexual assault, and by virtue of those two convictions

12

was necessarily eligible for the death penalty.  The

13

jury heard all of the evidence, made a recommendation

14

that he receive the death penalty, and the judge said,

15

no, I'm going to sentence him to life.

16

            And so this Court  you know, this gets

17

back into the jury versus judge sentencing.  But there

18

are some real benefits associated with judicial

19

sentences.  And if you go back to Proffitt, when this

20

Court first upheld Florida's capital sentencing system,

21

it recognized the advantages of judicial sentencing

22

because you're not going to have someone's life or death

23

being determined exclusively on the  perhaps the 

24

the emotions of a jury.

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can  can I go back to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

kinds of hypotheticals that Justice Kennedy and I

2

were  were proposing?

3

            So let's say that there is a jury, and 

4

and it's been presented with evidence that the murder

5

was for pecuniary gain, which is one of the aggravating

6

factors.  And the  the  the jury comes out with a

7

recommendation of death.  So you  and that was the

8

only thing that was presented to it.  So you know

9

that the  the jury has made a death eligibility

10

determination on pecuniary gain.

11

            Then it goes to the judge.  The judge says,

12

you know what, I don't really think that there's enough

13

evidence of pecuniary gain, but I've had this whole

14

hearing, and I find that the thing was  that the crime

15

was heinous and whatnot.  And now I'm going to sentence

16

the person to death.

17

            Now, you say that that's fine; is that

18

right?

19

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, let me  let me  I

20

realize it's a hypothetical, but let me tell you why

21

that couldn't happen in Florida.  A judge would not

22

instruct a jury on an aggravating circumstance for which

23

there was not sufficient evidence to find that.

24

            And so your hypothetical would not happen if

25

there  there was 16 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you know  no 

2

he's  well  he's heard more evidence because, you

3

know, there's a whole new hearing that he has.  And now

4

he's considered it more thoroughly, and he thinks, no, I

5

don't agree with that anymore, but I think it was

6

heinous.  So that would be fine.

7

            MR. WINSOR:  Again, that's not this case

8

because there was no additional evidence 

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, yes, yes, it's not this

10

case.

11

            MR. WINSOR:  But  but the  the  the 

12

if the  if the judge found that the  that there was

13

no evidence of any aggravator 

14

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm throwing out 

15

            MR. WINSOR:  Okay.

16

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   the jury's aggravating

17

factor, but I'm substituting my own.  I thought that

18

that was what you told me that that was constitutional

19

under Ring.

20

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, I think it depends on 

21

on why you're throwing it out.  If there  if  if 

22

as with any jury finding, if a judge finds at the guilt

23

phase that there is insufficient evidence to find any

24

element, then  then he would not rely on the  the

25

jury's determination there.

Alderson Reporting Company

50
1

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  This wasn't at the guilt

2

phase; this was just as a matter of sentencing.

3

            Let me get on with my questioning 

4

            MR. WINSOR:  Yeah.  Sure.

5

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   because I think you

6

answered this one already.

7

            Then the appeal that's taken, right  the

8

appeal is focusing now only on what the judge has found,

9

isn't that right, under Florida law?  The appeal  if

10

the person came in and said that there was insufficient

11

evidence, the appeal would only be as to the judge's

12

finding and not at all to the jury's.

13

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, the  if I understand

14

the hypothetical correctly, someone's convicted, has a

15

death recommendation, a death sentence, and is appealing

16

to the Florida Supreme Court.

17

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And  and he says there was

18

just not enough evidence of all these aggravating

19

factors, so  but that was  would only be as to the

20

judge's aggravating factors.  It couldn't possibly be

21

that he would challenge the jury's.

22

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, the judge's aggravating

23

factors would be detailed in a written order.  But if

24

it  if there were  if  if 

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I mean, I'm just suggesting

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

that the whole appeal process suggests that the crucial

2

death eligibility determination is being made by the

3

judge because that's the only death eligibility

4

determination that the appeals court is ever going to

5

review.

6

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, I think that's  gets to

7

another benefit of Florida's system, is that  that

8

they  they do have this to review.  You know, there's

9

been some suggestion of jury sentencing as a 

10

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes, look, they have

11

something to review.  The problem is it's the judge's

12

thing to  that they're reviewing, not the jury's, and

13

that's a Sixth Amendment problem.

14

            MR. WINSOR:  I don't think it's a

15

Sixth Amendment problem any more than  than here when

16

you.  At the  at the  at the guilt phase when he

17

appealed and there was a  an examination of the

18

evidence and they didn't know whether the jury found on

19

felony murder predicate or on firstdegree murder.

20

They're reviewing the conviction, and they're reviewing

21

the evidence that sustains it.

22

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What about 

23

            MR. WINSOR:  Or they may sustain it.

24

            JUSTICE ALITO:  So to what degree is

25

there 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How about if that

2

jury  I'm sorry 

3

            JUSTICE ALITO:  So to what degree is there

4

a  a real dispute here about the presence of the two

5

aggravating factors?

6

            MR. WINSOR:  There is none, Justice Alito,

7

in my view.  And I know that there was some argument a

8

moment ago about the  about the evidence suggesting

9

that someone else may have committed the crime.  We

10

cited in our brief from their  initial brief in the

11

Florida Supreme Court where they said, "Without any

12

contention, this is a twoaggravator case.  Hurst does

13

not challenge the trial court's findings that the murder

14

was committed during the course of a robbery, and it was

15

especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel."

16

            He doesn't question the seriousness of those

17

aggravators either.  His focus instead, acknowledging

18

all that, was on proportionality review, which is not at

19

issue here, but which, by the way, is another benefit of

20

the Florida system, that the Florida Supreme Court

21

reviews everything for  for proportionality.

22

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I ask you two

23

separate questions on this?

24

            MR. WINSOR:  Yes.

25

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Number one, whenever

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

have we said that a jury waiver on an issue is based on

2

the lack of a challenge by a defense attorney?  Don't we

3

require waivers of jury trials to be explicit and by the

4

defendant him or herself?

5

            MR. WINSOR:  When someone's waiving the jury

6

trial altogether, absolutely.  And, of course, that

7

would be structural error even if there were no

8

objection.  But this is  this is  goes to more like

9

the  the element of offense.  And the Court held in

10

Washington v. Recuenco that the Apprendi error is

11

subject to harmless error here.

12

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So where have we ever

13

said that not challenging something is an admission of

14

that something?

15

            MR. WINSOR:  Well 

16

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  We take plenty of

17

appeals where people are saying, assuming the state of

18

facts, I'm entitled to X.  And then when they go back

19

down, they argue that that goes  that assumption is

20

wrong.  Why isn't this the same?

21

            MR. WINSOR:  Well, we  we cited other

22

portions of the  where they had  excuse me 

23

acknowledged that below back in the sentencing

24

memorandum of the first goaround.

25

            But to follow up on your question,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

Justice Alito, about whether there is an existence of

2

a  of a doubt, the Florida Supreme Court found that

3

both of these clearly existed at the postconviction

4

opinion, which led to the resentencing that's now on

5

appeal here.  They sent it back for resentencing not

6

because of anything having to do with death eligibility

7

or the establishment of aggravators.  They sent it back

8

because there was insufficient effort to produce

9

mitigating 

10

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Has there ever been an

11

appeal in Florida where an advisory jury was given 

12

not given a proper instruction and a resentence was 

13

was ordered for that reason?

14

            MR. WINSOR:  Has there been a Florida

15

Supreme Court reversing a death sentence for 

16

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  An improper instruction

17

to the advisory jury.

18

            MR. WINSOR:  I'd be surprised if there

19

weren't, Your Honor, but I  I don't know.  I 

20

I'll  I'll  I'll look at that.

21

            Getting back to the  to the admission, the

22

evidence was clear.  There is no question that there was

23

a robbery here.  There is no question that there was 

24

that this was heinous, atrocious, and cruel.  And we

25

would ask that the Court affirm the Florida Supreme

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55

Court's judgment.

2

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

3

            Mr. Waxman, six minutes.

4

           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

5

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

            MR. WAXMAN:  Notwithstanding this flurry of

7

papers, I'm aspiring not to use the six minutes.

8

            Let me first  let me go right to

9

Justice Scalia's question, which is not a hypothetical,

10

although I'm happy to answer hypotheticals.

11

            Your question was:  Was the jury told and

12

doesn't a jury have to be told that as to death

13

eligibility, the element of the crime of capital murder,

14

that it makes the decision?

15

            The answer is:  It does have to be told

16

that.  It certainly can't be told the opposite, and it

17

absolutely was not told that.

18

            It was told over and over again, consistent

19

with the statute, that its decision was purely advisory.

20

And I want to refer the Court to the Florida Supreme

21

Court's decision in State v. Steele, which is at 921 So.

22

The Florida Supreme Court in Steele said, first of all,

23

"Nothing in the statute, the standard jury instructions,

24

or the standard verdict form requires a majority of the

25

jury to agree on which aggravating circumstances exist.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

Under current law, the jury may recommend a sentence of

2

death where four jurors believe only that one aggravator

3

applies, while three others believe that only another

4

aggravator applies, because seven jurors believe that at

5

least one aggravator applies."

6

            Florida goes beyond that.  It  it is

7

unlawful  and the Supreme Court of Florida has said 

8

to require  to ask the jury, the sentencing jury, to

9

provide a special verdict that in any way indicates what

10

their, quote, input is on the sentencing factors.

11

            Again, Steele, at page 546.  "Specific jury

12

findings on aggravators, without guidance about their

13

effect on the imposition of a sentence, could unduly

14

influence the trial judge's own determination of how to

15

sentence the defendant.  The trial court alone must make

16

detailed findings about the existence and weight of

17

aggravating circumstances."

18

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that a  post Ring?

19

What's the date of that?

20

            MR. WAXMAN:  Yes, this is post Ring.  And

21

the Court also held that Ring didn't apply.

22

            It has no jury findings on which to rely.

23

            And, in fact, the Court also explained in 

24

later in the decision  in the same decision and also

25

in its decision in Franklin, that Florida bar  quote,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

"Florida bars a special verdict precisely because

2

requiring specific jury findings on aggravators, without

3

guidance about their effect, would harm the jury's

4

independent"  "the trial court's independent

5

determination."

6

            Now, counsel  my  my colleague on the

7

other side here says that, well, there  there would

8

not be a statutory problem, but there would be a Ring

9

problem if we knew that the jury found that no

10

aggravators existed.  So how can Ring be satisfied when

11

we have no earthly idea what the jury found?  It could

12

be, as in this case, as Steele acknowledges, three for

13

one and four for the other.

14

            As to the, I think, hypothetical question

15

that Justice Kagan was asking  so, you know, in a

16

circumstance, how much leeway does the judge have to

17

make his own  his or her own decisions on the death

18

penalty, the Florida Supreme Court has specifically

19

allowed the death penalty to be imposed and a

20

determination of death eligibility to be made based on

21

evidence that was never presented to the sentencing jury

22

and based on an aggravating factor on which the

23

sentencing jury was not applied.

24

            And the notion that there hasn't been a

25

lifeoverride since Ring is  is an interesting fact,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

but this Court, in this Court's Sposiano decision, in

2

this Court's Daubert decision, that's exactly what

3

happened:  The jury said, we want life.  The judge said,

4

I'm hearing  I'm hearing independent evidence, and

5

you're getting death.

6

            Now, as to the supposed concessions in this

7

case, I think I'll rely largely on our brief.  But the

8

notion that somebody  that the lawyers said this is a

9

twoaggravator case is certainly true.  There were two

10

aggravators charged.  And maybe the jury  we know that

11

the trial judge found that two aggravators were

12

satisfied.

13

            This defendant has been making the Ring

14

argument since before Ring was decided.  He raised this

15

as an Apprendi issue at the very first trial.  He asked

16

for a bill of particulars for the  the State to

17

indicate which aggravators it was going to rely on, and

18

he was denied on the grounds that Apprendi doesn't

19

apply.

20

            Even the  again, the central Ring problem

21

in this case, the central Sixth Amendment problem in

22

this case, leaving aside the indeterminacy of seven to

23

five  and maybe it's three for one and four for the

24

other  is that, when a Florida sentencing jury

25

finishes its work, there is simply no question:  The
