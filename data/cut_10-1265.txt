We'll hear argument

Mr. Campbell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARD A. CAMPBELL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. CAMPBELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

For 12 years, Mr. Clair's Federal habeas

11

corpus petition was litigated in the Federal district

12

court in front of the same Federal district court judge.

13

His petition raised 39 challenges to his guilt and

14

penalty, and the judge oversaw years of discovery,

15

presided over a 2-day evidentiary hearing, and received

16

extensive briefing.

17

When the case was under submission,

18

Mr. Clair sent a letter to the judge expressing

19

dissatisfaction with his team of attorneys from the

20

Federal Public Defender's office and requested that they

21

be replaced.

22

their position on Clair's complaint.

23

Defender responded that, after conferring with their

24

client, Mr. Clair was willing to continue with them for

25

that point.

The judge asked both sides' counsel for

Alderson Reporting Company

The Federal Public

Official

The court then stated it would take no

2

further action.

3

court was to issue its decision in the case, Clair

4

complained again.

5

Three months later, just before the

The court issued a written order --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Was there some way

6

that Clair knew that the court was just about to issue

7

its decision?

8
9

MR. CAMPBELL:

I think, Your Honor, the only

way you could be sure was the fact that at some point,

10

as I understand it, the district court judge had

11

announced the day he would be retiring, which would be

12

June 30th of 2005.

13

there it could be expected that the decision was going

14

to be coming out by the end of the -- end of June 2005.

15
16

So, there's probably an inference

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was a deadline set

for all submissions, wasn't there?

17

MR. CAMPBELL:

There was an initial deadline

18

set for the filing of the briefing, post-evidentiary

19

hearing briefing, and there would be no extensions of

20

time.

21

Subsequently, there was, in fact, another

22

submission by Mr. Clair in May of 2005 with some

23

additional declarations.

24

declarations but made it clear it would accept no

25

additional submissions in the case unless it ordered

The court accepted those

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1
2

otherwise, that it would proceed with the decision.
Once upon -- anyway, in June, June 16th,

3

2005, Mr. Clair sent a second complaint about his

4

counsel again, and the district court issued a written

5

order denying that request, finding that Clair's counsel

6

was doing a proper job and did not appear to have a

7

conflict of interest.

8

The district court had an excellent factual

9

basis for that conclusion because it had just completed

10

work on its extensive order denying the petition in Mr.

11

Clair's case.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But this petition had

13

something new, the report that his investigator had

14

turned up this evidence.

15

MR. CAMPBELL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

The -- what Mr. Clair's complaint indicated, there was

17

some additional physical evidence that had not been

18

examined or investigated before.

19

Federal Public Defender actually had met with the Orange

20

County law enforcement about the evidence, and he was

21

upset that there was no further action being taken by

22

the Federal Public Defender regarding testing, seeking

23

DNA testing or testing of that evidence.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

He indicated that the

There has been some

additional litigation regarding this physical evidence

Alderson Reporting Company

since this -- the time of the -- the unsuccessful

2

substitution request; hasn't there been?

MR. CAMPBELL:

Could you tell us what has

happened with that?

MR. CAMPBELL:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

That's correct.

I'm sorry?
I'm sorry.

Could you tell

us what has happened with that litigation?

9

MR. CAMPBELL:

The status of that

10

litigation:

11

filed a notice -- there was a notice of appeal filed by

12

the Federal Public Defender.

13

notice of appeal because of the denial of his

14

substitution motion.

15

Mr. Clair was appointed new counsel.

16

Once the petition was denied, Mr. Clair

Mr. Clair also filed a

Those are merged together.

The new counsel then filed Rule -- a Rule --

17

a request to the district court to entertain a

18

Rule 60(b) motion, which the district court denied.

20

the Rule 60(b) motion.

21

Rule 60(b) motion and then denied it.

Mr. Clair then filed a protective petition,

23

a petition for writ of habeas corpus for a successor

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's what I was referring

to.

MR. CAMPBELL:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
And what -- what has

6

happened there?

7

evidence in connection with that?

8
9

Was there -- was there testing of this

MR. CAMPBELL:

There -- there had been --

there has been some testing of the evidence during --

10

during that time by the Orange County law enforcement in

11

regards to its relationship to the crime or its

12

relationship to another crime that occurred at that

13

time, which I think that information is set forth in the

14

-- the appendix to the opposition to the petition for

15

certiorari.

16

The --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

I'm sorry.

Can you

remind me of what the outcome of that testing was?

19

MR. CAMPBELL:

The -- the outcome of the

20

testing is that, to the extent that the testing was done

21

to see if the -- there was any DNA matching between the

22

other murder that had occurred a couple days before and

23

the murder of Ms. Rodgers -- let's see if I can say this

24

succinctly.

25

of Mr. Clair's DNA with anything from the murder scene

The -- there was -- there was no matching

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

of the Rodgers murder, and there was no matching of any

2

DNA that was found for the perpetrator of the other

3

murder at the site of Ms. Rodgers' murder.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, as I read your

5

briefs, I think you're making, perhaps, two different

6

arguments.

7

you're really concentrating on.

And I want to focus you in on which one

8

MR. CAMPBELL:

Okay.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Which is this

10

presentation seems to be that, regardless of what

11

standard we apply to the court of appeals' review of

12

what the district court did in denying the motion to

13

substitute counsel, that it was wrong.

14

that means it was wrong for the standard you're

15

proposing and it was wrong for the interests of justice

16

standard.

17

And I presume

Am I correct?
MR. CAMPBELL:

I -- yes, Your Honor.

I

18

think under any standard that would apply, we think that

19

the -- that the Ninth Circuit's disposition is

20

incorrect.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

As I read

22

the Ninth Circuit decision, assuming an interests of

23

justice standard because that's the one they invoked,

24

they said what happened here is that the district court

25

didn't hold a hearing to determine itself exactly what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

the dispute was about.

2

failure, basically is what they're saying.

3

And so, it was a process

Now, you make assumptions based on matters

4

that have come up since that hearing about what the

5

dispute was about, and -- but I still don't know what

6

the Federal defender's position was as to whether or not

7

communications had broken down with the client to a

8

point where they thought, as they did on appeal, that

9

they couldn't continue.

10

So, tell me why, assuming we accept that an

11

interests of justice standard applies, the circuit court

12

has no power or applied it improperly by saying --

13

forget about the remedy -- has no power to say, district

14

court judges, you have to at minimum inquire and set

15

forth your reasons based on the facts of that inquiry.

16

MR. CAMPBELL:

Yes.

And the reason is, is

17

that, looking at the record and what was presented to

18

the Federal district court at the time it received the

19

request by Mr. Clair in June of 2005, what Mr. Clair's

20

allegation was, was that he disagreed with the

21

investigative, tactical, strategic decisions that were

22

being made by the Federal Public Defender.

23

that was the reason that was in Mr. Clair's -- Mr.

24

Clair's allegations.

25

That's --

Those premises, even --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what does that have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

to do with "I think they're doing a good job"?

2

it could well be that the judge later decides, after he

3

hears from the Federal defender, I don't think that --

4

we don't think there's anything to be done; he

5

disagrees.

6

the Federal defenders.

But he really never got an explanation from

7

MR. CAMPBELL:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

I mean,

I'm sorry.

I didn't --

He never got an

explanation from the Federal defenders.
MR. CAMPBELL:

Your Honor, it in fact -- it

11

would be -- it's appropriate -- if the record -- if the

12

allegations of the -- of the Petitioner and the record

13

before the court is sufficient for the court to make the

14

finding that there is in fact no basis for substitution,

15

it is not necessary for the court to go ahead and

16

conduct an inquiry or a hearing or to initiate other

17

further process in the case.

18

which went to the physical evidence in the case from the

19

standpoint of the evidence in this case and the way this

20

case was prosecuted and the evidence of Mr. Clair's

21

guilt, the fact that there was additional physical

22

evidence that might be available simply wouldn't have

23

supported any cognizable claims in the Federal habeas

24

corpus action.

25

investigation or inquiry on the part of the court based

And the allegation here

There was no need for any further

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

on what was presented to it at the time.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

What about a -- a possible

3

Brady claim?

4

physical evidence could have been tested at the time and

5

revealed anything at the time of the trial?

6

Is there a disagreement about whether this

MR. CAMPBELL:

There I have to -- I think I

7

have to take what the Ninth Circuit says in its opinion

8

about this case, which is what we have here is physical

9

evidence that could be subject to forensic testing now

10

that was not available in 1987.

11

might be later -- there might have been developments in

12

forensic techniques since 1987 when Mr. Clair's trial

13

occurred doesn't support any claim of trial error back

14

in 1987.

15

any failure back in 1987 because the testing wasn't

16

available to do that they now want to do.

17
18
19

So, the fact that there

You can't show any prejudice from any -- from

JUSTICE ALITO:

What about an actual

innocence claim?
MR. CAMPBELL:

Well, an actual innocence

20

claim, I think to begin with, it wouldn't be clear,

21

based on this Court's jurisprudence at the time, that a

22

factual innocence claim would be cognizable in this

23

Federal habeas corpus proceeding.

24

Court has indicated to the -- has never really actually

25

held that that is a cognizable claim.

It would be a -- this

Alderson Reporting Company

Even if it -- it

Official

12
1

did, it wouldn't be an exhausted -- it would certainly

2

be an unexhausted claim.

3

entertain that type of claim, does provide a State

4

avenue for that type of claim.

5

California, in fact, does

There's plenty of reasons why you would not

6

raise that claim at this point, especially at the end of

7

the process in the first Federal habeas corpus petition.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
3599(e), aren't you?

10

MR. CAMPBELL:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

Yes.
Which requires counsel

to participate in subsequent proceedings.

13

MR. CAMPBELL:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

You are familiar with

Yes.
Of a certain type and

limited.

16

Is it your position that if there is a

17

complete breakdown of communications with an attorney,

18

post-habeas decision, that that is inadequate in the

19

interests of justice or otherwise for a court to say

20

that could implicate proceedings after 3599, so I should

21

substitute now?

22

MR. CAMPBELL:

Actually, Your Honor, yes, it

23

is.

At that point, the defendant has, of course,

24

already gone through the trial, the State appeal, and

25

the State habeas process, and it's particularly at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

State trial and the State appellate process, of course,

2

the standard for substitution of counsel is the

3

potential total breakdown of communications,

4

irreconcilable conflict, conflict of interest.

5

time you've gone through the entire process by which you

6

have gone through the State trial, you've exhausted your

7

claims in State court --

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

By the

Oh, but you're presuming

you're going to win.

10

MR. CAMPBELL:

Excuse me?

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're presuming you're

12

going to win.

13

which the habeas petitioner wins a remand or otherwise

14

has something that's going to follow the habeas

15

decision.

16

I think 3599 applies to situations in

MR. CAMPBELL:

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

17

point is, is that by the time you have reached that

18

juncture in which the claims have been raised and

19

litigated multiple times in multiple forums, that the

20

need for the type of communication and contact that

21

occurs at the trial and State appellate level is not as

22

essential or necessary at that juncture.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, suppose -- suppose

24

the public defender had said to the district court what

25

it said to the Ninth Circuit, and that is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

attorney-client relationship has broken down to such an

2

extent that substitution would be appropriate, what

3

wasn't asked, but suppose the public defender had given

4

that answer to the district judge.

5

judge still have rightly denied the motion for

6

substitution?

7

MR. CAMPBELL:

Would the district

Yes, he would have,

8

especially given that the case at that point was

9

completely under submission and simply awaiting for

10

decision.

11

more litigation to be occurring, the -- whatever the

12

problem with communication is at that point is not going

13

to in any way adversely affect the -- the

14

representation.

15

At that point, we're -- there is, in fact, no

The case is over.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I understand your answers

16

to some of these questions, you are not at all relying

17

on the fact that the district court had made this

18

decision 2 months earlier.

19

would be the same had the district court not made an

20

inquiry 2 months earlier; is that correct?

21

MR. CAMPBELL:

You think that the answer

That -- that is correct.

I

22

mean, if -- yes.

That -- that is an extra fact in this

23

case, but I don't think that's the pivotal fact as far

24

as what the district court could have done as far as

25

exercising its direction -- its discretion in June when

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1
2
3
4

it received the complaint from Mr. -- Mr. Clair.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, when is a district court

required to engage in some kind of inquiry?
MR. CAMPBELL:

Well, when the -- when the

5

allegation is made that -- by the petitioner that he

6

has, in fact, been denied what he is entitled to under

7

3599, which is the appointment and representation by

8

counsel qualified under that statute.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I -- I was again

10

assuming, as Justice Sotomayor was, that if we're in an

11

interest of justice world, if that's the appropriate

12

standard, when is the district -- when does the district

13

court have to make an inquiry, and what kind of inquiry

14

does he have to make?

15

MR. CAMPBELL:

The inquiry -- the inquiry

16

would occur when an allegation was made that, for

17

whatever reason, the counsel does not meet the

18

qualifications that are expected to be met, the counsel

19

has an adverse conflict of interest, or counsel has

20

basically reached a point where he is no longer

21

representing or acting as an advocate for --

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you're -- I thought

23

that that test was an alternative to the interest of

24

justice standard.

25

justice standard applies, and you're giving me back

I'm positing that the interest of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

those same three factors.

2

the interest of justice standard is about?

3

MR. CAMPBELL:

Do you think that that's all

I think in the context of the

4

Federal habeas corpus action, that is in fact -- in

5

which there's a statutory right to counsel -- that is in

6

fact the interest -- where the interests of justice

7

standard would be.

8
9

The interests of --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, this is sort of a

made-up standard.

10

MR. CAMPBELL:

No --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you point to one

12

case in which this standard has been used by any

13

district court or court of appeals?

14

MR. CAMPBELL:

No, I cannot, but --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you point to any

16

inquiry by Congress in which such a test was discussed,

17

considered in any way?

18

MR. CAMPBELL:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20
21

No, I cannot.

But --

Where did you get it

from?
MR. CAMPBELL:

It's actually analogous to

22

the way this Court over the years has divided up the

23

jurisprudence regarding the Sixth Amendment right to

24

counsel and the dividing line between claims of

25

ineffective assistance of counsel and claims of denial

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1
2

of counsel.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, so, what you're

3

suggesting is in noncapital cases, which are less

4

serious, you're going to have a higher bar for a right

5

that the statute gives a judge without any limitation.

6

The capital limitation is that the judge on its own

7

motion or a motion by defendant can substitute.

8
9

MR. CAMPBELL:
of a noncapital habeas.

No, we're not in the context
There's never -- there has

10

never been any construction, certainly by this Court, of

11

what "interests of justice" means in the context of

12

substitution of counsel, of a statutory counsel, in the

13

context of either capital or noncapital habeas.

14

whether it's --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

So, how about a standard

16

that the courts are used to and one that has a basis in

17

Congress's choice, like interests of justice?

18

MR. CAMPBELL:

Well, actually, Your Honor, I

19

think -- I think that we have in fact, to the extent we

20

are analogizing to what this Court has long done as far

21

as dividing questions of Sixth Amendment claims between

22

ineffective assistance of counsel and denial of

23

counsel -- we're in fact submitting a concept that is

24

actually very familiar to this Court and very similar to

25

what this Court deals with in many Sixth Amendment

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

claims.

2

We're simply looking at it in the context

3

now of the fact that you've been given, or entitled, a

4

statutory entitlement to be represented by counsel.

5

are entitled to protect that right to the extent to

6

vindicate that particular right, which is to be

7

appointed that counsel.

8

then you, in fact, have a legitimate reason to ask for

9

new counsel, for new counsel to be appointed.

If you're denied that right,

The

10

interests of justice standard doesn't have a fixed

11

meaning, really, in any context.

12

You

JUSTICE BREYER:

If it doesn't have a fixed

13

meaning.

14

answer is you do think that -- a district judge has a

15

lot of power in many, many areas, and in one of those

16

areas, some district judge sometime could make a

17

horrendous mistake that really wrecks a case, and in

18

such a matter, the court of appeals, if it sees a really

19

horrendous error, will probably have the authority to

20

say you went beyond whatever standard applies, at least

21

here, at least -- okay, we agree on that one.

22

I mean, wouldn't you think -- I suspect the

So, they use some words, "effectiveness,"

23

whatever the words are, "interest of justice," just to

24

reflect that fact.

25

happened.

I mean, that's what I think what

Then your complaint is he didn't abuse his --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

he didn't really abuse anything; he made a good

2

decision, the district judge.

3

comes down to?

4

MR. CAMPBELL:

Isn't that what that

That is certainly an aspect

5

of the complaint, But the -- to us what's very

6

important --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. CAMPBELL:

9

What's important?
What is important here is

that the premise of the Ninth Circuit's opinion is that

10

it would be an acceptable motion for substitution for

11

the -- for Mr. Clair to complain or allege disagreements

12

with his counsel about --

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, what's

bothering you is the way they applied it.

15

MR. CAMPBELL:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -And they applied it in

17

circumstances that you think -- the district judge was

18

actually -- his decision was fine.

19

power to set that aside because it was within -- it's

20

within the scope of any kind of standard you want to

21

call it, including calling it "interests of justice."

22

Am I right in thinking that, that that's really your

23

concern?

24
25

MR. CAMPBELL:

You don't have the

Yes, our concern, Your Honor,

is that the premise of the Ninth Circuit's opinion is --

goes to what the appropriate standard, what the

2

appropriate level of complaint, whatever you want to

3

call it --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, what you

5

really want us to do is to look at the record of the

6

case, go through it, and say, here, whatever words

7

you're going to use, the district court acted within his

8

discretion in saying don't change the counsel.

9

what you -- is that what I'm supposed to do?

10

I'm trying

to get at what you want me to do.

11

MR. CAMPBELL:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

Is that

That -- yes, that is -- yes.
No, you don't want that.

You don't want to stay whatever words you use.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I'm not --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You want us to say the

16

words to be used are the words that we use in deciding

17

whether you have been accorded your constitutional right

18

to counsel, right?

19
20
21

MR. CAMPBELL:
Your Honor.

That's -- that's correct,

I think the confusion here -JUSTICE BREYER:

22

"whatever words you use."

23

MR. CAMPBELL:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't mean literally

25

what you want me to do.

Well -I'm trying to figure out

One is to go back and search

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

all the cases that use some words for a standard, which,

2

as you can tell, I'm reluctant to think that that's

3

meaningful in this case.

4

The other is to look at the record to see if

5

he acted within what you would normally think of as the

6

district court's discretionary authority.

7

MR. CAMPBELL:

I think the confusion here is

8

caused by the fact that the Ninth Circuit opinion

9

started out by borrowing the phrase "interests of

10

justice" and inserting it into a section where it is --

11

where it was not inserted, and it would appear to be a

12

deliberate act of Congress to do that, and then it gave

13

it a meaning which we think under any circumstances

14

would be inappropriate in this context.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose you don't

16

think that the standard of review is abuse of

17

discretion, because if you do, then I suppose you're

18

assuming that the district court has discretion whether

19

to grant the motion or not instead of being confined by

20

a particular standard.

21

MR. CAMPBELL:

Well, abuse of discretion --

22

if the Court is wrong as a matter of law, of course, it

23

automatically -- I mean, that is an abuse of discretion.

24
25

And our -- our feeling here about the Ninth
Circuit's opinion is that the way it has defined what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

would be appropriate in terms of a motion for a

2

substitution and what would trigger an inquiry by the

3

judge -- you know, as a matter of law the Ninth Circuit

4

was wrong in this case.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but abuse of

6

discretion doesn't mean that the judge operates in a

7

vacuum.

8

well, that the standard is an abuse of discretion, that

9

doesn't tell people too much.

If we make -- issue an opinion and say, oh,

Abuse of discretion based

10

on what standards, what inquiries?

11

I'd like to know what your position is on that, because

12

it seems to me that, at the end of the day, it's going

13

to be something very close to interests of justice.

14

MR. CAMPBELL:

And that's -- and

Well, Your Honor, that's --

15

and I suppose the substance -- if we want to call it an

16

interests of justice standard, the substance of it would

17

be that it would not be -- substitution would not be --

18

it would not be appropriate to move for substitution on

19

the basis of disagreements with counsel about tactical

20

or investigative decisions, such as what Mr. Clair did

21

here.

22

has been an actual denial of counsel as provided under

23

section 3599.

The appropriate standard is whether or not there

What would be your argument

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

MR. CAMPBELL:

There are several responses

2

to that.

At one level, the client would -- always has a

3

-- and I think always has basic -- basic decisionmaking

4

authority over basic decisions, whether or not a

5

petition should be filed or not filed, this type of

6

thing.

7

particular instruction would in fact be a failure to --

So, a failure of an attorney to abide by that

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

decisions that -- that the client controls?

10

MR. CAMPBELL:

So, there are some

There have always been some

11

basic decisions a client makes in any -- in any case.

12

But it's not --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's not abandonment.

14

That's an error.

15

abandonment under your definition.

16

That's a problem.

MR. CAMPBELL:

But it's not

It is in fact the failure of

17

the lawyer to truly act as an agent for the client at

18

that point.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, if I tell my

20

attorney follow these leads, that's a failure of an

21

agent as well.

22

MR. CAMPBELL:

It's -- it's -- actually,

23

though, that is in fact normally always considered to be

24

an area that's within the domain of the attorney.

25

types of investigative tactical decisions have always

Those

their clients and not necessarily under the control of

their clients.

4

But let me tell you about the volunteer

situation, as a practical matter.

The volunteer

6

situation is a whole -- almost a whole separate category

7

of litigation from the kind of litigation we're talking

8

about.

9

counsel is not substituted; usually, frequently, a

And what normally happens in those cases is

10

second counsel is brought in to deal with representing

11

the client on those particular issues, and the first

12

counsel remains.

So, that's become --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Given my example, isn't

2

it the case that, under the interests of justice

3

standard, there will be situations in which a

4

substitution like the one I just posited would be right

5

that wouldn't be right under your standard?

6

MR. CAMPBELL:

Your Honor, I think that

7

actually our standard would cover what is appropriate

8

for protecting the defendant's statutory right to

9

counsel and that --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you suggesting that,

11

for noncapital defendants, Congress chose to give them

12

more rather than less?

13

MR. CAMPBELL:

No, not -- not at all.

I

14

don't think -- I don't think noncapital or capital

15

habeas petitioners have any greater -- have any greater

16

right to the assistance of counsel.

17
18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you're saying

capital have lesser rights.
MR. CAMPBELL:

I think -- my guess -- I

20

don't think -- I don't think this Court has ever drawn a

21

categorical difference between them in terms of what

22

rights are available to them for purposes of

representation by counsel.

error.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals held that it was an

21

abuse of discretion to deny substitution without making

22

any inquiry, even of counsel, into the specific

23

situation alleged by Mr. Clair.

24

that Mr. Clair was entitled to substitute counsel.

25

did not hold that he was entitled to amend his petition.

The court did not hold

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

It did not hold that substitute counsel was even

2

required or advised to seek --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So --

Is inquiry always -So, what if last

6

week we get notice from Mr. Clair that he is

7

dissatisfied with his Supreme Court counsel, that

8

communication has broken down, that you plan to argue

9

particular -- present particular arguments, and he

10

doesn't want you to do that.

11

to conduct an inquiry into his complaint?

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Do we have an obligation

I think if you have any

13

obligation whatsoever -- and I want to make clear that

14

there -- these kinds of letters and requests for

15

last-minute substitutions happen all the time, and in

16

the mine run, there may not be any duty of independent

17

inquiry.

18

the court did in March, which is to inquire of the two

19

counsel in the case, is there anything to this, and then

20

rule.

21

If you had one, it would simply be to do what

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

He says -- he

22

says:

I've turned up new evidence, or I think this is a

23

great argument, and my counsel has told me he is not

24

going to raise it, and I want new counsel who will raise

25

this argument.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

Will we have to say -- look at it and say,

2

well, we have to figure out is that a good argument; is

3

it better than the ones counsel are going to raise?

4

MR. WAXMAN:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

No -Has communication

broken down.

7

MR. WAXMAN:

No, of course not.

In this

8

situation, the Court had pending before it a first

9

petition for habeas corpus that alleged both ineffective

10

assistance of counsel at trial and specific Brady

11

violations.

12

question, the district judge announced that he was

13

retiring on June 27th, effective the 30th.

And, by the way, in answer to your first

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. WAXMAN:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I want to --

So, this was beforehand.
I want to ask you

17

about that.

You mention that no fewer than six times in

18

your brief.

What is your point, that the judge altered

19

his disposition of a legal matter before him for his

20

personal convenience?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23
24
25

No.
Then what's the

significance of the fact that he was going to retire?
MR. WAXMAN:

The -- the significance of the

fact that he -- he hadn't announced that he was going to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

retire.

The significance of the fact that he did retire

2

is only to my mind an explanation for why he failed to

3

conduct the minimal inquiry --

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, you are

saying --

6

MR. WAXMAN:

-- that he had previously --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, you are saying

8

he violated his judicial oath for his own personal

9

convenience, that he failed to do something that you say

10

he should have done, because he was retiring?

11

MR. WAXMAN:

I'm not -- he -- the error

12

would have been the same if he had stayed on the bench

13

for another 10 years.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, why do you say

15

six times in your brief that the judge was retiring the

16

next day or retired the next day?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

Because -- it goes to their

18

complaints with the remedy in the case.

19

they're faulting that the remedy is not go back and ask

20

this judge to decide whether substitution was

21

appropriate.

22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That is,

There was another

judge.

24

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

There is another

MR. WAXMAN:

It -- they are alleging that

24

there was an abuse of discretion not to send it back to

25

the judge to do what he had declined to do.

Alderson Reporting Company

And our

Official

32
1

proposition is, because substitute counsel had been in

2

place for 5 years and because the judge who had

3

superintended the case for 12 years was no longer there,

4

it was appropriate and within the court of appeals'

5

discretion under 28 U.S.C. 2106 to remand it to the new

6

judge, with new counsel, for -- to allow new counsel

7

simply to ask the new judge, who had not heard all of

8

the witnesses or the evidence, to demonstrate why, if

9

counsel thought it was appropriate, to allow him to

10

amend the petition under Rule 15(a)(2).

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman --

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that would be pretty

13

incredible.

14

this is a fair reading of what Judge Taylor did?

15

April 29th, as I recall, there was not a problem with

16

the representation.

17

June the 30th.

18

when Clair sent his letter.

Maybe that's what's required.

Why isn't

21

was approaching the point where he was going to issue

22

his decision.

23

way in which the matters that were discussed in the

24

letters could lead to a claim that would go anywhere.

25

As to the physical evidence, if it couldn't have been

He saw the letter.

The judge presumably

He could not see any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

tested at the time of trial, there would not have been a

2

Brady obligation, and an actual innocence claim here

3

would be quite far-fetched in light of the very

4

incriminating statements that -- that Mr. Clair made in

5

the tape-recorded conversation.

6

Had he substituted counsel, he would not

7

have been under an obligation, I think, to allow

8

substituted counsel to amend the petition, which had

9

been pending for a long period of time.

So, he said:

10

Counsel is doing a proper job; there doesn't appear to

11

be a conflict of interest; and I'm going to deny this.

12

Now, counsel could have been appointed and,

13

in fact, was appointed to represent Mr. Clair going

14

forward.

15

And if so, what need was there for further inquiry?

16

Why isn't that a fair reading of what he did?

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, this -- it may very well

17

be what was in his thought processes, but we don't know

18

that.

19

And, in any event -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we know what was in

20

his thought processes, Mr. Waxman, because 14 days later

21

he issued a 60- or 61-page opinion with -- dealing with

22

47 different claims, many of which, many of which,

23

related to actual innocence, which was the -- the

24

gravamen of the letter of the complaint on the 16th.

25

So, you -- you can't consider the letter just in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

isolation from the 61-page opinion that's issued 16 days

2

later.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Oh, I -- I think that the --

4

that a district judge faced with a request to substitute

5

counsel at this very late stage is appropriately --

6

appropriately takes into account everything that has

7

happened, everything that he has allowed to happen,

8

everything that defense counsel has -- has done.

9

is obviously permitted to approach this request with a

10
11

And he

high degree of skepticism and a strong -JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you suggest, Mr. Waxman,

12

that he did not have to make an inquiry in every case;

13

is that right?

You're not saying that.

MR. WAXMAN:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

That's right.

So, what -- when does a

person have to make an inquiry?

I mean --

Well, of course -What in this case required

an inquiry on the judge's part?
MR. WAXMAN:

I think, you know, if the

21

district judge is presented with factually supported

22

allegations that appointed counsel has failed to pursue

23

newly discovered evidence that may be germane to an

24

issue to be decided, especially where the potential

25

import of that evidence is specifically explicated and

Alderson Reporting Company

corroborated by a willing percipient witness, in this

5

judge did in June -- in March.

6

9

Now, in March, the judge -- the judge asked
for a response -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess this goes back

to Justice Alito's question, but suppose the judge says

10

to himself, even if the response comes in, yes,

11

relations are terrible because the client wants the

12

lawyers to -- to investigate a particular thing and the

13

lawyers don't want to investigate that thing.

14

knows it doesn't make a difference either way, because

15

he is ready to issue his opinion, and further

16

investigation of this evidence is not going to change

17

his mind as to any material issue.

18

not reject the motion?

19

MR. WAXMAN:

The judge

Why should the judge

Well, because the judge could

20

not know that based on the allegations in the Ford

21

letter and the Clair letter.

22

It is not the case, going to Justice Alito's

23

point from my question to my friend, that what was

24

represented in that letter, the new physical evidence

25

related only to DNA testing.

There was a specific

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36

allegation that there were fingerprints located at the

2

scene of the crime that previously had been represented

3

to the trial court and to defense counsel either to be

4

unusable or on materials that had gone through the U.S.

5

mail so that the probative value would be limited.

6

both of those things were untrue.

7

And Mr. Ford said to the judge:

And

I'm

8

prepared to explain to you exactly what those prints

9

are, and they have not been tested against anyone,

10

including the other people who were suspected of the

11

identical type murder the night before in the same area

12

or other potential suspects in this case like Mr.

13

Henriksen.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Ninth Circuit -- I

16

They want -- they don't see anything practical here to

do except to try to get the judge, the district judge,

18

to focus on the question of whether the petition should

19

be amended to assert this kind of claim about the new

physical evidence; is that right?

he filed a Rule 60 -- he filed for leave to file a Rule

24

60(b) motion and said in essence:

25

investigator has discovered this new evidence.

Look, the

Alderson Reporting Company

I

haven't been able to test it or examine it.

2

me leave to do that, because I believe it may support

3

The district judge said:

Please give

I'm not going to

allow you to make that motion.

6

The Ninth Circuit issued a mandamus

7

directing the district judge to rule on the motion.

8

then denied it, essentially finding that the motion

9

should be denied because Mr. Grele, substitute counsel,

10

hadn't already proven to her what it is that he was

11

seeking to find out; that is, what does this evidence

12

show.

She

And --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, there's no -- in other

14

words, what the Ninth Circuit in my view is trying to do

15

is they've worked out some complicated way of trying to

16

get the district court to consider the motion about the

17

new physical evidence.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, I --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

right, then unless you -- there's no way to get there.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It has to go with the

5

scope of the remedy that they did.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Uh-huh.
Assuming, as I do and

8

you just said, that what the Ninth Circuit said is

9

there's -- he should have gotten a reason, an

10

explanation, but now there's a new attorney anyway, so,

11

what do we do, isn't the normal thing to do just to

12

remand it, to let the district court decide what steps

13

it wants to take, including to decide whether or not it

14

would have granted the motion for substitution if it had

15

heard the explanation?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning, there was a new

18

judge, but that doesn't -- a new judge is never stopped

19

from considering --

20

MR. WAXMAN:

No, of course --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- what has happened in

22

a case and to decide whether under the facts as they

23

existed at the time --

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

Of course not.

I mean, even

the State acknowledges that asking the judge whether or

Alderson Reporting Company

not there should be substitution when there has been

2

substituted counsel since the appeal was taken is, as

3

they call it, an academic exercise.

the judge --

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it's not academic.

It wasn't academic for the judge below, the new judge --

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

But, technically,

Well --- to say what happened

back then; I don't believe the motion was timely; I

10

don't believe that you were foreclosed from doing other

11

things; motion to substitute would have been denied --

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MR. WAXMAN:

I guess --- end of case.

I guess -- I'm not sure there's

15

a huge difference between that and what the Ninth

16

Circuit did or what I understand the Ninth Circuit to be

17

doing, which was to issue an order -- basically say the

18

substitution motion had to be decided within the broad

19

discretion that the law allows before entry of judgment.

20

I'm going -- we're going to do as best we can to put Mr.

21

Clair back in that position.

22

he -- since counsel said, represented, as soon as it was

23

asked after his letter, there's an irreconcilable

24

breakdown and substitution is advised --

25

It seems to us that since

Why don't you finish

11

your answer to Justice Sotomayor and then go back to

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you.

14

In essence what has happened -- what I

15

understand the court of appeals to have decided is to

16

say, look, because we have had substitute counsel for 5

17

years and the FPD has said it couldn't continue, we're

18

allowing this to go back and let substitute counsel

19

convince the judge, if it can, if it chooses to, whether

20

or not to exercise its considerable discretion in

21

allowing leave to amend the petition before judgment.

22

The judge may very well say no, and the case is then

23

back before us.

24

to do what in essence is the prejudice or materiality

25

inquiry that Judge Taylor would have engaged in if he

But it might say yes.

In other words,

found that there was a breakdown.
I mean, if there's a breakdown and the judge

3

says the only new evidence is that the moon was in the

4

fifth house and that doesn't depend on anything, I'm

5

denying -- or it was a new moon, I'm denying this.

6

Justice Breyer, I -- I agree with you that

7

the Ninth Circuit was struggling to figure out a way to

8

most efficiently resolve the multiple appeals that were

9

pending in front of them.

And they understood from the

10

Rule 60(b) appeal that was also pending and from the

11

appeal on the denial of substitution that there was this

12

newly discovered evidence in the State's files, that the

13

investigator who looked at it thought that it was really

14

important; and they had no record about what it was or

15

whether it should have been considered.

16

Now, they could have said, well, we're going

17

to direct the Rule 60(b) judge to grant leave to examine

18

the physical evidence and analyze it.

19

abuse of discretion of the Rule 60(b) judge not to allow

20

Mr. Clair at least to make some showing.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

MR. WAXMAN:

And it was an

But suppose the --

But the more straightforward

23

way would have been to say you didn't inquire of

24

counsel; counsel may have had a very good reason for not

25

pursuing this; but in the face of a specific allegation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43

by a willing, percipient witness that there is highly

11

is a case that has been going on for, what, 12 years in

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

basic disagreement between the client and counsel was

16

counsel said our best shot is going to be to keep you

17

alive; so, we want to do everything we can to change the

18

death sentence, and then -- and we don't want to detract

19

from that by making a claim of actual innocence when

20

there's -- there'd be a very slim basis for that.

21

that's the judgment, and it's a strategic judgment that

22

counsel made:

23

to concentrate on the penalty phase.

24
25

So,

Our best shot to keep this man alive is

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, if that

had -- if the judge had inquired of counsel and counsel

had given that reason, that would be something that the

2

court could evaluate in deciding whether the balancing

test that is required by the interests of justice

standard satisfied his inquiry.

have said.

But we don't have

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, if -- the

resources of the Federal Public Defender?

offices are notoriously understaffed.

12

individual for an awful long time, and the defendant

I would think that that -- not

about reopening things?

with respect to reopening, and say, well, that's all the

new counsel can do?

The only point

is what -- what Clair was basically saying is:

highly exculpatory, physical evidence in the State's

21

files that was previously represented not to exist.

22

counsel is refusing to do anything about it.

And one of the

things --

MR. WAXMAN:

-- in evaluating these -- the

is as represented, it could be highly material to those

claims.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And one of the

8

things I think the district court would do in that

tactical strategic decision of the lawyer; you don't get

discretionary appointment, where Congress said in the

20

it to the court's or the magistrate's discretion whether

21

3599, the mandatory appointment

We are appointing.

22

And when it did so -- I mean, it is in

23

essence a -- a progeny -- I mean, it is -- it is a

24

cleaving of what was a discretionary obligation.

25

Congress -- Congress had no need in 3599 to reiterate

Alderson Reporting Company

the language in 3006A(c), which itself is not limited to

2

appointments under 3006A(c).

3

I'm reading from page 95 of the petition

4

appendix.

The statute says -- I'm sorry.

It's page 93.

5

That the interests of justice standard says this -- and

6

I'm -- it's the last sentence on page 93a.

interests of justice, substitute one appointed counsel

10

doesn't say "counsel appointed under the discretionary

11

authority of 3006."

12

It, like the rest of subsection (c) of which

13

it is a part, is a general rule for duration and

14

substitution of appointments.

15

true that the sentence itself applied a force, it's, I

16

think, only consistent with what Congress's manifest

17

intention in enacting -- what became 3599(e) to permit

18

that when substitution is requested, that motion be

19

adjudicated in light of the interests of justice.

20

So, even if it were not

And, indeed, that's what the State told

Judge Taylor the standard was in this very case.

22

mean, look at it this way, Justice Scalia:

23

a district court -- I realize that the cases will be few

24

and far between, very few and very far between, where at

25

a late stage of the proceedings, the court will

Imagine that

interject substitution of counsel over the State's

2

opposition and over the court's understandable desire to

3

serve the public interest in efficiently and fairly

adjudicating motions.

5

But in the rare case where the district

6

judge says, gee, I think the public interest -- I think

7

that the interests of justice really would support

8

putting somebody else in here, but I can't because it

9

doesn't fit within one of the three boxes of the tests

10

that the State ex nihilo has announced in its merits

brief in this Court -- it's just impossible to imagine

12

that Congress would have wanted a judge to say, gee,

this is one of these one in a million cases where the

interests of justice really requires it, but I can't do

15

it.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the interests of justice

17

is such an open-ended test.

doesn't it follow that it will only be in the rarest of

be found to have abused his or her discretion in denying

a substitution request?

for -- provided the basis for any claim that could have

this late date, in the face of the other evidence that

MR. WAXMAN:

evidence in this -- the case against Mr. Clair in

Or are you asking us essentially to make a

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think the answer -- I

14

know how frustrating this is, but I think the answer is

15

to both -- is yes to both scenarios, particularly

16

because there was no physical evidence linking him, and

17

really the State's case boiled down to this pretty

confusing statement.

wait a minute.

20

idea that there was any dispute about physical evidence,

21

or any physical evidence was in the State's files that

22

hadn't been disclosed and hadn't been tested.

23

It was particularly salient to say

I mean, the -- the district judge had no

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose defense

24

counsel had introduced at trial fingerprint evidence

25

showing that 10 people were present at some point in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52

that house and they weren't people who lived there.

2

That's -- it's weak exculpatory evidence for the

3

defendant at best that there were -- there were unknown

4

people in the house.

5

Who knows who they were?

6

It might have been the cable guy.

MR. WAXMAN:

So, it doesn't help very much.
Justice Alito, I mean, we're,

7

of course, all arguing in a vacuum here because we don't

8

know what the fingerprint evidence, if it were tested

9

and run against databases, would show.

10

But let me give you one not at all

11

far-fetched example:

12

coroner had determined that because of the extraordinary

13

similarity between the murder of a woman in the

14

neighborhood -- very close by the night before and this

15

one, including the very peculiar puncture injuries, the

16

coroner's report in the State's file said this is very

17

likely the same perpetrator.

18

The State had -- the county

The State has identified the perpetrator of

19

that other crime.

And we don't know whether even at

20

this day the State has matched that perpetrator's

21

fingerprints with the fingerprints that were discovered

22

next to the victim in this case.

23

far-fetched to say that in a case involving either
