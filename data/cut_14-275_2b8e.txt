 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

this morning in Case 14275, Horne v. Department of 

5

Agriculture. 

6

8

 Mr. McConnell. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9

 MR. McCONNELL: 

10

it please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 Thank you for being willing to hear this 

12

little case a second time.  It does involve some 

13

important principles and the livelihoods of Marvin and 

14

Laura Horne, and more indirectly, hundreds of small 

15

California raisin growers will be profoundly affected. 

16

 This is an administrative enforcement 

17

proceeding that was brought by the Department of 

18

Agriculture against my clients commanding the 

19

relinquishment of funds connected to specific pieces of 

20

property, namely, reservetonnage raisins.  My clients 

21

appear in their capacity as handlers, but under their 

22

in the particular facts of this case, the economic 

23

circumstances are somewhat different than are ordinarily 

24

true in  in this industry because as handlers, the 

25

Hornes actually assumed the full financial

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

responsibility for the raisins that were not turned over 

2

to the Department of Agriculture. 

3

 The producers in this case were fully paid 

4

for their raisins.  This is a factual finding to be 

5

found in the judicial officer's opinion at 66a of the 

6

appendix to the  to the petition.  The Hornes paid the 

7

producers for their raisins.  According to the judicial 

8

officer, those raisins became part of the inventory of 

9

the Hornes.  The  when the Raisin Administrative 

10

Committee, which I'll refer to as the RAC, came after 

11

the raisins, it was the Hornes and the Hornes only who 

12

bore the economic burden of this taking. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought that  I 

14

thought the growers were paid only for the volume that 

15

they were permitted, that was permitted, the permitted 

16

volume, and that they were not paid for what is  goes 

17

in the reserve pool. 

18

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Justice Ginsburg, that is 

19

true in the ordinary course.  That was not true in this 

20

particular case because of the unusual business model 

21

of  of my clients.  These producers were paid the 

22

for all of their raisins. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Are you objecting to the 

24

volume limitation, or is it just that the  the reserve 

25

pool that you find 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

 MR. McCONNELL: 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3

 MR. McCONNELL: 

We 
 troublesome? 
We believe that a volume 

4

limitation would be a use restriction.  It might 

5

possibly be challengeable under the Penn Central Test, 

6

but it is  would not be a per se taking.  In this 

7

case, because the government, the RAC, which is an agent 

8

of the Department of Agriculture, actually takes 

9

possession, ownership of the raisins, it is that  it 

10

is that aspect of the case which we're challenging 

11

against the taking. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But that's what so  so 

13

puzzling because if  if you're not challenging the 

14

volume limit itself, you can't sell more than 60 percent 

15

of your crop. 

16

 MR. McCONNELL: 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's correct. 
And what happens to the 

18

rest of it?  You're not going to be able to feed your 

19

family on the rest, the 40 percent. 

20

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Again, in the  in the 

21

ordinary case, the reserve percentage, which in one case 

22

was 37 percent and  and it was 30 percent and in the 

23

other case 47 percent, is  is handed over to the 

24

Raisin Administrative Committee. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if it wasn't, if 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

if we just had a volume, you cannot sell more than X 

2

amount, then I take it that the grower would get 

3

nothing, nothing at all.  At least with this reserve 

4

pool, there is the possibility of getting some money. 

5

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Well, it  it all depends. 

6

The way volume controls generally work is that the owner 

7

of the produce is permitted  they have to hold back a 

8

certain amount in a reserve and then they're permitted 

9

to sell that reserve as the market conditions continue. 

10

 In this case, of course, the RAC sold the 

11

raisins, in some cases even above the field price. 

12

There was a market for the raisins, so I would assume 

13

that volume controls under these economic conditions 

14

might have left the  these particular people better 

15

off than under the current circumstance. 

16
17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what you're 

complaining about is the administrative expenses? 

18

 I don't  I still don't understand why this 

19

makes this a Penn Central case as opposed to a  a per 

20

se taking.  You've  you've given up on this being a 

21

Penn Central case. 

22
23
24
25

 MR. McCONNELL: 

We have never claimed that 

there was a Penn Central case. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And so basically, you 

see a nexus between the regulation and its purpose.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

 MR. McCONNELL: 

We do.  But more 

2

fundamentally, this is an actual transfer of the raisins 

3

themselves to the government.  This is the government 

4

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How is this different 

than Leonard? 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

Well, Leonard involved 

7

oyster shells which are owned by the State.  They're 

8

wild animals, they're the property of the State, and the 

9

oystermen had no property interest in them other than 

10
11

what the State chose to license them to harvest. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Gosh, is that really true, 

12

Mr. McConnell?  I mean, when these fishermen took the 

13

oysters, the  you know, including the shells from the 

14

bay or other waters, you know, they could then sell the 

15

oysters.  Why weren't the oyster shells theirs at that 

16

point? 

17

 MR. McCONNELL: 

They have whatever property 

18

interest the State of Maryland provided for them.  And 

19

the State of Maryland withheld the 10 percent of the 

20

oyster shells for the purpose of essentially fertilizing 

21

the  the oyster that 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I mean, I guess I  I would 

23

have thought that as soon as they bring the oysters out 

24

of the bay and they haul their catch to shore, that what 

25

they've hauled to shore is then theirs.

Alderson Reporting Company

3

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Except for the 10 percent 

that the State reserved, yes. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, so I guess what 

4

Justice Sotomayor's question is is why wouldn't the same 

5

be true as to raisins? 

6
7

 MR. McCONNELL: 

animals, even if they're dancing 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 MR. McCONNELL: 

10
11

Because raisins are not wild 

 and they did not 

originally belong to the Federal government. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So you think that Leonard 

12

is  is  is an animals case as opposed to a, you 

13

know, the State can tax your property case? 

14

 MR. McCONNELL: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16
17

Yes, I do. 
That's not how it was 

applied by the court.  They called it a tax. 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

They did also call it a tax. 

18

And I'm perfectly happy to address whether this is a 

19

tax, because under this Court's standards for criteria 

20

for determining a tax, this certainly is not one. 

21

Referring to the criteria in the NFIB case, this is not 

22

in the Internal Revenue Code, it's not collected by the 

23

Internal Revenue Service.  It's not author  there's no 

24

tax authorized by  by Congress.  The proceeds of the 

25

tax do not go into the general treasury.  This is not a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1
2

tax. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But neither did they 

3

but it didn't happen that way in Leonard, either.  What 

4

the Court was basically saying is the government could 

5

do this because this is a good in commerce.  As long as 

6

it could meet the Penn Central test, that there is some 

7

nexus between the government's goal and the  and 

8

the  and  and the regulation, then it's okay. 

9

 Now, there they used it to fertilize oyster 

10

ponds or to refertilize the oysters.  Here they're doing 

11

it to maintain prices and giving you whatever left 

12

whatever is left over on the reserve. 

13

 MR. McCONNELL: 

The fact of the matter is 

14

that the oysters belong to the State of Maryland and 

15

when the State of Maryland decides to allow fishermen to 

16

harvest the oysters 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you tell me where 

in Leonard that was discussed? 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

It's  I'll be very happy 

20

to file a supplemental brief with the Maryland citations 

21

indicating that the oysters belonged to the State of 

22

Maryland. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I thought that the  what 

24

the Constitution required for a taking was just 

25

compensation, not  not a reasonable nexus to a  a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1
2
3

good policy.  Am I  am I wrong about that? 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

You are not wrong about 

that. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I didn't think so. 
But I  I suppose that 

6

question, underlying the government's briefs in this 

7

we can ask them what its position is or you can 

8

characterize their position if you choose  is the 

9

thing  since we could do this other ways, what 

10

difference does it make?  Do you understand to  that 

11

to be their  an underlying premise in their argument 

12

or  or is that unfair on my part? 

13

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Well, they certainly say 

14

that from time to time and this Court two years ago in 

15

Koontz rejected arguments of that  of that sort.  But 

16

in fact, there is a fundamental difference between a 

17

volume control, which is present for a number of 

18

agricultural products, versus the taking, because in 

19

this case the government literally takes possession of 

20

the raisins.  It can use the raisins as collateral to 

21

get a loan.  It can give the raisins away.  It can 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

23

 MR. McCONNELL: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

If that's the 
 sell the raisins. 
If that's your position, 

why didn't you ask  you're attacking this reserve

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

arrangement and the  the possession  the 

2

government's possession of the raisins themselves.  And 

3

you  as far as I've heard so far, you are not 

4

attacking volume limit; you cannot market more than X 

5

amount.  Why didn't you then ask the Department of 

6

Agriculture for an exemption from the reserve pool? 

7

Instead of  see, what you're trying to do now is to 

8

get rid of the volume limit as well. 

9

 MR. McCONNELL: 

In this particular program, 

10

there's no  there is no separate volume control in the 

11

sense that there  there's no regulation that tells 

12

either producers or handlers how to use or sell raisins. 

13

Instead, they're told to set aside the raisins and give 

14

them to the government.  So here there is a taking, 

15

and 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the part that isn't 

17

given to the government, suppose we just  couldn't you 

18

have asked to excise that part of it and still leave the 

19

limit on the amount that could be marketed?  I mean, we 

20

have a division between what goes in the reserve and 

21

what can be marketed. 

22

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

23

way this case arose is that the Department of 

24

Agriculture came after my clients.  We did not  this 

25

is not our lawsuit.  The Department came after our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

3

clients. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It is your  is it a 

is it counterclaim? 

4

 MR. McCONNELL: 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

6

 MR. McCONNELL: 

It's  it's a defense. 
A defense. 
It's a defense.  The  the 

7

Department says, give us either raisins or their 

8

monetary equivalent and we say that's not constitutional 

9

without compensation. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If  if there was a 

11

taking, would there be any obligation on your part to 

12

propose an alternative to the taking?  The government 

13

comes and takes your property.  Can't you just resist 

14

the taking without saying, oh, government, you can do 

15

this in another way.  Please do it in a different way. 

16

You don't have to do that, do you? 

17
18

 MR. McCONNELL: 
that 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. McCONNELL: 

21
22

We do not, and I'm not sure 

I didn't think so. 
 any alternative ways 

would even be permitted under the regulation. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So  so my question is, it 

23

goes on from this.  I mean, maybe the answer is, well, 

24

just don't decide that.  But look, I assume with you for 

25

the moment for argument's sake, I have some raisins in my

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

basement.  I'm in this program.  The government comes 

2

with a shovel and some burlap sacks; it takes the 

3

raisins.  I would say, well, sounds like a taking to me. 

4

 At the next point 

5

 MR. McCONNELL: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Me, too. 
 the Constitution doesn't 

7

forbid takings.  It says what you have to do is pay just 

8

compensation.  Now, it's at that point I want to know 

9

what happens, because I guess the government could 

10

argue, look at this program, it's a big program.  This 

11

program, what it does is it gives raisin farmers, at the 

12

public's expense, more money.  So if, in fact, you don't 

13

want us to take your raisins, all right, fine.  But 

14

there'd be no program if everybody said that.  So we 

15

have a rule against free riders. 

16

 Now we'll give you what it cost you to take 

17

your raisins.  What it cost you is, in fact, the 

18

difference between what you receive given the program 

19

and what you would receive without the program.  That 

20

difference works in your favor.  It gives you money.  It 

21

doesn't take money.  So there is no compensation due. 

22

In fact, if we were to have compensation, you should pay 

23

us, the government. 

24
25

 So how are you going to get by that part? 
And if you can't get by that part, how are you going to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1
2

avoid paying the fine? 
 See, I don't see the relation between the 

3

taking argument, which is maybe all we have to decide, 

4

and how eventually you either get some money or you 

5

don't have to pay the fine.  If you have a minute, I'd 

6

appreciate just the explanation. 

7

 MR. McCONNELL: 

8

 The  there is both  both a conceptual 

9

I  I would love to. 

and a practical 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Yes. 
 response.  Let me give 

12

the practical response first, which is that my clients 

13

are certainly not better off.  By the secretary's own 

14

calculation the price of raisins was $63 per ton higher 

15

with the volume controls than it would have been in an 

16

unregulated market. 

17

 The field price that year was $810 per ton. 

18

Taking away 30 percent of their raisins does not end up 

19

with the  with my clients better off as a result of 

20

the program.  Quite the contrary.  They  they lose 

21

money.  We have the calculation in our reply brief. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I don't want to interrupt 

23

you, because you're going to get to the theoretical 

24

argument in a moment.  But wouldn't  isn't the 

25

response to that, well, the price that you just quoted

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

is because of this program, and that's circular, or am 

2

I wrong about that? 

3

 MR. McCONNELL: 

No.  No, you're  by the 

4

Secretary's own calculations, $63 of that 810 is 

5

attributable to the volume controls in the program. 

6

Only $63. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Except weren't we told 

8

that the demand for raisins is inelastic?  So if you 

9

glut the market, you're going to have what happened 

10

before the RCA. 

11

 MR. McCONNELL: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

 MR. McCONNELL: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17

You're going to have 

prices dropping. 

14

16

Well, it's 

It is 
That's the  that's 

the purpose of free competition, isn't it? 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

Actually, under today's 

18

conditions, the elasticity is not as enormous it would 

19

 as it would need to be for this to be a profitable 

20

program. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that's today, but 

you haven't paid a reserve in years now. 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

Well, we're talking  when 

24

I say today, what I mean is the two years  the two 

25

years that are 

Alderson Reporting Company

16

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So one of your 

arguments could be  I get your argument now. 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

Now, the conceptual point is 

4

that this is a per se taking.  And it's  if  if 

5

there were benefits, such as I don't believe that there 

6

were, if there were, that would at most go to whether 

7

there was implicit in  inkind compensation for the 

8

taking, which would go to the  to the question of 

9

compensation. 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Exactly. 
Implicit inkind  inkind 

12

compensation is a complicated matter.  It has to do with 

13

whether there were special benefits, that there's a 

14

split all over this  all over the country on that.  I 

15

don't think we want to get into whether this would be a 

16

special benefit.  In this case 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  So what we should 

18

say, in your view, do you have any objection to my 

19

writing, if I were to write it, like this, taking. 

20

Yeah, it's a taking.  Okay.  But the Constitution 

21

forbids takings without compensation.  The object of the 

22

program is, at least in general, to give farmers more 

23

compensation than they would have without it.  Programs 

24

can work badly, sometimes they're counterproductive, but 

25

if this is working well, that's what happens.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

 So we send it back to the court to see, did 

2

the program work well?  Did it work to actually make 

3

your  your client better off?  What rules do we 

4

follow?  That's how we should do this, in your opinion. 

5

 MR. McCONNELL: 

I think not.  Now, if  but 

6

I'm close to there.  If this were an eminent domain 

7

proceeding, then the lower court would determine whether 

8

there was implicit inkind contribution.  If it were an 

9

inverse compensation proceeding, possibly the same, but 

10

this is actually an enforcement action.  It is 

11

specifically guided by the regulations in  in the 7 

12

C.F.R. 

13

 And under those regulations, we know exactly 

14

what takes place.  And implicit inkind contribution is 

15

not provided for in those regulations.  What is provided 

16

in those regulations is that the  if reservepool 

17

raisins are not handed over to the RAC, the handler must 

18

pay  multiply the number of raisins by the field 

19

price, and that is it.  Now, that is also the measure of 

20

the value of the raisins. 

21

 So that if they take that, the compensation 

22

is exactly that, and the two things simply are a wash, 

23

because the regulation  and I think the broader 

24

principle here is that this is actually not a program 

25

which is designed to provide compensation.  The

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

government almost concedes this.  This is not  this is 

2

not like getting land for a post office where the 

3

government intends to pay.  This is more like a program 

4

like  like a Kaiser Aetna or some of the others, where 

5

if it is a taking, the government has no intention of 

6

paying compensation, that's not the kind of program it 

7

is.  And in cases 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr.  

9

 MR. McCONNELL: 

May I just  in cases where 

10

there's a  there's a taking, and the program does not 

11

contemplate compensation, the standard judicial remedy 

12

for that is to  is to forbid the taking. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm sorry, it was 
Can I take you back, Mr. 

15

McConnell, to the  whether it is a taking point?  And 

16

I've  I've just been trying to think about whether 

17

your argument would apply to other kinds of programs and 

18

how it might apply to other kinds of programs. 

19

 So how about just programs where the 

20

government says, give us  produce records for us.  I'm 

21

sure that there are a lot of programs like that in the 

22

world.  And there is something intuitive about your 

23

saying, well, the government is asking us to turn over 

24

stuff.  And I'm wondering, it seems to me that the 

25

government asks people to turn over stuff all the time

Alderson Reporting Company

in the form of records.  How would that fare under your 

2

argument? 

3

 MR. McCONNELL: 

If the  if the records 

4

if what the government is asking for is information, 

5

this is not going to be a taking.  If the records are 

6

themselves of historical value, as they were in Nixon v. 

7

General Services Administration 

8
9
10
11
12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I don't know if they're 

historical 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

 and they want to put them 

in the museum, then they have to pay for them. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I don't know if they're 

13

historical value.  They're just physical objects, in the 

14

same way the raisins are physical objects.  And the 

15

government wants some records. 

16

 MR. McCONNELL: 

The government does not take 

17

permanent possession of records.  If I'm, say, in an IRS 

18

audit, and they ask me to show records to establish my 

19

tax deductions, I show them the records, they see the 

20

information, it is not a taking. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, but  so you're saying 

22

that the government couldn't ask you to deliver records 

23

to them. 

24
25

 MR. McCONNELL: 

I did not say that.  They 

can ask me to do that.  And it is not a taking unless

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

they've taken a permanent possessory interest.  If they 

2

go off and sell the records, the way they sell the 

3

raisins, then I  then there's been a taking. 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

They're just keeping the 

records.  They're keeping the records. 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

If they're keeping the 

7

records forever, I  I'm not sure, but I doubt very 

8

much that that would be a taking.  Again 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I just don't 

understand. 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

Again, the value  if the 

12

value of the records is the information, which is what I 

13

assume it is in a regulatory program, we're not talking 

14

about actual physical property. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, there  there are 

16

cases on custodial  government all the time in 

17

criminal cases takes control of valuable objects for 

18

evidence, and sometimes it keeps it forever and ever. 

19

And in those cases, I think there is a taking if it's 

20

too long, I think we've said that.  Or I think other 

21

courts have said that.  In other words 

22

 MR. McCONNELL: 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I think there's 
 the government can 

24

keep it only so long as it's reasonably necessary 

25

for the case.  You have a valuable diamond ring which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

is evidence and the government keeps it, but it keeps 

2

it only for so long as it 

3

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Well, I  I think that 

4

there are complicated sets of rules having to do with 

5

contraband and having to do with property that is used 

6

as an instrumentality of a crime and so forth.  But this 

7

is extremely far afield from raisins, which are a 

8

which are a valuable piece of property 

9
10
11
12
13
14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

If you 
Well, I'm trying to 

understand why 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

 which the government 

takes and sells. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I'm trying to 

15

understand why it's far afield, and what it's far afield 

16

from.  I mean, you even said, well, information is no 

17

problem.  But people have property interests in 

18

information all the time, and if the government says you 

19

have to give us that information, which counts as 

20

property, why is that not subject to your rule? 

21

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Information can be property 

22

when it's intellectual property; for example, trade 

23

secrets can be property.  I don't think ordinary records 

24

such as the IRS demands from taxpayers is a taking. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So how about the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

Monsanto case, where we said the turning over of trade 

2

secrets, which is property, you've just admitted that, 

3

for the privilege of selling other commodities, the 

4

pesticides, was okay, wasn't a taking.  How do you deal 

5

with that case? 

6

 MR. McCONNELL: 

The  there is broad 

7

language in that case, which this Court cut back upon in 

8

Nollan v. California Coastal Commission.  In  in  in 

9

Nollan, the Court held that Monsanto could not stand for 

10

the proposition that it is an affirmative benefit to 

11

someone simply to allow them to use their property in 

12

an  in an ordinary sense.  There has to be an actual 

13

affirmative government grant of a benefit for the 

14

condition argument to work. 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Getting 63  getting 

16

$63 more a pound for what you sell seems like a 

17

significant benefit. 

18

 MR. McCONNELL: 

They are not given  the 

19

$63 results from volume controls.  That does not require 

20

a taking.  The taking itself is of absolutely no value 

21

to the producers or anyone else other than those who 

22

receive the export subsidies from the sale of the 

23

raisins.  They're the only ones who benefit from  from 

24

the actual taking. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you couldn't do it.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

You would have a product that would be valueless except 

2

for that which you could eat at home, but you didn't 

3

intend to eat it at home because you gave it up for 

4

sale.  If they  if they gave you the raisins, would 

5

you be able to export them and get the government 

6

subsidy? 

7

 MR. McCONNELL: 

If they  my  my clients 

8

are not actually in the export business.  If the  if 

9

my clients were selling raisins for export, they would 

10

be entitled to receive the export subsidy, but that's 

11

not the business that they're in. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

My point is just you 

13

couldn't otherwise sell this commodity.  If all they did 

14

was put it in a house and say to the producers, sell 

15

60 percent this year, what would you do with the 

16

raisins? 

17

 MR. McCONNELL: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

 MR. McCONNELL: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Well, the way 
They'd just sit there 
 the way 
 right? 
 other programs with 

22

volume controls work is that there's an initial reserve, 

23

and then as market conditions develop and more 

24

information is available, the owners of the product are 

25

permitted to  to release more and more into the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24

market.  And  and in these 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3

 MR. McCONNELL: 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

5
6

Well, suppose 
 particular 
 the market goes the 

other way? 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

Well, that would be a 

7

different  that would certainly be a different case. 

8

And  and if it went completely the other way, it could 

9

well be that the  that the owners of the raisins 

10

receive no money at all.  But it's still  it's still a 

11

restriction on their use.  The raisins haven't been 

12

taken from them. 

13

 In this case, the raisins are actually taken 

14

from them and the government sells them.  In fact, in 

15

in one of these years, the government was able to sell 

16

the raisins for more than the field price 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 because of that. 
 still, the curlicue on

21

there's still what we do about this fine.  And the 

22

reason that I'm  this may be just a curlicue on the

case.  But  but the way I'm thinking of it, imaginary

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

9

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

10

 Petitioners isolate just one feature of a 

11

comprehensive program regulating the commercial 

12

marketing of a fungible agricultural product, a 

13

regulatory program that was established with producer 

14

approval and is established for their benefit.  It is a 

15

cooperative program among the Secretary, producers, and 

16

handlers. 

17

 The raisins are not put into the program for 

18

the benefit of the government.  They are put into the 

19

program for the benefit of producers, and they enter the 

20

stream of  of commerce.  In fact a producer is 

21

affected by this program 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

These plaintiffs are 

23

ingrates, right?  You're  you're  you're really 

24

helping them? 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

That  that's 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's for their benefit, 

and  and  and they wanted this, didn't they? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

The  these Petitioners do 

4

not want the program, but the program was established on 

5

the premise that it is for the benefit of the producers. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You say it's one little 

7

feature of an overall program.  That little feature 

8

happens to be the taking of raisins. 

9
10

 MR. KNEEDLER: 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We  we 
I mean, you could have a 

11

lot of features.  There's no objection to having many 

12

features, but where one of them is a taking, you  you 

13

have to justify it by just compensation. 

14

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

The  the question is 

15

whether it is a taking, and we believe it  we believe 

16

it is not. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You used to say  you used 

18

to say it's not a taking if it involves just personal 

19

property, only real estate.  Are you still 

20
21
22

 MR. KNEEDLER: 
not 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

abandoned that position? 

24

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

25

That  that  that has 

The government has 

That  that has not been our 

position.  We have  we have  we have not argued that

Alderson Reporting Company

27

personal property is not subject to the  to the Just 

2

Compensation Clause such that if there were  if the 

3

government came in and  and  and took someone's 

4

car or someone's 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Took your raisins, for 

example? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, the  the government 

8

has not taken the raisins  let me  let me just 

9

if  if I could set this up and explain how it 

10

operates, this program operates only when the producer, 

11

the grower, has voluntarily submitted  committed the 

12

raisins to the stream of commerce.  They have been put 

13

in  they have been put into the stream of commerce. 

14

They are turned over to the handler.  The Marketing 

15

Order regulates only the conduct of handlers. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, the  the 
But 
 the government can 

19

can prevent you from putting something into the stream 

20

of commerce, can charge you for putting something into 

21

the stream? 

22

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I  I think the  the 

23

the government can attach reasonable conditions on 

24

entering a stream of commerce, and that 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER:

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

 MR. KNEEDLER:

10

 Including taking? 
 no.  That  that  that, 

I think, that is the lesson of Monsanto 

6

8

No 

Well 
 which I think  which I 

think 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 it's an unconstitutional 

condition, isn't it? 

11

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  That 
Taking without just 

13

compensation would be an unconstitutional condition for 

14

putting something into the stream of  stream of 

15

commerce. 

16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

But  but it  it  that 

17

analysis would apply if there was a taking on the  on 

18

the Nollan/Dolan analogy, for example, if what 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is there any  is there any 

20

limit to that argument?  There are some examples in the 

21

briefs that are pretty startling.  Could the government 

22

say to a manufacturer of cellphones, you can sell 

23

cellphones; however, every fifth one you have to give to 

24

us?  Or a manufacturer of cars, you can sell cars in the 

25

United States, but every third car you have to give to

the  to the United States. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I  I think that would 

present a very different question. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why would it be  why would 

it be different? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Because  because this is 

7

this is part of a comprehensive regulatory program that 

8

if  that  it  it isn't just acquiring it.  It's, 

9

in fact 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, sure.  This would 

be 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So  so you  so you say 

13

if the government took all GM's cars, then it would be 

14

okay? 

15

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

17

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

18
19

No. 
But just not a third? 
No, no.  We are not saying 

that at all.  And if  if I  if I could just 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but just 

20

before you do, I mean, the  the rationale  I mean, 

21

the government can come up with a rationale to justify 

22

those examples really easily. 

23

 You say cellphone providers benefit greatly 

24

if there's a broader cellphone market, if more people 

25

are using them.  So we're going to take every fifth one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

and give it to people who might otherwise not be able to 

2

afford a cellphone.  And that will help cellphone 

3

manufacturers , because more and more people will 

4

have them.  More and more people will want them. 

5

Therefore, it's okay. 

6

 That's the same rationale you're applying 

7

here.  This is for the good of the people whose property 

8

we're taking. 

9

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, it  the  these 

10

programs go back to the 1930s, when the agricultural 

11

industry in this country was in serious trouble.  And 

12

particularly in California, prices were below costs 

13

of  of production, and 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And you can do what 

15

you've done in most other marketing orders, which is not 

16

take their raisins.  Instead, say, look, you can only 

17

plant, you know, 63 percent of your acreage this year, 

18

or you can only produce, you know, 28 tons.  That's how 

19

most of them work, and most of the them thereby are, I 

20

presume, analyzed under Penn Central. 

21

 This is different. 

This is different 

22

because you come up with the truck and you get the 

23

shovels and you take their raisins, probably in the dark 

24

of night. 

25

 (Laughter.)

Alderson Reporting Company

31

3

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

No, that  that is not 

what  that is not what the government does. 
 The  the way  the way the order operates 

4

is that the producer submits the raisins to the handler. 

5

The handler then divides them into two categories.  The 

6

handler is required by the order to maintain and 

7

separate the reserve raisins, but they are separated for 

8

later sale.  They are  they  they don't go to the 

9

government.  They don't  they are separated for later 

10
11

sale.  The proceeds are pooled 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They  they  what do you 

12

mean, they don't go to the  does not the government 

13

own them?  Do  do you deny that the government owns 

14

them? 

15
16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 
for purposes of this 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

 MR. KNEEDLER:

For  for these purposes 

Do 
 case, we concede that the 

government gets legal title. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well 
But that doesn't mean  that 

22

doesn't mean that the government has to entire interest 

23

in the  in the raisins. 

24
25

 They  the government has legal title so 
that it may  we will assume for purposes of this case,

so that  that they  the government can  or the 

2

the committee  it's not the Secretary of 

3

Agriculture  the committee can then sell the raisins. 

4

The proceeds of those sales are pooled and distributed 

5

back to the producers.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How  how many  how 

7

many  how much from those sales did  did these 

8

Petitioners acquire in the two years at issue here?

12

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, in  in

In  in one year there was 

13

$272 per ton.  In the other year there was  there were 

14

no proceeds back because the

 because the cost of

administering the reserve program exceeded  or there

So you 
Over the 
Sorry. 
Over the history of the 

program  it starts in 1949, right? 

24

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
And so in how many years

Alderson Reporting Company

33
1

while the program is in effect was there a distribution 

2

to the  to the growers? 

3

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I  I do not know that, how 

4

many years, but a great number of years.  And, in fact, 

5

the  the three years leading up to the  to this 

6

particular time, well one of the years here was $47 

7

million was returned.  In the prior years it was 

8

50some million and  and another 30some million. 

9

So in  the experience has been that there typically 

10

has been something returned. 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Kneedler, I, too, am 

12

troubled, like Justice Alito, about his every fifth 

13

telephone or whatever.  Every fifth car or every fifth 

14

telephone you have to give to the government.  You  I 

15

don't know you've answered that question.  Is that a 

16

taking or isn't it?  And 

17

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

23

25

And 
I 
 what's the basis to 

distinguish 

22

24

I 

It is not part of 
 distinguish it  it 

from 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Because this is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

comprehensive governmental program, and  and it  it 

2

governs quality, it governs timing of sales, and it's 

3

important to recognize that's all that is going on here. 

4

The reserve raisins are set aside by the handler.  After 

5

the producer has voluntarily turned them over, they're 

6

set aside by the handler for later sale. 

7

 Petitioners concede in their brief at page 

8

23 that the government can regulate the when, the 

9

manner, and the channel of sales.  That's exactly what 

10

the reserve program does.  They're turned over to the 

11

handler.  The handler sets them aside in reserve. 

12

The 

13
14
15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. Kneedler, 

this 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

 committee then decides 

16

when and where to sell them. 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

This  this is a 

18

a historical quirk that you have to defend.  You could 

19

achieve your  the government's objectives, just as you 

20

do in most other cases, through volume limitations that 

21

don't require a physical taking. 

22

 For whatever reason, in the history of the 

23

New Deal, this one was set up differently.  And so we're 

24

here dealing with a classical, physical taking.  We are 

25

not going to jeopardize the marketing  the Agriculture

 And by the way, it better be the Department

of Agriculture that takes these  you said earlier it's

5

of trouble in your government speech cases, where you 

6

always make the point that these committees are, in 

7

fact, the government.

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

We're not  we're not saying 

9

the committee is not the government.  What I was saying 

10

is that the  that the operation of the program is not 

11

for the government's benefit.  It is for the producers' 

12

benefit. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Correct , correct.  So 
It was 
 therefore, what is 
 adopted by producers. 

17

JUSTICE BREYER:  Look  look.  This is  I'm having 

18

trouble with the same thing.  I agree so far with what 

19

the Chief Justice said. 

20

 Go back to the New Deal. 

You can, in fact, 

21

burn raisins, the point of which was to have fewer 

22

raisins, the result of which was to raise the price of 

23

raisins from $100 a pound to  or a bushel  to 400. 

24

That was thought to make the farmer better off, which it 

25

did.  And it made the customers worse off.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36

 Then someone had a good idea and said it's 

2

sort of wasteful to burn raisins.  Let's take the 

3

raisins we'd otherwise burn and give them to 

4

schoolchildren.  And maybe we could even sell a few, and 

5

if we do, we'll give that extra money to the farmer, 

6

too. 

7

 Now we have schoolchildren with raisins. 

We 

8

have the farmer having more money.  Sounds like a pretty 

9

good program.  Of course, you have taken some raisins. 

10

 But what I don't see is how either the 

11

farmer or the schoolchildren are any the worse off.  And 

12

if they're no worse off, what compensation are these 

13

farmers entitled to? 

14

 Of course, free riders could become yet 

15

better off.  They could charge at the higher price that 

16

the program creates, $800.  But, after all, that isn't 

17

the issue because you have to have, as a rule, no free 

18

riders.  And once you admit that as a rule, everyone, 

19

including perhaps these plaintiffs, are better off than 

20

none at all. 

21

 Now, that's a very simple argument. 

It's 

22

what I understand to be the economics of the Brannan 

23

Plan, the FDR, the 1949, et cetera.  And yet, we've had 

24

endless cases, complexities, opinions, and fines. 

25

And  and so, therefore, I'm probably wrong with my

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

simple argument.  Of course, I doubt that I'm wrong, but 

2

nonetheless, I want you to explain what's wrong with it. 

3

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

We agree with much of what 

4

you said, except that it is not  I  I just 

5

reiterated  it is not a taking of the raisins. 

6
7
8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If you want to say it's not 

a taking 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

No, it  no.  It's a  it 

is a regulatory program classically analyzed under Penn 

10

Central because there is a reciprocity of  of 

11

advantage  one of the phrases this Court has 

12

frequently used  among producers.  This does not 

13

distinctly affect the Petitioners.  It applies to all 

14

producers.  If Petitioners are correct, since 1949, 

15

every year there has been a reserve requirement, every 

16

producer has had a per se taking. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr.  Mr. Kneedler, if  I 

18

largely agree with what the Chief Justice said.  I mean, 

19

just the way I think about this program is that this 

20

does seem a weird historical anomaly. 

21

 And all  am I right that all the rest of 

22

these agricultural programs are done differently, such 

23

that saying that this was a taking would not affect 

24

other agricultural programs?  And  and also, are there 

25

any other programs out there  forget agricultural

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

programs  but are there any other programs out there 

2

that we should be concerned about if we were to think 

3

about this as a taking? 

4

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, I  with respect to 

5

agricultural programs, I  I think there are eight or 

6

ten other programs that have reserve provisions in them. 

7

 I  I think most of those are not active in 

8

the sense that there is currently reserve, just like 

9

this one is not.  And if  if this one has outlived its 

10

usefulness and the committee has not proposed a reserve 

11

requirement, the program is working exactly like it 

12

should.  The committee, which is responsible, has 

13

decided not to impose a reserve requirement. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I  I'm sorry.  But you 

15

said that there were eight or ten other programs that, 

16

you said, they have 

17

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Have  have  they  they 

18

have, like this one, provisions permitting the use of a 

19

reserve system, but like  like this one, they are not 

20

actively utilizing it. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24
25

How long 
Any 
 have they not been 

actively utilized? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I think it  I think most of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

this has been in the last decade.  I don't know  I 

2

don't know precisely. 

3

 But  and one of the things that's happened 

4

in the  in this industry in the last 10 years is it 

5

has changed greatly.  You will see from the amicus brief 

6

filed by SunMaid and the  and the Raisin Bargaining 

7

Association, which I commend to your attention, they now 

8

believe that the reserve requirement should no longer 

9

be  or at least SunMaid does  should no longer be 

10

instituted.  But they also firmly believe that 

11

Petitioners should not be permitted to be free riders on 

12

this program. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

14

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

15
16

And  and what if 
They weren't able to sell the 

raisins 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And  and Mr. Kneedler, 

17

what of the nonagricultural programs?  Are there 

18

regulatory programs where the government says, produce 

19

something that is characterizable as property? 

20

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, the  I think the most 

21

immediately relevant one, which this Court sustained, 

22

was in  in the Monsanto case where you were asking 

23

about records and information.  That was a case in 

24

which, as a condition for marketing pesticides, the 

25

manufacturer had to submit information to EPA.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40

2
3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right.  But we  we know 

about that one.  Anything else out there? 
 I mean, tell me what the  the realm of 

4

regulatory programs is that we ought to be concerned 

5

about if we were to say something like the production of 

6

something  the production of stuff that somebody 

7

claims a property interest in is a taking. 

8
9

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I'm  I'm not specifically 

aware of other programs but Monsanto, and the 

10

requirement to submit information to the government, for 

11

example, is  is  is widespread in  in our society. 

12

And what the Court basically said there was that if it 

13

was known when someone  before they entered commerce 

14

and  and applied their application, if they knew that 

15

the material would be disclosed to the public or used by 

16

the government for approving other applications, there 

17

was no taking. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Or I  I  look 
Well, I guess the 

20

government can prohibit the  the introduction of 

21

harmful pesticides into interstate commerce.  I'm not 

22

sure it can prohibit the introduction of raisins. 

23

 I mean, that's a  you know, dangerous 

24
25

raisins. 
 (Laughter.)

Alderson Reporting Company

41
1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I  I can understand 

2

imposing that condition on Monsanto, and that would not 

3

be an unconstitutional condition. 

4

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

you impose it on raisins. 

7

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, that  that was not 
It seems to me it is when 

Well, the  the  the 

8

Court's rationale in Monsanto was not based on the fact 

9

that it was  that it was  that the product was 

10

dangerous, although, that was obviously the setting.  It 

11

was the fact that the  that the manufacturer knew, 

12

when submitting the information to  to EPA, that it 

13

would be subject to disclosure, and, therefore, its 

14

property value, either eliminated or appropriated by the 

15

government, as it were, for use in evaluating other 

16

applications. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER : 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

This is not 
Well, but what you 

19

take from Monsanto, and look at your brief on page 32 

20

when you cite Monsanto, you say that producers who are 

21

dissatisfied with the reserve regulations may plant 

22

different crops. 

23

 That's a pretty audacious statement. 

24

don't like our regulations, do something else. 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

If you 

Well  or that's not the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42

only option that they have.  They have the option of 

2

selling the grapes for other purposes.  These  the 

3
4
5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What, you mean 

you mean wine? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Wine or  or  or grape 

6

juice.  These are  these are  these grapes  the 

7

overwhelming majority of them  the Thompson seedless 

8

grapes are  have a variety of uses, and that's 

9

that's one of the things that a grower would take into 

10

account, is would they be better off 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But normally 

 with raisins or 
 normally what we 

14

say, if you don't like regulations, you can challenge 

15

them in court to see if they comply with the 

16

Constitution.  The answer  I mean, if the answer is 

17

always you can do something else, it would seem we 

18

should  we'll never have these kinds of cases. 

19

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

No.  But  but this is a 

20

substantive point I'm making, not a preclusion of review 

21

point. 

22

 The substantive point is that there is 

23

market regulation.  People who are growing crops in this 

24

industry know what the regulation is, and if they 

25

decide  and then the Hornes here have operated under

Alderson Reporting Company

43

this Marketing Order for 30 years before they  before 

2

they challenged it.

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10
11

All that's true 
It seems 
 but they brought their 

claim. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems to me what your 

argument 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry.  Justice 

Kennedy. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems to me what your 

12

argument is saying, is even if it's a taking, it's okay. 

13

It will be okay.  Everything will work out.  That's what 

14

I get from your argument. 

15

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

No.  Our  our  our 

16

argument  our fundamental argument is that it is not a 

17

taking to begin with because the  the grower 

18

voluntarily submits the total amount of its raisins to 

19

the handler.  The handler then separates them into 

20

into two quarters, one to be sold now and one to be sold 

21

later.  But they both have to do with the timing and 

22

regulation of sale, which Petitioners acknowledge the 

23

government can regulate the timing and manner of sales. 

24

That's exactly what happens here. 

25

 There are basically two markets. 

Alderson Reporting Company

One is the

Official

44
1

free market.  The other is the tightly regulated market 

2

for exports, for other outlets that do not compete with 

3

the domestic market. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So if you don't 

5

like  we're going to say the Pledge of Allegiance in 

6

public schools, and we're going to make everybody stand. 

7

And if you don't like it, go to a different school.  I 

8

don't understand why that's not the same analysis here. 

9

 We may be taking  you know, this may be a 

10

taking of your raisins or not, but if  and if you 

11

don't like it, grow something else. 

12

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, Monsanto is not the 

13

only case where that was  by the way, I  I do not 

14

believe that Nollan cut back on  on the rationale of 

15

Monsanto.  What the footnote in Nollan said is, we do 

16

not regard the ability to build on your property  your 

17

real property to build a house as a  as a governmental 

18

benefit.  It did not say  in fact, I think it 

19

reaffirmed the idea that there was an exchange in 

20

Monsanto where the government was giving a benefit of 

21

clearing the product for use. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Where  where  whereas, 

23

you say that introducing raisins into interstate 

24

commerce is a government benefit, right? 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

We  we think the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

regulation  the  the regulatory program is a 

2

governmental benefit. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  No, not the 

4

regulatory.  You're saying the activity, which is 

5

subjected to this taking, is the introduction of raisins 

6

in interstate commerce.  And you say that is something 

7

that the benign government can give or withhold. 

8

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10
11

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

It is.  It is 
Right? 
It is  it is the permission 

to do it, which is 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Really? 
 exactly what the Court 

14

said in Monsanto.  But Monsanto is not the only case. 

15

Yee said the same thing with respect to the  to real 

16

property.  That was the case involving the mobile home 

17

park.  And it was claimed there was a taking there 

18

because the mobile park owner was subject to rent 

19

control and  and it was argued that that was just like 

20

Loretto because it was a forced physical occupation. 

21

 And the Court said no. 

The critical 

22

distinction was that the  the Yees had voluntarily 

23

chosen to enter the rental market, to enter into a 

24

commercial transaction, and the government could then, 

25

because they had voluntarily had done it, regulate the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1
2

price that was being charged. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Mr. McConnell was asked a 

3

number of questions about the Leonard case.  But I take 

4

it that you don't think that the Leonard case has a very 

5

important bearing on this case because you cite it one 

6

time in your brief, it's a passing reference, on the 

7

issue of fungible goods.  Am I correct there? 

8
9
10
11

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

We  we think it's a 

critical point.  But we are  we are not  we are not 
arguing 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You don't think  you 

12

didn't propose  you didn't suggest to us that this 

13

case is just another version of Leonard and, therefore, 

14

we should affirm based on Leonard. 

15

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

To the extent Leonard was 

16

about tax, this  this was not  this program was not 

17

identified as a tax partly because the raisins don't 

18

come to the government.  The raisins are  go into a 

19

pool that belongs to all of the producers and then is 

20

divided up among the producers.  This is not  these 

21

are not things that are appropriated for the 

22

government's own use.  But we think Leonard is  is 

23

critically instructive for the point that with respect 

24

to property like this, like the oyster shells or like 

25

raisins, there  what the Court said is that they are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

fungible, their only value is for commercial sale. 

2

 This is not like the ownership of real 

3

property in Loretto where  which is unique and 

4

personally identified.  These raisins are valuable only 

5

for sale.  And, in fact, as I said, this order kicks in 

6

only when the producer has committed the raisins to 

7

sale. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

10
11

So  so put all 
 by handing them to a 

handler. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Put all the regulatory 

12

aspects of the program aside for a moment, and just say 

13

this were a much simpler program, and it said  the 

14

government says to the raisin industry, you know, we 

15

could tax you, and say you have to deliver 2 percent of 

16

your net profits, we're not going to do that, we're just 

17

going to take 2 percent of your raisins. 

18

 Would that be constitutional? 

19
20

Would that be 

a taking? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

That would  that would be, 

21

I think, like Leonard.  It would be  it would be a 

22

an inkind tax.  I  I don't think there's anything 

23

that would prohibit that being done, but that's not  I 

24

mean  and we think the fact that that would be okay 

25

is  is instructive here, as the Court's discussion of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

Leonard suggests, but the Court doesn't have to get to 

2

that point. 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But you said you don't think 

of this case in that way.  And why don't you? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, it's analogous in the 

6

sense that  that  that Congress may well be able to 

7

do this in a different way.  My  the reason I said it 

8

was different is that the  that the oysters  that 

9

the raisins, excuse me, are not being used for the 

10

government's program, they do not go to school lunch 

11

programs.  If the government wants raisins, it buys 

12

them.  It doesn't  it doesn't 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.  But we  we don't 

14

usually allow committees of producers who are called the 

15

government to impose taxes, do we?  I mean, that's 

16

usually done by Congress. 

17

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

done by some committee. 

20

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

21
22

Or  or 
And this essentially is 

Right, but it's a committee 

elected by producers, it's important to recognize. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It may well be.  So  so 

23

they can impose taxes, you're saying.  This is just like 

24

a tax. 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

No.  What I  what I was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

saying is it  there are other  the government may 

2

well be able to impose something  some exaction as a 

3

tax, but this is a regulatory program adopted by 

4

producers.  Again, it's important to recognize, and this 

5

goes back to the New Deal.  This Court has had numerous 

6

cases involving these marketing orders. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Whatever a majority of 

8

producers agree to, I have to be bound by?  I mean, 

9

these people disagree. 

10

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

They do  they do disagree, 

11

but the disagreement does not convert it into a taking. 

12

And if  if they believe the program is not operating 

13

correctly, then there are  there are other 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm not saying the 

15

disagreement converts it into a taking.  I'm just saying 

16

that it doesn't  it doesn't carry much water to say 

17

that this is a program adopted by  by producers.  If 

18

51 percent of the producers want to do it, there's 49 

19

that don't want to do it. 

20

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, I think it's a  it's 

21

a pretty good indication that  that the premises on 

22

which Congress enacted this statute in 1937 operated 

23

then and operate  operate now for the benefit of 

24

producers.  And it shouldn't be necessary in any one 

25

particular year in which the regulatory program is in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

place to calibrate whether the benefits outweigh the 

2

burdens.  I think 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Central planning was 

4

thought to work very well in 1937, and Russia tried it 

5

for a long time. 

6

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, if  again, if this 

7

program is  is not working, it can be modified.  And, 

8

in fact, the committee comprised of producers has 

9

decided not to impose a reserve requirement in some 

10
11

years. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but what if 

12

I mean, you've  you've made the point several times 

13

that the government sells these raisins for the benefit 

14

of the producers, right? 

15

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right. 
Well, what if the 

17

producers, some of them, think they can do a better job 

18

of selling them?  They can get a better price because 

19

they're better producers, they're better marketers, they 

20

have export contacts that others don't.  I 

21

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

The  this is just standard 

22

regulation.  What Congress has said is you  if you're 

23

going to sell, you have to sell in the manner set up 

24

under this program.  And the  the portion that they 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, but that's not

Official

51
1

usually  when you're talking about that type of 

2

regulation, I understand that, you know, the raisins 

3

have to be so big or you can't call them raisins, and 

4

they've  you've got to have safety inspections and 

5

all.  But you've been presenting this as the reason this 

6

is a good program is because we sell the raisins, and 

7

then we give some of what's left to the  to the 

8

producers.  I don't think that's a very common approach 

9

to market regulation. 

10

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, there  there are 

11

there are two pools of raisins, and  and how you 

12

how you treat, or how you implement the notion that 

13

there are two different pools of raisins may vary.  But 

14

the  but where you have that, the  the similarities 

15

are much more fundamental.  You have what  the 

16

freetonnage raisins, which are  which the grower is 

17

immediately paid for, and the handler can immediately 

18

put on the market, but there was a judgment made when 

19

this  when this  marketing order was established and 

20

SunMaid and  and the Raisin Association believed it 

21

was still true during these years, that if you  if you 

22

have a big surplus, as there was around the turn of the 

23

century, it would make the prices plummet if those extra 

24

raisins were put on the  on the open market because 

25

the demand for raisins is inelastic.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

 So what  what this marketing order does is 

2

it estimates  where it operates, it estimates what the 

3

freetonnage requirement will be.  And that is 

4

completely open to the market.  The reserve raisins, if 

5

you  they're  they're essentially valueless because 

6

you don't need them to satisfy the existing market.  You 

7

take them off the market to prop up the prices of the 

8

of the freetonnage raisins, and then the committee will 

9

sell them when they will not undermine  or in a manner 

10
11

that will not undermine the freetonnage sales. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Suppose the same sort of 

12

program were carried out with respect to real property. 

13

Would you  would you provide the same answers? 

14

Suppose that property owners, owners of real property in 

15

a particular area, think that the value of their 

16

property would be increased if they all surrendered a 

17

certain amount of that property to the government for 

18

the purpose of producing a  creating a park or for 

19

some other reason. 

20

 And so they  they get the municipality 

21

to  to set up this program, and one of them objects to 

22

surrendering this part of that person  of his or her 

23

land.  Would  would that not be a taking? 

24
25

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I think real property would 

be fundamentally different.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, why  why would it be

 I thought you said you're not arguing that there's a 

3

difference between real property and personal property. 

4

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

We're  we're not saying 

5

there's a categorical difference.  But I think  I 

6

think the Lucas decision is very instructive there, that 

7

when  when the Court was talking about the ability to 

8

regulate real property, it said that there's a big 

9

difference between real property and personal property, 

10

at least personal property being used for commercial 

11

purposes, which might even be rendered valueless by

virtue of governmental regulations.  So we think

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Kneedler, explain to me 

23

why  why  why the market for raisins is inelastic. 

24

You mean people won't buy more raisins if they're 

25

cheaper?

 MR. KNEEDLER:

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

That's basically correct. 
Really? 
It's just  it's just the 

4

quality of  it's just the quality of raisins.  And 

5

there  there's a limited set of outlets  raisins now 

6

are primarily used as  as food ingredients in Raisin

8

doesn't affect demand.  And  and, therefore, if you 

9

put a great surplus on the domestic market, the 

10

prices  prices will crater.  And so this  this has a 

11

very sensible approach. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Kneedler, you don't have 

13

to convince us that this is a sensible program for you 

14

to prevail, do you?

this is a ridiculous program; isn't that right?

No, we do not.  The 

Pardon?  I'm sorry. 
We could think that this is 

a ridiculous program. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

You could think this is a 

24

a ridiculous program, but it is one that has been around 

25

since 1949, and Petitioner's argument again means that

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Kneedler, I'd like to

It doesn't help your case 

5

that it's ridiculous, though.  You  you acknowledge

that.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I do not.

me be clear, a ridiculous program.  This is a

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But this is a serious point, 

14

actually, because the ridiculousness or sensibleness of 

15

a program is really not for us to decide. 

16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Yes, I  I  I agree with 

17

that completely.  I mean, that is our  this is a 

18

regulatory program and should be thought of under this 

19

Court's regulatory jurisprudence. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr.  Mr. Kneedler, you 

21

were asked this before, but your answer wasn't clear. 

22

Marketing orders of this sort that have a reserve pool, 

23

you said there were 8 or 10.  Have any others been 

24

operative as this one has been?  It was started in '49 

25

and how many years 

Alderson Reporting Company

They have been operative in

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

government selling the reserve? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I  I think it's  I think 

it's true of maybe several others, I'm not  I'm not 

10

sure.  Some of them have to do with the handler  the 

11

difference between the handler and producer.  I wanted 

12

to correct the fact 

13
14
15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

How many  oh, go 

ahead. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I wanted to correct a factual 

16

error on the computations.  There was suggestion in the 

17

one year there was  $810 was the field price, and 

18

because of the mathematical calculations, the claim was 

19

the Petitioners would have been better off without the 

20

reserve.  That's not correct.  The mistake there is the 

21

assumption that all the raisins would have been sold at 

22

the field price if they were all put on the market, and 

23

that's  that's just inconsistent with the premise of 

24

the order, that the only reason that there is a  a 

25

high field price for the freetonnage raisins is that

Alderson Reporting Company

57
1

the other ones are taken off the market.  So they would 

2

not have  they would not have been recovered in that 

3

way.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

of these programs are there?

How many  how many 

Of 
Marketing orders. 

I think there's scores of 

them. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I mean, I'm trying 

to put the 8 to 10 in  in relation to  to how many. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I don't know the total 

13

number, but I  we can follow that up with a 

14

supplemental letter.  I think  I think there are 

15

scores of them.  But this is not fundamentally different 

16

from the others.  And again, the government is not 

17

acquiring these raisins for itself.  The government 

18

doesn't actually keep them in its possession.  It just 

19

tells the handler to keep them and sell them later, 

20

rather than selling them now, and that is not an 

21

appropriation of private property.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58

2
3
4

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 
 So several things have been cleared up. 

The 

5

government now does concede that the government takes 

6

legal title to the raisins.  The government does abjure 

7

an argument on tax. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Happens with trustees 

all the time, to the extent that we've eschewed taking 

10

formal titles as meaningful with respect to actual 

11

control or actual benefit.  We  trustees take title 

12

and  but it's not for their benefit.  It's for the 

13

benefit of their beneficiary. 

14

 MR. McCONNELL: 

The  that's true, Justice 

15

Sotomayor, but the taking  the government is not a 

16

trustee here.  And the 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Oh, but in a form, yes. 

18

It's directed to sell the reserve raisins at the best 

19

price it can get, given the limitations on the free 

20

market. 

21

 MR. McCONNELL: 

It sells for the best price 

22

and then it uses the proceeds for its own regulatory 

23

purpose. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You  you have only four 

minutes in rebuttal.  You had some other points?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Just as to the factual 

2

point, it is not  our  our calculations are not 

3

based upon selling all of the raisins at the field 

4

price.  Our calculations are based upon being able to 

5

sell all of the raisins at the price that the Secretary 

6

has said would be the price in an unregulated market, 

7

which is $747 per ton.  And that is  it is certainly 

8

not true that these reserve raisins are valueless.  They 

9

are an extremely valuable commodity, and in most of the 

10

years, the producers of the raisins receive absolutely 

11

nothing for them. 

12

 The important point here, though, is that 

13

is that it is not any less of a taking, even if there is 

14

a benefit.  I have no doubt, for example, that in 

15

Loretto, that the value of the apartment went up because 

16

there was a cable, because it became cable ready for 

17

its  for its tenants.  That did not make it any less 

18

of a taking, as this is a per se taking, and any 

19

benefits only go to whether there might be some kind of 

20

implicit inkind compensation as a result of the 

21

benefit. 

22

 And if this were an eminent domain 

23

proceeding, I think that that might well be relevant. 

24

This is, in fact, only an administrative enforcement 

25

action in which the question is whether the Department

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

of Agriculture was entitled, under the Constitution, to 

2

demand either the raisins or their monetary equivalent 

3

without any payment of  of  of compensation. 

4
5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

isn't it for them to make that argument? 

6

 MR. McCONNELL: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8
9
10
11
12

That last  what  why 

Because 
The argument, you know, 

that it's  you're better off, et cetera. 
 MR. McCONNELL: 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If you would look at the 
Did they waive it?  I mean, 

what's  what's  what's the answer? 
 MR. McCONNELL: 

No, it's the regulation. 

13

I'm  I'm sorry.  If you look at 7 C.F.R. 989.166(c), 

14

you will see that that is the provision for what happens 

15

when the handler does not turn over reserve raisins to 

16

the Department of Agriculture.  It is  it has very 

17

specific provisions for what happens, and there is no 

18

provision in that for implicit inkind compensation. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But  can they argue 

20

that  the fact that all the raisin producers are 

21

better off because of this program, including you, but 

22

no free riders, that's what's the compensation.  Can 

23

they at least argue that?  Or have they conceded that? 

24
25

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Under this regulation, I do 

not think it is open to the Department of Agriculture to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

61
1

argue that.  I think that that would be a logical 

2

argument if this were an eminent domain proceeding and 

3

we were simply trying to figure out what the proper 

4

value of the raisins is. 

5

 Reserving, of course, the point that we 

6

believe that this program does not benefit the 

7

producers. 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

 MR. McCONNELL: 

Yes, yes. 
We believe that the  we 

10

believe that this program actually makes the producers 

11

demonstrably worse off.  The only people who benefit 

12

from this program are the recipients of the subsidy 

13

of the export subsidies. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

 MR. McCONNELL: 

That's right. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. McConnell, could I take 

The exporters. 

17

you back to the very first thing that you said in this 

18

argument?  Because you said typically, the handler 

19

doesn't take the product and the handler doesn't pay for 

20

the product, and you would think that the Hornes here 

21

would only have a takings claim, assuming that they do 

22

have a takings claim, for the raisins that they produced 

23

and not for the raisins that other people produced.  But 

24

you said that that's not correct in this case? 

25

 MR. McCONNELL: 

It is not, because they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

62
1

pay  the  a check went out from the Raisin Marketing 

2

Association to the producers for every raisin, not just 

3

the  the freetonnage raisins, but for the 

4

reservetonnage raisins as well.  So the Hornes are 

5

actually the  the only people with a financial 

6

interest in the raisins in this case.  That is unusual. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. McConnell, this 

8

is probably neither here nor there, but what has the 

9

impact of the drought been on the raisin producers?  Do 

10

you know?

response.
