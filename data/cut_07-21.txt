CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

County Election Board and Indiana Democratic Party v.

Secretary Rokita.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves a law that directly

13

burdens our most fundamental right, the right to vote.

14

Those Indiana voters who lack the identification now

15

required by the new photo ID law must overcome

16

substantial practical and financial burdens before they

17

can continue to exercise their constitutional right.

18

Now, the State says that those burdens are justified by

19

the need to stamp out the scourge of voter impersonation

20

fraud at the polls, but this Court has made clear many

21

times that such a justification should not just be

22

accepted at face value, but instead it should be

23

scrutinized to assure that the claimed State interest is

24

both real and sufficiently weighty to justify the burden

25

being imposed on constitutional rights.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Before -- before we get to

2

that, can we talk about standing a little?

3

the -- who are the complainants here?

4

MR. SMITH:

Who are

There are many plaintiffs, Your

5

Honor, including the ones that the courts below found

6

have standing, the Democratic Party.

7
8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Courts below are sometimes

wrong.

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor, absolutely, and

10

especially when I'm a petitioner I agree with you on

11

that.

12

Party was found to have standing correctly, I believe,

13

on at least two grounds, associational standing as well

14

as what you might call haven standing, the

15

organizational interest being impaired by virtue of this

16

law.

17

But in this case, Your Honor, the Democratic

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, they still have to

18

identify individuals who are members.

19

take to be a member of the Democratic Party here?

MR. SMITH:

Now, what does it

Your Honor, in Indiana you

become a member of the Democratic Party by participating

in party affairs.

activists, who are poll workers, and that's why the

24

district court said that as, as to the equal protection

25

claim those people were sufficient to satisfy

They did identify members who are

5

Alderson Reporting Company

associational standing.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought -- I thought they

3

took the position that anybody who voted or intended to

4

vote Democratic is a member of the Democratic Party.

5

MR. SMITH:

Well, there are different

6

degrees of membership, different ways to become a

7

member, as this Court has recognized -

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Is there any way in which

you can say -- and I thought this was the theory of

10

associational standing -- that this individual has

11

voluntarily given this organization the right to

12

represent that person for particular purposes?

13

MR. SMITH:

There is no formal method of

14

induction as you would have in the Elk's Club or

15

something, Your Honor.

16

which you become a participant in the affairs of the

17

party.

18

aver that you have either supported Democratic

19

candidates in the last election or intend to in a future

20

election.

21

But there clearly are methods by

For example, to vote in the primary you have to

But that doesn't mean that

22

I'm willing to have the Democratic Party represent me

23

for all sorts of purposes.

questioning their ability to do it.

And these people can bring
I mean, I'm not

6

Alderson Reporting Company

But, but why is the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Democratic Party their representative?

2

MR. SMITH:

Because they have -- the

3

Democratic Party is an association of people joined

4

together to elect candidates of a particular kind and

5

those people include many people who are burdened by

6

this law.

7

quintessential case for associational standing, Your

8

Honor.

9

This seems to be the absolutely

JUSTICE SOUTER:

As I understand it, though,

10

Mr. Smith, the trial court didn't rely on, simply on the

11

associational standing of the Democratic Party, did it?

12

MR. SMITH:

No, that's correct, Your Honor.

13

Well, the court of appeals relied as well on Havens

14

Realty and said that the organizational interests of the

15

party are being impaired by virtue of the fact that this

16

is putting a burden on them achieving their goal, the

17

Democratic Party's goal, of electing its candidates.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

them to get people properly identified.

20

MR. SMITH:

And is doing so by forcing

Extend resources getting people,

21

get their identification.

It's very much like the

22

Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority case which we

23

cited in our brief, which involved a nonprofit

24

organization aimed at trying to keep the noise level

25

down at National Airport that was impaired by an

Official - Subject to Final Review

unconstitutional statute in that case as well.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:
members.

I mean, you did join that organization.

4

MR. SMITH:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

That organization had

Well, Your Honor And they identified members

who would be, who would be annoyed by the noise.

7

MR. SMITH:

I'd note, Your Honor, that in

8

the Hunt case itself there were no members.

9

said it doesn't really matter because the State agency

10

that had associational standing in Hunt functioned for

11

all purposes as the representatives of those, of those

12

apple farmers, but there was no formal membership

13

organization, no members per se at all.

14

said that shouldn't make a difference because there's

15

really no actual functional difference between the two

16

situations.

17

The Court

But the Court

I would certainly submit JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just think it's hard to

18

confine your rationale if you say that any association

19

could sue.

20

if they knew what we were doing, if they knew this

21

problem they would really want us to sue on their

22

behalf, I don't know if I'm going to confine your

23

rationale.

24
25

If it says, you know, there are people that

MR. SMITH:

Well Your Honor, the thing that

confines the rationale is it has to be something that
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

relates as well to the purpose of the organization, of

2

the association, the reason why these people are bound

3

together as a group, and that is of course to get people

4

to vote and vote to support -- support the goals of the

5

organization, support the candidates, the nominees of

6

the organization.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We can limit your

8

standing argument to -- I guess it's based on the

9

affidavits of Ms. Holland and Ms. Smith, the one who is

10

a clerk for the Democratic Party and the other who is a

11

judge for the Democratic Party.

12

with you that anybody who votes, might vote Democratic,

13

is enough to give you standing.

14

MR. SMITH:

We don't have to agree

But we also have other people in

15

the record, Your Honor -- for example, Theresa Clemente,

16

others who are active poll workers, activists in the

17

party, who -- had been polled and found that they didn't

18

have IDs and that they would be burdened by the

19

difficulty of getting IDs.

20

specific standing evidence in there of specific people

21

who, much more than just your average voter, are active

22

in party affairs.

23

card-carrying members of the Democratic Party, but they

24

are as much a part of the Democratic Party as anybody

25

possibly could be, who were identified in response to

So that that -- there is

They may not have a -- be

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interrogatories, about 9 or 10 of them, and were found

2

to be satisfactory for purposes of standing by the

3

district court on the equal protection claim.

4

Now, in addition I would note as I suggested

5

to Justice Souter, you don't have to go to the

6

associational standing because the Democratic Party

7

clearly is injured in its own right as an organization.

8
9

Now, if I could turn to the merits then, the
--

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Even in its own

11

right, it has to identify somebody that's a member or

12

not.

13

MR. SMITH:

No.

When it's in its own right

14

the association, the organization, is injured, Your

15

Honor.

16

is there enough evidence here that people are actually

17

being prevented from voting?

18

Now, the question -- if what you're suggesting,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

particular, I suppose.

20

MR. SMITH:

Exactly, Democrats in

A great deal of evidence in the

21

record of the burdens that are imposed on people who try

22

to comply with this law and continue exercising their

23

constitutional right to vote.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I understood

Judge Barker to say that you had not come up with a
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

single instance of somebody who was denied the right to

2

vote because they didn't have a photo ID.

3

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, the record in

4

this case was made when an election had not yet

5

happened.

6

I don't quite understand its significance.

7

was brought to try to prevent an irreparable loss of

8

constitutional rights in advance of the implementation

9

of this law.

10

This case

I think it had been used in two little

towns in '05, Montezuma, Indiana, but other than that -

11
12

So that comment, while it was certainly made,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So elections were

conducted under this law?

13

MR. SMITH:

I'm not even -- there were a

14

couple of hundred people that had voted under the law,

15

but nobody else had yet, at that point.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, the -

Well, did you have anybody

17

who said, I don't have a voter ID?

18

MR. SMITH:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, we did, Your Honor.
I plan to come in this next

20

election, I plan to vote, and I don't have a voter ID

21

card?

22

MR. SMITH:

Yes, we did, Your Honor.

That's

23

the 9 or 10 people who came from the poll worker survey.

24

There was also a considerable amount of testimony about

25

other people who said they wanted to vote, who spoke to
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

many of the other plaintiffs, Mr. Crawford, the NAACP

2

chapter.

3

submitted evidence of people saying:

4

5

to be able to vote.

There's a lot of other plaintiffs who also

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't have an

But why -- and

7

they're not going to be able to get one even though the

8

State will provide them with one if they don't have one,

9

subject to some identification?

10

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

But what the

11

State did in 2002 was it ratcheted up the difficulty of

12

getting one by requiring for the first time that you

13

have an original certified birth certificate that you

14

paid for and that -- and then you have to go through the

15

hoops of what kind of identification you need for that.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, is it your position

17

that a State can't require any form of identification

18

and can only require a signature, or would some lesser

19

form of identification than Indiana has required be

20

constitutional?

21

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, it may well be

22

possible that there's certain situations that it could

23

require it.

24

Court said in Timmons, you have to make hard judgments

25

on the specific facts of each case and identify both the

2

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

What was the answer to my

4

question?

5

signature permissible or not?

6

Is any form of voter identification beyond a

MR. SMITH:

If it's readily available and

7

not especially burdensome and there is some reason to

8

think that it is preventing a fraud of some sort,

9

serving some -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But clearly you answer all

11

of those questions that you've just posed, that you've

12

just responded with, "no".

13

Justice Alito should be no.

So then your answer to

14

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, it is true -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Although that leads to the

16

next question, is whether or not there are ways in which

17

the -- the central purpose of this law can be preserved

18

but it could be less stringent.

19

respond to both of those things.

20

MR. SMITH:

But I'd like you to

Well, it is certainly true that,

21

in fact, there is no evidence in this record of any

22

significant amount of fraud that is still occurring with

23

the existing system of voter identification.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That wasn't -- that wasn't

the problem I had with your answer to that question.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

You posed a number of questions to Justice Alito, or a

2

number of responses, but to each one of those your own

3

answer in the brief was no, and therefore your question

4

-- the answer to Justice Alito's question should be no,

5

there is no system that you know of that can impose a

6

photo ID.

7

MR. SMITH:

I think -- I think that the

8

current system works just fine.

So if there's any

9

degree of burden being imposed on the voter by some

10

additional identification requirement, then I would say

11

it's unconstitutional.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. SMITH:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Smith Your answer is no.

Yes, Your Honor.
-- suppose at the time of

16

registration there was a photograph taken right in the

17

registration place and on the spot they gave you an ID

18

with that photo, and everybody who registers would get

19

one and there isn't any question of paying money to get

20

a birth certificate.

21

that -- if you could make a photographic ID universally

22

available, you would still have the problem of the

23

religious objectors, but wouldn't everybody else be

24

covered?

25

MR. SMITH:

Would that be satisfactory?

Ir

If you had a world in which that
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

were true, Your Honor, I think that would be potentially

2

constitutional.

3

one we live in, and -

4
5

That's a very different world than the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
potentially constitutional?

6

MR. SMITH:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

That would be

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

So we should

ignore your religious objection argument in this case?

9

MR. SMITH:

Well, I was assuming that we

10

would make some additional exemptions for particular

11

people with those kinds of problems, if people can't

12

have one.

13

ID in their pocket is it constitutional to require them

14

to show them at the voting booth, the answer to that I

15

think is yes.

16

If the question is, if everybody has a photo

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, do we know that that

17

religious exemption won't be made?

18

MR. SMITH:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me, Your Honor?
Do we know that that

20

religious exemption won't be made?

21

it.

22

MR. SMITH:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Nobody's asserted

No, I'm not -- I'm not No, no.

I mean in this

24

case.

In this case you're claiming there's a problem

25

for people who, for religious reasons, don't want to
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have their photograph taken.

Do we know that if that's

2

the reason that they assert, I can't get the photograph,

3

the State will say you can't vote?

4

MR. SMITH:

I must be misunderstanding.

We

5

have every reason to think that they will let them vote.

6

The only problem with that exemption, like the indigency

7

exception, is that it's kind of gratuitively burdensome

8

in that you have to go down to the county seat to vote

9

every time; you can't vote in your polling place because

10

you have to fill out this affidavit every time you vote.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you could, you could

12

do it twice.

13

14

You could make the two trips, one to your

15

place is going to be the county clerk's office in the

Well, how far away

I don't know the County seats aren't

very far for people in Indiana.
MR. SMITH:

No.

If you're an indigent

25

you'd have to take the bus 17 miles down to Crown Point
16

2

indigent that's a significant burden, and -

And if you're

It's not a burden if you're

not indigent?

MR. SMITH:

Well, it's -- it's less of a

burden, Your Honor, considerably less of a burden.

10

MR. SMITH:

You

17 miles is 17 miles for

-- public transportation,

11

because the person presumably has no access to an

12

automobile because they don't have a driver's license

13

and they're indigent and they're living in Gary,

14

Indiana.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We have -- the

16

record shows that fewer than 1 percent of people in

17

Indiana don't have a photo ID.

18

MR. SMITH:

That is not what the record

19

shows, Your Honor, and it's not what the district court

20

said.

21

this Court decided the case on that assumption.

22

the district court said is if you compare the voting age

23

population in the census to the total number of driver's

24

licenses and IDs that have been issued, you get that

25

disparity of 43,000 or 1 percent, but what the district

I think it's -- it would be really a travesty if

17
Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official - Subject to Final Review

court went on to say is this is probably not accurate

because the total of licenses and IDs includes all the

2

consent decree they signed with the United States.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, don't you

4

think if you have the voter rolls with a significant

5

number of bad registrants, either dead or duplicates,

6

that that presents a significant potential for fraud?

7

MR. SMITH:

I suppose.

I don't know if I

8

can say significant.

The situation has existed for now

9

a number of years, and the salient fact here is that

10

there's not a single recorded example of voter

11

impersonation fraud.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's because

13

it's less of an issue.

14

500,000 votes, you may not be terribly worried if some

15

percentage were cast by fraud, but you might look to the

16

future and realize there could be a closer election and

17

there -- it's a type of fraud that, because it's fraud,

18

it's hard to detect.

19

MR. SMITH:

If somebody wins an election by

No, it's actually not, Your

20

Honor.

It's the type of fraud that the Elections

21

Commission said -- found is unlikely, the most unlikely,

22

because it's not that hard to detect.

with a neighborhood person who knows a lot of people who

You deter it by the

penalties.

And then you have JUSTICE ALITO:

If this is not a problem at

5

all, how do you account for the fact that the Commission

6

on Federal Election Reform that was co-chaired by former

7

President Carter and former Secretary of State Baker

8

recommended a voter ID requirement, and many other

9

countries around the world have voter ID requirements?

10

MR. SMITH:

What they recommended, Your

11

Honor, is exactly what Justice Ginsburg anticipated,

12

which is get everybody the cards, and then we'll be like

13

Europe, and everything will work really fine, and it'll

actually help the poor to have these IDs for a lot of

other purposes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As I understand, they

17

were going to have some years in between when their

18

proposal was enacted, and they were going to have a

19

mobile unit going around to all the neighborhoods, lots

20

of advertising, because a premise of that Carter-Baker

21

report was that everybody would easily and costlessly

22

get this photo ID.

23

MR. SMITH:

I would encourage the Court to

refer to the Democratic Party Exhibit 18, which is an

JUSTICE ALITO:

require that if it's not any problem at all?

Doesn't it

about the real ID law and that sort of thing.

Well, if you concede that

21

some kind of voter ID requirement is appropriate, the

22

problem that I have is where you draw the line on a

any way the extent of the problem or the extent of the

25

burden, how many people will actually be prevented from
26

1

voting or significantly burdened from voting as a result

2

of the requirement?

3

one side of the line or the other side of the line?

4

How do we tell whether this is on

MR. SMITH:

Well, it is a difficult area of

5

the law for you for that reason, Justice Alito.

6

you like at Timmons what it says is there's no litmus

7

test, there's no escaping the hard judgments.

8

the area where the courts have to be not too deferential

9

even though there are hard judgment calls about matters

10

of degree, because this is an area where the concern is

11

that the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch are

12

going to abuse their power to regulate the electoral

13

process to find subtle ways to skew the outcome on

14

election day.

15

But if

This is

As John Hard Ely says, this is an area where

judicial review is the most important, the most

17

legitimate.

though there are difficult matters of balancing involved

JUSTICE SOUTER:

that, you know, we've got to be careful and it's

down to the question of quantification, which is one of

4

the issues that he raised.

5

issue that there is no quantification of the actual

6

burden measured by the number of voters who are going to

7

be adversely affected?

What's the answer to that?

8

MR. SMITH:

The answer is that there's

plenty of evidence in the record about the number of
people in this country who don't have IDs.

14

What's your response to the

What have you got -- what is -- what is your

MR. SMITH:

The best argument for Indiana is

15

if you take the district court's 43,000 figure and you

16

adjust it for the two factors, death and departure, that

17

I mentioned before, the number becomes more like 400,000

18

people in the State of Indiana who lack IDs and are of

19

voting age, eligible -- voting age population people.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And how many of them are

21

going to suffer from an unreasonable denial of an

22

opportunity to get the ID which the State will provide

23

through the Bureau of Motor Vehicles?

quantify that?

basically have to take into account all of those

factors:

-- if you were writing the opinion and what you wanted

to put in the opinion was a reasonable estimate of the

burdened in having -- who do not now have the

What approximate number would you arrive at and how

would you -- how would you get to it?

MR. SMITH:

them are registered voters.

It

I don't think there's ever been any dispute

8

about the accuracy of the record.

Now, the judge did

9

acknowledge that there might be some outliers one

10

direction or another, but those cannot possibly account

11

for 10 times the number.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, I just want to -- I

13

just want to know what your figure.

15

And my recollection in the red brief is that you said,

16

all right, let's take the 43,000 figure.

17

you discounted it for, but it got it down to 25,000.

18

Some of those would be able to vote absentee, but

19

this -- I take it you're conceding that, at least

20

5

people.

That is something that inconveniences some

6

And we're talking about 35 times more -- in

7

terms of a percentage, we're talking about 66.8 percent

8

or so of the population that reports being registered to

9

vote, far short of the percentage based on the

10

calculations of the district court or anything in the

11

ballpark of that that don't have photo identification.

12

So we're talking about an infinitesimal portion of the

13

electorate that could even be, conceivably be burdened

14

by this.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, isn't that a little

16

bit of a stretch, too, when you say "infinitesimal"?

17

mean, if you take your two-thirds figure and so on,

18

isn't it fair to say that you're probably going to get

19

down to something like 10,000 people or 10,000 plus who

20

are going to be affected in the sense that they're going

21

to have to scurry around if, if they're going to get the

22

appropriate ID?

23

MR. FISHER:

And at that level, you're

24

talking about less than a half a percent of the total

4

merely de minimis and is something that should count in

6

MR. FISHER:

Well, if that's going to be the

7

case, then you're going to have a big problem with voter

8

registration, which is a far bigger problem for more

voters.

That is a procedure that the Court has long

require as much documentation and as much travel as -

as the -- as this voter ID procedure would have.

As I read

1

the Indiana voter registration application, all a person

2

has to do to register is to write in, enclose a utility

3

bill that has his name and address, and if he doesn't

4

have a photo ID, he can write the four numbers of his

5

Social Security; and if he doesn't have that either he

6

doesn't have to do anything, and they will give him a

7

number -- and you mail it in.

And you're registered.

8

So all a person who have to do if he wants

9

to be fraudulent is make out a fraud one of those, and

10

he has a photo ID; he can go to the polls.

situation unfortunately where with inflated voter lists,

with reports of fraud around the country, the General

How does Indiana stack up

against other States in the inflation of the voter

that -- that the parties to the consent decree at the

State level, while they can't identify individuals who

have -- have dormant registrations, and they can send

is that when we've got a situation where there is an

22

obvious gap in security at the polls, where the public

MR. FISHER:

Not explicitly.

That is true;

6

that's part of the argument, but the other part is that

7

there is a reasonable and obvious step to take to ensure

8

that there is no fraud at the polls.

Maybe there is a

10

reasonable, obvious step you can take to make your

that by the NVRA.

from preventing local officials -- I'm sorry, from

dead voters for them?

20

2

With respect -- in Indiana -- with respect to the

3

elderly who can swear that they were never issued a

4

birth certificate, there is an alternate means of

5

identification, but that's the only category.

6

The other thing we run into is the REAL ID

Act.

If Indiana wants to have an identification card

that can be acceptable in Federal facilities, it's going

to have to have minimal criteria for issuing those photo

it would not be permissible to get around a birth

I mean there are alternatives, such as a passport, but I

as-applied challenge that wasn't this kind of grab bag

25

challenge that looks at all the various different
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

classes of people that might be adversely affected, if

2

we had a challenge that focused on that particular

3

issue, I would imagine -- I don't know for sure -- I

4

would imagine that the State would probably put on some

5

evidence that says, look, there's a reason we did it

6

that way; we piggybacked on the general provisional

7

ballot provisions and what we decided is that, if we had

8

people executing indigency affidavits at the polling

9

place, it would add to the lines as the the polls.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They didn't make that

11

argument now.

12

an election to hear that, any more than we have to wait

13

until after an election to identify the voters that

14

Justice Ginsburg has.

15

I mean we don't have to wait until after

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But with respect, Justice

16

Souter, I mean that's not the way this challenge

17

proceeded.

18

under the sun, to the whole sort of -- this statute ab

19

initio, and it wasn't something that really put the

20

State on notice that that was the nub of the dispute and

21

would put evidence in the record that might join the

22

issue.

23

I mean there was a challenge to everything

And again I would say, of course, if there

24

were that kind of as-applied challenge, one of the

25

virtues of it would be that the remedy at the end of the
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

day would not be to strike the statute down on its face,

2

but it would be an injunction consistent with the

3

teaching of this Court in Nayot that said, look, you

4

need to have -- you need to be enjoined to offer the

5

affidavits at the polling place -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That would be a -- because That would be a virtue, but

9

one of the vices would be that it would be after the

10

election and the entire matter would be academic for

11

another 2 years, until another 2 years had passed.

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think so.

I

13

mean, at this point, like I said -- I mean we have these

14

32 potential plaintiffs.

Well, if the claim could

be brought in sufficient time, I suppose it would.

And if we assume that

everyone who has a decent claim under this Act went

25

through the hoops to get the provisional ballot at the

-- wherever the county office is and -

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

Sure.
-- that's an assumption

which need not necessarily be made.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But, conversely, nowhere

6

is it -- nowhere is it a rational assumption that all 32

7

of these individuals has a great claim.

8

some of them are people who just forgot their ID -

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, I'm not

concentrating -

11
12

It may be that

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- and for those people I

don't think they have much of a claim.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I was trying to deal with

14

this one category of person, and the State -- it was

15

addressed, and the State said, well, we can't do it that

16

way because that will lead to congestion at the polling

17

place.

18

to reconcile with the claim that there are so few of

19

these people it's not really a problem.

20

few of them, then I don't understand why they should be

21

put to the burden of going someplace other than the

22

polling place.

23

But it seems to me that that is powerfully hard

GENERAL CLEMENT:

If there are so

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

24

mean I think there's a rationale justification for that

25

which is that, you know, if -- especially if there are
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only a handful of these people, is do you really want to

2

instruct every poll worker at every precinct on how to

3

deal with this unusual situation or do you want to say,

4

you know, that's sort of an outlying situation, let's

5

instruct one poll worker at the county elections office

6

how to deal with it?

7

Now, at the end of the day, you may not be

8

persuaded that that's the way to do it.

I think that's

9

a reasonable argument, but an as-applied challenge could

10

focus like a laser beam on those particular voters and

11

those challenges.

12

voters in front of you.

13

You could have particular indigent

And it seems to me that that's the

14

preferable way to adjudicate this kind of claims, and I

15

think what this Court could do is this Court could

16

reject the facial challenge that is before it here that

17

leave open the possibility of that as-applied challenge,

18

or one could certainly imagine a veteran who has a

19

Federal photo ID without an expiration date who comes

20

into court and says, look, it's irrational to make me go

21

get a different form of ID.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That as-applied challenge

If we did that, I assume

challenges could be made in advance of the election.

I don't see any reason why

3

I mean it might depend a little bit

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And presumably the

challenges could be adjudicated.

5

down to the courthouse when you file a provisional

6

ballot, and if it turns out the election was decided by

7

three votes and there are 30 provisional ballots,

8

presumably the challenge can be brought at that point as

9

well.

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

You have 10 days to go

That is true, and there is

11

a provision for judicial review under Indiana law, of

12

the provisional ballots, if there's an ongoing dispute.

13

But I also take the point that some of this could be

14

taken care of well in advance of the election, which is

assume it would be easier to file a lawsuit and go off

21

with the burden of litigation rather than go back to get

23

affidavits, you know, to have a Federal case over it

24

seems a little bit improbable.

25

If you're challenging two

GENERAL CLEMENT:

You know, it may be,

where there have been these laws, there have been -- the
one observed phenomenon definitely is litigation.

brought.

appropriate case to apply that lesson, because I can

imagine there -

is standing in this case to bring the facial challenge?

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think it's a close

22

question, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

there is standing.

24

here is the standing to represent the nine or so

25

individuals that are addressed specifically on pages 49a

I would say that I think

I think the standing that exists

Alderson Reporting Company

and 51a of the district court opinion.

2

individuals who do not have photo IDs.

3

Those are

I think that as to the membership issue,

4

boy, if the Indiana Democratic Party has any members,

5

its probably these individuals, because they are poll

6

workers and active in the parties.

7

And what I would say about those

8

individuals, though, is that it is telling that the only

9

individuals they have been able to identify who don't

10

have photo IDs also happen to be elderly individuals who

11

can, by right, vote by absentee ballot.

12

Now, that's not to say -- and I would -- I

would concede there is a legally protected interest in

14

voting in person sufficient to cross the Article III

15

threshold.

16

17

have been able to identify do have a ready mechanism

available to them.

19

But I think, when you are looking for the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If you look at the real

20

world impact and you ask whether the Democratic Party

21

has standing to challenge the law, is it relevant that

22

the State legislature is split entirely on party lines?

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

May I answer the question?

24

You know, I don't think that's relevant in this -- I

25

would hate to think that a party line vote would
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

necessarily give the other party standing as a general

2

rule.

3

I don't think that you would adopt that, and

4

this goes out of the record, of course, to a recent

5

study.

6

shows that the Democratic Party did well in the 2006

7

elections, and turnout went up a little bit.

8
9

But the one study that's been done actually

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But don't you think it's

fair to infer that this law does have an adverse impact

10

on the Democrats that is different from its impact on

11

the Republicans?

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, again, if I could

13

answer, I mean I would just say that, you know, if this

14

was a cleverly designed mechanism by the Republican

15

Party to disadvantage the Democratic Party, at least in

16

2006 it looks like it went pretty far awry from their

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

22

MR. SMITH:

Thank you, Your Honor.

23

Let me start by addressing the question of

24

what reasonable alternatives there are to the strict law

25

that we are dealing with here.

This is the most strict

62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

law in the country.

2

the range of laws that are out there in other States is

3

a very different set of responses that occur when a

4

voter shows up without an ID in hand.

5

And what you have when you look at

In Michigan and several other States, for

6

example, the response is to say:

7

going to make you fill out an affidavit attesting to who

8

you are, and that you are a registered voter; that you

9

live in this precinct; and we'll let you go ahead and

10

All right, we are

vote a regular ballot.

11

That in those States they -- they consider

12

that a sufficient safeguard while looking at the IDs of

13

all the people who have the IDs.

14

In Florida they have a different approach,

15

which is to let you vote a provisional ballot, and then

16

what they do is they judge your signature match later on

17

in exactly the same process that's used for absentee

18

ballots.

19

We have a lot of information in this record

20

about why it's okay to have absentee ballots allowed

21

without an ID in Indiana, and they say, well, we have

22

these specialized committees that know how to do

23

signature matches; and they are trained; and so we get

24

thousands of these absentee ballots in.

25

carefully scrutinize them.

benefits and the burdens and come out with the

too hard -- far.

To paraphrase King Lear:
This Court has never

about facial weighing of systemic benefits and burdens

22

23

that are being imposed, a whole range of them depending

24

on the kind of people involved and their particular

25

circumstances, will have an effect on the outcome of the

Imagine, if you will, what it would be like

3

to try to have all these class actions being brought,

4

some by the people who don't have IDs, some by the

5

people who have IDs but don't have enough money.

6

would have to figure out exactly how much money people

7

are allowed to have in order to be in this exempt class.

8
9

You

The courts would then be creating exempt
classes, trying to decide whether the legislature would

10

have wanted an exemption drawn or not.

11

would be a complete and utter morass.

12

even if you did carve out an exception for indigent

13

people or for some other group of people, you ultimately

14

would leave untouched the real problem, which is the

15

concern that even for people who are relatively -

16

suffer relatively minor inconvenience, maybe one percent

17

of them are not going to show up and vote.

burdens on people from quite severe to less severe, and

about increments, why shouldn't we also ask whether our
