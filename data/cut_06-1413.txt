ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. BRINKMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

The ruling of the Illinois Appellate Court

12

in this case radically expanded the Court's

13

operational-function tax.

14

violates the principles of constitutional limitations on

15

state taxing authority for at least two reasons.

16

First, the factors relied on by the appellate court here

17

for functional -- for operational function would mean

18

that ownership and investment would meet that standard.

19

But that's what this Court rejected in Allied-Signal.

20

The State tax at issue

A State does not have the authority to reach

21

out to tax all investments owned by a company that does

22

business in the State.

23

more.

24
25

The operational function demands

You are saying to me, Ms.

Brinkmann -- we talk about an asset, an investment.

This is a division

And we are talking about a sale of

Not the sale of stock of a subsidiary.

5

So what more is there than this is one

6

company, it sells some of its assets?

7

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, the fact

8

that it's a division does not mean that it meets either

9

the operational-function test or the unitary-business

10

test.

A long line of cases from this Court tell us

11

that.

It -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we have any cases -

13

do we have any decisions that go against the state

14

taxing authority that involve divisions as opposed to

15

subsidiaries?

16

MS. BRINKMANN:

No, but the Exxon case

17

involved divisions, and it went in favor of the state

18

taxing authority.

19

straightforward, unitary business analysis to that.

20

And, Your Honor, this dates back to the Adams Express

21

case of 1897.

22

But the Court applied a

The Court in that case said it's not

23

ownership.

It's about the use, the unitariness of use,

not of ownership.

Honor.

But it does come back to the taxing, the right

2

of the domicile State to tax on a sale -

What is -- what does the

5

6

of constitutional law, the only State that has authority

7

to tax the capital gain is Ohio?

That's right, Your Honor,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does Ohio -- would Ohio

11

give credit for the tax that its sister State thinks is

12

due?

13

Does Ohio give credit to taxes paid by other States -

14

to other States?

What is, in fact, Ohio's tax law in this respect?

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

Ohio would allocate the

16

entire gain as a capital gain on an intangible that was

17

sold in the State of Ohio.

18

its entirety to Illinois.

19

That would be allocated in

Now, what the Court has recognized is that

20

default principle sometimes gives way when that gain has

21

had enough connection to business activity in another

22

jurisdiction.

23

I mean, you just said, as I understand it, Illinois has

the right to tax Lexis under business activities in

And if I could turn -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you saying this is a

passive investment?

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How can you call it a

6

passive investment, not only when there was -- I think

7

undisputedly -- as -- as much interest and activity in

8

Nexis's business planning by the Mead people?

9

mind even more importantly, when in fact Mead, I think a

10

couple of times, merged with -- with Nexis -- with Lexis

11

-- when that provided a tax advantage, by -- by giving

12

them loss carryforwards that reduced their taxes.

13

isn't it fair to -- to say under the operational

14

function test that if -- if the company is -- if Nexis

15

is -- is mergeable with Mead when it produces a tax

16

advantage and is certainly in a very operational sense

17

functional then, because it's saving them a lot of

18

money -- and that's, that has nothing to do with passive

19

investment.

it ought when the -- when the tide turns be -- be

21

regarded as close enough in operational function to be

22

taxable when the gain comes in.

Why

MR. BAROV:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Illinois is not attempting to tax income

it seeks to tax here is income earned by Mead on its

13

electronic publishing business, Lexis, which conducted

14

To the contrary, the income

Mead paid taxes on the income that the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

off the table.

Illinois is quite irrelevant.

It seems to me that, under

your theory, you could tax the sale, even if Lexis were

2

not in Illinois at all, just because Mead is.

3

MR. BAROV:

If this - if they were unitary,

4

yes, then Lexis's presence in Illinois would be

5

irrelevant to this case, if they met the

6

unitary-business doctrine.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's not the question.

2

I'm not using it in my day-to-day work.

3

Now, are those four things alone sufficient

4

for Illinois to tax the sale of my iron mine?

5

seems to me, is the way they presented it.

a unitary business really, but I guess we have to send

7

it back for that.

to that same question:

If you're going to have the

20

unitary-tax theory, that's -- that's very helpful.

21

if we take the unitary-tax theory off the table, it

seems to me that you are confusing the law by having

23

some midway test.

25

question.

I don't know what your theory is,

Alderson Reporting Company

But

3

MR. BAROV:

There's a two-part answer to

that question -- those questions, Your Honor.
First, there's a second avenue of State

4

taxation that's been well recognized by this Court for

5

at least 80 years, which is that if a business conducts

6

business in a State, a State has a tax -- has the right

7

to tax a share of that business.

8

Illinois did here.

9

this case, it apportioned the income only based on

And that's all

When it apportioned the income in

10

Lexis's in-State Illinois presence.

11

avenue alone, the tax is constitutional.

12

The second -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So under that

But Mead didn't receive -

14

pardon me -- Lexis didn't receive the money for the

15

sale, Mead did.

16

MR. BAROV:

Right.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Unless, again, if Mead's

18

presence or nonpresence is simply irrelevant to what

19

happened here, absent a unitary theory.

20

MR. BAROV:

No, Your Honor.

Mead received

21

the tax -- the gain for the sale because Lexis was a

22

division of Mead, and the only tax-paying -- the only -

23

there is no -- there was no legal entity known as

24

"Lexis" at the time that Lexis was sold.

25

-- it was assets owned by the Mead Corporation.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

It was assets

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, Mead received the benefit -- the gain

2

on the sale because Mead was the only tax-paying entity

3

in this case.

4

Illinois called "Lexis," and, therefore, Illinois could

5

tax at least -

6

So Mead was conducting a business in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you think that if there

had been a separate corporation and that Lexis was a

subsidiary corporation and the subsidiary was -- it was

sold, that, again, absent a finding of unitary, Illinois

10
11
12

MR. BAROV:

Yes.

Illinois could have taxed

Honor, is that Lexis had a presence in Illinois.

That gets back to Justice

Stevens's initial hypothetical.

and you have an investment in a company that does a lot

22

of business in Illinois and you in New York, a resident

23

individual, sell that stock, under your theory Illinois

24

could tax it.

25

MR. BAROV:

No.

If you live in New York

Illinois can't tax that

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State because there is no relationship -- there has to

2

be some relationship, you know, between Illinois and the

3

tax-paying activity and the taxpayer.

4

In Justice Breyer's hypothetical there was

5

none.

But there is a -- but let me, if I can, address

6

that prong of the analysis, also.

7

Here there was a much closer connection

8

between Lexis and Mead than simply that of a passive

9

investment.

It wasn't just that Mead helped Lexis buy,

10

make, handle acquisitions.

11

actual acquisitions themselves, in purchasing and

12

contracting to make those acquisitions.

13

They were involved in the

Mead was involved in many of the -- in

14

controlling lots of their capital investment, its -- and

15

its -- it was also involved in manipulating excess -- in

16

their excess cash.

17

host of facts that supported a closer relationship

18

between Mead and Lexis than simply that, that passive

19

investment.

20

And there is a whole -- there was a

So whether -- even if you are looking at it

21

from the operational-function point of view, there was

22

-- there was a -- a sufficient connection between Lexis

23

and Mead beyond that of Justice Breyer's hypothetical.

capital gain like this to their own domicile State.

6
7

9

Some States will allocate an intangible

Other States will apportion it based on the
share of income that is done in the State.
Again, I don't know what Ohio did.

But the

point is that's a rule -- that's a State-law rule of

10

choice, not a rule of -- a constitutional rule.

I think

11

this Court has been pretty clear in the Mobil Oil case

12

that these -- those -- that doesn't have a

13

constitutional significance.

14

That when a State, a domicile State, and a

15

State where a source -- which is the source of income,

that apportionment is the default rule.

one of passive investment.

On -- on your theory, would -- would the

10

State of Illinois be able to tax a portion of the

11

capital gain?

12

MR. BAROV:

Yes, they would, Your Honor.

13

But they would be limited in how much of that capital

14

gain they could apportion.

15

limited to the amount of income that arose in Illinois.

16

And that's what the auditor did in this case.

17

They would apportion it

is wholly accidental with reference to what went on in

the sale.

MR. BAROV:

No, Your Honor, it wasn't.

I

mean Lexis did considerable business in Illinois, and

the auditor was isolating Illinois's business in

it's even more dramatic to me that you didn't raise the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let me ask you about the

8

theory that both the trial court and the intermediate

10

which has been brought up in a few of our cases, but I

don't know any that was decided.

hold for the State taxing authority?

Did we ever have any

No, Your Honor.

But in

certain -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

But one of the

problems with applying it as you urge here is that that

19

would just override -- why would anyone go to the

20

trouble of making a case under the so-called unitary

21

business test, because the operational function test

22

would be much easier to meet?

23

MR. BAROV:

So -

I guess on that point I would

24

disagree with you a bit, Your Honor.

very -- they're different types that look at different

I think there are

3

where a business is unitary but not operational or -

4

I'm sorry, an asset is operational, but isn't

5

necessarily -

6

So one doesn't -- while the same facts

JUSTICE BREYER:

What?

What?

What could it

7

be?

That is -- as I read this, I thought, well, there

8

is no separate test.

9

situation that comes up fairly commonly where someone

It's just there's a certain

10

claims that an asset of a company was really quite

11

separate, and therefore when they get income from it or

12

they sell it it has nothing to do with my business.

13

the answer is:

14

business, you used the working capital and so forth, in

15

which case it's part of the business.

it -- how is it different from that?

And

It did have something to do with your

JUSTICE BREYER:

So how -- how is

I agree, Your Honor.
Well, if you agree with

19

that, do you really agree, because if you agree with

20

that there's no such separate test, this court was wrong

21

to consider it separately, the lower court, and they

22

should have reached the question they didn't reach,

23

which was is this whole thing one single business, which

24

is normally called the unitary business test?

25

MR. BAROV:

Your Honor, on that point I
43

Alderson Reporting Company

disagree.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. BAROV:

Good.

All right.

I think there is -- I mean,

4

they're both ways of reaching the overall unitary

5

principle, whether you can show the intangible flow of

6

assets -- of value between a company -- I can give you

7

an example, say, of a company that would be unitary but

8

where the operational function analysis wouldn't apply

9

is the Container Corp. Type fact pattern, where you have

10

a domestic -- a domestic parent providing value out to

11

the foreign subsidiaries, but there is nothing sort of

12

flowing back to the domestic parent.

13

using those subsidiaries in the domestic business.

14

nevertheless, there is enough value being thrown out

15

that it passed the unitary threshold.

16

They're not really
But

The unitary -- the unitary -- I'm sorry.

17

The operational function analysis or test or principle,

18

whatever you want to call it, arises in the examples

19

given in Allied-Signal.

20

something which isn't really part of the rest of your

21

business, but you're using it in that business to

22

support it way beyond just a passive investment.

23

As you said, you've got

And this -- in this case, that's how Mead

24

was using Lexis.

They were using it to support their,

25

the value of their multiple, their multi-state business,
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

by manipulating -- by making capital contributions,

2

manipulating corporate structures, and bringing back

3

that tax and net loss carryforwards, which increased the

4

value, which increased their business activities.

5

So this case actually is that -- is that -

6

falls within that paradigm also.

7

like either of those hypotheticals in Allied-Signal, not

8

unlike the use of working -- investment of working

9

capital.

10

It's not unlike any -

So, yes, both -- the test, while there are

11

facts that overlap them, they can show that there are

12

different relationships.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So say you -- but you

14

would be asking us, if you were going to go on that

15

operational function, to take two examples that were

16

given in Allied-Signal that are quite different from

17

what's involved here, and to make that a doctrine when

18

you recognize that we have never used that theory to

19

hold for a State taxing authority in the context of a

20

multi-state enterprise?

21

MR. BAROV:

Your Honor, I don't think you

22

have to create a separate doctrine again.

23

are both considered different ways of showing the

intangible flow of value, the significant links between

as corollaries of each other.

that an asset serves in a business.

said, as I've said, there are two possible ways that -

21

two different constitutional paths or theories that we

22

can go down in this case to meet the -- that allows

23

Illinois to apportion.

24
25

Independent of the operational links, Mead
can tax the gain on Lexis simply because Lexis conducted

Alderson Reporting Company

business in Illinois.

2

investment income based on its investment in a separate

3

business, and that's exactly what Illinois -- that's

4

another way to uphold the Illinois appellate court's

5

decision.

6

A state may tax a nonresident's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If Illinois -- if Ohio

7

is, in fact, taxing the whole gain at its full rate on

8

the theory that this entire income should be allocated

9

to Ohio, then you do have an element of double taxation,

10

right?

11

MR. BAROV:

That's possible, Your Honor, but

12

it's -- first, there is no -- there's no evidence that

13

Ohio in fact did that.

14

should have disposed of that, that contention, because

15

this Court rejected a similar argument that the mere

16

possibility of taxation by a domiciliary State

17

foreclosed taxation by a State where the business was

18

present.

19

But I think the Mobil Oil case

And under Mobil Oil, when a resident State's

20

claim and a source State's claim conflict, this Court

21

indicated that the resident State's claim must yield to

22

that of the source State.

of multiple taxation in this case.

So there should be no issue

6

presence in Illinois becomes relevant because in that

case, whether you look at this as a separate business

tax a nonresident on an investment in that State as well

23

as the tax is properly prorated to the amount of income

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

At the time of this sale

In fact -

Do you have any case like

whether some other corporation that has disappeared now

you have to establish connection with the taxpayer.

Ultimately you have to come down to connecting it to

9

this functional doctrine that you're relying on.

10

MR. BAROV:

No, Your Honor.

Under

11

International Harvester, I think that the Court made it

12

very clear that even a passive investment can be taxed

13

by a State.

14

LEXIS was a passive investor and Mead was only investing

15

in Illinois, Illinois could still tax Mead on the value

16

of its investment that arose in Illinois.

And so Mead

17

realized the gain.

Mead can be

taxed as long as the tax is properly prorated to the

19

Illinois presence, which it was in this case.

20

If Mead -- Mead can be taxed -- even if

Mead is the taxpayer.
