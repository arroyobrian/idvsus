ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FISHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The rule of lenity requires that any penal

12

statute the government seeks to enforce against an

13

individual must clearly and unambiguous apply to him

14

and, as the government acknowledges its brief in this

15

case, this Court has applied the rule of lenity in

16

numerous recent cases involving mandatory sentencing

17

provisions.

18

principle is all that is necessary to decide this case.

A reaffirmation of that time-honored

19

The 20-year mandatory -

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Granderson?

22
23

Is that the first time we did it?
MR. FISHER:

Well, the rule of lenity has

been -

24
25

Is it time-honored since

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As to sentences?

sentences?
3

Alderson Reporting Company

As to

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. FISHER:

As to sentencing?

No, in the

2

mid-20th century, Justice Kennedy, in the Bell decision

3

written by Justice Frankfurter and in Ladner, both

4

involved the degree of punishment which the defendant

5

would receive.

6

Simpson case, and Bifulco around the same time.

7

Court has a history of applying the rule of lenity with

8

equal force to sentencing provisions as it does to

9

statutes demarcating criminal conduct or not.

There are other cases:

In 1980 the
So this

And of

10

course, as the green brief specially highlights, the

11

very essence and the core of the rule of lenity derives

12

from the English common law, which is -- which was

13

designed to invoke the rule of lenity to avoid mandatory

14

punishment, not -- not so much whether conduct was

15

criminal or not.

16

So we think that applying that rule in a

17

straightforward manner to this case requires a reversal.

18

The 20-year mandatory minimum in Section 841(b)(1)(A)

19

applies only to defendants who have a prior conviction

20

for a, quote, "felony drug offense."

21

reading of that provision is that a State law

22

misdemeanor simply does not constitute a felony drug

23

offense.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, a sensible

Well, but if the

rule of lenity depends upon of course some ambiguity in

4

classification.

5

It doesn't say anything about State

MR. FISHER:

That's right, Mr. Chief

6

Justice, and if that's all you had on the statute books

7

this might be an easier case.

8

above section 44 and section 13 the term "felony" is

9

described and defined as "a crime that is classified as

But as you know, I think,

10

a felony under Federal or State law."

11

start with section 841(b)(1)(A), which uses the term

12

"felony drug offense," and you go to the definitional

13

section, the first thing you come to is the definition

14

of felony, which says a crime classified as such.

15

then, as you say, in section 44 you reach another

16

definition.

17

an ambiguity here in which Congress has given two

18

facially applicable definitions to the operative

19

provision of the statute.

20

And so when you

And

So we think that at the very least you have

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, obviously one

21

is a definition of "felony" and the other is the

22

definition of "felony drug offense" and the term that's

23

at issue here is "felony drug offense."

24
25

MR. FISHER:

Well, in a sense it's our

position that both are at issue here.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

The term

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"felony," which is within the term "felony drug

2

offense," is also at issue here.

3

out in pages 11 and 12, 11 and 12 of our yellow brief,

4

it's not uncommon for Congress to have two separate

5

definitions one of which is a single term within a

6

broader term in a statute.

7

government would argue, that the word "felony" is not

8

repeated in the definition of subsection 44 does not

9

mean that Congress meant that to be the sole definition.

10

And as we've pointed

And so the mere fact, as the

We've given three examples on pages 11 and

11

12 where the sensible reading of the statute is that

12

Congress attempted to nest the definition of a single

13

term within the definition of a broader term.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I -- could I ask you

15

what you think Congress might have been trying to do

16

with the 1994 amendment under -- under your reading?

17

19

offense," and as I understand it your reading is that

20

now the offense must be classified as a felony and it

must be punishable by more, by imprisonment for more

than a year.

24

more than a year, if there were not offenses that were

2

point was to rule those out.

3

I can't see the point unless the

And you haven't cited any State statute in

4

your brief that involved an offense that was classified

5

as a felony and is punishable by less than a year.

6

cited a couple that were punishable by exactly a year,

7

not more than a year but exactly a year.

8

your theory that the reason for adding this new language

9

was to make it clear that those offenses where the

So is it your,

10

maximum was 12 months, as opposed to 12 months and a

11

day, would not be counted?

12

MR. FISHER:

You

I think there is an agreement

13

between us and the government on this point.

14

our blue brief statutes from Arizona as well as a couple

15

of other States where there are crimes that are

16

classified as felonies but punishable in less than a

17

year.

18

that that is the effect of the 1994 conforming

19

amendments, is to exclude those outlier States that take

20

low-level crimes and nonetheless classify them as

21

felonies.

22

We cite in

And in those cases we agree with the government

What this case is about JUSTICE ALITO:

But if I could just come

23

back to that.

I looked at those.

You cite Ohio, North

24

Carolina, and Arizona and those are all punishable by -

25

they all have a maximum term of 12 months, not less
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

than.

So the difference is between 12 months and 12

2

months and a day?

3
4

MR. FISHER:

Well, that works on the

language of the statute, Justice Alito.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

But is it plausible that's

6

the reason why Congress added this language?

7

didn't want -- they wanted to make sure that these

8

felonies that were punishable by just 12 months would

9

not be counted?

10

MR. FISHER:

They

Well, I think it is quite

11

plausible that the language that Congress added has very

12

little practical effect.

13

that Congress called these nothing more than conforming

14

amendments, so Congress apparently wasn't trying to

15

accomplish any dramatic change here and I think it might

16

help to understand by looking at the other outlier

17

states that the government claims got swept in with the

18

1994 amendments.

19

Colorado.

20

possession of a single ounce of marijuana.

21

of the crimes in Arizona that we were just talking

22

about, that is a felony punishable by no more than a

23

year.

24

a different sense, in which they call these crimes

25

misdemeanors, like the vast majority of States, but make

And that flows from the fact

We cite statutes from States like

Perhaps if I used a concrete example.

Take

That is one

There are a few other States who are outliers in

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

them punishable by 18 months or more.

2

And so what the government's position is is

3

that in 1994 when Congress passed a conforming amendment

4

to exclude a couple of outlier States like Arizona, it

5

was trying to sweep in for the first time into section

6

841(b)(1)(A) outlier States like Colorado that treat

7

low-level drug crimes, low-level drug possession crimes,

8

as misdemeanors that are punishable by more than a year.

9

So we think, for the very reasons the

10

government explains, that Congress is trying to avoid

11

disuniformity and happenstance according to how a few

12

local jurisdictions might treat certain drug crimes,

13

that it makes sense to read the '94 conforming

14

amendments as requiring both the one-year punishment

15

rule and the felony classification requirement.

16

And if you have any doubt on that, we submit

17

it really makes sense to remember that what we're what

18

talking about here is a mandatory minimum.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so -

What would you do with

20

someone who was convicted -- had a prior conviction of

21

-- for importing 10 tons of heroin in New Jersey, for

22

example, where there are no felonies?

23

with that, a very serious drug offense in a State that

24

doesn't use the term "felony" at all or a foreign

25

conviction?
9

Alderson Reporting Company

What would you do

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FISHER:

Well, we've cited a case in our

2

brief in the Second Circuit that deals with that exact

3

problem, at least with the New Jersey problem.

4

the courts did and what they have done in other

5

circumstances where there's a felony classification

6

requirement is they simply take the crime in New Jersey

7

and analogize it to a comparable Federal or local State

8

crime, and if it was -- if it would be classified as a

9

felony in that local jurisdiction, then courts -- and

And what

10

this is even before the 1994 amendments -- courts have

11

treated it as a felony.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what they did -- what

13

they did in the Second Circuit case was to say this is

14

punishable -- this offense is punishable by more than a

15

year in New Jersey and therefore it's a felony.

16

MR. FISHER:

I believe, Justice Alito, this

17

was a case before 1994, so that's -

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

analogized it to a felony.

20

MR. FISHER:

I know.

And that's how they

Right, because that is the

21

Federal definition of a felony, and so that was the

22

analogy that the Second Circuit was able to draw here

23

and reach what we think is a commonsense way to deal

24

with the unusual problem of New Jersey.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Another -

You say there are other

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

examples where a -- a noun that is nested in another

2

definition is separately defined and the two are read

3

together.

4

understand what you say if this provision here read "The

5

term 'felony drug offense' means a felony that is

6

punishable by imprisonment for more than one year."

7

Then I'd go back to the "felony" definition for what a

8

felony means, but it doesn't repeat the "felony."

9

term 'felony drug offense' means an offense that is

How are those phrased?

I mean, I could

"The

10

punishable by imprisonment for" -- do any of the

11

examples of nesting that you -- that you bring forward

12

read this way?

13
14

MR. FISHER:
Scalia.

15
16
17

All three of them do, Justice

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which ones are they?

Where

are they MR. FISHER:

They're pages 11 and 12 of the

18

yellow brief.

And so the first place to start is

19

looking at the bottom of page 11, where the term

20

"employee" is defined in one provision of the Federal -

21

of the Federal statutory code.

22

"employee of the Capitol Police," "employee of the House

23

of Representatives" are also defined, and they're

24

defined -- and those broader definitions are in the

25

footnote at the bottom of page 12.

And then the terms

11
Alderson Reporting Company

And so you see that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there, after having defined the term "employee," the

2

word "employee" is not repeated in those definitions.

3

They talk about "a member" or "an officer" or "an

4

individual."

5

here, where a more generic term is used in the broader

6

definition, but it makes sense to read in the original

7

definition.

8
9

And so it's much like the circumstance

The same thing I think you can see in the
middle of page 12 with the part of the Bankruptcy Code

10

that we've given this Court.

11

defined in a certain way, and then later on in the

12

definitional provision, the term "debtor's principal

13

residence" is defined as "a residential structure" and

14

such and such.

15

in the broader definition, but we think the only way to

16

make sense of it is to import the definition of the

17

single term into the broader term.

18

wanted -

19

The word "debtor" is

Again the word "debtor" is not repeated

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If Congress had

Just on that -- just

20

on that last one, are you saying that if it doesn't say

21

"debtor's residential structure," you'd think it was

22

somebody else's residential structure?

23

MR. FISHER:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Well -

the point.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't understand

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FISHER:

Well, there might be, you know,

2

a very rigid plain-text argument that might be made.

3

The point is that Congress used -- defined the term

4

"debtor's principal residence" without using the term

5

"debtor" again and defined it somewhere else.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My -

Well, in a provision

7

of the Bankruptcy Code that deals with debtors I don't

8

think there's any question about whose residential

9

structure they would be talking about, even though they

10

don't repeat "debtor."

11

than the provision we have before us today.

12

MR. FISHER:

It strikes me as quite different

Well, then I think I'd refer

13

you back to the employee example.

I mean, no example is

14

going to be exactly on all fours.

I'm happy to

15

acknowledge that.

16

across is it's not unusual for Congress to define single

17

terms that are nested within larger terms.

The idea that I'm trying to get

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- better example.

It

20

doesn't quite work because it does not supersede the

21

term "debtor" that was used earlier.

22

government's submission at least in this case, "felony

23

drug offense" supersedes the earlier provision in

24

section 13.

25

MR. FISHER:

In the

I think that's right.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

think one way to -

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it seems to me they're

not comparable in that sense.

4

MR. FISHER:

Okay.

I think one way to

5

understand how this statute -- if Congress had wanted to

6

do what the government says it wanted to do, how

7

Congress could have made it absolutely clear -- while we

8

have the yellow brief open, we can look at page 13.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you a question

10

before going on with this line?

11

802(13) definition has to be satisfied and the 44

12

15

16

You say that both the

But was 802(13) ever applicable to

What was the law prior to the 1994

There was a section, wasn't there, that

MR. FISHER:

For a time, yes, Justice

17

Ginsburg, but -- so when the statute was originally

18

passed, 802(13) was the sole definition of "felony," and

19

then somewhere along the line between the original

20

enactment and the '94 amendments, a definition of

21

"felony drug offense" was put into 841(b)(1)(A) -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. FISHER:

Right.

-- but that itself just used

24

the word "felony," which again referred the reader back

25

to 802(13).

So, again, I think there is an agreement
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

between -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would you take a look at

3

that provision that was in 841(b)(1)?

4

that it would be duplicative of 802(13).

5
6

MR. FISHER:

Are you looking, Justice

Ginsburg, at the 1988 version of the statute?

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. FISHER:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

Because it seems

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

No, because Where would we find this?

Oh, this is at 13a of the blue

brief, Justice Scalia.

12

So, at page 13a it says, "For purposes of

13

this subparagraph, the term 'felony drug offense' means

14

an offense that is a felony under any provision of this

15

subchapter, under any Federal law."

16

"felony" again would have referred the reader back to

17

802(13).

18

Now, the word

MR. FISHER:

Right.

But I think, again, the

22

word "felony" as it appears in -- in that provision -

23

and I think that the government agrees with us on this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8
9

MR. FISHER:

12

Well, I think the latter

language, Justice Ginsburg, is defining -

10
11

"A felony under any law of a State or

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why would you need to

look MR. FISHER: -- "drug offense," whereas the

13

word "felony" I think is not a self-defining term in

14

that statute as it's written.

15

we're talking about something like a one-year rule or a

16

classification requirement, the reader needs to go back

17

to the definitional section.

18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And to understand whether

I don't -- the definitional

section contradicts -- contradicts what's in (b)(1)(A).

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. FISHER:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

As of 1988?
Yes.

It contradicts it

23

because the "felony" definition is classified as felony

24

by Federal or State law.

25

MR. FISHER:

Well, it says "a felony under
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the law of a State."

2

requirement -- I don't think it's inconsistent with it.

3

It might clarify it.

4

So I think the classification

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which is "under any

5

provision of this subchapter or any other Federal law

6

that prohibits or restricts."

7

part, "under any law of a" -- of "State" -- it picks up

8

"State" -- "or a foreign country."

9

not included in 802(13).

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12
13

And then in the last

"Foreign country" is

That's right, Justice Scalia.
So you have to say that

there "felony" stands on its own, right?
MR. FISHER:

Well, I guess you could, but

14

then you wouldn't have a definition; then you'd have to

15

figure out how to define "felony," whether it was a

16

classification or a one-year rule or something else.

17

think the natural reading, again, would be a

18

classification requirement to the extent to which you

19

couldn't look further than that provision of the

20

statute, but -

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I

Is the following true, that

22

if you are right the reason Congress passed this new

23

definition was it wanted to take those handful of States

24

which have felonies as a year, the ones Justice Alito is

25

talking about, and make clear that they are not covered?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But if the

3

government's right, then the reason Congress did this is

4

that it recognized what I think is the truth, that

5

felonies and misdemeanors are defined differently in

6

many different ways under the laws of many different

7

States and, in a matter where so much prison time turns

8

on it, wished to create a single, uniform definition.

9

Now, if that's right, I'm asking myself

10

which is a more plausible purpose.

11

MR. FISHER:

Well, we don't disagree with

12

the government that the one-year rule does serve the

13

purpose of helping iron out -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it doesn't, because if

15

you're right, then you first have to look to the

16

patchwork quilt of laws in all the different States to

17

see whether those different States define the conduct as

18

misdemeanors or felonies.

19

patchwork problem, we add on the requirement of one

20

year.

21

what Justice Alito said and nothing else.

22

And then, having solved the

And so the bite of the new definition would be

Now, that's -- and, yet, on the government's

23

interpretation, the bite is to create a single, readily

applied, uniform rule.

MR. FISHER:

That's what I'm trying to

respond -- different States treat drug crimes

10

dramatically different, and this is so -- I think it's

11

common sense that States treat different crimes -- treat

12

-- different States punish the same crime differently.

13

And that's nowhere more true than in drug crime, because

14

there's a great amount of experimentation that goes on

15

in the States.

16

States do, like Colorado, is take very low-level drug

17

crimes and punish them by more than a year, in part so

18

they can give treatment and keep people in, prison, long

19

enough to have treatment take hold, whereas some other

20

States treat drug crimes very differently.

21

a patchwork whether you look to the classification or

22

whether you look to the one-year rule.

23

think it makes sense to use both.

24
25

And one of the things that certain

So you have

whether you have a felony before you, it could have very

3

easily said so.

4

at page 13 of the yellow brief -- of what -- of what the

5

Federal Sentencing Guidelines do.

6

And there's an example -- and this is

is quite explicit.

punishable by more than a year, regardless of whether

They say a "felony" is "an offense

10

such an offense is specifically designated as a

12

So there are other provisions where Congress

13

could have looked and it would have been well aware of

14

how to make absolutely plain what it was trying to

15

accomplish in the statute.

16

Now, we don't think that the government's

17

reading is implausible, Justice Breyer, for the reason

can find another place where Congress dealt with this

2

problem explicitly.

3

It said that felonies are crimes punishable

4

more than a year; however, if the State classifies the

5

crime as a misdemeanor, it has to be punishable by more

6

than two years.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. FISHER:

6

reason why Congress put it in, and that's because it is

a continually vexing problem, how to define what is a

That's why Congress did it explicitly in the
That's why the Sentencing

And leaving that out, and

11

against the backdrop of a statute where the

12

classification rule was the controlling rule for over a

13

decade, and where they leave that classification rule in

14

the very same definitional provision of the statute, we

15

think, gives rise to an ambiguity.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If it's such a

17

vexing problem, why would Congress have incorporated the

18

problem into the definition of "felony drug offense"?

19
20
21

MR. FISHER:

Well, I'm not sure I follow the

question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you seem to

22

suggest that it's a vexing problem that "felony" is

23

defined differently in different States.

24

say that the term "felony," which relies on how it's

25

defined by different States, was incorporated in the

And, yet, you

2

definition of punishable by more than one year.

3

If they don't want to repeat the problem

4

that "felony" is defined differently in different

5

States, they would not do what you're suggesting, which

6

is incorporate it wholesale into the latter definition.

7

MR. FISHER:

Well, with all due respect,

8

what Congress did is they left 802(13) on the books,

9

which does turn on classifications.

And it's not -

10

even though it is a -- it is something of a patchwork,

11

it is not unusual at all to have very serious

12

consequences turn on whether something is classified as

13

a "felony" or not.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, of course, they had

15

to leave it on the books because they need a definition

16

of "felony."

17

but this is a definition of "felony drug offense."

18

--

19

"Felony" has to be defined in many places,

MR. FISHER:

So

Well, again, Justice Ginsburg,

20

I think that is right.

But then what Congress could

21

have done is use the language that the Federal

22

Sentencing Guidelines use, or something comparable to

23

make clear its intent.

24

And the classification of a felony or not a

25

felony, as this Court knows, has a time-honored import.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Things like the right to vote, the right to bear arms,

2

the right to various civil rights turn on whether

3

somebody has been convicted of a felony or a

4

misdemeanor.

5

And, again, this brings us in a sense back

6

to the rule of lenity because one of the principal

7

reasons for the rule of lenity is fair notice.

8

this Court, as early as the McBoyle decision recognized

9

that we're dealing with something of a fiction when we

Now,

10

imagine an offender is looking at the statutory books to

11

decide whether certain conduct is prohibited or not.

talking about very real and serious notice problems.

someone like Mr. Burgess as to whether he should plead

guilty to a misdemeanor or a felony.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE SAHARSKY

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21
22
23

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress answered the question presented in

24

this case when it adopted an express definition for

25

"felony drug offense."

Under that definition, "felony
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

drug offense" means an offense punishable by more than

2

one year of imprisonment under certain State, Federal,

3

or foreign drug laws.

4

There is no textual basis for going beyond

5

that definition to also require that an offense be

6

classified as a "felony."

7

the sentencing-enhancement provision is a felony drug

8

offense, and the way that the definition works is that

9

you take the definition Congress provided for "felony

10
11

The enhancement trigger in

drug offense."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is "drug" a nested

12

term in that?

13

look somewhere else for that definition?

14

It doesn't really define "drug."

MS. SAHARSKY:

Do they

Well, the term "felony drug

15

offense," the "drug" component we understand to be the

16

component that says "an offense" that prohibits -

17

"under law that prohibits or restricts conduct related

18

to narcotic drugs, marijuana, anabolic steroids" -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there a place you

20

would -- is that a place you would look if you didn't

21

know what they meant by "drug"?

22

whether, you know, a natural narcotic, I mean is that a

23

drug or not?

24
25

MS. SAHARSKY:

If an issue arose

There is a definition of

"drug" at the beginning of the Controlled Substances Act
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in section 802.

2

definition of "drug," I believe in section 321 of the

3

Controlled -

4
5
6

It refers back to the general

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that is nested in

this definition, "felony drug offense"?
MS. SAHARSKY:

The term "felony drug

7

offense" has only the meaning that Congress gave to it.

8

In the words it shows that it be punishable by more than

9

one year under State, Federal or foreign law relating to

10
11

those particular drugs.
In fact, the question that you asked shows

12

why Petitioner's reading of the statute cannot be

13

correct, that you can't use both the definition of

14

"felony drug offense" that Congress provided and try to

15

import in separate definitions for "felony" and separate

16

definitions for "drug," because the definition of "drug"

17

in the Controlled Substances Act is very broad and

18

applies to many different kinds of drugs, whereas the

19

definition of "felony drug offense" only refers to

20

offenses that involve narcotic drugs, anabolic steroids,

21

marijuana or depressant or stimulant substances.

22

In the same way, this shows why Petitioner

23

cannot be correct that the definition of "felony" also

24

must be brought into "felony drug offense," because

25

Congress chose that the measure of seriousness in

And that

10

language was taken out and Congress replaced it with

11

this new language, which says "punishable by more than

12

one year of imprisonment."

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do with

14

your friend's argument that the classification -- or the

15

term, more than one year or less than one year, doesn't

16

always have to do with how serious they view the

17

offense, but they may impose a sentence of more than one

18

year to allow time for rehabilitation?

19

MS. SAHARSKY:

Congress chose the words that

20

it did, "punishable by more than one year," because it

21

believed it to be a good measure of seriousness.

22

Court has recognized in cases like Blanton versus City

23

of North Las Vegas that the term of imprisonment that a

24

legislature chooses is a good measure of the seriousness

25

of the offense.

This

There may be offenses that a State
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

classifies as more or less serious based on punishment,

2

but Congress wanted to do its best to get uniformity in

3

provision -- in this provision.

4

to take out this requirement that would look to varying

5

State and foreign laws and instead have one that was

6

just based on term of imprisonment.

7

So what it did here was

And actually this -- this raises a very

8

serious problem with Petitioner's reading of the

9

statute, which is with respect to foreign offenses.

The

10

"felony drug offense" definition allows an enhancement

11

based on State, Federal or foreign offenses, and the

12

definition of "felony" unadorned and standing by itself

13

doesn't refer to foreign offenses at all, which means

14

that there is a serious ambiguity if both apply as to

15

what would be done in the case of trying to enhance

16

based on a foreign offense.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, I suppose it might

18

for countries that use that classification, for common

19

law countries.

20

MS. SAHARSKY:

There are countries that do

21

use the felony- misdemeanor distinction.

22

that do not.

23

the change Congress made to be one that eliminates those

24

kinds of ambiguities.

25

There are some

But we understand in 1994 that Congress -

And certainly, if Congress had thought in
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

1994 that both the separate definition of felony and the

2

definition of felony drug offense mattered, that it

3

would have placed foreign offenses in the definition of

4

felony, and it didn't do that here.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the information we

6

have in the brief says that there are two States that

7

have dropped those labels.

8

Jersey and Maine?

9
10
11

MS. SAHARSKY:

Are there more than New

New Jersey and Maine are the

only ones that I'm aware of.
Certainly, as this Court discussed in some

12

previous questions, there may be ways in which courts

13

could try to work around ambiguities that, for example,

14

existed in the statute 1990 -- prior to 1994, to figure

15

out how offenses in New Jersey should be treated.

16

the fact that Congress made the change in 1994 to pick

17

clear language that would just turn on the authorized

18

term of imprisonment shows that that's what should be

19

used, that choice should be given effect.

20

But

The fact that courts might be able to deal

21

with an ambiguous statute certainly does not give

22

license to create one where it doesn't otherwise exist.

23

There's an example the Petitioner raised,

24

which is how violent felonies are treated in the Armed

25

Career Criminal Act, and I think that that -- that
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

illustrates how Congress could have done what Petitioner

2

wanted if that was, in fact, its intent.

3

violent felony, which could be the basis for a sentence

4

enhancement, is defined as various violent offenses that

5

are punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.

6

then Congress specifically decided that it wanted to

7

exempt state misdemeanor offenses that it didn't

8

consider serious enough to qualify as violent felonies.

9

So it exempted State offenses that are classified as

In the ACCA, a

But

10

misdemeanors and punishable by less than two years.

11

we think that the Congress' treatment in the ACCA

12

exempting specific State offenses shows that if Congress

13

had wanted to exempt offenses classified as misdemeanors

14

in the way that Petitioner suggests, then it would have

15

done so in that way.

16

Congress chose a meaning here for "felony

17

drug offense" and we think that it needs to be given

18

effect.

19

You want us to

The government After we said in

Granderson the rule of lenity applies without qualifying
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

or modifying it at all.

2

MS. SAHARSKY:

The government's position is

3

that the rule of lenity operates in the same manner in

4

both the defining the offense context and in the

5

sentencing context.

6

our brief is that the purposes behind the rule of lenity

7

are really implicated to a lesser extent when we're

8

talking about sentencing, and particularly with respect

9

to mandatory minimums, because there's not a question of

The point that we were making in

10

whether the offense conduct at issue is illegal, and

11

there's not a question about the maximum offense, the

12

maximum term of imprisonment that the person could be

13

subject to.

14

So, our brief should be best understood as a

15

response to Petitioner's extensive historical discussion

16

of the rule of lenity and a suggestion that it applies

17

with even more vigor in the context of mandatory

18

minimums.

19

the same time we are not suggesting there is a new

20

different rule of lenity in this context.

21

We don't think that that's the case, but at

And again, we don't see this as a rule of
