Mr. Bouffard?

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDRE D. BOUFFARD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BOUFFARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The issue in this case is whether Section

12

14501 of the United States Transportation Code expressly

13

preempts the Respondent's State law consumer protection

14

in tort claims for damages against a tow trucker who

15

towed his vehicle lawfully and then, several months

16

later, disposed of the vehicle after the fees for towing

17

and storage had not been paid.

18

Both of these claims are preempted because

19

they are directed at the conduct -- the type of conduct

20

that tow truck companies all over this country every day

21

engage in, in dealing with a particular type of tow

22

that's referred to in the business as nonconsensual

23

tows.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Bouffard, this law,

this New Hampshire law, it regulates storage.

Alderson Reporting Company

Is this a

Official
Page 4

1

law that applies only to the towing companies who tow

2

the automobile and then store it, or does the law apply,

3

say, to a garage, say, someone brings a car to a garage

4

for repairs, and does this storage law regulate garage

5

operations as well as towing operations?

6

MR. BOUFFARD:

Justice Ginsburg, this law

7

regulates abandoned motor vehicles.

8

motor vehicle law.

9
10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's an abandoned

So -- so it would apply

to a garage operator.
MR. BOUFFARD:

Well, if a garage operator

12

came into possession of an abandoned motor vehicle, then

13

I suppose it would.

14

title to this subchapter of this New Hampshire statute,

15

the title is abandoned vehicles, Your Honor.

16

If -- if you look at the -- at the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but what made it

17

abandoned was that they tried to locate the owner,

18

couldn't and so -- this same thing could happen with a

19

garage owner as happened to the towing truck.

20

there's nothing peculiar about being in the towing

21

business that makes this storage application -- storage

22

statute apply.

So

23

MR. BOUFFARD:

Well, let me be clear about

24

this statute, Your Honor.

25

statute, and what's really important to understand with

It's an abandoned vehicle

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 5

1

this case is that none of the Plaintiff's claims rely on

2

this abandoned vehicle statute.

3

The Plaintiff has pled in his complaint a

4

couple of allegations of violations of this abandoned

5

vehicle law, but the substantive rights that were sued

6

upon by the Plaintiff in this case do not live in the

7

abandoned motor vehicle law.

8
9

The substantive rights that were sued upon
by the Plaintiff live in the State's consumer protection

10

law, which is a separate New Hampshire statute,

11

unrelated to the abandoned vehicle law.

12

the claim that the -- the common law negligence claim in

13

this case arises out of the common law of New Hampshire.

14

It doesn't arise out of the abandoned motor vehicle law.

15

And secondly,

One of the sources of confusion, I would

16

submit, in the New Hampshire Supreme Court's decision is

17

that it did not adequately deal with the -- the role of

18

the abandoned vehicle law in this case.

19

vehicle law actually plays a relatively minor role as it

20

relates to the causes of action that were pled in this

21

case and the causes of action that the preemption

22

defense is directed to in this case.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

point?

25

further removed.

The abandoned

What's -- what's your

If it's not part of the towing law, then it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 6

MR. BOUFFARD:

1

The reason -- the reason why

2

these claims are preempted, Your Honor, is because they

3

all stem from the towing of the vehicle, which was

4

followed by the storage of the vehicle.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess, I mean, I guess

6

you could have thousands of claims across the country,

7

millions of claims where there are all kinds of towing

8

laws.

9

park your car here during a snow emergency, it will be

And -- you know, it says in Cambridge, Massachusetts

10

towed.

Probably every northeastern country has laws

11

like that.

12

negligence claims when the thing is towed, the guy broke

13

a headlight.

I guess there could be millions of

MR. BOUFFARD:

15

different -JUSTICE BREYER:

17

preempted?

And are all those things

I would be amazed.
MR. BOUFFARD:

18
19

Well, I think that's a

I don't think so, Your Honor.

We're not -JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Then what's the difference

21

between this and -- and what could arise any day of the

22

week?

23

that all the northeast statutes that say your car will

24

be towed if you park here during a snow emergency, what

25

happens?

I mean, as I read your brief, I -- are you saying

I mean, do they have to go to the Department

Alderson Reporting Company

of Transportation?

Boston couldn't function.

2

that they do tow cars.

3

I've seen it.

I don't know that firsthand, but

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

I know

So how's it supposed to

work?
MR. BOUFFARD:

There's no -- there's no

8

claim in this case, Your Honor, that the abandoned motor

9

vehicle law is preempted, that New Hampshire's abandoned

10
11

motor vehicle law -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, all right, there

12

isn't in this case, but I'm curious to know how it works

13

because it seemed to me from what you're arguing, all

14

the abandoned motor vehicle laws and all the snow

15

emergency towing and everything else that I see every

16

day would be preempted a fortiori.

17

it all works.

18

MR. BOUFFARD:

So you tell me how

We are arguing that the

19

causes of action that were pled in this case, which are

20

a Consumer Protection Act claim for damages and

21

attorneys' fees -- treble damages actually in the

22

Consumer Protection Act claim.

That claim is predicated

23

on the consumer protection law.

It's predicated on the

24

State of New Hampshire's policy protecting consumers.

25

Now, there's -- there's an allegation in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 8

1

complaint that there was also -- there happened to be a

2

violation of this abandoned vehicle law.

3

completely meaningless allegation as it relates to the

4

Consumer Protection Act because even if it were a

5

violation of the abandoned vehicle law, that would not

6

make it a violation of the consumer protection law.

7

Consumer protection laws are intended to regulate

8

fairness in business practices.

9

statute is about.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that is a

That's what that

My question is -- is the

11

same as Justice Breyer's.

12

running in the wrong direction.

13

the case doesn't involve New Hampshire's towing law but

14

involves just its general consumer protection law,

15

it's -- it's even further distant from being preempted.

16

I --

17

It seems to me you are

MR. BOUFFARD:

To the extent you say

Well, there's a difference,

18

Your Honor, Justice Scalia, between whether the case is

19

predicated on the New Hampshire towing law and whether

20

or not these causes of action are related to the towing

21

of the vehicle.

22

that all of these claims are related to, within the

23

meaning of this statute, to the towing of the vehicle.

24
25

Our point, and our primary argument, is

JUSTICE SCALIA:
My goodness.

Suppose -- I understand.

Suppose a vehicle -- I pay for somebody to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 9

1

tow -- I agree that somebody will tow my vehicle and I

2

will pay him $100.

3

my garage and says, give me the $100.

4

ha, I'm not going to give you $100.

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And he tows the vehicle, puts it in
And I say, ha,

Now, you think that that

7

general obligation under State law to pay a debt that

8

you've contracted to pay is eliminated?

9
10

MR. BOUFFARD:

That's a very different set

of circumstances, Justice Scalia.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why is that different from

12

normal consumer protection law?

13

it's so much different.

14

MR. BOUFFARD:

I -- I don't see that

Well, this -- this case

15

involves a nonconsensual tow.

This case involves a

16

situation where there was an opportunity, a fair

17

opportunity, to pay for the towing and the storage

18

charges that had been incurred, and --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

What difference does that

20

make?

22

24 hours and if it wasn't picked up they would

23

immediately sell it for parts.

Your argument would be that's preempted by
the Federal statute?

the -- what a private plaintiff can't do in a case like

this is assert claims like common law negligence

MR. BOUFFARD:

There -- there's a letter in

whether the services include storage, which is what the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

property or towing doesn't include services for storage.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why don't you answer

11

that question?

12

preempted, they have to do with storage during

13

transportation.

14

that?

15

As I read the list of things that are

Why should we read it more broadly than

MR. BOUFFARD:

I think -- Justice Sotomayor,

16

I think you are referring to the argument that's been

17

made by my friends with regard to the final phrase in

18

the statute with respect to transportation --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. BOUFFARD:

Exactly.

And the short answer to that

21

question is that the term "transportation" is a defined

22

term in Title 49, and it's defined very broadly for --

23

for good reason because that term is used throughout

24

Title 49.

25

of jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, and

In fact, the term is used to define the scope

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 15

1

the definition of transportation is quite broad, and --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It -- it includes storage,

3

is the point you are coming to, right?

4

MR. BOUFFARD:

That's correct.
The definition includes

14

If that company picks up some

See, I thought the storage was -- was

16

when you're -- you know, changing the mode of

21

company, if you pick up goods and bring it to the place

22

where you store it, that's covered by -- by this

23

statute.

24
25

Sometimes

That's how I would read

But you're saying, even if you're a storage

MR. BOUFFARD:
saying, Your Honor.

No, that's not what I'm

I'm saying that if you tow a motor

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 16

1

vehicle, you bring the motor vehicle into your

2

possession via towing and, as is the case here, you also

3

store the vehicle.

4

this, where the claimant was seeking to have the vehicle

5

returned to his place of business -- to his place of

6

residence, those are the facts of this case.

7

And in particular in a case like

This wasn't necessarily the end of the

8

transportation.

The plaintiff here, the Respondent, was

9

asking for further transportation services at the end of

10

the day.

11

transportation hadn't ended.

12

a situation where there would have been no further

13

transportation.

14

So on the facts of this case, the
But even if -- we do have

The -- the reading that my friends have

15

advocated inserts the word "incidental" to -- to

16

transportation in the statute that doesn't appear in the

17

statute.

18

The definition of "transportation" doesn't

19

include the word -- doesn't say "storage incidental to

20

the movement of property."

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Let's say you park

22

your tow trucks on somebody else's parking lot, and you

23

don't pay the rent.

So they sell your tow truck.

I don't think so, Your Honor,

2

within what Congress intended by the term "services"

3

there.

4

you've described, Mr. Chief Justice, is a claim that

5

would really be a -- a breach of contract claim between

6

the tow truck owners and his landlord.

7

a -- a contract dispute.

8

to the transportation services of the -- of the tow

9

truck company in a way that is picked up by this

10
11

That -- that claim -- that claim that -- that

That would be

It wouldn't -- wouldn't relate

preemption statute.
It relates to it in a very tangential way,

12

in a very remote way, I suppose, but not -- not in a way

13

that's close enough -- not in a way that -- that relates

14

to the business of a tow truck company in the way that

15

payment disputes over -- over the services relate to the

16

business of the tow truck company.

17

There are any number of different types of

18

disputes that motor carriers, like tow truck companies,

19

could get involved in that wouldn't be preempted here.

20

Motor carriers are involved in lots of different types

21

of business activity that doesn't involve the delivery

22

of their services.

23

estate transaction, for example.

24
25

They could be involved in a real

a very remote sense, they -- those -- those disputes

might be related to the business of -- of the motor

carrier.

6

claim arises out of the actual delivery of the

transportation services.

Those

It's very remote, unlike a situation where the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How does -- so if

your tow truck is involved in an accident, is that -and a suit is filed for negligence.
MR. BOUFFARD:

Is that preempted?

I don't think that's

12

preempted, Your Honor.

13

that is because there's a whole line of Court of

14

Appeals' decisions in the airline area that deal with

15

negligence claims arising out of the negligent operation

16

of the aircraft.

17

operation of a tow truck as opposed to an aircraft.

18

I -- I -- and the reason I say

And your scenario is the negligent

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm just looking at

19

the statutory language.

It says -- you know, "related

20

to a service of a motor carrier with respect to the

21

transportation of property," and you know, your motor --

22

your truck is involved in transporting property.

23

the claim against you, that you don't -- you don't

24

render good service because you're negligent in a -- and

25

it just seems to me to fit within the terms of the

Alderson Reporting Company

That's

statute, if you adopt as broad a reading as you adopt.
MR. BOUFFARD:

Well, literally, I think

3

you're -- you're right, Your Honor, that -- that the

4

scenario you describe could fall within the literal

5

language of the statute, but the Court has said that we

6

can't go -- we can't necessarily go to the literal end

I think those words came from your dissent in that case.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. BOUFFARD:

No, no.

No, I don't say that

12

they were wrong, Justice Scalia.

13

though -- do though is I would point the Court to the

14

language of the statute, and not only the -- not only

the specific statute involved here, the motor carrier

very similar, general -- broad, general, preemptive

23

language.

24

provisions in 41713 contains limiting language that --

that -- that would limit the scope of preemption in any

way.

2

The -- the -- and we know from the -- the

3

legislative intent with regard to the statute involved

4

in this case directly that Congress intended that the

5

scope of preemption for all of these different kinds of

6

industries would be coextensive.

7

was trying to achieve with this statute, was to give

8

motor carriers the same breadth of protection through

9

preemption that air carriers enjoy and that hybrid air

10

That's what Congress

and motor carriers enjoy.

11

And so if there are no -- if there are no

12

limitations with regard to air carriers and -- and

13

hybrid air motor carriers of -- of the type that are

14

suggested by my friends for motor carriers, then -- then

15

that language at the end of 14501 can't be interpreted

16

in a -- in a strictly limiting fashion.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, there's a lot of

18

language in the majority pretty much along the line that

19

Justice Scalia said.

20

I mean, Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority, and she said

21

the reference to regulatory authority of a State, which

22

is a different reference, I agree, should be read to

23

preserve, not preempt traditional prerogative for the

24

State.

25

And not sure if that's your point.

And Justice White said previously that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 22

1

have to start with the idea that this is -- historic

2

police powers of the State are not going to be

3

superseded by the Act, unless it's a clear manifest

4

purpose of Congress.

5

So I guess the problem is, with a lot of the

6

other things, that you yourself are in an area that is a

7

traditional matter of State regulation.

8

regulated in a way that applies to everybody.

9

indirectly related to the transport itself, and that it

It is, in fact,
It is

10

takes place on -- about storage that took place after

11

the event.

12

So you have all that working against you.
Now, the Columbus case does offer some hope

13

for the other side, I would think.

think?

15

MR. BOUFFARD:

But what do you

Well, Justice Breyer, let me

16

just say, first of all, that -- that consumer protection

17

is -- is -- I'm not sure I would concede that consumer

18

protection is -- is an area of traditional State

19

regulation.

20

protection law dates to 1970, and the Federal government

21

has largely occupied the field of motor carrier

22

transportation since 1935 with the enactment of the

23

Motor Vehicle Act in that year.

24
25

In fact, the New Hampshire consumer

distinction that fails to take into account the broad

9

definition of "transportation" in Federal law.

If the Court has --

But why should the tow

operation be treated any different from the garage when

13

they're doing the identical thing, that is, storing and

14

then selling the vehicle?

15

MR. BOUFFARD:

Well, if a -- if a person has

16

brought their vehicle into a garage, Justice Ginsburg,

17

there's been no transportation by a motor carrier.

18

difference is that in this case this whole scenario

started out with a transportation by a -- by a motor

carrier which also, once it had possession of the

21

vehicle, stored it.

The

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

13

Transferring title and disposing of

Mr. Pelkey's car against his will and not compensating

him for the loss of his personal property is not a

service of a motor carrier with respect to

transportation of property.

18

State-created property interests is a field of

19

traditional State regulation, and the broad sweep

characterization of my brother with respect to what RSA

And I would disagree with the

RSA 262 talks about removed vehicles.

Alderson Reporting Company

It

6

operator.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It does

But it seems to me

8

that you can't ignore the fact that part of what tow

9

trucks do is store things.

I mean, it's a necessary and

10

integral part of the motor service, the transportation

11

of property, that they do.

12

storage will affect the services that they provide.

And regulation of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, we would say -It's not just

like -- it's not just like storing anything else.
MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

Well, respectfully,

17

Mr. Chief Justice, we would say that storage is a

18

separate service altogether.

19

transportation -- and this is another place where I

20

would disagree with the characterization by my brother

21

with respect to the definition of "transportation."

22

believe the definition of "transportation" specifically

23

refers to a "motor carrier," meaning a person providing

24

motor vehicle transportation for compensation, but also

25

relates to the movement of the passengers and the

And the act of

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official
Page 27

1

property, and the services related to that movement.

2

So the very definition that applies to this

3

case and to the transportation services relate to the

4

movement of the property.

5

Here the movement has stopped.

And the

6

storage that we are dealing with in this case is

7

precisely the storage that is in RSA 262, which is the

8

storage charges, not for the movement of the property.

9

So I would clarify, Mr. Chief Justice, that it is our

10

position that the transportation, with respect to the

11

transportation of property which Justice Scalia has

12

aptly pointed out, severely limits the scope of this

13

preemption statute.

14

The services of the motor carrier terminated

Official
Page 28

1

related to the motor carrier service you have to either

2

directly regulate that service or it has an indirect

3

connection with the service that significantly affects

4

the service.

5

In your example, it would be a direct

6

regulation.

You're actually requiring a motor carrier

7

to actually provide a service that the marketplace

8

itself wouldn't provide or that the motor carrier would

9

not otherwise provide.

So that is a direct regulation

10

or an example of directly regulating that would be

11

preempted under this statute.

12

with here, is the storage afterward, is not that motor

13

carrier service.

14

at the end with respect to --

15

But what we are dealing

And I do believe the ­- the language

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do we draw the line,

16

that line that you just asked us to draw between direct

17

and indirect?

How do we articulate that line?

18

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The direct -Because now you're --

20

now you're articulating a different line.

21

saying this -- the hypothetical that Justice Kagan

22

posited is not storage-related, it is something

23

else-related.

24

difference?

25

It's towing-related.

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

What's the

Correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

You are

The way I -- the

Official
Page 29

1

way I interpreted the hypothetical is the State is then

2

saying in order as a precondition to or as part of the

3

motor carrier service of transporting or towing that

4

vehicle, you also must provide this other service over

5

here, which is actually one of the problems with the

6

Rowe case and under the Maine State statute.

7

Maine State law what they were requiring the motor

8

carrier to do in Rowe was actually to provide the

9

verification service.

10

Under

And so that was a direct

regulation I believe that this Court found under Rowe.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You've just told us

12

anything that significantly affects the transportation

13

service is covered.

14

argument is, is that this significantly affects the

15

service, whether he can collect for the storage

16

after -- you know, after the -- after towing it by -- by

17

selling it, and by selling it on terms that are not so

18

onerous as to impinge upon his -- his ability to run the

19

business.

20

And I think what your brother's

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

Well, it may impinge upon

21

his ability or impinge upon how much he can collect.

22

may impinge upon those things, Your Honor.

23

doesn't affect the service of the motor carrier with

24

respect to the transportation of the property because

25

that's the movement of the property.

Alderson Reporting Company

But it

It

Official
Page 30

of the service that anybody provides, but that is

getting too attenuated, that's getting too far out.

That's getting towards --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it isn't

7

Federal Aviation Administration Act.

8

adopt is going to apply to air transportation as well.

9

Whatever rule we

And is your position, for example, that

10

things related to a hangar at an airport, that those are

11

not covered by this at all?

12

the connection between the transportation and the

13

storage, the storage of the airplane, you can see a

14

little bit more clearly how that would affect what the

15

airplane -- you know, can do.

16

the airplane out of the hangar because you didn't pay

17

the rent or whatever.

18

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

It seems to me that there

A lien -- you can't take

There is an effect there,

19

and I do believe that this Court started drawing that

20

line actually in the Travelers case.

21

Travelers case looked at this "related to," that's

22

what's causing the problem, "related to" and what does

23

"related to" mean?

24

actually use "related to" to its extreme, everything is

25

related to everything else.

And when the

And as has been pointed out, if you

That has been said several

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 31

1

times in the case law.

2

But "related to" in Travelers, I believe in

3

that case the Court looked at -- there was attention to

4

that type of broad sweep of "related to" and the

5

presumption against preemption, which says we're not

6

going to preempt, but "related to" seems we are

7

preempting everything.

8
9

So there was a tension.

So in Travelers we went to, well, we have to
take a look at what the manifest intent of Congress was

10

for the regulatory scheme.

11

intent of Congress, and certainly the best place to look

12

for that intent is first in the words that are used.

13

You have to look at the

But once we are looking at the intent, we

14

have to say does the actual thing that is being

15

regulated by the State, and they are putting in their

16

own policies by direct regulation by a positive

17

enactment, does it affect or significantly affect the

18

deregulatory purposes.

19

that was adopted in Rowe.

20

And I believe that's the line

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, don't lose

21

that.

I will ask you this question to, which favors you

If you start talking about significant

I can't believe that.

So there is much more in significance in

And now, do you want to, in light of what my

17

concern is, add anything to what you say.

18

not, the Solicitor General might, but I'd like to hear

19

anything you have to say about that.

20

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

And you may

Well, believe -- I believe

21

with respect to RSA 262, which is the statute that is in

22

this case, it doesn't require a tow truck company to do

23

anything.

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, you -- you can just

rest on that, but I'm going to have -- or somebody's

Alderson Reporting Company

say that, but I -- I don't see I can -- my own problem

3

is not being able to have an intelligent answer to that

4

without having some answer to the bigger picture.

5

the bigger picture seems to me horrendously important.

6

And -- and I don't know what that answer is.

7

And we could just

You seem to be getting there with the words

8

"deregulatory purpose."

9

we might try to work with those, but go ahead.

10
11

And

And I -- and I was thinking how

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

Well, I think it's -- it

is an easier case in this case under the FAAAA -JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, I think it's much

harder than this case --

14

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I --- because the relationship

16

is -- is in the -- in the more general case is more

17

direct to the tow truck.

18

that's -- that's why I need some kind of bigger picture.

19
20
21

It says "go tow."

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

And

I'm getting lost in the

"go tow" command, if you will.
JUSTICE BREYER:

We have a statute which

22

says, if you park your car here for more than 3 hours,

23

you will be towed, okay?

24

though we don't see it, there is an arrangement for the

25

service of the city with the tow truck company, which

And as part of that statute,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 34

1

says when the parking person calls you and says -- the

2

meter says red, yellow, purple, green, you are to go

3

there and tow, okay?

4

Doesn't that sound as if it's regulating the

5

service of tow trucks?

And I suspect across the

6

country, there is some variation on that theme, but

7

there are thousands of them.

8

would be repeating it -- the words of this case may

9

affect that situation, I want to know what you know,

And since the words -- I

10

which may not be very much -- I don't blame you -- about

11

that broader situation.

12

MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

Well, thank you for the

13

out, Justice Breyer.

14

I'm getting lost is -- and I understand the -- the

15

example having to do with the City of Cambridge having

16

no -- no parking, and if you're there for 3 hours, that

17

allows -- there is this -- statutes that allow the tow

18

truck operator, the motor carrier, to go and collect

19

that under a nonconsensual tow.

20

is a special animal, unfortunately, because there are no

21

market forces in play there.

22

But again, I -- I -- the reason

And a nonconsensual tow

But I don't believe that that's affecting

23

the motor carrier service.

There is nothing that forces

24

that tow truck carrier to go out and actually undertake

25

that tow.

And if they do undertake the tow or do the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 35

business or whatnot, then certainly, they would be under

2

whatever obligations that the State has.

3
4

And that's one of the problems I think we
have --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think that

6

Justice Breyer is -- I may be speaking for him -- he's

7

thinking that that State contract or that State

8

regulation that permits towing companies to do this is

9

preempted in some way.

5

problem.

6

Related to -- related to -That's the

It's the "related to" words.
MR. SHAUGHNESSY:

Correct.

And then we go

7

back to the instructions in Rowe, which -- which

8

provided the framework that when you're interpreting

9

related to, you go:

One, is it direct -- directly

10

regulating or directly affecting service; or, if it's an

11

indirect effect, which obviously it can be, it has to

12

have a significant impact on the services.

13

And then there's the ultimate out of Morales

14

that says if it's -- it could certainly connect, but if

15

it's too far attenuated to the purposes of Congress,

16

it's just not going to be done.

17

I know that doesn't help with the line

18

drawing in -- in connection of the gray area that we're

19

dealing with in this case, but I do believe in this

20

particular case, it is easier because we have that --

21

those words of limitation, "with respect to the

22

transportation of property" are words of limitation, and

23

they are not present in the ADA, and they were not

24

present with the ERISA cases, which deals with a broad

25

regulatory scheme with long history and other things

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 38

2

that apply.
We don't have that in this case.

I believe

3

the New Hampshire Supreme Court got it right when they

4

were focusing on actually what is a service of a motor

5

carrier, and I believe we do have words of limitation in

6

this particular case.

7

So what the Supreme Court of New Hampshire

8

said is, "The manner in which a company in possession of

9

a towed vehicle may" -- not must -- "may dispose of the

10

vehicle to collect on a debt created by the operation of

11

State law is far removed from Congress's aim of

12

promoting free markets and equalizing the competitive

13

playing -- playing field between motor carriers and air

14

carriers, and help assure transportation rate services

15

reflect maximum reliance on -- on forces."

16

I also believe that the Petitioner has

17

basically given up the case and conceded the case in

18

several places in their brief and in here in oral

19

argument today.

20

Petitioner's brief, it says that most -- that "The most

21

that Dan's City really can say is that the services

22

within the meaning of Section 14501(c)(1) includes

23

activities that are incidental and distinct from the

24

actual transportation services."

25

If you look at page 34 of the

So the Petitioner's brief is calling the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

stopped.

3

distinct.

And -- and they call it incidental and

4

In the reply brief at page 21, they say,

5

"Moreover, criminal laws prohibiting theft are not the

6

kind of burdensome State economic regulation Congress

7

sought to prevent with the FAAAA, nor are abandoned

8

vehicle laws such as New Hampshire Chapter 262 in its

9

regulations which do not hamper the operations of tow

10

truckers.

Instead they establish procedures for the

11

efficient handling and disposition of abandoned

12

vehicles."

13

So they're conceding that RSA 262 in this

14

case, the statute does not have a significant impact,

15

so this is not a clear case.

16
17

I see I have more time, but I think I've
made all my points, if there are no more questions.

21

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

22
23
24
25

Thank you, counsel.

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. YELIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Congress deregulated the trucking industry

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 40

1

to eliminate undue interference with market forces and

2

consumer choice.

3

cannot operate on the sale of nonconsensually towed

4

cars, and there's little reason to think that Congress

5

intended to preempt State laws that regulate that

6

conduct.

7

But market forces and consumer choice

This Court in this case, as in many

8

preemption cases involving the phrase "related to," must

9

engage in a -- in a process of sensible line drawing.

10

Everything is related to everything else in

11

the literal sense.

12

that the Court should not -- courts should not use

13

uncritical literalism in determining the scope of a

14

preemption provision.

15

And the Court in Travelers suggested

I think that this Court does have some work

16

to do in this case, but a lot of the groundwork has

17

already been laid in the Rowe case.

18

held that a State law is related to a motor carrier

19

service if the State law either directly regulates the

20

service or if it has an indirect connection with the

21

service and a significant -- forbidden significant

22

effect on Congress's deregulatory and preemptive

23

objectives.

24
25

In Rowe, this Court

I think -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Storage is part of what tow trucks do.

that -- you know, cross-country trucks don't.

3

seems to me if you have a local jurisdiction who figures

4

out, well, this is a great way to make a lot of money

5

or -- you know, to give -- or the other way -- you know,

6

you can charge -- charge a lot because we want to keep

7

8

directly related to the service they provide?

9

MR. YELIN:

Maybe in a way
And it

I mean, why isn't that fairly

It's certainly a foreseeable

10

service that could be provided.

The question is whether

11

it has a sufficient locus to the transportation itself.

12

I think there are indications in the statute

13

itself and the statutory purposes which suggest that the

14

Court should view service as a separate type of service,

15

independent and distinct from transportation, at least

16

in the towing context where the motor transportation has

17

ceased.

18

The reason for that, Your Honor --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

just said.

I don't understand what you

Say it again.
MR. YELIN:

Yes, sir.

I think that there

22

are reasons in the statutory text itself and in the

23

statutory objectives for viewing service as

24

independent -- excuse me, storage --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Service where?

Alderson Reporting Company

3

MR. YELIN:

I misspoke, Justice Scalia.

Storage --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. YELIN:

Storage, ah.

I see.

-- as independent of

6

transportation.

And the reasons for that are as

7

follows:

8

The statute defines "transportation" as "services

9

related to the transportation of property."

First, let me start with the statutory text.

And for ­

10

and storage has been in the Interstate Commerce Act for

11

over 100 years, the term "storage."

12

years this Court has construed disputes concerning

13

storage and considered whether or not Federal law

14

governed or State law governed.

15

And for over 100

When the storage was before delivery of a

16

package, for example, the storage was considered to be

17

storage in transit and it was part of the transportation

18

itself.

19

that was a separate service not connected with the

20

transportation.

21

But if the storage occurred after delivery,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Yelin, I gave

22

Mr. Shaughnessy a couple of hypotheticals about very

23

onerous regulations involving storage after the towing

24

that might very conceivably have an effect on the tower,

25

drive up the tower's prices, conceivably even drive the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 43

1

tower out of the market.

2

between this and those kinds of things?

3

MR. YELIN:

So how do we draw the line as

So I have two points that I

4

would like to make with respect to that, Your Honor.

5

The first is that I think the hypotheticals you gave are

6

much more difficult cases and could very well cross the

7

line if a State tried to indirectly influence towers.

8

For example, let's assume, if I may elaborate on your

9

hypothetical, that a State really disliked the practice

10

of nonconsensual towing, and really wanted to try and

11

reign it in and so imposed certain conditions on towers

12

that would discourage them from engaging in this

13

particular type of service.

14

I think that would be an indirect type of

15

regulation, but it would, as a matter of fact, it really

16

would impair the ability or the interest of towers to

17

provide this service to --

18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do we discover that?

Do we look into the city council hearings or what?

20

MR. YELIN:

I think in part, Your Honor --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I want to be able to

22

look at the law and say the law is preempted or the law

23

isn't preempted.

24

of the law is this or that.

25

able to do.

Don't tell me -- you know, the purpose
That's not something I am

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 44

MR. YELIN:

Your Honor, I think some of

2

these preemption questions necessarily are factual in

3

part in nature.

4

service of the motor carrier is affected by an indirect

5

statute is --

6

The Court, to consider whether or not a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, that's factual.

But

whether the intent of the city council was this or that

11

part of the inquiry.

12
13
14

Oh, no.

That's right, Your

And I didn't mean to suggest that that would be

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought that is what you

meant.
MR. YELIN:

No, Your Honor.

The question is

15

whether it would have that effect, that factual effect.

16

And if I may, I think it's critical in this case to

17

point out that Petitioner has conceded at page 21 of its

18

reply brief that laws like Chapter 262 do not hamper

19

towing industry practices.

20

Towing and Recovery Association explains that laws like

21

this provide a critical backbone for nonconsensual

22

towing services.

23

And Respondent's amicus

In the absence --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I mean,

24

maybe these, but you can easily imagine that these types

25

of laws would be subject to abuse and would have an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 45

1

adverse impact on the towing company and, therefore, on

2

the transportation of property.

3

MR. YELIN:

And if there were such abusive

4

laws, Your Honor, and if they do impair the

5

transportation of property and the services that a tower

6

was willing to provide, I think that the Court would

7

likely consider those cases and consider those --

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, now we only --

now we not only have to decide whether this type of law

10

is related to it, but once we say some of those laws

11

might be and some won't be, depending upon the impact in

12

a particular case.

13

MR. YELIN:

Your Honor, I think every law

14

has to be considered in its application, and I think

15

that, for example, in Morales, the Court just didn't

16

consider --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Every law doesn't

18

have to be considered in its application.

If you say

19

you can't speak out on the sidewalk, it doesn't matter

20

what they apply it, you can consider that law

21

absolutely.

22

MR. YELIN:

Fair enough, Your Honor.

23

comment was too broad.

24

will be obvious.

25

industries, for example, a State law that flatly

My

What I would say is some laws

Those that directly regulate towing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 46

1

prohibits nonconsensual towing would be the type of

2

direct regulation which is proscribed by this preemption

3

clause.
When you are talking about indirect

4
5

regulation, however, that perhaps is where I think one

6

needs to consider it on an as-applied basis because

7

indirect regulation by definition is not going to have

8

an obvious direct limit on towing services and the

9

question the Court will have to consider is whether the

10

indirect regulation is sufficiently onerous that it does

11

impair the provision of towing services.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

we have two choices.

It seems to me that there -­

In Morales, since I can mock my own

14

opinions, I wrote at the end, "it's not -- when it's too

15

tenuous, remote or peripheral."

That's singularly unhelpful.

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

It seems to -- there --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought so at the time.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

There are two directions you could go.

Yes, you were right.
But

22

first I would like to know, it seems my guess is it is

23

universally thought by cities that this Act does not

24

preempt their normal parking regulations.

25

about that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Am I right

Official
Page 47

1
2
3

MR. YELIN:

You are right about that, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Then we either have

4

to take this tenuous, et cetera, this is too much, this

5

isn't too much, da, da, da, or you've given -- there is

6

another thought being thrown out and that is you relate

7

it to the basic purposes of the deregulation act and you

8

say that where the city is regulating something that

9

never was, could not be, and is not part of a regulated

10

or deregulated market, i.e. has nothing to do with the

11

subject matter, then it is not preempted.

12

Now, do you want us to take that approach?

13

Should we punt and just use the words like "tenuous"

14

or -- and if we take the implicit suggestion, what's the

15

right way to do it?

16

MR. YELIN:

Your Honor, I think the two

17

alternatives you sketched are not mutually exclusive.

18

In fact, I think they support each other.

19

that when a State law does not have a significant effect

20

on Congress's deregulatory and preemptive objectives, it

21

is by definition going to be too tenuously connected to

22

the motor carrier services.

I believe

23

I would propose, Your Honor, that in this

24

context, where the Department of Transportation would

25

have no regulatory authority and where there is no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 48

1

private market that could fill the vacuum that would be

2

created by the removal of State laws creating the

3

structure for the private choices that are undertaken

4

here, this would be a prime example.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it would depend upon how

6

severe the consumer protection law is, is that right?

7

If it's a consumer protection law that really whacks the

8

tow truck operator, that would be different from a

9

moderate, benign consumer protection law?

We have to

10

examine each consumer protection law on its own, is that

11

it?

12

MR. YELIN:

I think the answer has to be

13

yes, Justice Scalia.

14

considered the application of the consumer protection

15

law where the States were trying to use specific

16

guidelines.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. BOUFFARD

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. BOUFFARD:

Thank you.

15

Let me take a couple of moments to try to

16

address some of the questions that seem to be troubling

17

some of the Justices.

18

Justice Breyer, the simple answer to why

19

local traffic safety laws wouldn't be preempted is that

20

there's an exemption for the safety regulatory authority

21

of States in the statute.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. BOUFFARD:

Thank you.
And, Justice Kagan, the

24

reason why this -- this case goes over the line and is

25

preempted is because what the Plaintiff's damages claims

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 50

1

in this case seek to do is they seek to enforce duties

2

that go well beyond what even the New Hampshire

3

abandoned vehicle law requires.

4

They seek to impose duties of reasonable

5

care to seek out the owner of the vehicle; they --

6

the -- the -- the negligence claim seeks to impose a

7

duty to act -- a duty of reasonable care in disposing of

8

the vehicle; and -- and a duty of reasonable care to

9

return the vehicle to Mr. Pelkey.

10

And those duties and what has been a breach

11

of those duties will be determined by a jury.

12

when tow truckers are faced in the future with having to

13

live up to those sets of duties, they will never know

14

whether or not, in any given situation, their conduct

15

will be second-guessed as having been not reasonable by

16

a jury and they will be subjected to damages claims by

17

plaintiffs.

18

rule is very simple in New Hampshire and under -- and in

19

Under the -- the abandoned vehicle law, the

It's a very simple rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

invoking that statute in order to be able to sell the

24

car, but wants to have enforced only the parts that are

25

favorable to the tow operation.

And the -- the regime

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 51

1

in New Hampshire is, yes, you can sell the vehicle, but

2

this is how you do it.

3

not how it was done here.

4

MR. BOUFFARD:

And it seems to me that that's

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

5

actually, the -- the tower here wasn't invoking the law,

6

the tower was simply following what the law says in

7

terms of the process.

8

When -- when a person comes into possession of another's

9

vehicle in New Hampshire and -- and there's no claim

This is a mandatory process.

10

made for the vehicle, the law requires that the tow

11

trucker report that fact to the Department of Motor

12

Vehicles.

13

And the Department of Motor Vehicles then

14

looks at the information that's provided and then

15

instructs the tower about the process of whether or not

16

the vehicle can -- can be sold without notice, or if

17

it -- if notice is required, what notice is required.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it's a process that

19

allows you in certain circumstances to sell the car and

20

to take the money.

21

suggesting is -- you know, you have to take the bitter

22

with the sweet.

And what Justice Ginsburg is

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MR. BOUFFARD:

25

Please.

Well, I -- I think

that the -- the New Hampshire law is the New Hampshire

law, and what we have here is -- is a tow trucker that

2

was just making a good faith -- a good faith attempt to

comply with the law.

5

faced with Consumer Protection Act claims and negligence

claims and the kinds of remedies that come with Consumer

impact on the business of these motor carriers.
