ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

We will hear argument

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WOLFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Section 207 of the Social Security Act contains

11

a broad ban on the attachment of Social Security benefits

12

that may be overridden if, in doing so, Congress expressly

13

refers to Section 207.

14

effect of an express reference to Section 207 can go no

15

further than the authority that is granted in the statute

16

that includes the express reference.

17

Debt Collection Act, the statute that contains that

18

express reference, prohibits offsets to collect claims

19

that have been outstanding for more than 10 years.

20

Therefore, the Government lacks offset authority to

21

collect Mr. Lockhart's older debts.

22

Our basic position is that the

Therefore, here, the

The Debt Collections Act's 10-year bar on the

23

right of the Government to offset debt from governmental

24

payments owing to debtors was enacted in 1982.

25

that time, the Government did not have authority to offset

Social Security benefits at all.

2

that there's no 10-year bar here relies entirely on a

3

provision of the Higher Education technical amendments

4

that overrode statutes of limitations for collecting

5

student debts.

6

before the -- before -- the Government had authority to

7

offset Social Security benefits at all.

8

as I've referred to, came only in 1996, in the Debt

9

Collection Improvement Act, which did expressly refer to

The Government's claim

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But

Did -- are -- just as an

13

initial matter, are you sure that one Congress can bind a

14

future Congress that way, that Congress can pass a law

15

that says, you know, "In the future, no statute shall have

16

X effect unless it says" -- and then it writes in a phrase

17

that has to be said?

18

MR. WOLFMAN:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -And then you have a future

20

Congress that makes its intent entirely clear in a statute

21

that does not use the magic words.

22

held that, in such a situation, the will of the future

23

Congress prevails --

MR. WOLFMAN:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. WOLFMAN:

that we've considered.

the issue is not presented here.

5

in -- what occurred in 1996 comported with the express-

reference requirement.

9

bar.

I will say that that is something
It's not briefed here, but I think
And here's why: because

The problem here is that -- so, it
But

So, even if the anti-attachment provision did not

10

exclude the express-reference provision, it still --

11

whatever allowed the attachment has to be, in our view,

12

coincident with the statute in which the express reference

13

--

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

It didn't contain the bar at

15

the time that they said, "You can collect it."

16

later statute, which said, "You now can collect out of

17

Social Security," when they passed that, did it contain a

18

10-year bar?

19

MR. WOLFMAN:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

In the

Yes, it did.
I thought the Higher Education

21

Act said -- as of what year did the Higher Education Act

22

say, "No statute of limitations applies to us"?

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. WOLFMAN:

That was 1991.
Fine.

All right.

Why isn't that the

So --

10

MR. WOLFMAN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason that's --- so there was no -- there was

12

no statute of limitations applying to the Social Security

13

Act; and then, in 1996, they say, "And now go get them."

14

MR. WOLFMAN:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. WOLFMAN:

17

Because -What can we do about that?

Because, with respect, that's not

what Congress said in 1996.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. WOLFMAN:

What did they say?

They didn't say, "Go get them."

20

What they did is, as an amendment to the Debt Collection

21

Act, in the Debt Collection Improvement Act, they inserted

22

permission to go -- to offset Social Security benefits in

23

a statute that has a 10-year bar.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So --

It has a 10-year bar.

But the

earlier 1991 Act says, "That doesn't apply to us."

MR. WOLFMAN:

back -- and I think this takes us back to Justice Scalia's

question -- that -- the -- there is a broad anti-

requirement.

6

requirements can go no -- the abrogation of the -- of the

7

bar to offset Social Security benefits, or to attach

9

than the statute in which that abrogation occurs.

10
11

There is an express-reference

Our view is that the -- that -- those

this statute has a 10-year bar.
So, if I can explain further, the Debt

12

before it, has a 10-year bar.

15

authority to offset after the 10-year period, after the

16

claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years.

17

the statute that includes the abrogation of the offset of

18

Social Security benefits.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not merely a statute

It says that the Government has no

That's

So, in other words, you're

20

saying that that provision of the later statute that says,

21

"Go get them on Social Security," implicitly reads into it

22

the 10-year bar that's in a different part of the statute.

23

MR. WOLFMAN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Well, I -So, it's as if it said, "Go get

them on Social Security, under 407, which is gone now, but

MR. WOLFMAN:

Is that what your -- I'm trying

That is our argument.
Yes.

That is our argument.
Okay.

But I would only qualify it --

JUSTICE BREYER:

The only problem is, it

doesn't say that.
MR. WOLFMAN:

No, I would disagree, Your Honor.

I would say that my only quarrel with your question is

14

that it's not implicit, it is explicit.

15

the Debt Collection Improvement Act, as the Debt

16

Collection Act before it, contains a 10-year bar on the

17

authority of the Government to offset.

18

statute-of-limitations defense that can be waived.

19

is a complete lack of authority to the -- in the

20

Government to offset.

The statute --

This is not a mere
This

That's --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. WOLFMAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are --

-- the statute -Are you saying that this has a

24

purpose other than barring stable -- stale claims?

25

simply designed to limit the offset provisions in order to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

allow other Federal programs to proceed and -- I'm looking

2

for some way for you to describe (e) as being something

3

other than a limitations provision.

4

MR. WOLFMAN:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

Well, what it says -Because I think that would help

you.

7

MR. WOLFMAN:

Yes, and I think -- that's exactly

8

my point.

9

-- and I'm quoting now -- "This Act does not apply when

10

the claim has been outstanding for more than 10 years."

11

That strikes us -- you can call it "limitations" if you

12

want, but it strikes us as a very powerful one.

13

it restricts the Government's ability to bring such a case

14

--

What (e) says is that this Act does not apply

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. WOLFMAN:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because

Well, if --

-- for offset.
-- if we call it

18

"limitations," you have a much harder case, because of the

19

1991 Act.

20

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, I -- with respect, I don't

21

think that the actual nomenclature matters that much, but

22

I will distinguish it from what the law normally calls a

23

limitations period, because a limitations period is one

24

that is raised as an affirmative defense and may be

25

waived.

This provision, where it says, "This Act does not

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

apply" --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

MR. WOLFMAN:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well --

-- does not apply.
-- can you give me a reason

5

for the Government's adopting (e), the 10-year -- the 10-

6

year bar, other than for stale claims or --

7

MR. WOLFMAN:

Oh, I don't know that there is

8

one, but my point, again, is simply that the Government

9

has no authority to proceed.

So, then we look -- we look

10

at that statute, and we say, "What did the -- what did the

11

Congress do in 1996?"

12

amend that very statute by saying, "Within the confines of

13

this statute, you may now offset."

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What the Congress did in 1996 was

All right, but that's -I understand that, but I'm

16

just -- I'm just saying, if you could give me an

17

explanation, a characterization, a description, a

18

statement of purpose that's other than the bar on stale

19

claims, I think you'd have a stronger case.

20

to me just like a stale-claims statute, so I go back and

21

look for other limitations period, and I find it in

22

1091(a).

23

MR. WOLFMAN:

But it seems

You know, again, if -- it is not

24

-- the purposes of the bar are not stated in any of the

25

legislative materials, and we can assume that at least one

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of the principal purposes was to not allow the litigation,

2

the contesting of stale claims, or to give the individuals

3

repose, which is a purpose of time bars.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

You can call it any purpose you

5

want, but there is an earlier word in 9- -- 1091(a), just

6

what Justice Kennedy said.

7

limitations don't apply to the higher-education debt.

8

so, if this later statute, the words you're talking about,

9

the words of "10 years," the words that limit when you can

The earlier word says
And

10

do it, if those words, which are in subsection (e), are a

11

"limitation," then I guess the earlier statute says they

12

don't apply to the higher-education debt.

13

see how you get out of that.

14

rather harsh result.

15

out of it.

16

it.

17

And so, I don't

I mean -- I mean, this is a

I understand why you'd like to get

But I don't understand how we do get out of

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, I think there are -- there

18

are -- I -- there are several answers.

19

first of all, if you must characterize what -- and we are

20

happy to do so -- was in the 1996 Act as either a time

21

bar or a limitations period, this is clearly the former,

22

because this -- because the limitations periods in the law

23

are ones which have to be raised by affirmative defense.

24

For instance, the Rules of Civil Procedure say limitations

25

periods are raised by affirmative defense, and the case

And, if I might,

what this provision does.

4

bring the case.

5

That is not

This provision restricts the

The second thing I would say, though, Your Honor

6

-- and I think it does not matter, ultimately -- that can

7

be our principal submission here, and it is, but it does

8

not matter -- I think, ultimately, the nomenclature

9

doesn't matter, because -- again, because the Act

10

restricts the authority of the Government to bring a case

11

that is beyond the 10-year period.

12

statute that contains the express reference.

13

--

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that is the
That is the

Of course, part of the problem

15

is that 1091(a)(2), the "notwithstanding" clause, talks

16

also specifically about offsets, which is what this is, I

17

take it.

18
19

MR. WOLFMAN:

No, I understand that, Your Honor.

I mean --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

MR. WOLFMAN:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23
24
25

I mean, if it had said "no" --

-- I understand that.
-- "no limitations period,"

then I might -- this specifically talks about an offset.
MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, that's right.

The -- and I

-- I don't think that undercuts our argument at all,

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

because, after all, there's no question that, prior to

2

1996, there was offset authority in the Government to

3

offset -- to collect debt against other types of income,

4

other than Social Security.

5

undercuts our argument at all.

So, I don't think that

6

But let me, if I might, go back to your question

7

one more time, because I think there's yet a third answer,

8

which is -- which is the chronological answer that -- made

9

in our briefs that, in 1991, the Congress could not have

10

had the intent to get at Social Security benefits at all,

11

because, of course, there -- and it's -- this point is

12

conceded -- the Government had no authority whatsoever to

13

offset Social Security benefits.

14

If I might, in the -- let me go --

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I pursue that point for a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- more?

16
17

second -I -- it seems to me

18

that you would have a much stronger argument on that point

19

if, in 1996, the Act provided that, suddenly, Social

20

Security benefits -- some Social Security benefits would

21

be -- would be subject to administrative offset, but only

22

those when the Government -- imposed when the Government

23

is trying to collect educational loans.

24

have what seems to -- would seem to me to be a really

25

head-to-head conflict between the two statutes.

We would then

The

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

trouble is that, in 1996, the extension of the

2

administrative setoff authority covered Social Security

3

benefits to be -- for which there would be a setoff for

4

any purpose -- not just educational loans; for any

5

purpose.

6

the 1996 Act as having an effect -- there's a 10-year

7

limit, generally -- at the same time that we read the

8

earlier -- I forget what the -- '91, I guess it is --

9
10

So that, in fact, it is possible for us to read

MR. WOLFMAN:

The HETA law, yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- which says, with respect to

11

educational loan collections, including by setoff, there's

12

no limitation at all.

13

without rendering either one of them nugatory.

14

that the preferred way to read statutes?

15

MR. WOLFMAN:

So, we can have both statutes
And isn't

Well, but I -- but I -- with all

16

respect, I think our interpretation certainly does not

17

render HETA nugatory, because HETA would still override

18

limitations periods for other forms of collection with

19

respect to other types --

MR. WOLFMAN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Social Security -- Social

a flat head-to-head contradiction, no matter how you read

it, on Social Security setoffs for educational loans.

MR. WOLFMAN:

that the 1996 Act covered, we would say, "Boy, there is

14

that there be no limitation at all.

15

weaker argument than you would have if the 1996 Act only

16

covered this case.

17

We read the 1996 10-year limitation as covering

MR. WOLFMAN:

You just have a

Well, that may be, but let me,

18

again, if I -- if I might, respond to that -- to this --

19

to this point, because I think it is true that the

20

proportion of times under our argument that the 10-year

21

bar would apply would -- is greater under our position,

22

but it is, nevertheless, true that HETA still applies to

23

many situations, under our reading, and the 10-year bar

24

applies to somewhat more.

25

another answer to your point, which is, it still does not

undercut our basic submission that the Congress could not

have formed this specific intent.

the -- the intent being to get to the Government the --

4

the result it seeks here.

5

is, they could not have focused on this problem, because

6

in -- it wasn't for another 5 years that Social Security

7

was even on the radar screen at all.

8

back, I think, to Justice Breyer's --

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

MR. WOLFMAN:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And it's very unlike

And the reason for that is --

And this brings me

Yes, but --

-- initial question.
-- may I ask this question?

12

That's a very -- that's a very interesting statutory

13

construction case, I must say, by the way.

14

1996, when they made the offset available against Social

15

Security payments, they didn't enact a 10-year statute of

16

limitations; they changed subsection, I think, (b) to (d)

17

and said the 10-year provision is retained.

18

10-year provision was first put in -- I mean, when the

19

exception for student loans was made, in 1991, you had a

20

statute that had a 10-year period for everything except

21

student loan recovery.

22

look at the 1996 statute as saying, "We're going to allow

23

offsets against Social Security," under the same scheme

24

that was enacted in 1991, because we had just amended the

25

10-year provision to preserve it -- they preserved the 10-

But the -- in

And when the

And it seems to me that if you

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

year provision -- that they seem to me to be preserving it

2

in a statute that made this distinction between student

3

loans and all other offsets.

4

MR. WOLFMAN:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is --

I -It isn't as though they

6

enacted, for the first time, an authority to offset Social

7

Security and, in that statute, said, "And -- but, by the

8

way, there's a 10-year period of limitations here."

9

MR. WOLFMAN:

10
11

Well, that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Rather, they amended the 1991

Act.

12

MR. WOLFMAN:

-- that is correct.

And I think

13

that -- but with a caveat, which I'll get to -- but -- I

14

think that is correct, but it is a -- it is a consequence

15

of the situation that Congress found itself in, in 1996.

16

In other words, it already had a statute, the offset

17

statute, which had a 10-year bar.

18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:
for student loans.

But it also had the exception

It's -- it was --

of the 10-year bar.

I'm not sure what you mean in that

-- I'm not sure what you mean by the exception for student

loans.

MR. WOLFMAN:

statutory provision, in a different part of the code.

yes, what I'm saying is, they --

MR. WOLFMAN:

Right.

It was in a 1991 statute

8

that was a freestanding statute that dealt with Social

Security benefits, generally.

Then what you had in 1996

10

was a focus on offsets, specifically, and on Social

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that there is a

reasonable basis for assuming Congress might have thought

9

that student loans should not have a 10-year bar if you're

10

going to collect from Social Security, because most Social

11

Security payments won't accrue until many, many years --

12

much more than 10 years after the student-loan default.

MR. WOLFMAN:

I do want to get to one other point
before I sit down, and -- which is to address one of the

10

Government's arguments -- is that to -- to get around a --

11

the problem that the DCIA reenacted the 10-year bar, the

12

Government relies on the "notwithstanding" clause of the

13

1991 Education Act, arguing that it wipes away any time

14

bar, regardless of when the time bar was enacted, and no

15

matter what type of collection is at issue.

16

note in our reply brief extensively, those

17

"notwithstanding" clauses are not as all-powerful as the

18

Government suggests they are.

19

the lower-court case law suggests is that you need to

look, as we have done in our submission, at the

legislative history and the legislative motive surrounding

Thank you, Mr. Wolfman.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In sweeping and unqualified language, the Higher

8

Education Act provides that, notwithstanding any other

9

provision of law, no limitations as to time shall apply to

10

the collection of student-loan debt by offset.

11

notwithstanding the general 10-year limit that applies to

12

the offset of all Federal payments, including Social

13

Security payments, no time limit applies.

Either one.

In 1982, Federal payments

20

were subject to offsets such as Federal grants or

21

contracts or pension.

22

that said there's no -- going to be no time limit for the

23

Government to collect student-loan debt by offset.

24

Therefore, there has always been a student-loan exception

25

to the Government's ability to offset for only up to 10

MS. BLATT:

12

says, notwithstanding any other provision of law, there's

13

no time limit for offsetting -- for collection by offset

14

when it's to collect student-loan debt.

15

1996 is, Congress authorized Social Security benefits as

16

another source of Federal payment.

intact that pre-existing 10-year limit and the pre-

any other provision of existing law."

7

It doesn't say "notwithstanding
It says "any law."

And it would be a rather bizarre and novel statute if

8

Congress had to keep amending every time Congress

9

redesignated a limitation provision, which is all that's

10

happened here.

11

provision that changed from subsection (e) to (a), or was

12

given a different section number, Congress would have to

13

go back and say -- I guess, reenact the Higher Education

14

Act every time it amended the statute of limitations.

15

But, even if you think that it only applied to pre-

16

existing limitations period, this 10-year limit predated

17

the Higher Education Act.

18

-- and has appeared in identical language since 1983.

19

Nothing happened in 1996 to statutes of limitations.

20

that happened was that Congress, in essence, put Social

21

Security benefits on par, equal footing, with all other

22

Federal payments.

23

Every time Congress had a limitation

It was passed in 1982, and had

Ninety percent of all student-loan

debtors who default do so before age 55.

reaches full retirement age, at age 65.

10

it's relevant for what Congress was thinking in 1996.

11

1996, Congress made Social Security benefits subject to

13

Congress of course understood there would be a general 10-

14

year limit that's always been applied to offsets of all

15

Federal payments, including the Federal contract payments
