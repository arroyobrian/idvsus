We'll hear argument

Mr. Bress.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BRESS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The problem at the heart of this case is

11

construing subsections (d) and (e) of 28 U.S.C. 2254

12

together in a way that makes sense.

13

this Court construed those two provisions together was

14

in Michael Williams.

15

different issue.

16

The last time that

Michael Williams presented a

But we believe that looking at how Michael

17

Williams would play out with a small change in the facts

18

will help frame the issue that's before the court today.

19

Now, as the Court recalls, in Michael

20

Williams the Virginia Supreme Court denied Williams the

21

investigative assistance he needed in order to help

22

develop a claim based on his suspicions of jury

23

misconduct.

24

State court.

25

He, therefore, didn't make the claim in

On -- in Federal court he got investigative

assistance; and, in speaking with the investigator, two

2

of the jurors referred to the foreperson, Bonnie

3

Stinette, as Bonnie Minehart.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Bress, before we get

5

into that, could I just ask you a threshold question?

6

We took this case to decide a question, and one of the

7

factual predicates of the question is that the State

8

court refused to consider certain evidence.

9

puzzled about that.

And I'm

10

What was the evidence that the State court

11

-- do you say that the State court refused to consider

12

evidence that was proffered to it?

13

MR. BRESS:

No, Your Honor.

The State court

14

did not refuse to consider evidence proffered to it.

15

The State court refused to permit the full development

16

of the evidence.

17

--

18
19
20

And it -- I mean it misled the court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I didn't hear the -- the

last part.
MR. BRESS:

The State court refused to

21

permit the evidence to be fully developed, Your Honor.

22

They didn't refuse to consider evidence.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you mean by that?

What specifically did they MR. BRESS:

Specifically, Your Honor, the
4

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State provided 120 days to develop the State habeas

2

petition.

3

different claims, including the claim that's at issue

4

here today.

5

The Petitioners during that time developed 14

In the course of that they interviewed, I

6

think, 11 different witnesses.

7

assistance-of-counsel claim they got affidavits.

8

also interviewed all 12 jurors for five different claims

9

of juror misconduct.

10
11

For the ineffective
They

They interviewed five different

witnesses for Brady claims, et cetera.
They ran out of time, Your Honor, and they

12

asked the court for more time on repeated occasions.

13

They asked the court to investigate -

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15
16

But that really does not

present the question that you asked the Court to decide.
MR. BRESS:

Well, Your Honor, if you read it

17

that way, it would not, but I don't read the question

18

presented that way.

19

present the question of when the district court properly

20

hears evidence after a finding of diligence by the

21

prisoner and holds that the State court didn't provide a

22

full and fair opportunity to that prisoner to develop

23

the facts in State court, that where the evidence is

24

important the -- the district court may consider that

25

evidence, rather than giving deference to the State

I read the question presented to

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court.

2

And giving deference to the State court is

3

not even on the table any longer in this case.

4

-- what the Fourth Circuit did, the Fourth Circuit took

5

the new evidence into account and deferred to the State

6

court nonetheless.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was

Why wouldn't he have

8

brought that new evidence to the attention of the State

9

court first?

10

attention of the State court?

11
12

MR. BRESS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, he could have a

post-conviction proceeding in the State court.

15
16

He didn't have the new evidence,

Your Honor.

13
14

Why wasn't he obliged to bring it to the

MR. BRESS:

Actually, no, he couldn't, Your

Honor.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. BRESS:

A State habeas.

I'm sorry.

The -- as the

19

Virginia Commonwealth attorneys point out in their

20

amicus brief, there is a rule in the Virginia State

21

court that any facts not set out in the habeas petition

22

at the State level can't be brought in later.

23

able to bring the facts in afterwards.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He wasn't

Well, weren't the

facts merely cumulative evidence of his claim that was
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

before the State court?

2

MR. BRESS:

No, they weren't, Your Honor.

3

There were three categories of new facts or new evidence

4

that came in on Federal habeas.

5

And if I may, the first -- the first of them

6

had to do with facts that undermined the State's claim

7

of aggravation.

8

aggravating factor.

9

in the course of that, in developing it, their number

The State relied on only one
That was future dangerousness.

And

10

one emphasis was on one adjudicated -- unadjudicated bad

11

act, and this was a story told by Billy Jo Swartz about

12

an alleged horrific assault on her and of Tracy

13

Nicholson, who was a girlfriend of the Petitioner.

14

What the jury didn't know at the time was

15

that both Tracy and her mother, who were there, said

16

that the incident did not occur, that there was no

17

assault there, and Billy Jo Swartz was a liar.

18

Now, on State habeas, Joanne did submit an

19

affidavit and, in that affidavit, said that Billy Jo

20

Swartz had lied.

21

State level, but unfortunately rather than hear the

22

witnesses to determine the credibility and -- the

23

Virginia Supreme Court instead decided against

24

Petitioner.

25

That created a dispute of fact at the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, I think that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

supports my suggestion, which is that the evidence was

2

cumulative.

3

was evidence on both sides.

4

got more evidence.

5

There was a dispute on that issue.

MR. BRESS:

There

And now you say, hey, we've

Well, it's not more evidence,

6

Your Honor; it's just that a dispute over the facts

7

where credibility is at issue shouldn't be decided on

8

the papers.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the Virginia Supreme

10

Court, on habeas, said we are going to accept as true

11

all the facts as the Petitioner alleged them.

12

specifically "all facts alleged in the petition will be

13

taken as true."

14
15

MR. BRESS:

They said

And if they had done that, Your

Honor, I think that we'd be in a different position.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. BRESS:

They said they did.

They said, on the one hand, they

18

did, and yet, on the other hand, when they were looking,

19

for example, at Joanne Nicholson's testimony, they said

20

she could have been effectively impeached by other

21

statements that she had made, that in their household,

22

she had never seen Bell be physically abusive to her

23

daughter.

24

have said throughout that he was never physically

25

abusive to Tracy.

Now, Joanne Nicholson and Tracy Nicholson

The supposed impeachment would have
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

come from police court records that have never been

2

introduced in this case.

3

without a hearing, just said, on the one hand, we accept

4

these facts as true and, on the other hand, even though

5

Joanne Nicholson would testify that this event never

6

occurred that way, she would have been impeached so the

7

jury wouldn't have believed it.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the Virginia Supreme Court,

Well, your argument is

dependent on the proposition that the claim that was

10

advanced in the Federal habeas proceeding is a different

11

claim from a claim that was adjudicated on the merits in

12

the State court?

13

MR. BRESS:

That's right, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if that's the case, I

15

don't understand why your adversary is not correct that

16

it will always be possible in capital cases for an

17

ineffective assistance of counsel claim that has been

18

adjudicated on the merits in the State court to be

19

advanced and get de novo review in Federal habeas, where

20

every aspect of the defendant's life that is potentially

21

favorable can be advanced as a basis for mitigation.

22

You know, when your firm with all of its expertise and

23

resources comes into the case at the Federal habeas

24

level, will it not always be the case that you will be

25

able to find some additional mitigation evidence and
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

then, under your theory, that will be a new claim and it

2

well get de novo review?

3

MR. BRESS:

I'd like to answer that

4

question, Justice Alito, in two ways:

5

practical, which is that the Ninth and Tenth Circuits

6

have adopted the rule that we advocated for years.

7

Sixth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have adopted that

8

rule for Brady claims, and we haven't seen the flood

9

that supposedly is going to come through the gates.

10

One very

Secondly, on a more theoretical level, for

11

someone to be able to introduce this new evidence on

12

Federal habeas, they have to first be able to

13

demonstrate that they were diligent in attempting

14

formulate it in the State court.

15

be able to demonstrate that it's important and

16

importantly changes the overall factual mix.

17

The

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Second, they've got to

Now -

I don't get the diligence

18

part because the whole ineffective assistance of counsel

19

is the client isn't expected to do any of this; it's

20

counsel that's been ineffective.

21

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, I'm referring to

22

Michael Williams, which talks about diligence by the

23

State habeas counsel.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, it doesn't translate

into ineffective assistance of counsel because the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

client is not the one -- the lawyer has been -- has not

2

been diligent, but there is nothing that the client

3

could do.

I just don't see how -

4

MR. BRESS:

Well -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- how you could talk

6

about the diligent -- the diligent client bringing up

7

the ineffectiveness of his lawyer.

8

MR. BRESS:

9

Your Honor, we understand and

appreciate the diligence of habeas counsel is not any

10

kind of excuse and can't be -- statutorily it can't be,

11

actually under 2554, but what we are talking about is

12

whether the prisoner and his counsel were diligent in

13

seeking to develop the facts for their claim when they

14

were on State habeas.

15

to do with it.

16

reasonable efforts and said that the contrary would be

17

negligence.

18

That's what Michael Williams had

Michael Williams equated diligence with

In this case we've got a finding by the

19

district court that Bell and his lawyers were diligent

20

in seeking to develop their ineffective assistance of

21

counsel claim at State habeas.

22

them under (e), that's what says that they didn't fail

23

to develop the evidence under (e)(2) and allows them to

24

go through the gate of (e).

25

And that's what allows

Now, in order to get here, you have to
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

demonstrate that diligence.

2

demonstrate that you're able to develop new facts that

3

matter, that are important, that are significant.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You also have to

But you use the -- to say

5

that it's a new claim, because that's what it has to be,

6

right, but it's such an extraordinary use of "claim."

7

mean, we have exhibit cases, the notion is a claim, is a

8

tort claim or a contract claim, but not additional

9

evidence in support of the basic claim.

10
11

I

The basic claim

is ineffective assistance of counsel.
MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, I appreciate that

12

it's not "claim" as it's used ordinarily in the Rules of

13

Civil Procedure or when you're talking about making

14

claims in that sort of a complaint.

15

Court, including an opinion -- Banks v. Dretke, for

16

example, talked about the two different Brady claims in

17

that case as separate claims, even though they were

18

withholdings by the same prosecutor.

19

in Michael Williams, there were two separate

20

withholdings of evidence to impeach the same witness.

21
22

JUSTICE BREYER:

More closely even,

All right.

So I'm trying

to figure out how the statute works.

23

MR. BRESS:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

However, this

Yes.
And it seems to me that the

way it's supposed to work -- have you read, by the way,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the facts of the case for December in Bell v. Cohen?

2

No?

3

because it's similar to the hypothetical I'm thinking

4

of.

Okay.

5

Forget that.

I was going to shorthand that

What happens is that the -- the State court

6

now says, okay, I assume all the facts in your favor and

7

you don't prevail.

8

Federal court and he has some new facts.

9

they are such that they transform the claim and it's a

All right.

Now, he goes into
Now, either

10

new claim.

11

for that, maybe not in yours, or they aren't.

12

they aren't, then what he is supposed to do, the judge,

13

is go look and decide on the basis of what they

14

presented to the State.

15

I mean, in that case there is an argument
Now, if

That's the end of it.

Now, if they are, he is supposed to exhaust.

16

You go back, you exhaust this new claim like any other

17

new claim, and if the State bars it, then you go and see

18

if there was cause and prejudice.

19

supposed to work.

20

then you have the hearing.

21

supposed to work factually.

22

And that's how it's

And if there was cause and prejudice,
Okay?

That's how it's

I have no idea if that's what went on here,

23

but if it -- it didn't seem to me -- there was some

24

confusion about whether the procedures are adequate in

25

the State.

Then there is some other thing that this
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

might be the same claim.

2

to the question we took this case to decide, frankly,

3

without knowing what the basis was and whether it was

4

correct for the district court to give him any hearing

5

at all.

6

MR. BRESS:

I mean, I don't see how we get

Okay, Your Honor.

I'd like to

7

address that.

I think that that's essentially how this

8

works in this case.

9

district court did here is it first made a finding of

What the district -- what the

10

was there diligence?

11

Michael Williams to even take the next step.

12

Petitioner -

13

Because it has to do that under

JUSTICE BREYER:

Did the

That's the first step.

14

first step, I'd go and see -- but at any rate, you go

15

ahead.

16

MR. BRESS:

Right.

The

But it had to take that

17

step.

And it had to take that step, by the way, of

18

course, with (d) in mind as well, because this Court in

19

Schriro said there is no reason to have hearing if it is

20

separately precluded by another predicate.

21

obviously, it was the refusal to -- to allow mitigating

22

evidence.

23

separately under Townsend, was there a problem in State

24

court that -- did you have a full and fair hearing, and

25

if you can prove the facts that you state, would you

So it does that.

In Schriro,

Then it determines

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

win, and so those allowed the court the discretion to

2

hold a hearing.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why wouldn't you say

4

right off the bat, new claim, go present it to the State

5

court, and exhausts it?

6
7

MR. BRESS:

Well this couldn't have been

presented in the State court.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. BRESS:

10
11

Why not?

Well as the State argued below,

it would have been procedurally deficient.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

Suppose we

12

have -- that's what I want, not these facts, but I want

13

the facts where really, he couldn't have discovered

14

this, because the first time that the district attorney

15

opened his files for the Brady claim was 140 days after.

16

So we now have some totally new, which he couldn't have

17

gotten; no one disputes it.

18

thing -- I think he would have to present it to the

19

State court, wouldn't he?

20

MR. BRESS:

Where, that kind of

Well, Your Honor, according to

21

the warden at least, in this case if you took let's say

22

the facts of Banks v Dretke, which this Court decided,

23

where when you were in front of the State court, what

24

you knew was that the girlfriend of the prisoner had

25

said that one of the witnesses was particularly close to
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

law enforcement, and on that basis they made a claim, a

2

Brady claim in State court.

3

wasn't factually developed enough, all right?

4

It was denied because it

So they went to Federal court and in Federal

5

court they got a lot more evidence that supported that

6

claim.

7

was a Government informant, and on that basis this Court

8

found cause and prejudice and addressed that that

9

claim -

10

They actually found out that in fact this person

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you must have been

11

assuming then that the State would not give that person

12

a -- a new opportunity to consider the new evidence.

13

MR. BRESS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. BRESS:

16
17

Well, that's absolutely true Suppose it were really new.

The State statute is

unequivocal.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but so is it in

18

Tennessee, and in Tennessee there is an exception where

19

you could bring the thing up because you couldn't

20

possibly have gotten over it.

21

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, there is no

22

exception here in Virginia.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in Virginia a person

24

discovers for the first time, 140 days later looks at

25

the D.A.'s files, and discovers something that shows the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whole trial was a farce -- I mean, something

2

unbelievable, and there is no way for the person under

3

Virginia law to bring that up in a State court?

4
5

MR. BRESS:

Not in this sort of a claim.

No, Your Honor, there isn't.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Bress, your -

7

you're argument that this can't be brought up assumes

8

that it is a new claim rather than the same claim,

9

right?

Because if it were just the same claim then the

10

question would be it is simply cumulative rather than

11

new?

12

MR. BRESS:

If it's the same claim for

13

2254(d) purposes, yes, Your Honor.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And I guess

15

it gets back to Justice Ginsburg's question.

We usually

16

don't consider claims different if there is just new

17

evidence, but here didn't the Fourth Circuit necessarily

18

determine that this was the same claim in deciding to

19

defer to the State court findings?

20

MR. BRESS:

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

The

21

Fourth Circuit viewed this as the same claim and that's

22

the root of some of our disagreement with them.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if fact you got

24

more than you were entitled to, because it did look at

25

the new evidence, albeit through the guise of deference,
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

but it shouldn't have even looked at that at all.

2

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor.

We would agree that

3

that -- that interim solution is not a plausible

4

solution, so we would agree with that, on the new

5

evidence -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if we think that

7

they were right -- and we are, I think we are getting

8

away from the question presented -- if we agree that

9

they are right, that this is the same claim and it's

10

just additional evidence, then you lose.

11

MR. BRESS:

No, not necessarily, Your Honor.

12

We also argued on separate grounds where the State's

13

procedure is inadequate, then the -- the State's

14

application of -- of Federal law would have been

15

unreasonable.

16
17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Bress, may I ask you a

question -

18

MR. BRESS:

And if that's true -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you a question

20

which sort of goes to the utility of raising that issue

21

here, and it's a preliminary, not a doctrinal question.

22

But -

23

MR. BRESS:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

Sure.
-- my understanding is that

in the United States District Court on the Federal habe
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- the district court made a -- drew a conclusion based

2

on the evidence before it, no deference to the State

3

court, that in fact your client did not demonstrate

4

prejudice.

5

although the Fourth Circuit did not rely upon that, my

6

understanding is that that -- that finding remains

7

undisturbed.

8

And my understanding is that that -

Is that correct?

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, what the district

9

court found, as the Fourth Circuit saw it and as we see

10

it, was that the State court's finding of prejudice was

11

not unreasonable.

12

the district court's oral ruling you won't see a

13

reference to 2254(d).

Now, I acknowledge that when you read

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. BRESS:

No.

However, when you look at what

16

the State court wrote in its written ruling, what it

17

says is there is a colorable claim that the State court

18

was unreasonable, on -- in application of law to the

19

facts and development of the facts, and then it said

20

that they will -- that the court would not decide this

21

issue yet, until it has a hearing; and so the Fourth

22

Circuit looked at what the district court wrote and

23

presumed that consistent with what it had written, it

24

then confronted this issue, the issue of reasonability,

25

orally; and it didn't require that when a judge is
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

saying something orally, as opposed to putting it in a

2

written opinion, that it dot every i and cross every t.

3

It assumed that it meant what it had said earlier.

4

this Court has any doubt about that, however, it could

5

certainly remand with instructions.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If

I that what it was saying

7

is there is legitimate -- this is a Strickland question.

8

Strickland has two parts.

9

inadequate; and Part B is did it make any difference?

Part A is were counsel

10

It seemed to me the district court was just making a

11

straight out Strickland determination and not deferring

12

to anything else.

13

all the evidence, and yes -- they certainly were -- they

14

were not effective.

15

prejudice because using the strict Strickland test,

16

there was no reasonable likelihood that a jury would

17

have come out differently.

18

Your Honor, consistent with the

Fourth Circuit, we don't read him to say that.

20

if he meant that, the Fourth Circuit certainly on -

21

looked at this from a reasonableness standpoint, and not

22

from a de novo standpoint.

didn't get the correct standard or review on appeal.

MR. BRESS:

Don't you think it's important

If I may return to the Chief

16

Judge's -- Chief Justice's question from earlier, there

17

are other new claims, new facts here that are equally

important in deciding whether this is a new claim.

19

20

and really was first discovered -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

For

I know, but they're

22

-- your underlying theory is that if you get a lot of

23

new evidence, that somehow changes the claim.

24

again, I think Justice Ginsburg -- I'm having trouble

25

getting my arms around that, and particularly since it's

And

problematic in this area where there is always new

2

evidence.

3

You're looking at someone's childhood.

You

4

can always find a new anecdote, a new concern going

5

either way, that you know, this was unusual because he

6

was a good child, or this is excused because he had such

7

a bad upbringing.

8
9

MR. BRESS:
to this.

Mr. Chief Justice, two responses

Number one -- and you know, as I've said

10

before, this Court has used claim I think in similar

11

ways.

12

demonstrates that it can use it.

It may have been colloquial but it at least

13

I'm not saying it's the most normal, or the

14

ordinary course definition, but I am saying that it's

15

the definition that's necessary to read (d) and (e)

16

together in a way that makes sense; and if I can just

17

explain why I think that's true.

18

If you look at (e), (e) says that you can

19

get a hearing even if you weren't diligent in State

20

court, if the facts that you need to develop were not

21

reasonably available in State court and if they would

22

prove by clear and convincing evidence that you are

23

innocent.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All right, well

just -- we've got two but just to stop you on one.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fact that they excuse your failure to raise and present

2

the evidence in State court doesn't mean that when you

3

get the evidence you have a new claim.

4

that they are going to let you raise a claim you could

5

have raised before.

6

MR. BRESS:

It just means

Well, if what they are talking

7

about is -- if that includes the ability when you are in

8

State court -- assume, for instance, House versus Bell,

9

just if can take that as an example.

10

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. BRESS:

I've gotten over it.

I don't know, but if we can -

13

if we can just look at the facts of that case briefly:

14

Assume that in State court, despite diligent a effort,

15

they were able to come up with some of the evidence but

16

not all of the evidence that they later came up with in

17

terms of the blood spattering, the DNA, and such.

18

Their claim is denied on the -- on the

19

merits because they weren't able to get much of the

20

evidence in and denied in State courts.

21

go to Federal courts where they were able to bring in

22

all of that evidence, and let's say even more, enough to

23

prove by clear and convincing evidence that they were

24

innocent.

25

They couldn't

Under the warden's view, you'd still go back
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the State court opinion and decide whether it was

2

intrinsically reasonable.

3

wouldn't -- the State court gets affirmed, and none of

4

that new evidence of innocence comes in.

5

Now, I guess it's a possible solution, but

6

the question is:

7

here?

8
9

And so long as it is, you

Is that what Congress really intended

JUSTICE BREYER:
-- okay, so it's a new claim.

I might say the new claim
I don't know if yours is,

10

by the way, but suppose it's a new claim.

11

ought to do is go back to the State court and exhaust.

12

So now what you show is that that's futile.

13

Now we get to your question before us.

14

Okay.

15

in December than here.

16

get back to the State court.

17

18

So it's an imaginary case.

It's less imaginary

But, anyway, the -- the -- you

At that point I guess the statute leaves the

19

judge free to develop the facts.

20

can't.

21

Then what you

Okay.

It doesn't say you

So then you do it.

Now we have the question, which when we took

22

this we thought we could reach, but I don't know if we

23

can -- now we have the question:

24

the decision on the basis of those facts, if they have

25

never developed any of this in State court, fine.

When the judge makes

Alderson Reporting Company

Then

have -- then just do it.

2

defer it.

3

If it is a regular case, don't

But suppose some of the things have been in

4

State court related to this but not others.

5

we do?

6

MR. BRESS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

obvious answer to that one.

9

MR. BRESS:

Now what do

Well, Your Honor I mean that's not an

I -- I think that in -- in that

10

case, by the way, you still have to defer to the State

11

factfinding.

12

determines particular facts.

13

I think you always have to when the State

JUSTICE BREYER:

What it's going to do is

14

it's going to be finding facts on the basis of certain

15

evidence.

16

granted on is the fact that you found some new evidence

17

that's very significant, and you couldn't possibly have

18

found it before.

19
20
21

And what you will have gotten your new claim

Now what do we do?

Do we defer in part; do

we defer -- I mean now what does the district judge do?
MR. BRESS:

Well, I think that, again, you

22

have to defer under (e)(1) presumably to particular fact

23

findings and find that by clear and convincing evidence

24

you've disproved those facts.

25

think you could find the application of law to fact.

But, otherwise, I don't

25
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't think you can under Holland, et cetera.

2

Now, you know, just to make this a little

3

bit clearer, hopefully, in -- in Keeney, upon which this

4

Court drew in Michael Williams, the Court looked -- the

5

Court did -- looked at a potential distinction between

6

the failure properly to make a claim in State court and

7

the failure properly to develop the facts for that

8

claim.

9

Now, the Court looked at that distinction in

10

the context of seeing whether cause and prejudice, which

11

applied to certainly the major claim in the State court,

12

should apply to the failure to fully develop it.

13

what it said is that distinguishing between those two

14

circumstances is irrational.

15

And

Now, I would submit that it's similarly

16

irrational to attribute to Congress the intent to

17

distinguish between the circumstances, or because of

18

these limitations you have in State court, despite your

19

effort, you weren't able to fully develop the record.

20

And the State decided the case on an

21

inadequate record.

It comes to Federal court.

Do you

22

simply defer?

23

the State court reasonably decided this case based on an

24

inadequate State court record, or do you allow that

25

record to be fully developed and decide it on its

I mean do you simply stop when you say

26

merits?

2
3

That's, I think, the issue that we are
presenting today.

4

I'd like to reserve -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I just ask one quick

5

question?

6

what you just said, the answer to the -- the need

7

to-exhaust point is you don't have to exhaust because

8

you already tried to exhaust in the State court, and

9

they didn't give you enough time to get your evidence

10

in.

That is -

11
12

MR. BRESS:

That's precisely it, Your Honor.

Thank you.

The -- the answer, I take it, on -- based on

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Bress.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE BURNETT

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. BURNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The claim in Bell's case is the textbook

21

example of a claim that the effective death penalty

22

intended for 2254(d) to apply to.

23

Supreme Court, Bell presented his claim with his

24

allegations of what he says counsel didn't present and

25

didn't find at trial.

In the Virginia

And the Virginia Supreme Court
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

assumed the truth of all of those allegations and did

2

not contest any of them.

3

dispute.

4

There were never any facts in

The State never contested any facts.
The State court assumed them all true, and

5

then applied -- faithfully applied this Court's

6

established precedent under Strickland and Wiggins, in

7

particular, and weighed that evidence that he had

8

claimed had not been found by his counsel against the

9

aggravating evidence in this case of a drug dealer who

10

killed premeditatedly a police officer in a small town

11

and upon weighing that found as a -- as a matter -- as a

12

de novo matter on the merits that he could not show

13

prejudice.

14

that a jury would have found a life sentence giving -

15

assuming the truth of everything he alleged.

16

Because there was no reasonable probability

Now, when he went to Federal court, the

17

Fourth Circuit faithfully applied 2254(d) to that after

18

addressing all of the same evidence and also agreeing

19

that there was no prejudice, and then said that the

20

State court decision was not unreasonable under 2254(d).

21

Now, Bell comes to this Court and says for

22

the first time that I have a new claim, and that was not

23

made below, and this is not a new claim.

24

that he presented in Federal court was presented to the

25

State court.

Everything

There is absolutely no difference.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fact, to the effect that there was some difference in

2

the district court and the State alleged -- we pleaded

3

default because he presented a few new affidavits.

4

The district court resolved that and said:

5

I'm not even going to look at those because they aren't

6

critical to my decision.

7

and he described in particular the exact same record

8

that the Virginia Supreme Court had found.

9

district court -

10

I am only going to look at -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then the

Well, what about the

11

point that Mr. Bress made that there wasn't enough time

12

in the Virginia Supreme Court on habeas to develop

13

everything that was later put before the district court;

14

that there was a very short time to get the petition in,

15

and there were many issues other than ineffective

16

assistance of counsel?

17

MS. BURNETT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, there

18

were approximately 12 issues in this case that the

19

district court disposed of in a very lengthy opinion.

20

It was only this one issue that the district court found

21

-- believed that he needed to have a hearing on, we

22

believe erroneously.

23

hearing and -- and listened to all the same evidence.

24
25

But, nevertheless, he had the

Nothing, Justice Ginsburg -- in our opinion
nothing prevented Bell from presenting the allegations
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that were presented to the Federal court and all the

2

allegations that he presented to the State court.

3

was no State court procedure or denial of anything.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Did he make any request

5

from the State court for more time?

6

MS. BURNETT:

7

Your Honor, I don't -- I don't

--

8
9

There

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Your brother is nodding

yes.

10

MS. BURNETT:

He may very well have, but the

11

point is that there was nothing that he presented to the

12

Federal court that he didn't also present to the State

13

court.

14

red herring in this case.

So he was not prevented from -- that -- that's a

15

Now, he had some very strong arguments that

16

he made in both the State court and in the district

17

court on other claims; not on this claim but on other

18

claims, that he believed that he should have been able

19

to develop certain evidence.

20

actually on those other claims -- some of them, it found

21

faulted and some not.

22

claim -

23

And the district court

But not on this claim.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

On this

If we had -- if we had -

24

and I -- I emphasize I'm -- I'm not suggesting this is

25

your case.

But if we had a case in which with respect
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the disputed issue he had asked for more time -- I'll

2

make it easy.

3

-- had indicated that there were leads that needed to be

4

followed that couldn't be followed unless he got more

5

time and so on, and the State court refused.

6

then come into the Federal court and say:

7

is not only ineffective assistance, but ineffective

8

assistance with the overlay of the refusal of the State

9

courts to give me an adequate opportunity to develop my

He had asked for more time and -- and had

Could he

My claim here

10

-- my ineffective assistance claim?

11

colorable showing on those two issues, would he then

12

have an opportunity for a Federal evidentiary issue, and

13

would the findings that eventuated from that be subject

14

to -- in effect, to -- to being short- circuited by

15

deference to the State court findings?

16

MS. BURNETT:

And if he made a

I think my answer to that has

17

to be that it depends because the statute before the

18

effective Death Penalty Act in 1996 had clearly had what

19

we would call the Chandler v. Dane factors in which

20

would you look at the adequacy of a State court process.

21

Those were removed after 1996, so the statute does not

22

provide authority for a Federal court to go in and

23

determine was the process adequate if the decision,

24

itself, was reasonable.

25

is why this case -

Now if we are talking -- this

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if you don't -- I guess

2

what I'm getting at is if we don't in that circumstance

3

recognize that there is a legitimately different claim

4

which is not, for the reason I suggested to Mr. Bress,

5

not subject to further exhaustion requirements because

6

they tried and the State court wouldn't let them do

7

it -- if we don't in that case recognize that there is a

8

claim that can be litigated in the Federal court, which

9

will not be subject to deference to State court

10

findings, then there is a very clear hole in the law,

11

and I assume Congress didn't mean to leave it.

12

understand you're saying that is not this case.

13

isn't that a legitimate problem to-- to face at some

14

point.

15

MS. BURNETT:

I
But

Justice Souter, we don't

16

believe so and here's why:

17

did not change the procedural default doctrine.

18

Effective Death Penalty Act Congress left that alone.

19

In fact, this Court recognized that in House v. Bell.

20

So when we are talking about new facts or new claims,

21

either one, you're talking about unexhausted or

22

defaulted matters, which the district courts are very

23

familiar how to handle that.

24

prejudice?

25

Because it is true, Congress
In the

Has he shown cause and

Has he shown diligence?
JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think you're right in the

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

main.

2

I'm concerned with is the case of the -- of the Brady

3

claim, because if we are proceeding under (e) then as I

4

understand the cause and prejudice can only be

5

established in the case we are talking about if there

6

can be shown a probability of a different verdict.

7

I think that's generally correct.

The case that

The Brady standard, however, does not

8

require the probability of a different verdict.

Brady

9

uses the term "reasonable probability that there would

10

have been a different result," but that has been clearly

11

defined in the cases to mean reasonable possibility.

12

that in fact with respect to Brady claims subsection (e)

13

is imposing a higher requirement than Brady did and a

14

higher requirement than would have been applied before

15

Brady.

16

it may not be this case, but that's the case that we've

17

got to be concerned about in coming up with doctrine

18

here.

19

So

And that is the case, it seems to me, that we -

Isn't that a legitimate concern?
MS. BURNETT:

Justice Souter -- and I agree

20

that's not this case.

But this Court's already crossed

21

that bridge.

22

Williams was where the individual comes to Federal court

23

with brand new evidence and he has no remedy left in

24

State court.

25

that?

That was Michael Williams.

Michael

It is defaulted, and what do we do with

And this Court very clearly -- now, as the issue
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was presented to this Court in that case it was whether

2

he gets a hearing or not, so that's what was addressed.

3

But this Court also addressed the fact that it most

4

likely was and was a defaulted claim and that it -

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I don't, I don't think

6

this Court understood the implication of it when you get

7

into the Brady issue.

8

to leave that door open because I don't think Williams

9

confronted that.

10

And my only concern is we've got

MS. BURNETT:

And I -- I agree with Your

11

Honor that it's not this case.

I think Michael Williams

12

addresses it and I think that the current existing in

13

place cause and prejudice and actual innocence

14

exceptions to default answer all of that.

15

that -

And I believe

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I understand your position.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm still trying to

18

understand the statute.

I think their point is we get

19

around (d), (d) doesn't bar us because the district

20

court here, the Federal district court, found that it

21

was an unreasonable determination of the facts, not

22

unreasonable on the substance, but unreasonable because

23

of the procedure.

24

this evidence was having an unreasonable procedure and

25

therefore the determination of the facts is

In other words, the State that barred

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unreasonable.

So you're saying that isn't what those

2

words "unreasonable determination of the facts" mean.

3

MS. BURNETT:

Well, what I'm saying -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

You mean you're saying that

5

(d)(2), "unreasonable determination of the facts," means

6

the factual outcome.

7

outcome is reasonable it doesn't matter if the

8

procedures are inadequate; is that your claim.

9

In other words, if the factual

MS. BURNETT:

Well, no.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

said that in answer to Justice Souter.

12

MS. BURNETT:

No?

I believe that -

I thought you just

I believe that (d)(2) very

13

clearly -- yes, I think I'm agreeing with you that

14

(d)(2) addresses the actual facts which underlay the

15

State court decision.

16
17

And not whether their

procedures are correct?

18

So that's the first

22

thing we have to decide to get to the question.

23

wrong on that -- and I doesn't know the answer to it -

24

if you're wrong on that, then they're rid of (d).

25

they say then, we're rid of (e) because it falls within

If your

1

(a)(2), the factual predicate and due diligence, okay.

2

They say we are rid of (e) because of that.

3

they get around capital (B) I'm not sure, but that isn't

4

in the case.

5

MS. BURNETT:

Now, how

Justice Breyer, I'm not sure

6

they they've argued those exceptions (a)(2) at (i) and

7

(ii).

I believe they're simply arguing -

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

They're arguing due

diligence.

10

MS. BURNETT:

My reading of their brief is

11

they are saying:

We are Michael Williams and all

12

Michael Williams dealt with was the opening sentence of

13

(e)(2).

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MS. BURNETT:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MS. BURNETT:

(I).

You mean of (e)(2) -

Of (e)(2).
(E)(2).

"If the applicant has failed

18

to develop," and Michael Williams interpreted that as

19

someone who has not been diligent in developing the

20

record.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So we also get -

22

they get around that because they say the due diligence.

23

You also have an argument about how (2) applies.

24

you're wrong about both of those then we get to the

25

question, which would be:

And if

on the merits.

If he's right there and it's exhaustion

decision that does not defer to the State court, because

2

MS. BURNETT:

That's not this case.

But in

4

unexhausted defaulted claims or facts that are presented

5

to a Federal court -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

There is no real

The Federal court simply

announced that he was going to hold a hearing on this

claim and decide later -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MS. BURNETT:

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe

first he had -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So maybe the district

4

court was dead wrong, but the assumption I think we made

5

when we took the case was that there was a body of

6

evidence that had not been available in the State

7

proceeding that might be available in the Federal

8

proceeding.

9
10

MS. BURNETT:

I think that was the

misunderstanding.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if that were true -- I

12

know you disagree with that and I understand your

13

argument.

14

if that were true and the Federal court then had to

15

decide on the basis of all the evidence, do you read the

16

statute to say at that time he may only rely on the

17

evidence presented to the State court?

18

Maybe we shouldn't have taken the case.

MS. BURNETT:

But

The way I read the statute is

19

that that is the first thing that the judge was required

20

to do.

21

court's decision was reasonable.

He had to first determine whether the State

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

All right.

Suppose he

23

looked at the State court evidence and he says, that was

24

not enough.

25

was reasonable based on that record.

The State court's decision on the merits

41
Alderson Reporting Company

I have a different

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

record before me.

2

May he look at the different record?

MS. BURNETT:

He can -- I think -- I think

then we are talking about what I was just saying, new

4

facts, new claims.

5
6
7

JUSTICE STEVENS:
about.

That's what we're talking

May he look at it?
MS. BURNETT:

And then the judge has to go

8

through the determination, before he can decide whether

9

he can look at it, of whether these new facts or new

10

claims meet cause and prejudice or actual innocence.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

All right.

Forget the

12

cause and prejudice for just a moment.

13

at that new evidence and he decides that any neutral

14

judge would have reached a different result from the

15

State judge on that evidence, may he reach that result?

16
17

MS. BURNETT:

But if he looks

I don't think just -- I do not

believe the judge can do that -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

MS. BURNETT:

Then what's the point -

-- just simply to say I'm

20

going to look at just the correctness of the decision

21

first, and then decide whether it's correct.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What you're saying is the

23

correctness of decision based on the State court record.

24

And if he decides there was a sound decision on that

25

record, that's the end of the ball game; is that your

position?

2

MS. BURNETT:

Well, I think it is, unless -

3

unless there are actually new matters that are presented

4

to the Federal court that the Federal court now is going

to -

the same claim.

asking whether it should.

MS. BURNETT:

I think -- I think that

doesn't really fit with the statute -- with the

statutory language.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it seems to me the

statute certainly contemplates that the States have the

first -

MS. BURNETT:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

thing, right?

11

Yes.
-- the first cut at this

How else do you give them the first cut?

MS. BURNETT:

Yes.

Absolutely.

And that's

12

what I'm saying, and I think that -- to -- if the claim

13

is going to in any way differ, it's going to change from

14

what was presented to the State court.

15

that is all new matters that are defaulted, and in a

16

very literal sense how can -- and I don't believe

17

Congress intended for Federal courts to look at new

18

matters, however they got to them, that were not

19

presented to the State court, and on that basis

20

determine whether the State court's decision was

21

reached.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

On one level,

So the Federal court is

supposed to do what?
MS. BURNETT:

The Federal court is supposed

to first look at the claim that was presented to the
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State court, under 2254(d), and the claimants before it.

2

If it's the same claim, if it's the same matters that

3

were adjudicated on the merits in the State court, it

4

has to make the decision up front, was it reasonable or

5

not?

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MS. BURNETT:

Okay.

Okay.

Now it makes that

8

decision, and then after that, if the Petitioner says

9

well, I have new matters, that I never presented to the

10
11

State court, the Federal court has a -- a road map.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now -- but the road map

12

that you are now saying could be followed is the same

13

road map implied by -- in your earlier answer to Justice

14

Scalia, your reference to the new claim as being a

15

defaulted claim.

16

MS. BURNETT:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But we are concerned -- I

18

think we are all concerned with the -- with the claim in

19

which it is not defaulted, in the sense that he is at

20

fault in any way for failing to get it into the Federal

21

court -- I'm sorry -- get his entire presentation now

22

into the State court then.

23

defaulted claim in the classic sense.

24

in which he is at fault by having failed to present it

25

in the State court.

So that it is not a

45
Alderson Reporting Company

It is not a claim

Official - Subject to Final Review

And in that case, if it cannot go back, if

2

the State court will not take it back, don't we have to

3

find at least implicit in the totality of subsections

4

(d) and (e) the possibility of litigating the -- the

5

fully developed claim in the Federal court without a

6

need to defer to the State court findings?

7

MS. BURNETT:

If implicit in your question

8

is -- yes, implicit in your question is that the

9

Petitioner has demonstrated cause; and he may or may not

10

have depending on the facts.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, he -- I agree with

12

you on the -- on the cause part; but the -- up to this

13

point.

14

at least he has got to develop cause.

ask you this question.

2

corner.

3

MS. BURNETT:

It may be.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If that is -- this Court -

5

that's why I'm saying it's a very established law as to

6

what cause is, and external impediments.

I mean, this

7

Court has many cases that describe that.

The lower

8

courts are very familiar with determining that, and so

9

they can -- they are capable to making that

10

determination as to whether the Federal court can now

11

look at a new matter whether it's a new claim or -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But all we are -- I think

13

all we are really getting at is that there are different

14

kinds of new matters.

stage, and he is now saying don't hold that against me:

i.e., I'm showing cause and I'll show prejudice.

19

tried to get into, and under our hypothesis, the State

MS. BURNETT:

room for the district court to hold an evidentiary

that's -- I think it's actually a separate matter.

23

first have to get to whether the Federal court can look

Are there

that make a difference?

Can you envisage

6

circumstances in which an ineffective counsel

7

assistance, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim

8

was presented in the State court and then there is a

9

second ineffective assistance in counsel's claims or a

10

further supplemental ineffective assistance of counsel

11

claim based on new evidence that the district court

12

might hear?

13

Does that ever happen?
MS. BURNETT:

I think it can happen,

14

certainly.

15

I mean, I think that it -- it is -- it is the same

16

analysis, no matter what the claim is, it's the same

17

analysis that the Federal court needs to go through to

18

look -- to see whether it can consider new matter.

19

I don't think it's restricted just to Brady.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you think there could

20

be instances, we might imagine, in which there could be

21

two ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the second

22

of which could be heard in the district court with

23

evidentiary -- with an evidentiary hearing?

24
25

MS. BURNETT:
possible.

I think it's certainly

I think that the statutory setup and this
49

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

So if it's not

14

unconstitutional, then you just provide what you say,

15

that the district court sees whether by clear and

16

convincing evidence the case would have come out the

17

other way.

18

If it were unconstitutional, and I guess

19

this is what is sticking in our craw -- my craw,

20

anyway -- if it were unconstitutional, it seems to me

21

there ought to be a way to make the State take the first

22

cut at it.

then in Federal habeas you would -- you would apply the

through is -- if I accept that the State court was right

MR. BRESS:

Exactly, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, it's a new claim

3

if it is one on which you would have prevailed, but it's

the same claim if the result would be the same.

5

MR. BRESS:

I don't -- I don't think it

6

necessarily has to be that way, Your Honor.

I think you

7

can have a case where the evidence that was before them

8

was absolutely nil; now they're offering a good bit of

9

evidence that you would at least want to weigh as an

10

objective jurist, even though you decide against them.

11

I think that's possible.

12

I think the reason you've got to adopt this

13

position, however, is that there is no DNA -- I mean, no
