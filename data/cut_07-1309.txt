CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument in Case 07-1309, Boyle v. United States.
Mr. Fernich.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARC FERNICH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. FERNICH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This is a case about a defendant's right to

11

an independent jury determination of each essential

12

element of a RICO offense, specifically a pattern of

13

racketeering and a separate enterprise that is more than

14

just a duplication of the pattern.

15

To keep the elements apart, ensure their

16

distinct consideration, and give the enterprise

17

independent meaning, juries must be instructed, as in

18

the Seventh Circuit and elsewhere, that an "enterprise"

19

requires a structure separate from the commission of the

20

predicate acts forming the pattern.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. FERNICH:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fernich -

Yes, Your Honor.
-- are we talking just

24

about the instruction to the jury?

25

that the instruction given here was incorrect.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

I know you think
But is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it just a question of charge error or are you saying

2

that there was insufficient evidence of enterprise for

3

this case to go to the jury?

4

MR. FERNICH:

I am not suggesting, Your

5

Honor, that there was insufficient evidence of -- of

6

enterprise to go to the jury.

7

respect to the charge.

8
9

My primary point is with

We do contend -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're saying if a proper

charge had been given, this jury on this evidence still

10

could have convicted the defendant?

11

MR. FERNICH:

We contend, to be sure, that

12

the evidence was legally insufficient under Rule 29.

13

But we are pressing principally the first -- the jury

14

argument claim here in this Court.

15

the evidence was legally insufficient.

16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We do contend that

Did you make that -- did

you make that objection in the trial court?

18

MR. FERNICH:

19

it in the court of appeals as well.

20

Your Honor knows, no published opinion with respect to

21

either issue, so both issues are preserved.

22

Yes, we did, and we preserved
And there was, as

Now, Your Honor, under the Second Circuit

23

rule that functionally conflates the two elements, that

24

is enterprise and pattern, the jury in this case was not

25

so instructed as to the need for an enterprise with an
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

existence separate and apart from the racketeering acts

2

forming the pattern.

3

the judgment below must be vacated.

4

For that reason we contend that

JUSTICE ALITO:

The -- the error was the

5

failure to give the instruction that appears on page 95

6

of the joint appendix?

7

complaining about?

8
9

MR. FERNICH:

Is that the error that you are

Not merely so, Justice Alito.

That is why the entire relevant excerpts from the jury

10

charge are included in the joint appendix.

11

to the entirety of the charge, in addition to requesting

12

specific language of our own.

13

error of which we complain in this Court is the failure

14

of that instruction anywhere to require, as this Court

15

required in the United States v Turkette, and as 18

16

U.S.C. 1962(c) itself requires, an entity with a

17

structure separate and apart from the pattern of

18

racketeering.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We objected

To be sure, the principal

What -- what do you mean by

20

that precisely?

Suppose you have a group of people, the

21

ringleader goes and gets a safecracker, he gets a

22

wheelman, and so forth, all the people he needs for the

23

crime; and he says we are going to call this the -- the

24

Brinks Job Group, okay?

25

But that's the only thing that he has put the group

We are the Brinks Job Group.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

together in order to do.

2

calls it a group and he gets all these guys together and

3

they -- they meet and have lunch together, and do a lot

4

of stuff together.

5
6

But it's still a group.

He

Would that meet your -- your condition of a
separate association from the predicate acts?

7

MR. FERNICH:

To be sure, we would contend

8

that it would be a question in the first instance for a

9

properly instructed jury, but without more on the

10

hypothetical that Your Honor has posited, the answer to

11

that question is no.

There is no ongoing decisional

MR. FERNICH:

Except the degree of

16

organization, I should say, inherent in each individual

23

24

something to that effect.

25

says.

It doesn't seem to me conclusive of your

In order to answer Justice Scalia, you had to
You had to say -

That is not what Turkette

Turkette says "as proven by evidence of an
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ongoing organization, formal or informal, that is

2

continuing."

3

That's all it says.

MR. FERNICH:

To be sure, Your Honor, we

4

don't contend that Turkette is directly controlling of

5

the issue and we go through a lengthy textual exegesis

6

in our brief of why we think that implicit in the

7

factors of ongoing organization and continuing unit is a

8

structure requirement.

9

unequivocally say is that there must be an entity

But what Turkette did

10

existing separate and apart from the pattern of

11

racketeering activity.

12

given in this case -- and the word "entity," which

13

appears in section 1961(4) itself and appears twice in

14

the Turkette decision, surely connotes an ascertainable

15

structure with an existence separate and apart from the

16

pattern of racketeering.

17

There was no such instruction

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What does "structure"

18

mean?

I think you said it doesn't mean that this has to

19

be an organization with a president, a treasurer; it

20

doesn't mean that.

21

MR. FERNICH:

It could mean that in an

22

appropriate case, Your Honor.

23

probative -

It surely would be

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is -- what is the

25

minimum to qualify as having a structure?
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FERNICH:

The minimum is a separate,

2

ongoing, continuing existence apart from the commission

3

of the predicate acts themselves, and the members

4

necessary to commit those predicate acts, because that

5

by definition, I should say, is the pattern of

6

racketeering activity; and moreover, it is also inherent

7

in any criminal conspiracy that extends over time.

8
9

To be more specific, the bare minimum
requisites for a structure would be:

an ongoing

10

directional mechanism; a continuing decisional-making

11

unit -- decisionmaking unit, I should say -- and some

12

sort of coherent existence between the commission of the

13

racketeering acts themselves.

14

ingredients.

15

Those are the main

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So all you have to

16

do, to pick up on Justice Scalia's hypothetical, is just

17

not the Brinks job, but you have to have one more crime,

18

and that's it; then everything you've talked about is

19

satisfied?

20

MR. FERNICH:

No, that is, respectfully, not

21

what we contend, although in an appropriate case it is

22

conceivable that a properly instructed jury may find

23

structure on those facts.

24

conveying here is that this is principally a jury

25

question, and a jury that is properly instructed will

The point that we are

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

make findings, presumably, as to what the -- whether the

2

structure was extant, and those findings would command

3

substantial deference on appeal, as they do in the

4

circuits that have applied a structure requirement; and

5

it would be a relatively easy task for an appellate

6

court to defer to the jury's findings in such a case.

7

There is a -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The jury -- the words

that you asked for, what was it?

"Ascertainable

7

you please tell us specifically?

8
9

The judge gives your charge, the

Your Honor, we don't understand what

MR. FERNICH:

Yes, Your Honor.

First of

all, the charge that we are asking for specifically is a

10

charge that is given in the Seventh and Eighth Circuits

11

which says a structure separate from the commission of

12

the predicate acts themselves.

13

in that instance the judge could, as spelled out in

14

pages 31 through 35 of our reply brief, give examples,

15

any number of examples that have been spelled out by the

16

lower courts in -- that have adopted a structure

17

requirement.

If a jury were puzzled,

Your Honor, first of all, to

get right down to the nitty-gritty of the verdict in the

case, it's important to focus on what the jury actually

10

enterprise.

11

12

through early January of 1999.

is certainly something that we dispute here.

don't for a minute concede that the evidence was legally

19

sufficient under rule 29.

20

19

And it seems to me that all of the

to prevent the subversion and infiltration of legitimate

16

It is a -- and it is a result that squares with

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, absolutely.

But it

17

seems to me that it -- it puts you in sort of a -- a

18

difficult position to -- to be calling for or -- or

19

requiring jury instructions that call for, as necessary

20

conditions, findings of structure, continuity, decision

21

making, capacity and so on, when in fact on -- on at

22

least one variety of enterprise, these conditions are -

23

To be sure, Your Honor, we are

2

context of an association-in-fact enterprise.

3

weight of authority and the plain language of 1961(4)

4

does not define an individual as an association-in-fact

5

enterprise.

language of the statute to call an individual an

7

association-in-fact enterprise.

8

would create a whole set of other problems,

9

distinctly -

And it does not square with the plain

And, moreover, doing so

MR. FERNICH:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, I agree, but an

A legal enterprise.
And -- and an association,

14

in fact, can be an enterprise.

15

two propositions, then I think you've got a tough row to

16

hoe in saying that any enterprise which is not an

17

individual has got to have all the formal

18

characteristics that you talk about, given the fact that

19

those characteristics are automatically satisfied by an

20

individual.

21

MR. FERNICH:

And if we accept those

We don't -- we don't press

22

that contention, Your Honor.

We specifically press it

23

for the phrase "any union or group of individuals

24

associated in fact, although not a legal entity."

25

"individual" portion appears in the first clause of the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute.

The distinctness problem simply does not arise

2

in the context of a legal-entity enterprise.

3

And it's important to note, as this Court

4

said in Salinas -- recognized in Salinas ---virtually

5

every criminal prosecution that is brought under 1962(c)

6

is brought against an illicit association-in-fact

7

enterprise.

8

an association-in-fact enterprise, I don't think it's a

9

valid association-in-fact enterprise as a matter of law.

The -- the scenario of an individual being

10

There is a line of cases from the Seventh Circuit that

11

says it's not.

12

And this structural problem, having a

13

structure that is distinct from the pattern of

14

racketeering activities so that the two elements, I

15

should say, are kept separate and apart, only arises in

16

the context of an association-in-fact enterprise, which

17

is, of course, a very, very wide swath.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would it include, let's

19

say, a street gang?

How about -- this may be before

And again, to answer

JUSTICE ALITO:

If hierarchy is not

10

required, then I'm not clear what more -- what you think

11

needs to be shown beyond the fact that there was an

12

association in fact and whatever continuity needs to be

13

shown in order to establish the pattern.

14

needs to be shown beyond that?

MR. FERNICH:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17
18

What -- what

Well, Your Honor What needs to be charged to

the jury that they must find beyond that?
MR. FERNICH:

We contend that they must be

19

charged that there has to be a structure separate from

20

the commission of the predicate acts themselves.

instructions that give that precise charge.

Suppose you have a gang that

gets together every Friday afternoon and by democratic

means they decide what crime they are going to commit

they look at the whole list of RICO predicates, and they

choose a different one each -- you know, each weekend to

commit.

in doing that they perform different roles at different

times.

10

And they are multi-talented so they -

And they do that over some period of time, and

Is -- is that an enterprise?
MR. FERNICH:

It sounds to me like a jury

could -- if they are having regular Friday meetings and

they are using sophisticated means to canvas the RICO

13

statute with a degree of complexity and sophistication

14

to figure out what they are going to do or maybe even

15

try to evade the statute, it probably -

MR. FERNICH:

It may have at that point, but

there was no evidence -- and -- and because it's outside

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

An association-in-fact enterprise need not

8

have an ascertainable structure distinct from the

9

predicate act of racketeering committed by one of its

10

associates, whatever that means.

RICO's statutory text,

11

its surrounding context, and this Court's construction

12

of the statute show that RICO's definition of

13

"enterprise" is broad and contains no such limitation.

14

Petitioner's primary argument, that the term

15

"enterprise" is rendered superfluous and merges with the

16

charged pattern of racketeering acts, is wrong for at

17

least three reasons:

18

matter.

19

pattern is a series of acts.

Second, it fails to

Wait, wait, wait, wait,

22

wait.

I assume that he was responding to the argument

23

that you can establish the enterprise from the mere

24

existence of the pattern of the acts, from the separate

25

acts.

And if indeed it takes nothing more than the acts
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to constitute the enterprise, it seems to me he has a

2

point.

3

MR. YANG:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5
6

That goes to my second reason.
Oh, so we'll forget about

your first one.
MR. YANG:

Well, let me go to -- which I

7

think it addresses the second reason.

It's distinct as

8

a formal matter, which is that have you to have find a

9

group of individuals versus a series of facts.

You can

10

infer the group from their actions, just as can you

11

infer, you know, a relationship between individuals by

12

the way they act together.

But -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. YANG:

So -

My first point is a formal one.

15

The second point goes straight to the statute:

16

relevant pattern of racketeering acts that is at issue

17

in RICO -- this is 1962(c) -- is a pattern of acts

18

committed by an individual defendant, not a group.

19

fact, in H.J. this Court explained that the premise that

20

the pattern has to be performed by a group or an

21

association -- this is at page 244 of the Court's

22

opinion there -- was wrong and that the pattern can be

23

fully the work of an individual acting alone.

24
25

That the

In

It's also wrong because an enterprise
remains wholly distinct and pertinent in numerous RICO
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contexts under the government's interpretation.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

When you say "individual,"

3

the first part of the definition of "enterprise" speaks

4

about any individual partnership, corporation,

5

association, or other legal entity.

6

MR. YANG:

That's correct.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So then, I've read

8

somewhere that people feel that where that individual is

9

involved, the individual is acting as an -- a legal

10

entity such as a sole proprietorship.

11

MR. YANG:

Is that right?

An individual can be an

12

enterprise as a sole proprietorship, if that's the

13

question.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm talking about a legal

15

entity.

16

about here, specifically, it is "a corporation, a union,

17

or a group of individuals associated in fact although

18

not a legal entity."

And in the second clause, what we are talking

That's correct.

The gray brief.

So what's

7

relevant for purposes of showing an element of a 1962(c)

8

violation is that the defendant alone, perhaps with

9

others, but the element is the defendant has to commit a

10

pattern of racketeering.

There are other elements.

11

instance, the defendant has to do so in a manner that

12

participates in the conduct of the affairs of the

2

know, has an ongoing plan, but that doesn't mean that

3

it's not a separate element that the jury should have to

find.

MR. YANG:

We don't say that it's not a

6

separate element, and we also don't say that a pattern

7

necessarily would -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you say that

it's not distinct from the underlying offenses.

10

MR. YANG:

No, I don't believe so.

I think

what we have said is that the evidence regarding the

12

pattern of activity allows the jury to infer the

13

existence of an enterprise because an enterprise -

do they?

enterprise, and the jury may not infer an enterprise

Here you still have to show an

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

from the pattern, but certainly it's open to the jury.

2

When that pattern -- again, a pattern is an individual's

3

conduct -- but when that pattern is shown through

4

evidence that the individual is acting with others over

5

a long period of time -- to either establish that it's a

6

pattern of racketeering activity, if that same evidence

7

not only shows that the individual committed a pattern

8

of racketeering activity, but it was done in concert

9

with others and that the -- that evidence shows that a

10

group of individuals had associated in fact for the

11

common purpose of engaging in criminal conduct.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would you agree there could

13

be a situation in which an individual engages in a

14

pattern of racketeering activity together with other

15

people and yet is not participating in the affairs of an

16

enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity?

17

MR. YANG:

Well, I think that's the case

18

that we gave -- an example that we gave in our brief,

19

which is saying an individual commits a very long string

20

of bank burglaries and -- actually, make it robberies.

21

Robbery is a predicate act; burglary is not.

22

burglaries with individuals, but each time he does it,

23

it's with a different group of individuals.

24

-- the individual would be established -- you could

25

establish a pattern from, say, the relatedness of the

MR. YANG:

would -

MR. YANG:

What's lacking there?

What would show is that the

10

individual is not working in concert with others to

11

achieve an end.

12

any two of the crimes except for the individual acting

13

alone.

14

There's no parallel identity between

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought an

enterprise?

17

MR. YANG:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One -- he could be An independent

contractor rather than an employee.
MR. YANG:

He could be an enterprise but not

one -- when an individual acts an alone as an

22

enterprise, the individual is not liability for

23

racketeering acts under 1962(c) under this Court's

24

decision in Cedric Kushner, because there's a

25

requirement in 1962(c) that the individual has to be
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

employed by or associated with the enterprise.

2

3

distinctiveness between the enterprise itself and the

individual.

5

And this

So with respect to the individual, there

would be no -- there might be an enterprise.

Then why don't you dispense

with the association-in-fact category and simply go with

2

the individual?

3

MR. YANG:

be distinctiveness in that context.

happens if three months from now the postal inspector

it's a threat of continuing activity or because it would

to catch the same problem.

don't think anyone sees that the simple conspiracy in

carrying out of two criminal offenses by several people

violate RICO.

I have to say I'm a little

12

perplexed at this stage in the litigation based -- how

13

we got here based on the objection that was made to the

14

district court.

structural hierarchy which seems to be abandoned at this

17

point, distinct from the charged predicated acts of

racketeering, that was repeated at 103, 108, and 109.

19

And then there was also an objection that the entity has

20

to have a particular or formed structure, and that has

21

been abandoned and also inconsistent with Turkette,

22

which recognized that this could be an informal

23

association.

22

what did you think of my effort there?

to point out, as you see, I am open to anything that

know who they are, and they are going to be shown this

conflating the elements so that every single case that

you have the first set, you also have the second set.

MR. YANG:

That problem does not exist as

8

well, because the relevant pattern of racketeering

9

activity that is the element of the crime is something

10

committed by individuals.

11

For instance, let's take a group of

12

individuals who commit a long string, of, for instance,

13

burglaries, they do so over a series of years.

burglary is not a predicate act of racketeering; it's a

wholly criminal organization; all they do is commit bank

burglaries.

18

there is a RICO violation after the individual, because

across State lines, and that is a RICO predicate; but

the other things that the group was doing, those are not

other people -- let's say he brings his buddy along, two

show that the individual -- the evidence showed that the

racketeering activity and he is doing it in concert with

others, but that goes to the separate element of

That would show that he -- the

That's right, and our

problem is he is doing it with one other person whom he

met once, and they agreed to do it, and it's a common

law conspiracy; and now suddenly he has done it twice

with another person who helped him and they said they

would do it, and now we have RICO; and my belief is -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I am -- I am really

6

confused now.

I don't -- I am not sure I know what your

7

answer to the question presented is, which is quite

8

simply must an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO

9

have some ascertainable structure beyond that inherent

10

in the commission of predicate crimes by its members and

11

associates?

12

And you -- your answer is no?

13

MR. YANG:

14

No.

I mean, I guess it depends

on what you mean -- ascertainable structure -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. YANG:

Yes.

It's very -- I have to say it's

17

difficult for me to understand what is being proposed by

the other side, particularly once you have lost

understandable term.

Hierarchy is something which is an

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. YANG:

But if you are talking about

MR. YANG: -- commit their crimes.

If that's

the case -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. YANG:

Yes.

-- I don't see why a jury cannot

5

infer from the fact that over a long period of time the

6

alleged members of this group have operated as a unit

7

and have committed acts of racketeering, from that

8

coordinating conduct that you were not able to infer

9

that they had a means of acting as a group.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but you would have to

11

tell the jury -- you would have to tell the jury you

12

would have to find it.

13

but the issue is must the jury be told that it has to

14

find it?

Of course the jury can find it,

I think he's conceding -

15

MR. YANG:

Must the jury -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Be told it's not enough,

17

ladies and gentlemen of the jury, for you to find that

18

these predicate acts occurred; you must find -- and you

19

can find it just from the predicate acts, if you think

20

the evidence will justify that -- you must find an

21

organization separate from the mere commission of the

22

predicate acts.

23

MR. YANG:

What does that mean?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

(Laughter.)

I don't know.

So if for instance, take a few

Nothing else, just predicate acts, over a

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. YANG:

Right.

All right?

One formulation of

10

petitioners is you have to look at the charged pattern

11

of racketeering acts, presumably because then the jury

12

has to find the charged pattern and then that has to be

13

distinct from the enterprise.

14

let's say there is 100 predicate acts of racketeering.

15

All that does is say that the government has to show 99

16

and leave the last one uncharged.

17

If that is the case -

That makes no sense.

To the extent that Petitioners say that

18

okay, there has got to be some -- something other than

19

racketeering activity, take for instance, the group that

20

does wholly legal, but does criminal non-racketeering

21

acts as well as racketeering acts; that's in fact this

22

case.

which is not a predicate act, and interstate

briefs or in the materials do we find the definition of

what the enterprise is, other than in the statute, other

4

than the terms of the statute itself?

MR. YANG:

I believe page 17.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, in other -- what

7

do I refer to in order to supplement the instruction

8

that I just noted -- that I just suggested?

9

MR. YANG:

Page 17 of our brief reiterates

10

the standard, I believe it's Turkette, it comes from

11

Turkette and in the appendix to petition -- or excuse

12

me, to the joint appendix, the charge is at pages 111

13

through 113.

14

That's the charge.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's at the bottom of

15

111 where it said you can look to see what it does and

16

make the inference rather than have -- I forget -- an

17

abstract analysis?

18

MR. YANG:

But it goes on to say that you

19

must -- the government must prove that there is an

20

ongoing organization with some similar framework, formal

21

and informal, for carrying out its objectives and

22

various members and associations of the association

23

function as a continuing unit to achieve a common

24

objective.

25

The government must prove that in every

case.

2

in the court of appeals appendix at page 8770, the

3

district court specifically charged the jury that they

4

must find five separate elements of a RICO offense,

5

including the existence of an enterprise as one; two,

6

that the enterprise engaged in or its activity affected

7

interstate or foreign commerce; three, that the

8

defendant was associated in it.

9

In this case, this is not in the J.A., but it is

Eventually you get down to five, that the

10

defendant knowingly participated in the conduct of the

11

affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of

12

racketeering.

So the district court explained you have to

14

define an enterprise.

16

from what the -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say enterprise.

18

I mean, the objection is that the enterprise is no

19

different than the various predicate acts.

20

MR. YANG:

It is different in the sense that

21

you can have a series of predicate acts without an

22

enterprise, you can have an enterprise without a series

23

of predicate acts.

24

ultimately that the evidence needs to show the predicate

25

acts of racketeering may also prove that the enterprise

Now what, the objection seems to be

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exists, because when you show predicate acts of a

2

defendant, which is the only element, he doesn't have to

3

work in concert with others to commit the predicate acts

4

of racketeering, but when you show the predicate acts

5

with evidence that individual is acting with others, you

6

can also show that they have -- there is an association

7

in fact of individuals who joined together to pursue a

common course of conduct.

14

MR. FERNICH:

Thank you, Your Honor.

15

Very briefly, nobody disputes the

proposition that a properly instructed jury would be

able to find that racketeering acts committed by an

individual is a distinct element from the

19

association-in-fact enterprise.

20

absolutely right and we agree on that score.

21

problem is the lower courts have misread Turkette.

22

are not focusing on the pattern of activity committed by

the individual; they have -- and the instruction as

problem.

We agree that patterns of racketeering

activity are properly committed by individuals.

If you

10

are going to define the enterprise solely or principally

11

by virtue of the pattern, whose pattern would you define

it by?

13

Turkette, it -- with respect to what occurred in

The second point I would like to make:
51

the

Official - Subject to Final Review

enterprise in its brief, and what I hear here from the

we would certainly agree with Justice Breyer's

formulation that something to differentiate it as a

long-term, goal-directed, decisionmaking apparatus that

continues in the intervals between the predicate acts

would do it, but we contend that structure is largely,

it's a plain English word, it's not

antidisestablishmentarianism or something like that; the

from the pattern.

the judge could list examples tailored to the
