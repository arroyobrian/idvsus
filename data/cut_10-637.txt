CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 10-637, Greene v. Fisher.
Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

Any decision announced from this Court

11

before a State prisoner's conviction becomes final

12

constitutes clearly established law for purposes of

13

applying section 2254(d) of AEDPA.

14

fact, it has been a bedrock rule under Teague and

15

Griffith that State prisoners are entitled to the

16

benefit of decisions from this Court that come down

17

before finality, and that rule has delivered fairness

18

and clarity to an area that that this Court has

19

acknowledged previously lacked it.

20

compelling reason to chart a new course now.

21

For decades, in

There's no

There's no doubt that AEDPA changed Federal

22

habeas law in many important ways, but it did not change

23

habeas law with respect to retroactivity, for under this

24

Court's Teague jurisprudence, States already had comity,

25

as opposed to other areas.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Fisher, we

2

wouldn't have this problem, at least not in this case,

3

if your client had -- had sought cert, right?

4

then presumably when his petition came before the Court,

5

our normal practice would have been to GVR it, because

6

the decision would come out the other way under -- under

7

Gray, right?

may well have GVR'ed, but realize that this Court isn't bound

3

to do that.

and I don't think this Court wants to take on the

5

responsibility of deciding every single case that falls

6

into a twilight zone situation.

This Court has discretionary jurisdiction,

-- the State filed in its own supreme court, wrapped up

10

in procedural arguments, harmless error allegations,

11

perhaps alternative State grounds.

12

has decided that habeas is the better place to work that

out, not GVR.

think the Court wants to take on that responsibility.

procedurally complicated, the Court leaves it.

I think there are cases
Because they are so

And, in fact, I can think of one case right

now in California.

After Melendez-Diaz, there was a

case called Geyer that came out of the California

8

courts, that this Court did -- held for Melendez-Diaz

9

but did not GVR, in part because I think the State was

10

making harmless error allegations there.

States and California are trying to figure out what to

do in light of that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Normally, I think if

it looks like a mess procedurally, or whatever, the

19

normal assumption is you let the lower court figure it

20

out.

21

that in actually most cases in which we GVR, the court

reinstates the judgment below for one reason or -- or

another.

that if he has a lawyer he's going to bring it up here.

MR. FISHER:

more question on the GVR, at least.

16

If you had sought -- if you had been

17

counsel -- you're not.

If you had been Greene's counsel

18

and you had sought cert from this Court, you would have

19

sought cert to the supreme -- the Superior Court of

20

Pennsylvania, to the intermediate court, correct?

21

MR. FISHER:

Correct, I think that's right.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Which indicates that that

23

is the decision that's -- that's involved here.

24

once that decision becomes final, then you have a

problem.

If -- if the protocol or the practice or the

2

rules had been that you would seek cert to the

3

Pennsylvania Supreme Court, then you might have had an

argument about finality, but now you don't.

5

get to that later, because the -- the Chief Justice had

a second part of his question which was collateral.

So let me address that.

Your Honor, that we would have been able -- Mr. Greene

10

the controlling decision, and they would have accepted

scenario.

this didn't GVR, or he did seek review in the

22

Pennsylvania courts and they refused to hear it.

23

And under the State's position, even then

24

you would bar him from getting the reliance on Gray,

25

because Gray came down after the Pennsylvania Supreme -10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, apparently the

Pennsylvania Supreme Court thought that he hadn't

6

improvident most likely because Greene had not raised

I mean, they initially granted

MR. FISHER:

Well, he very much had raised

the Gray issue below, Justice Ginsburg.

You're

10

absolutely right that the State, faced with really no

11

alternative but to try to argue waiver, did argue waiver

12

in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which did dismiss the

13

case.

14

dismissed the case.

15

the lower courts, and the Third Circuit squarely held

16

that Mr. Greene had, in fact, preserved this claim in

17

the Pennsylvania courts, and on top of that, the

18

Pennsylvania Superior Court had reached it and resolved

19

-- understood him to be raising a Gray-type argument and

20

resolved it by citing a Pennsylvania case that had

21

previously held that just putting an X in place of -- in

place of the defendant's name was good enough to satisfy

Bruton.

in a decision that was contrary --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, the decision -- what

12

decision did the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania make

13

other than the decision not to hear the case?

14

MR. FISHER:

No, it's the decision from the

15

Pennsylvania Superior Court, Justice Scalia, that's

16

contrary to clearly established law as of the date of

17

finality.

So, you have to -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not as of the date they

made it.
MR. FISHER:

20

That's not the date they made

21

it, no.

But the question of contrary to, as this Court

22

said in Williams and has repeated many times, is whether

23

the lower court either did one of two things:

24

case -- decided the case with a question of law and

25

decided the question of law opposite as how this Court

indistinguishable facts.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how do you square your

5

argument with Pinholster?

Because I thought that what

6

we said in Pinholster just last year is no Monday

8

of the court at the time.

9

looked at.

We put ourselves in the position
We look at what the court

We know what the court knew, and we make a

10

decision on that ground.

11

argument just runs smack into that holding.

12

MR. FISHER:

And it seems to me that your

Justice Kagan, no, we don't

13

think it does, because there has always been a

14

difference between facts and law.

15

course held in Pinholster that you look at the factual

16

record that existed before the State court, but ordinary

17

appellate review and principles have always allowed new

18

law to be considered up to a certain point.

19

So, this Court of

And so, it's consistent with Pinholster to

20

say you take the set of facts, just as you would from a

21

trial court, but that new law up to the point of

22

finality is -- can be considered.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I understand how there

24

can be a distinction between facts and law for many

25

purposes, but Pinholster rested on a view of the
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute, which was basically the view that Justice Alito

2

gave you, which said everything in this statute is

3

framed in the past tense.

4

at is -- is the decision at the time the State court

5

made it.

6

MR. FISHER:

What the statute is getting

We don't -- again, we don't

7

disagree at all that it's in the past tense.

The

8

question is where in the past is the cutoff?

And so,

9

what we say is -- and it's important what this Court did

10

say in Pinholster.

In Pinholster, it didn't say that

11

the plain language of 2254(d) resolved this.

12

that -- I think I'm going to get this quote right --

13

that the structure of the statute compelled the

14

conclusion that for facts you leave the window.

15

the structure of this statute as to law compels the

16

opposite conclusion.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It said

Well,

Why?

For a few reasons -Because the statute says

20

adjudication resulted in a decision.

And the decision,

21

the only decision, is the Pennsylvania Superior Court,

22

because there was a non-decision by the Pennsylvania

23

Supreme Court.

24

that was.

25

much stronger argument if it had read "resulted in a

Resulted -- that is -- in a decision

It didn't say "is." I mean, you would have a

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision that is contrary."

2

that sounds like at the time of the adjudication.

3

MR. FISHER:

But when it says "was,"

Well, Justice Ginsburg, if I

4

can get this point across.

5

then there would be no -- there would be no

6

retroactivity cutoff whatsoever.

7

statute says "was," but it's was as of when?

8

"was" as of the time of finality.

9

read into the statute "was" as of the time the decision

10

was made.

11

I'm not saying "is," because

I agree that the
We say

The State wants to

And so, that's the question you have.
And if you look to the structure of the

12

statute, you'll see lots of clues that Congress didn't

13

intend to change the previous clear retroactivity cutoff

14

at Teague.

15

has to overcome here, a clear and specific change in

16

18

had in mind when it did that.

22

And, of course, that's the barrier the State

If you look at the limitations provision, it
If you look at various provisions

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And this Court

So -Counsel, how do you --

23

how do you get past Horn?

Horn says that Teague and

24

AEDPA are two different analyses that each case must

25

undergo, that you start with, okay, what does Teague
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say, but you then look at what AEDPA says, and that each

2

can serve as an independent bar.

3

case, how do you get around AEDPA's requirement of a

4

past-looking statute being one that involves the

5

adjudication and whether at its time it was contrary to

6

Supreme Court precedent?

7

MR. FISHER:

So, if that's the

Justice Sotomayor, we think

8

Horn is another structural component of the statute that

9

shows why we win.

And let me explain why.

Again, we

10

don't disagree it's a backward-looking statute, but

11

backward-looking to finality.

12

Horn rejected a form of the very same argument that the

13

State is making today, which is 2254(d) changes

14

retroactivity law to establish the cutoff at the time of

15

the State court decision, not as of finality.

16

Court rejected that argument and said, no, Teague and

17

2254(d) are distinct.

18

understand them as distinct is to understand that

19

2254(d) deals with the standard of review, and Teague

20

still continues to control finality.

21

Now, what Horn held --

This

And we think the best way to

Now, in light of Horn -- I'm sorry --

22

retroactivity.

Now, in light of Horn on the books, if

23

the State were right that what 2254(d) is actually

24

trying to do is also do retroactivity work and prevent

25

the State courts from, as it put in its brief, being
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"blind-sided," then Teague would serve -- no

2

longer serve any purpose, and Horn would have had to

3

come out the other way, because once you say 2254(d) is

4

actually concerned with setting a cutoff at the time of

5

the last State court decision for retroactivity

6

purposes, you don't need Teague anymore.

7

have had to come out the other way if the State is

8

right.

So, Horn would

9

Now, let me go back to one other structural

10

feature of the statute that -- that shows that Congress

11

had in mind that Teague would continue, and that's the

12

one I referenced earlier with respect to retroactivity.

13

Keep in mind the State's argument would bar not just

14

somebody like Greene from relying on a new case like

15

Gray, but it would also -- the implication would be it

16

would bar him from relying on a new case like Roper v.

17

Simmons, Graham v. Florida, or other cases that alter --

18

that say the Constitution can no longer cover or punish

19

substantive conduct in a certain way.

20

if Teague is out of the picture --

That's -- that's different than -MR. FISHER:

It's not different -- under the

5

State's view of AEDPA, Justice Kennedy.

6

State's view of AEDPA is that if a decision comes down

7

after the latest State court's decision on the merits,

8

Atkins claims that the lower courts -- the only way they

16

have reached them is by saying that Teague still has a

17

role to play with respect to 2254(d).

24

haven't quite focused on this, and, in fact, it's

25

because for many, many years after AEDPA was passed,

Now, some of the lower courts

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

States didn't even make the argument that you have

2

before you today.

3

which came to this court just a couple of years ago, the

4

State of Ohio, for example, was not even making this

5

argument, which is quite odd if you step back for a 


6

moment and realize that the State's position today is 


7

that the plain text of AEDPA is so clear there's no 


8

possible way you could read it in any other direction. 


9

So --


All the way through Smith v. Spisak,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

Mr. Fisher, what about

11

the -- well, the purpose of AEDPA was to require the

12

Federal courts to respect the State courts' decision.

13

And there's only been one decision in this picture, and

14

that decision was the Pennsylvania Superior Court.

15

we are not giving much respect to that decision, which

16

did not have the benefit of Gray, if we're going to say,

17

no, we have to look at that decision as though Gray were

18

already on the books.

19

MR. FISHER:

And

So, Justice Ginsburg, let me

20

answer that question by starting, if I may, before

21

AEDPA, because before AEDPA, under Caspari and Teague,

22

there's no doubt whatsoever that that's what a Federal

23

habeas corpus court would have done, is say the cutoff is

24

finality.

Because, remember, finality doesn't exist in

25

a vacuum.

It exists against the Griffith rule.
20

Alderson Reporting Company

And so,

Official

1

what Federal courts had always asked is, did the

2

defendant not get credit for a case that he's entitled

3

to under Griffith?

4

And so, the question is:

Did AEDPA change

5

that rule?

And, Justice Ginsburg, you asked about the

6

purpose or spirit of AEDPA.

7

AEDPA is, is to give States deference and to give them

8

comity where they otherwise didn't have it at the time.

9

And so, it changed the standard of review, it changed

We think what the spirit of

10

the statute of limitations, but it didn't need to change

11

Teague.

12

as this Court had explained in Teague itself, in Justice

13

Kennedy's long opinion in Wright v. West concurring, the

14

very purpose of Teague was to give States the comity

15

that -- of not foisting new law upon them.

16

It didn't need to change retroactivity because,

And so, you do end up, of course, in this

17

situation, which is -- I think we called it earlier the

18

twilight zone or perfect storm situation.

19

something that this Court saw coming under Teague and

20

long ago, even though even under those cases this Court

21

said the purpose of retroactivity law is not to hold the

22

States responsible for something new.

23

But this is

And so, the question is why did we have this

24

twilight zone under Teague and why should it continue

25

today?

And the answer again is because Teague doesn't
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exist in a vacuum; it works in tandem with Griffith.

2

Remember, what Griffith said is that it violates basic

3

norms of constitutional adjudication for a defendant to

4

not get the credit for a decision that this Court

5

announces before his State conviction becomes final.

6

And so, Teague is necessary as the other

7

side of the coin to make Griffith work.

And to undo all

8

of that and to go back to an unsettled state of

9

retroactivity law, whether it's -- whether it's

10

Linkletter or something else, is going to really cause

11

problems.

12

States' situation --

Let me give you one other image that the

If you look at the Pennsylvania

Superior Court decision and say, as of that time, the --

there was no violation of any clearly established law,

17

period.

Why is that complicated?

18

Then he's going to go into State

cutoff at the Pennsylvania -- I'm sorry -- the State

14

retroactivity cutoff at finality for certain other

15

claims.

16

that, it's just difficult. In Cullen v. Pinholster --

17

You have a retroactivity cutoff at the

21

result with respect to claims that were adjudicated on

22

direct review and any claim that was pushed over to

23

collateral review.

So, naturally, you'd have a different

example, about whether this claim is the same claim that

7

was brought, or the State supreme court decided this

8

claim but not the other claim, and whether the States --

9

With our system, you simply look at the

Under the State system,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm sorry, but

10

I mean, my point is that it seems a pretty weak

11

criticism of a result that it requires you to go claim

12

by claim, when the statute specifically requires you to

13

go claim by claim.

14

MR. FISHER:

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

it seems to me would have to be with Congress.

17

MR. FISHER:

No, I -The objection there

I'm not objecting to the

18

claim-by-claim nature of the approach.

I'm just saying

19

it would be unwieldy and administratively difficult,

20

and, therefore, I think you can question whether

21

Congress would have contemplated not just going claim by

22

claim for purposes of adjudication, but for purposes of

23

retroactivity analysis.

24

problems that I don't think anyone would argue, and I

25

don't think the State has even contended, that Congress

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm having trouble

4

following it.

It may be my fault.

But I -- but the --

5

suppose the Supreme Court has now some kind of

6

interpretation of something that's new.

7

Now, there are going to be a wide range of people that

8

that many might apply to whose convictions became final

9

or just about final in State courts at different times.

All right.

10

So, it's obviously always going to be somewhat unfair

11

and somewhat arbitrary that it applies to some and not

12

to others.

13

So, what is the problem here?

What -- the

14

reading of the statute on the other side says:

15

tell you who it applies to or who it doesn't apply to.

16

It doesn't apply to people where the last State court

17

decision was made before the Supreme Court made its

18

decision.

19

but you have to cut and draw a line somewhere.

That's it.

Now, that's arbitrary somewhat,

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

I'll

I think, Justice Breyer -What's the problem?

Why is

that complicated?
MR. FISHER:

You're right that there's --

that there's arbitrariness built into any cutoff.
JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. FISHER:

And the State makes this point

in its brief.

4

Griffith, you're going to create a whole new level of

5

arbitrariness that we think is undesirable and

6

unnecessary.

7

But by disjoining habeas law from

So, for example, in a situation like this

8

everything is going to turn on whether a State supreme

9

court grants review and ultimately disposes an issue on

10

the merits.

And many State supreme courts might take

11

the view that, well, hey, if the State supreme court --

12

if the U.S. Supreme Court has just decided this issue

13

and we don't have any new law to make here, this isn't

14

worth our time.

So, we're just going to let it go.

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

But the person would say:

16

Look, the State supreme court has -- you -- we're under

17

a decision here the exact opposite of what the United

18

States Supreme Court held.

19

our case and hear it or at least send it back to the

20

lower court?

21
22

Will you please either take

And wouldn't most State supreme courts do
it?

23

MR. FISHER:

I think many State supreme

24

courts -- I think there's a possible two questions you

25

asked.

One is whether State supreme courts in that
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

situation would themselves GVR back to the immediate

2

court.

3

do that.

4

They don't have to do it.

5

Pennsylvania, by our estimation, doesn't seem to
And many State supreme courts don't do it.

And, again, you have the problem, if you're

6

going to rely on somebody to bring the case up to this

7

Court and say that's the only way that he can get

8

benefit of the new decision, I think this Court -- I

9

know it's counterintuitive, but you're going to have to

10

take a hard look, not just at fairness and equity, but

11

at this Court's right to counsel jurisprudence and ask

12

yourself whether somebody under the Halbert test who has

13

a right to have a decision on the merits of that claim

14

and that's the only time it can be litigated, therefore

15

has to have the right to counsel because he couldn't

16

otherwise navigate the process.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I could reserve --- that, Mr. Fisher, because

MR. FISHER:

Well, there's at least a

backup that -- a backup that doesn't exist today -- or

27

Alderson Reporting Company

And so, the difference it would make would be he would

have a second chance to bring the claim where if he

brought it the district courts often would appoint

counsel.

21

MR. EISENBERG:

Your Honor, as we addressed

22

in our brief at footnote 12, as Petitioner referred, we

review, and the reason for that is really a two-step

process.

Of course, Justice

Sotomayor.

As to those relatively few States that

hypothetically might not, the defendant goes to Federal

16

court, and because this is a Teague exception -- and

17

they are exceptions because they are exceptional -- he

has a number of existing habeas doctrines to rely on:

19

cause and prejudice, actual innocence, inadequate State

20

grounds.

21

case to be able to get through the default of not having

22

had an adjudication in State court, and he'll have not

23

only review in Federal court, but he'll have de novo

24

review in Federal court, because there was no ruling on

25

the merits.

And he is quite likely in the Teague exception

So, not only will he have Federal court

review, but it won't be deferential review in that 


2

circumstance. 

If the State did allow the review of the

Teague exception, then he will have deferential review.

And, in fact, this question has been debate by the Court

5

Yes, Your Honor, and that's

appropriate because, of course, AEDPA wants the State

didn't know that at that time, and the State had a

Abuse of the writ,

Certainly, Congress had the right to do that,

In Williams v. Taylor for example, it was

Justice Stevens's position in dissent, arguing in

dissent, that the statute really only embodied Teague.

13

When the statute said clearly established, all that

14

Congress meant to do was to codify Teague.

15

was perfectly clear that that was the case.

16

argued, particularly in footnote 12 of his dissenting

17

portion of his opinion in Williams v. Taylor, just as

18

Petitioner argues today, that the fact that Congress in

19

other portions of AEDPA, particularly in section 2244,

20

used language talking about finality of judgment and

21

talking about retroactivity -- the fact that Congress

22

did that in 2244 meant that it was thinking about Teague

23

and that it really meant to extend the Teague rule

throughout the entire statute, that Teague really

The Court necessarily rejected that

argument.

And, in fact, in reference to another prior

case of this Court, Wright v. West, that had been argued

by Justice Stevens in his dissent, Justice O'Connor

5

speaking for the Court said Congress need not mention a

6

prior decision of this Court by name in a statute's text

7

in order to adopt a rule.

8

Now, I think that's clearly what Congress

9

did, and I think that the Court clearly recognized in

10

Williams v. Taylor that the deference rule, 2254,

11

constituted a new rule which sat side by side with

12

Teague and operated in different ways, even if in some

13

cases, many cases that would mean you never had to get

14

to the Teague bar, because the 2254 bar came into play

first or more easily.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

23

Let me make three points, starting with the

most important, which is the Teague exceptions we've

25

been talking about.

Now, the State, in its brief in
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

footnote 12 and today, says actual innocence, cause and

2

prejudice, or something, would let you get around the

3

problem that I've raised.

4

because all those doctrines do is allow you to bring the

5

case forward.

6

a situation where you haven't preserved a claim

7

previously.

8
9

But that doesn't work,

They just allow you to get out from under

But this case is all about a situation where
the defendant does everything he is supposed to do,

10

everything he can do, but it just so happens that this

11

Court's decision has come down after the last State

12

court decision on the merits, and the State on

13

collateral review has refused -- if it's been given a

14

chance -- to remedy that.
The three cases I cited to you -- at least

15
16

one of them involves a situation where the defendant did

17

go back to the State -- and I believe it's the Graham

18

case -- and said apply this to me.

19

Virginia said, no, you're barred from State collateral

20

review.

21

The State of

So, all those doctrines do is allow the

22

defendant to get in the door.

Once he's in the door, he

23

still has to satisfy 2254(d)(1), which says that no

24

claim shall be granted -- no -- habeas relief shall not

25

be granted on any claim unless the language we've been
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

talking about today.

So, the only way out of the

2

problem that we,ve phrased is to say that Teague decides

3

what is clearly established law, not the language of the

4

statute itself, under the State's reading of the

5

statute. 

The second thing is, as to this Court's GVR 


6
7

practice, I don't think there is much doubt, in all 


8

fairness --


9

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the claim -- the claim 


10

under Graham is a different claim from any previous claim.

11

Doesn't that get you out from under it?

12

MR. FISHER:

Well, not if the State says

13

that you're barred in its own -- remember, that will get

14

you out from the problem of being able to get in the

15

door, because what would happen in that situation is the

16

State would say this is waived because he didn't make it

17

earlier.

18

the exceptions in AEDPA for new claims and whether

19

actual innocence applies, et cetera.

merely gateways to the question of whether the defendant

21

gets relief, which is controlled by 2254(d).

opinion, you know, for all the reasons in Teague, that

what they did is to time-bar and they wouldn't hear it.

3

mistake.

mistake in not hearing it and deciding it for me.

That State court that wouldn't hear it made a

The decision on

the merits would have been earlier in the proceedings,

review because we've already heard it once.

have the situation we have today, and the only way out

of that situation is to understand that Teague continues

to control what is clearly established law.

Again, it goes

back to the structure of the whole statute, because the

question this Court is supposed to be asking itself is,

22

to think that Congress wanted to dispense with Teague?
