ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN F. HUBACHEK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. HUBACHEK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Nguyen, the Court approved the imposition

12

of legitimation requirement only upon fathers of

13

non-marital children born abroad.

14

biological differences between men and women.

15

provided proof of parentage and proof of an opportunity

16

to make a relationship with the child that adhered in

17

birth as to the mother.

18

That was based on
It

But here, the residential requirements that

19

are at issue here have no biological basis.

20

barriers to the transmission of citizenship by younger

21

fathers, but not younger mothers, and they are based

22

upon gender stereotypes that women, not men, would

23

care -- would care for non-marital children.

24
25

They set up

That scheme has been -- the Solicitor
General has attempted to justify that scheme by claiming

Alderson Reporting Company

that Congress was concerned about statelessness, but the

2

record doesn't support that claim.

Review article -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Both the 1935 Law

What separates a stereotype

5

from a reality?

6

is a legitimate -- illegitimate child, it is much more

7

likely that the woman will end up caring for it than

8

that the father would?

9

Do you say it is not true that if there

MR. HUBACHEK:

What I was saying -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. HUBACHEK:

That's not true?
I think it is more likely,

12

but I think that empirical evidence has not carried the

13

day in gender discrimination cases.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In all cases, it is true

15

in general, but there are people who don't fit the mold.

16

So a stereotype is true for maybe the majority of cases.

17

It just means that you say:

18

this is the way men are.

19

MR. HUBACHEK:

This is the way women are,

Absolutely, and this is

20

actually beyond just an empirical stereotype.

21

congressional hearings, it was said that the woman is

22

the sole legal parent of this child, totally excluding

23

the man, which basically dates back to the notion of

24

coverture where men were completely out of the picture

25

and women were the ones who were responsible.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

The -- at

So in addition to the fact that -- the

2

empirical portion of it, there is also just the notion

3

that the legal parent was the woman.

4

specifically -
JUSTICE ALITO:

5

And that was

Wasn't that said in relation

6

to the principle that only -- that where paternity was

7

not established, the child would be regarded as having

8

the citizenship of the mother under the law of virtually

9

every country, if not every country, at that time?
MR. HUBACHEK:

10

Well, the law of many

11

countries was that citizenship did go through the

12

mother.

13

statute, Congress drew a distinction between all -- all

14

parents of -- excuse me, all fathers of non-marital

15

children and those who are legitimate.

16

applies only to those who are legitimate.

But with respect to legitimation and this

This statute

17

The very Law Review article that Congress

18

relied upon, according to the Solicitor General, says

19

that in the case of legitimation, citizenship goes

20

through the father.

21

very -- the very article they relied upon said that in

22

one instance it goes through the mother, but in the

23

instance of the people who are actually affected through

24

this statute, those who legitimate, it goes through the

25

father.

So the bottom line is that the

And there are also a number of situations
under which mothers -
JUSTICE ALITO:

3

Until there is legitimation,

4

it goes through the mother.

5

under the law in virtually every country, right?
MR. HUBACHEK:

6

It went through the mother

I respectfully disagree.

At

7

the time, in 1940, when this statute was passed, there

8

were a number of situations where it wouldn't go through

9

the mother.

10
11

In China and Japan, if the father was

merely known it would not go through the mother.
There were three dozen countries at this

12

time, including the English countries and those who

13

followed its law, in which if their female citizen gave

14

birth to a child somewhere other than in their country,

15

citizenship would not travel through that mother because

16

of the laws of those particular countries.

17

also stateless women.

18

There are

So in all those situations, the citizenship

19

would not go through the mother.

20

through the father, and this statutory scheme doesn't in

21

any way provide for that.

22

It would have to go

The scheme also creates severe risks of

23

statelessness, as is set out in the Statelessness

24

Scholar's brief, for married fathers.

4

United States, that child would end up stateless as

5

well.

it continues today.

So if the

There are numerous countries that have

8

basically reinstituted that rule, that if the father is

9

merely known, citizenship would not transmit through the

10

mother.

some of them in Africa, and those are detailed in the

12

Statelessness Scholars' brief.

13

And those are primarily in the Middle East and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Hubachek, how do you

14

deal with the argument that, really, this is a

15

classification where the unmarried woman is being

16

favored, because the unmarried father is being bracketed

17

with the married couple?

18

Matthews v. Heckler:

19

favor and the unwed father is treated like most people

20

who married -- couples who have children.

21

So it's kind of like

The woman is getting a special

MR. HUBACHEK:

This is not a case where

22

Congress was seeking to remedy any sort of past

23

discrimination against women, as was the case, say, in

24

Schlesinger v. Ballard.

25

against women.

There was no discrimination

Up until very shortly before this
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

statute was passed, it was clear under the State

2

Department practices that the non-marital children of

3

women did get women's citizenship, and it was also true

as to men.

5

being remedied in that situation.

So there was no discrimination that was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

But that doesn't answer,

7

I don't think, Justice Ginsberg's question, which is:

This appears to be an exception to a generalized

9

non-gender based requirement.

Couples, male or female,

10

and fathers, unmarried fathers, are subject to five

13

to the broader category rather than extending a largesse

14

to a greater number of people?

Only unmarried mothers get the largesse of one
Why isn't -- why shouldn't everybody just be put

MR. HUBACHEK:

The reason is, Justice

getting.

litigation -- 1940 legislation.

20

significance residence requirement.

21

That was the standard prior to the 1940
There was no

Then Congress imposed new residence

22

requirements because it was concerned about the foreign

23

influence in mixed marriages, meaning someone who was

24

married to an alien.

25

specifically said in the record that they were concerned

In those situations, Congress

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that when those children were born abroad, that they

2

would have foreign influence, that they would be more

3

foreign then they were American.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's not -
So doesn't the 5-year

5

residency requirement address that?

6

generally, wouldn't the 5-year residency requirement

7

honor Congress's concern about there being a substantial

8

tie to the States?

9

MR. HUBACHEK:

If we apply it

Absolutely, it would.

And

10

that -- for -- that concern is not applicable when you

11

are talking about two U.S. citizen parents to whom the

12

extended residence requirement didn't apply.

13

Non-marital mothers were assumed to be the ones who were

14

going to be raising the children without the influence

15

of an alien father.

16

The non-marital fathers are in the same

17

category as those, too.

18

raise their children on their own, as Petitioner's

19

father did in this case, are not subject to that type of

20

foreign influence, so they should be grouped together

21

with the women and with the two-citizen families,

22

because they have the lack of foreign influence.

23

Those non-marital fathers who

So it's only as to the mixed-marriage

24

couples who are married where there is a foreign

25

influence problem, and they're the ones to whom the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

expanded residence required -- was applied.
Now, with respect to the -- the Solicitor

2
3

General has raised concerns about the plenary power

4

doctrine.

5

here for a couple of reasons.

6
7
8
9

And I would argue that that doesn't apply

First is, we are not talking about the
admission of aliens.
Second is that the Court in Chadha Zadvydas
said -- made clear that even when exercising that power,

10

that congressional -- excuse me -- Congress's power is

11

limited by constitutional limitations.

12

Now, with respect to the entry of aliens,

13

Congress made it very clear in passing this very statute

14

that they considered those people who gained citizenship

15

as of birth to be differently situated than aliens.

16

That was a tradition that dated back to 1350.

17

Congress passed a statute saying that children born

18

abroad to citizens -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In 1790,

Is -- is this your -- are

20

you taking this in the direction of an argument that

21

Congress gets less deference in determining nationality

22

than it does with admission to aliens?

23

MR. HUBACHEK:

What I'm saying, Your Honor,

24

is that we are talking about the ability of a United

25

States citizen, Petitioner's father, to transmit
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

citizenship, and that that is a traditional interest.

2

Citizenship is extremely important and it's a tradition

3

that citizens have been able to do for years.
So yes, constitutional limitations should

4
5

apply when the -- when Congress is drawing distinctions

6

between men and women -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

But you -- you want us to

8

write an opinion that says Congress has less deference

9

when it considering -- when it determines who should be

10

a national of this country than it -- than when it

11

determines who should be admitted as an alien?
MR. HUBACHEK:

12

Well, there is no tradition

13

dating back to 1350 for the admission of aliens.

14

It's -- it's -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15
16

Are you asking us to write

that formulation in an opinion?
MR. HUBACHEK:

17

Your Honor, what I'm saying

18

is that the -- that the due process guarantee of equal

19

protection is applicable in this context because the

20

citizens of the United States -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

If I -- if I take that as

22

a "yes" answer, what is your authority for that answer?

23

It seems to me that it ought to be just the other way

24

around.

25

MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, Your Honor, my
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority for that answer is the tradition that I have

2

been discussing.

3

people who gained citizenship by birth abroad as being

4

differently situated from aliens, aliens who naturalize.

5

In fact, they said that that was universally -

Congress itself, in 1940, considered

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

Of course, but it was

7

Congress that made the distinction.

8

us to say that Congress has less authority over this

9

essential issue as to who should be nationals in the

10

United States.
MR. HUBACHEK:

11
12
13

But you are asking

Well, I think -- that's -

that's a -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Maybe there is some

14

authority for that.

15

there something I can read that tells me that?

Do you have any authority?

Now suppose they are not married and the

MR. HUBACHEK:

7

Now 2 years.
There are a couple of reasons

8

at least for that, Your Honor.

First is that there is a

9

structural limitation here to imposing a levelling-down

10

type remedy, because citizenship cannot be taken away

11

once it's granted.

12

problem here -

So the Court can't remedy the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Some people were lucky, and

15

because their mother lived in the United States for one

16

Those already are citizens.

Nobody is going to

We are just looking at a statute.

And in the first part of the statute, they

third rule.

In 1409(a), the second rule, and in 1409(c), the

Okay.

22

If you are right about this, and it's

23

totally unfair and there is no good reason whatsoever

24

for distinguishing on the basis of gender, we strike

25

(g).

Okay?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Now, that would seem to be normal, but that

2

isn't going to help your client.

So how do you get to

3

some other thing that instead of striking (g)?

4

do is strike all of (a) and strike the whole thing

5

before, and shove them all into (g), which isn't so easy

6

to do with this language.

7

MR. HUBACHEK:

What we

How do you get there?

8

that this statute contains a severability clause.

What I'm worried about is, you want me to strike (a) -

And -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

First, can we be clear

19

about what you're saying?

I thought your argument was,

20

you are not touching married couples.

21

MR. HUBACHEK:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct.
So that you are talking

23

about equating the unmarried father to the unmarried

24

mother.

25

people we're talking about?

Do you have -- is there any notion of how many

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I mean, in these extensions versus the

2

normalization, where the Court generally extends when

3

there is a small class to be covered, a small class was

4

left out, and in a large class is already covered.

5

the reasoning has been:

6

wanted to take care of that larger class; it would be

7

most destructive of the legislative will if we said you

8

can't cover that larger class.

And

Well, my goodness, Congress

So as a group of unmarried mothers as

9
10

against unmarried fathers, do -- do you have any notion

11

of what the numbers would be?
MR. HUBACHEK:

Justice Ginsberg, I don't

have any statistics to provide the Court.

maybe you would like to answer Justice Breyer's

16

question.

17

MR. HUBACHEK:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

Anyway,

18

the remedy we are requesting is extension.

19

and in Heckler, the Court looked at language in the

20

severability clause that was similar to this, and also

21

in Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Welsh, and

22

said that type of language in a severability clause

gives courts power to grant an extension remedy.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, there's another slight

2

problem with that, I would think.

Reading this

3

carefully, which I hope I have done, it seems to me it

4

may also discriminate against fathers.

5

because (c) says that the woman has to have been

6

physically present for a continuous period of one year.

7

I read at least one article that says that word,

8

"continuous," doesn't appear with the fathers, and that

9

they really mean it.

And that's

That is, if somebody is living

10

down in Texas and they happen to go visit on Christmas

11

their father, who is -- or their grandmother or cousin

12

or something who is across the border for 5 minutes,

13

that they cannot take advantage of this clause (c).

14

Is that true?

15

MR. HUBACHEK:

16
17

I don't know the answer to

that, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I will ask the (g) that,

18

but if it is true -- if it is true, then -- then I would

19

think that the fathers are really worse off.

20

know if that helps you.

21

that that's really a problem.

22
23
24
25

I don't

And maybe it could turn out

If it is really a problem, then the fathers
are worse off.

Does that help you with the remedy?

MR. HUBACHEK:

Traditionally in immigration

law when you have continuous requirements, if it's a
17
Alderson Reporting Company

1

short trip, casual trip, you know, then those -- that

2

requirement is not considered to have been violated.
If the -- if -- I have to admit I'm having a

3
4

hard time following the question.
JUSTICE BREYER:

5

The question is:

I'm

6

looking for a way -- I'm trying to be helpful in my

7

question.

your result.

9

just want to know what the best way is of getting to

I'm looking for a way that you can get to
Now I'm not saying I would do it, but I

10

that result, where you shove everyone into (c) instead

11

of just cutting (c).

12

MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, the -- the best way is

13

to follow the Court's tradition in the benefits cases

14

such as Wengler and Wiesenfeld, where the Court granted

15

an extension remedy and basically treated -

16
17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That would help you.

Is

there a reason for doing that?
MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, the reason for doing

19

that is, is that the language that's contained in the

20

severability clause is similar to what the Court has

21

already said allows an extension remedy.

22

problem is, is that if the Court doesn't grant an

23

extension remedy, it leaves Petitioner basically without

24

a remedy, that there will be individuals who have been

That's all of the relief he is entitled to.
MR. HUBACHEK:

9

You are absolutely right,

10

that that is -- that is the state of the law.

And my

11

point is that structurally, that remedy is unavailable

here, because you can't take away the citizenship from

13

the people who have already gotten it.

14

And the notion that you can grant us

15

prospective relief as discussed in the Solicitor

16

General's brief doesn't make any sense, either, because

17

number one, this statute, the one we are talking about

18

today, doesn't apply past people who were born before

19

1986.

20

But the thing is that if somebody were to

21

come into court after an opinion that said just that

22

were issued -- someone were to come into court and say,

23

I want to claim citizenship through my mother, that

24

person would still be entitled to citizenship because

25

it's as of the day of birth.

So this is a retroactive

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

provision.
So the prospective relief notion really

3

doesn't makes any sense in this context, because the

4

equal protection violations have basically all already

5

occurred at the time that the person who would make a

6

citizenship claim was born, and we would still be left

7

in a situation where Petitioner's father would say that

8

I was unable to transmit citizenship to my son and a

9

woman who was similarly situated was able to.

10
11

So that

type of remedy is unavailable.
In the Court's decision in Iowa v. Bennett,

12

the bank case, they actually ordered a refund of the

13

taxes that were collected in a discriminatory manner

14

dating back in time.

15

you could make a relief that would take away the benefit

16

that others had received, then I would agree that that

17

is available, but that's not possible in this situation.

18

So if you could factor out -- if

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Hubachek, I think the

19

Chief asked you:

If it's an equal protection violation,

20

then the Court just says it violates equal protection,

21

but whether it goes up or down, the Court has to give a

22

temporary solution, because the legislature can't be

23

convened on the spot.

24

through that exercise, extension versus invalidation,

25

most conspicuously in Califano -- Westcott, in the

And the Court actually did go

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Westcott case.

It says, yes, that's what we have been

2

doing in all these cases.
In Sarah Frontiero's case, we didn't say:

3
4

You've been discriminated against; Congress, you fix it.

5

We said:

6

now has been available only in male officers.

7

benefits as the mother.

9

decision for extension; it recognized it had to do that.

You get the quarters' allowance that up until

So the Court was making a

MR. HUBACHEK:

10

And in

Absolutely.

And in many of

11

the benefits cases, the same -- the same analysis was

12

available and that's the analysis that we are asking

13

that the Court apply here.

But we're also making -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Mr. Hubacheck, you are

15

asking, I think, that the Court pronounce your client to

16

be a United States citizen.

17

pronouncement from -- form the Court that is going to do

18

your client any good?

19

MR. HUBACHEK:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21
22

Isn't that the only

Well, Justice Scalia -
Unless he's a United States

citizen.
MR. HUBACHEK:

This is a criminal case, so

23

technically what we are asking is for a reversal of the

24

judgment and opportunity to present this -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A reversal of the judgment

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on the grounds that your client is a United States

2

citizen, right?
MR. HUBACHEK:

3

That it would be possible for

4

him, on these facts, to become a United States citizen,

5

yes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6
7

States citizen.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

That he is a United

that he is.

That he is.

That he is, not that -

Do you have any other case

10

where a Court has conferred citizenship on someone who,

11

under the statutes as written, does not have it?
MR. HUBACHEK:

12

Well, that was one of the

13

issues that was debated, of course, in the Nguyen and

14

Miller cases, and the Court has not said that yet but it

15

can in this case.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. HUBACHEK:

Never done.
That's correct.

That's

18

correct, but it can in this case, for a number of

19

reasons.

20

clause is applicable to this claim.

21

passed a statute, 1421(d), in this same statutory

22

scheme, that said when we are talking about

23

naturalization -- the naturalization of aliens, then you

24

cannot get naturalization under those circumstances any

25

other way then what's set out in this statute.

Number one is the fact that this severability

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Congress actually

They

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

didn't say that as to claims of citizenship as of birth.
So there is a negative implication,

2
3

basically, that they -- that they were not precluding

4

this type of remedy as to a citizenship claim where we

5

are claiming an equal protection violation.
The second point is that if the Court is

6
7

unable to grant that remedy, that would leave an equal

8

protection violation in place, and as Justice Harlan

9

made clear in Welsh -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Unless -- unless we -- we

11

solve the violation the other way, by saying that the

12

father gets the shorter period that the -- than the

13

mother has.

14

MR. HUBACHEK:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

19

I'm sorry, that the mother

gets the longer period than the father has.
MR. HUBACHEK:

17
18

Well, again -

Right.

And I think if the

Court -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You say we can't apply that

20

retroactively.

Well, okay; we don't apply it

21

retroactively.

The people that have citizenship cannot

22

constitutionally be deprived of it, but for everybody

23

else, it's okay.

24
25

MR. HUBACHEK:

Even -- even prospectively,

Your Honor, because this statute says you have
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

citizenship as of birth.

2

render that decision and someone were to make a claim,

3

they could still say:

4

i.e., whenever I was born, which is before the Court's

5

decision.

6

all.

7

So even if the Court were to

I had citizenship of as of birth;

So there really -- that would be no remedy at

It's a remedy -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But any of -- of the

8

remedies that you are discussing with Justice Scalia

9

involves this Court in a highly intrusive exercise of

10
11

the congressional power.
Let me just ask you this as an analytic

12

matter, or as matter of logical priorities.

13

talk about substance first, remedy second.

14

it's permissible, logically, for us to say that because

15

the remedies here are so intrusive, that bears on our

16

choice of whether we or not we use intermediate or

17

rational basis scrutiny, and because the remedies are so

18

difficult, we are going to use rational basis scrutiny?

19

Is that a logical way to proceed?

20

MR. HUBACHEK:

We usually
Do you think

I don't think so.

I think

21

the Court has traditionally has said that the -- the

22

questions of a right and whether or not there exists an

23

opportunity to make a claim and the remedy for it are

24

analytically distinct.

25

So I don't believe -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it also said that the

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

remedy can't be complicated, because courts are not set

2

up to do that.

3

court can go one way or another way; it can't do any

4

fine-tuning, because it's there as a temporary

5

legislature.

6

it will, but it's just, in the interim, we need a

7

solution.

The

The ball goes back to Congress to do what

MR. HUBACHEK:

8
9

I mean, that's what Westcott said.

Congress could do that.

That's correct, and certainly
And the Solicitor General's

10

brief makes clear that what was being balanced here was

11

concerns about --

12

about statelessness on the one hand and connection to

13

the United States on the other.

according to them, anyway -- concerns

14

If Congress hadn't assumed based on gender

15

stereotypes that men weren't caring for children, then

16

it would have -- it would have been able to put them in

17

the same category as women, because they would

18

understand that both of them would be caring for

19

children.
And it's not just the -- the situation in

20
21

1940.

As time has gone on, I believe in the National

22

Women's Center brief it points out that the number of

23

men who are raising children in single-parent families

24

is increasing over time.

25

is getting worse.

So the problem, if anything,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Congress did make at

2

least some change, right?

It -- this is -- it's no

3

longer five years; it's only two years, right?
MR. HUBACHEK:

4

The current system is five

5

years, two years after the -- the age of 16 -- I'm

6

sorry, after the age of 14.

7

requirement here completely precluded

8

Mr. Flores-Villar's father from being able to transmit

9

citizenship because of his age.

And of course, that age

That kind of complete

preclusion would never apply to a woman who is similarly

20

Thank you, Counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress in deciding who among the various

21

people born abroad should be made citizens of the United

22

States has to take into account myriad factors that may

23

bear on that question and its judgment.

24

importantly Congress's prediction in the case of

25

conferring citizenship at birth, what would be that
26
Alderson Reporting Company

They include

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

person's likely connection to the United States.

2

Congress also has to consider the interaction with the

3

laws of other countries where these people may be born.

4

It may take into account equities, potential

5

statelessness or dual nationality.

6

complicated questions to which the courts should defer.

7

Now, in the particular -

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

These are

Intermediate scrutiny

and -- is not without some deference.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Excuse me.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Unless we apply strict

12

scrutiny, which no one is arguing for, the question is,

13

is it rational basis deference or is it some

14

intermediate scrutiny, correct?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

And we believe that

16

under this Court's decisions, particularly in Fiallo v.

17

Bell and the cases discussed in that case, that it

18

should be rational basis for -

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but you can't

20

really mean that because we can put up a hypothetical

21

that is very simple and then you'll explain to me why a

22

U.S. citizen should be burdened in this way and the

23

hypothetical is, let's assume Congress determines that

24

there are too many foreign-born children of U.S.

25

citizens coming into the United States, and that those
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

foreign-born children, those born of women are placing a

2

greater burden on our economic system.

3

care for reasons that Congress determines analytically

4

or statistically.

They are spending more money -- more

5

government money.

And Congress passes a rule that says,

6

only the foreign-born children of men can come into the

7

country, not of women.

8

basis?

Wouldn't that be a rational

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

They need more

I think the answer to that

10

question lies in the Court's formulation of the test

11

that is applied in this particular context, and that is

12

the formulation drawn from Kleindienst v. Mandel that

13

was articulated in Fiallo v. Bell, and that is that

14

there has to be a facially legitimate and bona fide

15

reason.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16
17

There is a facially

legitimate bona fide reason.
MR. KNEEDLER:

18

I think the Court could have

19

no trouble concluding that an arbitrary choice between

20

men and women -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

What's arbitrary about a

22

government saying, I want to spend less money on a new

23

citizen?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

The -- the ultimate reason

may be legitimate, but I think the facial legitimate
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

test also encompasses means not just end, and if

2

Congress is just arbitrarily choosing between men and

3

women or people of a different race, I think given this

4

Court's tradition it could conclude that those would be

5

impermissible bases under the well-established test, but

6

for the reasons we say in our brief we don't -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7
8

test?
MR. KNEEDLER:

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is that the rational

basis plus test you are talking about?
MR. KNEEDLER:

13
14

Fiallo v. Bell for -- and the

cases underlying it and we also think -

11
12

What well established

You could call it that or you

could call it a facially legitimate -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

So now we're going to

16

just continue sort of tweaking the definitions and

17

creating more variations on our review standard?
MR. KNEEDLER:

18

I think it is -- it is a test

19

that this Court has articulated in Fiallo v. Bell and

20

Kleindienst v. Mandel to address this very situation,

21

including a situation where asserted constitutional

22

rights of U.S. citizens in this country are being

23

claimed.

24

standard should not be more demanding, but rather if

25

anything it should be less demanding where the question

And we agree with Justice Kennedy that the

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

is whether someone should be made a citizen.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's hard here because

3

both the father -- this father, but many fathers and

4

mothers are actually U.S. citizens who want to bring

5

their children over as U.S. citizens.

6

was making the claim here, you would still argue it was

7

a rational basis test even though he's a U.S. citizen

8

and entitled to all the protections of the Constitution?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

So, if the father

We would argue for the

10

facially legitimate -- and that was the case in Fiallo,

11

in which the plaintiffs included U.S. citizens, children

12

and fathers, claiming that, in a very parallel situation

13

claiming that that special privileges for illegitimate

14

children to reunite with the mother worked an

15

unconstitutional discrimination against the fathers of

16

such children.

17

children who were among the plaintiffs and the Court

18

nonetheless said that this is -- there is no

19

constitutional right to pass citizenship, this is a

20

question of Congress's judgment about who it believes

21

should be made citizens.

22

factors Congress has looked at is connection to a U.S.

23

citizen that is in turn a proxy for what the likely

24

connection to the United States will be.

25

And it was U.S. citizen fathers and

And one of the important

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand that, but what

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you are doing is applying a lesser standard to gender

2

discrimination than is ordinarily applied to gender

3

discrimination.

4

think that was the thrust of the question.

Now, is there any reason to do that?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In Fiallo v. Bell.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

If it's the government's

9

I

Well, that was the issue.
Now fine.

position you do, does the same thing apply to racial

10

discrimination?

Do you also apply a lesser standard to

11

racial discrimination?
MR. KNEEDLER:

12

I think the facially

13

legitimate standard in Fiallo v. Bell would render a

14

reliance on race.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

a big hole in the Fourteenth Amendment.
MR. KNEEDLER:

17

This is suddenly is cutting

No, I don't think so because

18

I think that same principle would be given effect in the

19

way -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

First, in Fiallo we were

21

dealing not with citizens, this is someone, a

22

resident -- could be a resident alien wanting to bring

23

in a parent or a child.

24

wasn't about who was the citizen at birth.

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

So it wasn't -- that case

It wasn't, but in the eyes of
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Constitution, anyone born abroad is an alien unless

2

and until Congress has passed a statute making them a

3

citizen.

4

question.

So analytically, doctrinally it is the same

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

Congress has passed -

6

has passed a statute making certain people citizens and

7

the question is, has it done so in a way that is

8

compatible with equal protection.

9

because it's not in the front of my head, I thought that

But remind me too,

10

classification that was dealt with in Fiallo, wasn't it

11

unwed parentage rather than gender?
MR. KNEEDLER:

12

But there were claims based

13

on both illegitimacy and gender and there were equal

14

protection claims based on both.

15

to the way that the statute operates because we think it

16

satisfies either standard of review in this case.

17

if I could just step back for a moment.

18

there are a number of factors that Congress takes into

19

account in crafting a statute like this.

20

with married couples and where both parents are

21

citizens, all that is required is that one of the

22

parents have resided in the United States prior to the

23

birth.

But if I could move on

As I mentioned,

1401 deals

24

Where you have mixed parentage, the

25

background of the enactment of this in 1940 and
32
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reenactment in 1952 and continued up to this present day

2

is Congress was concerned that such a child may not have

3

the requisite connection to the United States.

4

have a connection to the parent, but may not have a

5

connection to the United States such that Congress

6

wanted to grant citizenship to that person.

7

Congress did in the mixed citizenship situation was to

8

require prior residency of the parent as a talisman, as

9

the Court said in Rogers v. Bellei, for a connection to

They

So what

12

basic thought.

13

what Congress did was to follow general principles of

14

the law of illegitimacy or children born out of wedlock,

15

if a father legitimates a child then it's as if the

16

child was born in a marriage, and the rule in 1401 with

17

respect to marriage applies.

18

parents are citizens or in a mixed marriage situation.

19

If a father legitimates a child and both parents are

20

citizens, then not the one, then the child benefits from

21

the rule that if either parent was present in the United

22

States before birth he's a citizen, doesn't have to

23

satisfy the one year unbroken residency requirement

24

under 1409(c).

25

legitimates, then the rule applicable to married mixed

Congress has liberalized that, but that was the

That is true whether both

4

has been done.

5

mother of the child born out of wedlock where there has

7

the basis of a one year residency.

8

the Petitioner explains, a mother in that situation who

9

at the moment of birth, as this Court understood in

It's a perfectly sensible and

What Congress did with respect to the

Now, as counsel for

10

Nguyen, that mother may be the only either legal parent

11

or the only parent at the moment of birth with the

12

requisite connection to the child to have an opportunity

13

for this sort of connection at birth.

14

that circumstance is very much like the two citizen

15

parent family, the only parents are parents with a

16

connection to the United States.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the mother in

Mr. Kneedler, if -- if

18

the classification then were that we want to encourage,

19

because it's good for society, father/child

20

relationships, so we are going to give that advantage,

21

that is 1 year for fathers, and we're going to put the

22

mothers together with the married couples, would that be

23

compatible with equal protection?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think that would

be -- that would depend upon a -- a -- a different
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

rationale.

I mean here what Congress -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I told you what the

3

rationale was.

The rationale was that we have lots of

4

statutes like the Family Medical and Leave Act that

5

attempt to encourage fathers to have a relationship with

6

their children, to be a legal parent, so that's the

7

rationale of this classification.

8

encourage the father/child relationship, therefore, they

9

gave this 1 year is enough for the -- for the father.

They want to

10

And everything else is the same, except it's the father

11

who gets the 1 year, and the mother who gets the -- what

12

is it, 10 years -

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that would be a more

14

difficult question, because Congress would be -- would

15

be responding based on the -- on the expected behaviors

16

and talents maybe of men and women.

17

here is that's not what it's -- that's not the basis for

18

this classification.

19

What's different

This -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it would you, in

20

fact, acting on the basis of what hasn't been the

21

general pattern but what is becoming the new pattern.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

And in that

23

situation, Congress I think could be expected and maybe

24

should be required to do that in a gender-neutral basis

25

because it is premising it on the behavior, but -- but
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

So there is, even though

3

we are still dealing with citizenship, you recognize

4

that there are categorizations that would run afoul of

5

equal protection?
MR. KNEEDLER:

6

Well, that -- and -- and the

7

question would be whether that's a facially legitimate

8

rationale.

9

would want to know more about what the record for such a

And -- and I would want to know -- I think I

10

justification would be, et cetera.

11

like to -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I -- but I would

The same as in the Family

13

Medical Leave Act, we are making it a parental leave

14

instead as if it had been historically a maternity.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

And in -- in that

16

situation, I think it would be expanding on a

17

gender-neutral basis rather than singling out one parent

18

or the other.

19

description, I have because it's incomplete and there is

20

a critical piece left out, and that is that counsel for

21

Petitioner says that if -- if a father legitimates an

22

out-of-wedlock child, he is in the same position or that

23

child is in the same position as a child in an

24

out-of-wedlock mother, and that is not likely to be so,

25

and it's not likely to be so at birth.

two parents who have the strong connection that was

described in this Court's decision in Nguyen to that

alien mother in that country.

whose interests have to be taken into account.

So you have two parents

Whereas in the situation Congress was

to the illegitimacy -- the cases involving illegitimates

that is instructive.

question was whether the father of a child born out of

MR. KNEEDLER:

Congress -- Congress

2

selected, because while I said the mothers are like the

3

two-citizen family or two-citizen parents in the sense

4

that only U.S. citizens are the parent and you have some

5

connection, Congress was balancing the duration of that

6

connection or taking into account the duration of that

7

connection and it chose to make it a little bit tougher.

8

And I -- I think that is perfectly legitimate, because

9

Congress -- because you only have one parent and

10

Congress was deciding, well if somebody has been here

11

for a continuous period of 1 year, then there -- then

12

there is probably a greater likelihood that that person

13

will -- will have roots here then, for example, the

14

other situation where if you had a child born abroad and

15

came home in the summers, that child may not think of

16

himself or may not be regarded as an American in the

17

same way.

18

So, what Congress was focusing on a -- on a

19

period of longer duration, which in its judgment

20

could -- could give rise to, Congress believed, a

21

greater connection to the United States.

The person where he would get relief is if

That's it.

The relief this person is asking for is not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kneedler, in

24

answering the question that way, I know you are familiar

with the Wiesenfeld, case, and the question was, this
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was a father who was denied benefits to take care of a

2

-- a child whose mother died at childbirth.

3

Court came out a unanimous judgment but split three ways

4

on why.

5

is discrimination against the child, even though the

6

classification was -- it's called a mother's benefit -

7

it's discrimination against the child because it should

8

make no difference at all whether the missing parent is

9

female or male, that that was utterly irrational.

And the

And one of the members of the Court said, this

That was the Chief -- that was then Justice

10
11

Rehnquist's concurring opinion in Wiesenfeld.

12

seemed to think that the discrimination was against the

13

child and that that counted for equal protection

14

purposes.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

So he

Well, here the only claim

16

that has been raised is an equal protection violation of

17

the parent's asserted rights.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that's what --

19

Steven Wiesenfeld, the father was the plaintiff, but the

20

Court -- at least one justice's rationale was that the

21

discrimination is really against the child, but the

22

father can raise him -

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, insofar as any claim of

24

discrimination by the child, I think, since it's not

25

based on the child's gender, I think that would clearly
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be a rational basis or facially legitimate standard; and

2

Justice O'Connor's opinion in Miller v. Albright

3

addressed the rational basis there.

4

And here, this is not just based on the

5

gender of the parent, it's based on the -- on the

6

complexities in the legal history with respect to

7

illegitimacy, and -- and how children born out of

8

wedlock are dealt with, which again turns not on -- on

9

stereotypes of behavior or talents, but on longstanding

10

legal regimes not just in this country but in -- in

11

other countries, that until the father does something to

12

have a meaningful relationship, the mother is the -- is

13

the only legal parent, or in the terminology of this

14

Court's decision in Nguyen, the parent who is likely to

15

have the meaningful relationship.

16

Once the father comes forward in a case like

17

Lehr, the result is not that the father gets a veto

18

power or that that only the father's interests are taken

19

into account; the answer is that you have two parents

20

whose interests are taken into -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's a case where

And you said something

about -- this has nothing to do with stereotypes, this

is the way the law was?

5

because of the vision of the world of being divided into

6

married couples, where the father is what counted, and

7

unwed mothers, where she was -- they say both father and

8

mother, because the law didn't regard him as having any

9

kind of obligation?
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

But wasn't the law shaped

Well, again, I think this is

11

the issue the Court addressed in Nguyen, in which the

12

Court -- the Court said that there is -- there is a

13

difference at the moment of birth in the potential and

14

therefore the likelihood of a -- of a connection of

15

child to parent at the moment of birth that justified

16

the requirement that -- that the father take a step to

17

legitimate the child, in order to be able to -- to be on

18

an equal footing with the mother with respect to -- to

19

the rights.

20

And here the residency requirement is what

21

measures the connection of the parent to the United

22

States, not the child to the parent; but we think the

23

same point obtains, that at the moment of birth in

24

another country, for example, another country might take

25

a view that this Court did in Nguyen and Lehr and cases
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

like that, that the father doesn't have a meaningful

2

connection to the child in the sense that one would

3

predict citizenship on the basis of, until there had

4

been some formal steps which would happen after birth to

5

establish the relationship with the child.

6

constitutional for Congress to do that in Nguyen, it is

7

constitutional for Congress to take into account that

8

other countries might do the very same thing.

done those steps, then you have a U.S. citizen mother

and a father in another country that is directly

3

parallel to the married mixed -- mixed parent marriage;

4

and Congress was concerned about whether that child was

5

going to be sufficiently affiliated with the United

6

States to justify a conferral of citizenship.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

Counsel, if we

8

determine that the only remedy we can impose is to

9

equalize up -- in other words, add to the burden on the

mother rather than relieving the father of it, do you

The rationale that the Solicitor General's

made that even after men do the things that the Court

said were legitimately required of them, that they

4

legitimate, that they have an opportunity to form a

5

relationship with their child, that further gender-based

6

assumptions should be put into place and say that, well,

7

but you are not going to be the real father or you're

8

not going to be the real parent.

9

women we are going to assume that when they had have the

10

nonmarital child they are going to be in charge and that

11

when a father legitimates and does whatever is required

12

wherever the child is born, we are going to assume that

13

the mother is involved still.

14

this case demonstrate that that's not the case.
