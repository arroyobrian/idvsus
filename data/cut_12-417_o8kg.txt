 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Our second case is 

Case 12417, Sandifer v. United States Steel. 

5

 Mr. Schnapper? 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

8

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

9

it please the Court: 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 We agree with the government that not 

11

everything an individual wears is clothes.  We disagree 

12

with the government as to the appropriate standard for 

13

distinguishing things that are and are not clothes under 

14

Section 203(o). 

15

 I'd like to begin with the area we're  in 

16

which we are in agreement with the government, although 

17

not with Respondent.  In ordinary parlance, not 

18

everything an individual wears would be referred to as 

19

clothes. 

20

 There are examples of that in this 

21

courtroom:  Glasses, necklaces, earrings, wristwatches. 

22

There may be a toupee, for all we know.  Those things 

23

are not commonly referred to as clothes. 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

 (Laughter.)

I resent that. 

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

And nor are neck braces, 

2

which I've seen worn in this courtroom.  It's also the 

3

case that there are any number of things that people 

4

wear to do their jobs that are not clothes.  The police 

5

officers outside the building are wearing guns, radios. 

6

 I suspect they have handcuffs; I couldn't 

7

see those.  The quarterback who played for your team 

8

yesterday had a quarterback playbook wristband with the 

9

plays on  on his  on his wrist. 

10

 Workers wear tool belts. 

It's  one of the 

11

recurring  recurring issues that has come up in these 

12

cases are knife scabbards.  We don't think anyone would, 

13

in ordinary parlance, call those things clothes.  And we 

14

think that's the significant limitation on this. 

15

 The  the company's account of this is that 

16

everything that you wear to do your job is  is 

17

clothes, and we think that's just not consistent with 

18

ordinary language.  And although the government's views 

19

have, to some extent, evolved over time in all of this, 

20

they've always taken the position that not everything 

21

you wear are clothes. 

22

 Even in its  in the 2002 opinion letter, 

23

they drew the line at tools and scabbards.  And so even 

24

though you could be wearing those things, those are not 

25

clothes.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But we're dealing with 

here, from the picture, that looks like clothes to me. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Your Honor, I think that 

10

your question raises an excellent point.  One of the 

11

problems with the picture is that it withholds from you 

12

other information that you would use to assess whether 

13

to describe it as clothes.  You don't know what 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Except you would look and 

15

say, those clothes probably have something special 

16

underneath them.  I mean, in ordinary parlance I think 

17

that would be a proper use of diction. 

18

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

If you saw an airbag jacket, 

19

you would probably call it clothes, unless you are an 

20

equestrian.  It looks like a jacket.  If you saw a 

21

compression torsion  a torso compression bandage, in a 

22

photograph, you would call it clothes because you don't 

23

have all the relevant information. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, why is it that the 

jacket and the pants in that picture are not clothes?

5

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

In our view  well, let 

2

me  part of it  well, first of all, they are 

3

designed for a protective function, to protect you from 

4

catching fire. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, this is one of the 

6

aspects of your argument that seems really puzzling to 

7

me.  I don't know when  when a human being first got 

8

the idea of putting on clothing.  I think it was one of 

9

the main reasons  probably the main reason was for 

10

protection.  It's for protection against the cold.  It's 

11

for protection against the sun.  It's for protection 

12

against  against thorns. 

13
14
15

 So you want us to hold that items that are 
worn for purposes of protection are not clothing? 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

No, Your Honor.  We've 

16

been  we've tried to be quite specific about that.  We 

17

distinguish between items that are designed and worn to 

18

protect from a workplace hazard.  And the court of 

19

appeals argued that everything is, in a sense, 

20

protective. 

21

 That is not the standard that we propose. 

22

Workplace hazards are  are different.  And in ordinary 

23

usage, when things are being used for that kind of 

24

protection, they are typically described in other terms. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So if it  if it protects

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

against something other than workplace hazard, it can be 

2

clothes.  But if it protects against a workplace hazard, 

3

it isn't clothing.  Is that your test?  Excuse me. 

4

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

And it's designed to provide 

5

that kind of protection.  Let me explain why  why 

6

we've added that.  There are some instances in which one 

7

would wear ordinary clothing on the job, things that are 

8

no different from what you would buy at J.C. Penney's, 

9

because it was, to some degree, protective from a 

10
11

workplace hazard. 
 That's true here. 

Whatever else you are 

12

wearing, underneath it, you have to wear cotton or wool. 

13

You can't wear 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But what if you are working 

15

out in the sun?  So you are wearing clothing, so that 

16

you don't get burned by the sun.  What if you are 

17

working out in the cold and you wear a parka, so that 

18

you don't freeze while you're working?  Are those 

19

workplace hazards? 

20

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I don't think, in ordinary 

21

parlance, they would be called a workplace hazard.  I 

22

mean, that's just  that's just the normal vicissitudes 

23

of life.  But to give you an example of 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So the guy who works in 

a freezer is not experiencing a normal hazard?  So

the 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I submit  I think that 

3

that you would be wearing a parka in a freezer just 

4

because it was warmer.  I mean, if you stayed there all 

5

day, it would be dangerous.  Dangerous cold is the South 

6

Pole.  The South Pole is a hazard. 

7

 There will be times when the weather 

8

forecast will be it's so cold that it's dangerous to go 

9

outside.  And I think it's that degree of 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So you have to pay a 

11

worker who's in the South Pole overtime for putting on 

12

his parka?

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, you put on more than a 

parka.  I think that's  that's the point 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

To put on his leggings 

and things like that? 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

There's a whole lot of stuff 

that I'm sure that goes on. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I lived in Chicago when it 

never got above zero for two weeks. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

There would come a point 

22

where  where I think people would call it a hazard in 

23

ordinary English. 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But 

25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

But those  those are not

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the cases that come up.  I mean, we have given you, in 

2

an appendix to our reply brief, a list of all the cases 

3

in the last 20 years that we could find involving 203. 

4

That's not what actually happens. 

5

 I mean, we are trying to give you something 

6

that makes sense of what's going on.  The overwhelming 

7

majority of cases involve things everyone would call a 

8

hazard  knives, molten metal, acids. 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I have  I do have an 

10

understanding that you're right, that jewelry are not 

11

clothes, that toupees might not be, that makeup is not, 

12

and they cover the body.  So I agree that a definition 

13

that says anything that covers the body might go too 

14

far. 

15

 But I do have a problem with things that 

16

look like clothes.  If I don't buy your  your argument 

17

that fireresistant pants and shirts are not clothes, 

18

where would you propose I draw the line?  Assume I say 

19

you are wrong on least  if it looks like clothes, it 

20

is clothes. 

21
22
23

 Let's apply a little bit of common sense to 
life. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I'm not entirely sure 

24

where  what we would fall back to  let me  let me 

25

respond to that question, though, the premise of it a

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

little bit. 
 There is  there is an old saying that, if 

3

it looks like a duck and it swims like a duck and it 

4

quacks like a duck, it's a duck. 

5
6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
saying. 

7

 (Laughter.) 

8

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

9

It's a very famous 

Right, right.  Well, 

there's  there's  but part of the takeaway from that 

10

is you have  whether you call something a duck, 

11

depends on all the information you have.  Let me 

12

change  let me change it a little bit. 

13

 It looks like a duck, it's floating there in 

14

the water, there is a quacking sound, and there are some 

15

men in a shed wearing camouflage gear and guns; it's 

16

probably not a duck.  And yet, if you took a picture of 

17

just the duck 

18
19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

are "wearing guns," not in this case. 

20

 (Laughter.) 

21

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

22

No, they are wearing 

camouflage and holding guns. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

25

You don't want to say they 

And holding guns. 
Holding.  I certainly 

misspoke.

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I certainly  yes.  But 

3

but our point is whether  how you characterize 

4

something depends on all the information.  Now, you may 

5

want to  you may want to conclude, although I think it 

6

would be wrong, that even when you have all the 

7

information, even if you understand that this is 

8

protective in nature, you understand that it has to be 

9

worn because of very severe dangers. 

10

 You understand that the person is wearing a 

11

hood over his head, not because it's cold, but because, 

12

although it's probably 100 degrees where he is working, 

13

he is in danger of being burned if he doesn't wear it. 

14

If, after that, you call it clothes, I disagree with 

15

you.  But I think that's at least the right way to 

16

analyze it. 

17

 But to say a picture looks like clothes is 

18

to  is to ask how we would characterize something if 

19

we didn't have all the information.  That is certainly 

20

inappropriate.  You have to assess it with all the other 

21

things that you know and in the full context. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I have an underlying 

23

question, just for my understanding of this.  Now, the 

24

unions are on your side and  I think, and I wondered 

25

why.  And I'll  this is my thought, which suggests

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that  that I may not understand this perfectly. 

2

 It seemed like, to me, a brilliant statute, 

3

because if, in fact, the unions  those they represent, 

4

the workers, don't want  want to be paid for donning 

5

and doffing, all they have to do is not put something in 

6

the collective bargaining agreement. 

7

 But  and if they do put something in the 

8

collective bargaining agreement, they can exert their 

9

bargaining power to get something else, which they must 

10

want more.  So you with your narrow definition do 

11

is you prevent the workers from doing that.  And so I 

12

don't know why the ordinary worker would be on your side 

13

of it. 

14

 Now, I say that because I want you to 

15

explain what I'm missing. 

16

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I am delighted that you 

17

asked that question.  It raises a number of issues, some 

18

of them having to do with the way the statute operates 

19

today, some of them historical. 

20

 Let me start with the way the statute 

21

operates today.  You said, to paraphrase, all they have 

22

to do is not put something in the agreement and then 

23

they have to be paid. 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Yes. 
That is not what the statute

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

says, and it's not the way it works.  The statute says 

2

in the agreement or a custom under the agreement. 

3

 The lower courts, as we've explained in our 

4

reply brief, have taken the position that what that 

5

means is, if there is a collective bargaining agreement 

6

and it doesn't expressly require that they be paid for 

7

the stuff, then not paying for it is a custom under the 

8

contract. 

9

 And so what actually happens is, in this 

10

negotiation ­ and it is described in one of these 

11

cases, the gear changes over time.  An employer comes in 

12

and says, I want you to wear some additional gear.  The 

13

union objects and says, that  that's wrong, we ought 

14

to be paid for it. 

15

 They don't succeed in negotiating 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

I see, so that's where the 

problem lies. 

18

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It goes the other way. 
Is there a way around that 

20

that doesn't involve this case, the Secretary of Labor? 

21

Or I guess you can amend the statute, but that's tough.  I 

22

mean 

23

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, that's the way the 

24

statute works now, and that explains  it's part of the 

25

reason why they are there.  But there's something

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

broader, and this will take a minute, but the historical 

2

context is uniquely important to understanding why there 

3

was opposition to this at the time.  It's sort of a 

4

threeact play, so bear with me. 

5

 The first has to do with the three lawsuits 

6

that lead to the PortaltoPortal Act.  Those are 

7

lawsuits between employers and unions.  The CIO, at this 

8

point in time, was advancing the rights of workers and 

9

interests of workers in two ways:  A, in negotiations; 

10

and, B, if they couldn't get something in negotiations, 

11

but they thought it was required under the Fair Labor 

12

Standards Act, then they would sue, or they would take 

13

the position in negotiations that you had to be 

14

provided.  There is a 1991 Buffalo Law Review article 

15

that describes this history. 

16

 In one of those cases, the union actually 

17

struck unsuccessfully for this and then proceeded on a 

18

legal track.  So that was what the CIO was doing.  They 

19

wanted both  they wanted both the statute and 

20

negotiation. 

21

 In the House version of the PortaltoPortal 

22

Act, Section 3 effectively banned that.  Section 3 said 

23

if this  if something's going on, and it's a company 

24

practice, and it doesn't violate the collective 

25

bargaining agreement, it's legal.

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 It grandfathered  and this was  the CIO 

2

objected to this.  And this was not adopted.  It 

3

grandfathered in all existing violations.  Indeed, it 

4

it prospectively grandfathered things in, because if 

5

they would adopt a new practice, it would be illegal. 

6

 And the example that the CIO gave was suppose 

7

it was the practice of the employer to turn back 

8

the clock an hour every day.  And that would have 

9

been  that would have been permitted.  So the Senate 

10
11

rejected that, and it didn't end up in the bill. 
 Now, what happens is this comes back in 

12

another version in 1949 with a very different Congress. 

13

And  and my brother has referenced the  a comment 

14

it's buried in the long statement by the National 

15

Association of Manufacturers  essentially asking for 

16

the  this old language.  They did it a little bit 

17

differently. 

18

 It  it would be a mistake to assume 

19

Congress just picked up the work of the last Congress in 

20

'49 and said, oh, well, we didn't  all we were trying 

21

to accomplish didn't get accomplished, so let's work on 

22

it some more.  The '48 elections had completely changed 

23

Congress. 

24

 As you may recall, Dewey did not win that 

25

election.  The Republicans lost the House.  They lost

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Senate.  The sponsor of the House bill was defeated, 

2

and the new members of the House and Senate included 

3

Hubert Humphrey and Gene McCarthy and a very different 

4

group of people. 

5

 They were not there to further the  the 

6

agenda of the last Congress.  The Herder Amendment was a 

7

somewhat  the  not what was adopted  what was 

8

proposed was a version of this. 

9

 It said anything about the length of the 

10

workday is  is legal if it's in a contract or in a 

11

custom or practice under a contract.  It doesn't 

12

didn't  we know from experience that custom or 

13

practice under a contract works to grandfather things 

14

old things and new things. 

15

 It went over to the Senate, and the Senate 

16

rejected that and then ended up with this narrowly drawn 

17

provision. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

20

Counsel 

Sorry that's so long, but 

that's why. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We began with the 

22

assumption that the unions are on your side.  Is the 

23

United Steelworkers of America on your side? 

24
25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

No, they have not filed. 

They  they agreed in the last collective bargaining

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

agreement not  not to file. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, it does seem 

3

to support to notion that this is something that should 

4

be left to the collective bargaining process. 

5

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Your Honor, it's not 

6

being  the view of  of the opponents of this kind of 

7

proposal, which was defeatedly  repeatedly directed, 

8

was it isn't being let  you're  you're essentially 

9

carving unionized plants out of the protections of the 

10
11

statutes. 
 You're stripping the workers of their 

12

statutory rights and saying to a union, if you can 

13

negotiate for something, that's fine, but the  but the 

14

statute 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, the point would 

16

be that the steelworkers gave up something when  you 

17

know, it's part of a bargain.  Okay?  If they say, all 

18

right, we're not going to count this time, but  you 

19

know, you've got to give us ten more cents an hour or 

20

you know, greater cafeteria facilities or something. 

21

It's a normal part of the bargaining process. 

22

 And it seems to me that, if they're willing 

23

to give it up to get something else, what's  what's 

24

the benefit to them of saying you can't do that? 

25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

If I  again, if I might

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

return to the first part of my answer to 

2

Justice Breyer's question.  The way this ordinarily 

3

works, and it's reflective in cases we've described in 

4

our yellow brief, is that the company's position is this 

5

is  we don't need your permission to do this. 

6

 And  and that's true  that's true in one 

7

sense, which is if it's not permitted  unless the 

8

contract bans it, it becomes a de facto practice, and 

9

it's legal.  But it's also usually the company's 

10

position that  that the union is wrong about the 

11

meaning of Fair Labor Standards Act. 

12

 There's a dispute in this case on the part 

13

of the company as to whether this is a principal 

14

activity.  They've argued it is de minimis so this is an issue 

15

about which people bargain the way they would bargain 

16

about an extra holiday.  But it is not a situation where 

17

the union walks in, is entitled to this, and trades it 

18

for something.  That simply isn't what's going on. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, but if the union  is 

20

it consistent with the union's duty to represent your 

21

client for them to bargain away something to which your 

22

clients are entitled under the Fair Labor Standards Act? 

23
24
25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

The company's position is 

it's  it's not something that they're entitled to. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, no, the union.  If the

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

union 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I  I understand  I 

3

understand the question.  But  but the union can go in 

4

and say, we think we're entitled to this under the Fair 

5

Labor Standards Act, and the company would say, no, we 

6

don't. 

7

 And then if they can't get it, it 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

9

Mr. Schnapper, can I ask 

you another question?  We're talking about time and 

10

whether it will be paid.  And we have one worker that 

11

puts on this protective garb.  And then we have another, 

12

the baker.  It takes them about the same amount of time 

13

to do  put on everything he has to put on.  But 

14

everybody agrees, he doesn't get paid for that.  What 

15

is the  that that would come within the clothing. 

16

 So we have all kinds of people who have to 

17

wear special uniforms, a doorman at an apartment house. 

18

It takes them time to put it on.  Why should there be a 

19

distinction in getting paid between the protective garb 

20

and something that you must wear on the job?  That 

21

yes. 

22

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Okay.  Our answer to that, 

23

Justice Ginsburg, is that the statute says, "clothes," 

24

it doesn't say, "anything you wear."  And we agree with 

25

the government, that there are things you could put on

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that would not be clothes and that you'd have to be paid 

2

for. 

3

 And we  I think we disagree with the 

4

government about what those are.  But there's  but 

5

and, indeed, the court of appeals in this case and most 

6

courts of appeals have held that there are things you 

7

put on that are not clothes. 

8

 So the statute distinguishes between clothes 

9

and other things.  We have to figure out what that 

10
11

distinction means. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I thought that your 

12

distinction was, well, there are two sets of clothes 

13

to use a better word.  There are two sets of clothes, 

14

and they both look like clothes, but one is for 

15

protective  a protective function, and one is for a 

16

sanitary function.  And that's the distinction that you 

17

want to draw. 

18

 And I guess another way of saying Justice 

19

Ginsburg's question is:  Why should we look at a word 

20

that just says, "clothes," and make that distinction as 

21

to what the purpose of changing clothing is, whether 

22

it's for sanitary reasons or whether it's for protective 

23

reasons or whether it's because people want the doormen 

24

to look nice? 

25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, Your Honor, I think in

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ordinary parlance, whether you're going to call 

2

something clothes or not depends, as the government says 

3

at page 25 of its brief, on both its form and its 

4

function.  And there's a continuum of things, and you 

5

have to draw a line somewhere. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But common usage doesn't 

7

separate from the meaning of clothes only those  those 

8

protective garments that are required by the occupation, 

9

that are required by the employer.  That's a  that's a 

10
11

very strange definition of clothes. 
 Hunters, when  when they're hunting birds 

12

wear  wear trousers that are brushproof.  They  you 

13

know, resist briars and other things.  Those are 

14

protective.  And those  those pants wouldn't be worn 

15

elsewhere. 

16

 Now, I can understand you're arguing 

17

those are not clothes because they perform a protective 

18

function other than heat and cold.  But you're  you're 

19

proposing a very odd definition of clothes.  It excludes 

20

only those protective garments that are protection 

21

against workplace hazards.  That's very strange. 

22

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

All right.  Your Honor 

23

well, Your Honor, we are not undertaking to give you a 

24

comprehensive definition of what items are and aren't 

25

clothes.  The  the variety of things people wear is 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is extraordinarily complicated, and we  we have not 

2

taken that on. 

3

 What we have tried to suggest is 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, but you have taken it 

5

on.  You're trying to tell us what is the ordinary 

6

meaning of clothes.  That's what you're appealing to, 

7

the ordinary meaning. 

8

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10
11
12
13

Your Honor 
And I suggest the ordinary 

meaning is not  is not what you  you have proposed. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, we may disagree of the 

substance, but 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It includes protective 

14

garments, and  and you want it to include all 

15

protective garments, I guess, except those that protect 

16

against workplace hazards.  That's peculiar. 

17

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

All  all we're asking the 

18

Court to hold is that certain things are not clothes. 

19

We're not undertaking to sort out among the things that 

20

hunters wear, where you would draw the line.  I mean, 

21

ordinary  ordinary parlance is  is complicated.  But 

22

we think  look, it's certainly the case, we believe, 

23

that not everything people wear is clothes. 

24

 And the problem is to fashion a standard. 

25

We think the government standard simply doesn't work,

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and it doesn't work for two reasons.  Their standard, as 

2

we understand it  and my brother will address this in 

3

greater detail  is that the Court should distinguish 

4

between clothes, on the one hand, and equipment, 

5

devices, and tools, on the other. 

6

 Now, we think this doesn't work for a couple 

7

of reasons.  First of all, the  the distinction isn't 

8

clear.  In footnote 6, they note the lower courts have 

9

been divided about gloves, and then say they  they 

10
11

think gloves are clothes.  They don't explain it. 
 They note that the lower courts have been 

12

divided about leather aprons.  At page 24 and 25, they 

13

describe labor board decisions and some other things 

14

which  which have characterized certain items as 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, counsel, the 

16

whole approach here  you are saying you are not going 

17

to give us a test, you are just going to criticize 

18

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

20
21

No, no, no. 
 their test. I 

mean, it's 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

No.  Our test is an item is 

22

not clothes if it is worn to protect against a workplace 

23

hazard and was designed to protect against hazards. 

24

And  but  if I might just finish my point, the 

25

government standard is  it's not clear how they have

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

gotten where they did.  They noticed  there are 

2

divisions about a number of different things. 

3

 And then what they describe as on the 

4

notclothes side of the line on pages 24 and 25 sound a 

5

lot like what people are wearing here. 

6

 In addition, casting it as the government 

7

has forces the lower courts to decide what are 

8

equipment, tools, and devices because anything that is 

9

not an equipment, tool, or device would end up being 

10

clothes.  And that simply recasts the question about 

11

a  some words that are not in the statute. 

12

 The words that is somewhat broader and 

13

doesn't trigger all of this is "gear."  And if I might 

14

say just one or two things about it, the Court  the 

15

government used the word "gear" in its 1997, 2001, 2002, 

16

and 2010 opinion letters, although they take different 

17

substantive positions. 

18

 They quote the word "equipment" from this 

19

Court's decision in Alvarez, and the word "equipment" is 

20

there twice, but the word "gear" is used 28 times.  And 

21

a month ago, when I was here and the construction was 

22

still going on outside, there was a sign outside, and it 

23

depicted a worker with an arrow pointing to and 

24

labelling his hardhat, his goggles, his work gloves, and 

25

his boots.

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

3

 And it said, "Do not enter without proper 
gear."  So 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So what about heavy 

4

duty pants  you know, blue jeans that somebody  the 

5

thick ones that you use because the work environment 

6

will involve  you know, grease and hot things and all, 

7

but that you wouldn't necessarily  or a particular 

8

worker wouldn't wear off the steel mill site? 

9

 Is that clothing designed to protect against 

10

work hazards?  Or is it  some people would wear that 

11

outside the steel plant; other people wouldn't. 

12
13
14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Certainly, people wear blue 

jeans under all sorts of circumstances. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes, yes, but there 

15

are heavierduty blue jeans that are made out of a 

16

particular fabric that you would see commonly in the 

17

steel mill, but you maybe wouldn't see commonly outside. 

18

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

If  if there was something 

19

identifiable in the  in the  in the mill that was 

20

that was a hazard, that might fall there.  But we have 

21

also taken the position  and I'm not quite sure  I 

22

am not familiar with these particular kinds of 

23

clothes  items, that things that you would wear for 

24

that weren't designed to deal with hazards wouldn't 

25

be  wouldn't be within our carveout.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE C. DiNARDO 

6
7
8
9

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. DiNARDO: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 When Congress enacted 203(o), the 

10

PortaltoPortal Act had already relieved employers of 

11

the obligation to pay for changing into or out of 

12

ordinary clothing.  There is little question that 203(o) 

13

was directed at the sort of clothing that, absent 

14

203(o), could be deemed to be a principal activity, the 

15

changing into or out of clothing that was not already 

16

excluded by the preliminary and postliminary exclusion 

17

in the PortaltoPortal Act. 

18

 Congress referred in 203(o) to time spent 

19

changing clothes  to time spent changing clothes that 

20

is excluded from the workday, pursuant to an 

21

agreement  a collective bargaining agreement.  It was 

22

in the context of an agreement with the labor 

23

organization that the time would be excluded. 

24
25

 Collective bargaining takes place around 
activities and determines how certain activities are to

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be treated.  Collective bargaining does not focus on 

2

whether or not a shirt is clothes or a pair of pants are 

3

clothes or protective eye gear, and that is how the 

4

statute was written. 

5

 Given those two points, the term "clothes" 

6

as used in the statute was intended to encompass the 

7

work outfit industrial workers were required to change 

8

into and out of, to be ready for work.  That's the 

9

logical conclusion of 

10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Does that include a 

SCUBA tank? 

12

 MR. DiNARDO: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Your Honor 
Because you can wear 

14

anything to be ready for work.  I  my own inclination 

15

is to say that a respirator unit on your back is not 

16

clothes, the way a SCUBA tank isn't.  So it can't be 

17

just something that covers your body. 

18

 MR. DiNARDO: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20

 MR. DiNARDO: 

If the labor 
Or ready for work. 
If the labor organization and 

21

the employer, for whatever odd reason, would decide that 

22

part of the outfit you need to be ready to go to work 

23

included the tank  it doesn't make a lot of sense 

24

because it would make more sense to put the tank on when 

25

you get to the location where you are going to perform

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

your principal activities. 
 But were they to do that, that's what this 

3

statute empowered them to do.  And in terms of custom or 

4

practice, I should mention this 

5
6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

wasn't the statute written in that way? 

7

 MR. DiNARDO: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

Then why didn't  why 

It wasn't written that way 
Why wasn't it written 

I mean, they use very specific words, "changing 

10

clothes."  That's, in my mind, narrower than your 

11

definition. 

12

 MR. DiNARDO: 

Well, Your Honor, they  they 

13

use those words with other words when they say, "any 

14

time spent in changing clothes," that the labor 

15

organization and the employer agree shall be excluded. 

16

They don't say it in the abstract. 

17

 It is pursuant to an agreement. 

And a 

18

custom or practice, and the case law will bear this out, 

19

is an agreement.  It is not unilateral action, Your 

20

Honor.  It is by either very open acquiescence or 

21

longterm acquiescence 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, what I think he's 

23

saying is this, that my puzzle was, why was this a big 

24

deal for the unions?  All they have to do is keep their 

25

mouths shut, and the employer is going to have to go to

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

them and say, we want this in the agreement. 
 But he says, but you haven't read those words 

3

"custom or practice," and if you see the words "custom 

4

or practice," you'll see that an awful lot of businesses 

5

or firms or manufacturing across the country actually 

6

has long had a custom or practice where they didn't pay 

7

for that  you know, they didn't exclude it, or they 

8

didn't  so in those circumstances, it's the union 

9

that's going to have to go to the employer and say, 

10

please put some other words in the agreement, so we get 

11

this out of the statute.  And now, I have no idea  I 

12

think that's what his point was. 

13

 And, of course, this is an empirical 

14

question in part of that kind of point, which is 

15

logically sound, affects a certain number of workers in 

16

industries.  And I would next be curious if either you 

17

or the SG or anyone has some estimate of what we are 

18

talking about quantitatively. 

19

 MR. DiNARDO: 

So,the first part of the 

20

question, the notion of custom or practice is a notion 

21

of agreement or, at the very least, longtime 

22

acquiescence.  If a union is not able to get a provision 

23

in a labor contract that satisfies it on this subject, 

24

it seem  it simply needs to object to the nonpayment. 

25

 And then the question becomes is this

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

clothes changing preliminary or postliminary under the 

2

Portal Act and, therefore, not work?  Or is this a 

3

principal activity that, absent an agreement under 

4

Section 203(o), is work and must be paid? 

5

 The notion that custom or practice is 

6

something that an employer can unilaterally adopt is 

7

simply false.  It  there must be the union's 

8

agreement, either expressly, as there has been for 

9

60 years in this labor contract between the Steel 

10

Workers and U.S. Steel, that this entire block of time 

11

will be excluded; or a union must say, by its silence 

12

or  absent an agreement  a formal written agreement, but its 

13

verbal agreement, this is acceptable to us, we need not 

14

be paid for this beginningoftheday block of time. 

15

 And our suggestion that the test ought to be 

16

what these parties agree will be part of the work outfit 

17

that will start the day is, in large measure, a 

18

recognition of the way collective bargaining operates. 

19

 A labor union and an employer don't say, 

20

should there be pay for putting the hat on or putting 

21

the jacket on?  The discussion surrounds what do we do 

22

about this 10 minutes or 5 minutes or 3 minutes or 

23

15 minutes that precedes active, productive work?  Do we 

24

include that activity? 

25

 Now, granted, Your Honor, they  they said

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

any time spent in changing clothes pursuant to a 

2

collective bargaining agreement because that was the 

3

nature of the debate that preceded the 1949 amendment. 

4

 The Department of Labor said, perhaps some 

5

clothes changing is not preliminary or postliminary, 

6

perhaps it is a principal activity.  They started the 

7

discussion around clothes changing. 

8
9

 But the industrial practice that was being 
debated was this beginningoftheday activity, the 

10

locker room activity of getting yourself invested in the 

11

outfit you need to wear to be ready for work. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. DiNardo, in this 

13

case, does it matter if we take your position that 

14

anything you need to wear to be ready for work or the 

15

government's position  and I think it was the Seventh 

16

Circuit's position, too  that equipment is different 

17

from clothes? 

18

 But, here, the Seventh Circuit said the 

19

equipment that's involved, hard hats, glasses, earplugs, 

20

respirator, none of those things  that they  they 

21

take de minimis time, so we don't have to worry about 

22

them. 

23

 In this case, will it make a difference if 

24

we go your way and say, everything worn counts; or the 

25

government's way, saying, well, at least clothes

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

count, but equipment can be distinguished? 
 MR. DiNARDO: 

So in our particular case, 

3

Your Honor, this does not matter.  The  the items, the 

4

hard hat, the earplugs, the protective eye gear, and the 

5

respirator are not at issue in this case.  The  the 

6

lower court said the time is de minimis, and it doesn't 

7

matter. 

8
9

 Clearly, the items here are clothes. 

The 

government agrees they're clothes.  They're clothes by 

10

any measure, by any test.  But on a goingforward basis, 

11

this notion that there is a dichotomy between clothes 

12

and equipment is a problem. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, when would it matter? 

14

Could you give a few examples of when it would make a 

15

difference, the  the difference between your test and 

16

the government's test? 

17

 MR. DiNARDO: 

Well, it'll make a difference, 

18

Your Honor, in  in all of those circumstances, where 

19

part of the outfit that you put on to wear to be ready 

20

to work is not something that one might, absent an 

21

industrial context, look at and say, intuitively, that's 

22

clothing. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, like what, that's not 

de minimis? 
 MR. DiNARDO: 

So, for  for example 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

well, in many respects, I should say, these sorts of 

2

items are, in fact, de minimis.  It takes seconds for a 

3

police officer to put a  a vest on that has  that's 

4

made of Kevlar, for example, a modern fabric that can 

5

protect, and yet, it's specialized, but it's a matter of 

6

seconds. 

7

 But that's the sort of argument you would 

8

leave the lower courts to deal with.  Is  is that 

9

vest  one might call it equipment, the government 

10

might, we don't know, or they might call it clothing. 

11

And here's an opportunity to deal with that in a 

12

definitive sort of way. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess it just seems that, 

14

in most of these cases, everybody is just going to say 

15

it takes two seconds to put on a pair of eyeglasses.  So 

16

I guess I'm  I'm struggling with why you and the 

17

government are fighting so hard about the proper test. 

18

 MR. DiNARDO: 

Well, again, we're not 

19

fighting that hard because they  they urge affirmance. 

20

But the proper test  I would suggest this:  As as 

21

the court of appeals mentioned, is this clothing or 

22

equipment, and it answered its own question, well, 

23

really it's both.  The problem with trying that 

24

dichotomy is you'll leave everyone to argue is this 

25

particular item "equipment "?

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So is  is the  is the worker in the meat 

2

factory's chainlink vest  vest or shirt, they call it 

3

a shirt, but it's made out of chain link  is that 

4

equipment, or is that clothes? 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think  I think the 

6

government is  you and the government are fighting 

7

simply because the government is being principled.  The 

8

word of the statute is "clothes."  And nobody would 

9

consider eyeglasses or a wristwatch or some of this 

10

other specialized equipment to be clothes.  I mean, the 

11

word is what it is. 

12

 And  and, I mean, it's wonderful to say, 

13

we can eliminate all the problems by  you know, saying 

14

everything is clothes  you know, everything, no matter 

15

what, wristwatch, eyeglasses.  Well, yes, it makes a 

16

a lovely world. 

17

 But it does not adhere to the words of the 

18

statute, which says, "clothes."  Doesn't that mean 

19

anything?  Everything is clothes. 

20
21
22

 MR. DiNARDO: 

It  it does mean something, 

but it must be read as part of any time spent 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, what is difficult? 

23

Why not just say clothes  at least from your point of 

24

view, clothes are  are those items that have, as a 

25

significant purpose, the covering of one's body.  That's

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Well, is there anything 

Yes. 
And, therefore, what's 

wrong with the definition I just proposed? 
 MR. DiNARDO: 

Well, as a practical matter, 

24

labor organizations and employers don't negotiate that 

25

way.  They don't say, we'll pay you for the eyeglasses,

but we won't for the shirt. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, that's  that's up 

3

to them how they negotiate.  But  but the statute 

4

says, "clothes," so we would have to pay for the clothes

Or custom and 
And then you look up the 

13

definition of clothes, and it's any covering for the

human body, and it includes accessories.  So 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No.  Why  why does it 

16

include eyeglasses?  Eyeglasses do not have as a 

17

principal  as a significant purpose the covering of 

18

one's body. 

19

 MR. DiNARDO: 

The safety glasses that go

over the eyeglasses are, in fact, designed to cover 

21

the  part of the face.  They are designed to cover 

22

part of the face.  If we leave

that everything you put on is clothes. 
 MR. DiNARDO: 

But it's not everything you 

put on.  It's a work outfit 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Earrings, eyeglasses, 

whatever. 
 MR. DiNARDO: 

It would be the work outfit 

7

that the employer and the union agreed you need to have 

8

on your person to be ready for work. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You  you cannot get that 

10

very precise limitation out of the word "clothes."  You 

11

just can't.  And say it's only protective gear for work, it's 

12

not other protective gear.  Okay?  It's only those 

13

earrings you have to wear for work, otherwise, earrings 

14

are not clothes.  Ah, but if they're required for work, 

15

they become clothes. 

16

 That  it doesn't make any sense. 

17

 MR. DiNARDO: 

It's  it's less required for 

18

work as it is  the Congress was after allowing this 

19

block of time to be dealt with by 

20
21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So maybe we can call them 

"constructive clothes," which means they're not clothes. 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 MR. DiNARDO: 

And it's less the individual 

24

nature of the item as it is the activity.  Is this part 

25

of the activity of changing your clothes?  And if part

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the activity of changing your clothes is taking off 

2

your eyeglasses and putting them in your locker and 

3

putting safety glasses on, that piece of time is covered 

4

by the statute, even though, in reality, the union 

5

wouldn't bargain over that piece of time. 

6

 They would argue  they would bargain over, 

7

what shall we do with this preshift attire.  Leaving

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Your  your definition 

10

would include somebody spending an hour of putting on a 

11

suit of armor, if he's going to be a jouster.  It would 

12

include the space people who put on that complicated 

13

white suit that has all the connections to equipment. 

14

 MR. DiNARDO: 

Well, I would suggest  I 

15

would suggest that what it's made of should not matter, 

16

so the material shouldn't matter.

In terms of the time

Right. 
The function shouldn't matter. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If function doesn't 

matter, then how do we define "clothes"? 
 MR. DiNARDO: 

The function doesn't matter 

because 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Function covers the 

body.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DiNARDO: 

Sometimes, it could be for 

2

protection; sometimes, it could be for identification. 

3

So some people have to wear certain things, so they're 

4

identified.  Other people have to wear things at work, 

5

so they are protected.  I think that shouldn't matter. 

6

 And the length of time, frankly, shouldn't 

7

matter because the agreement must be bona fide.  The 

8

statute has a protection for a union that doesn't 

9

extract something in exchange for agreeing that this 

10
11

increment of time will be excluded. 
 The  the statute requires that the labor 

12

agreement be a bona fide labor agreement.  So the  the 

13

obligation of bargaining and  and fulfilling your 

14

obligation of fair representation is built into the 

15

statute. 

16

 I believe there's been a great deal of focus 

17

on an itembyitem investigation of these issues in 

18

countless numbers of these cases, and that is the wrong 

19

approach. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, nothing has been said 

21

about the word "changing."  Maybe you could say 

22

something about that.  Isn't it  isn't it awkward to 

23

refer to the changing of clothes when all that the 

24

person is doing is putting on clothing on top of 

25

clothing that the person is already wearing?

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DiNARDO: 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

3

is normally used, is it? 

4

 MR. DiNARDO: 

So, Your Honor 
That's not the way the term 

So I would say this:  In this 

5

particular case, the facts of this case, and the 

6

record's replete with declarations, the most common 

7

event is a worker comes to his locker, takes off some of 

8

their clothes, they have to  they're required to put 

9

their personal long underwear shirt on and long 

10

underwear pants on, then the gear that's in the  the 

11

gear  then the clothing that's in the picture. 

12

That's  that's the actual events in this case. 

13

 But if someone were to come in and  in 

14

their long underwear and not have to take their outer 

15

clothes off and just put the items that are in the 

16

record on, then the question becomes have they changed 

17

because they have simply layered? 

18

 I would say this: 

It's not the most common 

19

use of the term "changing," but it is a  it is a 

20

definition of changing, "to make different."  I think it 

21

would happen here.  So it's actually not the facts of 

22

this particular case. 

23

 I think the word is certainly broad enough 

24

to encompass  and, lastly, it would make no sense in 

25

the statute to allow the personal idiosyncrasies of

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

those people coming to work, someone who decides to 

2

layer their items over what they have on, someone else 

3

who decides to take them off before they layer. 

4

 I would say that reading the statute as an 

5

activitybased statute is consistent as well with the 

6

notion of washing, which is in this statute.  We don't 

7

think of turning a shower on, necessarily, or retrieving 

8

a towel as washing.  The statute excludes time spent 

9

washing, and we don't try to drill down what exactly is 

10

washing. 

11

 We say, in close cases, the determining 

12

factor should be the agreement the labor organization 

13

has reached with the employer.  Leave all of this 

14

craziness about whether a particular item is covered or 

15

not covered to the parties closest to deal with it, the 

16

labor organization and the employer, who have had, in 

17

this particular case, 60 years of dealing with this. 

18

 If you say to a worker at U.S. Steel, "Go 

19

change your clothes," they will know exactly what you 

20

meant.  And they will take that to mean, "Put my hard 

21

hat on.  Put my protective eyewear on." 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Are there no nonunionized 

23

employers that  that have to confront this problem, 

24

and they have to pay  they have to pay for work time, 

25

Unless it's preliminary or 

postliminary. 

11

13

Yes, and everybody else has 

Well, yes  it's 
And  and the union cannot 

pull your chestnuts out of the fire. 
 MR. DiNARDO: 

Well, of course, there is no 

15

union present, so the question becomes is it preliminary 

16

activity, is it ordinary clothes changing that's not a 

17

principal activity, et cetera? 

18

 There's  clearly, this applies in 

19

unionized workplaces.  There is a representative of 

20

these employees.  They can bargain over these blocks of 

21

time, over these activities, and determine how best to

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG, 
 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 
 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. YANG: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Yang, I will let you 

7

speak, but could you answer Justice Scalia's question? 

8

Would our  if we were to adopt your colleague's 

9

broader definition, would it affect a preliminary and 

10
11

postactivity definition? 
 MR. YANG: 

Not at all.  We only get to the 

12

question of Section 3(o) when a preliminary activity is 

13

deemed to be so integral and indispensable to the 

14

primary work that itself is primary work and, therefore, 

15

would be compensable. 

16

 So as, for instance, the Court held in 

17

Steiner, there was chemical plant workers who the 

18

donning and doffing of their clothing for work purposes 

19

was so indispensable to their chemical factory work, it 

20

was deemed to be essential.  In that context, you might 

21

have a collective bargaining agreement that allows the 

22

union, on behalf of the employees and the employer, to 

23

provide for an alternative method of compensating this 

24

type of work. 

25

 And, in that context, there are two central

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inquiries that I would like to address today.  First, 

2

are the items clothes?  We think "clothes" actually has 

3

some textual meaning here and imposes a limit, which I'd 

4

like to discuss a bit further later. 

5

 But, second, if the employee puts on both 

6

clothes and some nonclothes items, does the overall 

7

process still, nevertheless, constitute the activity of 

8

changing clothes? 

9

 Now, we didn't have to go into great depth 

10

into that question in our brief because all the items 

11

here are clothes.  But I think it would be actually 

12

quite useful to discuss, for a little bit, the activity 

13

of changing clothes and then to discuss the specifics. 

14

I think it would help the Court out at least in 

15

providing a more general rule. 

16

 The activity of changing clothes is used in 

17

the  in the statute to exclude time spent in changing 

18

clothes.  Congress used the gerund "changing" to 

19

describe an activity.  It is a verb form that's modified 

20

by changing, not by clothes.  So it is an activity of 

21

changing clothes.  We think that activity also includes 

22

ancillary matters. 

23

 So, for instance, if a worker comes into a 

24

locker room, spends some time doing the combination on 

25

the locker, opens it up, take  opens the locker, that

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is not actually changing clothes, per se, but it's part 

2

of the activity of changing clothes. 

3

 So, for instance, if the worker also happens 

4

to put on some goggles, pop in an ear plug, maybe even 

5

snap on a utility belt in the context of changing 

6

clothes, those things are part of "changing clothes," as 

7

part of the statute.  Now 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So, then, what does separate 

you from Mr. DiNardo?  Now, you're sounding exactly the 
same. 
 MR. YANG: 

Well, no, I don't think so 

12

because, on the margin, we are largely the same.  I 

13

think, for the mine run of cases, we will be at the same 

14

result. 

15

 However, there are some marginal cases where 

16

there is a collection of equipment  we would  what 

17

we would deem to be equipment, which is put on by an 

18

employee that is so significant that it no longer can be 

19

fairly treated in conjunction with changing clothes. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

21

 MR. YANG: 

Like what? 
Well, this is an area  an issue 

22

that comes up frequently in the meat packing industry. 

23

And I can explain  I need to explain a little bit 

24

about the facts to explain why we think that that is a 

25

much more difficult question.

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So, in the meat packing industry, for 

2

instance, particularly meat packers that are rendering 

3

large portions of the beef, either with electric saws or 

4

very sharp knives or similar instruments, they actually 

5

have to put on what the government considers to be  or 

6

has considered to be items of equipment. 

7

 So, for instance, the meat packer might have 

8

a chain mail, kind of like armor sleeve, chain mail 

9

gloves, another sleeve, chain mail kind of all over the 

10

front end, a belly guard  a Plexiglas belly guard. 

11

This is something that is very rigid, you can't even sit 

12

down on it. 

13

 And, in fact, you have to sterilize it in a 

14

chemical bath before you go into the plant.  You have 

15

metal arm guard  or a metal  or, now, Plexiglas 

16

because of weight  arm guard on the front that helps 

17

to deflect blows for your nonknife arm. 

18

 These types of things, we think, would not 

19

normally be thought of as clothing.  And so, when you 

20

put on a smock, either before  you know, or under or 

21

over it, we think that the overall process there might 

22

not be fairly deemed to be considered changing clothes. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what's the 

24

difference?  Isn't this what some courts have described 

25

as de minimis activity, as they did with the safety

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

glasses and the hat and the ear plugs?  How about a 

2

metal apron, that some meat packers only do a metal 

3

apron? 

4

 MR. YANG: 

Right.  Well, that may well 

5

this is, again, going to be somewhat factdependent, and 

6

I don't mean to provide a general rule for all cases. 

7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, actually, that's 

what we are looking for, so why don't you? 
 (Laughter.) 
 MR. YANG: 

No, no. I think, while we are 

11

trying to provide general principles, they're not necessarily 

12

going to resolve all cases, and they're not always going 

13

to make the case easy, and I think, on the margin, and 

14

the meat packer does involve a marginal case, you're 

15

going to have the questions. 

16

 If it's just one item 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What you just said  what 

18

you just said, I find quite confusing.  I can make a 

19

list of things that are considered to be clothing.  One 

20

of them would be a jacket, perhaps.  One would be a 

21

vest.  And if you tell me that a vest is not clothing if 

22

it's made out of metal, then I don't know why Mr. 

23

Schnapper is not right that a jacket is not a jacket if 

24

it's got extra flame protection  protecting chemicals 

25

in it.

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. YANG: 

Our point is a linguistic point, 

2

which is to say I don't think all these things are 

3

normally characterized as clothing.  For instance, there 

4

are certain items in the body that are so distinctive in 

5

form and function, they don't have normal analogues in 

6

what you would find people wearing in ordinary 

7

garments  you know, in everyday life, that it's deemed 

8

to be different. 

9

 There are certain armortype things, and I 

10

think maybe because, etymologically, armor, with 

11

the unique military context, tends to  we tend to call 

12

these things equipment. 

13

 But, for instance, the belly guards, In IBP, 

14

this Court called those things "protective equipment," 

15

and I think that's the normal use of the term in that 

16

context.  Just because you might say, oh, it's a vest, a 

17

chain mail vest for the specific function, particularly 

18

when aggregated with the rest of the equipment used in 

19

the meat packing industry, makes it an arguably 

20

different case. 

21

 This case, however, I think is quite 

22

different, and I wouldn't necessarily use the term "de 

23

minimis."  We agree with the general concept that the 

24

Seventh Circuit reached, but de minimis is a term of art 

25

in the FLSA.  It involves, as we explained to the Court,

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in our Tum brief, which is the companion case to  to 

2

IBP, it requires an aggregation of all the time deemed 

3

to be de minimis.  There is a regulation, Section 

4

785.47, that imposes some other requirements. 

5
6
7

 We think it's not so helpful to use that 
term, but we do think 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But when somebody in the 

8

meat packing industry puts on something that would be 

9

clothing, but also puts on all these other things that 

10

you say are not clothing, now, you would say in that 

11

situation putting on all of this additional stuff is not 

12

ancillary, and that is for what reason?  Because it 

13

takes more time in relation to the clothing or the 

14

number of nonclothing items exceeds the number of 

15

nonclothing items?  What does that mean? 

16

 MR. YANG: 

Well, I think it means that when 

17

the process is predominantly involving equipment and not 

18

clothes, we would think that it's different.  And  and 

19

I don't think there's really any question that there has 

20

to be a line. 

21

 For instance, if an employer had an employee 

22

go out and, as part of the changing clothes, also go and 

23

collect your tools for the day and assemble them in your 

24

tool belt, no one would say that's changing clothes, 

25

even if, at the end of the  all of that, you put on

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

your top  your jacket and you walked out. 
 So we're simply trying to draw a line that I 

3

think faithfully reflects the common understanding of 

4

clothes in this context.  At the same time, we believe 

5

that the term "clothes" is quite broad. 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Do you have any estimate on 

7

the empirical  there are only two people that know, 

8

the Department of Labor and the AFLCIO, and they didn't 

9

tell us, the latter.  So  so what we're thinking of, I 

10
11

think, is workplace hazard clothing.  Okay? 
 And the problem, I think, that was raised is 

12

that the union can't stop  can't  can't  can't 

13

make an agreement about this, without a lot of trouble 

14

anyway.  They can't just shut up, in other words, and 

15

see that the  there'll be compensation because there's 

16

a custom or practice in the industry of giving  of not 

17

giving the compensation.

and leggings, but these things are quite analogous to 

2

what we would have in normal clothing. 

3

 And then you have some things that are on 

4

the edge.  But we think that, when that's done in 

5

conjunction with changing clothes, that it's incidental, 

6

just as an employee might put on a name tag after they 

7

dress or put on their ID badge for security purposes or

snap on a utility belt

incidental, instead of de minimis?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

You want us to say it's 

That's  that's our preference. 
What  what's the 

consequence of calling it "incidental"? 
 MR. YANG: 

Well, we think it avoids 

15

complications and problems with the special doctrine 

16

that applies more generally in the FLSA, which is the de 

17

minimis  De Minimis Time Doctrine.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I'd like to address a number 

23

of questions I was asked earlier and then to respond 

24

to a point my brother made. 

25

 With regard to the question of

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Breyer, it is the experience of the United Food 

2

and Commercial Workers that the position companies take 

3

with regard to this  these items is simply another 

4

bargainable unit  item, like a holiday.  It is not 

5

treated by them as something unions are entitled to. 

6

 Justice Ginsburg, you asked why it matters 

7

here and whether the items  how we characterize the 

8

items about which the government would disagree with the 

9

company, at least in isolation.  And it matters for two 

10

reasons that have to do with the broader context of the 

11

Fair Labor Standards Act. 

12

 First, as we explained in our reply brief, 

13

there is an unchallenged rule that  that an employer 

14

has to pay a worker for carrying tools or other things 

15

needed to do the job to the  the work station. 

16

 If anything in this list isn't clothes and 

17

the workers have to have it at the work station, it 

18

would presumptively fall within the toolcarrying rule. 

19

So it's very important to the company in this case that 

20

all of it be clothes. 

21

 It's also important under the position that 

22

the government took in its brief in Tum, which was a 

23

companion case to Alvarez, the government's 

24

position, with which we agree, is that once there is any 

25

non203(o) exempt item, it starts the calculation of the

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

de minimis time, which then includes, not only the time 

2

for that item, but the travel time that follows. 

3

 It starts the de minimis clock. 

If that's 

4

right, then if anything in this case isn't 203(o) 

5

exempt, the company would have to change this practice. 

6

 Justice Kagan, you asked more broadly why 

7

the test matters.  And I think the government was moving 

8

in this direction.  There is generally few, if any, 

9

cases involving poultry or  poultry processing in 

10

which there's stuff that would  would meet the, well, 

11

if I had a photograph of it, it looks like clothes test. 

12

It's almost all gear. 

13

 And so in that industry, it's of enormous 

14

importance the difference between the government's 

15

position in its  at least in its brief and the 

16

company's position.  That has great implications for 

17

those  those plants. 

18

 Finally, if I might respond to a point that 

19

the government made, the government has introduced 

20

another concept, I think, that's not set forth in their 

21

brief, but I want to address, and that's that, in 

22

addition to the process that would go on, on any of our 

23

standards of separating out what things are clothes and 

24

what things are not clothes, the government would then 

25

overlay that with an ancillary test.

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And if it's predominantly clothes, then the 

2

whole thing counts as clothes; if it's predominantly 

3

nonclothes, it goes the other way. 

4

 I don't know. 

I think that's another area 

5

of uncertainty you shouldn't inflict on the lower 

6

courts, and it's not consistent with the statute.  The 

7

statute doesn't say, "changing clothes and ancillary 

8

stuff."  I'd agree about opening the locker.  It's 

9

it's necessary to change your clothes. 

10

 But when you start taking things which, the 

11

government would agree, by themselves aren't clothes, 

12

and say, well, this  this falls within changing 

13

clothes, even though it's not clothes because it's sort 

14

of happening at the same time, seems to me you're 

15

opening up another can of worms that should stay closed. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Schnapper  I'm sorry. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What is the practice in the 

18

poultry industry to which you referred?  Are those 

19

unionized workplaces and have they bargained on this 

20

issue? 

21

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I believe about 60 percent 

22

are and the rest are not.  The poultry industry filed a 

23

brief 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And under  where they have 

collective bargaining agreements, are they compensated

55

Alderson Reporting Company

2

for this time or not? 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Generally, not.  Generally, 

3

not.  The  the unions have not been able to negotiate 

4

that.  It's the arrangement that  that I've just 

5

described.  And  and, of course, there are a large 

6

number of nonunionized plants, they have to pay for all 

7

this. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you happen to know why 

the government hasn't issued a regulation on this?  It 

10

seems the quintessential question of statutory 

11

interpretation to which we would normally defer to the 

12

agency. 

13

 Why hasn't  this is really a question to 

14

Mr. Yang, but do you just happen to know, given the 

15

history of all this and all this  these guidance 

16

documents, why they've never just like come to 

17

everybody's aid and issued a regulation? 

18

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I do not know, Your Honor. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Too complicated is why. 

20

 (Laughter.) 

21

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

22
23

25

If the Court has no further 

questions.
