Mr. Cole.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. COLE
ON BEHALF OF HUMANITARIAN LAW PROJECT, ET AL.
MR. COLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This as-applied challenge asks whether the

13

government can make it a crime for Ralph Fertig and the

14

Humanitarian Law Project to speak in association with

15

the Kurdistan Workers Party.

16

advocate for legal reform in Congress and the UN, to

17

write and distribute articles supportive of Kurdish

18

rights, to inform the Kurds of their international human

19

rights and remedies, and to advise them on peaceful

20

conflict resolution.

21

Kurdistan Workers Party engages in a wide range of

22

lawful activities and that plaintiffs seek to support

23

only lawful ends.

24
25

Specifically, they seek to

It is undisputed that the

The government has a concededly compelling
interest in combatting terrorism, yet it has not even

tried to defend these prohibitions under strict

2

scrutiny.

3

proposition that criminalizing plaintiffs' speech is a

4

regulation of conduct, not speech, and therefore can be

5

upheld under O'Brien.

6

Instead, it rests its entire case on the

That view is mistaken for two fundamental

7

reasons.

8

is inapplicable where the government prohibits pure

9

speech --

10
11

First, as this Court has already held, O'Brien

JUSTICE STEVENS:

agree that some of the speech could be regulated?

12

MR. COLE:

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

But, Mr. Cole, don't you

Some of my clients’ speech?
Some of the speech of your

client.

15

MR. COLE:

I don't think -- I don't think

16

any of it could be prohibited, Your Honor, unless the

17

government can satisfy the stringent scrutiny that this

18

Court applies when Congress seeks to prohibit pure

19

speech.

20
21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. COLE:

I think that certainly all of the

speech that I've just identified, which is the core -JUSTICE STEVENS:

issue is protected?

So, no, I don't -- I --

You identified quite a

bit.

1

MR. COLE:

Right.

Yes.

It’s core -- and

2

I think the reason, Your Honor, is it is core political

3

speech on issues of public concern.

4

only lawful, peaceable activities.

5

upheld the criminal prohibition of lawful speech on

6

issues of public concern.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It is advocating
This Court has never

Well, could the

8

government, I assume -- I assume you will say "yes" --

9

could the government forbid any NGO or other

10

organization or person from giving tsunami aid to one of

11

these organizations, from giving them money?

12
13

MR. COLE:
Honor.

14
15

I think money is different, Your

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could they -- could the

government prohibit that?

16

MR. COLE:

I think money is different

17

because it's -- it's conduct, not speech.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

Let's assume the

19

government could prohibit that.

20

is:

21

the terrorist organization how to get the tsunami aid?

22

Then the next question

Could the government prohibit speech instructing

MR. COLE:

Right.

And I think -- - I think,

23

Your Honor, that the answer is no, for the -- unless the

24

government can meet the higher standard of scrutiny that

25

applies when you’re regulating speech.

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. COLE:

3

would necessarily be Brandenburg.

4

order to apply -- to decide this case, Your Honor,

5

all the Court has to find is that when the speech

6

advocates solely lawful, peaceable activities of the

7

sort advocated here, that's not sufficient.

8

specific -- we've suggested a specific intent standard,

9

which is lower than Brandenburg, would be appropriate --

10

Brandenburg?

Well, I don't know whether it

I think for -- in

I think

But -- but if you get

11

tsunami money, that frees up your other assets for

12

terrorist money.

13

teaching how to get that money?

14

So why can't the government forbid

MR. COLE:

Well, again, Your Honor, that --

15

if the government -- if the connection between the

16

speech and the government's concern were sufficiently

17

close, then maybe it could.

18
19
20
21
22

But the problem --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why can't there

be -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then what's the test?

Is it -- you say it's not Brandenburg?
MR. COLE:

I think the test is whether the

23

-- whether the speech -- when it's speech, I think the

24

test is whether the speech has been provided with

25

specific intent or knowledge that it will further

2

CHIEF JUSTICE:

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if it goes -And that applies --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if it goes to

5

the mere existence of a group?

Let's say you have the

6

Nazi Party, and you are talking about advice or speech on

7

some purely mundane issue.

8

and you are giving them advice on how to run a

9

hospital, but the government decides that anything that

The Nazis have a hospital,

10

legitimizes the Nazi Party, you know, promotes that

11

group's terrorist activities.

12

that kind of determination?

13
14

Can the government make

I'm thinking of something like Regan v.

1

an example that doesn't implicate the particulars of

2

the issue today.

3

MR. COLE:

So I think -- the

4

reason I ask, Your Honor, is that it may make a

5

difference if we are at war.

14

MR. COLE:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

16

legitimizes it.

17

better.

18

the party, the group, will be legitimized.

19

It's going to make their hospital run

People are going to like their hospital.

MR. COLE:

Right.

So

Well, I think all the

20

Court held in Regan and Zemel was that it is permissible

21

for the government to regulate conduct -- not speech --

22

travel, and economic transactions, not speech.

23

were essentially O'Brien cases.

Those

24

And, in fact, in Regan the Court

25

distinguished a prohibition on travel to Cuba across the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

board from a prohibition directed at a group, the

2

Communist Party, in the Kent and Aptheker cases, where

3

the Court held that --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you can't travel

5

there -- suppose you want to travel there so that you can

6

meet with and discuss lawful activities with people

7

there.

8
9

If you can't get there, you can't speak.
MR. COLE:

That's right, Your Honor.

But

that -- but that's essentially an O'Brien situation.

10

The prohibition is on a conduct, whether it's

11

draft card burning or travel.

12

to engage in that conduct says, I want to do it for

13

speech purposes.

14

a freer hand in regulating conduct than speech, and,

15

therefore, as long as you’re regulating the

16

non-expressive element of the conduct, we'll apply

17

O'Brien.

18
19

22

But the Court says the government has

But what this Court has said is that when -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

stop you from meeting anywhere with the terrorists?

2

situation?

3

How would that be different than the Cuba

MR. COLE:

Well, then, if it's -- if it's

4

traveling for the purpose of association, then it would

5

be targeted at association, not at the conduct of

6

travel.

The whole --

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it's no different

than the Cuba situation.

9

MR. COLE:

No, but the whole point of the

10

Cuba -- the Cuba travel cases is that -- again, as this

11

Court said, it was an across-the-board ban.

12

apply to different political groups.

It applied to

13

anyone who sought to travel to Cuba.

And it was about

14

travel.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It did not

Well, suppose it's a ban

16

just for travel to meet with terrorist organizations,

17

Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical.

18

MR. COLE:

Right.

Well, then I think -- I

19

think that's -- that’s different from this case, right,

20

because this case -- suppose it's a ban on speech

21

wherever it

22
23
24
25

occurs.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what about the -- what

about the hypothetical?
MR. COLE:

Right.

Well, with respect to the

hypothetical, I think the question, Your Honor, would be
11
Alderson Reporting Company

1

whether the government's interest in banning that travel

2

is unrelated to the associational or speech purposes.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's what the Chief

4

Justice says:

5

inure to the benefit of a terrorist organization, and we

6

have a governmental interest in not allowing that.

7

In any context, support ultimately will

There's no -- there’s no dispute,

8

Your Honor, that the government has a compelling interest

9

in cutting off aid to terrorism.

10

it can do

The question is whether

so by criminalizing pure speech.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it hasn't criminalized

12

speech.

It has criminalized providing aid and

13

assistance to these organizations.

14

assistance that is prohibited is not in the form of

15

speech, but it happens to include speech as well.

16

MR. COLE:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Most of that aid and

Right, but, Justice Scalia -I think that’s quite

18

different from a law that is directed explicitly at

19

speech.

20

MR. COLE:

Well, I don’t -- I think it's not

21

in this -- in this sense, Justice Scalia.

22

statute that banned aid to overthrow the United States

23

Government.

24

assassinate the president; two, you can't provide bombs and

25

weapons to groups attempting to overthrow the government;

And it had three provisions:

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Imagine a

One, you can't

Official

1

three, you can't advocate overthrow of the government.

2

If that were applied to someone for speaking in advocacy,

3

we wouldn't say it's a regulation of speech.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's not the right --

5

that's not the right number three.

6

three is you cannot advise and assist an organization

7

that is seeking to overthrow the government.

8

what is at issue here, not --

9

MR. COLE:

10

The right number

That's

Well, but --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- not independently promoting

11

the objectives of these terrorist organizations.

12

your clients are free to do that.

13

MR. COLE:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your --

Well -But when they assist

15

the organization by providing advice, that's a different

16

matter.

17

MR. COLE:

Well, the government says if

18

they -- even if they speak in conjunction with the group,

19

they -- and they’re providing a benefit to the government,

20

that's prohibited.

21
22
23

So, for example --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

When they provide a

benefit, right?
MR. COLE:

So, for example, under that view,

24

the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the L.A. Times,

25

all of which published op-eds by Hamas spokespersons -13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Hamas is on the list -- thereby providing a benefit to

2

Hamas, working with the Hamas spokesperson, they’re all

3

criminals.

4

President Carter -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we -- we can cross

5

that bridge when we come to it.

6

MR. COLE:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -This is an as-applied

8

challenge, and we are talking about the kind of advice

9

and assistance that your clients want to give.

10
11

MR. COLE:
no --

12
13

Right, and, Your Honor, there's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not a New York Times

editorial.

14

MR. COLE:

Well, it is, though.

It is, Your

15

Honor.

16

Times, and he's not President Carter, but it's the same

17

sort of support, right?

18

I mean, it’s -- Ralph Fertig is not the New York

President Carter --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

No, no.

I thought

19

that he was -- he wants to meet with the people.

20

New York Times didn't meet with Hamas to tell them how

21

great their editorial was.

22

MR. COLE:

The

No, but it's not about -- it's

23

not about whether you meet with them.

24

whether you coordinate with them, and they've certainly

25

coordinated with the Hamas spokesperson in editing and
14
Alderson Reporting Company

It's about

Official

1

accepting and then publishing his editorial.

2

that would be providing a service.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"coordinating" means, doesn't it?

5

that in the next case.
MR. COLE:

It would --

It depends on what

4

6

That is --

And we can determine

Well, let me -- let me also

7

answer it this way, Justice Scalia:

If you look at the

8

specific speech which our clients seek to engage in, it

9

includes writing and distributing literature in

10

conjunction with the Kurdistan Workers Party in the

11

United States advocating their support.

12

different from the New York Times?

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

How is that

Supposing that -- what you

14

say is you want to engage in political advocacy on

15

behalf of the Kurds.

16

Suppose -- and these are two hypotheticals.

17

one, your clients, let's say, or some other people,

18

know that what the Kurds' hypothetical plan is, is to

19

pretend they're a political advocacy organization,

20

but to go around shooting the people who don't agree

21

with them.

22

knows it.

23

Okay?

That's your words.

All right.
Hypothetical

Case one, the hypothetical defendant

In case two, he doesn't know it, but it's true.
MR. COLE:

Well, I think -- I think if

24

you -- if you specifically intend and know that your aid

25

will further the group in its terrorist activities, then
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's not protected speech.

2

don't know that and you don't intend that, and in this

3

case --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if you're -- if you

And that goes for all forms of

5

training?

No form of training or expert assistance can

6

be prohibited unless the individual specifically intends

7

to further -- that the training will be used to carry

8

out terrorist activities?

9

MR. COLE:

10

as-applied challenge.

11

training in what international human rights consist of,

12

in how to advocate for international human rights, and

13

how to advocate politically in Congress and other bodies.

14

That's the speech that's at issue here.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Justice Alito, this is an
So the question simply is whether

Well, just out of curiosity,

16

I thought your position was that no form of training or

17

assistance could be prohibited -- -

18

MR. COLE:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20
21

Amendment.

No, I was just --- consistent with the First

That's not your position?
MR. COLE:

No.

I think -- I think, again,

22

it depends upon the form of speech.

23

of training that are so closely connected to the -- to

24

the end that Congress seeks to -- legitimately seeks to

25

proscribe, like training in bombmaking or training in
16
Alderson Reporting Company

There may be some forms

Official

1

military exercises.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The end that Congress seeks

3

to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist

4

organizations.

5

that when you aid any of their enterprises you’re

6

aiding the organization.

7

support among -- among the Palestinians by activities

8

that are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals,

9

all sorts of things.

10

MR. COLE:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the theory of the legislation is

Hamas, for example, gained

Right.
But that is what fosters the

12

terrorist organization and enables the terrorist

13

activities.

14

Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot

15

be separated from assistance to their terrorist

16

activities.

17

Why isn't that a reasonable connection?

MR. COLE:

Right.

Well, Your Honor,

18

that is precisely the argument that the United States

19

made to this Court in Scales.

20

from the government's brief:

21

proscribed even though the activity be expended along

22

lines not otherwise illegal, since active support of any

23

kind aids the organization in achieving its own illegal

24

purposes."

25

And here I’m quoting
"Active membership can be

4

overthrowing the United States by force and violence,

6

held you've got to distinguish between that aid and

7

support and membership which is furthering the lawful

8

activities and that which is furthering the illegal

9

10

lawful speech.

13

And, nonetheless, this Court in Scales

The Court said the same thing in De

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Cole, as I remember,

Scales upheld a conviction, wasn’t --

14

MR. COLE:

It did, Justice Ginsburg, but

15

only because it interpreted the statute to be -- to be

16

limited to specific -- to members -- active membership

17

that is specifically intended to further the illegal

18

ends of the group, precisely -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

But it didn’t -- it was not

20

21

support, and page 17 of your brief made -- this is a

22

difficult case for me.

23

this Court means that the case does not involve the

2

MR. COLE:

Right.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then you say:

"Nor does it

4

involve speech advocating or teaching criminal or violent

5

activity."

6
7

But it does involve speech, let's say arguendo,
that is tantamount to material support.

8

MR. COLE:

Well, I -- right, but --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the speech is

10

tantamount to material support in that it legitimizes,

11

encourages, or strengthens the organization.

Well, two things in response to

Well, Your Honor, in De Jonge,

6

one of these cases, one of this Court's first First

7

Amendment cases, the government argued that Mr. De Jonge

8

aided the Communist Party in its illegal ends by

9

conducting a meeting for them and being their lead

10

speaker at the meeting.

11

to look at what he did, and what -- yes, he conducted the

19

4

my answer to that would be it would depend upon whether

what is being prohibited is speech, I'm not sure that it

would be permissible for the government to say we’re

does it cover personnel that -- a nurse at one of the --

3

MR. COLE:

Right.

Our argument, Your Honor,

4

is -- again, this is an as-applied challenge with respect to

the particular speech that our clients seek to engage in,

MR. COLE:

-- was whether there was

a way in your challenge, or whether you are advocating

19

any difference in the nature of the speech, that it's --

MR. COLE:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's --

And so the question --

because the only answer you have given us is if it's

24

lawful speech, it's protected.

25

MR. COLE:

and under what analytical framework would we reach it?

question at the -- at the -- at the bottom would be

whether there is a sufficient connection between the

Justice Kennedy, I want

first -- I’m going to answer your question, and I’m

going to say that that's still not covered, but I want

7

also to make a general point, which is that this Court

8

can exhaust all the hypotheticals that it has in this

10

that would be so for two reasons.

11

First, because with respect to overbreadth,

12

all of those uncertain or even unconstitutional

13

applications will be but a thimbleful, compared to the

14

ocean full of completely legitimate applications of this

15

nothing to do with this case.

17

And, second, because those hypotheticals have

Mr. Cole said several times, I heard, this

18

is an as-applied challenge, this is an as-applied

19

challenge.

20

there are certain categories of activity that the

21

statute could not prohibit that would raise serious

22

constitutional concerns -- which I must say I -- I

23

disagree with, but there may be some.

24

Now focusing on those two things, and going

10

back to Justice Sotomayor's question, why -- what is the

That's what they

Therefore there is a First Amendment interest

Now, when that is seriously implicated,

19

there is also a government interest, on the other side,

20

in not having terrorism.

21

restrictive alternative which they suggest, that in that

22

situation, what they're entitled to read this statute as

23

saying is that, if they believe and a person reasonably

would believe that their teaching, assistance,

training, would not significantly aid this organization

not accepting that interpretation?

describe as -- and what I have narrowed -- a less

restrictive way of going about it.

objection is exactly what Justice Kennedy suggested with

his hypothetical, because his hypothetical is actually

perfectly aligned with this case.

You can't give

13

tsunami aid, but the question is:

Can you instruct

14

these organizations about how to get tsunami aid?

aid, and they, in fact, use that aid in such a way that

that the First Amendment protects.

GENERAL KAGAN:

Congress was the reasonable

That's the entire theory behind this

JUSTICE ALITO:

And doesn't that lead to --

kind of logically lead to the conclusion that mere

23

membership could be prohibited?

someone could be a member of one of these organizations

25

without providing a service to the organization?

Could you explain how

6

If you attended a meeting and

GENERAL KAGAN:

I -- I actually don't

include that.

9

Congress used make that pretty clear.

And I think that the normal words that
When you think

about personnel, when you think about training, when you

11

think about expert advice and assistance, even when you

12

think about service, you -- the notion that I am serving

13

a terrorist organization simply by the act of membership

14

I think would not be correct.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -Why do you say Congress

16

clearly did not intend that?

17

guessed that you are providing a service or personnel

18

when you make yourself a member of the organization.

GENERAL KAGAN:

You know, I would have

That is certainly not the

21

way the government reads the statute, and that's not the

22

way the government has ever read the statute.

23

indeed, the government, as we discussed in our brief,

24

believes that there are certain kinds of joint

25

activities that would be allowed by the statute.

And,

Now, that's not to say that Congress could

2

not have gone farther.

3

4

it's possible that Congress could have gone further.

5

But we understand the statute and -- and I think there's

6

a -- I think, quite reasonably, as providing only

7

material support, a true service, something that will

8

help the foreign organization in whatever it does.

9

In this specific context, where

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but petitioning the

10

United Nations -- and that's what you are teaching them

12

that reasonably you would think was going to aid them in

their unlawful objectives, but for the realm of ideas.

14

Now --

And I think you are exactly

right about that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And is there any evidence that

something like that would, in fact, but for the realm of

ideas, help this organization commit its terrorist acts?

25

GENERAL KAGAN:

Justice Breyer, I believe
42

that the legislative record is quite clear that Congress

2

thought that various kinds of aid given to the legal and

3

legitimate activities of the terrorist organization, in

fact, further the aims of the -- in fact, further the

5

illegal and illegitimate goals.

6

Congress made findings about the fungibility

7

of these resources.

illegitimate activities by freeing up personnel and all

merely a congressional finding that any training is bad.

the congressional definition of what kind of training

of the hypothetical at all, Justice Sotomayor, because I

think you’re raising an important point, but it's

really a point that goes to how to sensibly read a

25

statute.

What Congress did, when in response to some
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lower court decisions, it further clarified and defined

2

the word “training” and the word “expert advice and

3

assistance,” I have to say I think that Congress's own

4

responses here -- I mean, they -- Congress was both

5

responsive and responsible, that it really took into

6

account court decisions and tried to go back to the

7

statute and --

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

they do -- want to hire a lawyer.

13

saying Congress has forbidden that in this statute,

15

and that's constitutional?

16

GENERAL KAGAN:

And this lawyer is supposed
You’re

Well, first of all,

17

Justice Breyer, I want to sort of repeat the -- what I

18

-- what I said about the need to find a substantial amount

19

of uncertain or unconstitutional applications, or with

20

respect to any kind of facial challenge or with respect

21

to this challenge --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I want to know if that's

23

what you’re saying, what I just said:

24

organization has American citizens, engages in

25

terrible stuff, but they are not entitled under the

50
Alderson Reporting Company

that an

Official

1

Constitution to have a lawyer in the United States who

2

does legal work like filing amicus briefs.

3

GENERAL KAGAN:

To the extent that there is

4

any constitutional claim that they would be entitled to

5

representation, whether it's a Sixth Amendment claim or

6

a due process claim that might exist in criminal cases,

7

that might exist in habeas cases, that might exist in

8

civil cases, then the government believes that the

9

statute should be read so as not to include that.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do these hypotheticals

11

make any difference?

12

We should look to the activities that this organization

13

wants to conduct, unless -- unless you think that there

14

is an overbreadth problem.

16

This is an as-applied challenge.

Clearly, the -- the broad scope of this

speech it may run afoul of are -- are minimal.

The court of appeals specifically said it's not vague

on its face, and there is no facial vagueness claim here,

Of course, that's a

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But in essence, this is an

action to enjoin a potential prosecution against

MR. COLE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I want to start by addressing the question

4

of strict scrutiny.

7

wide range of conduct and just some of that is speech?

description of the breach of the peace statute in Cohen

11

12

through any kind of offensive conduct.

13

California applied that statute to the words on Mr.

14

Cohen's jacket and then argued because we are not

15

interested in the words on his jacket, we are interested

16

in preserving the peace, however it’s breached, O'Brien

MR. COLE:

No.

Well, the government doesn't

2

object because there are actually many cases, and FEC v.

3

Wisconsin Right to Life is only the most recent.

4

again, the notion is somebody who is told you can meet

5

with a group, you can discuss with a group -- in fact,

6

the House report says that you are free to speak with

7

and on behalf of a designated group.

But,

8

But then you have a statute that says, if

9

you advocate in any coordinated way, if you tell them

10

anything that’s derived from specialized knowledge, if

11

you tell them anything of specific skill, you're --

12

you're engaged in a crime and you could go to jail for

13

15 years.

14

That's why the Humanitarian Law Project came

The government has spent a decade arguing

that our clients cannot advocate for peace, cannot

inform about international human rights.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

remains of your case?

24

MR. COLE:

25

If O'Brien applies, what

If O'Brien applies, then I think

the Court would still be applying the scrutiny that
60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

asks, is there a reasonable fit -- is there a reasonable

2

fit between the specific speech that's at issue here,

3

speech on issues of public concern, advocating only

4

lawful activity, and the -- and that the government

5

legitimately seeks to further, which is stopping support

6

for terrorism?

7

Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That analysis of the

8

activities that you are proposing has not been done by

9

the lower courts, correct?

10

MR. COLE:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

Well, the lower courts struck -They -- they haven't --

they struck it on vagueness grounds, but none --

13

MR. COLE:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

The --- none of the courts

15

either subjected this to strict scrutiny or the

16

reasonable fit --

17

MR. COLE:

No, and, in fact, the government

18

has never even attempted to defend the statute under strict

19

scrutiny, because I think it clearly could not satisfy

20

strict scrutiny.

21

scrutiny is what must be applied here.

22

In addition --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And under this -- under Cohen, strict

Well, why don't -- why

24

don't we remand it to the lower courts to apply strict

25

scrutiny if we agree with you that O'Brien doesn't apply

here?

2

MR. COLE:

I think it would be appropriate

3

to remand for -- for application of strict scrutiny if

4

you read it that O'Brien doesn't apply.

5

O'Brien also doesn't apply if the statute is

6

not content neutral.

7

all aid; it doesn't even bar all speech.

8

unlimited provision of religious materials, even if they

9

advocate jihad, but proscribes any secular material, even

10

This is a statute that doesn't bar

if they are advocating peace.

11

So -- so there are -- the -- the lower

12

court, again, found that the statute was vague, that our

13

clients were reasonably chilled, that they had a right

14

to engage in this activity.

15

result either through vagueness, or you can reach it by

16

applying strict scrutiny, or I think because the fit is

17

so poor here, and because -- and the vagueness, in fact,

18

undermines the fit, because people are chilled from

19

engaging even in speech that the government doesn't want

20

to prohibit.

I think you can reach that

All right, if I am told you -- you -- you’ll

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Cole, there were

congressional findings that money is fungible first for

terrorist groups, like -- that if you give them money for

2

legitimate means, that it's going to be siphoned off and

3

used for illegitimate means.

4

MR. COLE:

Right.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, why isn't that enough,

6

either under strict scrutiny or a lesser standard,

7

reasonable fit standard, to say that you can't teach

8

these groups how to get money?

9

MR. COLE:

Right.

Well, one -- well, we’re not

10

-- we’re not teaching them how to get money.

11

to teach them how to advocate for lawful human rights

12

or --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We’re seeking

No, one of your -- one

14

of your stated aims, at least of one of the groups is to

15

teach them how to get aid for tsunami relief.

16

MR. COLE:

Right.

That -- that claim has

17

been mooted because the LTTE is no longer -- has no role

18

in Sri Lanka.

19

to do with money.

20

So what’s left is solely -- has nothing

Secondly, Congress only made a finding about

21

money.

At the same time that it made a finding that

22

money is fungible, it said this is a statute -- and

23

this is from the House report -- only affects one’s

24

contribution of financial and material resources and

25

does not prohibit speaking in concert with and on behalf

Well, that suggests that Congress thought

3

that what our clients want to do is -- should be protected.
