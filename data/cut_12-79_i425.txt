 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (11:06 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument next this morning in Case 1279, Chadbourne & 

5

Parke v. Troice in the consolidated cases. 

6

 Mr. Clement. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

8
9
10
11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The Stanford Ponzi scheme was a massive 

12

fraud, but that fraud clearly included material 

13

misrepresentations about transactions in covered 

14

securities.  The complaints in this case bear that out. 

15

 Plaintiffs allege specifically that their 

16

money was  there were misrepresentations about how 

17

their money would be invested in covered securities, 

18

that the misrepresentation was material, and that, 

19

indeed, the security of the underlying investments was 

20

the most important factor in securing Plaintiff's own 

21

investments in the CDs. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

, I  I think there's 

23

some problem with whether or not this was covered 

24

securities, but I also think that's not in the case 

25

anymore.  Am I correct in the latter assumption?

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I certainly agree with 

2

you in the latter assumption, Your Honor, which is both 

3

lower courts decided this on the case that the complaint 

4

specifically  referred to covered securities 

5

specifically enough. 

6

 I don't want to belabor the point because I 

7

don't think it's in the case, but I will say I do think 

8

there's a reason that that was not a contested issue 

9

because, if you think about the securities that were 

10

referred to, strong multinational corporations, major 

11

international banks, those are companies that are traded 

12

on U.S. national exchanges. 

13

 Also, if you get into the details of the 

14

record, I mean,  if you want to look at 

15

something, Joint Appendix page 746 is an attachment to 

16

the Willis complaint.  And there, there's a reference to 

17

the New York Stock Exchange, and it's a translated 

18

letter to investors, and you can read it more than one 

19

way. 

20

 But I sure think the whole point of that 

21

paragraph is to lead the Plaintiffs to think that their 

22

stocks  they're buying an interest in stocks that would 

23

be traded on the New York Stock Exchange particularly. 

24

So 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

5

Alderson Reporting Company

So if  if I'm

Official

1

trying to get a home loan and they ask you what assets 

2

you have and I list a couple of stocks, and, in fact, 

3

it's fraudulent, I don't own them, that's a covered 

4

transaction, that's a 10b5 violation? 

5

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I don't know, Mr. Chief 

6

Justice.  That would depend on the answer to a question 

7

that I don't think the Court has to decide in this case, 

8

which is whether a reference to your stockholdings would 

9

be sufficient to  to come with 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, suppose you say you're 

11

going to pay off the loan by selling some stock 

12

holdings, eventually. 

13

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Yeah, I think that probably 

14

would be covered, Your Honor, and I don't think that's 

15

any great surprise.  I mean, this Court held in a case 

16

called Reuben against the United States that, if you 

17

pledge securities that are  and tell the bank that 

18

they're valuable and they, in fact, aren't, that that's 

19

covered by the securities law. 

20

 In that case, it wasn't just in connection 

21

with, it was actually considered a constructive sale or 

22

transfer of the securities. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If they were covered 

24

securities, right?  I mean, you're  you're pledging 

25

covered securities to the bank and make a

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

misrepresentation about them, right? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, that's right.  I'm just 

3

saying, though, that I don't think the fact that you can 

4

have a misrepresentation in connection with a loan 

5

application or something like that is all that 

6

surprising in the sense that the way that both 10b, 

7

10b5, and SLUSA are structured. 

8
9

 The "in connection with" requirement can 
take something that might otherwise be plain fraud, and 

10

if there's a misrepresentation in connection with a 

11

security or a covered security, that makes it securities 

12

fraud.  But that 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

My goodness.  Are there 

14

cases where they brought such things?  I mean, every 

15

State has laws that forbid fraud.  And mortgages are 

16

probably  and loans are probably made in the billions 

17

every year.  All it takes is someone to say, on his 

18

sheet of listing assets, to have a covered security and 

19

say, don't worry, I'll hold these, I'll hold them. 

20

 Or don't worry, I will sell this one and buy 

21

that one.  Don't worry, I'll buy another one.  I 

22

won't  I won't put up the security of my sprinkler 

23

system.  I will sell the sprinkler system and use it to 

24

buy a  a covered exchange. 

25

 I guess if those fall within the securities

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

laws, we would have expected to see billions of actions. 

2

Why not? 

3

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, with  with respect, I 

4

don't think, in most of these cases, anything is going 

5

to particularly turn on that.  I also think  I'm happy 

6

to answer 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I know that's what you 

8

think, but I need to know why you think it.  If there 

9

are billion  if I'm right in my  what I just said. 

10

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Because there are lots of 

11

cases where whether you can prosecute a fraud or 

12

securities fraud is not going to make much difference. 

13

You can go at it either way.  There are circumstances 

14

there are really two things that are at issue here.  One 

15

is 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Tell me a case where the 

17

SEC has ever  there may be such cases  but what is 

18

done is somebody  simply tried to get a loan and he 

19

put on that sheet of paper listing assets a covered 

20

security.  And he said, I intend to keep it.  Or he 

21

said  you know, I will buy some more, or I'll sell it 

22

and buy some more or  you know, or put in your three 

23

things. 

24
25

 Just list the case where they've ever 
prosecuted that as a securities fraud or private people

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have.  After all, it's beneficial, sometimes, for 

2

private people.  What are the cases? 

3

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Your Honor, I don't know that 

4

there are cases directly on point.  But let me be clear. 

5

Our theory here does not, by any means, necessarily have 

6

to extend to those holder situations.  What is at issue 

7

here is not just a misrepresentation about holdings of 

8

securities.  It is  they are misrepresentations about 

9

covered securities transactions. 

10

 And more particularly, they are false 

11

promises to purchase covered securities for Plaintiffs' 

12

benefit.  And there are SEC cases that are brought under 

13

those circumstances and, as well, there should be 

14

because, when you sell something, whether it's a 

15

noncovered security or something else based on a 

16

misrepresentation about covered securities, you trigger 

17

the interests of the SEC and SLUSA in a distinct way. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 Suppose two people reach a 

19

prenuptial agreement, and as part of the prenuptial 

20

agreement, they agree that, in a year, one party to the 

21

marriage is going to sell as many shares of Google stock 

22

and buy a home with it.  Is that covered by the 

23

securities laws now? 

24
25

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I would think probably not, at 

the end of the day, but I also would say that this is so

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

far removed from that.  I mean, first of all 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, how is it removed from 

3

that?  Because it has the same structural features, 

4

which is it's a misrepresentation about what you're 

5

going to do with securities, but, in fact, does not 

6

affect any securities trading.  What it affects is a 

7

decision to do something else, here, to buy CDs or, in 

8

my example, to go get married. 

9

 MR. CLEMENT: 

With respect, Your Honor, I 

10

think this Court has already crossed the bridge that you 

11

don't have to effect the specific transaction in which 

12

you are  the fraud is alleged to be associated with. 

13

So you have cases like O'Hagan, for example, where the 

14

actual transaction on the  on the exchange is not 

15

sullied with the fraud and the victim of the fraud 

16

doesn't even trade, the holder of the confidential 

17

information 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

In all of our cases, there's 

19

been something to say when somebody can ask the 

20

question, how has this affected a potential purchaser or 

21

seller in the market for the relevant securities?  And 

22

here, there's nothing to say. 

23
24
25

 MR. CLEMENT: 

With respect, I disagree with 

the premise.  I don't think 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Somebody, not necessarily

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the victim of the fraud, but somebody has to have had 

2

some transaction in the market.  It's the kind of 

3

misrepresentation that would affect someone in making 

4

transactions in the covered market.  How would this do 

5

that? 

6

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, the only way in which 

7

there isn't that kind of transaction here is because the 

8

fraud was bigger.  As we point out in the briefs, if you 

9

imagine that this was a thing where they said, look, 

10

we're going to purchase multinational corporations; and, 

11

instead, they purchase domestic corporations. 

12

 Well, then, there would be a transaction 

13

that would not have otherwise occurred on the market and 

14

domestic transactions that would have been perfectly 

15

analogous to the kind of normal transaction that took 

16

place in Bankers Life or in Zandford on the market. 

17

And yet, the fraud was sufficiently associated with this. 

18

 And I don't think this Court wants to say 

19

that the only frauds that are not in connection with are 

20

the really big ones 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, what is the case? 

22

What is the specific case, private or SEC, that comes 

23

the closest  I grant you there is none direct  but 

24

comes the closest to Justice Kagan's hypothetical, if 

25

you marry me, I will sell my IBM stock?

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I don't think there's a 

2

particularly close case because, A, I think the SEC has 

3

better things to do. 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

 MR. CLEMENT: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Try 
And I think privately 
What is the SEC's closest 

7

case  but they may be better at answering this.  What 

8

is their closest case to the horribles that they foresee 

9

if you lose? 

10

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I  I think, probably, 

11

I would start with the Richard Line case, which is cited 

12

on page 21 of their brief.  And what that case shows is 

13

that you can have frauds in connection with covered 

14

securities that affect things that are either not 

15

covered securities or, in that case, are nothing at all. 

16

 Mr. Line was very clever. 

He took people 

17

who were interested in having their kids go to college 

18

and needed financial aid, and he said, I'll take your 

19

assets from you, and they'll be  they'll be mine, I'm 

20

not going to give you anything in return, not a covered 

21

security, nothing, because the whole point of this is to 

22

get your assets off your books. 

23

 And what I'll do is I'll invest those in the 

24

market, make a bunch of money, and in four years, when 

25

you're no longer worried about financial aid, I'll

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

return your principal and some of the proceeds.  And 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, in Justice  Justice 

3

Kagan's hypothetical and in some of the others, it seems 

4

that it's really irrelevant in whether the assets in 

5

question are securities or some other asset.  And it's 

6

also  and, therefore, a fortiori, it's irrelevant 

7

whether  if it involves securities, whether they're 

8

covered or they're not covered. 

9

 Now, would you be willing to concede that, 

10

in that situation, where it really  all you're talking 

11

about is an asset.  It doesn't matter whether it's a 

12

covered security or a  a Rembrandt or gold, that, in 

13

that situation, 10(b) doesn't reach the case? 

14

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I think that  I would agree 

15

with that, Justice Alito, but for a slightly different 

16

reason than you may be imagining, which is I think one 

17

of the mistakes that can be made here is to ask in 

18

connection with 

19

has multiple requirements, including a materiality 

20

requirement. 

21

do all the work.  And the statute 

 And as your question suggests, if you're 

22

making a misrepresentation and the whole point of it is 

23

to just tell somebody that, look, I have wealth, or I 

24

have sort of assets, I don't know that the specific 

25

nature of them makes any difference.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But in a case like this, the whole point of 

2

this fraud was to take a noncovered security and to 

3

imbue it with some of the positive qualities of a 

4

covered security, the most important of which being 

5

liquidity.  And if you look at sort of the underlying 

6

brochures here that were used to market this, that's 

7

really what this fraud was all about. 

8
9
10
11

 These  these CDs were offered as being 
better than normal CDs because we can get you your money 
whenever you need it. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Does it matter that there 

12

apparently, there is not an allegation that there 

13

actually were any purchases or sales of covered 

14

securities?  It says in  the statute says, "in 

15

connection with the purchase or sale of a covered 

16

security."  And there weren't. 

17

 There  I don't believe there's an 

18

allegation that they actually were purchased or sold. 

19

Does that matter? 

20

 MR. CLEMENT: 

It doesn't matter, Your Honor, 

21

for the reason I indicated earlier, which is you don't 

22

want to draw a line that basically says, look, if you 

23

buy different securities than you were supposed to or 

24

you sell fewer than you were supposed to, that's 

25

covered, but if you're a Madoff, and you go all the way

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and simply lie about the whole thing and there never 

2

were any securities purchases at all, that that's 

3

somehow better. 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What's your best case on 

that? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I think, again, if  if 

7

you want to start with SEC adjudications, again, on page 

8

21, there is the Jett adjudication where, again, there 

9

was a broker/dealer in that case, and they just made up 

10

the trades.  They told their employer, you know, look 

11

how I've done, look at these great trades.  And there 

12

just weren't any trades. 

13

 And of course, all of the Madoff cases  or 

14

a substantial number of Madoff cases fit that  fit 

15

that  that categorization.  It's actually not clear 

16

whether this case does because, at the end of the day, I 

17

think what's alleged is either there were no purchases 

18

or substantially less purchases of covered securities 

19

than represented. 

20

 Nobody has really thought the difference 

21

between zero and substantially less made much of a 

22

difference in this case.  And I would certainly, like I 

23

said, suggest that that's the right result because, 

24

whatever else is true, you can't somehow have a better 

25

fraud that's immune from the SEC, just because you

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

completely made the whole thing up and there were no 

2

transactions at all. 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr.  Mr. Clement, there 

4

are  Zandford said that "in connection with" doesn't 

5

include every common law fraud that happens to involve 

6

covered securities.  So can you give us an example of 

7

what would not be covered?  What fraud involving 

8

securities would not qualify as in connection with the 

9

sale or purchase of securities? 

10

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Sure.  Let me start with  I 

11

mean  with a hypothetical that Zandford used because I 

12

think it helps illustrate why, even if coincide is the 

13

test, we satisfied here.  What Zandford was really 

14

distinguishing is two cases, one where a broker/dealer 

15

gets money from a potential client with the purest of 

16

intentions and only at a later stage do they say  you 

17

know, I'm kind of below on own payments, I need some 

18

money, I'm going to embezzle the funds. 

19

 And Zandford said, in that context, the 

20

fraud and the security purchases are independent events. 

21

I don't think anybody would look at this case and say 

22

that the misrepresentations about covered securities 

23

purchases and the fraud were independent events, nor 

24

would anybody say that this isn't a case where, from the 

25

very beginning, there was intent by Stanford not to make

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

good on the promise to purchase covered securities on 

2

behalf of the plaintiffs. 

3

 So this is like Zandford itself or Wharf 

4

Wharf Holdings itself, where the fraudulent intent is 

5

there at the very moment the transaction takes place. 

6

And, again, Wharf Holdings is another example where this 

7

Court says, in dictum, that, well  you know, it would 

8

be one thing if they sold the option and only, later, 

9

independently decided that they weren't going to perform 

10
11
12
13

on the option. 
 But if they had that intent all along, they 
clearly coincide.  Now 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I had assumed that the 

14

purpose of the securities laws was to protect the 

15

purchasers and sellers of the covered securities.  There 

16

is no purchaser or cover  or seller of a covered 

17

security involved here. 

18

 MR. CLEMENT: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, there 
It's  it's a purchaser of 

20

not  notcovered securities who is being defrauded, if 

21

anyone.  Why  why would the Federal securities law 

22

protect that person? 

23

 MR. CLEMENT: 

A couple things, Your Honor. 

24

First of all, obviously, the Federal securities laws 

25

apply to noncovered securities, as well as covered

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

securities.  So the real question here is going to be 

2

SLUSA's coverage because, as I said, 10b5 applies to 

3

noncovered securities. 

4

 Second of all, this Court is well over the 

5

bridge about not requiring that it be the plaintiff's 

6

own purchases or sales that are what the inquiry focuses 

7

on.  And that's been true in a whole line of this 

8

Court's cases.  And in

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It doesn't have to be the 

plaintiff's, but it has to be somebody's. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, and here, there are 

12

purchases of covered securities.  They're the alleged 

13

purchases.  They're the false promises that I'm going 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Nonexistent purchases, 

right? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, as I said, I don't think 

17

anything turns on it, but there actually were some 

18

purchases.  And they 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The only element of 

20

fraud in there was by the bank itself.  They're the only 

21

ones whose purchases or sales could be said to have been 

22

affected by the misrepresentation.  And of course, they 

23

can't 

24

 MR. CLEMENT: 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right, but 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

 make any claim on

Official

1
2

that basis. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Right, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

3

that has been the case in other cases as well.  The 

4

security transactions in Bankers Life, neither the 

5

seller nor the buyer of those transactions had  was 

6

affected by  directly by the fraud.  In Zandford, 

7

there were security sales.  Those security sales 

8
9
10
11
12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But somebody else 

somebody else was, right? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Sure, and  and the 

plaintiffs were clearly affected by this fraud. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Not by the purchase 

13

or sale, right?  They were affected, according to your 

14

theory, by the fact that, oh, they told us there were 

15

these stocks, but the actual purchases and sales, the 

16

fraud did not go to the purchase and sales of the 

17

covered securities; they went to the CDs. 

18

 MR. CLEMENT: 

And, again, that's true, in so 

19

many of the cases.  Dabit, the holders didn't purchase or sell 

20

at all, but that was okay.  O'Hagan, the defrauded party 

21

was the company with the confidential information. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Your white light is on, 

23

but what is the simplest formulation of your test? 

24

If  if we were to write the opinion your way, what 

25

the test would be?

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CLEMENT: 

The simplest  the simplest, 

2

narrowest way to decide this case is to say that, when 

3

there is a misrepresentation and a false promise to 

4

purchase covered securities for the benefit of the 

5

plaintiffs, then the "in connection with" standard is 

6

required. 

7

 If I may reserve my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Ms. Goldenberg. 

Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG, 

11

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

12
13
14
15

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 
 We agree with the narrow formulation that 

16

Mr. Clement just gave, that the issue in this case is 

17

that it involves a false promise to purchase covered 

18

securities using the fraud victims' money in a way that 

19

they are told is going to benefit them and that that is 

20

a classic securities fraud.  Their question 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So how  how broad is 

22

the word "benefit"?  Because that's really what this 

23

case comes down to. 

24

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I think 
Assuming we accepted

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

your narrow test, which wouldn't address every situation 

2

that the other circuits have talked about, but let's 

3

let's 

4

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I think it's clear that 

5

"benefit" isn't restricted merely to ownership of the 

6

securities themselves, and I would point to 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that was the 

Madoff situation, which was different from this one. 
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, I don't think the 

10

Madoff situation is particularly different from this 

11

one.  In Madoff, there were feeder funds that people 

12

were buying into that were noncovered securities. 

13

 And what they were being told is that the 

14

money that was being put into the feeder fund was then 

15

going to go on and be used to purchase covered 

16

securities that they, themselves, were not going to have 

17

an ownership interest in, but that the benefit of those 

18

purchases was going to be passed back to them through 

19

this intermediate layer. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But  but the  the case 

21

that he said  I'm quite interested in your reaction to 

22

which cases that you've ever brought, this would, if you 

23

lose here, would prevent you from bringing, and Line was 

24

the one that was mentioned. 

25

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Yes.

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And in Line, there is a 

2

broker who says to a client, give me some money and I 

3

will buy some securities on the exchange for you.  And 

4

they gave him the money, and he didn't.  Well, that's 

5

directly related to a promise that is going to effect a 

6

purchase or sale of a security directly.  He's promising 

7

someone to buy securities for his account. 

8

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I actually 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't think that that's 

10
11

this case. 
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, I actually think that 

12

the Line case is much more analogous to this case than 

13

Your Honor is suggesting because what was happening in 

14

Line is the  what the broker said to the victims was, 

15

you have children who are going to college, you don't 

16

want to have this money around because you want to be 

17

able to get financial aid, so give the money to me, and 

18

in several years, I will give that money back to you 

19

with 

20
21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

He didn't say, I will buy 

them for you. 

22

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And I can understand how a 

24

promise to buy securities for you is a promise to a 

25

person or a statement that would lead a person to take a

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position.  Whether it's this plaintiff or someone in the 

2

world, it would lead someone in the world to take a 

3

position. 

4

 What your opponents say is that is what is 

5

present  not present here; neither the person who is 

6

giving the money nor anyone else, with the possible 

7

exception of the defendant, is being led by this 

8

statement to take a position in a market for, buy, 

9

against, sell, or even, if you like, not sell or buy, 

10

hold.  I'll throw that in. 

11

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Your Honor, the  just to 

12

return to Line for a moment, and then I'd like to 

13

address sort of how the purposes of the securities laws 

14

are implicated in a situation like this, in Line, what 

15

the victims were told was that they were going to be 

16

given the money back after four years had passed, with 

17

interest calculated above market rate. 

18

 So they are not being told that they were 

19

going to be given whatever profit is made on a 

20

securities transaction, or, as I read Line, although 

21

it's slightly sparse on its facts, that they're going to 

22

be the owners of the securities or have an ownership 

23

interest in any way.  And so I do think it is cases like 

24

Line that are at the margin 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Anyway, Line's not a case

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of ours, is it? 

2

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

No, it's not, Your Honor. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's not a case of any 

4

court, is it? 

5

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

It is an SEC 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's one of your cases. 

7

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Yes. 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right.  We don't have to 

9

agree with all of your cases, do we? 

10

 (Laughter.) 

11

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Certainly not, although we 

12

do think that the SEC's expert view in a formal 

13

adjudication may warrant some deference.  But 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So, Ms. Goldenberg, suppose 

15

I think that the correct test is something along the 

16

lines of what Justice Breyer just said, is  is this 

17

the kind of representation that could affect somebody's 

18

It doesn't have to be the victim of the fraud, it can be 

19

somebody else, but that could affect somebody's decision 

20

to buy or sell or hold covered securities. 

21

 Can you satisfy that test? 

22

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Yes, I think so because I 

23

think that, here, there is a major effect on investor 

24

confidence and investor confidence specifically with 

25

respect to covered securities in several different ways.

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 If people see that lies of the kind here, 

2

where someone is telling someone else, I'm going to buy 

3

covered securities, and it's going to benefit you, are 

4

being made and those lies are  are  well, that's a 

5

fraud on the victims, then I think people are less 

6

likely to go to their broker and say, here's some money, 

7

go out on the market, and buy me some securities. 

8
9

 It's a  it's a lie that goes to the 
mechanism by which the securities markets operate, which 

10

is the purchases and sales, and it makes it less likely 

11

for people to be willing to believe that, when they 

12

engage in purchases and sales, that something's really 

13

is going to happen, and the person is going to 

14

respond 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I mean, if you  if 

16

you went to church and heard a sermon that there are 

17

lots of people that are evil, maybe then you wouldn't 

18

invest, but I'm 

19

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, but this is much more 

20

particular, again, to the mechanism by which the 

21

securities markets operate.  And I think another way to 

22

look at it is just to imagine the honest version of 

23

Stanford. 

24
25

 If someone honestly said to CD purchasers, 
give me your money, and I'm going to put it into covered

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

securities, and people invested in that scheme, then 

2

that would pump money into the covered securities 

3

markets. 

4
5
6

 But now, people are much less likely to 
invest in a scheme like that. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well  but nobody 

7

is suggesting that the SEC can't take action with 

8

respect to the noncovered securities.  So to the extent 

9

there's diminished confidence in the securities markets, 

10

the SEC has all the tools available to address that. 

11

The question is the different one under SLUSA. 

12

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, I think it's true 

13

that the SEC would continue to have tools, but I do 

14

think 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I mean, in fact, 

16

I  this  it would inspire confidence to the extent 

17

that lawyers can bring these actions, as opposed to 

18

having them precluded, which is what you're arguing for. 

19

I'm sorry I interrupted you. 

20

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well  no, that's fine.  I 

21

think that this is a very particular effect on investor 

22

confidence and the integrity of the markets, which is 

23

one of the purposes of the securities laws. 

24

 And with respect to SLUSA, the purpose of 

25

SLUSA is to try to stop people from going around the

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

requirements of the PSLRA and some of the limitations in 

2

this Court's decisions, and I think that purpose is 

3

is at issue here as well. 

4

 I'd also like to talk a little bit, if I 

5

could, about the issue that was raised earlier about 

6

whether an actual purchase or sale needed to be made, or 

7

whether a purported or intended purchase or sale is 

8

sufficient. 

9

 And I think that, practically, from the 

10

moment that the '33 and '34 Act went into place, there's 

11

been a consensus in the lower courts  and the SEC has 

12

said this as well  that a purported or intended 

13

purchase or sale is sufficient. 

14

 And it's for the reason that Mr. Clement 

15

gave that, otherwise, you have these home run, egregious 

16

frauds, where someone is, instead of saying I'm going to 

17

buy this less risky thing and then buying a riskier 

18

thing, someone says, I'm going to buy securities, and 

19

then doesn't buy them at all and absconds with the 

20

money, and that that is something  a situation that 

21

has to be  has to be covered. 

22
23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Can I take you back to the 

test that you think we should apply here? 

24

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Sure. 
The test that Mr. Clement

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

articulated and that you agreed with seems to amount 

2

to  to saying, when exactly what is alleged here is 

3

alleged, that that's  that that's within 10b or 10b5, 

4

that's not that helpful as a precedent going forward. 

5

 Now, the test that Justice Breyer suggested, 

6

whether something would affect investors' confidence in 

7

the securities market, I don't know how we can  and 

8

you say, yes, this would  that would be met here  I 

9

don't know how we can determine what  whether 

10

something, certainly, of this nature or maybe even 

11

further removed, would, in effect  would affect 

12

investor confidence. 

13

 Somebody might read about this scheme in the 

14

paper and say, well  you know, there's a lot of hanky 

15

panky going on with the sale of any kind of securities 

16

and CDs, I'm just going to keep cash under my mattress. 

17

How do we  how would we determine that? 

18

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, I  I think it's for 

19

the reasons that I gave earlier, which is that this goes 

20

to the purchase/sale mechanism and that we know that 

21

people have to have confidence in that order  in order 

22

for the securities markets to work. 

23

 It may well be that people also  you know, 

24

lack confidence in other things, but that is the thing 

25

that's the particular problem and the thing that the

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

securities laws are aimed at.  And I know Petitioner 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What  what troubles me, 

3

Ms. Goldenberg, is not the problem of our figuring out 

4

these economic consequences, but the text of the 

5

statute, which says, "in connection with the purchase or 

6

sale of one of the covered securities." 

7

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Yes, Your Honor. 


8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There has been no purchase 


9
10
11
12

or sale here. 
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, there's been a 


purported purchase. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It can't be in connection 


13

with a purchase or sale that has never occurred.  I 

14

mean, it could be have read in connection with the 

15

purchase or sale or the promised purchase or sale or the 

16

contemplated purchase or sale, but it doesn't.  It says, 

17

"in connection with the purchase or sale." 

18

 I don't know how you can make that stick to 

19

a situation where there has been no purchase or sale. 

20

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

That's true, Your Honor, 

21

but it also doesn't say the consummated purchase or 

22

sale, and so I think the purported, intended, 

23

consummated, all those things are swept up in the text. 

24

And I think that's consistent with the way that you 

25

would use the phrase in ordinary life.

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 If I were going to go to my real estate 

2

brokers to sell my house, I might gather up a bunch of 

3

documents, I might show up at the office at a certain 

4

time, in connection with the sale of my house.  And even 

5

if the sale falls through and there is no consummated 

6

contract, I've still done those things in connection 

7

with the sale. 

8
9

 And as I say, I think courts and the SEC 
have consistently taken that position, and if it 

10

weren't  if that weren't the case, then egregious 

11

frauds would go unremedied, and that would be a 

12

tremendous problem.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. THOMAS GOLDSTEIN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

18

it please the Court: 

19

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 I would ask you to write an opinion 

20

affirming and that adopts the following rule  and that 

21

is that a false promise to purchase securities for one's 

22

self in which no other person will have an interest is 

23

not a material misrepresentation in connection with the 

24

purchase or sale of covered securities. 

25

 The other side has asked you to adopt a rule

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that has never been advocated by the SEC in any other 

2

proceeding; it's never been advocated, as I understand 

3

it, in its briefs in this case; it's never been adopted 

4

by any Court ever.  And I think there are good reasons 

5

for that. 

6

 Their theory is that what happened here is 

7

that there was a promise to buy covered securities that 

8

would be for the benefit of someone else.  That has two 

9

textual flaws, it doesn't comport with the purpose of 

10

the statute, and it would have extraordinary 

11

consequences. 

12

 It doesn't  it doesn't conform to the text 

13

of the statute in either of two ways.  Covered security, 

14

which is what the Plaintiffs here purchased, is a 

15

defined term.  It is a security, but only the subset of 

16

securities that are traded on a national exchange and 

17

some of the other additions that would involve, for 

18

example, mutual funds. 

19

 And so Congress didn't say that it was in 

20

connection with the purchase or sale of a covered 

21

security, if it was a covered security that someone else 

22

would get the benefit of. 

23

 It is  what has to be bought here is a 

24

stock, and instead, what was bought here was a CD.  As 

25

Mr. Clement says, this is a case of a massive fraud.  He

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could well have said, this is a case of a massive 

2

securities fraud, but it was not a case of a covered 

3

securities fraud.  The Plaintiffs here bought something 

4

that Congress specifically excluded from preclusion 

5

under SLUSA. 

6
7
8
9

 The second textual flaw in their position is 
that 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I don't understand what the 


first textual flaw is. 

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  So 


11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What is the jumping off 


12

point for this flaw? 

13

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

14

The jumping off point is 


that there  is the defined term "covered security." 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Right. 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

So SLUSA only applies if 

17

there was a material misrepresentation in the  in the 

18

purchase or sale of a covered security. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, everybody  the case 

20

proceeds on the assumption that the  that the CDs were 

21

not covered securities.  The question is whether it's 

22

the "in connection with" requirement is met by the 

23

allegation, which is interpreted to mean that there 

24

would be future purchases and sales of covered 

25

securities.

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So I'm not sure what  what you're getting 

2

out of the fact that covered securities is a  is a 

3

defined term. 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Because Congress asked 

5

you  or told the courts to focus on the question of 

6

what the product is, that there was a misrepresentation 

7

in the course of the transaction, in the course of the 

8

purchase or sale, and that is only a covered security. 

9

It is not some other product that has, as a benefit, an 

10
11

interest in a covered security. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It doesn't say a 

12

misrepresentation about the covered security.  It says, 

13

"a misrepresentation in connection with." 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That's actually, I think, 

15

Your Honor, a really good point for us because the other 

16

side's argument, up till the brief  excuse me  up 

17

until the oral argument, is that it was a 

18

misrepresentation about covered securities that would 

19

trigger SLUSA. 

20

 The problem with their position is that what 

21

the Court has always said, when it talked about the 

22

definition of "in connection with," is really two 

23

things.  It has to be flexible.  We have to give the SEC 

24

the ability to deal with novel frauds.  But because, 

25

metaphysically, everything is connected with everything

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

else, we're going to have to draw a line.  There's going 

2

to have to be some limit. 

3

 And you've pointed out that it's not an 

4

easily administered one, but the  the bulwark, the one 

5

thing that stops 10b5 from getting completely out of 

6

control, is that all of the frauds involved are ones 

7

that the Court has recognized would have an effect on 

8

the regulated market.  That was true in O'Hagan; it was 

9

true in Zandford. 

10

 Now, I realize that my friend from the 

11

Solicitor General's Office said today, at the podium, 

12

that they can imagine that this fraud would have an 

13

effect on the regulated market.  They did say the 

14

opposite in their briefing in the case.  Their brief at 

15

the cert stage said there was no possibility that there 

16

would be an effect on the regulated market. 

17

 And so this, I  I imagine 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19
20

Can you  can you 

just give me the page for that? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes, sir.  The  it is  I 

21

will get it during the  it's quoted multiple times in 

22

our brief, but my colleagues will get it, if you don't 

23

mind, and 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Oh, no.  It's okay. 

It's in the cert pages, at

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about page 12, I think, but we'll  I will have it for 

2

you in just a moment, please. 

3

 And they said there is no  the  to quote 

4

it almost verbatim, there was no prospect that this 

5

fraud would have an effect on the covered securities 

6

market. 

7

 The second textual flaw 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9
10

Well, wait.  And  and if 

that's  if that's wrong, you acknowledge you don't 
win? 

11

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, I do not. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

difference does it make? 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

All right.  Okay.  So what 

Well, it  it is a  as I 

15

understood, they're  they seem to recognize, and if 

16

you were to read, for example, their brief in Zandford, they say 

17

that the sine qua non of their ability to determine as 

18

the enforcement authority here, that something has a 

19

is in connection with the purchase or sale of the 

20

regulated security is whether it would have an effect on 

21

the regulated market. 

22

 They wrote a brief to you saying that and 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24
25

And you really don't agree 

with that anyway. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I think that that is their

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

best hope, and I don't think they can satisfy it.  We 

2

think their authority is narrower still. 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What  what is your 

4

position if the broker says, give me $100,000, and I 

5

will buy covered securities, and then he just pockets it 

6

and  and flees? 

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That is securities fraud, in 

8

our view, according to the SEC's administrative 

9

position.  No court has ever said that  so that's 

10
11

Justice Scalia's point from the first halfhour. 
 We can  if that is correct, if the SEC is 

12

correct about that, we still prevail because what's 

13

happening is the broker is saying, I will purchase for 

14

you the covered securities.  That's what the Line case 

15

stands for. 

16

 Their brief in 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I don't see how this 

18

case is that much different.  They say, we were going to 

19

invest in CDs, and the CDs will be backed by purchase of 

20

the securities that we will purchase for you. 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.   So the  the 

22

critical difference, I think, is in the definition of 

23

"purchase."  And that was going to be the second textual 

24

flaw that I was going to point out.  And that is we can 

25

acknowledge that they would have a much stronger case in

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the hypothetical that you've described if the covered 

2

securities are pledged to back the CDs. 

3

 This happens, for example, on a margin 

4

account.  It happens if  there are lots of times 

5

someone will say, I intend to use your money to buy 

6

covered securities, to buy stocks, and I am providing 

7

those stocks as security for the loan. 

8
9

 The reason that's securities fraud is the 
definition of a purchase includes pledging the 

10

pledging the stocks.  That's really important.  And it 

11

tracks with the Court's holding that "in connection 

12

with" reaches as far as frauds that would have an effect 

13

on the regulated market. 

14

 Imagine if I were allowed to say, look, I am 

15

going to buy covered securities, and you now hold an 

16

interest in them  an enforceable interest in the 

17

stocks.  And if that were not securities fraud, the 

18

market couldn't function very well because things like 

19

margin accounts, you could never have the confidence 

20

that you would have the protection of 10b5. 

21

 The critical difference, Justice Kennedy, is 

22

between two different cases.  If  this case, which is 

23

SIB, says, look  among all of its many 

24

misrepresentations  I will take your money, and I 

25

intend to buy covered securities.  That gets the  you

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

know, putting all aside the difficulty of liquid assets 

2

versus covered securities, give them their best version 

3

of the representation here. 

4

 But it was only buying it for itself. 

It 

5

did not pledge to sell the assets.  It did not give the 

6

plaintiffs any interest in them.  For example, the 

7

interest rate on the CDs was completely independent of 

8

the return on those covered securities. 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Goldstein, I take it, 

10

from what you said up to now, that you are not defending 

11

the Fifth Circuit's test.  It called for a determination 

12

whether the misrepresentation is the heart or the crux 

13

of the complaint. 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

We  we do defend that 

15

rule.  We do not think it's the best ground to decide 

16

the case, and I will explain what I mean by that. 

17

 The Fifth Circuit undertook to articulate a 

18

rule that would govern all cases in which someone 

19

purchased something that was supposedly invested in 

20

covered securities; so including, for example, the 

21

Madoff cases, where there was securities fraud.  Madoff 

22

falsely sold interest in a fund.  That's core securities 

23

fraud. 

24
25

 SIB never sold any securities at all. 

It 

only sold CDs.  So if the Court believed that the Fifth

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Circuit was correct, that it was appropriate to decide 

2

all of these derivative investments  if I could, 

3

cases  then we think you need a flexible term like 

4

"more than tangentially related." 

5

 But we think this case stands on its own, on 

6

the question of, look, if I promise  if I sell you 

7

something, and I say I am going to take the money and 

8

buy CDs for myself, and those CDs have the quality of 

9

being liquid  now, you don't have an interest in the 

10

CDs, I am not pledging them to you, so there is no 

11

purchase by you of a covered security  then that is 

12

not a securities fraud. 

13

 And I did want  want to get 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, but that's the 

15

Line case where, I am told by the government, you were 

16

trying to  I know that Justice Scalia doesn't think 

17

it's important, but I do.  Okay? 

18

 If someone tells me, sell your securities, 

19

give me the money, I will buy securities for myself and 

20

give you a fixed rate of return later, I think that's in 

21

connection with the purchase and sale of securities, 

22

even though it's not legally purchased for my benefit. 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  Two things about 

24

that, Justice Sotomayor.  I will say that if  what I 

25

think you were actually told from the podium is that it

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is unclear from the SEC's administrative opinion whether 

2

the persons who gave the money to the broker as an 

3

investment were actually given an interest in the 

4

securities. 

5

 It's just not clear from that opinion. 

6

There is certainly no SEC holding.  Second 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

9

Let's assume they were. 
Okay.  Then the second thing 

I would say is the SEC has always been very clear to you 

10

that the key part of your hypothetical is that it's a 

11

broker.  And the SEC has said to you repeatedly, and I 

12

will just give this to you from their Zandford brief at 

13

page 23. 

14

 "There is a particularly strong connection 

15

between fraud and securities transactions when 

16

stockbrokers, like Respondent, misappropriate securities 

17

and securities proceeds from brokerage accounts." 

18

 The key feature is that you can understand 

19

why it is that the market can't function if your 

20

stockbroker is making promises about buying and selling 

21

securities.  This is a bank.  This is a bank that 

22

doesn't issue covered securities in any way because it's 

23

a foreign bank.  It issues only the noncovered 

24

securities that Congress specifically excluded from 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's true, suppose  I

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think what is difficult to define  Jay Fisk gets into 

2

his horse and carriage, drives up and down Wall Street, 

3

and says, "I'm going to buy Union Pacific, I'm going to 

4

buy Union Pacific," knowing that people will, in fact, 

5

all run out and buy it quickly, and what he really 

6

intends to do is, when it comes out, he didn't, he's 

7

going to sell outright. 

8
9
10
11
12

 Anyway, typical fraud. 

Now, that is 

certainly covered. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes.  That's market 

manipulation. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  So  so now, 

13

here, what we have is Mr. Stanford, I guess, saying to 

14

people, "I'm going to buy securities, I'm going to buy 

15

securities."  And maybe he didn't. 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20
21

Yes. 
Just like Jay Fisk. 
Sure. 
Okay.  So why does the 

first fall within and not the second? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Because the first completely 

22

messes up the stock market and the second one has 

23

nothing to do with it.  The first 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You mean, in other words, 

if they had done exactly the same thing, but with an

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

intent or  or maybe and the affect of a purchaser of 

2

stock or a seller of stock reacting to the statement, 

3

then it affects it? 

4
5
6
7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Absolutely, because that's 

the sine qua non 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  Where neither of 

those is present, it doesn't. 

8

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right. 
Okay. 

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

And it's not 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Could  could you go back 

12

to the Madoff case 

13

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  because you portrayed it 

Yes. 

15

as investors joining into funds that directly held 

16

stock, and I thought that it was more complicated than 

17

that. 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  I  I will play it 

19

out.  That was not my intention.  The Madoff cases 

20

involved the following scenario, and there are diverse 

21

ones, and so I caution the course  the Court about 

22

trying to lay down a rule that will govern all those. 

23

 So Madoff engages in securities fraud. 

24

We  in covered securities fraud.  He says, I have this 

25

fund; it is invested in stocks.  That turns out to be

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

completely untrue.  So we know that Madoff engaged in 

2

securities fraud. 

3

 The Madoff cases are about the next 

4

generation, the indirect purchasers, and that is people 

5

who bought into a fund, and the fund bought into Madoff. 

6

Now, those cases have been resolved on two separate 

7

grounds that may not be entirely consistent, neither one 

8

of which has any implications for our case. 

9

 Theory number one, and this is by  in an 

10

opinion by Judge Rakoff, just a few weeks ago for the 

11

Second Circuit.  He says, look, the indirect purchaser 

12

cases are covered by SLUSA because I look at SLUSA, and 

13

it says, look at the allegation. 

14

 And the core allegation in those cases is of 

15

covered securities fraud.  It is that I was deceived, I 

16

lost my money, I should say  because Madoff engaged in 

17

securities fraud.  He was selling air.  He wasn't 

18

selling anything at all.  That's not this case.  SIB 

19

sold only noncovered securities. 

20

 The second way they have been resolved is 

21

that you may be said to have  when you bought into 

22

what are called the "feeder funds," that  that in turn 

23

invested in Madoff, you may well have purchased an 

24

interest in the Madoff fund itself.  And, therefore, you 

25

were engaged effectively in the purchase or sale of

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

covered securities. 
 That is clearly on the other side of the 

3

line from this case.  Nobody contends that we bought 

4

anything other than noncovered assets.  Now, I have 

5

tried to get to the  to the hypotheticals that the 

6

Court put to the  my friends in the first halfhour. 

7

And realize that these 

8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
I'm just 

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12
13
14

I'm sorry. 


Yeah. 

 about 30 seconds 


behind you. 
Nobody contends that you bought anything 

other than noncovered assets? 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Correct. 
I thought there was 

17

an allegation that you were purchasing and selling 

18

covered assets.  The ones that were misrepresented to be 

19

backing CDs. 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, sir.  They have not even 

21

made that argument.  They say that it's enough to 

22

trigger SLUSA, that SIB bought something that was said, 

23

in some sense  and I have no idea what the rule is, to 

24

be for our benefit or to back our CDs, but the only 

25

it is categorically the case that the only purchase or

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sale by the Plaintiffs 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

By SIB. 

Yes, yes, sir.  Now, this 

4

is, of course, a significant step further than the line 

5

that already concerned some members of the Court, 

6

Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas and the late Chief 

7

Justice dissented in O'Hagan, and this is a very 

8

significant move further than even that case because the 

9

emphasis of the SEC in O'Hagan was that that kind of 

10

fraud would have a tremendous effect on the market if 

11

if people didn't  couldn't be confident that the 

12

other  the person on the other side of the trade had 

13

material nonpublic information. 

14

 Now, returning to the hypotheticals that the 

15

Court put to my friends in the first halfhour, realize 

16

they're not hypotheticals.  They are exactly why the SEC 

17

is in the case.  The SEC doesn't administer SLUSA.  It 

18

is concerned that a narrower reading of "in connection 

19

with" will affect its ability to administer the 

20

securities laws. 

21

 But you put to the SEC the question, okay, 

22

name a case that you've brought in the past 80 years 

23

that you could not bring if the Plaintiffs prevail here. 

24

Name a case that you, hypothetically, want to bring. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean, that's exactly

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what I would like you to think about for a second 

2

because the last words of Ms. Goldenberg of the SEC, 

3

well, if you win, it's going to seriously hamper the SEC 

4

in combatting fraud. 

5

 Of course, it wouldn't in a case like this, 

6

because they aren't limited by covered securities, they 

7

can deal with any security, and they did bring a case 

8

here.  But they're worried about what you say, that 

9

somehow this will narrow their authority, and they quote 

10
11

Line, which is debatable. 
 But assuming that it's debatable, Mr. 

12

Mr. Clement will have a chance to answer this exact 

13

question.  And so you are saying there are none.  And 

14

Line is debatable.  And, therefore, it would not have 

15

hampered them in any case in the past, nor any one we're 

16

likely to think of in the future, but for Line, which is 

17

somebody's decision over at the SEC, and can be argued 

18

that it fits within your definition. 

19

 Is that really your answer? 

Or are we going 

20

to discover Mr. Clement coming up and saying, you forgot 

21

about da, da, da, da, da? 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

If he does, it'll be the 

23

first time.  They filed three merits briefs, three reply 

24

briefs, the SEC filed a cert stage amicus brief.  It 

25

filed a merits amicus brief.  It has argued orally in

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

front of you.  And so far, we haven't found a case. 

2

 Now, can you  can I tell you that I can 

3

imagine a case that, because of my rule, the SEC can't 

4

bring?  I can and I think that they shouldn't be allowed 

5

to bring it.  I'm not saying that our rule has no effect 

6

on them.  I'm saying it does. 

7

 But it's the lending cases, it's the 

8

prenuptial cases, it's those things that hang over the 

9

economy like a loaded gun. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Aren't those rather 

11

academic because SLUSA wouldn't be a bar to them anyway, 

12

because then that's class actions? 

13

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

My point  my point, 

14

Justice Ginsburg, I apologize, is not that those are 

15

affected by  that those  that rule affects SLUSA. 

16

It affects the SEC's ability to bring a felony 

17

prosecution, despite the rule of lenity on the basis 

18

that that's securities fraud. 

19

 Really understanding the consequence of this 

20

case, I'll admit to you, that the effect on SLUSA 

21

this is kind of a oneoff case.  They haven't identified 

22

any other cases like this under SLUSA, so they're 

23

adopting a very broad reading of "in connection" to kind 

24

of kill a gnat. 

25

 But the reason that they  the SEC wants to

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do it is because it wants an extremely broad reading of 

2

"in connection with the purchase or sale."  They want to 

3

be able to bring a case in which someone is alleged to 

4

have purchased a nonsecurity, a house, issued a loan, 

5

on the basis of some statement about the liquidity of 

6

the fraudster. 

7

 And that is never a case that's ever been 

8

brought before.  And so it's true that we would prevent 

9

them from doing that, but that's a good thing, not a bad 

10

thing.  They've had 80 years to say that they need that 

11

authority, and they never have. 

12

 If there is going to be a way in which we 

13

lose this case, notwithstanding the foregoing, I think 

14

it's going to be Justice Alito's concern, can you 

15

articulate a narrower rule in favor of the Petitioners 

16

that says it was the feature that they were covered 

17

securities that was essential to the fraud. 

18

 I think we can say, first, that is not in 

19

the text of the statute, right?  That those words don't 

20

appear. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, all that's in the text 

22

of the statute is "in connection with," which is 

23

openended, so I don't know what you're going to get 

24

from the text of the statute. 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, I do think that this

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was not in connection with the purchase or sale.  It 

2

certainly wasn't material to any purchase or sale.  But 

3

the other thing, Justice Alito, is this notion that 

4

that the feature of them being stocks was essential to 

5

the fraud would be true in, for example, a loan. 

6

 If I say to you, I want to get a loan for 

7

$100,000, I promise to buy for myself stocks that I 

8

could sell to repay the loan, the only thing that was 

9

critical about them is that they were liquid.  And 

10

remember, that's actually all that SIB said, is that it 

11

had liquid assets.  That's the only feature of it.  And 

12

so if we're going to focus on that 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you're not contesting 

14

at this point  I think both courts below assumed that 

15

the assets included stocks that would be traded on the 

16

exchange.  You're not making the argument that it's 

17

not necessarily  that maybe the portfolio included 

18

nothing that was traded on the exchange? 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

We are not.  I will say, 

20

however, that the other side has a serious problem of 

21

administrability of an opinion in its favor in the 

22

following way:  Justice Ginsburg, the $7 billion in 

23

assets that SIB claimed to own clearly included some 

24

stocks on the NYSE.  I think that's perfectly fair. 

25

 The question is how many? 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Nobody knows the

Official

1

answer to that.  And if you are going to rule for them, 

2

the lower courts are going to face cases where a bank 

3

says, we have liquid assets as well. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Can I just be clear on 

5

your  your position on the issue of whether there has 

6

to be an actual purchase or sale? 

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What is your answer?  Yes, 

9
10

there must be, or, no, it's not essential? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It is not essential to our 

11

position.  If you agree  if you agree with the SEC 

12

that there doesn't have to be a purchase or a sale, we 

13

still easily win the case.  No court has  I believe 

14

that's only been resolved administratively.  And so you 

15

would have to decide that, in their favor, in order to 

16

win the case.  In order  we are not giving up on the 

17

question. 

18
19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You don't want us to decide 

the case on that basis? 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You don't want us to issue 

22

an opinion that says there has to be a purchase or sale 

23

and, therefore, affirm. 

24
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That is not the ground on 

which we have pressed the case in front of you.  I'm not

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

trying to make it more complicated.  I'm  it is 

2

illustrative of all the rules that they need you to 

3

adopt that no court has ever adopted. 

4

 Remember, on Page 21 of their brief, which 

5

is what you're being pointed to as their best cases, 

6

they point to three administrative proceedings, no court 

7

decision of a district court, court of appeals, or this 

8

Court, and it's only on the failure to purchase point. 

9

 They have no cases in which the  the core 

10

features of this case are present, and that is you have 

11

a fraud that would not have an effect they had 

12

previously said on the regulated market whatsoever.  And 

13

it's merely the fact that it's for the benefit of 

14

someone else. 

15

 There  no court has ever adopted it. 

16

And  and in picking up what this Court said was so 

17

important in Zandford and O'Hagan is that it has not 

18

been the SEC's position in the past.  I know they have 

19

said it when they stood up today, but there, the SEC 

20

assured you, for decades, we have taken this position, 

21

it's been essential to our enforcement priorities, under 

22

Section 10b, this case is completely different. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if we decided the case 

24

on that basis, it really would be a oneoff.  So the 

25

SEC, today, has told us this would have an effect on the

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

securities market. 
 But you  we would hold  we won't listen 

3

to that because, at an earlier point in the case, as 

4

interpreted by you, they said it wouldn't.  So that 

5

would be  that would be the holding where  you know, 

6

because the SEC previously said it wouldn't be an effect 

7

on the securities market, that's the reason for the 

8

decision. 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, sir.  My point is not 

10

that when the SEC says it it becomes true.  We 

11

certainly don't agree with that.  My point is that they 

12

haven't articulated  before, they said the opposite, 

13

and today, they haven't articulated anything that is 

14

more than the kind of metaphysical go from here to here 

15

to here. 

16

 And it asks too much when we start from a 

17

statute that carved these CDs out.  Congress said, we 

18

have this idea of a security, we have this idea from the 

19

National Securities Markets Improvements Act that the 

20

States regulate noncovered securities, and so we are 

21

going to say that the preclusive effect of SLUSA does 

22

not reach these things like the CDs that we leave to 

23

regulation by the State. 

24
25

 So this case clearly falls very easily 
within the  the text of SLUSA as being not precluded.

Then you ask, well, am I going to stretch the language 

2

of the statute to say, well, even though these are 

3

noncovered CDs, because securities were involved, I 

4

think SLUSA should still apply. 

5

 In asking whether you should stretch the 

6

language, you would say, well, what's the point of the 

7

phrase "in connection with"?  Why did Congress give it 

8

that kind of capacious reading, but didn't say fraud 

9

about securities or fraud involving securities? 

10

 It did say "in connection with." 

And what 

11

your precedents have said over and over and over and 

12

what has been the dividing line that has prevented 10b5 

13

from swallowing all fraud is that these are 

14

misrepresentations that affect the regulated market 

15

negatively.  These  this fraud did not do that. 

16

 If there are no further questions.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

20

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

21

 MR. CLEMENT: 

22

 A couple of points. 

Thank you, Your Honor. 
First of all, 

23

this  it is just simply wrong that courts have not 

24

decided that a purported sale is covered.  The Grippo 

25

case from the Eleventh Circuit, which we cite in both

53

Alderson Reporting Company

our opening and reply brief, is one of those cases. 

2

There are others consistent with the SEC's longstanding 

3

position.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Zandford is a case like 

that.  That 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Zandford is a case from this 

Court that, essentially, says that as well. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Would you  among all 

the circuit courts, which test would you adopt? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

I don't know that I would 

11

adopt any of them, Your Honor, because I think a lot of 

12

them make the same mistake, which is they get 

13

materiality, and they sneak it into the "in connection 

14

with" requirements.  So 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

the Sixth Circuit. 

17

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Except Judge Sutton in 

Yes, and I think, if you were 

18

going to accept one test, I would accept  I would ask 

19

you to have the Siegel test from Judge Sutton, but I do 

20

think it's a mistake to have materiality or causation 

21

slip into the "in connection with" requirement. 

22

 I'd like to start with Justice Kennedy's 

23

very apt observation that this fraud here is very 

24

similar to the paradigmatic securities fraud where I 

25

simply  a broker simply says, give me your money, I

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

will buy securities, and never does. 
 And from the perspective of the defrauded 

3

party, it doesn't matter whether what they get in return 

4

is a statement that says they own some securities or a 

5

statement in a feeder fund that says they have an 

6

interest in the Madoff fund or whether they get, here, a 

7

CD that they are told by the  the brochure that tells 

8

them what this is all about, that it's backed by the 

9

investments in the securities.  They're all one and the 

10
11

same. 
 Another thing I have to correct is it's 

12

simply not true that the returns here were not variable 

13

on the performance of the portfolio.  It's not really 

14

well developed in the record here, but if you want to, 

15

we could lodge the brochures that are used to market 

16

these things that tell these guys that their returns are 

17

variable and that they could lose all of their principal 

18

because of the investments in covered securities. 

19

 A second thing is, of course, Mr. Goldstein 

20

correctly says there are particular problems when broker 

21

dealers lie about covered securities.  Well, so, too, 

22

there are particular problems when an unregistered 

23

investment company lies about covered securities.  And 

24

that's what their own complaint says was the reality of 

25

these  of the Stanford Investment Bank, that it was an

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

unregistered investment company. 
 That's interesting for two reasons. 

One, if 

3

it were a registered investment company, all of its 

4

securities would be covered securities.  That's another 

5

way you can get within the covered security band.  So 

6

this idea that Mr. Goldstein proclaims, this is not a 

7

covered securities fraud, is simply wrong.  It is. 

8
9

 It was material to this fraud to make 
misrepresentations about purchases of covered 

10

securities.  Without those representations that we're 

11

going to take their money and we're going to reinvest 

12

it  again, words from their complaint  in covered 

13

securities, nobody's going to give their money to a bank 

14

in Antigua. 

15

 The reason you give your money to a bank in 

16

Antigua is because you think it's backed by something 

17

more than a piece of paper, and the something more was 

18

purchases of covered securities on the market.  So 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Even if you're right 

20

about that, Mr. Clement, they also said there was a 

21

representation that this is insured by Lloyds, and there 

22

was another claim that they made.  So even  even if 

23

you are right, wouldn't the answer be, okay, drop 

24

anything that has to do with "in connection with the 

25

sale or purchase of securities."

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 We have  oh, we have a claim about the 

2

insurance, and we also have a claim that both Antigua 

3

and United States were heavily regulated.  Those were 

4

false. 

5

 Why couldn't they have a complaint shorn of 

6

the incorrect premise and based on the insurance and the 

7

regulated aspects? 

8

 MR. CLEMENT: 

9

If I can answer?  First of 

all, I think that Mr. Goldstein was quite prudent to not 

10

defend the Fifth Circuit's rationale.  So the fact that 

11

there are other misrepresentations should not mean that 

12

a misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or 

13

sale of covered securities is somehow okay.  SLUSA makes 

14

clear that any misrepresentation is enough. 

15

 Now, the other thing I would say, very 

16

briefly, is that they may have an opportunity to try to 

17

replead.  That, in a sense, is the next case.  I assure 

18

you that we would be arguing here, where the essence of 

19

their claim is to hold the Petitioners secondarily 

20

liable for the underlying misrepresentations, they have 

21

to sort of have to take them all, but that's the next 

22

case. 

23

 Thank you, Your Honor.
