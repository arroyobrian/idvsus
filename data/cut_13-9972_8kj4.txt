 (11:22 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

next this morning in Case 139972, Rodriguez v. The 

5

United States. 

6
7
8
9
10
11

 Mr. O'Connor. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHANNON P. O'CONNOR 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The big issue that starts in this case is 

12

whether, after completing the task related to a traffic 

13

stop, whether an officer without individualized 

14

suspicion can hold the driver for a dog sniff.  The 

15

specific question in this case is whether Officer 

16

Struble was entitled to piggyback an already completed 

17

traffic offense with probable cause on to that piggyback 

18

 on to that traffic offense for an investigation of 

19

Mr. Rodriguez involving nothing more than a hunch.  That 

20

is the question of the case. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But that remains  that 

22

wasn't reached by the court of appeals.  The district 

23

the district court, as you pointed out, rejected the 

24

argument that there was probable cause saying if nothing 

25

more than a hunch.  But that was not reviewed by the

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

court of appeals.  So that would still be open. 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

The  the decision of the 

3

court of appeals, Your Honor, absolutely, that was a de 

4

minimis ruling.  They did not reach the question as to 

5

whether there was reasonable suspicion, and left it just 

6

based on their ruling of  of whether, in fact, this 

7

was a de minimis action. 

8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Counsel, do you 

concede that this would be all right if the dog sniff 

10

took place during the traffic stop?  In other words, 

11

let's say, there were, you know, two  two policemen 

12

there already.  One says, I'm going to go write you a 

13

ticket and while that's taking place, the other 

14

policeman walks around with the dog.  No problem with 

15

that? 

16

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

There'd be no problem, 

17

Mr. Chief Justice, if  if, in fact, all of that was 

18

done before the traffic ticket was written.  If, in 

19

fact, the dog was written  taken around the car prior 

20

to the completion of the traffic stop and the ticket, 

21

then, of course, it would be 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All right. 
Mr. O'Connor 

24

Mr. O'Connor, it's frequent that a policeman, when he 

25

stops somebody for a broken taillight or whatever, will

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

conduct some other inquiries, you know, where are you 

2

going?  Ask a lot of questions.  He will  he will 

3

check whether the person is  is driving a stolen car, 

4

whether  whether the person is properly licensed.  All 

5

of that has nothing to do with the broken taillight and 

6

yet, that's permitted, right? 

7

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

11

no, he  he would not 

13

It  at that point in time, 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is that right?  He  he 

can only do that before he writes the ticket. 

14

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

Would it be permitted if he 

did it after he wrote the ticket? 

10

12

Yes.  Yeah. 

If assuming that 
What if he's not giving a 

ticket, he's just going to give him a warning? 

17

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

When 
And he says to the man, you 

19

shouldn't have done and you went a little bit over the 

20

line.  Be careful next time.  By the way, let me  let 

21

me see your driver's license.  That would be bad. 

22

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Yes, Your Honor, that would 

23

 that would.  It would be because that would be part 

24

of the stop. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So 

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

All  all of those questions 

2

would be  once the stop is finished, then he should be 

3

allowed to go no matter what the question was. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is it  is it your argument 

5

that  that as soon as all of the steps that must be 

6

taken in connection with the traffic stop are completed, 

7

then the  the stop must end?  Or is it that nothing 

8

more can be done after the ticket is issued?  In other 

9

words, is it the length of time or is it the formal act 

10

of giving the ticket or the warning that  that cuts 

11

things off? 

12

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Your Honor, it is the formal 

13

act.  Once the act of the traffic stop is done, which 

14

would be the reason, which would be the purpose for the 

15

stop, once that is done, that is the 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes.  But the  the 

17

"that" is done is  is not clear.  Two questions.  In 

18

Justice Scalia's hypothetical, the officer said, I'm not 

19

going to give you a ticket, but I just want to ask you a 

20

few questions.  It seems to me that under your argument, 

21

those questions are impermissible because he's made his 

22

decision, he's not going to give a ticket. 

23

 On the other hand, as Justice Alito 

24

indicated, suppose that he said, now, I finished your 

25

ticket, but before I give it to you, I'm going to go

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

back to the police car and check to see if there are 

2

warrants, is that all right? 

3
4
5

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

If it is the completion of 

the 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

He says, I've finished 

6

writing the ticket, I've folded my notebook, I'm going 

7

to give you this ticket.  But I'm first going to go back 

8

and see if my radio check has come in to verify your 

9

license plates.  Is that permitted? 

10

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

11

traffic stop, it is not. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14
15

If it is the end of the 

But first of all 
But that's what he was 

asking. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 these are 

16

hypotheticals that have a wrong presumption, okay? 

17

There are certain tasks involved in giving a traffic 

18

ticket, correct? 

19

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, Your Honor.  Yes. 
And those include 

21

checking for warrants, checking for tickets on the car, 

22

checking identity, asking questions about that, and 

23

generally with identity it also has to do with where are 

24

you going and where are you coming from.  Correct? 

25

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Yes, Your Honor.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And conducting a dog sniff. 

That also, right? 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

6

 My question for you  and it can't be the 

I'm sorry? 
Justice Sotomayor. 
I didn't hear that. 

7

formal act of writing the ticket.  It has to be the 

8

formal  it has to be the acts related to the mission. 

9

When you finish those, that's when the stop ends. 

10
11
12

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Yes, Your Honor, that is 

exactly right. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, but you've tied it 

13

to just writing it  handing over the ticket, but  or 

14

you're not even doing that, you're  you're saying just 

15

writing the ticket, which is crazy. 

16

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

If, in fact, that's  that's 

17

the impression that I gave, that  that is wrong.  It's 

18

not  the formal handing of the ticket is when the stop 

19

is complete.  Once the justification for the stop and 

20

the purpose is complete, the ticket is done, whether it 

21

is a warning, whether it is handed to them, at some 

22

point in time the ticket is done and that's the 

23

investigation of the stop. 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Justice Sotomayor's 

question assumes, and you apparently embrace the

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

assumption, that checking on whether you have a 

2

private  a proper license, checking whether the car is 

3

stolen, all of these things are embraced within the 

4

mission when the only basis for the stop is you have a 

5

broken taillight.  How does that have anything to do 

6

with the broken taillight? 

7
8
9

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Those are things, Your Honor, 

that have been accepted as part of 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I see. 
 the process. 
Well, then maybe dog 

12

sniffing should be too, right?  Dog sniffing is 

13

accepted, so long as it's done before what?  Before 

14

completion of 

15
16
17

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Before the completion of the 

mission. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Which includes not just a 

18

broken taillight, but also inquiring into your license, 

19

inquiring into prior arrests?  That's all part of the 

20

mission? 

21

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, Your Honor, it is. 
Why don't you make the dog 

23

sniff part of the mission and that will solve the 

24

problem? 

25

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Well 

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Part of the mission where 

2

you stop somebody is not just the broken taillight, but, 

3

you know, whether the car is stolen, whether you have 

4

drugs on the car, so let's bring in a dog and do the car 

5

sniff.  I mean, you're willing to expand the mission to 

6

everything up to but not beyond the dog sniff.  Why do 

7

you do that? 

8
9
10
11

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

You expand the mission, Your 

Honor, for everything that comes within the tasks that 
are part of the traffic stop.  The dog sniff 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's a broken taillight. 

12

That's the only thing that comes within the traffic 

13

stop.  All the rest is added on.  And you let them add 

14

it on.  Why do you let them add on the dog sniff?  You 

15

do so long as it occurs before the ticket is delivered; 

16

is that right? 

17

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

You do if it's done before 

18

the  the traffic stop is done.  Ticket would not be a 

19

formal part of 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But you see the problem is 

21

how do you define the traffic stop, and you've already 

22

indicated the traffic stop can include some of the 

23

questioning.  You're really, I think, much better off if 

24

you stick with the formal rule.  Once you hand the 

25

ticket, that's the end of it.  Then you have a formal

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rule.  You're not arguing that, and that leaves us open 

2

to the question of why can't we include the dog sniff. 

3

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, the dog sniff 
It's a policy question. 

5

So answer  answer it as a policy question.  Don't tie 

6

it to the stop or not.  Tie it to something else. 

7

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

As a policy question, if you 

8

could end it with the handing of the ticket, that would 

9

be acceptable.  If we tie  if we tie the traffic 

10

ticket as the end of the  end of the justification for 

11

the stop, then we 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If we hold that it's okay to 

13

have a dog sniff so long as it's before the ticket is 

14

issued, then every police officer other than those who 

15

are uninformed or incompetent will delay the handing 

16

over of the ticket until the dog sniff is completed.  So 

17

what has that  what does that accomplish? 

18

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

20
21

Well 
I mean, it's great for your 

client, but what does it do for the law? 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Your Honor, I think what it 

22

does first, if you have officers that  that wait, if 

23

that's the  if that's the question, Your Honor, if 

24

they wait for the pocket, put the ticket in the pocket 

25

for the dog 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: Yeah if 

If we adopt a 

2

formal rule, that's one of  one of the options, a 

3

formal rule, once you hand over the ticket, that's it, 

4

you can't do anything more.  The person has to be allowed 

5

to go.  All right?  Is that your argument or not? 

6

 MR. KELLER: 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

8

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

10
11

Yes.  Yes, it is. 
That is your argument. 
Yes. 
Then what does  that 

accomplish? 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

What it accomplishes is 

12

the  is the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment.  Once 

13

the stop is done, once the purpose is done, the 

14

justification is done, the person should be free to go. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the question is, is 

16

this  is this very  the easiest thing to get around 

17

by simply saying, would the sequence in which I will do 

18

this, I won't think of issuing the ticket until I've had 

19

the dog sniff?  So that's the problem.  And what are you 

20

accomplishing?  Say, we make  we make the handing over 

21

the ticket the end of the legitimate stop. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 Yeah. 
Well, then the police can 

24

just say, I'm going to defer that a few minutes until 

25

the dog sniff occurs.  It just seems that you're not

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to accomplish any protection for individuals if 

2

that's your position, that  that it was just a 

3

question of when you do it.  So if you do it during the 

4

stop, before the ticket issued, it's okay and if you do 

5

it two minutes after, it's not okay. 

6

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Your Honor, it is  it is 

7

okay when the traffic stop is done.  When the mission is 

8

complete 

9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You can't possibly mean 

that.  You can't possibly mean that. 

11

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, yes, sir, I do. 
The stopping officer says, 

13

I'm done, I got my ticket here.  It's all written out. 

14

However, before I give it to you, I want to have a dog 

15

sniff, I'm going to call in to headquarters.  They're 

16

going to send out a dog.  It's going to take maybe 45 

17

minutes.  You just sit there because the traffic stop is 

18

not  is not terminated until I give you your ticket. 

19

You're going to allow that? 

20

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Well, again, if I  if 

21

the formal  the formal handing of the ticket is not 

22

the end, in your example, Your Honor? 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

In my example, he hasn't 

24

turned over the ticket yet.  He says, I'm  I'm not 

25

going to give you the ticket until the dog comes and

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that's going to take 45 minutes, and that's okay. 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

No, the traffic stop is done. 

3

Whether he hands the ticket to him at that point in 

4

time, if the only reason 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6
7
8
9
10

He has not handed the 

ticket over.  He's  he's kept the ticket. 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

And the reason that he has 

kept the ticket is for the dog to come. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Yeah. 
And  but that is past 

11

the  that is past the traffic stop.  The traffic 

12

stop done 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you're not  you're not 

14

applying a formal test.  I thought you were saying it's 

15

a formal test when you deliver the ticket is the 

16

termination point, but it  that's not right. 

17

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23
24
25

No, that's  no. 
All right. 
The formal test 
So what is the test? 
The formal test 
How long a normal traffic 

stop would take? 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

The formal test  no, your 

Honor, that would not be the case at all.  The formal

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

test is when the mission has been accomplished.  If you 

2

pull someone over for the traffic offense, and if, in 

3

fact, you do all of the tasks that are necessary to 

4

complete it, when it is completed, it is done. 

5

             

6

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What if the officer 

says  says, I need to think about this for a while? 

10

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, whose 
The officer says, I 

12

need to think about this for a while.  I'm going to go 

13

back and I'm going to ponder how long it took you.  I'm 

14

going to think about other tickets I've given in the 

15

past, and, you know, the dogs are going to be here in 

16

8 minutes.  I think I need about 10 minutes to think 

17

about it. 

18

 Is that  is that okay, since he has not 

19

he hasn't written a ticket?  He waits, you know, until 

20

he's thought about it for a while to write the ticket. 

21

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

No, your Honor, that's 

22

that's not okay at all.  If  what has to happen is the 

23

officer must be diligent.  He must be diligent going 

24

towards the investigation of the traffic stop. 

25

 And, again, I think we're putting  and if

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I'm the one that started the miss  misleading of this, 

2

I apologize.  Handing of the ticket is not the endall. 

3

Handing of the ticket is when the tasks are done.  I got 

4

pulled over for a driving offense, then it  it  then 

5

it is over. 

6

 In your example, Mr. Chief Justice, if he's 

7

pondering, then he's not being diligent.  If he's 

8

pondering, you're not being diligent, then that's 

9

when 

10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Gee, we ponder all the 

time, and we think we're being diligent. 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Pondering is not diligent. 
Unless the pondering is to 

15

avoid the diligence, and that would be the question. 

16

The question, then, is if  if, in fact, the officer is 

17

pocketing the ticket, he said, I'm going to wait until 

18

the dog comes, you are then extending the time of the 

19

stop; and it violates the rule that you have in the 

20

laws. 

21

23

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You know, it really 

looks 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You may have 

answered this already, but I'm not sure. 
 Can he ask for the registration? 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Usually,

Official

people have told me, when you're stopped, the officer 

2

says, License and registration. 

3

 (Laughter.) 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

5

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

6

I've had  I've had friends 

that say  say the same thing, Mr. Chief Justice. 

7

 Of course that's okay. 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9
10

Is that okay? 

What about the 

registration is pertinent to the traffic stop? 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Well, what's pertinent about 

11

it is, part of the traffic stop is the vehicle itself as 

12

well.  Not only do you have the driver, but you're 

13

looking at the driver, the driver's history, the car. 

14

All of those things are part and parcel to the 

15
16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If you saw  if you 

saw 

17

 MR. O'CONNOR:  task towards the offense. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If you saw the car 

19

swerve, what does that have to do with the car?  The car 

20

was just doing what the driver did.  And I don't see why 

21

you need the registration of the car. 

22

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

What you can do  no, Your 

23

Honor, I think  Mr. Chief Justice, I think you do.  I 

24

think that is part of investigating the  the 

25

traffic offense.  Those are things that have been

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

accepted  and "accepted" might  might  might not 

2

be the right word  adopted as things that you can do 

3

in a traffic stop. 

4

 Now, there are certainly times when you go 

5

beyond the traffic stop.  And you have the Johnson case. 

6

If, in fact, you go beyond the  the  the traffic 

7

stop even measurably beyond it, then you have violated 

8

the  the  the driver's rights, and it is 

9

unconstitutional.  The question in that case occurred 

10
11

during the traffic stop. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. O'Connor, is this 

12

particular traffic violation, was that an arrestable 

13

offense? 

14

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

15

Your Honor, it was not. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

17

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

No.  Under Nebraska law, no, 

It was not. 
It's a traffic infraction. 
Because if it was an 

19

arrestable offense, they could arrest the driver and 

20

then impound the car and do an inventory search. 

21
22
23

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

If it was an arrestable 

offense, yes, Your Honor, I think that's correct. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

24

arrestable offense. 

25

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

But you say it's not an 

It is not.  And regardless, I

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mean, he was  see, here's the  here's the  what we 

2

do know about this case:  Not only do we know the 

3

mission is done because of the tasks that were 

4

completed, you have the officer that says, I've done the 

5

tasks, everything that needs to be done with this 

6

offense or with this  with this traffic stop is 

7

finished.  It's finished.  There's no question about 

8

that. 

9

 Then there's no more justification. 

In 

10

order for the driver to be continued to be detained, 

11

there must be new justification or consent, which you 

12

did not get in this case; but you must let the driver go 

13

because you are  at the end, you are finished with the 

14

traffic stop, you are finished with the reason that he 

15

was detained in the first place, the purpose:  Going 

16

across the fog line. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can I just ask you a 

18

simple question?  Yes, we've permitted a dog search; but 

19

in the cases that we have, Caballes and others, it was 

20

done simultaneous with the traffic stop.  Correct? 

21

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Correct. 
You said in your brief: 

23

A dog sniff is not a police entitlement to which the 

24

Fourth Amendment limits must bend. 

25

 Is there a line that we should draw at how

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

long citizens should be kept by the side of the road? 

2

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think that the 
All right.  So announce 

4

what that line is.  That's what I think everybody's been 

5

asking you. 

6

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

The line is when  I can 

7

I can start off with  with, perhaps, the Johnson case 

8

again.  When the stop is basically  when the stop is 

9

done 

10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why don't you just do a 

simple test? 

12

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I can give you 
If you're going to do a 

14

 if you're going to do a stop, you can't reasonably 

15

extend or pass the time it takes to deal with a ticket, 

16

correct? 

17

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19
20

I think that 
That would be the simple 

rule. 
 MR. O'CONNOR: 

I think that the simple rule, 

21

if I  if I may propose one, is the same one that 

22

Professor LaFave has  has proposed about a traffic 

23

stop or a simple stop. 

24
25

 Basically what you do is the officer sees 
the infraction; the officer pulls the person over; the

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

officer tells the person what the infraction is; he does 

2

the license; he does the registration, runs the car. 

3

Then when it's done, he gives him the ticket, the 

4

warning ticket. 

5

 That is the end of the traffic stop. 

6

There's no other reason to hold the person after that 

7

point in time. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You say he "runs the car." 

He puts the license plate into the radio and waits for 

10

the report from the station as to whether or not the 

11

license is okay? 

12

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

14
15

Yes, Your Honor. 
Why is that part of the 

mission and the dog sniff is not?  That's the question. 
 If you're not going to have a formal rule, 

16

you have to explain why  somebody's pulled over for a 

17

broken taillight, why the  adding any time to the stop 

18

in order to do a records check is part of the mission 

19

but the dog sniff is not. 

20

 I mean, I could understand the rule, you 

21

pull somebody over for a broken taillight, maybe you get 

22

the registration to make sure you write out the ticket 

23

to the right person.  Then you give him the ticket, and 

24

that's it. 

25

 No  no time for the records check. 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official

1

does the records check have to do with pulling somebody 

2

over for a broken taillight?  I can understand that, but 

3

is that your argument? 

4

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Well, if that is  that is 

5

part of what the courts have accepted as part of the 

6

stop.  You are looking at the vehicle itself. 

7

 Now, the dog, Your Honor, is different. 

The 

8

dog is different because the dog is not a task 

9

related  what the courts have accepted as related to a 

10

traffic stop.  It is a collateral offense  or a 

11

collateral event where you have the dog sniff and do 

12

nothing more than look for drugs, any nothing more than 

13

that. 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I mean, your answer is  I 

15

don't want to interrupt.  Your answer is that the courts 

16

have accepted that you can go  you can prolong this a 

17

little bit to do a records check.  But then you have to 

18

explain why the dog sniff is different. 

19

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

You're not prolonging it, 

20

Your Honor, to do a records check.  That is part of the 

21

stop.  As long as the person, the officer, is diligently 

22

working towards the mission 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why  why is it part? 

24

As the question he has suggested, it's unrelated to the 

25

traffic stop.  You're looking to see if this person has

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a record, committed other crimes, for example.  What has 

2

that got to do with whatever the traffic 

3

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

No. 
 infraction is?  Not 

5

stopping at a stop sign, what has checking to see if the 

6

defendant has a criminal record got to do with that? 

7

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

That is something that the 

8

that the courts are looking at as to whether that is 

9

something that you should be able to do.  The courts 

10
11

have generally accepted that. 
 What I can come back, and 

this particular 

12

case is not something that happened in this case, 

13

because it is clearcut.  Now, that issue is extremely 

14

important, but is something that I don't think can be 

15

done today. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

He can  I mean, 

17

one reason I think they do the records check, the 

18

officer needs to know who he's dealing with.  I think 

19

one of the higher incidences of when officers are shot 

20

or wounded is when they make a traffic stop. 

21

 And So if you run the registration, you see 

22

it's a stolen car, you need to know that before you go 

23

back and deal with the driver and other occupants. 

24

 What if the police officer determines that 

25

he's  he's concerned about that, either as a general

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

matter or as a specific matter.  He takes the license 

2

and registration, but he's not going to go back to the 

3

car until he has backup.  Okay? 

4

 So he calls ahead and said, I would  you 

5

know, I would like backup.  And the person says, you 

6

know, it's going to take 25 minutes, and he says, fine. 

7

 Is that a legitimate reason? 

The traffic 

8

stop isn't over, because he's  he doesn't want to go 

9

back because he's alone and he doesn't know who these 

10

guys are. 

11

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That is a legitimate reason. 
So he can call back. 

13

Now  now, okay, what if the backup is a canine unit? 

14

The canine unit gets there, you've told us it hasn't 

15

been prolonged, and as the officer goes up to give him 

16

the warning the dog walks around the car.  Is that all 

17

right? 

18

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

I think that that is all 

19

right.  And the reason that it's all right is because 

20

you have the diligence of the officer.  Officer safety 

21

is certainly a reason to ask for backup.  Once the 

22

backup is there, the officer then completes the traffic 

23

offense, everything is done, and before that, the dog 

24

has run around, I don't think that there is a problem 

25

with that, because the delay was for a legitimate

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reason, not putting the ticket in  in your pocket. 

2

 If there are no further questions, I will 

3
4
5

request the remaining for rebuttal.

Thank you.  Thank 

you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS 

8

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 

9

 MS. ANDERS: 

10

please the Court: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

11

 In order to avoid the arbitrary results that 

12

Petitioner's brightline rule would  would impose on 

13

traffic stops, a dog sniff conducted during a traffic 

14

stop should be subject to a reasonableness analysis. 

15

Whether the 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How long is reasonable? 

17

You keep saying in your  in your papers you have to 

18

look at the totality of the circumstances, but I don't 

19

know what that means.  I think that keeping me most of 

20

the time, and Chief, I've been stopped  keeping me 

21

past 

22

 MS. ANDERS: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So have I. 
Keeping me past giving 

24

me the ticket is annoying as heck whether it's 5 

25

minutes, 10 minutes, 45.  But how do you define de

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

minimis?  What are the circumstances that would make any 

2

difference be  in holding somebody 5 minutes or 45? 

3

It all has to do with your needs, not the passenger's 

4

needs. 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, if I could explain what 

6

the reasonableness approach is.  First of all, it's 

7

not  it's not a strict de minimis approach that 

8

focuses just on the amount of time in isolation.  It's 

9

a  it's a question about the objective reasonableness 

10
11

of the length of the stop.  And we think that 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

To accomplish what? 

12

Break into  go into their home and search their home? 

13

Is that okay? 

14

 MS. ANDERS: 

The reasonable length of a stop 

15

is the amount of time that it  a stop is reasonable, 

16

even if it includes a dog sniff, if its duration is 

17

within the amount of time  the range of reasonably 

18

reasonable, routine traffic stops that don't involve dog 

19

sniffs.  So we're talking about a length of time that is 

20

still tethered to the traffic violation purpose of the 

21

stop. 

22

 So in addition to not exceeding the sort of 

23

heartland of  of routine traffic stop durations, the 

24

officer also has to be reasonably diligent which means 

25

that he needs to be focused overall.

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What's the heartland of 

2

routine traffic stops?  You have a minute criteria? 

3

What is it, half an hour? 

4

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think within the universe of 

5

routine traffic stops, there's a range.  I mean, the 

6

courts have applied a reasonableness analysis to routine 

7

traffic stops for 30 years.  There is 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What is it?  What is it?  I 

want to know what it is so I can complain when it's 
longer. 

11

 (Laughter.) 

12

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, it depends on the 

13

circumstances that are presented during the stop.  So 

14

for instance, a stop might reasonably take longer if 

15

there are more people in the car so that the officer has 

16

to check the  the criminal histories of more people in 

17

the car.  He has to be more worried about officer 

18

safety.  It 

19
20
21
22
23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How many minutes when there 

are three people in the car? 
 MS. ANDERS: 

The courts  courts 

asserted 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, you've got to pick 

24

a minute.  Don't you have to pick a minute sooner or 

25

later to decide these cases?

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. ANDERS: 

No, I think in  in every 

2

in every case the Court  the Court has to look to the 

3

totality of the circumstances presented. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

And pick a minute. 
And so it's not possible to 

6

pick a minute in the abstract because even  as this 

7

Court said in 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What more do you need? 

There are three people in the car and he's stopped for a 

10

broken taillight. 

11

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, as we said in our brief, 

12

when that situation occurs, courts have upheld stops of 

13

up to, you know, 35 minutes, something like that. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The problem  I have a 

15

great idea.  Why don't we say, taking your test, that 

16

the stop, you can  you can do it, you know, whatever 

17

is normal there, but it cannot be prolonged more than 

18

the time reasonably required to complete the mission, 

19

which happens to be giving a temporary  a traffic 

20

ticket.  Or we could say it cannot last longer than is 

21

necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. 

22

 What an original idea I had. 

It happens to 

23

be language from two cases that we've already said.  And 

24

are you saying anything different?  I don't think so. 

25

If so, what?  And if not  since this is a case where

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

apparently the lower courts have said it did last longer 

2

than was reasonably necessary because the policeman 

3

said, that's why I  I mean, in effect said, according 

4

to the judge  Hey, I called the dog after the stop was 

5

over, or something like that  we cite those two cases, 

6

say those are the tests.  Affirm  or reverse, I guess; 

7

QED.  Goodbye, we say, to all the litigants, and hope 

8

 you are happy. 

9

 Now, when  when  when I hear you say 

10

that it sound  what you've said sounds  sounds 

11

that's what you think we should do. 

12

 MS. ANDERS: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14
15

We think 
But I suspect you don't, 

but I want to know why. 
 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, we think the amount of 

16

time reasonably required to complete the traffic stop 

17

is  is the duration it takes, looking toward 

18

looking to other similar stops, it's the duration 

19

that 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It is the time necessary to 

21

effectuate the purpose of the stop or it is the time 

22

that is reasonably required to complete the mission.  We 

23

can't do better than that.  How can we?  We are not 

24

traffic policemen, and our experience on stops comes 

25

from, unfortunately, being the stoppee rather than the

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

stopper. 
 MS. ANDERS: 

Right.  And a stop can fall 

within that reasonably required time frame 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

6
7

Yeah. 
 even if it includes some 

delay that is attributable to 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course, if it's in the 

8

middle of it, you call the dog and so forth, but you 

9

can't prolong it beyond the time reasonably necessary. 

10

Now, I've said that several times.  I think you may 

11

agree with that. 

12

 MS. ANDERS: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, it 
And then if you do agree 

14

with it, here, it was prolonged more than reasonably 

15

necessary  at least that's what they found  end of 

16

case.  Now 

17

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think looking  looking to 

18

whether the dog sniff occurs before or after the traffic 

19

ticket is given will accord dispositive significance to 

20

the officer's sequencing decision when he gives the 

21

ticket.  As I understand Petitioner's position, it is 

22

that if, in the midst of a traffic stop that, say, lasts 

23

10 minutes, the officer spends 1 minute on a dog sniff, 

24

that is okay even though it has incrementally 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yeah, that's right 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. ANDERS: 

 increased the length of the 

2

stop.  But then you have that very same stop where the 

3

officer gives the ticket first and then adds a minute 

4

for a dog sniff 

5
6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

There are a lot of 

problems 

7

 MS. ANDERS: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 11minute stops and 
There are a lot of problems 

9

with any rule based on reasonableness, and, of course, 

10

there will be difficult problems.  But here we've said 

11

twice that once the stop is over, i.e., goes beyond the 

12

time reasonably necessary to complete the mission, you 

13

cannot call in the dogs; and before, you can. 

14

 Now, of course there will be anomalies in 

15

that respect.  Of course there can be badfaith 

16

exercises.  Of course there can be confusion as to which 

17

is which.  But that's inevitable in the situation and we 

18

can't do anything about it. 

19
20

 Now, what can you suggest that would just 
help us and show we could do something about it? 

21

 MS. ANDERS: 

22

serious anomaly when 

Well, I think it's a pretty 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 MS. ANDERS: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, it may be 
 when 
 but I'm asking you

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what  what is it that we could say better than the 

2

language of the two cases?  I mean, I'm not  I'm not 

3

denying there is a problem with what you just said; 

4

there is.  You might do it  decide to do this 

5

beforehand and do all kinds of excuses.  You know, 

6

people every day of the week make up reasons, they go 

7

about  but if you want a better rule than the one laid 

8

down in the two cases, what? 

9

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, I think there are two 

10

ways to understand the language in the two cases you're 

11

referring to in Caballas.  One is, as I think you're 

12

suggesting, that the time reasonably required to 

13

complete the traffic violation means that time and 

14

nothing else, so that any delay attributable to a dog 

15

sniff as opposed to other 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, I don't think you have 

17

to do that.  I mean, you know, you get into arguments 

18

about it; was it reasonably necessary or not?  It's the 

19

cannot be prolonged beyond the time what is reasonably 

20

necessary.  It is difficult sometimes 

21

 MS. ANDERS: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

reasonably necessary. 

24

 MS. ANDERS: 

25

Well, the one 
 to decide what is 

One  once we accept that 

that a stop can be incrementally prolonged for purposes

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of a dog sniff if that dog sniff occurs during the stop, 

2

so that the officer is doing nothing but that dog sniff, 

3

he's adding a 1minute to a 10minute dog sniff, then 

4

the question would be whether that 11minute total stop 

5

is reasonable.  Then that's the exact same intrusion 

6

that would occur if the officer decided to do all of the 

7

trafficrelated tasks first, that took 10 minutes, and 

8

then he did a dog sniff immediately afterwards.  That's 

9

an 11minute traffic stop. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

11

 MS. ANDERS: 

12
13

Can I just 
It's exactly the same intrusion 

and it should be subject to a reasonableness analysis. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Could I just get a little 

14

clarification on your argument?  If I understand what 

15

you've been saying, you are accepting the idea, aren't 

16

you, that the dog sniff is something that's extraneous 

17

to the mission of the stop; is that correct? 

18

 MS. ANDERS: 

We're not suggesting that it 

19

is  it is an ordinary incident of the traffic stop 

20

that you'd have to take time to stop 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's not an ordinary 

incident. 
 MS. ANDERS: 

But since the Court said in 

24

Caballas that a dog sniff is permissible to perform at 

25

stops sometimes, we think that the analysis as to when

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 it is permissible 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Wait, I'm not getting there 

3

 yet.  I just want to understand  because  some of the 

4

 questions are focused on, like, what is a stop? What's

5

 the mission of the stop?  What's entailed in a normal

6

 stop?  And you're not contesting that a dog sniff is not

7

 something that's entailed in a normal stop even though 

8

 there might be occasions where you can do a dog sniff 

9

 attendant to a stop.

11

 other members of the Court have suggested, once there's

What about

Suppose you have a police 

15

17

 they make it just  just as common to, you know, to 

18

 check on the  the license plate, call in to see if a 

19

 person has any  any prior convictions.  So, also, they 

20

 always take the dog around the car.

Well, I think  I think  I 

 think it 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That  that's what a 

 routine traffic stop is for that jurisdiction. 
 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, I think our point is that 

16

 once there's probable cause to perform a set of 

17

 legitimate investigative inquiries, then if the officer 

18

 can do other investigations during that time such as a 

19

 dog sniff or unrelated questionings, then it ought to be 

20

 constitutionally reasonable to do that.  And that's what 

21

 actually the Courts of Appeals for the most part have 

22

 held with respect 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  But that's where 

24

 I thought that position that I've tried to  let me 

25

 state it more clearly, I think.  It is unlawful to have

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 the dog sniff where the dog sniff unreasonably prolongs 

2

 the stop, is that  does  is that okay if I write 

3

 with the government  if I write those words in an 

4

 opinion? 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

That's right.  But we don't 

6

 think that a dog sniff performed right after the ticket 

7

 per se unreasonably prolongs the stop.  And if I could 

8

 give you a hypothetical that 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Ah.  Well, how  if the 

10

 ticketwriting is over and there is nothing else to do 

11

 and the policeman says, hey, this is over, at that point 

12

 has it not unreasonably prolonged the stop if the sniff 

13

 takes place afterwards? 

14
15

 MS. ANDERS: 

I don't think so.  I mean, just 

 imagine 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Because? 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Because that takes only two 

18
19

 minutes and that's not unreasonable, right? 
 MS. ANDERS: 

That's right.  And it doesn't 

 take into account how he stops 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Big deal.  The dog walks 

 around the car for two minutes.  That's 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It's only a 

24

 violation of the Fourth Amendment for two minutes, 

25

 right?

36

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I mean, the reason I 

3

 don't understand  I don't understand when you're 

4

 talking about prolonging the stop, are you talking about 

5

 here's the amount of time that you are  needed for the 

6

 traffic stop and you're allowed to prolong it sometime 

7

 after that?  Or is it that the  the sniff is part of 

8

 the time for the stop so you're not prolonging it at 

9

 all?  You're including it, you're wrapping it up in the 

10
11

 stop. 
 MS. ANDERS: 

No, I think  I think we  we 

12

 admit that the  that the dog sniff can prolong the 

13

 traffic stop, that it is not a routine part of every 

14

 single traffic stop.  We're not trying to make that 

15

 argument.  But I do think that just because a dog sniff 

16

 prolongs the traffic stop by some, you know, incremental 

17

 amount of time doesn't mean that the stop is per se 

18

 unreasonable. 

19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
 bit.

 MS. ANDERS:

It can prolong it a little 

It can prolong it a reasonable 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And what else  what 

24

 else besides  we have the extraneous dog sniff.  It 

25

 doesn't relate to the traffic violation.  What else?

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Could  could the police say, I've taken the time I've 

2

 needed to look into this traffic violation, but we're in 

3

 a high crime neighborhood, so I'd like to keep this 

4

 driver a bit longer so I can just interrogate him about 

5

 what other things he might have been doing.  And it's 

6

 not going to take  it's only going to take eight 

7

 minutes.  But traffic stop, you've taken care of that. 

8

 And now instead of having the dog come, the police 

9

 officer says, I have a few questions I want to ask you. 

10

 MS. ANDERS: 

Yes.  The Court held  the 

11

 Court held in Arizona v. Johnson that that questioning 

12

 about an unrelated matter is not  like a dog sniff 

13

 it is not an independent Fourth Amendment intrusion. 

14

 So, again, I think the only interest at stake from the 

15

 individual's point of view is the interest against 

16

 unreasonable delay.  And since that is the case, I think 

17

 that the officer can incrementally extend the stop so 

18

 long as the ultimate duration of the stop is 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So you say that 
  Now, what 

21

 about this?  See, I see your problem is, you said, well, 

22

 it can't prolong the stop, the traffic stop more than 

23

 reasonably  you know, it has to be  take the time 

24

 reasonably required to complete the mission.  That's 

25

 what it says, complete the mission.  So we have the

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 intermission prolongation, which has to be reasonable, 

2

 and we have complete the mission.  So complete the 

3

 mission.  Once the mission's completed, it's over. 

4

 That's language from the opinion, too.  Complete, 

5

 complete.  Goodbye.  Over.  At that point it becomes a 

6

 violation of the Fourth Amendment. 

7

 MS. ANDERS: 

And that would lead to 

8

 arbitrary results.  And if I could just give you one 

9

 scenario where that could occur and then tell you why 

10

 practically officers often end up or need to do the dog 

11

 sniff after the tickets. 

12

 So the hypothetical that I propose is that 

13

 if you imagine you have two officers conducting a stop 

14

 and the first officer is explaining the ticket and 

15

 what's happening with the ticket to the person, to the 

16

 driver.  While he's doing that, the second officer is 

17

 performing the dog sniff around the car.  If the officer 

18

 who's explaining the ticket ends first and the dog sniff 

19

 takes another 30 seconds, I don't think there's any 

20

 reason to say that that stop, which maybe lasted a total 

21

 of ten minutes has  has gone on for longer than 

22

 reasonably required to complete the traffic ticket. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I have a  I have 

24

 a real fundamental question, because this line drawing 

25

 is only here because we've now created a Fourth

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Amendment entitlement to search for drugs by using dogs, 

2

 whenever anybody's stopped.  Because that's what you're 

3

 proposing.  And is that really what the Fourth Amendment 

4

 should permit? 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

I don't think it's an 

6

 entitlement, Justice Sotomayor.  I think once the Court 

7

 said in Caballes that  that it is permissible in some 

8

 circumstances to perform a dog sniff during a traffic 

9

 stop, then 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, in some 

11

 circumstances.  So why don't  why don't we keep it 

12

 cabin to Caballes, which is when it's being done 

13

 simultaneous with writing the ticket.  If it's not, then 

14

 it's unlawful. 

15

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, because that leads to 

16

 arbitrary results as I was explaining with 

17

 Justice Breyer, I think in that hypothetical 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It's not arbitrary.  The 

19

 Fourth Amendment is arbitrary by its nature.  It says 

20

 you can't search unless you have probable cause to 

21

 search. 

22

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, Petitioner's rule would 

23

 say that the hypothetical I proposed is impermissible in 

24

 every circumstance; that even a 30second extension of a 

25

 short traffic stop is always unreasonable even if that

40

Alderson Reporting Company

 stop falls within the amount of time it usually takes to 

2

 do routine traffic stops

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Anders  I'm sorry. 

 Please. 
 MS. ANDERS: 

 and the officer is 

 reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic mission. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You know, I  I think I 

8

 read Caballes differently than you.  Here's what I think 

9

 Caballas agrees with you on and here's what I think 

10

 Caballes doesn't.  Caballes definitely agrees with you on 

11

 that a dog sniff is not part of the traffic stop.  So I 

12

 think that you and Caballes are definitely in the same 

13

 place there.  And Caballes definitely says that even 

14

 though a dog sniff is not part of the mission of the 

15

 traffic stop, we're going to allow a dog sniff if the dog 

16

 sniff doesn't extend the traffic stop.  It's like, you 

17

 know, there are two officers or there's some other reason 

18

 why you're not being detained a moment longer because of 

19

 the dog sniff and Caballes basically says, sure, no harm, 

20

 no foul on that one, right? 

21

 But then you're saying Caballes gives you 

22

 this extra leeway to detain people even though it is 

23

 longer than an ordinary traffic stop would take, and I 

24

 think that's just not right.  I mean, I think that 

25

 reasonableness language in Caballes is all about  it's

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 an extra limitation the Court says.  It says, like, 

2

 don't think just because this officer was really slow 

3

 and it took a really long time to do the traffic stop, 

4

 and he was able because of that to get another officer 

5

 in and do a dog sniff and it was all with  it's like 

6

 an additional limitation that, no, you have to be 

7

 diligent and you have to be reasonable in the way you 

8

 conduct the traffic stop.  And if you're not, the dog 

9

 sniff can't come in even though it was conducted during 

10

 the time the traffic stop occurred.  But it  that's 

11

 that's an additional constraint.  It's not some kind of 

12

 extra leeway for the police officers to do things 

13

 outside the bounds of the traffic stop itself. 

14

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, I think that's one way to 

15

 read Caballes's language.  The reason we don't think 

16

 that that's the right way is that we know after Caballes 

17

 that a dog sniff is not an independent Fourth Amendment 

18

 intrusion.  It's not a search.  We also know that it 

19

 doesn't impose  it doesn't violate any independent 

20

 scope limitation on traffic stops. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It is not a search, but 

22

 the  but the theory of Caballes and of all of our 

23

 questions is that you can't  and of all of our 

24

 cases  is that you really can't detain somebody if you 

25

 don't have some kind of objective reasonable basis for

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 doing so.  And that any detention  and, you know, it 

2

 might be ten minutes or it might be five minutes or it 

3

 might be two minutes  without that kind of basis is a 

4

 Fourth Amendment violation. 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

But once the individual is 

6

 already being detained for a traffic stop on probable 

7

 cause, I think the implication of Caballes is that 

8

 that if the dog sniff takes any time, then the intrusion 

9

 we're talking about is the incremental delay.  It's a 

10

 temporal intrusion.  And so from the individual's 

11

 perspective, her interest in  it's the same in 

12

 avoiding the dog sniff as it is in avoiding a warrant 

13

 check or any other incident of a stop.  It's the 

14

 interest against unreasonable delay.  And so because 

15

 that's the case, we think the delays attributable to 

16

 dog  sniffs should be treated like delays attributable to 

17

 a warrant check or anything else.  They should be 

18

 subject to 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You say  you've 

20

 said several times the phrase "incremental." In My  I 

21

 sense that it being less than, right?  I mean, if the 

22

 actual traffic stop is 5 minutes, then you wouldn't say 

23

 a 15minute dog sniff is incremental.  So doesn't the 

24

 dog sniff have to be less than the traffic stop? 

25

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think that  I think that

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 one of the things that courts should look to is the 

2

 relative proportion of time of the dog sniff to the rest 

3

 of the stop.  And I  the reason I think that is 

4

 relevant is that the officer  this is the case in 

5

 routine traffic stops as well  the officer has to be 

6

 reasonably diligent.  And so, I think reasonably 

7

 diligent can take into account whether the officer is 

8

 predominantly working on resolving the traffic 

9

 violation.  But if he is able to a dog sniff within a 

10

 reasonable amount of time and not have the traffic stop 

11

 exceed the duration of a reasonable, routine traffic 

12

 stop, then he ought to be able to do that. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is that  is that 

14

 almost always the case, that the dog sniff is going to 

15

 take longer than the traffic stop?  I mean, I would assume 

16

 so.  The officer says license and registration, goes 

17

 back, checks, comes back and gives you the ticket.  The 

18

 dog sniff is something else altogether.  Assuming the 

19

 dog is there, they've got to get  you know, walk 

20

 around the car.  If you're  if it really has to be 

21

 incremental, I'm not sure  it's hardly ever going to 

22

 be reasonable. 

23

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, the dog sniff itself, I 

24

 think, is a matter of seconds.  I think in the cases it 

25

 takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 90 seconds to do a dog

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 sniff.  So it is something that can be an incremental 

2

 delay as I 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

4

 to be there, I guess. 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

If the dog happens 

Well, even in a situation where 

6

 the dog isn't there already, I mean, the officer calls 

7

 for the dog early enough and the dog arrives.  I mean, 

8

 there are situations in cases  we cited this in 

9

 Footnote 20 of our brief where you have the dog arriving 

10

 just as the officer is about to give the ticket.  So 

11

 that is a scenario  that that can occur. 

12

 And I do think there are several reasons why 

13

 an officer may want to give the ticket first and then do 

14

 the dog sniff immediately.  And one of them is officer 

15

 safety.  I think everything that an officer does during 

16

 a traffic stop, how he orders his tasks and how he 

17

 performs them, is infused with officer safety 

18

 considerations.  And so it can be a safer thing to ask 

19

  to use the ticket, to explain the ticket as a non

20

 confrontational way of seeing about the car. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I see that.  What 

22

 about  another aspect is I was seeing it the way 

23

 Justice Kagan described it.  And one virtue of that, 

24

 now, but you may not think it does work, is 

25

 administrative.  What do you tell the police department?

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Say, well, when you're in traffic stops can you use dogs 

2

 to sniff?  Yeah, you can.  But remember, once it's over, 

3

 the traffic stop, it's over, done, finished.  And by the 

4

 way, if it isn't over yet, you still well may get into 

5

 trouble if you've unreasonably prolonged the stop just 

6

 to get the sniff. 

7

 Now, that seems pretty easy to explain. 

8

 It's fairly brightline.  And as soon as you get into 

9

 this other  you know, just leaving it totally open, 

10

 there's no check, really, on the  on the or not too 

11

 much of one.  What  you  now, I'm putting that to 

12

 you to get your response. 

13

 MS. ANDERS: 

So as I understand it you're 

14

 saying that  that, again, this is subject to a 

15

 reasonableness analysis, that the officer can do the dog 

16

 sniff and he can prolong the stop either before or after 

17

 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, I was saying two parts. 

19

 Part one, traffic stoppers, you can use a dog sniff when 

20

 you stop, but not once the stop is over, period, unless 

21

 you have cause or something.  And during the stop, 

22

 that's part two, you can't prolong it but for a reason. 

23

 You have to do it all within a reasonable time, okay? 

24

 You can't unreasonably prolong it to get your dog in. 

25

 See?  You tell them those two things.  Once you've told

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 them the two things, they've got it in their heads. 

2

 When this is over, goodbye dog. 

3

 MS. ANDERS: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well,  so that 
When it's not over, they 

5

 better be careful not to unreasonably prolong it.  Now, 

6

 they'll understand that, and it will be both protecting 

7

 what the Fourth Amendment protects and also, I think, 

8

 giving them enough leeway to conduct a traffic stop. 

9

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, so that makes the 

10

 officer's sequencing decision entirely dispositive of 

11

 whether the dog sniff can occur.  If it happens before 

12

 the stop, then it's fine; and after the stop, not.  I 

13

 think that does create arbitrary results from the 

14

 perspective of the intrusion on the individual.  But 

15

 from the officer's perspective, I think there's an 

16

 interest in officers having some leeway to sequence the 

17

 traffic stop. 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But the way Justice 

19

 Breyer has said this  what he's saying is you can't 

20

 unreasonably prolong.  You can't hold a person any 

21

 any measurable time that would allow to get the dog. 

22

 And, yes, it has to do with the resources of the police 

23

 department, but we can't keep bending the Fourth 

24

 Amendment to the resources of law enforcement. 

25

 Particularly when this stop is not  is not incidental

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 to the purpose of the stop.  It's purely to help the 

2

 police get more criminals, yes.  But then the Fourth 

3

 Amendment becomes a useless piece of paper. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I didn't understand 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think if I take what I 

6

 said and take your answer, I have to say your answer is 

7

 right.  It's just a bad effect of my rule.  And  and 

8

 the virtue of the, you know, the twopart rule is what 

9

 we said was the virtue of it.  And it's like in many 

10

 cases; there just isn't much more to say.  You have to 

11

 say, am I willing to run this  they might purposely 

12

 change the sequence.  They might, that's true.  Somebody 

13

 might.  And I don't know what to do about that.  The 

14

 answer is I couldn't do anything about it. 

15

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, we think there is a law 

16

 enforcement interest in officers having some leeway to 

17

 sequence the stop as they see fit.   As I was explaining 

18

 the reasons that an officer might want to give a ticket 

19

 contemporaneously with or before doing a dog sniff. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, he said 
Suppose, Ms. Anders, that 

22

 it's a hypothetical  police pulls somebody over and 

23

 starts the process and then the police officer says, you 

24

 know, I'd like a cigarette break now?  A cigarette 

25

 probably takes about as long as the dog sniff took in

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 this  and just, you know, smokes a cigarette and he 

2

 goes back to work.  All right?  Would you say that that 

3

 was unconstitutional prolongation of the stop. 

4

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, an officer always has to 

5

 be reasonably diligent.  So at a certain point if the 

6

 officer takes breaks for no valid law enforcement 

7

 reason, that is going to be dilatory and so the stop 

8

 would become unreasonable. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

10

 MS. ANDERS: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Okay. 
But, so I 
So it would become 

12

 unreasonable because there he was, he wasn't doing 

13

 anything related to the mission of the stop.  That's 

14

 true if he gave the ticket and then said, I want you to 

15

 stay while I take a cigarette break, or it's true if he 

16

 did it before he gave the ticket, either way. 

17

 I guess what I'm saying to you is I kind of 

18

 think it's the same thing, is that once you've 

19

 acknowledge that the dog sniff is something that's 

20

 extraneous to the stop itself  it's obviously more 

21

 helpful to the police than a cigarette break  but it's 

22

 extraneous to the stop itself  then the same rules 

23

 apply as if the police officer had just taken a 

24

 moratorium on the stop in the middle in order to conduct 

25

 his own business.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think when a traffic stop is 

2

 occurring, when an officer has someone stopped, we don't 

3

 expect them to ignore potential evidence of criminal 

4

 behavior.  In fact, we think they'd be remiss if they 

5

 did.  And so we think that if the officer is able to do 

6

 a dog sniff within a reasonable time, and is still 

7

 reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic stop 

8

 violation, it ought to be constitutionally permissible. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But then you really are 

10

 saying because we have a reason to pull you over for a 

11

 traffic stop, that gives us some extra time to start 

12

 questioning you about other law enforcementrelated 

13

 things and to do other law enforcementrelated business. 

14

 And I never thought that that was the rule.  I always 

15

 thought is that once the objective basis  you know, 

16

 for the stop, dissipated, that was it. 

17

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, I  I think if you take 

18

 unrelated questioning, for instance, questioning about 

19

 other  you know, other crime, other criminal activity, 

20

 I think there's a strong law enforcement interest in 

21

 officers having some leeway to pursue this within a stop 

22

 as long as it still is reasonable 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You told me the officer 

24

 could do that.  At least that's what I understood your 

25

 answer to be.

50

 MS. ANDERS: 

That's right, the officer can 

2

 do that.  And I think it's important that the officer 

3

 have some leeway so long as the overall time remains 

4

 reasonable.  If you think about questioning  if the 

5

 officer starts questions about where the person is going 

6

 and that kind of thing, you don't  we don't want 

7

 officers to have to make finelytuned judgements in the 

8

 moment about whether the next question he wants to ask 

9

 is sufficiently related to the traffic mission or not. 

10

 That's why we think there needs to be some leeway for the 

11

 officers to take some time to pursue  to pursue the 

12

 things that they observe.  As long as they can do that 

13

 within the amount of time that would be reasonable in a 

14

 routine traffic stop, then we think it should be 

15

 constitutionally reasonably to do that.  And I would say 

16

 that I think the reasonableness analysis  it allows 

17

 courts to calibrate based on the nature and severity of 

18

 the intrusion. 

19

 Under Petitioner's view, even a 30second 

20

 extension of a traffic stop for a dog sniff would be 

21

 unreasonable in every case.  But if you have a 

22

 reasonable analysis 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But what your  where your 

24

 rule is going to lead to, Ms. Anders, is something along 

25

 the lines of, like, everybody will decide 30 minutes or

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 40 minutes, I think you say at one point in your brief, 

2

 is reasonable for a traffic stop.  And if you see a 

3

 taillight violation, that's 40 minutes of free time for 

4

 the police officers to investigate any crimes that they 

5

 want, because they can do it all in the range of what 

6

 you've decided is kind of the reasonable traffic stop. 

7

 MS. ANDERS: 

I don't think that's how we 

8

 envision the analysis going, because the ultimate length 

9

 of time has to be within the duration of a routine 

10

 traffic stop that doesn't involve a dog sniff.  And 

11

 that's going to vary based on the circumstances because 

12

 routine traffic stops, what's reasonable varies based on 

13

 the circumstances.  So what we think courts can do is 

14

 they can look at what the officer actually did and they 

15

 can look to stops involving similar circumstances but 

16

 not dog sniffs, and determine whether the officer was 

17

 able to do the whole thing within a reasonable amount of 

18

 time. 

19

 I think that's essentially what the Court 

20

 contemplated in Ornelas, that with these Fourth 

21

 Amendment inquiries they're factspecific, but, you 

22

 know, the harder cases will be appealed and  and there 

23

 will start being guidelines, the courts can look to 

24

 similar indications. 

25

 We think the same thing can happen here, and

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 indeed it already has happened with respect to unrelated 

2

 questioning.  There, the vast majority of the courts of 

3

 appeals have said that you can extend a traffic stop for 

4

 unrelated questioning, and the courts have looked to how 

5

 much time does the questioning take, how long is the 

6

 overall stop, and was the officer reasonably diligent 

7

 with respect to the traffic mission. 

8
9

 And we think the same thing should happen 
 here, whether the dog sniff is before or after the 

10

 ticket.  That's the only rule that avoids arbitrary 

11

 results. 

12

 If there are no further questions

Thank you. 

 it.  I think the point was well made. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, then, what do you 

22

 think about her response?  Because I thought it was  I 

23

 mean, she has an interesting point  I mean, an 

24

 important point.  She said, you know, the trouble with 

25

 what I said  which of course you think is okay  she

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 said it's  it's  here's what's really going to 

2

 happen, is that the police will  will think:  Gee, I 

3

 just better be sure those dogs get here in time, and so 

4

 what they'll do is tend to prolong the stops, and 

5

 they'll want to be sure the dogs get there. 

6

 And so if you really added all this up 

7

 and thought about it, even experimentally, the class of 

8

 stopped drivers where there are hunches is going to end 

9

 up waiting longer and being in custody, in a sense, 

10

 longer than if we follow her approach.  And her approach 

11

 is just to say:  Hey, apply reasonableness across the 

12

 board; a few extra minutes isn't that big a deal. 

13

 I took her answer to be something like that 

14

 and I thought it was, and it's a point.  It's a  it's 

15

 a point.  So what do you think? 

16

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Well, we hope that if you 

17

 look at officers' diligence there are things that will 

18

 help enforce that.  One is the community.  Will the 

19

 community start to accept 40minute stops?  Will the law 

20

 enforcement officer himself expect that, I'm going to 

21

 stop being a police officer for 2, 3, 4 minutes when 

22

 there's other things going on?  I think that's very, 

23

 very, very significant. 

24
25

 Reasonableness  reasonableness stops when 
 you have the stop end.  At that point in time,

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 reasonableness has nothing more to do with it because 

2

 the person should be released until there is another 

3

 reason, another purpose for the stop, a reasonable 

4

 articulable suspicion, or you have consent.  Otherwise, 

5

 it is done. 

6

 Here's the problem with the reasonableness. 

7

 There was the  the statement that was made that it's 

8

 not reasonable, doesn't give the officers enough time. 

9

 We're not talking about the Fourth Amendment and the 

10

 officers and open season on the officers and what the 

11

 officers can do.  We're talking about the Fourth 

12

 Amendment and the protections that it has on the driver. 

13

 You don't look at, well, it's only going to be a minute 

14

 longer if you do it this way.  The Fourth Amendment 

15

 shuts it off when it is done. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What do you say about the 

17

 questioning that took place in this case?  Where are you 

18

 going?  Are you going to buy a car someplace?  All of 

19

 that, was that  is that part of the mission? 

20

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

We didn't raise that, Your 

21

 Honor.  Is that part of  of the mission?  It is 

22

 something that hasn't been  that hasn't been 

23

 challenged.  It has been accepted as being part of the 

24

 mission.  I will tell you that's what the courts say, 

25

 that it has been accepted as part of the mission.

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The  I have lots of questions before as to what is 

2

 part of the mission and how far you go.  That's for the 

3

 courts to  to determine. 

4

 My response, Your Honor 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, one of those courts is 

6

 this Court and what  that's what I don't understand 

7

 about your position, is the definition of the mission. 

8

 I don't understand  I can understand a definition that 

9

 says, just what you need to do to resolve the traffic 

10

 violation, period.  But if it includes other things like 

11

 questioning about where are you going to buy a car and 

12

 all of that or doing a records check, then I really 

13

 don't see why.  I want  I want to know what the 

14

 difference is between that and having a dog  a dog 

15

 sniff. 

16

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

Well, the other  the other 

17

 things that are tasked in part of the traffic offense 

18

 where there is no doubt  and that could be 

19

 questionable  but there's no doubt that a dog sniff is 

20

 not part of the offense.  That's collateral and it's 

21

 nothing but an  an investigation. 

22

 Now, the other  the last thing that 

23

 that I would like to do, Justice Ginsburg, is an 

24

 answer your question as to the Eighth Circuit, and the 

25

 Eighth Circuit did not make a decision as to the

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 probable cause.  But you do have a court that did.  The 

2

 trial level court did make that decision.  It made the 

3

 decision that it was probable cause. 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It was only a hunch, but 

5

 that would ordinarily be reviewable by the court of 

6

 appeals.  The court of appeals didn't get to it, so it's 

7

 an open question for the court of appeals. 

8
9

 MR. O'CONNOR: 

If it can go to the court of 

 appeals, but this is  I mean, you have the question 

10

 that it was based on a hunch, but you give the 

11

 discretion to the magistrate who heard the evidence. 

12

 And the magistrate had a question as to the credibility 

13

 of this witness, and if you have a question as to the 

14

 credibility of the witness then there is not sufficient 

15

 facts to  able to make a determination as to whether 

16

 in fact there is probable cause. 

17

 We would ask the Court to adopt the finding 

18

 that there is no probable cause.  That is something that 

19

 you can do as a reviewing court, because the facts have 

20

 been established.  We know that the  that the judge 

21

 had problems with the credibility of the witness.  The 

22

 facts that are left is not enough to  to establish any 

23

 type of reasonable suspicion. 

24
25

 What we do for judicial economy is you make 
 the decision here, now, because the Eighth Circuit would

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 have to do the same thing.  The Eighth Circuit would 


2


 have to make a decision based on the magistrate's 


3


 finding of lack of  of credibility, and that's what I 

4

 would ask the Court to do today.
