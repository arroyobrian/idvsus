We'll hear argument

Kansas v. Colorado.

General Six.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

11

MR. SIX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Article III makes a clear distinction

12

between the Court's appellate and original jurisdiction,

13

and expressly grants Congress power to make exceptions

14

and regulations for appellate jurisdiction, but Congress

15

is not granted the same power over original

16

jurisdiction.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's an extremely

18

sensitive clause in Article III.

We can decide this

19

case without relying on the distinction you just

20

discussed, can't we?

21

MR. SIX:

Well, I think can you, and the

22

Court certainly can interpret the statute not to even

23

reach the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and

24

avoid that constitutional conflict.

25

stronger reading of the statute arrives at that very

defined, "judge" and "court of the United States," and,

10

importantly, one term in 28 U.S.C. section 451 that is

12

that is "Justice of the United States."

On the other hand, it says "court of the

2

So why should we pick one -- one answer to the

3

contradiction rather than the other?

4

MR. SIX:

You don't have to pick.

And

5

you're correct, "the court of the United States" is

6

defined to include the Supreme Court.

7

reading of the statute gives meaning to all of the words

8

in the statute, and it says you can be a judge who

9

appears in the court of the United States.

But the strongest

And if you

10

think about it, there's a circle of judges that are

11

defined here and a circle of courts that are defined

12

here, and where the two overlap, where you are both a

13

judge and in the court of the United States, the statute

14

should apply.

22

with the Supreme Court Clerk.

23

the Supreme Court is treated differently than the lower

24

courts.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And throughout title 28,

Is 1911 a stand-alone

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

provision that would justify relief for you, or do we

2

have to also refer to the general cost statute?

3

MR. SIX:

I don't think the Court would

4

refer to the general cost statute in its original

5

jurisdiction cases at all or any authorization from

6

Congress.

7

28 U.S.C. 19 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but let's assume

8

that we think Congress can control this, this issue,

9

this question.

Now, I'm asking if 911 isn't a

10

stand-alone section so that you can interpret it without

11

reference to 1920.

12

MR. SIX:

I mean, I would -- if your

13

assumption is Congress has the power to do it and has

14

done so through 1911, I read 1911 more as simply a grant

15

of the discretion the Court already has.

17

clerk set costs.

MR. SIX:

No.

I don't believe you have to

refer to 1920.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why can't you rest your

case just on 1911?
MR. SIX:

Because in the original

jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Congress isn't given

power to make exceptions or regulations over original

2

jurisdiction.

3

original practice, they have never referred to a

4

congressional cost provision, and -

5

And in the 219 years of the Court's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you saying that 1911

6

doesn't cover expert witness fees because it's not

7

included within the term "other necessary

8

disbursements"?

9
10

MR. SIX:

I believe the expert witness fees

in this case were vital to the resolution.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. SIX:

13
14
15

incidental disbursements.

That's not our position.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Other necessary

disbursements.
MR. SIX:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

Were they within 1911?

I don't believe they were other

16

18

They were -

Other necessary disbursements.
Incidental to the case.

You don't that think that covers expert witness fees?
MR. SIX:

If -- if this Court determines

20

that Congress has the power, and it's done so through -

21

since 1911 -- has the power and done it from 1911, I

22

certainly would accept that position as the result.

23

However, I would point out to the Court that I think the

24

expert witness costs and the work was vital to the

25

resolution of the case here.

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you're reading of the

2

statute is correct, then I take it we would have the

3

discretion to decide what would be appropriate expert

4

fees.

Is that correct?

5

MR. SIX:

Absolutely.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

If that's so, why shouldn't

7

we exercise that discretion by saying that the expert

8

fees that are available in case of the original

9

jurisdiction of this Court should be the same as the

10

expert fees that would be available in a district court?

11

Maybe they are too low in the district court, but why

12

should there be -- why should we as a discretionary

13

matter, if we have the discretion, provide for radically

14

different fees depending on the court in which the case

15

originates?

16

MR. SIX:

Clearly the Court has the power to

17

make that rule for original cases.

However, the

18

original jurisdiction was developed when the States

19

agreed to submit and ratify the Constitution, submit

20

their sovereign immunity to resolution in the original

21

jurisdiction to handle unique disputes between the

22

sovereign States.

would save $40 a day.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We are saying it's our

has suggested so there is uniformity in the system and

so forth.

I certainly can't speak to whether it's

Certainly 1920 makes a

I think the important point to consider,

10

though, is in the original jurisdiction the Court in its

11

219 years of developing essentially an interstate common

12

law in these cases has never relied on the trilogy of

13

cost statutes that the court discussed in Crawford

14

Fitting, with is I essentially Colorado's position:

15

have to apply Rule 54D first to have the court even have

16

the discretion to award costs; then you get to 1920,

17

which the Court said is the arena of costs; and only

18

after that do you get down to 1821, which tells you

19

you're limited to $40 a day.

Court to make an order that the Special Master be paid X

13

that this Court simply has the inherent authority to, to

10

MR. SIX:

Well, again there is a distinction

11

between appellate and original and, focusing on

12

original, I think the Court has entirely the authority.

The Judiciary Act of 1789, which gave the Court

practice is for the parties to settle this matter and

is the Special Master has provided guidance, like on the

3

MR. SIX:

In original cases the Court has

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But have they ever

approved a Special Master's recommendation of a rate for

However,

from a fair reading of the -- the water distribution

that without experts.

But I would point the Court to

Alderson Reporting Company

the boundary dispute cases where the Court has discussed

2

the costs of surveyors, mappers, geographers,

3

historians, and divided the cost in boundary disputes

4

equally between the States -- not each State to bear

5

their own cost, but divided them equally.

6

And the -- the experts that are involved in

7

resolving a boundary dispute, I think, are no different

than the hydrologists and engineers and the type of

JUSTICE BREYER:

But one point

Well, can we do this then?

14

I think maybe in many cases that are technical in nature

15

it might be quite a good thing for the losing party to

pay the winning side's lawyers.

don't we have them, the losing side, pay the lawyers'

fees?

If we are going to have them pay the experts, why

That would be quite a revolution.
MR. SIX:

Because in the original

jurisdiction cases involving prevailing parties or

25

litigious cases, the Court has traditionally and

historically awarded the prevailing party costs.

Congress can make a congressional limitation on cost,

MR. SIX:

Well, as the case progressed, the

reasons and special circumstances that should allow the

1821 of Title 28 is unambiguous.

It provides that a

addition to travel and accommodation allowances.

Section 451 of Title 28 defines "court of

Justice Ginsburg, we -- we

5

looked at it very carefully -- and it's difficult to

6

research -- but we could not find an original

7

jurisdiction case where there was an award of witness

8

fees outside the -- this $40 per day limitation.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did you find any cases

10

where the special master had appointed his own witness

11

as distinguished from the parties?

12

MR. SUTHERS:

No.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We did not.

But -

But you -- but you

recognize that if a special master appointed a witness,

compensatory fee?

MR. SUTHERS:

Whatever the special master

determined was appropriate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct.
Now, in a -- in a case

20

like this one, where the nature of the work that the

21

expert did seemed to be very helpful to both sides,

22

isn't it odd that the special master chose the court

expert, that expert would be compensated fairly but if

you have one party calls an expert who renders great

Do you -- may I ask you a

determination of a particular item under section 1920:

14

Judge and clerk of any court of the United States may

15

tax its cost.

16

covered by 1920, one of the items that a judge or clerk

17

may tax, is fees of the clerk.

18

As -- as you have pointed out, if the $40

My question is this.

One of the items

Under section 1911, which relates entirely

19

to the Supreme Court, there is a provision that the

20

Supreme Court may fix the fees to be charged by its

21

clerk.

22

Supreme Court of the United States.

23

That is totally redundant if 1920 covers the

Doesn't it follow, therefore, that section

24

1920 was -- despite its reference to any court of the

25

United States, doesn't it follow that that statute was
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not intended to apply to the Supreme Court; and doesn't

2

it follow from that that either the Supreme Court's

3

authority is to fix the fees if this is a fee to be

4

charged by the clerk or, in the alternative, that there

5

is no statute on it at all?

6

But the main point is unless 1911 is totally

7

redundant in -- in referring to fixing the fees to be

8

charged by its clerk, then 1920 must not cover the

9

Supreme Court.

10

MR. SUTHERS:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. SUTHERS:

further.

2

MR. SUTHERS:

Justice Souter, I think if you

3

look at the history of it, 1911 was enacted at the

4

same -- there is a separate statute -- statute that

5

applies to the court of appeals and to the district

6

courts.

I don't think that you can -

redundancy it proves too much is what you're saying?

10

MR. SUTHERS:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. SUTHERS:

Okay.

I think the important thing

13

about 1911, in response to Justice Kennedy's question,

14

it is limited to fees charged by the Supreme Court

15

clerk, cost of serving process and incidental

16

disbursements.

17
18

It does not address witness fees in -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
printing fees?

Do you think it includes

think that -

22

MR. SUTHERS:

Incidental disbursements?

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- what number here?

You

24

don't think that 1911 would allow the clerk to charge

25

for printing fees?

2

MR. SUTHERS:
it may.

3

As an incidental disbursement,

But it clearly does not address witness fees.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the reason I ask is

4

because printing, in 1920, printing and witness fees are

5

in -- in the same sentence.

6
7

MR. SUTHERS:

printing would be considered incidental disbursements.

8
9

And I -- I don't know whether

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So if you allowed

printing, then I think it would allow witnesses under

10

1911. Citing Crawford Fitting, this Court made clear

11

that no statute will be construed to authorize taxing

12

witness fees and costs, unless it refers explicitly to

13

witness fees.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is -- I mean, if you

15

want to really get a little complicated, the -- you

the other fees, right?

20

some authorization, but 1911 gives the Supreme Court

21

some authorization to fix fees.

22

Okay.

So the thing is, you

Now we look back at 1821.

And 1821 tells

you how much mileage per diem and subsistence will be.

MR. SUTHERS:

Well, in the case of the -- of

the Court appointing an expert, it is typical at the

If I may, once again going to

the issue of why I think some uniformity is important in

original jurisdiction cases, is because so many of the

15

cases are not exclusive jurisdiction; and there is in

16

fact a need for uniformity here; and the fact that this

Court has not chosen to issue a conflicting rule, I

18

think is very significant.

If in fact you had set an appropriate fee

for expert witness fees in case original jurisdiction,

21

and Congress came along and said gee, no; it shouldn't

be that, you should be stuck with $40, then we might

12

does it -- how come it disappears whenever Congress

13

decides to legislate in the area?

MR. SUTHERS:

Because Congress is

entitled -- you've recognized their right to deal with

certain types of issues.

17

that Kansas cited Ford v Georgia, because that case says

18

Congress has undoubtedly the right to prescribe the

process and mode of proceeding in original jurisdiction

cases as fully as in other Federal courts, but that the

omission to legislate such process does not deprive the

would that statute be constitutional in your view?

not be because then it's interfering with your ability

Isn't that a pretty

slippery slope then that you're on?

parties are going to be reluctant to -- to hire the kind

of experts that are necessary, unless they think that at

the end of the day there is going to be some kind of an

starts interfering with the conduct of the kind of

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE SIX

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

4

MR. SIX:

1920 didn't appear in 1948

5

magically.

It came from the 1853 Fee Act.

6

language in the Fee Act was, "A judge shall tax costs."

7

"A judge" -- it says, "Costs shall be taxed by a judge

8

or clerk of the court."

9

judge or clerk of any court of the United States."

I'm sorry.

14

judge" who can tax costs -- and we have a definition

15

that Congress tells us it means exactly the same thing.

16

It says that

And "judge" in 1853 meant a lower court

In 1920, we have exactly the same word -- "a

Under Colorado's reading "court of the

17

United States" would expand to read "judge" right out of

18

the statute, and it would make the statute apply to

19

"magistrate judge," for example, which is not included

20

in the definition, but they're somebody who wears a robe

21

and presides over a court of the United States, and it

22

would apply to Justices, even though 451 in title 28

23

defines "Justices" as a separate group.

24

--

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that's not

But the Constitution uses

the word "judge."

2

Supreme Court Justice or a judge of an inferior court.

3

A "judge of the United States" is a

MR. SIX:

And certainly Congress isn't tied

4

to the way the word is used in the Constitution, no more

5

than the paper I got on my way in here told me not to

6

refer to any of you as "judges."

7

The point, I think, is that the Fee Act was

8

carried forward to 1920, and the language is almost the

9

same.

The only thing they have added is a definition of

10

"court of the United States."

11

Congress is going to tread on the Court's original

12

jurisdiction, they ought to at least have some express

13

language that they intend to do that -- do so, where the

14

Court could at the very least adopt a clear statement

15

rule that would require Congress to say, "We are going

16

to do this now.

17

now after 168 years we are."

18

And if after 168 years,

We've never done it in our history, but

Not only that, Colorado's position relies on

the fact that they did this in 1948, and it's gone
