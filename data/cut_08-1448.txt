CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association.

Mr. Morazzini.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MORAZZINI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

The California law at issue today before

12

this Court differs from the New York law at issue in

13

Ginsberg in only one respect:

14

concerned with minors' access to harmful sexual material

15

outside the guidance of a parent, California is no less

16

concerned with a minor's access to the deviant level of

17

violence that is presented in a certain category of

18

video games that can be no less harmful to the

19

development of minors.

20

Where New York was

When this Court in Ginsberg crafted a rule

21

of law that permits States to regulate a minor's access

22

to such material outside the presence of a parent, it

23

did so for two fundamental reasons that are equally

24

applicable this morning in this case.

25

First, this rule permits parents' claim to
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

authority in their own household to direct the

2

upbringing and the development of their children; and,

3

secondly, this rule promotes the States' independent

4

interest in helping parents protect the well-being of

5

children in those instances when parents cannot be

6

present.
So this morning, California asks this Court

7
8

to adopt a rule of law that permits States to restrict

9

minors' ability to purchase deviant, violent video games

10

that the legislature has determined can be harmful to

11

the development and the upbringing -

MR. MORAZZINI:

Not at all, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What's the difference?

I

5

mean, if you -- if you are supposing a category of

6

violent materials dangerous to children, then how do you

7

cut it off at video games?

8

about comic books?

What about films?

Grimms' fairy tales?

Why are video games special?

9

What

Or does your

10

principle extend to all deviant, violent materials in

11

whatever form?
MR. MORAZZINI:

12

No, Your Honor.

That's why

13

I believe California incorporated the three prongs of

14

the Miller standard.

15

It's not just patently offensive violence.

16

violence that meets all three of the terms set forth

17

in -

So it's not just deviant violence.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

I think that misses

19

Justice Ginsburg's question, which was:

20

21

It's

Why just video

Why not movies, for example, as well?
MR. MORAZZINI:

Sure, Your Honor.

The

22

California Legislature was presented with substantial

23

evidence that demonstrates that the interactive nature

24

of violent -- of violent video games where the minor or

25

the young adult is the aggressor, is the -- is the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

individual acting out this -- this obscene level of

2

violence, if you will, is especially harmful to minors.

3

It -

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, do you actually have

5

studies that show that video games are more harmful to

6

minors than movies are?

7

MR. MORAZZINI:

Well, in the record, Your

8

Honor, I believe it's the Gentile and Gentile study

9

regarding violent video games as exemplary teachers.

10

The authors there note that video games are not only

11

exemplary teachers of pro-social activities, but also

12

exemplary teachers of aggression, which was the

13

fundamental concern of the California Legislature in

14

enacting this statute.

15

So, while the science is continually

16

developing -- indeed, it appears that studies are being

17

released every month regarding -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What was the -

And suppose -- suppose a new

20

study suggested that movies were just as violent.

21

presumably, California could regulate movies just as it

22

could regulate video games.

23

MR. MORAZZINI:

Then,

Well, Your Honor, there is

24

scientific literature out there regarding the impact of

25

violent media on -- on children.

In fact, for decades,

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the President, Congress, the FTC, parenting groups have

2

been uniquely concerned with the level of violent media

3

available to minors that they have ready access to.

4

So -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

I don't know -- is that

6

answering Justice Kagan's question?

7

the Anderson study, says that the effect of violence is

8

the same for a Bugs Bunny episode as it is for a violent

9

video.

10

One of the studies,

So can the legislature now, because it has that

study, say we can outlaw Bugs Bunny?

11

MR. MORAZZINI:

No -

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And there are people who

13

would say that the cartoon has very little social value;

14

it's entertainment but not much else.

have said, oh, we've had violence in Grimms' fairy

tales, but we've never had it, you know, live on the

4

screen.

5

you can make that argument.

I mean, every time there's a new technology,

the Miller standard into California's law.

This

10

narrow category of material will be covered, certainly

11

not Grimms' fairy tales.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

How is this any

13

different than what we said we don't do in the First

14

15

at a category of speech and decide that some of it has

However -
Why isn't that obscene

in the sense that you're using the word, or deviant?
MR. MORAZZINI:

17

Well, I'm not sure initially

18

that it's directly harmful to the development of minors

19

in the way that we know that violent video games can be.

20

We know that violent material, like sexual material,

21

appeals to a base instinct in -- in especially minors.

22

It has -- it can be presented in a manner that -
JUSTICE ALITO:

25

about?

If a video game manufacturer has to decide under

2

of -- of a child should the manufacturer have in mind?

A 17-year-old?

A 10-year-old?

MR. MORAZZINI:

Your Honor, I would submit

5

that, just like in the obscenity context for minors, a

6

law similar to the New York law at issue in Ginsberg,

7

though California's law hasn't been construed or

8

applied, I would submit that the jury would be

instructed to consider minors as a whole.

Because the average minor

is halfway between 0 and 18, is that 9 years old?

Fair point, Justice Scalia.

I think a jury could be instructed as to the typical age

11

group of minors that are -- that are playing these

12

games.
JUSTICE BREYER:

13

Why wouldn't you, if

14

necessary, simply say that -- that a -- a video game

15

that appeals to the prurient, shameful, or morbid

16

interests of those 18 or under, but let's take 18, and

17

it's not suitable in the community for those 18, and it

18

has no redeeming importance of any kind, no serious

19

literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for

20

those 18, that at least as to those, you can't sell it

without -- the parent can buy it, but the child can't

that would be horrible for an 18-year-old.

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Justice Breyer, absolutely.
Okay.
Mr. Morazzini, could I take

4

you back to Justice Scalia's original question, which

5

was what counts as deviant violence or morbid violence?

6

Because I read your briefs all the way through, and the

7

only thing that I found was -- you said was clearly

8

covered by this statute was Postal 2.

9

the statute applies to more than one video game.

10

what else does it apply to?

11

kind of video games?

But presumably
So

How many video games?

What

I mean, how would you describe in plain

12
13

English what -- what morbid violence is, what you have

14

to see in a video game for it to be covered?
MR. MORAZZINI:

15

Okay, Justice Kagan, I would

16

go back to the language of the statute, and the statute

17

covers video games where the range of options available

18

to the player includes maiming, killing, dismembering,

19

torturing, sexually assaulting, and those types of

20

violence.

21
22
23

So I would look to games where -
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So anything that has those

kinds of violence counts?
MR. MORAZZINI:

No, and then we would move

to the three prongs of the Miller standard, Your Honor.

We would look to see what -

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, so how do we separate

2

violent games that are covered from violent games just

3

as violent that are not covered?
MR. MORAZZINI:

jury could be instructed with expert testimony, with

video clips of game play, and to judge for

7

themselves whether -

So is what's covered here

Is that what

rated games would be covered, but not all.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

material to judge whether or not it's a -- it's in -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

Let me just make one

14

comment on that point.

It seems to me all or at least

15

the great majority of the questions today are designed

16

to probe whether or not this statute is vague.

17

say the beauty of the statute is that it utilizes the

18

categories that have been used in the obscenity area and

19

that -- that there's an obvious parallel there.

And you

The problem is, is that for generations

20
21

material.

24

offensive for sexual material, and there are judicial

25

discussions on it.

Sex and violence have both been around a long

Now, those judicial discussions are

there are certain -- that there are certain materials

7

significant degree as well.

Those rules are not precise at

But you're asking us to go into an entirely

new area where there are no consensus, no judicial

10

opinions.

And this is -- and this indicates to me the

11

statute might be vague, and I just thought you'd like to

12

know that -- that reaction.

13

14

MR. MORAZZINI:

Justice Kennedy, as with

15

sexual -- the regulation of sexual material and

16

obscenity, we had to start somewhere.

17

choosing to start now.

18

what level of violence is in fact patently offensive for

19

minors, is deviant for minors, just as the case law has

20

developed over time with sexual depictions.

I believe the key is the -- the similarities violence

22

has with sex.

We can build a consensus as to

Your Honor,

This is material -

24

glorification of drinking, movies that have too much

I

suppose so.
I -- I am not just concerned with the

2
3

vagueness.

I am concerned with the vagueness, but I'm

4

concerned with the First Amendment, which says Congress

5

shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.

6

it was always understood that the freedom of speech did

7

not include obscenity.

8

that the freedom of speech did not include portrayals of

9

violence.

And

It has never been understood

You're -- you're asking us to create a -- a

11

whole new prohibition which the American people never -

20

evidence that suggests, that our Founding Fathers, in

enacting the First Amendment, intended to guarantee

22

video game retailers' First Amendment right -

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I go back to -- to

what Justice Breyer was asking?

Because this Court,

25

with respect to the fighting words -- Chaplinsky and "in

2

has been very careful to cordon that off so it doesn't

MR. MORAZZINI:

Your analogy is to

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

With

7

regard to fighting words, the -- the societal interest

in preventing acts of violence is -- is different than

9

the concern at issue here today.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

So could I just make -- make

11

sure I understand that, Mr. Morazzini, because, as I

12

understand, the State has given up its argument that the

13

interest protected by this law is an interest in

14

preventing minors who see these games from going out and

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

8
9
10

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The California law at issue restricts the

11

distribution of expressive works based on their content.

12

California, as we've heard today, does not seriously

13

contend that it can satisfy the usual First Amendment

14

standards that apply to such a law.

15

asking this Court to grant it a new free pass, a

16

brand-new Ginsberg-like exception to the First Amendment

17

that would deny constitutional protection to some

18

ill-defined subset of expressive works and, I submit,

19

not just video games, but necessarily movies, books, and

20

any other expressive work that describes or portrays

21

violence in a way that some court somewhere, some day,

22

would decide is deviant and offensive.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Instead, it's

What about -- the

24

distinction between books and movies may be that, in

25

these video games, the child is not sitting there
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

passively watching something; the child is doing the

2

killing.

3

that might be understood to have a different impact on

4

the child's moral development.

The child is doing the maiming.

MR. SMITH:

5

And I suppose

Well, Your Honor, it might.

The

6

-- the State of California has not marshaled a shred of

7

evidence to suggest it's true.

8

social science -

And if you look at the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

What was -- what was

10

the state of the record that was present before the

11

Court in Ginsberg?
MR. SMITH:

12

The state of the record was that

13

they were aware of science on both sides, but made a

14

judgment that as a matter of common sense, they could

15

decide that obscenity, even somewhat at-large

16

obscenity -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17
18

So the Court acted

on the basis of common sense?
MR. SMITH:

19

Yes.

It said as long as there's

20

science on both sides, but in that particular area,

21

which is an exception based -- that goes back to the

22

founding, they felt that it was -- it was proper for

23

them to adjust the outer boundaries of the exception.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24
25

obscene.

But the material wasn't

7

Well -

But they were definitely not obscene with

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, that's

8

certainly true, but one of the things about the case

9

that is important to recognize, they didn't pass on the

10

particular material before the Court.

11

is this somewhat larger a definition of variable

12

obscenity going to be acceptable to -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

They simply said,

Talking about common sense,

14

why isn't it common sense to say that if a parent wants

15

his 13-year-old child to have a game where the child is

16

going to sit there and imagine he's a torturer and

17

impose gratuitous, painful, excruciating, torturing

18

violence upon small children and women, and do this for

19

an hour or so, and there is no social or redeeming

20

value, it's not artistic, it's not literary, et

21

cetera -- why isn't it common sense to say a State has

22

the right to say, parent, if you want that for your

23

13-year-old, you go buy it yourself.

24

what they're saying.

25

MR. SMITH:

Which I think is

Well, Your Honor, the State has
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

to have some reason to think that parents -
JUSTICE BREYER:

It does, it does.

What it

3

has is -- and I've looked at the studies, perhaps not as

4

thoroughly as you, but it seemed to me that Dr. Ferguson

5

and Dr. Anderson are in a disagreement.

6

that much of a disagreement actually, but they've looked

7

in depth at a whole lot of video games, not movies

8

they're talking about or other things; they're talking

9

about video games.

10

They aren't in

And both groups come to the conclusion that

11

there is some tendency to increase violence.

12

13

the American Pediatric Association sign on to a long

14

list on -- I think it's the Anderson side that this does

15

hurt children.

16

And the

I have to admit that if I'm supposed to be a

17

sociological expert, I can't choose between them.

18

if I can say could a legislature have enough evidence to

19

think there's harm, the answer is yes.

20

MR. SMITH:

But

There is two aspects of harm.

21

The one I was about to address was the question of

22

whether parents need additional help in exercising the

23

role that they have played throughout the history -

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

They need additional

help because many parents are not home when their
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

children come home from school.

2

I -- we hope.

3

are there, they do what they want.

4

is, if you want that gratuitous torture of, let's say

5

babies, to make it as bad as possible, what you do,

6

parent, is you go buy it; don't let him buy it on his

7

own, and he's 13 years old.

8

sense or what's the science of that?

9

Many parents have jobs,

And -- and when -- when their children

MR. SMITH:

And all this says

Now, what's the common

Well, two aspects.

With respect

10

to parental controls, Your Honor, there's a whole

11

variety -- a whole series of things that parents have

12

available to them and are using today to deal with any

13

concerns that they have about what's appropriate for

14

their children.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't want to

16

interrupt your answer, but any 13-year-old can bypass

17

parental controls in about 5 minutes.

18

MR. SMITH:

That is one element of about

19

five different elements, Your Honor.

20

talk about them -- there is the ratings.

21

doing the purchasing 90 percent of the time.

22

the child does the purchasing, they bring the game home,

not even tried to show -- they are very likely in the

The -

what common sense is there in having a state of the law

aspects of this that I think it's important to

of works that we create for children and encouraged them

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

There is a difference.

And -- and parents have been

doing that for -- since time immemorial.

15

before this Court is whether you're going to create an

16

entirely new exception under the First Amendment,

17

whether parents need to have such a new exception

exception is.

Is it your position

22

MR. SMITH:

My position is that most people

minors -- we do not try to sell it to minors -- but that

4

the Constitution should not be -

-- is that there is not a

12

violence exception to the First Amendment for minors,

13

and there should not be.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your position is

15

that the First Amendment does not, cannot, no matter

16

what type of law, whether this one is vague or not, that

17

the State legislature cannot pass a law that says you

18

may not sell to a 10-year-old a video in which they set

19

schoolgirls on fire.

20

21

there's no possible way, it's an insuperable problem, to

use the English language to draw up an exception to the

judgments that they make about their children at

harm.

MR. SMITH:

We do have a new medium here,

mediums coming along and people vastly overreacting to

14

them, thinking the sky is falling, our children are all

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Smith, do you think all

2

video games are speech in the first instance?

Because

3

you could look at these games and say they're the

4

modern-day equivalent of Monopoly sets.

5

They're things that people use to compete.

6

when you think about some of them -- the first video

7

game was Pong.

8

is that speech at all?

9

MR. SMITH:

They're games.
You know,

It was playing tennis on your TV.

How

The games that we are talking

10

about have narrative, events that are occurring,

11

characters, plot.

12

set out to regulate here.

13

here -- there is violence, one person is hurting another

14

person -- it has to be a human being who's the victim -

15

and it's doing it in a -- in a way that they find

16

offensive in some way, we're going to regulate it.

17

obviously, what -

And that's exactly what the State has
It says if these events occur

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

So,

So are we going to separate

19

video games into narrative video games and non-narrative

20

video games?

21

MR. SMITH:

You don't have to, as long as

22

the law is limited to regulating narrative.

That's what

23

this law is limited to.

24

shouldn't buy -- play games that have red images that

25

appear in them, or something else that was somehow

Now, if the law said you

non-content based, that might be a closer case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what -- what about a

3

law that says you can't sell to minors a video game -

4

it doesn't care what the plot is, but no video game in

5

which the minor commits violent acts of maiming,

6

killing, setting people on fire?

7

Would that -- would that be regulating speech?

8
9
10
11

MR. SMITH:

What about that?

Well, of course, Your Honor.

That's exactly what -- what -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not speech.

You're

saying you just can't let the kid maim -- maim, kill -

12

MR. SMITH:

I'm sorry.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Were you -

-- or set on fire.

What

14

the law would be directed at is not the plot, not the

15

video game itself, but the child's act of -- of

16

committing murder, maiming, and so forth.

17

MR. SMITH:

Well, the events in a video game

18

are -- what happens in the plot is a combination of what

19

the game gives you and what the player adds to it.

20

There's a -- there's a creative aspect coming at it from

21

the other side.

22

between the player and the game.

23

both are completely protected by the First Amendment.

24

Just as a person actually -

I would submit that

No.

The child is helping to

make the plot, determine what happens in the events that

appear on the screen, just as an actor helps to portray

what happens in a play.

6

elements of the play, and you're contributing to the

7

events that occur and adding a creative element of your

own.

wonderful.

That's what makes them different and in many ways

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

You're acting out certain

Mr. Smith, your -

your challenge is a facial challenge?

12

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that under -

14

whether you use the Salerno test or the Glucksberg test,

15

if there is either one or any applications that would

16

satisfy the Constitution, the facial challenge fails.

17

Right?

18

MR. SMITH:

Very clear under the law of this

19

Court that those tests don't apply in a First Amendment

20

context if the -- the -

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought we

22

referenced them last year in the Stevens case, and the

23

only reason we didn't have to decide which applies is

24

because we adopted an approach that looked at

25

overbreadth and said this statute is overbroad and
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

specifically didn't decide whether it could be applied

2

in that case to -- to crush videos.

3

MR. SMITH:

Well, that's -- that's correct,

4

Your Honor, but I think it's -- there's no argument

5

here, I don't think, that if you can find one game out

6

there to which this can constitutionally be applied,

7

even though it would also be unconstitutionally applied

8

under the vast run of other cases -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I

10

understood -- the tenor of much of the questioning, I

11

think, is that there may be games and may be minors -

12

maybe a less violent game sold to a 17-year-old, perhaps

13

that violates the First Amendment, but something like

14

Postal 2 sold to a 10-year-old might -- might well not

15

violate the First Amendment to apply this law to that.

16

MR. SMITH:

Well, that may be -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the way we

18

approached the issue in Stevens, where we had hunting

19

videos and crush videos, would say that it's too broad

20

to apply the law to everything, so we strike it down,

21

it's overbroad, but leave open the possibility that a

22

more narrowly drawn statute might pass muster.

23

Why -- why isn't that a good approach here?

24

MR. SMITH:

25

You certainly could do that.

Certainly, the key thing is that you strike down this
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

law, because this law is clearly much broader than any

2

one game.

3

no way, in fact, anybody is going to be able to come

4

back and draw a statute that gets to what they claim,

5

because the English language is not susceptible of that

6

level of precision.

I would submit to you, though, that there's

You have some experts who -- who favor

point's a pretty good one and a serious one, that it's

very hard to draw this line under traditional First

13

for a moment.

And I take it their point is:

things like torturing children, et cetera.

don't like to sell them to anybody.

20

or some special thing.

21

within a Miller-type definition.

22

than the simple girlie magazine that was involved there.

23

And they will use traditional First Amendment tests;

24

that is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is

25

being limited, it is being done for a good reason,

There is a

compelling interest -- namely, this problem with the X

videos and the torture and living it through -- and

3

there is no less restrictive alternative that isn't also

4

significantly less effective.

because what you have been doing for the most part is

saying we have to be in some new, total new area, et

about that, specifically.

that there's any existing exception to the First

think if you apply strict scrutiny here, they do not

come close to the kind of showing that would be required

under -- under the First Amendment.

4

First of all, they have not shown any

5

problem, let alone a compelling problem, requiring

6

regulation here in a world where parents are fully

7

empowered already to make these calls, where crime,

8

including violent crime, since the introduction of these

9

games, has been plummeting in this country, down 50

10

percent since the day Doom first went on the market

11

15 years ago; in a world where parents are fully aware

12

of what's going on in their homes and aware of the

ratings system and can use all the other tools that we

obscenity doesn't have strict scrutiny applied to it, if

it did, I expect you could make the same arguments, if

22

there were -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why shouldn't violence be

treated the same as obscenity?

don't have the same history of it.

2

historical pedigree of that kind of an exception.

3

as I was suggesting earlier, there's a fundamental

4

difference factually, which is Ginsberg works tolerably

well because we take everything that's sexually explicit

and appeals to a prurient interest, and we say over

arguments with reference to obscenity.
MR. SMITH:

Except that you know -- we know,

13

we all know, at least with respect to Ginsberg -- adult

14

obscenity, I would acknowledge, is a very difficult

15

line.

16

if it has sex in it and naked people having sex in it

17

and it's designed to be appealing to people's prurient

18

interests, you don't give it to minors.

19

have a lot of cases out there about that.

20

Adult -- Ginsberg works reasonably well, because

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, and you started

21

Ginsberg with something that is proscribable even with

22

regard to adults.

You know that there is such

a thing as -- as obscenity, which can be proscribed even

Alderson Reporting Company

-- even as to adults; whereas in this case, I don't know

2

that there's such a thing as morbid violence which could

3

be eliminated from ordinary movies.
MR. SMITH:

4

Let me -- I think a little

5

history is helpful here.

This Court has twice dealt

6

with laws attempting to regulate violent works in the

7

past.

8

to magazines and books, and one was in the 1960s.

9

the very day Ginsberg came down, in the Interstate

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me be clear about

15

exactly what your argument is.

Your argument is that

16

there is nothing that a State can do to limit minors'

17

access to the most violent, sadistic, graphic video game

that can be developed.

19

MR. SMITH:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. SMITH:

That's your argument?
My position is -
Is it or isn't it?

My position is that strict

22

scrutiny applies, and that given the facts in the

23

record, given the fact that the -- the problem is

24

already well controlled, the parents are already

25

empowered, and there are greatly less alternatives out

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

State can do.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Mr. Smith, how can you

17

say that?

There's plenty of proof that -- that children

18

are going into stores and buying these games despite the

19

voluntary rating system, despite the voluntary retailer

20

restraint by some.

21

an abundance of it, that kids are buying the games.

There's still proof out there, and

22

MR. SMITH:

I disagree.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And there's proof that

24

some parents, as well-intentioned as they may or may not

25

be, have not been able to supervise that.
49
Alderson Reporting Company

So I -

Official

1

starting from the proposition that there is a problem,

it's a compelling State need, why are you arguing that

there is no solution that the State could use to address

The -- the existing solutions

are perfectly capable of allowing this problem to be

evidence at all in this record that actual children, not

The question is, you say the record doesn't

support the idea that these video games are harmful to

11

children.

Some of us may conclude that it does.
MR. SMITH:

12

Well, surely the record doesn't

13

support it.

The record says that if -- even if you take

14

the studies at face value, it's not one whit more

15

harmful than watching television cartoons.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

score, Mr. Smith, there is a study by the FCC.

question is whether violence can be restricted during

pornography is.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doing for sex, except we don't think we ought to do it;

2

we think Congress should do it?

3

MR. SMITH:

What they did was they spent

4

several years trying to come up with a definition that

5

would allow anybody to figure out which violent TV shows

6

have to be put into this adult category and which don't,

7

and they eventually punted and said we have no idea how

8

to do that; Congress asked us to do it; we cannot do it;

9

and they punted it back to Congress to try to come up

10

with a definition.

11

This is a very difficult task, trying to use

12

language to differentiate levels of violence or types of

13

violence in a manner that would in some way tell people

14

what the rules of the game are.

15

think that there's some problem out there that needs to

16

be solved, you ought to think very carefully about

17

whether or not you're going to authorize the creation of

18

some new rule authorizing regulation in this area, when

19

no one will have any idea what the scope of it is.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think, even if you

And you say there's no

21

problem because 16-year-olds in California never have

22

$50 available to go buy a video game and because they

23

never have TVs in their room, and their parents are

24

always home watching what they -- they do with their

25

video games, and the parents -- and the video games have
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

features that allow parents to block access, to block

2

the playing of violent video games, which can't be

3

overcome by a computer-savvy California 16-year-old;

4

that's why there's no problem, right?
MR. SMITH:

5

I guess, if what we're really

6

going to do is judge the constitutionality of this law

7

based on what 16- and 17-year-olds are getting and

8

whether that would be harmful to them, I think the

9

problem there is the line between 16 and 17 and 18 is so

10

fine, that you're not going to be able to identify any

11

real category of games that fits into that category.

12

And it's important, by the way, to -- to

13

note that California hasn't told us whether we should

14

judge it for 5-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 17-year-olds.

15

If it's 5-year-olds, then it's vastly over-restrictive;

16

if it's 17-year-olds, I suspect -- I suspect it wouldn't

17

restrict anything because nobody is going to be able to

18

convince a -- jury, well, this is an 18-year-old game,

19

not a 17-year-old game.

20

21

line of course in the death penalty area, don't we?

would correspond to, and I don't think you can cut it

7

that finely and say, well, this is an 18 game; this is

8

only a 17 game.

9

that's the test, the test Justice Breyer suggested it

I just don't think that works.

So if

10

ought to be, then the statute essentially would restrict

11

nothing.

Well, first of all -
And as you experimented

18

with other things, as they did in the obscenity area,

19

you could discover you could limit it to that.

20

MR. SMITH:

I think the "maybe" is telling,

21

though, Your Honor.

Somebody, as Justice Scalia pointed

22

out, in publishing a game has to know what -- what to -

23

what the rules of the game are in advance, subject to

24

hundreds of millions of dollars of penalties.

rules?

5

prosecuted for a different one.

Your rules.

The X things would be limited to

MR. SMITH:

And you might never.

Our rules wouldn't help you at

all.

They say that -- that -- they're only restricting

8

a smaller number, a small subset of M-rated games,

9

which, by the way, we say are appropriate for

10

17-year-olds.

So you have -- these ratings that the

11

State wants us to impose are going to conflict with the

12

ratings that are already on the packaging which are

13

being used by parents every day to make these judgments.

14

So it's actually interfering -- the prospect of it would

interfere with the information already on the packaging.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MORAZZINI:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice.
I wanted to address one point that has been
raised about minors' ability to access these games.

Yes, new games do cost $60, but California's law also

them and can access them.

5

So minors certainly can afford

But I also wanted to draw out the point that

6

California's law really is not an ordinance that's

7

directed to a plot of a game.

8

to games with essentially no plot, no artistic value.

9

This is the helpful nature of the third prong of the

11

nature of the game where the child is acting out -

12

So it really is only going after the

14

test for artistic value?

MR. MORAZZINI:

So long as

No, if the -- if the level

7

of the violence -- just as in obscenity, if the level of

8

the violence causes the game as a whole to lack the

artistic -- it's -- it's a balance, Your Honor, just as

10

Justice Kagan, by

don't know off the top of my head.

12

right here in open court that the video game Postal 2,

I'm willing to state

I'm willing to guess

I think the video game

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would a video game that

18

portrayed a Vulcan, as opposed to a human being, being

19

maimed and tortured -- would that be covered by the Act?

20

MR. MORAZZINI:

No, it wouldn't, Your Honor,

21

because the Act is only directed towards the range of

22

options that are able to be inflicted on a human being.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if the -- if the

24

video producer says this is not a human being, it's an

reasons that sex and violence are so similar.

Just temporarily.

Is that covered by your Act?
