MR. KROGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Pearson v. Callahan, this Court gave the

lower Federal courts discretionary power to decide

13

substantive questions of constitutional law in qualified

14

immunity cases in order to further the development of

that this Court be able to review those decisions in

He is a child protective

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What I was about to ask is

this:

a -- a determination on the merits, it should be

16

reviewable, but could still disagree that it's

17

reviewable where the requirements for Article III are

18

not met; that is, where there is really no justiciable

19

controversy between the parties.

I can agree with you that -- that where there is

What -- what is the interest of the -- of
the parties who were victorious here?
MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, the interest of Mr.

23

Camreta is the ongoing harm he has in his job.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

Why would he face

4

liability?

Because he didn't have the opportunity to

5

challenge that decision, the Fourth Amendment decision;

6

therefore, it would have no preclusive effect on him.

7

party who doesn't have the -- if there are alternative

8

holdings and you lose on one, win on the other, you're

9

not precluded by the loss because you didn't have an

10

opportunity to raise it on appeal.

11

12

you're suggesting?

13

A

So why would Camreta

Why would he face punitive damages as

MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit

14

15

specifically advised Mr. Camreta and others in his

16

position that they are on notice that in-school

17

interviews of students that require a seizure require a

18

warrant, and, thus, the Ninth Circuit decision does have

19

precedential effect and impacts Mr. Camreta.

It's impossible that she will be confronted with

Your Honor, I disagree that

S.G. has no ongoing concrete stake in the outcome of

9

this case.

In footnote 20 of the Respondent's brief on

10

page 33, the Respondent notes that they have filed a

11

motion in the United States district court to bring

12

their Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County, a

13

potential party that has no qualified immunity as a

14

defense.

15

that claim against Deschutes County will depend very

16

much on the ruling on the merits of this Court.

17

And, obviously, the legal viability of that -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is a Monell claim,

21

MR. KROGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

22

The district court ruled that it was premature until

these proceedings were concluded.

answer, then, that that's the right case to take up?

Because in this case, we have a plaintiff who is not

Your Honor, the controversy

16

remains the Fourth Amendment claim, which is the

Camreta does his job doesn't -- that claim doesn't

So, again, why isn't this the

interests of the county, not -- not the interests of the

MR. KROGER:

13

Your Honor, in Arizonans v.

14

Arizona, the Court recognized that the employee in that

15

case had an interest in how she was able to conduct her

16

job.

17

because she had resigned from her position with the

State.

19

because she was a public employee that wanted to perform

20

her job in a particular way because she was required to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

She was the plaintiff.

In Arizona, we were talking about whether a plaintiff

still had a viable claim, right?

MR. KROGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General Kroger, I don't

2

think that the question here is really a standing

3

question; it's really whether there is a controversy

4

between this particular plaintiff and this particular

5

defendant such that a judgment in this case would

6

actually affect the legal relationship between the two,

7

between the particular plaintiff and the particular

8

defendant.
So how would it do that?

9

How would a legal

10

judgment in this case affect the legal relationship

11

between this plaintiff and this defendant?
MR. KROGER:

12

Your Honor, the -- the -- Mr.

13

Camreta remains a party below, and it's possible that

14

the Court's rulings on the Fourth Amendment merits may

15

impact the Fourteenth Amendment claims that are being

16

made against Mr. Camreta that are alive and in

17

controversy below.
Moreover, this case, even if one strips out

18
19

the ongoing motion that's been made in the district

20

court, resembles in all material respects Erie v.

21

Pap's A.M., where the Court found that there was

22

standing to bring the case and it was not moot.

23

there does seem to be an active case or controversy that

is equivalent to that that was present in Erie v.

That would make you happy,

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- the --

I think the only difficulty with that as a -- as a

outcome of the case is it undercuts the logic of the

that.

the child abuse context is somewhat unique in that there

are very few ways to investigate properly child abuse

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A number of the questions this morning have

focused on the question whether a live case or

18

controversy remains because Respondent has chosen not to

19

challenge the Ninth Circuit's qualified immunity ruling

20

and so purportedly has no continuing stake in the

resolution of this controversy.

not correct for the reasons General Kroger has given,

but it's also not an irreducible minimum of this Court's

jurisdiction to correct the mistake that the Ninth

Circuit made in this case.

viable claim now?

4

evasive of review?

This is not capable of repetition,

MS. KRUGER:

5

Does she have any

Well, two responses, Justice

6

Ginsburg.

First, as General Kroger mentioned, she has a

7

continuing interest in how this Court resolves this

8

controversy because of her attempt to bring the same

9

Fourth Amendment claim against Deschutes County.

10

setting that aside, this Court hasn't universally

11

required that as a prerequisite to exercising its

12

jurisdiction.

13

to illustrate the point.

But

I think there are two examples that help

The first is the City of Erie v. Pap's A.M.

14
15

case, in which this Court decided to review a State

16

court injunction entered in favor of a plaintiff who no

17

longer had what we would think of as an Article III

18

stake in the case by the time the case reached this

19

Court.

20

The plaintiff in that case had left the nude

21

dancing business and had affirmatively stated they had

22

no intention to return.

23

reached the merits of the State court decision that was

24

on review because to do otherwise would be to saddle the

City of Erie with an ongoing injury.

undermine the very purposes for which this Court -­

And I think, as you quite properly

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Kruger, how does this -­

17

this situation, the qualified immunity situation, differ

18

from a wide variety of other situations in which we

19

might not be able to get to the underlying

20

constitutional ruling?

21

For example, in any case where there's a

22

constitutional ruling but also a harmless error ruling,

23

or in a Sixth Amendment case where there are standards

24

about ineffective assistance of counsel but then a

25

finding that there's no prejudice.
19
Alderson Reporting Company

In all of those

Official - Subject to Final Review

kinds of cases, the underlying substantive ruling might

2

be insulated from our review.

3

the qualified immunity situation is different and how

4

would you be able to cabin this rule?
MS. KRUGER:

5

How would you say that

The reason we think the

6

qualified immunity situation is different, it presents a

7

set of exceptional circumstances that weren't an

8

exception to the usual prudential rule, is because the

9

qualified immunity situation is one in which this Court

10

has encouraged courts to undertake these kinds of

11

constitutional rulings for the purpose of changing the

12

legal landscape going forward, for the very purpose of

13

establishing the law so that the -- that qualified

14

immunity doesn't remain perpetually available to

officials even though they are engaging in conduct -­

Presumably, in

every case in which a court does these paired rulings,

harmless, but says that there was an error -- there's a

purpose to clarify the law.

the next case.

Camreta and other child protective services workers who

10

are doing their best to protect children from abuse are

11

now on notice that if they attempt to detain temporarily

12

a child in school for the purposes of trying to confirm

13

or dispel a reasonable suspicion of child abuse without

14

a warrant supported by probable cause, that they will

invite lawsuits that would put them on the line for

That's true, Justice Scalia,

and I think that if that's the disposition that this

Court thinks is appropriate, we would be certainly be

24

happier with that than a rule that says -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

It would be -­

MS. KRUGER:

-- an incorrect constitutional

ruling.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

It would be a

4

partial vacatur, right?

5

hasn't it, where we vacate part of a decision under

6

Munsingwear?
MS. KRUGER:

7

The Court's done that before,

That's correct, Mr. Chief

8

Justice.

But I would note that a vacatur rule would

9

come with certain costs that I think this Court should

10

keep in mind as it decides what the appropriate

11

disposition of this case is.

12

The reason that Respondent has so vigorously

13

objected to that disposition is because it is

14

inconsistent in some ways with the very reason for

15

permitting courts of appeals to undertake this kind of

16

constitutional determination in the first place.

17

undermines the -- the development of the constitutional

18

law if this Court simply wipes the -- the slate clean

19

but doesn't exercise its own authority to clarify the

20

law by correcting what the Ninth Circuit has done.

21

I think, as the Chief Justice has quite correctly

22

pointed out, it also does nothing to dispel the cloud of

23

uncertainty that hangs over individuals within the

24

territorial jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit.

2

(Laughter.)

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If it's vacated, it

4

indicates that there's no established law on that

5

question, and it seems to me Camreta would be free to do

6

what he considered appropriate under the circumstances,

7

and if somebody tries to impose personal liability on

8

him, it seems he has an even stronger case than he might

9

have before.

10

MS. KRUGER:

I think that's correct, Mr.

11

Chief Justice, and I think for that reason we would not

12

object to that disposition in this case.

13

observe that that disposition is one that does not sit

14

particularly comfortably with the reasoning of Pearson

15

and the line of cases that comes before it, that

16

recognizes that the reason why we encourage courts of

17

appeals to undertake these determinations in the first

18

place is to promote the development of constitutional

19

law and to ensure that the law doesn't remain not

20

clearly established in perpetuity.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We would just

It seems to me it would

affect Camreta's behavior and that of other child

23

protective officers.

Constitution, and it would seem to me that any

take that seriously into account.

MS. KRUGER:

right, Justice Kennedy.

I think that's absolutely

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't the test clearly established law?
MS. KRUGER:

What's the test?

That's right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Why?

Would this be clearly

11

established law under any -- any conceivable

12

interpretation of that?

13

MS. KRUGER:

I think it's -- it's true that

14

if this Court were to vacate the Ninth Circuit's

15

constitutional ruling, Mr. Camreta and others who are

16

similarly situated wouldn't face the very significant

17

concrete prospective effect of this decision, which is

18

to strip them of qualified immunity in future cases.

19

They would be able to argue, as you're suggesting, that

20

the law is not clearly established.

MS. KRUGER:

The Ninth Circuit in this case held that the temporary

detention of a child in school to confirm or dispel

suspicions that that child is being abused is

5

unconstitutional unless the questioning officials have a

warrant, probable cause, or parental consent.

This was not a class action lawsuit, and the court was

What does the Fourth Amendment require?

Okay.

straightforward question whether an in-school seizure

of -- of this case, we would ask this Court to uphold a

investigators is presumptively unconstitutional unless

10

they have a warrant or court order or parental consent

11

or exigent circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO:

12

What is there in the Ninth

13

Circuit's opinion, which -- which generally requires a

14

warrant, to suggest that the length of the interrogation

15

was relevant to their decision?

16

child protective services need to decide whether they

need a warrant before they begin the questioning, no

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the information

her father, then there is a likelihood that there will

be police interest in that.

MS. KUBITSCHEK:

Well, and this -- this

Court recognized also that possibility in Ferguson v.

The City of Charleston, that the -- the nurses at the

No, it would not be the

same if it was the school nurse or Mr. Camreta.

And

the -- the reason is that the school nurse is part of

the school administration, and the school has an

If Mr. Camreta came in from

MS. KUBITSCHEK:

I'm aware of that.

But,

was conceded that there was a seizure so early in the -­

10

in the case that the normal development of facts which,

as Justice Scalia, you have pointed out, whether or not

there is a seizure is certainly dependent on the

that some kind of approval by a detached individual

have probable cause that there's abuse before they can

question the child to find whether or not there was

abuse, or would you set it at some lower level?
MS. KUBITSCHEK:

Well, in fact, Your Honor,

3

the -- most of the States have a procedure for seeking

4

court approval, and their -- they differ in whether they

5

require probable cause or reasonable suspicion or

6

something like reasonable cause; and so while we put in

7

our brief that the seizure of S.G. should have been

8

based upon probable cause, given the law enforcement

9

component, if there was -- if Alford, the deputy

10

sheriff, were not there at all, and it was purely a

11

child welfare seizure and the child welfare caseworker

12

were going to a juvenile court judge and seeking some

13

kind of judicial approval, the -- because the laws of

14

the States differ between reasonable suspicion and

15

probable cause, I would suggest that the better course

would be to let this play itself out between those two

perpetually subject to -- to qualified immunity because

12

the law would not be clarified.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

And that -­
Would you -- are you -­

14

and I guess what I'm asking is, let's assume we go ex

15

ante.

16

they can move from a nonseizure to a seizure, correct?

17

And some seizures can be reasonable and some can't,

18

right?

At any moment that an agency speaks to a child,

19

MR. KROGER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And law enforcement is

21

never going to know where that line of reasonableness or

22

unreasonableness is, is that correct?

23

MR. KROGER:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

That's correct.
That's in -- that's in

the nature of doing this without a warrant, isn't it?

MR. KROGER:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's part

2

of the reason we agreed that a seizure was committed

3

here, so that law enforcement are not placed in a

4

difficult position every time they speak to a child, of

5

trying to make their own determination as to whether -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

But they do it anyway,

7

meaning even if we say that they can seize the child,

8

you would still have to not do a seizure that was

9

unreasonable.

10

You wouldn't -- in scope.

They can't

speak to the child endlessly, can they?
MR. KROGER:

11

No, Your Honor, that's correct.

12

The government officials will have to conduct that -­

13

that seizure in a reasonable manner for a reasonable

14

duration.

15

Honor, than the threshold question of if they start to

16

talk to a child, of trying to judge in the middle of an

17

interview, have we gone too far, has a seizure occurred.

18

That's different, I think, though, Your

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not quite sure why

19

you stipulated to a seizure in this case, but that was

20

your strategic choice.

21

MR. KROGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, the question

22

is whether vacating the decision will have an impact on

23

the litigation below, and it will.

24

seeking to preserve the Ninth Circuit decision precisely

25

to aid the Fourth Amendment claim that the Respondent is

The Respondent is

making against Deschutes County, and thus, this is

2

somewhat analogous to the situation in the Pacific Bell

3

case, where you have a Petitioner and Respondent seeking

4

different remedies from this Court in light of the

5

impact that it will have on subsequent litigation.

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. KROGER:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Ms. Kubitschek said it was
Is that right or not?

The due process -­
The Fourth Amendment claim

against the county is based on -- on this interview?
MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, I have not seen the

12

new complaint, but my understanding is that it is the

13

same event and same claim.
