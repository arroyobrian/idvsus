We’ll hear argument

5

Company v. the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

6

Mr. Mathiason.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARRY G. MATHIASON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MATHIASON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

This case involves two questions.

Taking

12

them in the order that the Ninth Circuit addressed

13

them, we look first at whether the complaint contained

14

sufficient facts to support a cause of action against

15

a non-signatory international union that engages in a

16

company-wide strike that violates the no-strike clause

17

of a contract between the local and the employer.

18

This is not a strike for higher wages,

19

better benefits; it's a strike for an amendment to the

20

contract that would provide immunity for the

21

international and other locals with regard to past

22

wrongdoing.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23
24
25

The -It's a tort action,

right?
MR. MATHIASON:

It is a tort action by being

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

contract is an evidentiary matter that you have to

7

establish, but the cause of action is still tort, and

8

of course 301(a) is limited to violations of

9

contracts.

10

I suppose the existence of a

MR. MATHIASON:

Your Honor, 301(a) provides

11

jurisdiction if there's a suit for a breach -- if

12

there's a suit for violation of a contract, and that

13

can be between a nonparty and a party, and then the

14

contract is between the union and the employer.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't see how

16

somebody who is not a party to the contract can

17

violate the contract.

18

sorts of things, but I don't see that they can be

19

liable for violating the contract.

interference with -- what is it, the ability to enter

12

into a contract, I think, is recognized in some

13

jurisdictions.

14
15
16

MR. MATHIASON:

That's -- that's cognizable.

That's certainly not here.
What we’re doing is looking at a very minor

17

adjustment in what would otherwise be a

18

straightforward contract action; and that is that you

19

have a situation where the international displaced the

20

local after the contract was entered into, took

21

control, and that control we manifested in several

22

specific points within our complaint.

23

-- it's effectively an agency relationship between the

24

-- at that point between the international and the

25

local, but it's an agency relationship to control them
5

And another way

to effect the breach.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, then you could have

sued on an agency claim, couldn't you?

4

MR. MATHIASON:

We did originally look at an

5

agency claim.

6

agency claim, at the time the contract was formed,

7

it's clear the local was not operating on behalf of

8

the international.

9

The problem with that is that under an

It was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but I mean -- if

10

you’re coming up and saying, well, we have a

11

principal-agent here, I could understand that, but

12

that's I didn't think the question we are here to

13

decide.

14

MR. MATHIASON:

15

whether there’s a cause of action.

16

The question to decide is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

On -- on the tortious

17

interference as to whether or not that's under 301.

18

Sure, agent-principal, I understand that.

19

Thereafter, what happened is you have the

did address the pre-emption doctrine and indicated

that it would extend to torts.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Allis-Chalmers involved the

That's correct, Your Honor.

MR. MATHIASON:

Your Honor, we have taken

the strong position that it is pre-empted by 301.

application of the contract.

the contractual issue?

you let the 301 case go forward?

15

What is the issue of

MR. MATHIASON:

The issue would be whether

16

the action of engaging in the strike violates the no­

17

strike clause of the collective bargaining agreement.

18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is there any dispute about

that?

20

MR. MATHIASON:

I think there is a dispute

about that. I think there’s a dispute about the

underlying existence of the contract, and then the --

the no-strike clause is complex.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Am I correct that neither

you, neither Granite Rock nor the local, thinks that

5

the December collective bargaining agreement really

6

was fully retroactive?

They don't think it was --

7

MR. MATHIASON:

That's correct.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- it meant that the no­

9

strike clause was in effect on the day when the old

10

collective bargaining agreement expired, and you don't

11

think that the new arbitration clause was in effect on

12

the day when the old collective bargaining agreement

13

expired, or do I not understand your positions?

14

MR. MATHIASON:

Justice Alito, that’s

15

exactly right.

16

mean, there is a crystal-clear understanding between

17

the parties that the time of ratification is the time

18

that the no-strike clause came into effect, and if

19

there was no ratification on July 2nd, we wouldn't

20

have signed the contract with the wage levels that are

21

described in December. When we signed it, we signed it

22

with the assumption that it was the contract that was

23

formed on July 2nd.

24
25

We agree with that.

It wasn't.

And the issue of formation was never given

whether -- since we disagree about it, that would go

A year later, we enter into another

to arbitrate every dispute between us, including that

old dispute about whether there was that old contract,

MR. MATHIASON:

Your Honor, if that had

2

been, let's say, 4 years later, and we entered into a

3

new contract willingly and getting the exchange, the

4

no-strike clause for the arbitration, and that new

5

contract said, this is going to deal with all past

6

disputes, including prior contracts, fine.

7

When we executed that contract in December,

8

we executed the contract that we believed was formed

9

in July.

There is no meeting of the minds.

In other

10

words, the union's execution was on a contract they

11

say was formed on the 22nd.

12

There is a major, major issue here, and that

13

is on July 2nd we made the concessions on wages,

14

working conditions, and the rest of it, with the

15

explicit understanding that it would be ratified at

16

that time.

17

the joint appendix 377, has that qualification in it.

18

Stipulated fact number 16, I think it's in

If it wasn't ratified on July 2nd, then what

19

happened is it was withdrawn, it exploded, there was

20

nothing, there was nothing to be signed in December.

21

We only signed what was agreed to on July 2nd and

22

maintained that position because we believe we got the

23

benefit and the protection of a no-strike clause all

24

the way through that time period.

25

And so that is the critical distinction.

And now I couldn't agree more with this Court that

2

it's an academic exercise to go to either an

3

arbitrator or a court on whether it is in effect as of

4

July 2nd.

5

in that regard.

6

We believe the NLRB decision is preclusive

But there is underneath it, there has to be

7

a forum.

There has to be somebody to say that.

If an

8

arbitrator got the case, looked at it, said, well, I'm

9

not sure I really agree with the NLRB, and I think I'm

10

going to decide it differently, and that then went to

11

review in a court, and the arbitrator made a mistake

12

of law, a mistake of fact, it's not completely clear

13

to me that we would be able to come back to this Court

14

and get it effectively changed.

We are saying that the issue of formation

But then the parties

The Court should ask itself that -- when the
union and its members are engaging in lawful,

10

protected, concerted activity, a strike, on July 1,

11

did they intend to convert that lawful economic

12

activity into a breach of contract?

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

And you say no, but what do

14

you say about the -- but you say that the arbitration

clause was intended to be retroactive.

MR. BONSALL:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Excuse me, Your Honor.
But you say that the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the

union's initial position was that there was no

agreement, and it refused to arbitrate.

11

what -- wasn't the union's refusal to arbitrate what

12

precipitated this case?

13
14
15

MR. BONSALL:

Isn't that

That is not correct, Your

Honor.
On July 26th of 2004, the union was

16

confronting a Boys Markets injunction that was being

17

sought by the employer.

18

court was whether the union should be enjoined, its

19

strike should be enjoined.

20

took the clear position that there was not a contract

21

in place at that time on July 26th, but even if there

22

was, the injunction should not issue because of this

23

Court's decision in Buffalo Forge.

25

The issue before the trial

The matter that was continuing to be an

bargaining agreement because it involved other labor

2

organizations and essentially a back-to-work

3

agreement.

4

position that there was no contract, but the reason

5

why an injunction was not appropriate was because of

6

Buffalo Forge.

So on July 26th, the union did take the

I thought that at that

time the union refused to arbitrate.

10

MR. BONSALL:

No.

There was no question

11

about arbitrating anything.

12

to have arbitration at all at the July 26th hearing.

13

The only question at that point in time was whether

14

there was ratification or not.

15

that the union's representative had made a

16

communication to the employer's representative that

17

the contract had been ratified.

The employer didn't ask

But, at least now that we

1

have had the NLRB's -- the NLRB has weighed in and

2

said that there was a contract as of July 2nd, why

3

isn't that conclusive?

4

MR. BONSALL:

We think that there's still an

5

issue that is being sent to the arbitrator, the breach

6

of contract and damages, but as a precursor to that,

7

we contend that the issue never should have been

8

litigated at all by the trial court about whether

9

there was formation, because there was no question of

10

formation at that time.

11

contract ratification, and that issue falls within the

12

scope of the broad arbitration provision under the

13

collective bargaining agreement.

14

It was only a question of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When we go back --

I thought you answered

15

Justice Alito "no," but I thought his question was a

very simple one.

The dispute between the

means and which provisions are in effect or not.

contract formation; this is a question of -- of the

the no-strike clause was not in effect, but we do take

The arbitrator -- since

you agree that there’s a contract in effect -32

MR. BONSALL:

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- the arbitrator is

3

not going to decide whether the contract is there or

4

not.

5

MR. BONSALL:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

He will not.
And the contract has

a no-strike clause.

8

MR. BONSALL:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So you expect the

10

arbitrator to say you get the benefit of the contract

11

that lets me decide something, and even though there’s

12

a no-strike clause in the contract, you want the

13

arbitrator to say that no-strike clause is not

14

operative on July 2nd?

15

MR. BONSALL:

We expect the arbitrator to

16

take a look at the facts that existed on July 2nd and

17

make a determination whether in fact at that point in

answer is, one, that there is no contract, right?

their remedy is to seek that breach of contract and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. NUSSBAUM
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS
MR. NUSSBAUM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
There are three basic points that I would

22

like to discuss with the Court this morning with

23

regard to the section 301 issue.

24
25

The first is that, in our view, the issue as
to whether or not a tort claim can be brought under
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

301 begins and ends with the clear language of section

2

301, which talks about suits for violation of

3

contract.

4

The second point I’d like to make is that

5

allowing the tort action, as Granite Rock is urging,

6

would work a big change in the structure that Congress

7

has established by which it has decided that major

8

issues of labor law, such as the weapons -- economic

9

weapons that parties can use, should be decided by

10

Congress through statute and by the National Labor

11

Relations Board through the application of the

12

statute.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you take the position

14

that the cause of action for interference with a

15

contract has been pre-empted insofar as State law is

16

concerned?

17

21

MR. NUSSBAUM:

That's, of course, not an

issue in this case because it was never attempted -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What is your position on

that point?
MR. NUSSBAUM:

The law in most of the

22

circuits is that any case which involves the

23

interpretation of a contract is pre-empted.

3

actions for interference with -- with contract

4

relations?

5

MR. NUSSBAUM:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

So then you

7

are submitting to this Court that the purpose of the

8

National Relation -- Labor Relations Act and its

9

effect was to give immunity to unions for intentional

10

interference with contractual relations?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

effect of your argument here?

15

MR. NUSSBAUM:

emption of State torts is not dependent on section

301.

19

have been pre-empted prior, under Garmon or Machinists

20

21

would interfere with conduct that is arguably

23

area unregulated by Congress.

It is in your view, you -- you said, well,

there’s relief against the local, but there’s no

19

occurred if it hadn't been for the pressure from the

20

international.

MR. NUSSBAUM:

No, I disagree.

There is an

avenue that Granite Rock could have pursued but did

not pursue, and that was to have filed a charge

The question is whether 301 allows that type

11

12

think the language of the statute, violation of

I thought that did the basic pre-emptive

job.

And then where it is pre-empted by the LMRA, 301

6

creates an exception to the pre-emption, so that it

7

isn't pre-empted, if you have a suit.

thinking is probably out-of-date and wrong, so I would

MR. NUSSBAUM:

Now, my

I -- I think perhaps we are

saying the same thing --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, because I think

13

that your response to the Chief Justice's question,

14

which is why I became uncertain, is that it is the

15

LMRA -- not the LMRA at all that pre-empts tort

16

actions and State activities that interfere with labor

17

relations, as this might.

18

itself that pre-empts it, and then it is odd because

19

it pre-empts it, but it says, we won't give you any,

It is, rather, section 301

removal purposes, which I know there’s some debate

15

about, when courts look at State law torts, they tend

MR. NUSSBAUM:

It would have to be a proof

of damages that resulted from the unfair labor

10

practice, from the unfair conduct, which, in this

11

situation, would have been the interference into the

12

bargaining process.

13

what the damages would be, for the international as

opposed to the local union, I'm really not sure, but

there is certainly the capacity under the NLRA for

there to be a make-whole remedy.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you -- while saying that

MR. NUSSBAUM:

Why does

Congress did in 301 was to create limited jurisdiction

23

MR. NUSSBAUM:

the purpose that this is an issue that should be

decided by the regulatory agency, which Congress

doing it, rather than having courts get involved in

15

is a no-man's zone that Congress should go to and

16

regulate, but if you back up to 1947 and the passage

17
