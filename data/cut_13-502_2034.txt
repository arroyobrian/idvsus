 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument first this morning in Case 13502, Reed v. Town 

5

of Gilbert. 

6

 Mr. Cortman.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID CORTMAN 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9
10

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11

 The town's code discriminates on its face by 

12

treating certain signs differently based solely on what 

13

they say.  For example, political signs may be 32 square 

14

feet, may be unlimited in number, and may be placed in 

15

the rightofway of the entire town for five months 

16

before the election; but the church's signs can only be 

17

onefifth of that side  size, only placed in the dark 

18

of night, the night before the church service. 

19

 While the church's signs with directional 

20

content are only allowed up for 14 hours, other signs 

21

with directional content are allowed up for much longer. 

22

For example, builders' directional signs to home sales 

23

events are allowed up to be the entire  are allowed up 

24

the entire weekend, and homeowners' association event 

25

signs are allowed to be up for 30 days.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, what are  what 

2

are you seeking?  Do you  do you want whatever is the 

3

most favorable rule, say, for ideological signs?  Is 

4

that what you want?  Or do you accept that it could be 

5

some limit on event signs, say, some reasonable time 

6

limit? 

7

 MR. CORTMAN: 

We're  we're seeking the 

8

same as the  the favorable signs, which, in this case, 

9

would be both ideological and political signs. 

10

 And  and the reason on that 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

12
13

But the ideological isn't 

time unlimited. 
 MR. CORTMAN: 

Well, but it's not allowed on 

14

the rightofway, and so that's a major factor in this 

15

case because political signs are allowed on the 

16

rightofway, and so the treatment that we're seeking is 

17

merely equal treatment under the First Amendment. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The same treatment as 

political signs, then, is that 
 MR. CORTMAN: 

The  the same treatment as 

21

political signs that are allowed up in the rightofway, 

22

that's right. 

23

 And ideological signs, interestingly enough, 

24

are still based into their own content category, but 

25

they are not allowed on the rightofway, yet they are

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

allowed up for an unlimited period of time. 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3

seeking unlimited placement? 

4

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Are you  are you 

We are not.  We're seeking 

5

placement that any other temporary signs get, which is 

6

the category that we're talking about. 

7

 And, in fact, the  the city, the town here 

8

has freedom to regulate the amount of time signs can go 

9

up, the size of the signs, the number of the signs.  All 

10

our argument is, is that they do it across the board and 

11

not treat signs differently based on their content. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Your  your 

13

argument does not turn on the fact that it's a church's 

14

sign, does it?  I mean, you  your argument would be 

15

the same if this is a temporary sign about where the 

16

soccer game was going to be? 

17

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Well, that's right.  And 

18

and the church's sign merely adds additional components 

19

to it.  For example, the town puts our  the church's 

20

sign into a category called directional signs; but, yet, 

21

the church's sign has religious speech on it.  It has, 

22

obviously, directional speech.  It has ideological 

23

speech.  But that's correct, it's  it's equal 

24

treatment for that type of sign. 

25

 And  and the category 

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I ask about the category 

2

for political signs, which is the most favorable? 

3

Because all the time this Court says that political 

4

speech is the most valued kind of speech.  It's at the 

5

heart of the First Amendment.  It gets special First 

6

Amendment protection.  So in a way, why aren't 

7

isn't  isn't the locality here basically adopting the 

8

same kind of categorybased understanding of political 

9

speech and its special rule and First Amendment analysis 

10
11

that this Court has very frequently articulated? 
 MR. CORTMAN: 

But I think this Court has 

12

also said, for example, that  that religious speech 

13

also handles that category of core speech under the 

14

First Amendment.  And the problem is, is what the 

15

what the town does here, it's valuing speech, and I 

16

think that is one of the problems.  It is saying that 

17

political speech in this case is more valuable than an 

18

invitation to church. 

19
20
21
22
23

 And so I think this Court has made clear 
that  that the government 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I  I'm sorry. 

That was the significance of my prior question. 
 What  what they're really saying is that 

24

political speech is more valuable than speech about 

25

where the soccer game is.  In other words, I thought you

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

indicated that your argument did not depend on the fact 

2

that the sign was a sign for the church. 

3

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Well, that's right.  It 

4

doesn't depend on that fact.  I was merely referring to 

5

the facts of this case.  I apologize 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Don't you think that 

7

political speech is more valuable than directions to the 

8

soccer game? 

9

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Maybe in some people's eyes, 

10

but the problem we have is  is should the government 

11

be deciding what speech is more valuable than others, 

12

because that is exactly what it did in this case.  It 

13

has said that, in fact, your speech is not valuable and 

14

we can completely ban it.  And I think one of the 

15

problems 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, let's  let's 

17

take a sign that in all other ways is equal except that 

18

it says no signs on residential property except 

19

properties that are being sold.  And so it's valued the 

20

homeowner's right to sell its property.  Would that be 

21

contrary of  the First Amendment, and if not, why is that 

22

value any different than valuing political speech? 

23

 MR. CORTMAN: 

I think it would be.  I think 

24

this Court's case Linmark dealt with a similar 

25

circumstance, where in that city, it banned all

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

residential signs except for  in fact, it was the 

2

reverse.  It banned for sale signs and allowed some 

3

residential signs that were exceptions. 

4

 But this Court said exactly that, that the 

5

town shouldn't value different types of speech, 

6

especially on private property when you have homeowners' 

7

rights that also comes into play in addition to speech 

8

rights. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if it's commercial and 

10

it relates to a onetime event.  For example, for a yard 

11

sale. 

12

 MR. CORTMAN: 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Right. 
If the State and the city 

14

allow electionrelated signs to be put up in the 

15

rightofway, then anybody who has a yard sale has an 

16

equal right? 

17

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Well, I think  I think 

18

commercial speech, under this Court's jurisprudence, can 

19

be treated differently, and that's one of the important 

20

things.  The category here is narrow because government 

21

speech  government can put up whatever signs that it 

22

would like.  It doesn't trigger any problem under the 

23

First Amendment. 

24
25

 We hear a lot in the other briefs about 
warning signs and other types of signs.  The government

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is free to put up all the signs that it would like 

2

without triggering this problem.  Commercial speech is 

3

also in a different category, according to this Court. 

4

 So the narrow category that we're talking 

5

about is temporary signs, not permanent signs, that are 

6

put up in the rightofway that can be regulated. 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

8

signs is a valid category? 

9

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Do you think directional 

The reason I don't think it is 

10

is because here, the direction is part of the invitation 

11

to come and worship or part of the invitation to come to 

12

a different event.  So the directional part of it is in 

13

addition to the ideological speech, the invitation to 

14

come in and worship.  And so although it appears to be a 

15

different category of directional, it's important to the 

16

speech of the church, inviting the community and saying 

17

come worship with us, and here is where we are located. 

18

 And what's interesting about that, if the 

19

church, for example, says we're meeting now at a senior 

20

living center, that is considered to be a directional 

21

sign because the definition is a sign that is intended 

22

to invite and direct someone to your service, that would 

23

then be banned in the rightofway. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I guess you see the 

concern, if an affluent person wants to celebrate a

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

birthday, he can put "Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" as 

2

many places as a political sign, and as for long. 

3

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Well, I think one of the 

4

issues is if the government has decided that its 

5

interest  which, by the way, is what drives this, the 

6

interest in safety and aesthetics, which is the two 

7

interests the government proposes.  If those have 

8

already been deemed to be less important than speech, 

9

then I think speech should be allowed.  But 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: But your answer to the 

11

question is "Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" can have as 

12

many signs and for as long as the political campaign. 

13
14
15

 MR. CORTMAN: 

I think  I think that is 

right.  And I 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That has  that has to 

16

be  seem to me  what about historical marker, the 

17

birthplace of James Madison or whatever? 

18

 MR. CORTMAN: 

I think the answer to that is 

19

the government is free to put up that marker without 

20

any 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, no, it's privately 

privately owned. 
 MR. CORTMAN: 

Well, I think if it's  if 

24

it's allowing private speech, then we engage in the 

25

problem of valuing.  For example, in that case, we think

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that marker is more important than someone else's 


2


speech. 


3


 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So again, under your view, 

4

"Happy birthday, Uncle Fred" and "Save your soul" and 


5


"Birthplace of James Madison" can all be up for the same 

6

length of time, same size. 

7

 MR. CORTMAN: 

I think it can, because 

8

otherwise I think we have a problem with contentbased 

9

discrimination 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about permanent signs? 

11

I assume that what you say about temporary signs would 

12

apply equally to permanent signs, wouldn't it? 

13

 MR. CORTMAN: 

It would, but in a different 

14

category.  In other words, our category that we're 

15

discussing is temporary signs, so ours wouldn't affect 

16

permanent signs.  I believe you could make  that's a 

17

contentneutral category. 

18

 But if you had a permanent sign, I think 

19

within the permanent sign category, the answer is 

20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
category 

22

MR. CORTMAN: 

23

JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24
25

Within the permanent sign 


Yes. 

 they all have to have 


the same 
MR. CORTMAN: 

I believe so, because 


11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 except commercial, I 

assume. 
 MR. CORTMAN: 

And especially if  most of 

4

the permanent signs are commercial signs.  When we talk 

5

about billboards and other types of signs, so this Court 

6

I think has made clear if you have, for example, 

7

billboards and other permanent signs that do allow 

8

commercial speech, then the municipality must allow 

9

noncommercial speech. 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, you 

characterize 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what would happen if 

13

one church has a  always meets in the same place and 

14

it wants to put up a sign that says, every Sunday this 

15

is the place to go, and another church moves around, so 

16

it wants to put up a temporary sign.  Do they have to be 

17

treated the same? 

18

 MR. CORTMAN: 

I think they would.  If we're 

19

talking about the category of what goes on public 

20

property, what goes on the rightofway.  On their own 

21

property is a different question.  But here, the town 

22

has already decided to allow an unlimited number of 

23

political signs up to 30 square  32 square feet for 

24

nearly the entire year.  There are four elections in 

25

Arizona, so with this time limit of five months, you

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have political signs in an unlimited number.  And those 

2

signs affect the safety and aesthetics interest the same 

3

way as the church's sign does, the same way as an 

4

invitation 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How do you create your 

6

temporary category without reading the sign?  And 

7

so there is some force, the counterargument that what is 

8

being regulated here is not the content but the function 

9

of the sign.  So how do you get around that argument? 

10

Because you've already created a category that requires 

11

you to read the sign. 

12

 MR. CORTMAN: 

I don't think it does, and the 

13

reason the way the temporary sign is defined here is 

14

merely a sign that's both  intended and constructed not 

15

to be permanent.  So it doesn't matter what is on that 

16

sign; that's why we think that category is content 

17

neutral, because as long as it's a temporary sign, it 

18

doesn't matter what the sign says.  A permanent sign is 

19

just duration, and there can be duration requirements, 

20

there can be size requirements, location requirements. 

21

That the government 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So your point is if 

23

it's  if it's stuck in the ground with a little 

24

stake 

25

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Right.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 then it can be 

treated one way, but if it's in concrete  but 

3

 MR. CORTMAN: 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's right. 
It seems to me that 

5

you are trying to find a, I don't know, a difficult way 

6

to deal with an issue that could be readily addressed 

7

just by seeing if the sign is for a limited event.  In 

8

other words, what if somebody  every time  you know, 

9

the stake in the ground at least could last for three 

10

weeks, so every three weeks, they come along and stick 

11

the stake back in the ground.  You are saying the only 

12

way they can distinguish is by looking at whether it has 

13

a stake in the ground or whether it's in concrete, and 

14

yet that seems to me that doesn't help the  that 

15

doesn't answer the city's legitimate concern. 

16

 MR. CORTMAN: 

But I think what is important 

17

here is that  if the city, the town has already 

18

agreed that an election is an event, and so we have an 

19

election that's an event, but yet that single event sign 

20

can be up for five months, and yet we have an event 

21

where that single event can only be up overnight.  And 

22

so it's already made that determination that it would 

23

allow those types of signs for what I think is a 

24

comparable use, a single event to a single event. 

25

 The other thing I would say is if you allow

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

signs to be up for one single event for five months, 

2

certainly there should be some way to say, well, if we 

3

have a recurring event as we do here, certainly the sign 

4

should be allowed up at least equal to the same time, 

5

and 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I mean, to say that 

7

an election is a single event in the same way as a 

8

football game, a cookout, a basketball championship, 

9

it's  it seems to me is a very difficult thing for 

10

this Court to have to decide.  It's just not  a 

11

political campaign is a dynamic that goes on for some 

12

weeks that the signs initiate a discussion. Now I can see 

13

where you can say the religious sign does or at least 

14

should initiate the same discussion of  on issues that 

15

are certainly of the same importance, if not more. 

16

 MR. CORTMAN: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Certainly 
But it seems to me you are 

18

forcing us into making a very wooden distinction that 

19

could result in a proliferation of signs for birthday 

20

parties or for every conceivable event that could be up 

21

for five months. 

22

 MR. CORTMAN: 

But I think the problem is 

23

there  there already is that here, because we have an 

24

unlimited number of political signs.  And so if the 

25

streets are already littered in an unlimited number of

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

political signs, which they are, then how serious is the 

2

town's interest to reduce clutter?  And I think that's 

3

the problem.  The way to reduce clutter is to say, for 

4

example, many different ways, you can only have one sign 

5

per block, five signs total.  It could only be a certain 

6

size. 

7

 But it's hard to take the interests 

8

seriously of reducing clutter when it allows political 

9

signs to clutter the entire town in an unlimited number 

10

for the entire year.  The church's signs or an event 

11

signs are not the problem.  What we have here is  is 

12

carte blanche authority for political signs to clutter 

13

the landscape, unlimited in number for the entire year, 

14

and yet the concern is for maybe a few more signs that 

15

may be placed. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Can the town say that signs 

17

relating to a onetime event, an election or anything 

18

else that occurs on a particular date, have to be taken 

19

down within a period of time after that event?  And if 

20

can say that, isn't that contentbased, the way you 

21

define that concept? 

22

 MR. CORTMAN: 

I don't believe it is.  In 

23

fact, the Washington, D.C., municipal regulations have 

24

that exact code, and  and it's one that we would 

25

recommend to the Court.  I believe it's 13605.

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And what it says is all temporary signs 

2

should be treated the same, period.  You can put  you 

3

have to put your date on the sign for when you put it 

4

up.  Every temporary sign can be up for 180 days.  If 

5

it's tied to an event, after the event is over, it needs 

6

to be down 30 days after the event. 

7

 I think  our opinion is the reason that is 

8

contentneutral is whenever something is over, if your 

9

store is closed, the event is done, then the sign can be 

10

removed.  But the important part is every sign can be up 

11

for the same amount of time, even if it is that event 

12

that's over now.  And I think that's the way you 

13

deal with these  these single event 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I thought you said the way 

15

you distinguish between temporary signs and permanent 

16

signs is based on the  the nature of the sign, not 

17

what it says. 

18

 MR. CORTMAN: 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Right. 
So that gets you over the 

20

problem Justice Sotomayor mentioned about having to read 

21

the sign. 

22

 MR. CORTMAN: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Right. 
But if this  if there's a 

24

rule that says the sign has to be down within a certain 

25

period of time after the date of the event, which is on

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the sign, I don't see how you get around to reading the 

2

sign. 

3

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Well, what you would be 

4

reading is the date, and  and the code requires the 

5

date to be placed on the sign both for when the sign is 

6

placed and  and for  you know, for what the event 

7

is.  But I think that

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So if somebody puts up a 

sign for a yard sale two days before the yard sale, then 

10

they can  that can stay up for 48 days after the yard 

11

sale?  It has 50 days or whatever the period of time is? 

12

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Yes, according to  according 

13

to the code.  But what is interesting, that time period 

14

can be anything the town desires.  It  it doesn't need 

15

to be  and we're not looking for signs all year long. 

16

 The town can say, for example, temporary 

17

signs can be up for seven days, they can be a certain 

18

size.  Like Washington, D.C., does, you can only have 

19

three signs per block, have to be spaced out.  And 

20

and that's part of our point. 

21

 And I think one of the things to take a 

22

to take look at is the amici brief that's been filed on 

23

behalf of the town by the National League of Cities, and 

24

the reason that brief is important, for example, on 

25

page 10 and 13, it lists dozens and

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MR. CORTMAN: 

What page? 
Page 10 of the amici brief on 

3

behalf of the National League of Cities on behalf of the 

4

town.  And the reason I point out this brief is we don't 

5

believe that the contentneutral regulation would tie 

6

the hands of the town because, as  as they say, there 

7

are dozens and dozens of ways to regulate signs on a 

8

contentneutral way.  For example, and this has to do 

9

with permanent signs 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

11

 MR. CORTMAN: 

12

What page is this again? 
This is page 10 on the 

National League of Cities' amici brief. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Got it. 
It says you can regulate 

15

locational criteria, offsite signs, number of signs, 

16

spacing, setbacks, placement criteria, roof sign, ground 

17

signs, wall signs, projecting signs.  And all my point 

18

is, as we look through their brief, there are 

19

innumerable ways for the Court  excuse me  for the 

20

town to regulate signs. 

21

 There is no reason to look at the content of 

22

the sign, and the reason is the content of the sign 

23

affects the  the government interest of safety and 

24

aesthetics in the same way.  If  if you have, for 

25

example, clutter, whether it's the church's sign or a

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

political sign, it's going to clutter the roadways the 

2

same way. 

3

 So the way to deal with clutter is an easy 

4

rule, and, in fact, even the town concedes that the 

5

contentbased test that this Court has  has used and 

6

that the majority of the circuits now use in the sign 

7

context  the First Circuit, the Second Circuit, the 

8

Eighth Circuit, and the Eleventh apply this test to sign 

9

codes, and what they say, it's actually easier for the 

10
11

town because you don't
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

For the towns it might be. 

12

What about there are vast areas of the country where 

13

there is scenery and people want to keep the scenery the 

14

same, and they don't want signs at all, but they don't 

15

want to say no signs because someone who wants to put up 

16

a sign that says Geronimo is buried 50 feet away from 

17

here. 

18

 MR. CORTMAN: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
Now, if they say, okay, 

20

we'll make an exception for that, does that mean that 

21

they have to have an exception for everything, and 

22

pretty soon the entire State of Wyoming is just filled 

23

with clutter? 

24
25

 MR. CORTMAN: 

I wouldn't say everything. 

But what I would say is  is contentneutral

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

categories.  But they can say, for example, each person 

2

could 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no, it's not a 

4

contentneutral category.  What it is, is it is a 

5

category that says if you want to say Geronimo is buried 

6

here you can, because that will bring people to look at 

7

the grave, and that's it; we don't want anything else. 

8

We're trying to keep the place looking nice. 

9

 Now, that's not a city. 

Cities are filled 

10

with clutter anyway, at least most parts.  But that's 

11

so  so what is  I'm trying to drive at what is your 

12

definition of "contentneutral," which is something that 

13

I wonder since I think the entire U.S. Code is filled 

14

with content distinctions.  All of crime is filled with 

15

content distinctions.  All of regulation has content 

16

distinctions. 

17

 So what is it precisely in respect to the 

18

contentneutral rule that is consistent with the U.S. 

19

Code and is consistent with the example, if any, that I 

20

gave? 

21

 MR. CORTMAN: 

The definition we would 

22

propose is the same one this Court has used since the 

23

Mosley case about what is contentbased, and that is if 

24

there  the restriction or the regulation looks at the 

25

subject matter, looks at 

21

No, try  try the criminal

code and solicitation, where if you solicit for certain 

3

things you commit serious crimes, and if you commit

certain  solicit for certain other things, they are 

5

less serious and so forth.  We all know that.  How does 

6

your definition apply there?

 MR. CORTMAN:

been able to understand how they apply in many cases. 
 MR. CORTMAN:

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no, I'm sorry.  There's 

16

a free speech question under criminal law.  Does the 

17

First Amendment permit solicitation of drugs to be 

18

punished less or more seriously?  You understand what I'm 

19

driving at 

20

 MR. CORTMAN: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22
23

I do. 
 think of the U.S. Code, 

and what I want and hoping for is enlightenment. 
 MR. CORTMAN: 

I think if there is  it's a 

24

conductrelated offense, we don't get into free speech. 

25

If there is a free speech offense, even under the Code,

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I believe this Court's cases say, for example, there are 

2

vagueness cases where there are criminal laws.  This, in 

3

fact, is a criminal law.  If you continue to put up your 

4

signs, you could actually get fined and jail time.  So I 

5

believe the First Amendment would also apply if it's 

6

speechrelated. 

7

 An answer to your hypothetical, I think 

8

there are many ways for the locality to regulate those 

9

signs.  For example, if it doesn't want many signs, it 

10

can say one person can put up a temporary sign or a 

11

permanent sign or whatever have you. 

12

 But to say, for example, you could put up a 

13

private sign because you think this one location is 

14

interesting, what if another person has a location they 

15

want people to come visit?  Should the government be 

16

able to say, well, we think your location is important, 

17

but your location is not. 

18

 And our response is the government could put 

19

up the sign if it  if it wants to make that choice 

20

about historical landmarks or other types of signs or 

21

directional types of signs. 

22

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN. 

3

7

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 
 SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 We agree with Petitioners that Respondents' 

8

ordinance here is unconstitutional, but we think that a 

9

contextspecific intermediate scrutiny approach should 

10

apply in evaluating speechpermissive exceptions to a 

11

sign ordinance where those exceptions are based on the 

12

same longstanding traditional rationales that justify 

13

the sign ordinance as a whole. 

14

 A wooden application of strict scrutiny in 

15

this context would suggest that it's presumptively 

16

unconstitutional, for example, for a town to limit signs 

17

on public property but have an exception if you want to 

18

paint your street number on your curb. 

19

 Now, that doesn't make a great deal of 

20

practical sense, and that's not an example I just made 

21

up.  That's essentially the ordinance that this Court 

22

upheld, albeit without specifically addressing this 

23

particular issue, in Taxpayers for Vincent. 

24
25

 On a theoretical level, the normal reasons 
for deep judicial skepticism of exceptions to a

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

regulation of speech don't apply in the context of that 

2

street address exception, exceptions for danger or 

3

safety signs, or other types of exceptions that track 

4

the normal safety and nonproliferation rationales for a 

5

sign regulation.  Those kinds of exceptions don't create 

6

any inference that the government is attempting to favor 

7

one viewpoint or another, that it's trying to limit the 

8

set of ideas that are going to come into the public 

9

marketplace, or that it doesn't truly believe in the 

10

safety and nonproliferation rationales that underlie the 

11

sign regulation as a whole. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I mean, you 

13

you obviously know the difficulty with that, which is 

14

how does the government decide when there should be an 

15

exception or how does a court decide when there should 

16

be an exception and when there shouldn't be?  I mean, I 

17

understood the whole point of the strict scrutiny for 

18

contentbased restrictions is to find out which are the 

19

types of speech or the particular types of regulation 

20

that should be given an exception, rather than starting 

21

with saying, well, you don't apply this scrutiny because 

22

there ought to be an exception. 

23

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, I think the main problem 

24

with strict scrutiny in this context is it sends a 

25

signal to legislatures that they are on safer ground if

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they enact a broad and undifferentiated restriction on 

2

signs than if they try to tailor it only to those types 

3

of signs that actually cause the problem that they are 

4

trying to prevent. 

5

 And I think that the way the Court can 

6

manage the situation is to see whether, under 

7

intermediate scrutiny, there really are safety andor 

8

nonproliferation rationales that track onto whatever 

9

exception is being drawn. 

10

 So if we could use, for example, Justice 

11

Sotomayor's example of the "For Sale" signs.  A town 

12

might permissibly have an ordinance that limits the 

13

number of signs you can have on your lawn to two, two 

14

signs of any type; but it might also say, you know, 

15

we're not going to count "for Sale" signs against your 

16

quota of two and the reason is that "For Sale" signs are 

17

only up on a very small percentage of properties at any 

18

given of time, they are up for a very limited purpose 

19

when the property is for sale, and they go down once the 

20

sale is consummated. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And you want us to sort 

22

sort these ordinances out one by one and examine each of 

23

these exceptions and say, you know, this is okay and 

24

this isn't okay?  I don't know that the Federal 

25

Judiciary is numerous enough to do that, and it's a much

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

more simple rule that the other side presents:  Treat 

2

all signs the same.  If clutter is the problem, they all 

3

clutter.  And you shouldn't  you shouldn't allow or 

4

disallow on the basis of the message. 

5

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, it's a simple 

6

rule, but I think it's an extremely impractical rule 

7

that is going to foreclose experimentation and local 

8

solutions to local problems. 

9

 Let me give you another example of a town 

10

that has some sort of sign restriction, but it doesn't 

11

apply that sign restriction to safety signs like 

12

"Children at Play" or "Hidden Driveway Ahead."  If you 

13

are going to apply strict scrutiny to those kinds of 

14

exceptions, they are probably not going to pass muster 

15

unless it's a really watereddown version of strict 

16

scrutiny that I think is unfamiliar to the courts. 

17
18
19

 There is actually a fairly robust 
empirically 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What is the problem?  You 

20

make  you make your sign limits big enough that those 

21

signs will attract attention, that's all. 

22

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, I think towns 

23

legitimately should not have to be put to the choice if 

24

they want to prevent the proliferation of signs that 

25

would cause safety problems 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Or have the town put up the 

2

 signs, in which case they can be as big as the town 

3

 wants.  We're just talking about private signs here. 

4

 MR. FEIGIN: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Your Honor, I'm not 
So you're  you're saying 

6

 every private individual has to have a big sign, 

7

 "Children At Play," right? 

8
9

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, I don't want to resist 

 too hard the idea that the Government can put up any 

10

 signs it wants, but I think the reason we think the 

11

 Government could put up the signs here is not because 

12

 the Government can say that it can speak on certain 

13

 topics and private citizens can't, but because of the 

14

 nature of the signs that are being put up, which means 

15

 that some work has to be done here by the fact that the 

16

 types of signs I described are safety signs. 

17

 Now, if we're going to subject 

that kind of 

18

 exception to strict scrutiny, it turns out there's actually 

19

 a fairly robust empirical debate about whether "Children 

20

 At Play" signs or "Hidden Driveway Ahead" signs actually 

21

 do enhance safety.  And courts are going to have to make a 

22

 onesizefitsall conclusion about whether the state of 

23

 the evidence, which right now is fairly equivocal, 

24

 justifies that sort of exception. I think courts are 

25

 likely 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Counsel, I'm not

2

 sure  I'm not sure your whole approach is not 

3

 precluded by our decision in McCullen.  There, we said 

4

 that a facially neutral law does not become content

5

 based simply because it may disproportionately affect 

6

 certain types of certain topics.  And we said the 

7

 question in such a case  in other words, when you are 

8

 dealing with a facially neutral law  is whether the 

9

 law is justified without reference to the content.  So 

10

 it seems to me that you've got to get over the content 

11

 neutrality.  Your argument only applies when it's 

12

 content neutral and yet here we're dealing with a 

13

 situation where you're saying it's an exception to the 

14

 contentbased rule. 

15

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, I think 

16

 the Court can deal with the competing interests in this 

17

 case more easily not by getting bogged down in the 

18

 definition of contentbased and contentneutral, which I 

19

 can address in a second, but by focusing more on the 

20

 bottomline question of whether this is an appropriate 

21

 case for the application of strict scrutiny or 

22

 intermediate scrutiny. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

When you use those labels 

24

 in the context of the First Amendment, do they mean the 

25

 same thing that they mean in equal protection?  That is, 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 intermediate scrutiny is a pretty tough standard in

2

 equal protection. 

3

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, I think there are a 

4

 couple of flavors of intermediate scrutiny, both under 

5

 the Constitution at large and under the First Amendment 

6

 in particular.  I think here we would be urging 

7

 something more like a reasonable fit test, which we 

8

 think would give municipalities enough room to draw the 

9

 kinds of distinctions that I think they reasonably 

10

 should be able to make between painting your street 

11

 number on your curb so people can more easily find your 

12

 house and restrictions on, you know, particular types of 

13

 speech that are much more likely to be motivated by 

14

 disagreement with that speech. 

15

 We do think that intermediate scrutiny has a 

16

 fair amount of teeth in the circumstance, I mean, and 

17

 we're putting our money where our mouth is because we 

18

 think that the particular ordinance at issue here fails 

19

 intermediate scrutiny. 

20

 But intermediate scrutiny would give 

21

 municipalities enough room to draw these kinds of 

22

 distinctions and to draw, in particular, the kinds of 

23

 distinctions that are drawn in the Highway 

24

 Beautification Act, which allows certain types of signs 

25

 that do enhance safety and aesthetics, but generally 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 doesn't allow the ground on the sides of freeways to

2

 become a breeding ground for signs which would decrease 

3

 driver safety and decrease appreciation

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you think that a 

 I'm sorry. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Justice Sotomayor. 
Do you think that a 

8

 library could say big books are preferable to little 

9

 books and it so happens that big books are coffee books 

10

 and little books tend to be mostly political, so we're 

11

 going to put all the political books in the basement and 

12

 all the big books on the main floor? 

13
14
15

 Is that a distinction that the First 
 Amendment permits? 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

I think a court might be 

16

 reasonably fairly skeptical of that kind of distinction. 

17

 But I think signs, Your Honor, present particular First 

18

 Amendment problems that the Court had to grapple with 

19

 and didn't quite resolve in MetroMedia and City of 

20

 Ladue. 

21

 One distinct problem with signs is that 

22

 the  it's very difficult for legislatures to tailor 

23

 sign regulations and describe types of signs that it 

24

 doesn't think it needs to regulate to advance its 

25

 interest, thereby allow more speech, without describing 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 those types of signs in a manner that could be viewed as

2

 contentbased.  And that's what makes sign regulation 

3

 very difficult and why we think some sort of 

4

 contextspecific rule in this circumstance would be 

5

 appropriate. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't see why.  I mean, 

7

 you say it, but why is it true?  Just make whatever the 

8

 sign requirement is big enough that any private signs 

9

 that need to get people's attention will get people's 

10

 attention. 

11

 MR. FEIGIN: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I think 
What you say about signs I 

13

 assume applies to noise as well, right?  If the city has 

14

 a noise ordinance, it can distinguish between noises for 

15

 various purposes.  A political sound truck before an 

16

 election can be given a higher allowance, and, I don't 

17

 know, a street evangelist given a lower allowance. 

18

 MR. FEIGIN: 

I don't think that would be 

19

 permissible, Your Honor.  I think one key here is that 

20

 the types of exceptions we're talking about, the only 

21

 types we think should be subject to intermediate 

22

 scrutiny, are ones that track the safety and 

23

 nonproliferation rationales for the sign ordinance as a 

24

 whole.  If the City is advancing a distinction based on 

25

 the fact that they think political speech or ideological 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 speech is more valuable than, say, religious speech, we

2

 think that would be subject to strict scrutiny.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. SAVRIN 

7
8
9

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 please the Court: 

10

 The problem with applying strict scrutiny in 

11

 this case or this type of case is that it will have, we 

12

 believe, the opposite effect.  It will limit speech 

13

 because towns, cities will enact one size fits all.  In 

14

 order to do that, as Petitioner's counsel indicated, 

15

 there need to be limitations on the number of signs, on 

16

 the duration of signs.  The signs would have to be all 

17

 large enough to accommodate the largest message that 

18

 needs to be communicated. 

19

 And in order to pass strict scrutiny, the 

20

 legislatures in these towns and cities across this 

21

 country would be inclined to ban all signs except those 

22

 that the First Amendment absolutely allows. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You can make that argument 

24

 in all kinds of contexts.  I don't know where it gets 

25

 you.  Suppose that the question is, whether the town is 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 going to allow anybody to speak in a park, and the

2

 town  the town council says, well, you know, we would 

3

 like to have people be able to speak on subjects that we 

4

 like, but there are some subjects we really don't like. 

5

 We don't want people to speak on those.  So we have the 

6

 choice, we allow everybody to speak or we allow nobody 

7

 to speak. 

8

 So you can make exactly that same argument in lots 

9

 of other contexts where I don't think the distinction 

10
11

 could be justified.  Isn't that right? 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

I think there is a difference, 

12

 Justice Alito, in signs as opposed to speech because 

13

 signs do take up physical space.  They displace other 

14

 uses of land, and they perform different functions. 

15

 One thing that we would like to emphasize in 

16

 this case is that the temporary directional sign 

17

 provision is limited to in signs that are intended to 

18

 guide travelers along a route from Point A to Point B. 

19

 If they have expressive content on them, then they are 

20

 no longer a directional sign but are then an expressive 

21

 sign; and there is a different provision that applies 

22

 for that. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So if the sign here said, 

24

 "We welcome you to attend our church service," and then 

25

 it says on the bottom, meeting place, and it specifies 

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the meeting place, but the message is "we welcome you to

2

 attend our service," that's ideological? 

3

 MR. SAVRIN: 

That is ideological.  That 

4

 would not be a directional sign because it's not 

5

 directing travelers along  along the route to that 

6

 location. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it says also "welcome 

8

 you to attend our church service, it will be held at." 

9

 So it's giving the direction, but it's also expressing 

10
11

 the message that everyone is welcome to come worship. 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

I believe the way that this 

12

 code has been interpreted, Justice Ginsburg, is that 

13

 that would not be a directional sign because it's not 

14

 saying turn right, turn left, go straight a few miles. 

15

 It's not giving directions about how to get there. 

16

 So I believe that that type of sign would be 

17

 permitted under this ordinance as an ideological sign 

18

 and would not be limited to the terms of the temporary 

19

 directional. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Savrin, could I ask what 

21

 the  your justification is for these specially 

22

 generous provisions on ideological signs?  I mean, 

23

 putting aside the level of scrutiny, why do you have 

24

 these very generous rules for ideological signs as 

25

 compared to others? 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. SAVRIN: 

Well, specifically on the

2

 ideological signs is to protect the First Amendment 

3

 right of anyone to speak on any topic at any time.  The 

4

 difference in the 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So you are not even 

6

 purporting to have a contentneutral justification for 

7

 this.  You are essentially saying, yes, we generally 

8

 dislike clutter, but we're willing to make exceptions 

9

 for clutter for speech that we think has special First 

10
11

 Amendment significance. 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

That would not be our position, 

12

 Justice Kagan.  Our position is that it's not 

13

 contentbased in a constitutional sense for purposes of 

14

 applying strict scrutiny, that the distinction is 

15

 permissible here without relation to the content or in 

16

 terms of favoring or censoring certain viewpoints or 

17

 ideas. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, viewpoint 

19

 discrimination is quite different from content 

20

 discrimination.  And you are trying to reduce our rules 

21

 against discriminating on the basis of content to a rule 

22

 against viewpoint discrimination. 

23

 MR. SAVRIN: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Not just view 
I mean, ideological signs, 

 that is a content category, and there is as much a First 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Amendment right to give somebody directions as there is

2

 to speak about  about being green or whatever else. 

3

 Is there no First Amendment right to give somebody 

4

 directions? 

5

 MR. SAVRIN: 

Justice Scalia, we would say 

6

 that the  they perform different functions.  It 

7

 certainly 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They sure do, but is there 

 a First Amendment right for these other messages or not? 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

I think they would have a right 

11

 to speak, and I think that they do have that right to 

12

 speak and that intermediate scrutiny applies to 

13

 regulations about how speech can be communicated as 

14

 opposed to what can be communicated. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you did say in your 

16

 brief that the First Amendment does not require 

17

 directional signs, so they could be banned altogether. 

18

 MR. SAVRIN: 

I think if it's narrowly 

19

 tailored and meets the intermediate scrutiny test in a 

20

 particular jurisdiction, then 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, that is a lot of 

 words.  I'm giving you an example. 
 The law says no directional signs. 

That's 

24

 the law.  Does that  is  does that offend the First 

25

 Amendment? 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SAVRIN: 

I think that it  well, when

2

 you say offend the First Amendment, I think you would 

3

 have to apply the intermediate scrutiny analysis and our 

4

 position would be that it would  that it could survive 

5

 that analysis. 

6

 If I could return to Justice Kagan's 

7

 question about the interests that are served, it's 

8

 different.  A directional sign, there needs to be more 

9

 than in order to direct travelers along a route, so that 

10

 justifies a  perhaps a smaller size.  There is no 

11

 contention in the record; in fact, the court of appeals 

12

 found that they function as intended.  As far as the 

13

 duration is concerned, there's no travelers going to an 

14

 event that is not presently occurring.  In fact, the 

15

 Town of Gilbert expanded the time frame from 2 hours to 

16

 12 hours, and I  our question is whether or not that 

17

 is something that implicates First Amendment 

18

 jurisprudence as opposed to 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You say on  suppose we're 

20

 talking about the context of signs.  You say, well, 

21

 let's look to the purpose of forbidding  any 

22

 prohibition, and I guess it has to do with safety or 

23

 beautification. 

24

 MR. SAVRIN: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
First question would be: 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Is there some category that you don't allow to put up

2

 signs?  Answer, no.  Everybody can put up signs. 

3

 So what about applying strict scrutiny to 

4

 that?  If you are going to distinguish on the basis of 

5

 what the sign says, you have to have an awfully good 

6

 reason, if your decision is you can't put up one at all. 

7

 Next, you put them up, but you have all content  all 

8

 kinds of distinctions how, how long, et cetera. 

9

 Now, in respect to that, maybe you should 

10

 have more leeway, leeway depending upon the purpose of 

11

 the sign.  So if, for example, it's about an open air, 

12

 municipal movie, you could say put up signs about movies 

13

 or something.  I mean, you know, you maybe have more 

14

 leeway there. 

15

 But still they're saying you would flunk 

16

 even that test here because there isn't really a very 

17

 good reason at all in this case for making the sign 

18

 smaller or for putting it there for such a short time. 

19

 Now, how do you react  there are three 

20

 parts:  One, very tough if you are going to say you 

21

 can't put it up at all, sometimes called strict 

22

 scrutiny; two, somewhat more lenient if it gets up, but 

23

 you are trying to distinguish among how and under what 

24

 circumstances, how long; and then three, do you even 

25

 satisfy that one?  That's called time, place and manner, 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 the second one.
 MR. SAVRIN: 

Yes, okay.  Well, with respect 

3

 to the first one, the interest most of the times in sign 

4

 ordinance regulations as the  as you've indicated, is 

5

 aesthetics and safety.  With respect to aesthetics, I 

6

 don't believe that that would meet the definition of a 

7

 compelling interest, so that it's  it's automatically, 

8

 presumptively, and conclusively unconstitutional if the 

9

 strict scrutiny is applied and that's the  there is no 

10
11

 compelling interest. 
 With respect to the interests at stake here, 

12

 we again believe that directional signs are functionally 

13

 different from an ideological sign or even from a 

14

 political sign, that the directional signs do not need 

15

 to be larger and also that there are more of them.  And 

16

 so if there are more of them, the tradeoff is  at 

17

 least the legislature in this town has decided the 

18

 tradeoff is that they need to be smaller because they 

19

 need to guide travelers along a route. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And political signs are 

21

 there almost all year, on the rightsofway.  You talk 

22

 about clutter.  What if somebody doesn't like politics, 

23

 and he says politics is spinach.  I want ideology.  I 

24

 would like ideological signs on the rightofway.  You 

25

 say, I'm sorry, you are wrong, we think politics is more 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 important, because we are politicians and we're on the

2

 city council. 

3

 (Laughter.) 

4

 MR. SAVRIN: 

I have two responses to that, 

5

 Justice Scalia.  The first one is that there is a 

6

 statute in Arizona that this ordinance complies with in 

7

 terms of the placement, the duration, and the size of 

8

 the political signs.  The town doesn't have any leeway 

9

 in that because it needs to comply with the statute. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Does this State statute 

11

 have the same size and duration?  The State statute says 

12

 that you have to allow political signs, but does it 

13

 specify the size and the duration? 

14

 MR. SAVRIN: 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

16

 MR. SAVRIN: 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 MR. SAVRIN: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

Yes.  Yes, it does. 
And do you have that 

 State law? 

20

22

So you're saying that the 

 town ordinance just mirrors the State? 

17

19

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it does. 

I do.  It's section 161019. 
So your defense to a First 

 Amendment complaint is, what, the State made me do it? 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

Well, our defense  well, in 

24

 part, yes, because we need to comply with the statute, 

25

 and it doesn't make sense that, as a result, all signs 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 need to be  meet those provisions for purposes of

2

 preserving beauty, reducing clutter, so on and so forth. 

3
4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It makes a lot of sense if 

 you believe in the First Amendment. 

5

 MR. SAVRIN: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well 
If you believe that neither 

7

 the State nor the city is entitled to say politics is 

8

 really important, as opposed to music. 

9

 MR. SAVRIN: 

The other consideration here, 

10

 Justice Scalia, is that we're talking about public 

11

 property.  And one of the issues that has not been 

12

 developed, certainly in the record in this  at this 

13

 Court, is the extent to which the government can select 

14

 subject matter for what is a nontraditional public 

15

 forum.  So there are issues as well that would need to 

16

 be developed a little bit further before any application 

17

 of intermediate scrutiny, we say, could be continued 

18

 if they  if the  if their  if this Court were to 

19

 find problems with the Ninth Circuit's application of 

20

 intermediate scrutiny, and I think that there would 

21

 still be some issues on location that would need to be 

22

 developed on the public forum, and that 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You say the street is not 

 a  not a traditional public forum? 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

That is the  certainly 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Gilbert's position.  It was something that was argued in

2

 the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit did not resolve 

3

 that issue.  But I believe that would be a question of 

4

 Arizona law. 

5

 But, again, we have not developed that and 

6

 that issue has not been developed in this  at this 

7

 in this Court, and I think the reason is because the 

8

 issue in this Court is whether or not strict scrutiny 

9

 applies. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, how do you justify 

11

 the  the differing treatments of Petitioner's sign, on 

12

 the one hand, and the weekend builder event signs and 

13

 homeowners' association signs?  Homeowners' association 

14

 signs can be 80 square feet, and the Petitioner's sign 

15

 can be 6 square feet. 

16

 MR. SAVRIN: 

The homeowners' signs are not 

17

 really directional signs, because they can only be 

18

 within the residential community.  They are not 

19

 directing travelers off site, in a generic sense, to a 

20

 location.  There is also a permit requirement. 

21

 And the other thing is  about the 80 

22

 square feet is, that is total sign area.  That's not one 

23

 sign.  That's the total sign area you can have. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
 denied one of those permits? 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Has anyone ever been 

Official

1

 MR. SAVRIN: 

2

 question, Your Honor. 

3

I don't know the answer to that

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Suppose the Petitioners want 

4

 to put up a sign that says, we're having a church 

5

 service at 10:00 o'clock on Sunday morning.  Under your 

6

 code, when can they put that up and when do they have to 

7

 take it down? 

8
9

 MR. SAVRIN: 

They could put it up 12 hours 

 before, so that would be 10:00 o'clock p.m., and they 

10

 could take it  and they have to take down, I believe 

11

 it's an hour afterwards. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So they can put it up after 

13

 dark on Saturday and then they have to take it down 

14

 within an hour after, when, the commencement of the 

15

 service, or 

16

 MR. SAVRIN: 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

18

 MR. SAVRIN: 

19
20

The end of the event. 
 the end of this 
The end of the event.  If 

 the 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you think that really 

21

 gives them an opportunity to invite people to come to 

22

 their service? 

23

 MR. SAVRIN: 

The purpose of these signs is 

24

 not supposed to be invitational; it's supposed to be 

25

 directional.  If the event was occurring at 10:00 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 o'clock at night or at 6:00 o'clock in the evening, it

2

 could be up during the day.  If the event occurs all 

3

 weekend long, it could be up all weekend long.  It's 

4

 it's tied to the event. 

5

 So in that sense, it  it absolutely serves 

6

 its purpose for having on  on the 12 hours before, 

7

 because if they want to invite members of the public to 

8

 the services, they can and do have many other 

9

 opportunities and alternatives  including signage, 

10

 including the ideological sign  that they can use. 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So they could put up a, 

12

 quote/unquote, ideological sign that says, "Come to our 

13

 service on Sunday morning," but no arrow, and then they 

14

 put up another sign that says, this is the arrow?  Or 

15

 maybe they put up on the first sign, "Come to our 

16

 service on Sunday morning; we can't tell you now where 

17

 it will be because the town won't let us, but if you 

18

 come  if you drive by here tomorrow morning at a 

19

 certain time, you will see an arrow." 

20

 (Laughter.) 

21

 MR. SAVRIN: 

The sign could say, Your Honor, 

22

 where it is taking place, but if it is intending to 

23

 guide travelers to that location, then it would need to 

24

 comply with  with the provisions.  And the reason, 

25

 again 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What is the  what is

2

 the guidance?  I'm looking at the Good News signs on 

3

 page 3 of the little brief.  It just has an arrow.  It 

4

 says the name of the elementary school, and then it 

5

 has  it looks like a telephone number and an arrow. 

6

 The arrow is the  direction? 

7

 MR. SAVRIN: 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

9

 on Front Street. 

11

 MR. SAVRIN: 

13

This is not, as you 

 described earlier, turn left on Main Street, turn right 

10

12

Yes, Your Honor. 

It is the same function as 

 that.  But we would say the 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What is this about, this 

14

 argument?  I mean, you agree they can put up a big sign. 

15

 Can they put up a big sign, ideological, saying, "Come 

16

 to the church  service next Tuesday, 4th and H Streets, 

17

 three blocks right and two blocks left"?  All right?  Or 

18

 are you saying they can't say, "three blocks right and 

19

 two blocks left"? And that's what this argument is about? 

20

 MR. SAVRIN: 

That is what it comes down to. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, my goodness.  I 

22

 mean  I mean, on that, it does sound as if the town is 

23

 being a little unreasonable, doesn't it? 

24
25

 MR. SAVRIN: 

Well, we would say that it 

 has  that the sign has an  what this Court has 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 termed an incidental effect on the expression of the

2

 Petitioners, that certainly they can have the 

3

 ideological sign, the information that they want to 

4

 include 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Suppose we said this:  That 

6

 where, in fact, the argument is of this nature, where, 

7

 in fact, there are  you can have a big sign and have 

8

 everything on it except an arrow, and the purpose of the 

9

 sign is, in fact, to tell people both what is happening 

10

 and where.  That there is no good, under any test, 

11

 reason for requiring this little dingy thing?  End of 

12

 the case.  Let's go with that. 

13

 MR. SAVRIN: 

Well, Your Honor  our 

14

 response to that, Your Honor, is that the directional 

15

 signs, in order to work, need to guide travelers along 

16

 the route.  So there's going to be a whole lot of these 

17

 signs in order for them to function as intended.  It can 

18

 be a mile away, it can be two miles away. 

19

 So having just one sign, perhaps, under 

20

 the Court's hypothetical, it seems rather silly, but if 

21

 you are thinking about having a whole bunch of these 

22

 signs over a long distance, then I think then that 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Does Good News  does 

24

 the Good News church have a number of signs  just as 

25

 illustration, how many signs do they have? 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SAVRIN: 

I believe the number is 15, but

2

 I'm not 100 percent sure about that, Your Honor.  I know 

3

 that they have quite a few. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can you see that car 

5

 when you  can you see that sign at all when you 

6

 pass 

7

 MR. SAVRIN: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9
10

I'm sorry, Your Honor? 
Can you see that sign at 

 all when you pass in a moving car? 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

Yes.  In fact, the court of 

11

 appeals has found that it functioned as intended and 

12

 there is no indication that  that it did not.  So 

13

 there's  it seems to me that those are the kind of 

14

 decisions, as far as size, duration, are ones that 

15

 should be the fodder  of legislative deliberation.  And 

16

 as long as it meets the intermediate scrutiny test, it 

17

 should pass Constitutional muster. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Whatever that is.  Whatever 

 that is, right? 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

Well, the intermediate scrutiny 

21

 test, I think, is if it's narrowly tailored, and also if 

22

 there are alternative modes of communication.  But I 

23

 think that applying strict scrutiny to these types of 

24

 regulations will result in sign ordinances being struck 

25

 down uniformly, just about, and the only speech that 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that will be allowed will be speech that is

2

 constitutionally required.  Everything else will not be. 

3

 But I think the problem, if there is one, 

4

 that Gilbert has gotten into is that it allows a lot of 

5

 speech that a lot of other ordinances might not in a lot 

6

 of different formats. 

7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Just, again, if I could 

 understand 
 MR. SAVRIN: 

Yes. 

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 let's even assume that 

11

 intermediate scrutiny applies, and just focus in on this 

12

 special provision for ideological speech which allows 

13

 very large signs to stay up as long as possible.  And 

14

 you would say we're making that exception, if you will, 

15

 to the general rule that there shouldn't be clutter and 

16

 there shouldn't be a lot of these signs because, why? 

17

 MR. SAVRIN: 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

19

 MR. SAVRIN: 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Because directional signs 
No, no, no. 
I'm sorry. 
I just asked you for the 

21

 exemption for ideological signs, for the specially 

22

 generous provision for ideological signs.  Why do 

23

 ideological signs get such generous treatment? 

24
25

 MR. SAVRIN: 

Because the  to protect the 

 First Amendment right to speak. 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Okay.  So that is a

2

 contentbased rationale.  And then, you know, on one theory, 

3

 you lose regardless of what the standard of review is. 

4

 MR. SAVRIN: 

If the 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You are not justifying it on 

6

 the grounds of safety or on the grounds of clutter. 

7

 You're saying, this is a special kind of speech that we 

8

 think there ought to be more of. 

9
10

 MR. SAVRIN: 

With respect to the ideological 

 sign? 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

12

 MR. SAVRIN: 

Yeah. 
Yeah, the purpose of that is 

13

 is it is contentneutral in terms of anything can be on 

14

 that sign.  And what we're saying 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So that goes back to what 

16

 Justice Scalia said.  It's viewpoint neutral, but, you 

17

 know, it's contentbased.  And maybe you are just saying 

18

 that we've run amok on this contentbased distinction, 

19

 and there would be an argument there.  But, I mean, it 

20

 is contentbased to say what is ideology and what is 

21

 not. 

22

 MR. SAVRIN: 

And I would agree that that's 

23

 what we're arguing, Your Honor, that what we're saying 

24

 is that the First Amendment is  guards against the 

25

 abridgment of speech.  And having a rigid content 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 definition to be the on/off switch for whether strict

2

 scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny applies does  is not 

3

 workable, does not achieve commonsense results.  It 

4

 handicaps the legislatures in their ability to be 

5

 flexible. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, maybe you think that, 

7

 but the guy who doesn't like politics and likes ideology 

8

 doesn't think that. 

9
10

 MR. SAVRIN: 

Well, the person 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So we're  we're supposed 

11

 to sit here and say, oh, political speech is the most 

12

 valuable and then you can allow that, but ideological speech 

13

 comes in a close second, and then what?  Then 

14

 directional speech or whatever else? 

15

 MR. SAVRIN: 

Well, I 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't want to do that.  I 

17

 don't think you should want any governmental official, 

18

 even  even a judge, to do stuff like that. 

19

 MR. SAVRIN: 

Your Honor, I think for 

20

 purposes of ruling in this case, I think the question is 

21

 whether or not the temporary directional sign is subject 

22

 to  is contentbased in a constitutional sense such 

23

 that it would be subject to strict scrutiny.  We believe 

24

 that that would be improper.  We think that it would be 

25

 against the jurisprudence of this Court.

12

 contentbased as the criterion and make it 

13

 viewpointbased. 

14

 MR. SAVRIN: 

No, Your Honor, that is not 

15

 what we're advocating.  What we're advocating is that if 

16

 an ordinance does not  if an ordinance addresses the 

17

 function of the sign as opposed to the particular ideas 

18

 or even the subject matter, then it would not be 

19

 contentbased for purposes of 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is there  is there a 

21

 difference between the function of the sign and the 

22

 content of the sign? 

23

 MR. SAVRIN: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Yes, Your Honor. 
I frankly can't grasp that. 

 What is it?

Well, it depends on how

Well, both 

               
 MR. SAVRIN: 

No.  We think that there needs

 a be a  a nuance, as the Federal government has 

13

 indicated.  So it guides the  the content test is a 

14

 guide for courts to determine which level of scrutiny 

15

 applies.  And at some level, if content is the on/off 

16

 switch, then such distinctions as temporary and 

17

 permanent, commercial and noncommercial, even onsite 

18

 and offsite, are going to be content.  And we don't

 believe that that in and of itself justifies strict

 scrutiny.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. CORTMAN 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. CORTMAN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

2

 Just a few quick points in response, if I may. 

3

 Clarification point on the State statute. 

4

 First of all, when this case began, the State statute 

5

 was not in effect, and political signs were actually 

6

 allowed up for longer than the period of time.  When the 

7

 State statute was enacted, it actually lessened that 

8

 time.  So it's not the State's doing that the town 

9

 decided to allow political signs in its  in its 

10
11

 rightofway. 
 But even with the State statute, the  if 

12

 the State has decided that its interest in free speech 

13

 in political signs outweighs the interest in safety and 

14

 aesthetics, then the town should basically adopt an 

15

 ordinance that abides by that.  And the simple way to do 

16

 that is to treat it as a constitutional floor.  If the 

17

 State has decided that we're going to allow political 

18

 signs up for that period of time  and by the way, the 

19

 statue doesn't mention other signs.  So it's not a 

20

 restriction like this town code is.  All it says is, 

21

 we've deemed it important enough for political signs to 

22

 be up for 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It's just permissive for 

 political signs. 
 MR. CORTMAN: 

That's right.  And so the 

54

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 response by the town is, okay, if that's the case and

2

 the State has decided that political signs outweigh our 

3

 interests in safety and aesthetics, the way we deal with 

4

 that is treating other similar signs the same. 

5

 I think, a couple other points, the noise 

6

 ordinance is a perfect example, whether it's the that 

7

 side case or the Kobachs case.  This ordinance would be 

8

 akin to allowing, for example, political speech to be 

9

 much louder in decibels and for longer periods of time, 

10

 and someone on the street corner inviting someone to 

11

 church must be quieter and for lesser periods of time. 

12

 And quickly, if I may address the safety and 

13

 beautification interests, they are certainly important 

14

 interests.  But as this Court said several times in 

15

 Carey v. Brown, for example, and Discovery Network, the 

16

 distinctions, the contentbased distinctions in the code 

17

 bear no relationship to the government interest.  The 

18

 distinctions don't advance those interests. 

19

 And as to being underinclusive, I think 

20

 it's similar to what this Court found in Discovery 

21

 Network.  When there the town wanted to prohibit 62 news 

22

 racks and then allow 1,500 to 2,000 news racks to 

23

 remain, this Court said that was underinclusive and 

24

 would fail just on that.  Here, the town is allowing an 

25

 unlimited number of political signs, but then 

55

 prohibiting just a few other signs.
