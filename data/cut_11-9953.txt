ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BOURKE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BOURKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Louisiana Court of Appeal in this case

12

correctly found that the majority of the delay -- the

13

seven-year delay was caused by the lack of funding, but,

14

when moving to assess that cause under Barker,

15

incorrectly determined that it was a cause beyond the

16

control of the State and, adopting its earlier ruling

17

under the State statute, found that it was a cause

18

beyond the control of the State, in the sense that it

19

was beyond the control of the local district attorney's

20

office.

21
22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Bourke, was -- was it

within the control of your client?

23

MR. BOURKE:

He was unable to fund himself,

That is why he asked for the appointment of

Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial?

3

MR. BOURKE:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. BOURKE:

Was he unable to get his

Yes.
Why?

That is -- he was unable to

6

move forward to trial because he was not provided with

7

counsel adequately funded to advance the --

10
11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:
counsel, right?

He had -- he had one

During the whole time?

MR. BOURKE:

In fact, in a sense, Your

Honor, he had two counsel.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

For part of it, he

13

had two, and then there was not enough funding for the

14

second, okay?

15

So he was faced with a choice.

Louisiana, as I understand it, has adopted a

16

provision, which the Sixth Amendment does not require.

17

The Sixth Amendment just requires counsel, but Louisiana

18

says, in capital cases, we are going to provide two

19

counsel, and you can't go to trial until you have two

20

counsel, okay?

21

MR. BOURKE:

MR. BOURKE:

is not the State of Louisiana law.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is the State of

That

Official

1

Louisiana law?

2

MR. BOURKE:

Louisiana absolutely does not

3

provide a right to two counsel in capital cases.

4

Louisiana Supreme Court, in Rule 31, provided that the

5

court should appoint two counsel, but, also, it provided

6

expressly that that created no procedural or substantive

7

right.

8

Similarly, there is no right --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't -- I don't

10

understand that.

11

that you can't proceed without two counsel?

12

the law in Louisiana?

13
14

That's not Louisiana law that you -That's not

I thought that's --

MR. BOURKE:

That is not the law in

Louisiana.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16

The

I -- you don't consider

supreme court rules to be law?

17

MR. BOURKE:

It is a supreme court rule

18

which directs the trial judge to appoint two counsel.

19

However, it makes it clear -JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

Is it the fact that, in

21

Louisiana, you cannot proceed to trial in a capital

22

case, unless there are two counsel?

23

MR. BOURKE:

24
25

No, Your Honor.

That is not

2

You should have proceeded to trial.
MR. BOURKE:

No, Your Honor.

In -- in this

3

case, as the court of appeal correctly found, Mr. Boyer

4

did not have adequate funding for the case to go to

5

trial.

6

the need for two counsel.

7

source of funds was not predicated on Rule 31.

8

The court of appeal did not predicate that on

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The one -- the one

counsel who was qualified, what was his name?
MR. BOURKE:

10
11

The motion to determine

Mr. Lorenzi was lead certified

counsel.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Lorenzi, yes.

He was

13

only one at the time who was qualified to be lead

14

counsel?

15

MR. BOURKE:

Correct.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the Louisiana Supreme

17

Court said, you don't have to do this.

18

you're his attorney, but you have a right to be paid,

19

and the State has to pay you.

20

You're his --

So there was no obligation on the counsel's

21

part to do anything; and he kept asking, please have a

22

funding order, let me be paid, and I'll do my job.

23
24
25

MR. BOURKE:

Yes, Mr. Lorenzi declined to

pay for Mr. Boyer's defense out of his own pocket.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wasn't there, at all times,

2

MR. BOURKE:

There was --


3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. BOURKE:

At all times? 


There was, at all times, one 


5

counsel appointed as associate counsel, that is for the

6

purpose of assisting Mr. Lorenzi as lead counsel.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was that counsel qualified

enough under our constitutional Sixth Amendment

jurisprudence?
MR. BOURKE:

Well, I don't understand the --

the Sixth Amendment jurisprudence to place --

Well --

-- a qualification minimum, so

I'm not sure I'm understanding your question.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

Well, the question is would

16

only lead counsel under -- under the supreme court's

17

rule qualify as competent counsel, for purposes of

18

complying with the constitutional requirement?

19

this certified second chair qualify?

20

MR. BOURKE:

Or would

The -- there is no -- I'm

21

having trouble answering the question, Justice Scalia,

22

because the two things don't talk to each other.

23

Sixth Amendment doesn't impose a certification

24

requirement.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly.

MR. BOURKE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor.
What?

The court of appeal twice

found -- knowing that associate counsel had been

appointed, the court of appeal twice found that the case

could not proceed due to a lack of adequate funding, and

MR. BOURKE:

Your Honor, if Mr. Boyer had

been brought into court and had been told, we've got

10

associate counsel here; they are qualified in the sense

11

that they are barred in Louisiana, and they can take

12

your case to trial and move it forward now.

But, if you wait, we might have funding for

You can

In that circumstance, there would not be an

But that is not what occurred here.

And,

Justice Scalia, the -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you -- can you tell me

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

why that is not what occurred here?

2

MR. BOURKE:

Because the funding problem did

3

not exist solely around Mr. Lorenzi's overhead and

4

expenditure.

5

There was no money for experts.

6

counsel who had been appointed had been appointed solely

7

and for the limited purpose as an assistant to

8

Mr. Lorenzi, not to conduct the case in his own right.

9

If this issue had been raised in the trial

There was no money for investigation.
And the associate

10

court, this would have been clearly explained into this

11

record.

12

appellate court of -- the court of appeal -- Third

13

Circuit in Louisiana knew and understood that there was

14

no investigative funding.

15

There had been an assistant.

16

It wasn't.

But the trial court and the

There was no expert funding.

This isn't the case where there was a lawyer

17

appointed and they were waiting for the second lawyer.

18

It's a case where they'd found an assistant and were

19

waiting for the first lawyer.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How much money would

21

be needed for investigation and experts before you would

22

acknowledge that that would be competent representation?

23

MR. BOURKE:

That's a very case-specific

24

determination, Your Honor and, in Louisiana, at that

25

time, rested with a judicial determination that the
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

investigative or expert expenses were reasonably

2

necessary to ensure a fair trial within the meaning of

3

the Due Process Clause.

4
5

So it -- it was a funding level tagged to
the constitutional minimum of due process.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, a finding by the

7

district court -- or whichever court found it, that

8

there was not enough money to pay counsel, to

9

investigate, and to -- to do whatever else -- buy

10

stamps -- is not a finding by the district court that

11

there was not enough money to investigate and to buy

12

stamps.

13

Counsel was a part of that mix.

You never

14

had a finding that there was not enough money to pay

15

counsel, right?

16

enough money to allow the counsel that has been

17

appointed to investigate and buy stamps.

Or -- I'm sorry -- that there was not

18

Was there ever any such finding?

19

MR. BOURKE:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21
22

There was never -The -- the big tag item

was -- was paying counsel; wasn't it?
MR. BOURKE:

No, Your Honor.

That was one

23

of the big tag items.

But, in a capital case, the

24

investigation of both the guilt phase and the full

25

mitigation and life investigation, along with the use of
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

potential expert witnesses, particularly in the case 


2

where there were all the indications of mental health 


3

problems and the like, are often equal to or, in some 


4

cases, greater than the cost of counsel. 


5

And so, no, the big -- the big tag item

6

wasn't just Mr. Lorenzi's overhead and expenses.

The

7

big tag item was providing adequate funding.

8

return to your earlier point, Justice Scalia, just to --

9

to make it clear, the Louisiana Supreme Court cases,

And to

10

which mandate that a case cannot go forward without

11

counsel, do not reference Rule 31 at all, or two

12

counsel.

13

They are cases which stand for the

14

proposition that the case cannot go forward without

15

constitutionally adequate counsel, counsel who can

16

provide reasonably effective assistance.

17

This case began in 2002.

At that point, the

18

controlling Louisiana decision on not moving forward

19

without effective assistance was Peart -- P-e-a-r-t --

20

which we cite in our brief, which said that the court

21

will not allow a case to proceed without reasonably

22

effective counsel.

23

During the life of this case -- sorry.

MR. BOURKE:

Yes, sir.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

In your point of view,

3

would it satisfy you if we say, the Louisiana court of

4

appeal found the largest part of the delay involved the

5

funding crisis experienced by the State of Louisiana --

6

that meant giving you adequate money for counsel.

7

Then they said, the progression of the

8

prosecution was out of the State's control, as

9

determined by this court, which I think referred to that

10

funding crisis.

11

that's what they said.

12

facts, but that's what they said.

13

And we could -- and your view would be
We don't know the underlying

And, insofar as they said that the State

14

wasn't responsible for that part of the delay that they

15

are talking about, they're wrong because the State is

16

responsible for not providing enough money, even if it's

17

a problem and to say they weren't responsible is wrong,

18

okay?

That's what you want us to say?

19

MR. BOURKE:

Yes, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. BOURKE:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Period.

And send it back.

Well, Your Honor -You would like us to say

23

what Judge Cook said in -- in her opinion, that

24

responsibility for funding rests with the State, not

25

with the defendant.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Once an attorney is appointed, it is the

2

State's obligation to ensure that adequate funds are

3

available for the defense.

4

to mean not simply counsel, but the witnesses, the --

5

the investigation.

6

And I take "for the defense"

It is certainly true that none of the delay

7

due to the lack of funds was, in any way, attributable

8

to the defense.

9

like us to say?
MR. BOURKE:

10
11

That's, essentially, what you would

That is what Judge Cook said

and --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think it's enough

13

that none of the delay was attributable to the defense.

14

The defense has to complain, has to demand its right to

15

a prompt trial.

16

What did your client do?

Frankly, I -- I am

17

skeptical that a capital defendant who has already

18

confessed to the crime wants to be tried as soon as

19

possible.

I'm skeptical about that.
Now, what -- what did your client do to

20
21

demand his right to a prompt trial?

22

MR. BOURKE:

Your Honor, what Mr. Boyer did

23

was act, at all times, in full compliance with the

24

procedural mechanisms set up in Louisiana for doing

25

that.

MR. BOURKE:

Well, Your Honor, the rule I am

referring to is a procedural rule.

It does not, in any

way, limit the relief from a speedy trial, but you can't

Do you dispute that a new clock started in

19

2007, the first time that the robbery charge was -- was

20

made?

21

MR. BOURKE:

We do, Your Honor.

That armed

22

robbery charge is a lesser included offense of the

23

first-degree murder count.

24

indicted on first-degree murder, which, in Louisiana, is

25

intentional killing during the course of an armed

1

robbery -- there are other varieties, of course -- but

2

intentional killing during an armed robbery.

3

are the elements of first-degree murder.

4

And those

The State unpacked those two elements -- or

5

two lesser included offenses, to second-degree murder,

6

which is intentional killing, and armed robbery.

7

the State, in fact, conceded that, had the charge

8

remained a first-degree murder charge, then the armed

9

robbery charge would have created a double jeopardy

10

And

problem.

11

And that's at page 3703 to '4 of the record,

12

where counsel for the State indicated that the armed

13

robbery charge could be added because the primary

14

charge, the -- the first-degree murder, had been dropped

15

to second-degree murder, and specifically said,

16

Mr Bourke is correct, that, had we filed for

17

first-degree murder, there may be double jeopardy

18

problems.

19

But, because they had unpacked that charge

20

from murder and armed robbery down to murder and, also,

21

armed robbery, there was no double jeopardy problem.

22

That is what --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about -- what about

24

the basic problem in this case, as I understand the

25

question presented, is should the State be responsible
17

Alderson Reporting Company

when the funding problem is at a local level?

2

So suppose you have a State that says -- you

3

know, we have had problems in funding; if we give this

4

to the counties, it's going to be much better, and the

5

counties are very, very good at raising money and

Then one county has a disaster, a hurricane

Can't the county

Well, Justice Kennedy -I take it that's the issue

that we're trying to decide here.
MR. BOURKE:

Well, I think it starts with

17

the proposition that it is the State, not the

18

prosecutor, who has the responsibility to ensure a

19

speedy trial, in accordance with due process.

20

And then the State can make all sorts of

21

different arrangements, and the States around this

22

country make different arrangements, but it's their

23

responsibility to make sure that they work.

24

they don't work, then the State is going to have to make

25

reasonable accommodation for that, to meet its

hearing.

5

to -- to the extent the State should have done more, it

6

weighs against the State.

They have to figure out what happened and

7

Do you want any more than that?

8

MR. BOURKE:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. BOURKE:

10

Yes, Your Honor.
And what else?

The first thing that we want is

11

exactly that, Your Honor, that the court below

12

incorrectly -- incorrectly failed to attribute this to

13

the State.

14

stop there and remand to the Third Circuit to deal with

15

that in accordance with --

16

And this Court -- I accept this Court could

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not -- not quite.

I mean,

17

the question presented is not as general as that.

18

much more fact-bound.

19

It's

It says whether a State's failure to fund

20

counsel for an indigent for five years, particularly

21

where failure was the direct result of the prosecution's

22

choice to seek the death penalty, should be weighed

23

against the State for speedy trial purposes.

24
25

I think this is inviting us to look into the
facts of this case and decide whether this five-year
20

1

delay, particularly since the prosecution chose the 


2

death penalty -- you know, I don't like having to do 


3

that and -- but it seems, to me, that's what the 


4

question presented at least requires. 


5

MR. BOURKE:

Well, Your Honor, it -- I think

6

it would be open to this Court to answer the question by

7

saying the court got it wrong at the first step by

8

failing to attribute it to the State and then remand for

9

full consideration of weighing, in light of that.
What we have asked in our briefing for the

10
11

Court to do is to also provide some guidance on the

12

weight that should be given to delay resulting from the

13

lack of funding because in this case --

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we provide -- if we

15

provide that guidance, what do we do about the

16

continuances that Mr. Lorenzi requested that relate to

17

the funding?

18

continuance of funding hearing, citing scheduling

19

problems."

"January 10, 2003, Lorenzi requests a

20

"August 5, 2003, Lorenzi moves to continue

21

hearing on motion to designate source of funds so that

22

the Indigent Defender Board can consider funding Boyer's

23

case at an August 26 meeting."

24
25

So this is -- okay.

"Lorenzi moves to continue September 12,
2003.

Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion to
21

Alderson Reporting Company

1

designate funds in trial, so that the IDB may, again,

2

consider the funding defense at its next meeting.

3

December 15, Lorenzi moves to continue hearing on motion

4

to designate funds," et cetera.

5
6
7

There are many of these motions.

What do we

do with those?
MR. BOURKE:

Your Honor, I'd suggest that

8

this Court does exactly the same thing that the

9

Louisiana Court of Appeal did with them, which was to

10

find that it was the lack of funding, not any action by

11

Mr. Lorenzi, which caused the delay.

12

The -- the Louisiana Court of Appeal

13

declined to adopt the State's argument that it was Mr.

14

Lorenzi's fault.

15

the lack of a funding hearing caused no delay at all in

16

the conduct of this trial.

17

And the reason it did that was because

The funding hearing, when conducted,

18

produced no funding, no ruling or order, and had no

19

influence on the date of the trial.

20

right at issue was the right to go to trial, not to --

21

the timing of pretrial hearings.

22

And, of course, the

Furthermore, all of those continuances,

23

which were joined in by the State, were related to

24

trying to identify and find funding for this case and

25

for this man.

None of them were for a dilatory purpose.
22

Alderson Reporting Company

1

They were because a new procedure was

2

announced to submit bills in a different way to the IDB

3

because the Louisiana Supreme Court had accepted the

4

Citizen case.

5

And ultimately --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean, 


6

Justice Alito's problem seemed, to me, to get back to 


7

Justice Scalia's point, is that he seemed more 


8

interested in the funding than a speedy trial, the 


9

funding that would be provided by the State under its 


10
11

procedures.
MR. BOURKE:

In the absence of funding,

12

there was no trial to be had.

At the funding hearing --

13

or I'm sorry -- at the motion to quash hearing in

14

November 2006, there was a colloquy between the trial

15

court and the prosecutor in which the trial court said,

16

what are we going to do with this case?

17

a defense without money.

They can't have

18

This was not -- absolutely not --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And, as

20

Justice Alito pointed out on several occasions, what the

21

defense lawyer said was, let's put it off and see if we

22

can get funding, let's put it off until there's the

23

funding hearing, let's put it off and put it off, as

24

opposed to saying, I want a speedy trial, I'm entitled

25

to it now, if you don't have the money, I don't get a
23

2

speedy trial, I get off scot-free.
MR. BOURKE:

Well, under Louisiana's Article

3

701, there was no filing a motion for speedy trial,

4

saying, please give me a speedy trial, set a date now.

5

And at the same time --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Constitution requires

7

such a motion.

I mean, I don't care whether they have

8

a -- you know, a speedy trial motion.

9

him the right to speedy trial violates the Constitution,

10

surely, he is entitled to bring that to the attention of

11

the Louisiana court, whether there's a specific

12

statutory or rule provision or not.

13

MR. BOURKE:

If -- if denying

Your Honor, this Court, in

14

Barker, when dealing with this very topic under the

15

issue of assertion, specifically said it would allow

16

judges to take account of assertion in accordance with

17

local procedural requirements.

18

The local procedural requirement in a State

19

that already has its own statutory prescriptive period,

20

if you don't bring second-degree murder to trial within

21

two years, you're out.

22

The -- Louisiana does not need a defendant

23

to tell them that they have to bring a speedy trial, and

24

they don't want a defendant doing it, unless they're

25

ready to go to trial themselves.

They don't want the

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sort of pro forma assertion that was rejected.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, they -- they don't

been trying to get funding, and we're -- we're just sick

5

and tired of waiting for this.

7

don't get a speedy trial, we think there's a

9

24

there was the motion to quash.

25

And returning to your question -25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wasn't there

2

something about that motion was withdrawn -- the 2005

3

motion was withdrawn in 2006?

4

MR. BOURKE:

If -- if I can clarify that,

5

Justice Ginsburg, Mr. Lorenzi was at pains to say he was

6

not withdrawing the motion, but dismissing the motion to

7

quash because he couldn't advance it in a successful way

8

in Louisiana without demonstrating prejudice.

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Dismissing it, instead of

withdrawing it, that's the fine line he's drawing?

11

MR. BOURKE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that a line in Louisiana

law or something?

16

I don't know.

He specifically --

Does this -- this come from French
It seems, to me, withdrawing and

MR. BOURKE:

Well, the point, Your Honor,

trial, but, rather, dismissing his motion to quash on

So it was withdrawn, right?
MR. BOURKE:

No, it was dismissed.

He chose

dismiss, rather than withdraw is the word, and what he

24

intended by that was that he wasn't saying, I don't want

25

one; he was saying, I can't bring the type of hearing
26

1

Louisiana courts require to get my Sixth Amendment

2

motion to quash granted.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I think what you --

4

let's go back to that.

5

Louisiana law to assert his Sixth Amendment right, he

6

had to follow the procedure laid out in the Louisiana

7

rule?

8

MR. BOURKE:

9

had to do exactly that.

It was his view that, under

To move for a speedy trial, he

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

Sixth Amendment, he had to comply with the

12

requirements -- the procedural requirements of

13

Louisiana.

14
15

MR. BOURKE:

Under the

The local procedural

requirements for how one goes about doing that.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So then how

17

do you -- if he couldn't do it in 2002, '03, '04, or

18

'05, how did he end up doing it in '05?

19

MR. BOURKE:

The -- it's the difference

20

between moving for a speedy trial, please give me a

21

trial date, I want to go to trial next week, and moving

22

to quash because the speedy trial right has been

23

violated.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why didn't he move to

quash earlier?
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. BOURKE:

He moved to quash at the first

2

moment that it became available under the State statute,

3

which was at the three-year mark.

4

after that three-year mark, as soon as it became

5

available.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He moved one month

I'm sorry.

What -- is

7

there a law or a regulation in -- in Louisiana that

8

gives it a three-year mark?

9

MR. BOURKE:

Yes, Your Honor.

Article 579

10

and following provides that the State must bring a

11

first-degree murder charge to trial within three years,

12

or the case is prescribed, the indictment must be

13

dismissed with prejudice.

14

it had that deadline.

15

And so the State always knew

It didn't even set a trial date for a period

16

of over three years in the middle of this, didn't even

17

try to set a trial date for three-and-a-half years,

18

didn't bring Mr. Boyer into court for

19

three-and-a-half years to address his case at all.

20

And so, as soon as the remedy available

21

became open, as Judge Cook said in her opinion, defense

22

counsel filed using exactly the remedy provided for.

23

If there are no further questions, Your

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLA S. SIGLER

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MS. SIGLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

This Court should affirm the holding of the

7

Third Circuit Court of Appeals for three separate

8

reasons.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about the

10

reasoning -- is delay because of the lack of funding

11

attributable to the State or not?

12

attorney as agent of the State?

13

MS. SIGLER:

Or to the district

Justice Sotomayor, I don't

14

believe that the funding -- that we can credibly argue

15

that funding is completely outside the role of the

16

State.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's wrong with

18

what's been suggested by some, to remand to tell the

19

court below to whatever extent this was the basis of

20

your decision, it was wrong.

21

the factors.

22

MS. SIGLER:

Now, redo the Barker --

Well, Your Honor, if you review

23

the Third Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, which is at

24

Appendix D, the other Barker factors are analyzed,

25

incredibly thoroughly, with a mind to this Court's
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jurisprudence, and the rationale may be flawed with 


2

regard to that one point in this Court's opinion, but 


3

the result is not. 


4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So is one factor 


5

determinative always in this calculation?

6

was a weighing factor.

7

factor, why isn't that, in and of itself, a factor that

8

a court needs to weigh against the others?

9

MS. SIGLER:

I thought it

And so, if it's a weighing

I think that this Court has

10

always acknowledged, in its Barker v. Wingo

11

jurisprudence, that there is no one talismanic factor;

12

all of the factors are interrelated, and all are

13

reviewed.

14

with that one assessment of the Third Circuit's opinion,

15

the result is sound.

And that is why, even if the Court disagrees

16

With --

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but how do we know

18

that?

19

same determination if they had gotten it right on that

20

single factor?

21

How do we know that they would have reached the

MS. SIGLER:

I think, when you look at the

22

Third Circuit of Appeals opinion, they specifically --

23

and with direct quotations to Barker v. Wingo, go

24

through every other factor in the analysis.

25

discuss the fact of the repeated continuances of defense

is a --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Whether something is --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

Whether something is the

8

State's fault is a significant factor in the analysis,

9

and we have made that very clear in our cases.

And so,

10

if they got that wrong -- and -- and you, I think, quite

11

rightly, are saying we can't defend that part of it --

12

if they got that wrong, don't we at least have to say,

13

okay, well, get it right now, and do it again?

14

MS. SIGLER:

Well, Justice Kagan, I don't

15

think that what I would say is they got it completely

16

wrong because, as this Court has acknowledged throughout

17

its Barker jurisprudence, there are different weights

18

you attribute to government action, whether it is

19

negligence or whether it is a deliberate attempt on

20

behalf of the State to evade giving a defendant his

21

Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I would like to get

23

the structure of your argument.

You began to say

24

there's three reasons.

25

three reasons, so that I can understand the framework

I would just like to hear those

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for all these questions.

2

MS. SIGLER:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4
5

Yes, sir, Justice Kennedy.
The three reasons that we

should affirm.
MS. SIGLER:

The first reason is that, as in

6

Vermont v. Brillon, the delay occasioned in this case

7

was due to Petitioner's counsel's repeated requests to

8

continue his own funding motion, which delayed a source

9

of funding when he -- the Petitioner wished to proceed

10

with capital-certified counsel.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MS. SIGLER:

Okay.

And the second?

The second reason, Your Honor,

13

would be, pursuant to Loud Hawk, even if this Court

14

determines that there was a negligence factor with

15

regard to the State of Louisiana in not properly funding

16

capital-certified counsel, there are valid public policy

17

interests at play here and the fact that Louisiana is

18

generous enough to provide specially-certified counsel

19

to capital indigent defendants, when there is no

20

constitutional requirement for it to do so.

21

And then our third argument, Your Honor,

22

would be that, based under the Barker v. Wingo

23

jurisprudence, the delay should not be attributed to the

24

State in this case because of Petitioner's failure to

25

meaningfully assert his right to a speedy trial.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MS. SIGLER:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Okay.

Thank you.

Yes, sir.
How -- on that, how could

4

it possibly be Lorenzi's fault, which is what you said

5

is your first point, when he said, pay me, Supreme Court

6

of Louisiana, you have said that my operation as counsel

7

for this indigent defendant doesn't become operative

8

till I get paid, I have a right to get paid.

9

All that counsel did was to say, again and

10

again, pay me, get the funds to pay me.

11

understand how in the world it could be the fault of an

12

attorney who has not gotten one cent from the State, has

13

a right to be paid before he engages in

14

representation -- how can it be his fault?
MS. SIGLER:

15

I don't

Well, Justice Ginsburg, there

16

are several reasons why it's Mr. Lorenzi's fault.

17

first of which is he filed a motion under

18

State v. Wigley, and that is Appendix X of your Joint

19

Appendix.

20

The

In that motion, he identified

21

State v. Wigley, and, although he referenced wanting

22

expert resources as well, he primarily based that motion

23

on his entitlement to attorney's fees.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
that question.

I -- I was going to ask you

Opposing counsel said that it -- it
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

wasn't primarily attorney's fees that's at issue here,

2

but investigation costs.

3

because, if it's just attorney's fees, he could have

4

gone ahead with one attorney, as far as I'm concerned.

5

MS. SIGLER:

That makes a difference to me

I agree with you,

6

Justice Scalia.

7

is the hearing on the motion to quash, Mr. Lorenzi says,

8

point blank -- in that appendix, he says, "I was not

9

going to proceed to file substantive motions until I was

10

And, if you look at Appendix LL, which

funded."

11

And --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Doesn't he say, at the

13

same time, I couldn't do the investigation to make the

14

motion required by the State?

15

the funding for investigation?

16

MS. SIGLER:

So didn't that implicate

Well, Justice Sotomayor, if you

17

look at Appendix LL, where Mr. Lorenzi is speaking, he

18

says, "I have done substantial investigation on my own."

20

LCAC, with Ms. Christine Lehmann assisting him as

21

associate counsel.

Were there funds for

investigation?
MS. SIGLER:

There were funds available in

2003 that Mr. Lorenzi did not avail himself of because

funds?

There were -- there was a

capital defense account that was held by the Calcasieu

8

pages 193 to 194.

Mr. Lorenzi identified

He says, in a letter to Judge David Painter,

10

then the presiding trial judge, that he has identified a

source of funds for his representation.

13

at that time, scheduled for the next month.

24

in -- in that particular phrase that you are speaking of

25

has to do with our response to how the Petitioner has
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

phrased this issue all along.

2

continuously phrased this issue as if he had a right to

3

capital-certified counsel, and, in fact, in his reply

4

brief, that is what he states.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Petitioner has

I thought -- I thought the

6

statement meant could not ethically or legally bring him

7

to trial while he is insisting on his right to two

8

counsel.

9

MS. SIGLER:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

It would have been

11

different if he had said, the devil with the second

12

counsel, I want a -- I want a prompt trial.

13

MS. SIGLER:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

That's correct.
Then you would have felt

that, legally and ethically, you could proceed.

16

MS. SIGLER:

Yes, sir.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.
What about your

18

friend's argument that he couldn't ask for a speedy

19

trial without an affidavit saying he was ready to go to

20

trial?

21

MS. SIGLER:

It's interesting that

22

Petitioner argued that here today because, under Article

23

71 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, while an affidavit

24

is listed in the statute as one requirement, as a matter

25

of course, motions for speedy trial are granted pro se
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all the time that meet none of the requirements in that

2

statute.

3

In addition, Rule 31 does not say that a

4

defendant who is trying to avail himself of Rule 31

5

can't file a motion for a speedy trial.

6

to that effect.

In fact, that was refuted by

In fact, the results that was given from an

What was the level of his

MS. SIGLER:

I believe his level of

education was eighth grade.

But I would --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And he was expected to

know all this about two counsel -- you have a right to

Did anyone ever tell this man, with an
eighth grade education, what his rights were?
MS. SIGLER:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't

believe that that specific discussion was ever had -JUSTICE SCALIA:

His -- his one counsel

might have known.
MS. SIGLER:

His one --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He did have one counsel.

11

He had one counsel because he only graduated from the

12

eighth grade.

13

counsel could have known, no?

14

That's why we provide counsel.

MS. SIGLER:

Absolutely.

And that

In fact,

15

Mr. Lorenzi was well aware of the fact that he could

16

have chosen -- the Petitioner could have chosen to

17

proceed with just one counsel.

18

But I'd also like to note, Justice Scalia,

19

that, from 2002 to 2004, he had three counsel.

He had

20

Mr. Lorenzi, he had Mr. Steven Singer, and he had

21

Ms. Christine Lehman.

22

He didn't just have one; he had three.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And she was not -- you

24

know, you said that, at all times, he had at least two.

25

It seemed to me -- two paid counsel.
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Lorenzi wasn't

Official

1

paid, so it was -- was it Singer?

2

MS. SIGLER:

Yes, ma'am.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then the woman --

4

Lehman, is it?

5

she didn't have the qualifications to be counsel.

6

But, when she started representing him,

MS. SIGLER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, as has

7

been alluded to before, I believe, by Justice Scalia,

8

she absolutely had the qualifications to serve as

9

counsel, as required by the Sixth Amendment.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And --

But she wouldn't -- she

11

couldn't be appointed counsel in a death case under

12

Louisiana's rules.

13

MS. SIGLER:

She met the qualifications for

14

associate counsel.

15

a motion filed by Mr. Lorenzi to be associate counsel --

16
17
18

In fact, she was later certified in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but, in the very

beginning, she wasn't even qualified to do that.
MS. SIGLER:

Well, there was a provision --

19

there is a provision in Louisiana law -- law that allows

20

someone to move for the admission and the certification

21

of somebody as capital counsel, which was the procedure

22

employed in this case.

23

That is perfectly permissible.

But Miss Lehman, at that time, was a very

24

experienced attorney, and we lay out her qualifications

25

in the brief.

So, while she may not have been perfectly
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

qualified under Rule 31 to serve as lead counsel, she

2

certainly was more than qualified --

Justice Thomas.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

anybody who's graduated from Harvard and Yale?

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it

Or even just passed the

2

MS. SIGLER:

Or LSU law.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I went to Harvard.

I would think -- no, no,

4

no.

This is a very serious question which is, I don't

5

know that we have ever defined what the minimum

6

qualification is for qualified counsel.

7

But it is -- some of it has to be that

8

counsel themselves feel adequate to represent a capital

9

defendant.

10

MS. SIGLER:

Well --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know plenty of lawyers

12

who would never either volunteer or would resist being

13

appointed to take on that kind of case because it has

14

many differences to a normal case.

15

MS. SIGLER:

I would agree with that,

16

Justice Sotomayor, but I would invite you to look at the

17

motion that moved for the certification of Ms. Lehman,

18

which is in the record.

worked on other capital cases in advisory positions.

she --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

So

Let me -- let me give you a

4

holding -- this is an incredibly factually complicated

5

case.

6

fact-bound, but we've taken it.

We don't usually take cases that are so

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

we might adopt.

Let me give you a rule that

If the failure to provide funding makes

10

it impossible for some period of time for a case to be

11

tried, then the delay is attributable to the State.

12

Would you agree with that?

13

MS. SIGLER:

If the failure to provide

14

funding is a deliberate attempt on the State to

15

interfere with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel,

16

then I would agree with that.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

You also agree, right on

18

this subject, that the only sentence that I can find --

19

I haven't read it totally carefully -- but, in the lower

20

court opinion, that has to do with this is the sentence

21

I read before.

22

And it says, "The first three years he was

23

incarcerated, he was charged with first-degree murder,

24

and the progression of the prosecution was out of the

25

State's control, as determined by this Court and the
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Supreme Court."

2

Now, when I look at those words, I am not

3

100 percent certain what they mean.

4

helpful -- but I don't want --- you're not going to do

5

it -- I'd like to -- are you -- would you concede that

6

that statement means they're saying that the State, for

7

speedy trial purposes, is not to be held accountable,

8

really, at all, for not providing the money, insofar as

9

that's a cause of the delay?
Is that a conceded point?

10

So it would be

Or is that

11

something I have to spend quite a lot of time going

12

through?

13

And, if you don't concede that, what is it

14

that you concede, which would spare a little time going

15

through this record.

16
17

MS. SIGLER:

Justice Breyer, I regret to

inform you that I do not concede that point.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MS. SIGLER:

20

I believe that if you look at

the --

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

All right.

I thought maybe you would

not, but --

24

(Laughter.)

25

MS. SIGLER:

I believe that, if you look at

Appendix D, as I stated earlier, the other Barker

2

factors are discussed.

were filed by defense counsel are mentioned with regard

4

to the assertion of the right; they are not necessarily

5

mentioned with regard to the State.

6

And the continuance motions that

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, you are right.

Most

7

of this opinion -- and almost all of it is about the

8

other factors.

9

looked like.

10

Now, I agree with you, that's what it
But we do have this sentence.

So how am I supposed to figure out whether

11

that sentence really means what they say?

12

something they threw in to make the opinion more

13

difficult for us to understand?

14

MS. SIGLER:

Or just is

I don't think that was the

15

stated -- the -- the intention of the Third Circuit,

16

Justice Breyer.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I don't either.

18

don't either.

19

it has something to do with funding.

20

argument it doesn't?

I

But what's the argument -- sounds as if

21

MS. SIGLER:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what's the

Well, I believe -I mean, it says, you see,

23

"as determined by this Court and the Supreme Court."

24

What were they talking about?

25

MS. SIGLER:

Well, I believe what the Third
46


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Circuit was referring to was this Court's

2

Barker v. Wingo jurisprudence.

3

repeatedly, that even if something --

4
5

JUSTICE BREYER:
that's it.

This Court has stated,

Oh, okay.

They're referring to Barker.

Well, then,
Okay.

6

So when they say it's out of this State's

7

control, as referred to in Barker, which is our case,

8

then what they mean is that it's not something that the

9

State had anything to do with, so they shouldn't be

10
11

blamed for it.
MS. SIGLER:

I think that they are

12

attempting, in some fashion, to reconcile some of this

13

Court's later statements in the Barker jurisprudence,

14

which this Court made it clear, in Vermont v. Brillon,

15

that certain actions are not going to be attributed to

16

the State for speedy trial purposes --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

MS. SIGLER:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23
24
25

Ms. Sigler, could you go

back to Justice Alito's question?

20

22

When you agreed with --

I'm sorry?
That was a good -- that was

a good segue.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You added the word

"deliberate" -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Justice Alito, I

Official

1

think, has a question pending.

2

MS. SIGLER:

Okay.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you agreed with the --

4

the principle that I mentioned, except that you want to

5

draw a distinction between the failure to provide

6

funding and the deliberate failure to provide funding?

7

Is that a real difference?

8

MS. SIGLER:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

failed to provide funding?

11

MS. SIGLER:

Absolutely.
Can the State inadvertently

I think that this Court has

12

always recognized, in the Barker jurisprudence, that

13

negligence is a very different factor in how it weighs

14

against a State than a deliberate attempt to violate a

15

constitutional right to a speedy trial.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How can --

When we said in Krillon

18

delays resulting from a systemic breakdown in the public

19

defender system could be charged to the State, so that

20

suggests systemic breakdown doesn't necessarily mean

21

deliberate.

22

and the result is that the person can't get to trial.

23

It just means there has been a breakdown,

And if -- I think -- if Justice Alito could

24

even read that again and if you think about it, in light

25

of this statement in Krillon, that systemic breakdowns
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are systemic breakdowns, whether or not they are

2

deliberate.

3

MS. SIGLER:

Well, Justice Kagan, I think

4

that the best evidence or the fact that there was no

5

systemic breakdown is the funding hearing itself,

6

Appendix JJ.

7

At that funding hearing, there are extensive

8

discussions about other capital cases within the State

9

that are being tried the entire time this case is

10

pending, including one case that we referred to,

11

State v. Reeves, in Calcasieu Parish, a capital case

12

that went to trial in less than four years, that

13

included a retrial.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let's say you have a

15

case where the -- the defendant wants counsel, can't

16

afford counsel, and the State says, we'd love to provide

17

counsel for you, but we're broke, we just don't have any

18

money to provide counsel, but, maybe in a year, we'll

19

have money to provide counsel.

20

Now, what do we do with the delay between

21

that point and -- and the -- the point, a year later,

22

when the money becomes available?

23

MS. SIGLER:

Well, I think, from that

24

scenario, we would have to look at the State's

25

intention.

I certainly think that, if the State flat
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

out said, I'm sorry, you're not getting counsel for a

2

year, then we would have to attribute that factor to the

3

State more heavily, even though it does appear that, in

4

your scenario, it's more of a negligence problem than a

5

deliberate we're not going to fund you problem.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose it is negligent.

7

For -- for a year, this person isn't represented because

8

the State keeps sending the checks to his cousin of the

9

same name.

I mean -- you know, they didn't do it

10

purposely.

He just happens to have a cousin, this

11

lawyer, of the same name, who doesn't tell him he's

12

getting these checks out of nowhere.

13

So he can't hire the expert.

14

negligence.

15

State?

Absolute

I mean, that's not to be attributed to the

16

MS. SIGLER:

No, Justice Breyer.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Clearly --

Is there any authority for

18

that?

19

because it wasn't deliberate, but no attribution

20

whatsoever?

21

I mean -- you know, maybe you'd discount it

MS. SIGLER:

Well, you discount it,

22

Justice Breyer, and you attribute it to more of a

23

negligence standard than you would a -- an absolute

24

failure or refusal to provide counsel.

25

has done that repeatedly.
50

Alderson Reporting Company

And this Court

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

What's the

2

difference between saying, I'm broke, and I want to pay

3

the prosecutor because they kept paying the prosecutor,

4

I want to pay for the prosecutor's investigation, but I

5

won't pay you?

6

applying the negligence versus deliberate standard?

7

What -- what is the difference in

I mean, look, in the end, States are always

8

strapped, but I don't know a State who doesn't make some

9

income.

They make a choice about where they want that

10

income to go.

And it may be, in your judgment, a more

11

legitimate decision, but why is the situation less

12

negligent -- why is it negligent and not deliberate?

13

Why is the choice one, not the other?

14

MS. SIGLER:

Because, Justice Sotomayor, I

15

believe in this Court's decisions, under

16

Barker v. Wingo, the choice aspect -- the deliberate

17

intent aspect has been looked at by the courts in

18

deciding how much of the blame is to be assessed against

19

the State.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

Well, then answer the

21

question.

Why isn't the choice to say, I -- I'm broke,

22

so I don't want to pay you, I'm going to pay the

23

prosecutor -- which happened, the prosecutors were being

24

paid throughout.

25

but we're choosing not to pay the defendants.

They had enough money to investigate,

51

Well, Justice Sotomayor, that

choice was not made in this case.

There were available funds in

I was referring to that letter in the record

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

The -- the court itself

11

said, repeatedly, that the cause of the delay was the

12

funding crisis, the court -- I think we have to accept

13

that as being the case, that the funding crisis -- the

14

effort to get this lawyer paid failed, time and again.

15

And it was the court determination that it is the

16

funding crisis that caused the delay.

17

MS. SIGLER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

18

funding crisis that the court ruled on was present in

19

2006.

20

started.

21

funds -- funds to pay him.

22

It was not present in 2003, when this case
Mr. Lorenzi, himself, identified a source of

And when we hear Chief Public Defender Ron

23

Ware testify at that motion for funding hearing, at

24

Appendix JJ, he says, yes, I have a special capital

25

defense account, and, yes, I have been paying capital
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

attorneys from this account throughout this time period.
The fact that there weren't funds readily

3

available in 2006 is directly attributable to Petitioner's

4

counsels failing to move his funding herein forward in

5

2003, when he first identified that source of funds.

6

This is not a case in which there was never any funding.

7

This was a case in which defense counsel,

8

for whatever reason, delayed a resolution of the funding

9

issue, an issue that he, himself, identified as one --

10

without any resolution, he was not going to go forward

11

with substantive motions.

12

The onus -- the -- the blame -- or more of

13

the blame in this case, on the funding problem, belongs

14

with the Petitioner, not the State of Louisiana, whether

15

we mean the prosecution --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not going to argue

17

the funding issue because I've got to go look at the

18

record again.

19

But let's assume that the record doesn't

20

support your claim because, as I read the decisions

21

below and the record that I saw, there wasn't funding

22

available until -- I think it was 2006 or '7?

23

somehow, there's a disconnect between what you're saying

24

and the record.

25

And so,

But let's assume that -- my hypothetical,
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that there wasn't money, despite whatever you're saying.

2
3

What's your position then?
deliberate?

4

Then it's not

It's still negligence.
MS. SIGLER:

Justice Sotomayor, I maintain

5

that position, and I believe it to be consistent with

6

this Court's repeated analysis under Barker v. Wingo

7

jurisprudence.

8

You do look at the intent of the State as

9

either a negligence factor, akin to more of a neutral

10

factor, a deliberate factor, or a valid reason for the

11

delay.

And I would also suggest to Your Honor --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So there could never be

13

a systematic breakdown, in your judgment, because any

14

time the State gives resources to something else, it's

15

not deliberate -- it's not a systemic breakdown.

Justice Sotomayor, I would

54

Alderson Reporting Company

amount prosecutors are awarded by the State.

2

I would, again, suggest that this is not a

3

case of systemic breakdown.

And I think that, as a

4

policy matter, this Court should be reluctant to rule

5

against the State of Louisiana, which, as Justice Scalia

6

noted, has been so generous in trying to provide capital

7

indigent defendants with specially qualified counsel,

8

which is more counsel than they're even entitled to

9

under the Sixth Amendment.
And I would also urge this Court to be

10
11

cognizant of its own repeated statements in the past,

12

that this is a very severe remedy with regard to letting

13

a convicted murderer free.

14

I'd also like to address, before I sit down

15

and turn this back over to Mr. Bourke, Justice Ginsburg,

16

earlier, you had addressed the question of whether or

17

not the armed robbery was, in fact, still a valid

18

charge.

19

Contrary to Mr. Bourke's assertion before

20

Your Honor today, if you look at Appendix 254A, there is

21

a writ of opposition that was filed by the Petitioner

22

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD BOURKE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. BOURKE:

Thank you.

And I have a few

12

points of clarification that I want to make, just in a

13

very quick fashion.

14

Justice Sotomayor, there was no funding in

15

2001, 2002, 2003.

It was never there.

If Your Honor

16

looks at the Louisiana Supreme Court opinion in Citizen,

17

it will describe the Turner case funding hearing in

18

2001.

19

There was no money.

Mr. Lorenzi was stuck with that one as well.

20

Mr. Lorenzi did, indeed, submit bills in

21

2003 because a new procedure had been announced, and

22

that's at page -- Joint Appendix page 401 to '3.

23

see the correspondence showing he did submit bills, and

24

there was no money.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There was money

2

by the State -- the funding was grossly inadequate to

3

cover all the needs?

MR. BOURKE:
underwater.

6

Right.

It was -- it was

It was oversubscribed.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It --

Mr. Bourke, would you

7

respond to the last point made by -- by opposing

8

counsel?

9
10

MR. BOURKE:

Yes, certainly.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You did state -- it's in

11

Appendix J -- "Even if the murder indictment were

12

quashed, Mr. Boyer faces the armed robbery prosecution."

13

MR. BOURKE:

Yes, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You told us, today, that

15

that's not the case, that the armed robbery prosecution

16

goes down the drain.

17

Which -- which is true?

MR. BOURKE:

The passage you're referring to

18

is from a writ application purely limited to the

19

application of the State speedy trial statute, which

20

does accord a new clock to every new filing.

21

So, under Louisiana State statutory law, the

22

armed robbery started the State statutory clock again,

23

but that is not the case for the Sixth Amendment --

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

As to the murder or as

to the independent robbery count?
57

Alderson Reporting Company

It's not a lesser

Official

included offense, the robbery count.

2

MR. BOURKE:

The armed robbery was a lesser

3

included of first-degree murder, but it is not a lesser

4

included of second-degree murder.

5

argument was the same force was applied in both, the

6

force for the murder and the force for the armed

7

robbery, so that's completely irrelevant.

8
9

Our double jeopardy

But that was a State statutory argument
about the armed robbery charge, which has no

10

application in the case in front of us.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Boyer -- why would -Go ahead.

Why would we get to that

14

question?

15

It has been briefed to us in a grand total of two

16

paragraphs, I think.

18
19

I mean, no courts below have dealt with it.

There would be no reason for us to

MR. BOURKE:

It -- it is well beyond the

question presented, Your Honor, I agree.

20

Your Honor, the --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so -- so, from that

22

point of view, we can assume that there is a robbery

23

conviction that is still out there.

24

MR. BOURKE:

He has a murder and armed

robbery conviction from the same incident.

right?
MR. BOURKE:

That -- that is why this Court

6

would remand to allow the -- the local court to deal

7

with it and ensure that that's accurate.

8
9

Justice Breyer, the reference to our
earlier -- the decision of this Court and the supreme

10

court is a reference to the earlier decision on the

11

interlocutory writ application, the earlier decision

12

that a lack of adequate funds prevented the prosecution.

13

And if Your Honor looks at Joint Appendix,

14

at page 126, which is part of the opinion of the Third

15

Circuit, you will see, earlier, in their opinion, they

16

discuss their own earlier ruling in the supreme court --
