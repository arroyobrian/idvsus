ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN MAHONEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

If this Court adheres to its State action

12

ruling, it should now hold that the TSSAA has broad

13

discretion to adopt and to enforcement contractual

14

restrictions on athletic recruiting as a condition of

15

membership.

16

escape the contractual bargain it's made under the First

17

Amendment, because the association offered it a

18

reasonable choice as measured by the three criteria that

19

this Court has used to identify unconstitutional

20

conditions.

21

Under this Court's cases, Brentwood cannot

First, participation in the state

22

tournaments is entirely voluntary.

Second, the

23

restrictions at issue here are germane to the legitimate

24

goals of the association.

25

rule here imposed only a minimal burden on speech of

And third, enforcement of the

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

private concerns.
I would like to turn first to the issue of

3

voluntariness, because that's a core issue in every case

4

involving allegedly unconstitutional conditions.

5
6
7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you a

preliminary question, Ms. Mahoney?
And that is, we are told that at the time

8

this issue arose, the practice itself was all right, and

9

it was all right for one school to invite students from

10

another school to join the invitee school's practice.

11

And now I take it that it's no longer permissible, that

12

one school's, one school's practice, is reserved for its

13

own students and not -- others are not invited.

14

it was permissible under the association's rules to

15

invite students from other schools, then why is it

16

impermissible to talk it up?

17

you can't talk about it?

18

MS. MAHONEY:

But if

I mean, you can do it, but

Your Honor, actually the

19

record indicates that it would be permissible to give

20

the information about the date for the spring practice

21

to the students who had signed an enrollment contract.

22

And that's at CAJA-705.

23

enrollment packet, for instance.

24

sent just as a schedule.

25

It could have been sent in an
It could have been

But instead the problem here was that it was
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sent from the coach in a personal solicitation to the

2

students that really subtly pressured them to come to

3

practice.

4

question 3, which is the interpretive guidance for the

5

recruiting rule, it very expressly says that

6

coach-initiated contact with students who are enrolled

7

at another school is not supposed to occur.

8

fell within the terms of the rule.

9

said, it would strain credulity to say that Brentwood

This was a form of recruiting.

Under

And so this

As the Sixth Circuit

10

didn't know that it shouldn't have sent this letter.

11

And their own headmaster acknowledged that it certainly

12

should have been t kind of thing that they would have

13

called about before doing it, and he was surprised that

14

Coach Flatt had not done so.

15

So I think, Your Honor, that the first point

16

is that, yes, this information could have been

17

communicated to the students, but not in this way.

18

certainly the association could recognize that this was

19

still a form of recruiting.

20
21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

So in speech terms, there

were alternative means to get the message out.

MS. MAHONEY:

practice.

25

information could be communicated.

This was speech

It was about the time for football

And there were other ways that that

5

Alderson Reporting Company

But the association

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has an interest in having prophylactic rules that

2

prevent coaches from initiating communications with

3

students before they started school, because even though

4

they -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think the briefs are -

6

I think it's fair to characterize the Respondent's brief

7

this way, or fair to concentrate on Pickering.

8

to me that Pickering is the key here, and I took away

9

that impression from your brief.

10

It seems

If we said that it's commercial speech, I

11

think that's a little far off the mark.

12

an unconstitutional condition, I'm not sure that helps

13

either side that much, either.

14

MS. MAHONEY:

If we said it's

Your Honor, I think Pickering

15

is really an example of an unconstitutional conditions

16

analysis just in the employment context.

17

really says in a broad group of cases where the

18

government or the State actor is not exercising

19

sovereign power, if it's offering a benefit, if it's

20

using funding to encourage activity, if it is engaging

21

in a contractual relationship as it does in Umbehr, that

22

what this court has said in Umbehr very explicitly is

23

that when the government uses contractual power the

24

constitutional concerns are not as great.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What the Court

In Umbehr we said, the

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court said, that in the independent contractor cases the

2

interests of either party, the government or the

3

contractor, are not quite so intense as they are with a

4

public employee.

5

it.

6

I thought that made sense when I read

I'm not so sure it does any more.
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, and in fact this Court

7

said in Umbehr that, even though the interests were what

8

different, the standards that had been applied in

9

Connick and Pickering could easily accommodate the

10
11

circumstances of dealing with JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I suppose we could

12

construct a hypothetical where we could say there's a

13

very strong interest in the contractor.

14

that that works as a general theorem.

15

MS. MAHONEY:

So I'm not sure

But I think that the key from

16

all the cases, whether we look at Cornelius, which

17

involves your access to the charitable campaign, or if

18

we look at or if we look at Lusk and American Library,

19

which involved access to funding, or Grove, access to

20

funding, that the strain across these cases is that

21

you're really looking at is the restriction germane.

22

What kind of a burden -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about if, what

24

if the association had a rule that members, school

25

officials, shall not criticize the decisions of the
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

association?

2

MS. MAHONEY:

I think then it would be -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's germane.

In

4

other words, you can criticize other things, but if

5

you're going to join this group we think it's important

6

for their public stature not to be criticized by

7

members.

8
9
10

MS. MAHONEY:

I think that would probably be

viewed as speech of public concern, and at that point
under Connick balancing you'd have -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

public concern about when spring practice is.

13

think there should be, you know, two playoff tiers

14

rather than three and you criticize the association for

15

that and they say well, you're suspended for a year and

16

all that.

17

MS. MAHONEY:

There's no more
If you

Your Honor, in Connick this

18

Court said that in assessing whether something is a

19

issue of public concern you look at not just the topic,

20

but also the way in which that topic is discussed.

21

if what happened was the association decided that it was

22

going to penalize a member or have a broad rule that

23

says it would tolerate no criticism and even if

24

Brentwood had taken an ad out in the paper to talk about

25

how terrible the association's policies were, I think
8

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this Court could readily find that that was not a

2

reasonable choice because it would impact -

3
4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about

criticizing officials?

5

MS. MAHONEY:

On the field, Your Honor?

I

6

think that the interests in essentially controlling that

7

kind of speech would always outweigh the interests of an

8

athlete or a coach in engaging in any kind of speech on

9

the field.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I mean three

11

days later, you know, the school -- the coach writes an

12

editorial saying there were lousy calls in the game last

13

week.

14

MS. MAHONEY:

I think that would probably be

15

treated as speech of public concern, which would then

16

give rise to Connick balancing.

17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
it?

19
20

MS. MAHONEY:

23

What Connick says is you look

at how core is the speech, what's it about?

21
22

And how would you balance

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And how would you

commence?
MS. MAHONEY:

Probably find that that not be

24

a reasonable restriction, that it's probably not germane

25

to the important educational goals of the association.

Alderson Reporting Company

But it could -- I mean, I think that what we have here

2

is the recruiting rule has been applied to speech that's

3

a private concern that can be delivered in another way;

4

and the choice to join is entirely voluntary.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Ms. Mahoney, on that point,

6

can I just take you back to square one for a second?

7

I'm with you in your explanation that the speech at

8

issue here probably was fairly understood as being for,

9

you know, the communication here as being a violation of

10

the rule.

11

been -- I guess I have two questions.

12

Could you, though, tell me, would it have

Would it have been a violation of the rule

13

if the coach had sent the letter to eighth grade

14

students in the school itself, those who were already

15

formally enrolled and who might be going out for

16

football the next fall?

17

the interest in preventing recruiting, as you describe

18

it, when the letters are aimed at people who have

19

already signed, I think you referred to it as, an

20

enrollment contract?

21

they're going to be in that school next year.

22

What is the interest?

And number two, what is exactly

So there's every reason to believe

And would that

23

interest have supported a ban on letters to the already

24

enrolled eighth grade kids?

MS. MAHONEY:

First, I think that this
10

Alderson Reporting Company

letter, which was not sent to Brentwood's own eighth

2

grade middle school students, probably could have been,

3

because under the rule those students were not enrolled

at another school.

coach-initiated contact with students enrolled at

6

another school.

And what is really restricted is

This letter was instead sent to student

Your Honor, the contracts

the record demonstrates that some student do sign

17

multiple contracts.

18

efforts to get, of the coach, to get them to come to

19

practice, to be with him, to entice them, to give them

20

his personal home phone number, that's still a form of

21

recruiting.

22

We have the contracts in the record at

But more importantly, whether it was or not,

Some students do not come.

And yet he was exactly the kind of person that still

2

could have been subject to recruiting if during that

3

period -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So it boils down to saying

5

that when they've signed the enrollment contract that's

6

not the end of the, in effect, the issue.

7

MS. MAHONEY:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9
10

No.
And there is a sensible

practical way in which recruiting goes on even among
those who have signed up.

11

MS. MAHONEY:

Okay.
It certainly could, and so

12

there's an interest in stopping that.

13

certainly has said that even in the commercial speech

14

area, in Ohralik instance, that it's fineto have

15

prophylactic rules as long as the rule continues to

16

advance the interest.

less strong at the point when they sign an enrollment

contract doesn't mean there is still no legitimate

activity in the State of Tennessee, and they have

MS. MAHONEY:

there were five violations, five penalties for

violations of the recruiting rule, and four of them were

undisputed, but the record certainly establishes, that

academic targeting is not prohibited -- that's in the

other school wants to initiate contact for the purpose

one thing I do want to make clear about the

voluntariness of the choice and then I'll turn to due

2

process, is that, as we set out in our brief, one of the

things that Brentwood and some of its amici have tried

to say is that there simply is no ability to play

scholastic sports in Tennessee if you're not a member of

this association.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. HIMMELFARB:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The position of the United States is that

6

the court of appeals applied the wrong standard in

7

deciding Brentwood's First Amendment claim.

8

Court's decisions establish that when the government

9

offers a benefit that a citizen is free to reject, it

This

10

has much greater leeway in regulating speech than when

11

it exercises its coercive sovereign power.

12

where the Government acts as an employer, a contractor,

13

a property owner, a service provider or a benefactor,

14

the TSSAA offers a benefit, access to organized athletic

15

competition, that a school may decline by choosing not

16

to become a member of the association.

17

As in cases

Brentwood's First Amendment challenge to

18

the TSSAA recruiting rule, therefore, is subject to

19

deferential review.

20

is appropriate in these contexts because the Government

21

occupies a middle ground when it is not exercising its

22

sovereign authority.

23

remains the Government no matter what authority it's

24

exercising -- so it is subject to the restrictions of

25

the First Amendment.

Deferential First Amendment review

On the one hand the Government

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

On the other hand, when the Government acts

2

in a non-sovereign capacity, its position is comparable

3

to that of private sector entities and it has to be able

4

to make the same sorts of decisions that they make.

5

has to be able to decide what conduct is acceptable in

6

its workplace, what activities may take place on its

7

property, and the uses to which its grant money may be

can't use offensive language in dealing with opposing

players or referees, as indeed the TSSAA bylaws in fact

do.

that prohibition should not be subject to heightened

deferential standard of review is easily satisfied.

2

Prohibiting the use of undue influence in recruiting or

3

attempting to secure or retain high school athletes we

think is self-evidently reasonable in light of the

5

purposes underlying the rule, which include preventing

6

the exploitation of children and ensuring that sports

Prohibiting coaches from contacting students

I'm sorry; you think

it might be a reasonable or unreasonable?

6

MR. HIMMELFARB:

It might be -- well, I

7

think it's close enough to the line that it could go

8

either way.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a close call

10

whether a school can send a brochure to 8th graders that

11

is not limited to athletics telling them about their

12

school?

13

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, the -- in that

14

situation, I think -- I think it probably would be

15

unreasonable, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

The, the -- the methods of -- the

17

alternative methods of speech here are not all that

18

different -- that are allowed by the rule here -- are

19

not all that different from Justice Stevens'

20

hypothetical.

21

schools can communicate with prospective students and

22

their families about athletics at the school, but it's

23

usually done through intermediaries.

24

say, Justice Stevens' hypothetical is not -

25

There are a number of ways in which

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

unreasonable for the TSSAA to prohibit that?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

I think that would be much

more problematic.

12

this rule prohibits that.

prohibits Justice Stevens' example.

14

Is that all right?

And I don't -- I don't think that

What the rule allows is for schools to send

15

out information about their athletic programs to other

16

schools to distribute to their students, for example.

17

It also allows them to send it out to real estate

18

brokers, to athletic leagues that aren't associated with

It allows it to respond to

But I think Justice Stevens' hypothetical

and your hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, are pretty

close to the sorts of things that are allowed by this

recruiting rule.

that if the, if the -- if the recruiting rule -- if

5

there were a recruiting rule that prohibited those types

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You do agree at some point

the First Amendment would prohibit some kind of rule.

think there is a reasonableness or germaneness

The justifications for the rule are mainly

Is that permissible, in

weighing the -- both sides of the equation to consider

the advantages -- I mean the justifications for the

17

speech?

18

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Sure.

Under -- under a

19

reasonableness standard, I think it is appropriate to

20

look at the justifications for the rule and ask whether

21

if the -- the rule reasonably furthers those interests.

22

And, and in making that determination -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- justification for the

24

rule in this case and the justification for the rule

25

that would prohibit the general solicitation I
23

described.

2

MR. HIMMELFARB:

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm sorry?
Is it the same

4

justification, but the justification is a little

5

stronger in one hypo than the other?

6

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Right.

I think you, if you

7

-- if you offered those justifications for banning the

8

type of speech you suggested, it might very well be that

9

it would be appropriate to conclude that the rule isn't

10

reasonably related to those justifications because it

11

burdens too much speech.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that,

13

turning to the state action for a moment, one of the

14

justifications for finding state action that is there is

15

no other real choice, that they have, other than to -

16

if they want to play athletics in Tennessee other than

17

to join this association.

18

And yet at the opening of your argument, you

19

said oh, well it's voluntary.

20

your speech argument is inconsistent with one of the

21

justifications for finding state action to begin with.

22

MR. HIMMELFARB:

So It seems to me that

Well, no, I don't think so,

23

Justice Kennedy.

In the types of cases that I mentioned

24

at the outset, employment cases, funding cases,

25

property, ownership cases, I mean there's no dispute
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that in those cases the Government is a state actor.

2

When the Government employs people it is a state actor

3

subject to the First Amendment, but deferential review

4

is applied to First Amendment challenges because there

5

is a choice.

6

And so too here there is a choice for the

7

reasons mentioned by Ms. Mahoney.

8

athletic associations that schools can join.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There are other

But that's somewhat

10

inconsistent with one of the most forceful arguments for

11

finding state action to begin it, i.e., that you have to

12

join the school if you really want to compete with most

13

of the schools.

14

You have to join the association.

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, I think -- I'm not

15

sure that's true, Justice Kennedy.

16

clear that in this Court's decisions in various areas

applying deferential First Amendment review, when

18

there's a voluntary relationship between the Government

and the citizen, that is precisely the reason that the

5

6

be interpreted?

7

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, let me

8

first address, in -- in the appendix to our brief is a

9

two page -- a two-sentence letter from Joe Marley to

10

Brentwood Academy.

This was in the same year in which

11

this alleged violation occurred; and in the two-sentence

12

letter, Ray Marley, the student's father, said it is our

13

attention for Ray to attend Brentwood Academy in

14

1997-98, Ray has my consent to participate in the speed

15

and strength program at Brentwood Academy.

16

The Association then informed the school

17

that it was able to allow this young man to come and

18

lift weights at the school based upon that letter.

19

when the school wrote a letter and had contact with the

20

student, based upon an enrollment contract, they thought

21

it was an a fortiori circumstance that if they could

22

have Ray Marley lift weights and be there and contact

23

the coach, that a much more elaborate contractual

24

enrollment form with signing of a contract and paying a

25

$300 deposit would allow them to, in fact, have contact

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Blumstein, am I not

correct for purposes of our decision, if you're claiming

4

constitutional protection, you're claiming that you'd be

5

constitutionally protected even if you knew in advance

6

that this particular communication would violate the

7

rule and even if you did it deliberately?

8

your constitutional position is, is it not?

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

significance of the voluntariness -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So that what really,

16

you're -- it is sort of a side issue as to whether they

17

really had adequate notice and so forth, insofar as

18

we're talking about the First Amendment?

19

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

involvement is ultimately whether there's a waiver; and

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the state set up two

3

athletic leagues and one had an anti-recruiting rule and

4

the other didn't, and they were equally strong, and you

5

chose to join the one that had the anti-recruiting

6

league.

7

in your opinion?

Would it be a violation of the First Amendment

8

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

And both are governmental?

9

Both are governmental, Justice Alito?

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, both are governmental.

11

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, I think if a private

12

party subjects itself voluntary, voluntarily to a

13

regulatory program run by the government or which is

14

attributable to the government, then under cases like

15

Ibanez, which we emphasize in our brief, that there is

16

an obligation on the part of the government to apply the

17

rules fairly, unless there is a waiver of some kind, the

18

waiver standard is the one that makes a difference.

19

I believe in terms of voluntariness, the only difference

20

is whether there is some kind of a waiver.

21

But

In Ibanez where the lawyer, who was also an

22

accountant, submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the

23

accounting board, there was nothing requiring her to

24

submit herself to that jurisdiction.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

30

imprimatur, certification, accreditation, and you as an

individual or an entity, private entity, seek that

problem is that the association, by not recognizing that

is called the careful calculation of cause and benefits.

Certainly.

We have to do

that.

what the government has done is okay.

it's invalid unless the government gathers together a

perfectly reasonable, we say tsk, tsk, oh, but even

5

though it came out right, they didn't consider speech?

But when it comes out right?

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

But Justice Scalia, in your

8

opinion in the Fox case, one of the safeguards that was

articulated for speech protection was the need to have a

procedural safeguard.

costs with respect to freedom of speech.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, how many cases have

23

there got to be before you would recognize the

24

sufficiency of the asserted state interest?

25

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, I think that once a

that all these families had made their educational

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, we know that.

They've signed the contract.

So that's where we start.

And you're saying, well, only about 5

percent of them weasel out of it later on and go to some

8

other school.

9

But why is 5 percent insufficient?

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, in this case, the

association allows the underlying practice itself.

11

permits the underlying practice.

13

It

And so if there's a concern about
recruiting -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that if the kid comes

If taking

fact, change their minds.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

1

there a legitimate interest in preventing recruiting

2

within the 5 percent?

3

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

But there's the whole cited

4

Question 3, Justice Souter.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

my question?

7

Yeah, but would you answer

Why isn't that enough?

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, I think, again, as

8

long as the association permits this activity and says

9

there is a risk of recruiting at that activity if the

10

students are not firmly committed, irrevocably committed

11

to a place, and that they allow that conduct, then to

12

allow the -- to bar the -- the school from talking about

13

or at least mentioning the -- the activity as an

14

opportunity, then at that point the association if it

15

wants to protect its interests must act to prohibit the

16

conduct, not the speech.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

There's no question about it.

It certainly can do

18

that.

19

that the line that is being drawn is a line between

20

contact which is initiated by the prospective student

21

and proselytizing which is initiated by the school.

22

isn't that a reasonable line?

23

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

But it seems to me

Why

Well, because -- Ms. Mahoney

24

cited an example that does not require initiated school

25

contact.

Question 3 prohibits all contact, whether it's
39

Yes.

And I am saying that if the

rule generally -- maybe quite imprecisely -- but if it

23

generally distinguishes between that kind of

24

proselytizing by a coach, and on the other hand contact

25

that a kid initiates in the first place, isn't that
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

roughly a fair line?

2

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, I don't think so,

3

Justice Souter, because once the association determines

4

that this activity is legitimate, and authorizes this

5

with respect to the feeder pattern, so that all public

6

schools can be -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the answer to that is,

17

they're not trying to prevent people, at least under

18

this rule, they're not trying to prevent 8th grade kids

19

from going to spring practice.

20

prevent coaches from proselytizing kids, and that's the

21

distinction.

22

They're trying to

Why isn't it a reasonable distinction?

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Well, the proselytization

23

here was found to be a harmless letter sent just

24

informing the kids that they had an opportunity.

25

guess it depends on how one characterizes what the

19

accused of offering inducements to students to attend

20

the school.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I mean, all of these

22

matters were discussed and there was an opportunity to

23

reply to all of these matters that we've just been

24

talking about, correct?

25

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Yes.

There was a procedure

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

in which there was an exchange of letters between the

2

association and the school, in which the association had

3

some investigation and then the school had an

4

opportunity to respond.

5

Yes, Judge Kennedy.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It doesn't seem to me like

6

there's a strong case for a flawed hearing for a due

7

process violation.

8
9

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

The problem was that the

district court made two findings in this regard that

10

were very important:

11

school as to what issues were still open and available;

12

and that ultimately a matter involving this Bart King

13

was discussed at the closed after-hearing session,

14

executive session, and the school had been told that the

15

Bart King allegations were no longer on the table.

16

That the association misled the

Now, the school did put forward evidence

17

about one youngster named Jacques Curry who was alleged

18

to have been recruited by Bart King.

19

had no status with the school at all.

20

Jacques Curry before the hearing panel and the hearing

21

panel wound up restoring his eligibility.

22

Again, Bart King
And they put

But it turns out that they, at the trial,

23

that the association members, or the board of control,

24

admitted that they considered the Bart King allegations

25

to enhance the penalty.

So it must have been something
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

beyond Jacques Curry and that the school was never

2

informed that the Bart King's involvement beyond Jacques

3

Curry had anything to did with the proceedings.

4

So the district court found there was

5

misleading of the school and that they -- the school

6

never had a chance to respond to the evidence that was

7

presented by these investigators for the association.

8

And so therefore they did not have evidence, they were

9

not aware of evidence, and they didn't have a chance to

10

respond or to reply to that evidence.

relationship to Brentwood Academy is and how -- and what

21

he is alleged to have done.

22

We have no control, we had no knowledge, of

anything that Mr. King did, and if any of those

allegations were true the school wanted an opportunity

to disassociate itself.

that you had a witness available to testify, but you

considered the King allegations.

what that meant at the trial.

We don't know exactly

Who considered it?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

That the board of control,

the TSSAA board.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Did you ask the people on

4

the board of control, what role did Mr. King play in

5

your decision?

6

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

And the answer that was

7

given at trial, and the trial judge found this, was that

8

he played a role, not in the liable but in the penalty.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that they might have

10

reduced it ed it from $3,000 to less had they not been

11

under the mistaken impression that Mr. King had

12

something to do with you when he did it.

the terms, the length of the probation, is what they

The concern was that the

7

this, that the King allegations were not on the table.

I thought it was a

I thought you were claiming there was

10

a violation of due process because an investigator spoke

11

without you present to the board.

12

MR. BLUMSTEIN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that I would think was

not a violation of the Constitution since it happens

if you want to claim it is, I'll be happy to listen.

19

would be a surprising claim to me.

disclosure of evidence as a basis of decision and an

22

opportunity to respond to that evidence in a

position that the First Amendment should apply

14

differently in this context, where the Government is

is the proper one that should be applied in this

circumstance and that there's not a need to carve out a

If I could respond to the due process

52
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's critical that when an association enters into a

2

contract and agrees upon procedures, that if those

3

procedures can -- are not followed, a member of the

4

association can bring a breach of contract action in

5

State court.

6

But Brentwood did not do that.

Instead it

7

tried to constitutionalize this contract dispute and

8

assert rights under Section 1983.

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought it had some

State claims as pendant claims.

11

MS. MAHONEY:

The only State claim they had

12

as a pendant claim was arbitrary action under State law,

13

and the district court dismissed that because it found

14

that the questions were sufficiently novel that he

15

didn't feel that he should entertain jurisdiction over

16

it.

17

But they did not assert a breach of contract claim.
And it's important to note that the bylaws

18

actually provide that a member must be given, quote,

19

"notice of the charges and an opportunity to present its

20

case at a hearing."

21

notice of the charges involving Bart King, it would have

22

been a breach of contract.

23

is that the court of appeals didn't even look at the
