We'll next hear Case

Ms. Seitz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIRGINIA A. SEITZ

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MS. SEITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The court of appeals held that plaintiffs

11

who obtain a preliminary injunction are prevailing

12

parties entitled to fees, even though the district court

13

concluded that the State's nudity ban does not violate

14

the Constitution, that plaintiffs were not entitled to

15

any permanent relief, and that final judgment should be

16

entered against the plaintiffs.

17

This Court's cases have found plaintiffs to

18

be prevailing parties in only two situations, when they

19

win judgment on the merits or enter into a consent

20

decree.

21

prevailing party status based on interim rulings in

22

ongoing litigation.

23

And this Court has declined to confer

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Seitz, I'd be curious

24

to get your reaction to one of the points made by

25

opposing counsel, which is that there were really sort
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of two different pieces of litigation at issue here,

2

that it was an as-applied challenge that produced the

3

preliminary injunction, and what was rejected in the

4

final decision was a facial challenge.

5

anything to that?

6

MS. SEITZ:

Is there

No, I don't think there is.

In

7

the preliminary injunction, the district court predicted

8

that it would find the nudity ban significantly

9

infringed free expression and that the State had less

10

restrictive alternatives.

11

In the summary judgment decision, the court held that

12

the nudity plan's effect on free impression was de

13

minimis and it had, that the State had no less

14

restrictive alternative.

15

underlying legal claim was that as applied to nude

16

expression the nudity ban was unconstitutional.

17

That's at page 18a and 19a.

So in both instances the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do we make of what I

18

understand was the court's post hoc statement that what

19

was -- the reason for issuing the temporary injunction

20

was the perception that there was a content basis at

21

work?

22

I think this is of record; you correct me if I'm wrong.

23

what do we make of that in light of the fact that I

24

believe it is in the record that I forget the

25

appropriate State official said, well, it's true we've

And what do we make of it in light of the fact -

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

let you do this in the past, but this is political or

2

this looks political, which suggests that there was a

3

content basis going on?

4

What do we make of the court's statement and

5

the record statement by the official in deciding whether

6

there really was in effect a separate kind of order

7

involved in the preliminary injunction from the order

8

that was denied at the end of the case?

9

MS. SEITZ:

There's a factual answer to that

10

and a legal answer, and I'll start with the legal

11

answer, which is that the preliminary injunction itself

12

states that it is assuming content -

13
14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. SEITZ:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

I know

that.

15

17

Oh, I know that.

And as a legal matter Because that's why I asked,

what do we make of the court's statement subsequently?
MS. SEITZ:

I think we, as the court of

19

appeals did, have to disregard those statements because

20

under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,

21

the preliminary injunction itself is the operative

22

document, and the bases that it states for the issuance

23

of the preliminary injunction are the bases that must

24

govern both on judicial review of the injunction and as

25

a matter of notice to the parties of the operative
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effect and basis for the injunction.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is that so when there is

3

some evidence in the record that a content basis

4

actually was the criterion?

5

MS. SEITZ:

And that's the factual part of

6

my response, which is that this testimony that was

7

relied on which we quote in full in our reply brief, was

8

testimony by the State, a State official who did not

9

make the decision so was not actually aware of why the

10

decision was made, and was testimony only to the effect

11

that the demonstration envisioned on February 14th might

12

be different than her previous plays, because more

13

people might be expected.

14

Now the court drew from that telephonic

15

testimony a possibility that the reason for the State's

16

denial on February 14 was the content; but in fact,

17

although the court didn't recognize it, it also had

18

before it a decision by the State in 2000 denying her

19

permission to put on her play based on its decision to

20

enforce its nudity ban against her at that time.

21
22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:
-- was it?

Now the 2001 order was it

She applied, I think it was in MS. SEITZ:

She wrote a letter in 2000

requesting permission to perform her play JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah.
6


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. SEITZ:

Under the same terms that she

2

had under the stipulated settlement from 1998.

3

State denied her request in a letter indicating that the

4

nudity ban would be enforced against the play.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So the factual answer in

6

effect is there isn't enough fact to support the

7

distinction?

8
9

MS. SEITZ:

The

And -- and I guess there's in

addition a legal elaboration on that factual record,

10

which was this was all occurring in a preliminary

11

injunction hearing that took place 24 hours before the

12

demonstration, telephonic testimony of an ill-prepared

13

State witness.

14

that claim remained live through summary judgment,

15

because the plaintiffs continued to have a claim against

16

an individual defendant for damages.

17

It was never followed up, even though

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah.

But when you got to

18

the summary judgment stage, the particular peace

19

demonstration performance was -- was behind them.

20

they're, I'm not sure that it would have been expected

21

to be reinjected into the case.

22

MS. SEITZ:

So

The challenge continued because

23

there was a claim for individual damages from the park

24

manager.

25

for damages, of course, the plaintiffs could have put in

So in order to determine that individual claim

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence that, in fact, rather than just as a

2

preliminary prediction, the injunction was issued to

3

prevent content-based discrimination.

4
5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So it wasn't moot after the

demonstration.

6

MS. SEITZ:

That was not mooted out.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's one of the

8

things that concerns me.

I mean in many of these cases

9

you have fairly elaborate proceedings over the

10

preliminary injunction and the event takes place.

11

would not want to get to a situation where people feel

12

the need to artificially keep a case alive simply to

13

ensure their entitlement to attorney's fees.

14

you protect against that?

15

MS. SEITZ:

I

So how do

We -- the purpose of the

16

attorney's fees provision is to encourage and reward

17

meritorious litigation.

18

only have a preliminary injunction, no matter how long

19

that preliminary injunction has been in effect, what you

20

have is a prediction of success on the merits, a

21

balancing of equitable factors that determine interim

22

fairness, but you do not have a decision that the

23

defendant has violated the Constitution or any Federal

24

law.

25

And at the point at which you

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in, but in many cases

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the case will become moot after a period of time and the

2

Chief Justice and I have the same concern.

3

is directed to do we just keep this litigation alive for

4

the -- for the ancillary issue of attorney's fees?

5

MS. SEITZ:

The question

There are significant

6

consequences to a finding of liability.

And to

7

conferring preliminary -- or fees for preliminary

8

injunction when you do not have a final determination of

9

violation by the State, you're essentially ordering the

10

State and local governments who have not been judged

11

violators of law or had a full or fair opportunity to

12

defend as a matter of law -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we're asking about

14

what rule you propose we adopt and the submission to you

15

is that if we have a rule there can never be attorneys

16

fees in this instance, that will then create pressure to

17

continue the litigation when it's for all practical

18

purposes of no real importance to the parties, other

19

than to just establish attorney's fees.

20

a waste of resources.

21

MS. SEITZ:

And that seems

And but the -- the situation -

22

that situation will also obtain if you confer attorney's

23

fees and prevailing party status on a plaintiff who only

24

has a preliminary injunction.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But do we have to judge

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

all preliminary and judgments alike?

2

cases, the preliminary injunction is the thing.

3

example, suppose in this case, the demonstrators had

4

said yeah, we went in with a -- with a broad challenge

5

but we knew all we wanted was that peace demonstration,

6

and we got it; so we're -- that's enough.

7

going to fight on.

8
9

MS. SEITZ:

I mean, in some
For

We're not

The fact that a plaintiff gets

his or her way temporarily based on a preliminary

10

junction does not mean that the defendant has violated

11

that plaintiff's constitutional rights or that that

12

would be the resolution of the -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Who -- who -- where does it

14

say you have to have done that?

My statute here says in

15

any action to enforce a provision of 1983 -- the TRO or

16

whatever was such an action.

17

discretion may allow the prevailing party an attorneys'

18

fee.

19

they wanted.

20

anything about whether you have been declared horrible

21

or wonderful or violator or not a violator.

22

they get what they want in the action?

23

End of matter.

It says the court in its

Well, did they prevail fail or not?
And it was such an action.

They got what
Doesn't say

It says did

Answer, yes.

24

Now what's wrong with reading it that way?

25

MS. SEITZ:

To prevail you must prevail on a
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

legal claim.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, they got the legal

3

claim.

4

demonstration on February 14; we have a right to do it

5

and therefore issue an order.

6

the order, because they don't.

7
8
9
10

The legal claim is we want to have our

MS. SEITZ:

You said no, don't issue
And therefore, they won.

Respectfully, that's not a legal

claim.
JUSTICE BREYER:
MS. SEITZ:

It is not?

The underlying legal claim is

11

that the State's denial of the permit was

12

unconstitutional.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

But what about the

14

legal claim we are under the law entitled to a

15

preliminary injunction.

16
17
18
19

MS. SEITZ:

That is a type of relief you are

seeking but it's based on an underlying legal claim.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is not a determination,

is it, that they have a right to hold a demonstration?

20

MS. SEITZ:

It is -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is just a determination

22

that we don't know at this point enough to say that you

23

don't have a right.

24
25

MS. SEITZ:

It is a product of an equitable

balancing that determines interim fairness 11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well I thought, where it

2

say that in the statute that you have to have that

3

particular kind of a claim?

4

MS. SEITZ:

I think this Court's cases have

5

interpreted the word prevail and prevailing parties to

6

mean you must prevail on the merits of a legal claim.

7

The only instance in which that is not true is in a

8

consent decree scenario and in a consent decree what you

9

have is a defendant assuming legal responsibility for

10

providing relief on the merits that resolves a claim.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what do you do in

12

a situation of mootness where there's -- you know,

13

they'd be happy to pursue the claim to establish that

14

they prevail on a permanent junction as well as a

15

preliminary one, but the case has become moot.

16

automatically disentitled to attorneys' fees in that

17

case?

18

MS. SEITZ:

Are they

A claim that is never resolved

19

cannot be the basis of prevailing party status.

20

that's what your hypothetical poses.

21

it's not correct to say there is no point in continuing

22

with litigation in that setting.

23

general setting, there is a value to having at the end

24

of litigation a decision -

25

And

And I also think

In a private attorney

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, there may be a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pint to pursuing it but I'm not sure it's one that the

2

locality governments -- I mean if you ask them the

3

question, would you rather be liable for attorney's fees

4

where you lose in a preliminary injunction but then the

5

case becomes moot, or would you rather have to face

6

individual officer liability to prevent the case from

7

becoming moot?

8

litigation to prevent the case from becoming moot

9

because there's too much invested in the fees -- they

10
11

Or would you rather face ongoing

might choose the former.
MS. SEITZ:

Well in this case, of course,

12

the State officials decided to defend the

13

constitutionality of their nudity ban to the end.

14

was important to them.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

Well, the plaintiffs

16

decided to challenge it to the end.

17

that if they know they might -- it might result in a

18

loss of attorneys fees, when all they really wanted was

19

a particular demonstration, others might pursue it

20

differently.

21

MS. SEITZ:

But I'm suggesting

There are significant

22

countervailing considerations, and one is that under the

23

rule you're proposing, state and local governments would

24

be fearful about enforcing perfectly valid laws in

25

emergency situations for fear of being penalized with
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fees.

2

Then they have no fair chance JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you are saying the

3

Chief Justice is proposing a rule.

I think he was

4

asking you -- you want to just give us all or nothing.

5

And we're suggesting that it just doesn't make systemic

6

good sense to insist that every preliminary injunction

7

be carried through to a final adjudication for

8

attorney's fees.

9

ground.

And we are asking is there some midway

And you, you've so far -- you can structure the

10

argument the way you want, but you so far are -- in

11

effect telling me absolutely not.

12

MS. SEITZ:

I -- I think that because of the

13

rule I distill from this Court's case which is that you

14

can't prevail on a claim that's not decided, it's hard

15

for me to see what the middle ground would be.

16

course have the alternative ground for decision in this

17

case which is that a claim, a preliminary junction

18

that's issued in ongoing litigation whose prediction on

19

the merits is later essentially proven to be false by

20

subsequent litigation, can't be the basis for prevailing

21

party -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

We do of

So what do you think, when

23

this was enacted, to make up an example that it is as

24

horrifying as I can think, where the Ku Klux Klan was

25

So -- and we don't really care

Now they get their

1983 was written, it's that one.

And if in fact it is clear that

there is no issue law in that setting.

arguments.

16

I

Oh, there is.

The other

And they each have

There are plenty of issues of law.
MS. SEITZ:

Then you just articulated why

17

that plaintiff should not be considered a prevailing

18

party without taking the position that that is capable

19

of repetition, but evading review situation, arguing

20

that in effect the judgment is based totally on law and

21

converting it essentially to a judgment on the merits,

22

or otherwise coming to a final judgment on a claim, so

23

that the plaintiff would have -

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why should a

plaintiff do that when the plaintiff's position is we
15
Alderson Reporting Company

got precisely what we wanted; this is not going to be -

2

this is a one-time only demonstration.

to repeat this.

say in this case, you lost on the merits?

made a prediction.

7

wrong.

9

The judge

Turned out that -- that that was

MS. SEITZ:

To -- to impose attorney's fees

on a defendant, it's not simply about what the plaintiff

10

gets, whether the plaintiff gets what he wants, but it

11

is also about what the justification is for forcing the

12

state and local government to pay fees.

13

And the purpose of the Civil Rights Act is

14

to impose such fees against violators of civil rights

15

and for the benefit of victims of similar rights

16

violation, and not simply on those whom it is predicted

17

will have a substantial likelihood of success on the

18

merits.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you get a case that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it -- can a

2

preliminary injunction never be the basis for an award

3

of attorney's fees?

4

MS. MILLETT:

I won't say never in this

5

narrow circumstance.

And that is when, when a

6

preliminary injunction results in a definitive and

7

determinative ruling of law such as Thornburgh versus

Obstetricians -- College of Obstetricians and

Gynecologists, or the steel mill seizure case from this

Court.

It came up on a preliminary injunction but this

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a consent decree, but

3

MS. MILLE TT:

No, that's right.

This

4

Court, while repeatedly stating, including unanimously

5

just two years ago, that the central justification for

6

attorney's fees is that the defendant is a violator of

7

Federal law, has found that it will also permit

8

attorney's fees in the consent decree situation, but

9

that's because there you have a defendant who is not

10

fighting and continuing to resist any form of final

11

relief, has instead agreed to provide final relief that

12

runs to a plaintiff, in favor of a plaintiff, and that

13

advances the purpose of Federal law.

14

show because that can all be dealt with through the

8

contract elements of the consent agree.

9

you're talking about when a court is coercively imposing

10

attorney's fees on a defendant is that the defendant has

11

a right to not pay those unless they have been found to

12

be a violator of Federal law or have agreed to through

13

contract to deal with that issue.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And really what

Okay, but the argument is

15

undercut, as you yourself say, by the settlement rule.

16

Don't we have the settlement rule simply because we want

17

to promote settlements?

18

on and on and on simply because somebody wants to

19

establish a right to attorney's fees.

20

same reasoning apply here when there is a preliminary

21

injunction and that's all the person wants.

22

reasoning that we accept a settlement, why shouldn't we

23

accept a preliminary injunction as being a sufficient

24

determination of rights to justify fees because we don't

want it to go on and on and on when nobody has any issue

We don't want litigation to go

of substance involved, but is just litigating for the

sake of establishing a right to fees later?

3

MS. MILLETT:

I have three answers to that.

First of all, there are two parties here.

has a right not to be assessed attorney's fees, which

6

are a form of final relief not interim relief, without a

7

final decision that they violated on the merits.

8

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The defendant

But the only attorney's

fees that would be assessed would be attorney's fees
attributable to the preliminary injunction.

11

MS. MILLETT:

That's right, but they have a

12

right not to pay anything if they haven't done anything

13

wrong.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They have been found

15

subject to a preliminary injunction.

16

is no longer even.

17

MS. MILLETT:

And there's not even always a

No.
You haven't violated any

Federal law.

6

MS. MILLETT:

This is a case in point.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it does mean, it does

8

mean that somebody with a burden to establish an

9

entitlement to the injunction has carried the burden.

10

MS. MILLETT:

Well, the test is the

11

prevailing party, not the substantially likely to

12

prevail party.

13
14

And the other reason -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then let's not have it in

the settlement case.

15

MS. MILLETT:

Well, again settlements can be

16

dealt with through the settlement, as part of the

17

settlement process.

18

But I think -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They are voluntary, these

19

settlements, aren't they?

20

that the innocent person who gets stuck with attorney's

21

fees for settling gets what he asked for, right?

22

voluntary.

24
25

MS. MILLETT:

So you could at least say

It's

explain to Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That may be, but that's not

the way the statute is written.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would this case be

3

different if the defendant had consented to the entry of

4

a preliminary injunction?

5

MS. MILLETT:

No, I don't think so, and I

6

don't think courts as a matter of judicial economy want

7

to tell the government every time we agree not to

8

oppose, to stay the removal of an alien, that we somehow

9

would get a bill.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So if this had been, if

11

they had entered into a consent decree covering just the

12

one event on the front burner, that would have been?

13

MS. MILLETT:

A consent decree is a final

14

resolution of a claim that legally obligates the

15

defendant, final relief that runs in favor of the

16

plaintiff.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if they consented to

18

the entry of a preliminary injunction, why wouldn't that

19

be equally binding?

20

MS. MILLETT:

Because it is not a final

21

resolution.

Preliminary injunctions are important.

22

They're of value to the parties.

23

trade-off in getting it.

24

them is they aren't committed to final relief.

Well, they were able to go

3

ahead with their one demonstration that precipitated the

4

litigation, and they would have been able to do it the

5

same way if they had a consent decree instead of having

6

the other side not fight very vigorously in opposition

7

to the preliminary.

8
9

MS. MILLETT:

The defendant who'S been fully

vindicated at the end of the case shouldn't have to

10

write checks to two attorneys instead of just their own.

11

There's a fundamental fairness element here.

12

But also on the judicial economy -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But then why isn't the

14

attorney -- if there were a consent decree -- I don't

15

understand the difference.

16

MS. MILLETT:

Because the defendant's in the

17

control of the fairness issue in the consent decree and

18

is not in this situation.

19

But the other situation, concern, is concern

20

about judicial economy.

And there's arguments in the

21

amicus briefs on the other side that preliminary

22

injunctions are common.

23

central justification is that the plaintiff is a private

24

attorney general who doesn't just do what they want to

do, but either resolves the issue of law or obtains

MR. GALANTER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

Respondents went into Federal court because

legal claim was that these regulations were invalid

under the First Amendment.

claim.

MR. GALANTER:

5

First Amendment and there was evidence at the

preliminary injunction stage that -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they succeeded

in filing their complaint as well, but they don't get

MR. GALANTER:

As opposed to, as

Well, two things, Your Honor.

As I think I made clear to Justice Alito, if the

decision is reversed or repudiated by the district

2

MR. GALANTER:

What do you envision?

Well, in the hypothetical

where the same facts, the same law, and the district

court says I was wrong, that would be the kind of

5

repudiation.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, Your Honor, it's not.

21

theories.

22

He said I

And JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where -- can you -- I

23

thought what he said was -- I thought they wanted a

24

demonstration that was going to be secure from public

25

view, and instead I understand now that's not -- that
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wasn't what they wanted from the start.

2

So on the premise on which I was operating,

3

I was right, that they were going to do it just like the

4

plays.

5

I was wrong because those facts were not before me.

6

those facts been before me, they would have lost on the

7

preliminary injunction.

But what they really planned to do, and did do,

8
9

MR. GALANTER:

Had

I don't believe that that's

the fairest reading of the district court's subsequent

10

orders in this case.

11

was that his as-applied holding, that the plays and the

12

war protests were being treated differently.

13

that it's -

14

What the district court made clear

Yes, but assume the

district court thought he was right at the preliminary

16

injunction, and ruled otherwise at the permanent

17

junction.

reviews the fee application, thinks he was wrong both

19

times?

20

But what if the court of appeals when it

MR. GALANTER:

Well, Your Honor, we would

suggest that the person in the best position to

22

understand what the district court was doing -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

MR. GALANTER:

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is the district court.

Yes, Your Honor.
But maybe the court of

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appeals is in the best position to determine whether

2

they made an error of law or not.

3

MR. GALANTER:

Yes.

And obviously they

4

review errors of law, questions of law -

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if they think he made

6

an error of law, what should they do?

7

MR. GALANTER:

If he had made an error of

8

law in the preliminary injunction ruling that, on

9

de novo review, and reversed, then -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, there's no reverse.

11

It's too late.

12

all over.

13

court of appeals concludes that the district judge -

14

the decision represented an incorrect premise of law and

15

therefore, he did make an error.

16

would the district judge's view of the validity of his

own decision control?

They've had the demonstration so it's

What I'm suggesting, though, is that -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought the hypothetical

was different, was, the case proceeds to final judgment

on the merits; and at that point -- okay -- at that

was valid or not comes up, not in the direct appeal from

What my -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if I may, I agree with Justice Breyer's hypothetical

2

that if you're appealing the merits and the court of

3

appeals says something which shows that the -- the

4

preliminary injunction should not have been issued,

5

we're not a prevailing party.

6

Justice Scalia that if you're appealing from the

7

preliminary injunction and the court of appeals

8

reverses, then you're not the prevailing party.

9

Justice Stevens, what I would suggest to you and to

I agree with

But

10

Justice Kennedy was, we shouldn't be adjudicating

11

whether the preliminary injunction was correctly entered

12

at the fees stage.

13

If there is -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any authority for

14

that?

Because it does seem to me wrong, that where a

15

person has got a preliminary injunction and it's legally

16

unsupportable, and then he gets the fee but then they

17

appeal that and the court of appeals determines it's

18

legally unsupportable, he never should have gotten it,

19

I'd be surprised if there is a case that awards the fee

20

in those circumstances, but maybe there is.

21

MR. GALANTER:

Well, I mean, the courts of

22

appeals have adopted different standards.

What is it?

JUSTICE BREYER:

I can't point

MR. GALANTER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I would be surprised.
But the The other thing that I

6

wonder about this case is, are you the prevailing party?

7

And the reason I ask that is because when I look through

8

the record it seems to me your clients are very

9

interesting.

They have their point of view.

And their

10

point of view, one of their points of view was that the

11

state said you can have this demonstration, just wear a

skimpy swimming suit.

going to put up a cloth so other people who don't want

17

we didn't in the past.

thought, well, maybe what they got was, they got a

preliminary injunction or a TRO, whatever you want to

20

call it, but it didn't stop the State from putting up

the cloth.

should have been pretty clear that they were going to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But your people didn't want

a screen.

6

MR. GALANTER:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

That included a screen.

That's correct, Your Honor.
So they didn't get what

they asked for.

9

MR. GALANTER:

They didn't get removed from

10

the beach or arrested for being nude either, Your Honor,

11

so they did get what they wanted.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's only because,

13

I guess the other side didn't take the action that they

14

could have taken if they didn't -- if they didn't apply

15

the screen.

MR. GALANTER:

Your Honor, when you obtain

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And since they didn't use

2

the screen, the State was not prohibited from arresting

3

them; is that correct?

4

MR. GALANTER:

That's correct.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So they did not get what

6

they asked for.

Mainly a prohibition against the state

7

interfering with the kind of demonstration they wanted,

8

which was one without a screen.

9

that.

You say they didn't get

10
11

MR. GALANTER:

They didn't get that, but

12

they got something more than they had when they went in,

13

which was, they got the right to be naked on the beach,

14

which would have otherwise subjected them to arrest.

15

And, I mean -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The state had no problem

17

with that.

18

as long as they had the screen.

19

In the past the State had let them do that,

MR. GALANTER:

It wouldn't let them do that

20

this time even with the screen.

It sent them a letter

21

saying you may not appear on the beach nude.

22

mean, obviously, at some times you don't get -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I

So the State

24

prevailed to some extent as well.

They prevailed to the

25

extent of getting in the order that they can do what

they had done, which is erect a screen.

3

MR. GALANTER:

They -- yes.

They

narrowed -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So they're entitled

5

to some -- I mean, if -- this is not a reciprocal

6

switching thing, but I mean, it does go to the question

7

of whether or not you are the prevailing party when your

8

opponents have prevailed to a significant extent as

9

well.

10

MR. GALANTER:

With respect, even if we had

11

sought and obtained a permanent injunction that allowed

12

us to protest but not behind the screen, we'd be a

13

prevailing party, although the defendants by their

14

successful advocacy would have narrowed the scope of the

15

injunction.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask you this.

Is

17

it correct that an underlying principle of law that

18

justified your claim for relief and your actual relief

19

was that there's some First Amendment right to

20

demonstrate in the nude?

21
22

MR. GALANTER:

Yes, Your Honor, that was an

underlying part of that.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

our cases for that proposition, if any?

25

MR. GALANTER:

And what is the support in

Well, I think this Court's
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases in Barnes, the nude dancing cases suggest that

2

expressive activity combined with nudity is protected by

3

the First Amendment.

4

Circuit wrote an extensive opinion in a case called

5

Tunic versus Zapper, where he surveys this Court's

6

cases, and finds that occasionally there may be for

7

artistic or political reasons a right to be nude as part

8

of more expressive conduct.

9

Judge Calabrese in the Second

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. GALANTER:

But to take

17

this back just one step, to the notion that we either

not need something that's sort of enduring or merits

We

That is -- you know, that's double

indemnity.

I mean, it's multiplying the extraordinary

9

departure from our usual practice, which is that each

10

side pays his own.

11

you're a bad actor, in certain circumstances, civil

12

rights cases, we'll make you pay the other side.

13

it's another thing to say if you're -- if you're not a

14

bad actor in a civil rights case but you're unlucky

15

enough to get hit with a preliminary injunction, we'll

make you pay for the other side.

statute authorizing these fees.

doesn't often do things that are grossly unfair.

23

there are various interpretations, one of which is not

Speaking of the language, we

Well, before you leave

that, I wonder if -- there's one other thing floating

around in my mind.

11

word is prevailing, and if I go with you on the ground

that it's flexible and can apply to all kinds of things,

13

at least you have to really be prevailing, is there a

14

good faith element in that?

clients when they went in to get this order and they got

16

it, and at that time they had no intention of following

what they had to do.

of going out and tearing down the curtain.

19

enter into the determination of whether they are really

a prevailing party who ought to get their attorney's

I might as well bring it up.

That is to say, if your

Rather, they had every intention

MR. GALANTER:

Does that

I think, Your Honor, that -

23

well, first of all, the preliminary injunction itself

was an equitable remedy.

25

into that question, and yes, in determining the amount

Unclean hands could have gone

Alderson Reporting Company

of fees, again, equity can be considered.

faith of the parties, just as the complete bad faith of

awarded for the defendants.

Although you can go into court knowing that -

17

MR. GALANTER:

And everyone here -- excuse

20
21
22

And everyone here knew that absent an appeal, this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

On the February

14th, but your client sought further relief.
MR. GALANTER:

Yes.

But it also sought it

23

as a discrete claim for relief in the complaint, this

24

very injunction.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You get costs?

51
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

phrase is "attorney's fees as part of costs".

2

you get costs for up to the preliminary injunction?

3

MR. GALANTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

So, do

The

4

district court in this case awarded us costs and also

5

awarded the other side costs.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

So you would split the

costs?

8
9

And that's actually -

MR. GALANTER:

He found we were both

prevailing parties in the case.

And that's also

10

consistent with this Court's decision in Hensley, which

11

says you look at a case and the unrelated claims; you

12

can find that the plaintiffs are prevailing parties on

13

some, the defendants are prevailing parties on others,

14

and order cross awards of attorney's fees.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So this defendant, having

16

succeeded in being the winner in the whole case, didn't

17

get costs for the whole case; is that what you're

18

telling me?

19

MR. GALANTER:

They were awarded -- they

20

sought and were awarded all their costs for the entire

21

case, or they sought their costs for the entire case.

22

It was reduced by the district court as a matter of

23

equity.

24

among various parties to the case.

25

But they -- not because -- not parsing it out

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So they were entitled to

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

costs for the entire case?

2

MR. GALANTER:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

Yes, they were, Your Honor.
And attorney's fees under

the statute are to be awarded as part of costs?

5

MR. GALANTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if you're not entitled

7

to costs, if the defendant got the full costs, then how

8

do you get entitled to attorney's fees when the statute

9

puts them together?

10

Because attorney's fees are part of

costs.

11

MR. GALANTER:

That's correct.

And there

12

are many cases where both parties end up getting awarded

13

costs.

Hensley was one that suggested it was possible.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MR. GALANTER:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17
18

But this wasn't -

No.
This was one that the

state got all of its costs from your client?
MR. GALANTER:

Yes.

And our client got

19

costs from the state.

There were counter awards -

20

cross awards of cost, which is not unusual in civil

21

litigation with multiple claims.

22

But more importantly, I think, when we go

23

back and we look at the purposes, not only do we have

24

the language here, we also have the recognition, I think

25

as I was mentioning to the Chief Justice, that there's

I know you were

asked this question and your answer may have just

22

slipped by me.

would you not be entitled to fees on that?

To

Why, if you had asked for a TRO, why

MR. GALANTER:

We think that Congress's

distinction as far as putting preliminary injunctions
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and permanent injunctions in one category and TROs in

2

another for purposes of appealability, reflect kind of a

3

congressional judgment about which is -- which mechanism

4

is intended to alter the kind of substantial rights.

5

And absent the rights to appeal, absent the

6

adversariness, the heavier focus on irreparable

7

injuries, unlike at the preliminary injunction stage,

8

those are all things that we think make TROs generally

9

ineligible to affect prevailing party status.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Because the TRO case,

11

characteristically the other side isn't heard, so you

12

haven't prevailed.

13

MR. GALANTER:

That is one way to view it,

14

Your Honor.

15

there really was no one to prevail over.

16

here -

17

Without the adversariness at the hearing,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

Whereas

I thought you

18

prevailed in the sense that you secured relief.

19

how you articulated it up to this point.

20

MR. GALANTER:

That's

Well, this Court has

21

certainly described some relief as the threshold of

22

prevailing.

23

other kinds of orders, as this Court suggested in

24

Hanrahan versus Hampden, that are just not sufficiently

25

-- they don't have a sufficient change in the legal

I'm simply suggesting that there may be

55

relationship between the parties to warrant prevailing

2

party status, even though they do benefit the

3

plaintiffs.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you surely wouldn't

5

say that the fact that the other side never shows up

6

means that you can't get your attorney's fees.

7
8

MR. GALANTER:

No, Your Honor.

What I'm

suggesting -

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're a prevailing

10

party whether there's an adversary on the other side or

11

not.

12

MR. GALANTER:

What I'm saying is that the

13

TRO anticipates that, which is in part why we're not

14

suggesting TROs are -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

But in this very

16

case, if you had gotten a TRO instead of a preliminary

17

injunction, you'd have exactly the same practical

18

situation.

19

MR. GALANTER:

Yes, Your Honor, but we were

20

-- we did have a preliminary injunction.

21

therefore did have a right to appeal, and a lot of other

22

consequences flow from the fact that there -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The State did make a

24

point, that they were kind of -- this was short notice

And so we moved as quickly as we could.

MR. GALANTER:

Your Honor, those same

Petitioner's per se rule that preliminary injunction is

6

the unfortunate incentive of pushing the decisions very

7

close to the actual event deadline so that even if they

8

lose in court, they won't have to pay attorney's fees.

So we have a whole core of

And I would add that in terms of the broader

10

notion, here we have a midlevel state official sending a

11

letter to an individual saying we don't think you have

12

any First Amendment rights, and if you come, you'll be

13

violating a law that's subject to criminal arrest, if

criminal arrest.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY VIRGINIA A. SEITZ

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

clarify that point about costs?

Ms. Seitz, would you
Did your client have to

MS. SEITZ:

The plaintiffs were awarded

costs incurred on the preliminary injunction.

3

was awarded a right to costs on the remainder of the

4

litigation.

5

precise costs that the plaintiff was awarded on

6

preliminary injunction, so in the end no one received

7

any costs.

9

remainder of the case.

My client

Those costs were reduced to mirror the

timing.

13

nude and received a denial letter in response, similar

14

to the one she received in 2003.

16

her activities.

17

So she was on notice

Second, I want to say that the district

18

court itself characterized its holding on summary

19

judgment, quote, "as plaintiffs are unable to show

20

actual success on the merits," page 34a of the appendix.

21

So there's no doubt that what even the court understood

22

its own holding to be was that the prediction in the

23

preliminary injunction had failed to materialize when

24

the court considered the full case on the merits.

25

And finally, I want to say that awarding
59
Alderson Reporting Company

fees, conferring fees for a plaintiff for obtaining a

2

preliminary injunction essentially requires the State

3

treasury to pay its opponents when, in fact, the State

4

has done nothing but enforce a valid law.

5

that in this case because the case ended up getting

6

litigated to conclusion.

7

know that in other cases involving preliminary

injunctions doesn't mean it isn't true, and that's why

it's fundamentally unfair to impose fees on State
