CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 10-788, Rehberg v. Paulk.

Mr. Pincus.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This Court has twice held, in Malley and in

10
11

Kalina, that a complaining witness who sets a criminal

12

prosecution in motion by submitting a false affidavit is

13

entitled to qualified immunity, but not absolute

14

immunity, in an action under section 1983.

15

rested that conclusion on its determination that

16

complaining witnesses were subject to damages liability

17

at common law when -- in 1871 when section 1983 was

18

enacted.

19

The Court

The question in this case is whether the

20

rule of Malley and Kalina also applies to a complaining

21

witness who sets a prosecution in motion by testifying

22

before a grand jury.

23

answer.

24

could be based on false grand jury testimony.

25

Again, the common law provides the

The law is clear that in 1871 damages liability

JUSTICE ALITO:

The problem I have with your

argument is that I don't really know what a complaining

2

witness is in the grand jury context.

3

Federal grand jury as an example.

4

are complaining witnesses before Federal grand juries?

5

MR. PINCUS:

Let's take the

Do you think there

I think there -- there can be.

6

It depends obviously on the -- the circumstances, Your

7

Honor, but -- but there certainly can be.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

A complaining witness, I

9

would think, is a person who files a complaint, who

10

causes -- so, under the Federal system, it would be

11

someone who files a complaint and attests to it under

12

Rule 5.

13

That's what it means to be a complaining witness, filing

14

a complaint.

15

That person is asking that charges be brought.

Nobody -- no witness before a Federal grand

16

jury asks that an indictment be returned.

17

testimony, and they may want an indictment to be

18

returned, but it's the prosecutor who asks for the

19

indictment to be returned.

20

a complaining witness in that sense in the traditional

21

grand jury context.

22

MR. PINCUS:

They provide

So, I don't see how there is

Well, Your Honor, the common

23

law confronted precisely the same situation, and after

24

public prosecutors came into being and when grand juries

25

were empaneled by them, the common law has concluded
4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that, both in 1871 and in the present, that there can be

2

a person who is the motivating force behind the

3

prosecution, who --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A person?

What --

5

what if you have three elements to a crime, and you have

6

one witness for each one.

You see somebody sees the guy

7

trying to get into a car.

Well, maybe he left it --

8

maybe he locked his keys in.

9

walking around with a television.

Another sees the guy
It might be his.

10

third sees the guy selling the television to somebody

11

else.

12

testifies before the grand jury.

13

witness?

A

There's nothing wrong with that.

14

MR. PINCUS:

Each one

Who is the complaining

Well, Your Honor, at common

15

law, the complaining witness was more than just someone

16

who gave evidence that was necessary for the warrant or

17

the indictment to issue.

18

for the prosecution to be brought.

19

problems, of course, occurred at common law, and they

20

also occur in connection with the circumstances that the

21

Court addressed in Malley and Kalina.

22

It was someone who was pushing

JUSTICE ALITO:

All of these

Well, let me give you

23

another example that I think happens with some

24

frequency.

incriminating testimony.

It could be both.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Pincus, you said -- I

20

the complaint that was filed in this case, and it

21

says -- and this is on page 28 of the joint appendix.

22

It says Mr. Hodges -- that's the prosecutor -- knew or

23

should have known there was no probable cause.

24

Mr. Hodges, "directed Mr. Paulk to appear before the

25

grand jury and attest to the truth of such charges."

MR. PINCUS:

But the prosecutor gets

Mr. Paulk knew that his testimony was false and -- and

made it -- and gave his testimony anyway.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if he did it -- if he

10

did at the prosecutor's bidding, then he is not the

11

prime mover.

12

MR. PINCUS:

Well, the -- the complaint also

13

alleges that they were conspiring together to bring this

14

complaint.

And so, again, I think the facts will be

15

developed.

But the -- the first indictment in fact

listed Mr. Paulk as the complainant.

18

is someone who sets the prosecution in motion.

That's

JUSTICE ALITO:

The holding that you're

of the subpoena does negate things that might -- take

16

17

done to set the prosecution in motion.

I don't think the subpoena negates that
I don't think you can say, oh, now that

But I think in the hypothetical that you

19

propounded, where there's -- the sole fact is someone

20

doesn't do anything, they're subpoenaed to come before

21

the grand jury and they give their evidence, that

22

wouldn't meet the test.

23

But --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In a case where the

24

prosecutor is the prime mover, can there ever be a

25

complaining witness?

Where the prosecutor is making the
10


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decisions, can there ever be a complaining witness?

2

MR. PINCUS:

I think there can be, Your

3

Honor.

And, in fact, what this Court has indicated in

4

other cases is that the fact that the prosecutor

5

ultimately decides to seek the charge does not negate


6

what's happened before.


7

In the Hartman case, which dealt with a


8

retaliatory prosecution under -- a First Amendment


9

retaliation prosecution, the Court said the postal


10

inspectors, who in that case were alleged to have been

11

the motivating force behind the retaliatory prosecution,

12

could be held liable if there also was no probable

13

cause.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is the prosecutor a

complaining witness?

16

MR. PINCUS:

The prosecutor can't be a

17

complaining witness because the complaining witness is

I think that's right, Your

6

Honor.

But I don't think the Court is writing on a

7

blank slate here.

8

There has been a malicious prosecution tort for hundreds

9

of years.

Tort law has addressed these issues.

There certainly was in 1871, and tort law has

10

dealt and continues to deal with the questions of

11

causation and proximate cause and all of the questions

12

that arise in these kinds of cases.

13

the Court here would be writing on a blank slate.

14

So, it's not as if

And I think the critical thing is -- the

15

question here is whether or not there was an absolute

16

immunity rule in 1871 for persons in the situation of

17

the Respondent.

18

Court has framed.

19

That is the critical question that the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He -- the instigator,

20

what you call the complaining witness, would have

21

been immune if he gave the identical testimony at the

22

trial itself, right?

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, trial -- because --

24

because -- well, the trial testimony could not be the

25

basis for finding the person a complaining witness

because by that point, the prosecution has gotten

2

rolling.

prove that this is the person who was the instigator,

4

the prime mover behind the prosecution?

5

The question is, what conduct can be used to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

what you call the complaining witness that gets this

7

special treatment?

8

grand jury would be absolutely immune?

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's what

10

the common law rule was, and that's what Congress

11

confronted when it enacted section 1983 in 1871.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I make sure I

13

understand what you just said, Mr. Pincus?

14

said it can't be the testimony alone, is that right,

15

that there have to be other acts exclusive of the

16

testimony that make somebody a complaining witness?

17

MR. PINCUS:

When you

No, Your Honor, it could be the

18

testimony alone.

19

what I meant to say, maybe in response to

20

Justice Alito's question, was the fact of testifying

21

under subpoena doesn't negate other evidence that's

22

there.

23

certainly are cases, common law cases, from the 1800s in

24

which courts rely on testimony.

25

I didn't mean to say that.

I think

But the testimony alone can be enough, and there

witness.

the hypotheticals.

subpoenaed and they've come forward and they've given

their evidence.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you said that the

13

issuance of a subpoena in itself is not sufficient to

14

make somebody not a complaining witness.

15

issued a subpoena, you still might be a complaining

16

witness if you really didn't need to get a subpoena.

17

you could have been persuaded to go without a subpoena,

So, that's the

But what is the reason why,

14

if we give absolute immunity to the witness at a trial,

15

we give absolute immunity to the prosecutors and

strictly.

So, I

strictly?

2

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think there are two

3

reasons, Your Honor.

4

Court has said is that immunity decisions are based on

5

the common law as --

6

The first reason is that what this

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose I don't accept

7

that.

Suppose I say, yes, I accept that, there's a

8

relationship, but exactly what happened in 1871 is not

9

precisely always the convincing feature for me.

So, I

10

read what the situation is today, and it is, I think, as

11

I described it.

12

question remains.

13

So, given the situation today, my

MR. PINCUS:

Well, one -- one brief

14

disagreement with your question, Your Honor.

15

the situation today at common law is what it was.

16
17

question.

But -I would like an answer to

my question.

22

MR. PINCUS:

The answer is several-fold.

23

The Court has given absolute immunity to witnesses in

24

Briscoe.

25

the common law rule.

The policy reason -- the principal reason was
The policy reasons that the Court
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

gave were (a) we don't want to deter people from coming

2

forward; and (b) the testimony will be put through the

3

adversary process and is public, and those are

4

protections against false testimony.

5

In the -- in the grand jury situation, those

6

protections are not present, neither transparency nor an

7

adversary process.

8

about people coming forward I think applies in the grand

9

jury context as well to complaining witnesses.

And what the Court said in Malley

The

10

Court in Malley said we want people who are setting the

11

prosecution in motion, the special category of

12

complaining witnesses -- we want them to think twice.

13

That's not a bad thing when they are the motivating

14

force behind the prosecution.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

Well, I thought the

16

whole point of the grand jury was to protect citizens

17

from unwarranted prosecutions.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. PINCUS:

No, go ahead.

The grand jury's decision is a

10

step in the chain, but the Court has not said that, for

11

example, the judge's decision in Kalina and Malley to

12

issue the warrant broke the causal link between the

13

false testimony in the affidavits in those case.

14

though the judge was making an independent decision, the

15

Court recognized, as the common law recognized, that

16

there could be a causal chain back to the false

17

testimony which essentially tainted the decisionmaker,

18

the judge's decision, just as it taints the grand jury's

19

decision.

20

Even

And, in fact, what lower courts have said is

21

that it is only when there is an allegation of false

But, of course, that's the

We have on the one side, you

That was an arrest warrant, testimony
Then we have the
And

So, why should we

The -- the arrest warrant is certainly

MR. PINCUS:

Well, the first reason, Your

10

Honor, is because that's what the common law did.

11

what the Court's -- the Court's inquiry here is to look

12

at the common law and decide what Congress, when it

13

enacted the statute in 1871, confronted.

14

Congress enacted the statute in 1871, there were -- the

15

rule was that complaining witnesses who testified before

16

grand -- that grand jury testimony of people who were

17

complaining witnesses was not immunized as a basis for

18

malicious prosecution liability.

19

And

And when

What the Respondent is seeking here is to

20

say my grand jury testimony is immunized as a basis of

9

Well, could there be --

JUSTICE ALITO:

And could there be malicious

prosecution liability for a witness before a grand jury
who was not a, quote/unquote, "complaining witness"?

11

MR. PINCUS:

No, and that's the source of

12

the distinction that the Court drew in Malley and

13

Kalina.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, you're not really asking

15

us to adopt the common law rule, are you?

16

for a variation of the common law rule that's limited to

17

complaining witnesses.

18

you saying that no witness before a grand jury should

have absolute immunity from a so-called 1983 malicious

prosecution claim?

No, Your Honor, we're not.

22

We're asking for exactly the rule that was at common

law.

precisely the same distinction that we rely on here.

What the Court has said in Kalina and Malley is --

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if I understand your

about complaining witness is irrelevant.

witness before a grand jury has absolute immunity.

5

MR. PINCUS:

It's any -- no

No, Your Honor, it's

6

complaining witnesses.

The distinction that the common

7

law drew -- all witnesses were immune from defamation.

8

Only -- the only people who could be subject to

9

liability based on their testimony were people who

10

qualified as complaining witnesses.

That is why the

court in Malley and Kalina drew the line it did.

witness.

this affidavit is being a complaining witness.

Congress would have recognized in 1871 that there could

so --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

the only people who would be subject to suit for the

MR. PINCUS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Pincus, you -- in

10

answer to one of Justice Kagan's questions, you noted

11

that you really can't find a case where a court relied

12

exclusively on the grand jury testimony.

13

cases that I've reviewed, there's a discussion that both

14

non-grand jury and grand jury testimony was being relied

15

upon; is that accurate?

It's awfully hard to tell, but I wouldn't want

2

you have that would support a malicious prosecution

3

claim?

4

What would be the independent evidence that

MR. PINCUS:

Well, there -- there is

5

independent evidence in this case, Your Honor, of --

6

before the Respondent testified before the grand jury

7

there were -- there are allegations that he conspired

8

with the district attorney and others to fabricate the

9

evidence that he gave.

10

And that obviously --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, the court below

11

took that into account and said:

12

the grand jury testimony to prove the conspiracy, and

13

that's not enough.

14

MR. PINCUS:

You're only relying on

Well, Your Honor, I think that

15

what the Eleventh Circuit said was because this was all

16

directed to the grand jury testimony, we're not going to

17

separate -- uphold -- hold that there could be liability

18

based on that alone.

19

I think that's wrong for two reasons.

First

20

of all, our principal submission, of course, is there

21

can be liability premised on the grand jury testimony

22

and that there's no basis in the common law for a

23

different rule.

24

And our second position would be, even if

25

you, the Court, thought that grand jury testimony for
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

some reason was off limits but became permissible as a

2

basis for finding liability if there was other evidence,

3

then that's true in this case as well.

4

I want to return to Justice Breyer's

5

question for 1 minute, because there was the third

6

policy reason that I wanted to provide, which is, as we

7

explain in our brief, in the States many prosecutors can

8

proceed by information or indictment, and we think it

9

would be a peculiar situation if liability could be

10

premised when a proceeding is initiated by information,

11

which Malley and Kalina make clear, but that if the

12

proceeding is by grand jury, it would be wholly off

13

limits.

14

inconsistent with the common law rule.

That doesn't make much sense, and it's totally

15

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The way the Respondent sees it is the

23

extension of Briscoe into the absolute immunity for all

24

witnesses in the grand jury with no distinction with

25

respect to whether they are the complaining witness or
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

otherwise.

2

As this Court has said in Briscoe, that the

3

-- you look at the purpose of protecting the witnesses,

4

both at the grand jury proceeding and at trial, and you

5

want to preserve every man's evidence and you want to

6

keep the court from harassment --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You would acknowledge that

8

if someone instigates the grand jury proceeding but does

9

not testify, that person could be sued if indeed the

10

instigation was malicious?

11

MR. JONES:

If it's outside of the grand

12

jury -- and I go for the but-for test, unlike the Van de

13

Kamp --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, now, just answer my

15

question.

MR. JONES:

Yes, that person could be sued

20

under the but-for standard.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So, all he has to do

22

to get himself off the hook is, after instigating it, he

23

should testify, right?

24

is that it?

25

MR. JONES:

His testimony bathes him clean;

No, that isn't, because -28


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

So, then it --

2

so, all you're arguing, then, is that there has to be

3

some evidence other than the mere testimony; is that

4

your point?

5

MR. JONES:

That is my point.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. JONES:

Okay.

That there has to be some

8

evidence other than the mere testimony.

9

evidence other than the mere testimony, indeed you can

10

go forward with a 1983 claim.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if there is

Then you agree with the

12

-- with the position that the United States took, which

13

is you can -- if there were -- there was evidence

14

outside the grand jury proceeding that this person was

15

the instigator, that that could be the basis for a

16

malicious prosecution 1983 claim?

17

States' position was:

18

testimony before the grand jury, but if this person did

19

things outside the grand jury to instigate the

20

prosecution, that's -- that could --

21

MR. JONES:

I thought the United

We're not going to use the

The way I understand the

22

Solicitor General's position was that if the only way

23

that you could prove the allegation was to use the grand

24

jury testimony, then indeed you could not bring a suit

25

under 1983.

But I think as Justice Scalia's question
29

Alderson Reporting Company

was proffered is that it was an independent act that in

2

and of itself created a constitutional violation,

3

independent, and actually caused the prosecution.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But, Mr. Jones, you -Well, do you agree that we

7

should vacate and remand according to the suggestion of

8

the Solicitor General?

9

MR. JONES:

No, Your Honor.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MR. JONES:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And why is that?

Well -Is it just because of your

13

view of the evidence, that there's no evidence to

14

justify the remand?
MR. JONES:

15

Well, that's certainly one of

16

the issues.

17

Solicitor General is recommending, none of those issues

18

were raised below, none of those issues were raised in

19

the court of appeals in the Eleventh Circuit, and in

20

this --

21

But nothing like this was -- what the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you're saying that

22

this was waived and was just not in the case?

23

usually if the issue wasn't discussed, that's the reason

24

MR. JONES:

That's correct.

MR. JONES:

How was it waived?

It was never presented by any

side at any -- to any place in the court below.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but if -- if there

is -- if there is a theory of liability and we find that

9

there is -- that that theory is baseless, we don't

10

generally dismiss the complaint if there are other

11

allegations in the complaint that could support

12

liability on another theory.

Well, certainly, I mean, this

case has to be -- it's going back to the district court

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But at

Well, Mr. Jones, could I

19

understand your responses to these questions?

20

you said to Justice Scalia the fact that there's been

21

testimony at the grand jury does not, if you will,

22

immunize the person from suit based on other acts.

23

you go further?

24

the grand jury testimony come in as evidence?

25

Because

Can

In a suit based on other acts, could

MR. JONES:

If you look at common law,
31


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's exactly what happened.

At common law, and as

2

Justice Scalia mentioned in -- in his concurrence in

3

Kalina, what you had is two separate acts when you had a

4

malicious prosecution at common law.

5

actually complaining and making a complaint to -- to get

6

a warrant; in other words, swearing at that point in

7

time.

8

actually didn't have to be a witness.

The first act was

But there, again, the person that complained

9

But when he was a witness or when he or she

10

became a witness at court, that testimony could then be

11

used to show malice for the prosecution or for actually

12

bringing the case.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, all you're saying is

14

that there's absolute immunity for a suit based

15

exclusively on grand jury testimony, and if the suit is

16

based on something else, the grand jury testimony can

17

come in.

18

MR. JONES:

That is correct, if indeed it's

19

an independent cause of action outside of the court,

20

yes.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know what an

22

independent cause of action could be, because it is the

23

grand jury proceeding that initiates the action.

24

why would the common law permit it unless it recognized

that a complaining witness has to do something to get

our position with respect to the Solicitor General on

18

when you have something independent that forms a cause

19

of action, for example, if you take and plant evidence

20

in of a crime, for example cocaine or something of that

21

nature, that is a separate and distinct cause of action,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it different from -- I

2

mean, I find the Solicitor General -- it's my fault, I'm

3

sure -- I don't understand the position they're taking.

4

I mean, I think in every case there's some evidence

5

about what goes on outside the courtroom or the grand

6

jury room, and then there is some evidence about what

7

went on inside.

8

to introduce what.

9

And I don't know when you're supposed

So, I'm guessing that -- that whatever the

10

rule is about when you can use what parts of what, that

11

if you win, the rule about when you should use or when

12

you still can use the testimony that's given in the

13

grand jury room is the same as the rule that says when

14

you can use the testimony of a witness at trial.

15

See, I would have thought that immunity

16

means you can't use that testimony, but I'm told I'm

17

wrong about that.

18

don't know when you can use it and when you can't.

At least as I understand with

1

everything that's in Briscoe, as you know, is absolutely

2

immune from civil damage litigation.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

immune, I'm thinking of a typical case as follows:

someone and says:

Jones stole my horse.

Third step, he's in the grand jury room
saying:

Jones stole my horse.

11

Fourth, he's at trial.

12

Well, I -I'm at sea.

Whatever you

can help me with, I'd be happy.
MR. JONES:

First of all -- and it might be

18

a difficult time.

But the -- when you have a grand

19

jury, you have something different from just bringing a

20

cause of action.

21

have evidence presented to the prosecutor, typically a

22

district attorney, and then the district attorney makes

23

an independent evaluation as to what to bring to the

24

grand jury and who to indict or whether to indict

25

anybody whatsoever.

What you have in a grand jury is you

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That testimony in that grand jury -- if you

2

bring a cause of action, for example if a cause of

3

action is brought for malicious prosecution, which

4

they're trying to do here, what this Court has said in

5

the Van de Kamp case is that the only time that you can

6

use that testimony is if there is something else outside

7

of the grand jury --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
else.

There's always something

He didn't think of this thing for the first time

10

in the grand jury room.

11

thing outside the grand jury room before he even got to

12

the grand jury, and he probably told somebody about it,

13

or he could have, or at least there's the evidence he

14

walked to the grand jury room.

15

always something outside the grand jury.

16

MR. JONES:

The defendant thought of this

Sure.

Okay?

Sure.

So, there's

But the case law

17

says that if the prosecutor would not have taken the

18

case or would not have done the case but for the conduct

19

of that individual, then indeed you cannot bring the

20

cause of action.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

I have the same -- I have

22

the same concern as Justice Breyer.

23

ask the question in a different way.

Can you give me an example of a case in

2

done something outside of the grand jury that would be

sufficient to make out a claim of malicious prosecution?

4

If that situation doesn't exist, then I don't see any

5

difference between your position and Mr. Pincus's

6

position.

7

MR. JONES:

It does exist, because typically

8

when you have an investigation in any type of district

9

attorney's office, what you have is investigators going

10

out and investigating a case, bringing the material to

11

the district attorney, then the district attorney looks

12

at the material, and then the district attorney is the

one that makes an independent decision.

Would there be -- would there be absolute immunity then

17

for the affidavit that supports the accusation which

18

will begin the prosecution?

If I understand your question,

20

and I'm not sure I heard it exactly, are you saying if

21

there's an affidavit that went before the grand jury?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No.

We take the grand

jury out of it.

We're going to begin the case, the

prosecution, by an information, or I think the Georgia

25

law refers to something called an accusation.

we're not before a grand jury and the prosecution is

5

MR. JONES:

Once again, that's a scenario

6

essentially in Malley and Kalina, where you had those

7

individuals coming before -- they were not subpoenaed.

8

Those individuals -- whether it's affidavit or

9

testimony, I think either one is testimony.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

But you -- you cited a

11

provision of the Georgia Code that seems to equate

12

what's called an accusation with an indictment.

13

the bottom of page 22:

15

commencing with the return of the indictment or the

16

filing of the accusation."

It's on

somebody that is merely coming before the judge in the

hope of getting a warrant to issue.

doesn't -- isn't under the constraint of a prosecutor,

4

an independent prosecutor, in the meantime.

5

the person asking the questions, asking and actually

6

subpoenaing a witness for like a grand jury, that person

7

is actually -- and what the Court has said is

8

potentially wasting judicial resources by bringing a

9

not-so-good case, just like in Malley, to the court.

10

That person

Actually,

And so, to protect the court and to protect

11

the judicial process, the Court has said that person

12

only has qualified immunity so as to make him think and

13

make the process think before it happens, before they go

14

to the judge.

15

But in the grand jury scenario you have an

16

independent individual, in this case the prosecutor,

17

receiving the evidence and the prosecutor deciding what

18

cases to bring.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

down with the prosecutor in his office and telling him a

So, the distinction between the two is, as I

The person here is

No, the person here is the

investigator who's employed by the prosecutor.

And I

19

think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the prosecutor

himself in this situation directed the investigator to

21

appear before the grand jury, and directed him as to

22

what to testify to at the grand jury.

23

Honor pointed out, the -- who is absolutely immune, in

the grand jury setting the prosecutor is immune, the

grand jurors are immune.

So -- and as Your

what this Court has decided is intimately associated

MR. JONES:

complaint alleges Mr. Paulk and Mr. Hodges, acting under

Why isn't that sufficient to support a claim

14

of so-called malicious prosecution without regard to the

15

evidentiary -- without regard to the grand jury

16

testimony?

17

MR. JONES:

Because -- just because they

act was completed until after, in this case, Mr. Hodges

me that you have accepted a good deal of Mr. Pincus's

case.

13

somebody based on acts outside of court, that the grand

14

jury testimony can come in as evidence in that action,

15

and all you're saying is that there's -- there's no way

16

to bring this action in this case because your client

17

didn't in fact do anything.

You've said that you can bring an action against

No.

And perhaps that's not my

19

position.

First of all, I'm not saying that they're --

20

what I'm saying with respect to bringing a malicious

21

prosecution claim is that -- I think Justice Scalia

22

asked me if there is a completely independent act, but

23

if -- in the scenario that you paint, just the fact that

24

they've talked outside the grand jury, that does not

25

authorize an independent cause of action for a malicious

prosecution claim.

2

What you have to have is an independent act,

3

just like what you had at common law where you had two

common law said, you became the complaining witness even

1

A couple of points.

First of all, the --

2

the question about whether there -- it's an appropriate

3

rule that a finding of complaining witness can be based

4

on evidence outside of the grand jury, but it can't be

5

based on grand jury testimony, that certainly wasn't the

6

common law rule.

7

whether there were any common law cases that relied

8

solely on grand jury testimony.

9

are hard to parse, I would point the Court to the

And I note Justice Sotomayor asked

And although the cases

10

Anderson and the Moulton cases that we cite on page 3 of

11

our reply brief.

12

the Court is talking about the charge to the jury, and

13

what it says the evidence was is the fact that the

14

defendant was listed as the complainant on the

15

indictment and that he testified before the grand jury.

16

And then in the Moulton case, the allegations of the

17

complaint are set forth in the reporting of the case,

18

and the only allegations are -- relate to the testimony

19

before the grand jury.

20

In those cases, in the Anderson case,

So, I think it's very hard to find any basis

21

in the common law, which as the Court said -- has said

22

is the controlling principle here, for ruling the grand

23

jury testimony either entirely out of bounds as a basis

24

for liability or for saying it's only in bounds if there

25

is some other extrinsic evidence.

There's just no

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

support for that in the common law, and I think it

2

doesn't really make sense -- if this case had proceeded

3

by information and Mr. Paulk's grand jury testimony had

4

simply been placed in an affidavit and submitted in

5

order to obtain the arrest warrant, Malley and Kalina

6

would control, and it would be clear that there would be

7

liability --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose this was a

jurisdiction that didn't have grand juries but returned

Would a witness at a preliminary hearing have absolute

MR. PINCUS:

A -- a complaining witness, I

don't think -- if that is the proceeding that sets

is -- are some set of people that you -- that you could
