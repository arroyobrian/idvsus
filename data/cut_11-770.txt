ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you,


Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

In Michigan v. Summers, this Court

10
11

established a categorical exception to the default

12

Fourth Amendment requirement of probable cause.

13

Under Summers, officers executing a search

14

warrant for contraband may detain individuals they

15

encounter at the scene while they are in the course of

16

executing the warrant.

17

This case presents the question whether the

18

Summers exception also permits officers to detain

19

individuals who have left the scene before the warrant

20

is executed.

21

scene do not pose an immediate threat to the safe and

22

efficient completion of the search, the court of appeals

23

erred by permitting their detention absent probable

24

cause or even individualized suspicion.

25

should therefore be reversed.

Because individuals who have left the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, the two tests,

2

yours seem to be the immediate vicinity test, and the

3

Second Circuit is as soon as practical test.

4

adversaries point out that the Second Circuit test

5

actually focuses on the police officer's conduct, which

6

should be the focus of reasonableness or

7

unreasonableness.

8

line that is subject to as much play as the other.

9

isn't the focus on police conduct the right focus?

10

Your

Your test just creates an artificial

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Why

Well, let me explain,

11

Justice Sotomayor, first, the sort of theoretical basis

12

for why we're offering this line, and, second, say a

13

word about the comparative merits of the two tests.

14

First of all, with regard to the theoretical

15

basis for the line, our fundamental submission to this

16

Court is that Summers does not create a police

17

entitlement; it is instead a rule of necessity and

18

should be confined to situations in which a detention

19

serves search-related purposes.

20

And in our view, the justifications for a

21

detention evaporate once an individual has left the

22

immediate vicinity of the premises.

23

because in those circumstances a detention serves no

24

interest in ensuring the safe and efficient completion

25

of the search because the individual poses no immediate

threat to the safe and efficient completion of the

search.

JUSTICE KAGAN:
vicinity?

5

And what is the immediate


How would you define that?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, ordinarily, the


6

immediate vicinity will be the physical bounds of the


7

property; but, there may be circumstances in which an


8

individual who is just outside the physical bounds of


9

the property should nevertheless be detained, so to


10

provide --

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:
is.

May be?

There certainly

I mean, that was Summers, wasn't it?

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, in Summers itself, the

14

individual was on the premises just outside the house

15

that was going to be searched, and the officers were, in

16

the government's words in that case, approaching the

17

property.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

premises, he was on the sidewalk, right?

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

He wasn't on the

Well, he was actually on --

21

he was on the property because he was on a sidewalk that

22

connected the front steps to the public sidewalk in

23

front of the house.

24

house, about to effectuate entry.

25

The officers were approaching the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

the house.

2
3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

He was pretty clearly within

the curtilage, Justice Scalia.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You said the

5

difference is there's no immediate threat to the

6

officers here.

7

mean, if he finds out about the search and comes back,

8

if he sees the officers outside his dwelling, if there's

9

somebody in the dwelling who can notify him, send him a

But there is a threat, I suppose, I

10

message that the police are searching and he can get his

11

confederates and come back.

12

It seems to me that you're requiring that

13

there be a larger number of police present at the site

14

conducting the search, being lookouts for anybody that

15

might come back, being able to detain people who are

16

leaving as they approach.

17

but there's certainly a threat.

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There's no immediate threat,

If anything, it's the

19

government's approach that requires a greater number of

20

officers at the site because, under the government's

21

approach, you have the two officers who conduct the

22

detention while a separate group of officers execute the

23

search.

24
25

And it's really for that reason,
Justice Scalia -6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it requires

2

more unless they want the guy to get away, I guess,

3

right?

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, let me say something

5

about this prospect that the individual will return.

6

think that the appropriate analysis here is the analysis

7

that this Court set out in Arizona v. Gant.

8
9

We

And this Court, in Arizona v. Gant,
suggested that where a categorical rule is involved, you

10

have to look at the class of cases to which the rule

11

would be extended to see if the justifications apply.

12

Now, with regard to this class of

13

individuals who have left the scene, we believe that it

14

is simply unlikely either that such an individual who

15

has left the scene will be aware of the presence of

16

police, or that such an individual will return in an

17

effort to disrupt the search.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what if he were aware,

19

or what if there was reason to think he might be aware,

20

would you then allow the police to do what the police

21

did here?

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we wouldn't.

And

23

that's simply because we believe that this should be a

24

categorical analysis.

25

And so, again, you're looking at this entire
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

class of cases where individuals have left the scene to

2

determine whether the justifications for the Summers

3

rule apply.

4

Now, let me provide a --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If -- if you think that

6

leaving the scene -- in Justice Kagan's hypothetical,

7

that he's leaving the scene with incriminating evidence,

8

at that point you have -- you have a Terry stop?

9

he's right at the scene; he's just leaving the premises,

10

And

at the end of the driveway or something?

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, the analysis under

12

Terry is whether there is reasonable suspicion, a

13

reasonable basis to believe that the individual is

14

engaged in criminal activity -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

What would you think

16

generally in my hypothetical?

17

other facts, but --

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There'd be hundreds of

Well, ordinarily, when an

19

individual is seen leaving the scene -- and suppose --

20

let me provide --

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just -- just before the

search, yes.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, of course, the

24

individual who is leaving the scene doesn't necessarily

25

know that the search is about to take place.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Right.
And so, to provide a

3

hypothetical that will hopefully put some meat on the

4

bones of this issue, suppose that an individual leaves a

5

house, and he actually sees police officers sitting in a

6

car, whether marked or unmarked, outside the house.

7

it is clear that he has seen the officers.

8

the officers and then ambles down the street.

9

And

He waves at

I don't think that there would be any doubt

10

but that that individual could not be detained unless he

11

did something more; unless, for instance, he engaged in

12

flight at that point, at which point he could perhaps be

13

detained under Terry.

14

And so we simply submit that the analysis

15

should be no different in a situation in which the

16

purpose -- the reason why the officers are sitting

17

outside the house is because another group of officers

18

is about to execute the search warrant.

19

Of course, that individual --

22

but it was raised.

23

But Terry -- Terry is an

It wasn't decided below,

So -- so you're arguing we shouldn't extend

24

Summers, but that leaves this very case susceptible to

25

the assertion that this was a legitimate Terry stop.
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is correct,

Justice Ginsburg.

3

And just to be clear about how these two

4

doctrines work together, our submission to this Court is

5

that within the search zone, within the immediate

6

vicinity of the premises, the rule of Summers applies,

7

so that, if officers encounter an individual within that

8

zone while they are in the process of executing the

9

warrant, a detention is permissible absent probable

10

cause or individualized suspicion.

11

Outside that search zone, ordinary

12

Fourth Amendment principles apply.

13

under the Fourth Amendment, detentions of persons have

14

to be justified by some degree of individualized

15

suspicion; probable cause for a full-fledged arrest,

16

individualized suspicion for a more limited detention

17

under Terry.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

And, of course,

Well, what would you think

19

of this situation?

20

and they're -- they're at the house.

21

come out the door and start to go down the steps,

22

doesn't look like that person has noticed their

23

presence.

24
25

Officers have a no-knock warrant,
They see somebody

Now, they have the choice, if you prevail,
of either rushing in and stopping the person within the
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

curtilage, in which case they could detain the person,

2

or they could allow the person to walk some distance

3

outside of the site of the house and then stop the

4

person, and that would allow them to execute the warrant

5

without endanger -- without enhancing the danger to them

6

from potentially armed people inside or allowing the

7

destruction of evidence.

8
9

What -- in that situation, what argues in
favor of your rule, that if they want to detain this

10

individual, they have to rush in and stop him before he

11

leaves the premises?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The justifications

13

articulated by this Court in Summers, Justice Alito, and

14

in particular what we really believe are the primary

15

justifications, first, minimizing the risk of harm to

16

officers executing the warrant; and, second,

17

facilitating the orderly completion of the search.

18

And let me say a word about --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, without

20

interrupting -- in that situation, officer safety is

21

undermined by your rule because it requires them to stop

22

the person on the premises and, therefore, tip off those

23

inside, potentially, about their presence.

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But they also have the

choice not to engage in a detention at all.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And I think the fundamental problem with the

2

court of appeals' rule and with the government's

3

submission to this Court is that it really entails the

4

conclusion that once officers see the individual leaving

5

the house, they have an entitlement to detain that

6

individual, with the only open question being where and

7

how they go about effectuating the detention.

8
9

But we simply believe that the
justifications for the detention don't attach to the

10

individual.

11

the mere fact that an individual is seen leaving a house

12

that is about to be searched in our view is insufficient

13

to give rise to reasonable suspicion.

14

They are search-based justifications.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Mr. Shanmugam, when you talk

15

about the justifications in your brief and just now, you

16

talk about two; but, there were, in fact, three, and the

17

third was flight.

18

your understanding of Summers?

19

So how is it that that's dropped from

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we simply think,

20

Justice Kagan, that that justification is insufficient

21

standing on its own.

22

justification in preventing flight is different in kind

23

from the other two justifications that we've been

24

discussing.

25

And that is simply because the

The other two justifications are truly
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

special law enforcement interests, to use this Court's

2

words in Summers.

3

contrast, is an ordinary law enforcement interest.

4

The interest in preventing flight, by

And just as in my hypothetical, when the

5

officers are sitting outside and they see an individual

6

wander by, the mere fact that the individual saw the

7

police and perhaps would therefore conclude that the

8

police were on to him would not give rise to a basis for

9

detention simply because that individual could

10

subsequently flee.

11

So, too, we think that preventing flight in

12

and of itself is insufficient.

13

enforcement interest that requires individualized

14

suspicion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

That is the ordinary law

Counsel, can I come back

16

to the facts that my colleagues have raised and break it

17

down implicating the Terry question?

18

Here, the officers had a report of something

19

in the house, and they saw the defendant -- two people

20

leaving.

21

I know Terry hasn't been decided, but why do

22

you think -- just the stop, not the detention, not the

23

bringing them back to the house, why do you think that

24

just stopping them was wrong?

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Under Terry?

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Under Terry.

Sure.

Well, and first of

3

all, I should preface what I'm about to say by noting

4

that the court of appeals itself didn't reach the Terry

5

issue, and the government doesn't advance that issue in

6

its merits brief.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9
10

But the court below did.

So that would be an issue

that would be open on remand.

And let me say why on

remand --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Just the

12

stop would be -- but -- but they did more than just stop

13

them.

14
15

They -MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that's right.

The

stop and the --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- they handcuffed them.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it goes back to if

18

a police officer saw an individual leaving the house and

19

was concerned about them tipping someone off, et cetera,

20

what would be the problem with the officer stopping the

21

person around the corner, holding them, making sure

22

people got in and then letting them go.

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And just to be clear,

24

because there are the two separate issues.

25

question of the stop and the question of the detention.
14

Alderson Reporting Company

There's the

Official

1

And there would be a separate question about whether

2

under Terry a detention of a particular length might or

3

might not be permissible.

4

But as to the stop, the argument that we

5

would make on remand if we were to prevail before this

6

Court would be that here what you have is insufficient

7

to meet the reasonable suspicion standard.

8

assume that the government would argue is that the

9

combination of the search warrant and the fact that the

And what I

10

individual was seen leaving the premises that were about

11

to be searched, and as to which there was probable cause

12

to believe that contraband was present, and the fact

13

that my client met the extremely generic description

14

provided by the confidential informant, would be

15

sufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion.

16

Now, clearly we don't think -- I was just

17

going to say, clearly we don't think that either of

18

those factors standing on its own would be sufficient.

19

The question would be whether that combination of

20

factors under the facts and circumstances of this case

21

would be sufficient, and we would submit that that

22

combination is insufficient as well.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If they did do -- if they

24

did do a Terry stop, and in the process of that stop the

25

police officer got a call that said, we found lots of
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contraband, guns in this house, at that point they could

2

have turned the Terry stop into an arrest, couldn't

3

they?

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

They could very well, with

5

one caveat, and that caveat is simply that the

6

circumstances under which the contraband is found might

7

be relevant to the analysis of whether or not there is

8

probable cause, because the question would be whether or

9

not there is probable cause to believe that the

10

individual constructively possessed the contraband at

11

issue.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Shanmugam, please help

So what do you do?

I

You -- you slice the

Oh, yes, he later went on to detain

MR. SHANMUGAM:

What -- what relevance does

Well, that would be the

23

additional question, whether the detention in this case,

24

which did involve taking my client and the other

25

individual, putting them in handcuffs, putting them in
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the patrol car, and then taking them back to the scene,

2

was permissible within the scope of a Terry stop.

3

think that would also be an open question, and that

4

would particularly be an open question in a number of

5

these cases in which the detention, pursuant seemingly

6

to Summers, occurs over a very lengthy period of time.

7

Under Terry, of course --

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I

Well, I guess -- I guess, I

just didn't realize that it's an open question whether
you can do that much in -- in a mere Terry stop.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, under Terry officers

12

may detain an individual for the period of time it takes

13

for them to confirm or dispel the suspicion, and I think

14

that there would be an open question as to whether or

15

not when officers are executing a search warrant, for

16

the duration of the execution of the search warrant,

17

that falls within the scope of that Terry test.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you explain what you

19

mean by the immediate vicinity?

20

property line?

21

the entrance to the premises?

22

you could see from the -- the site of the search?

23

Is it based on -- on

Is it some absolute distance from the --

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Is it based on how far

I think ordinarily it will

24

be within the physical bounds of the property.

25

but -- but if, for instance, officers saw an individual

So --

Official

1

coming out of his house and he walked out and he just

2

happened to step -- step off the curb into the road

3

before the officers got to them, we would say that that

4

would satisfy the immediate vicinity standard.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, physical bounds of

6

the property is -- is too much.

I mean, you know, what

7

if it's a farm and it's a 50-acre farm?

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, and the point of -I think you are much better

10

off, I think your submissions sometimes say immediate

11

vicinity.

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we -- we proposed to

13

this Court the immediate vicinity standard in large part

14

because it really is comparable to similar limits this

15

Court has adopted for other Fourth Amendment --

16
17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I like that much better

than boundaries of the property.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well -- and to provide a

19

couple of examples, under Maryland v. Buie, the case

20

that permits officers to conduct a protective sweep

21

incident to an arrest, the Court permits officers to

22

search the area immediately adjoining the place where

23

the arrest occurs and that has not proven to be a

24

difficult standard to apply in practice.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the actual

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

difference?

2

they go into the property and somebody's there, they can

3

detain him, and Summers gives three reasons:

4

Justice Kagan pointed out, preventing flight in the

5

event that incriminating evidence is found.

6

considering now the case where, instead of going and

7

detaining the people, the people inside the house walk

8

out and there are two officers in a patrol car or an

9

unmarked car outside waiting to go in.

10

I mean, you have two officers or three.

If

One, as

Okay.

We are

That

seems to me identical, as you said.

11

The last one is facilitating orderly

12

completion of the search.

That seems to me identical.

13

You want the person there so that he can open a drawer,

14

so he can unlock a closet, et cetera, okay.

Identical.

The third one, where there is the only place

15
16

for difference, it seems to me, is minimizing the risk

17

of harm to the officers.

18

the officers I guess if he goes into the house is that,

change, and what about the second?

13

I don't see how the third one could

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I actually don't think

14

that even the first one is identical.

15

think that first and foremost, the interest in ensuring

16

officer safety is really the paramount interest here,

17

and we simply think that it is unlikely that an

individual who is seen leaving the scene is either going

Well, and that was going to

11

be my next point, Justice Sotomayor; and the government

12

really tries to make a broader and more ambitious

13

argument.

14

that an individual with a connection to the place to be

15

searched could arrive at the scene while the search is

16

ongoing, really regardless of whether that individual

17

was aware of the presence of police, and then seek to

18

disrupt the search.

19

The government tries to make the argument

Now, we think even as to that broader

20

category of cases the government hasn't made a

21

sufficient showing that those sorts of confrontations

22

are a common occurrence, particularly in light of the

23

routine precautions --

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I haven't personally

11

that with regard to categorical rules it is really

13

an extension of a categorical rule is required.

Yes, the precaution

3

is let's wait until he's a block down the street because

4

5

by Summers or not?

6

Can they do that and be covered

MR. SHANMUGAM:

They cannot be covered by

7

Summers, but what they can do is either follow the

8

individual for the period of time during which they are

9

executing the warrant, or they can detain that

10
11

individual if he returns to the scene.
And again, all of the examples that the

12

government cites -- and there aren't that many of

13

them -- but the examples that the government cites are

14

examples of individuals who arrive at the scene and when

15

they realize that their place of residence is being

16

searched, they become obstreperous; and to the extent

17

that there is a concern about the threat posed to the

18

safety of officers in those circumstances, we would

19

submit that the obvious solution is to make clear that

20

Summers permits the detention of individuals who arrive

21

at the scene; and officers routinely do establish

22

perimeters when they are executing search warrants.

23

so when they --

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

So if he came back -- I

mean, the scenario here is he was supposed to be driving
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

his friend home, and he would have come back while the

2

search was ongoing, but the police could apprehend

3

anyone while the search -- if that's what you're saying,

4

while the search is ongoing --

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, if he were to return

6

to the scene while the search is ongoing, we believe

7

that he could be detained pursuant to Summers, and we

8

cite a number of court of appeals cases that have so

9

held.

10

What the government is really arguing for

11

here is an even more ambitious rule, an additional layer

12

of Fourth Amendment prophylaxis, if you will, that

13

permits officers to detain an individual who is seen

14

leaving the scene based on the possibility that they are

15

going to return.

16

to making an empirical case as to why that additional

17

layer of prophylaxis is required.

18

The government has not come even close

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what if the person

19

comes out the door and walks -- and has walked 50 feet

20

down the block within sight of the entrance at the time

21

when the police are entering to make the arrest?

22

that person be in the immediate vicinity?

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Would

Well, I think that the

24

natural limit on the immediate vicinity rule is imposed

25

by the underlying justification, namely, that officers
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

should have the authority to encounter individuals -- to

2

detain individuals they encounter while they are in the

3

course of executing the warrant.

4

And so if in your hypothetical,

5

Justice Alito, the search team is marching up to the

6

house, and they encounter the individual 50 feet away

7

from the door or the property line while they are in the

8

course of doing so, the justifications of Summers kick

9

in at that point.

That individual is aware of the fact

10

that the police are about to search his house, and, as

11

such, that individual poses a threat to the safe and

12

efficient completion of the search.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, does that mean that if

14

the person is within sight of the entrance to the

15

premises at the time when the police enter, then that

16

person can be searched --

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we don't think --

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- and be detained.

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We don't think that that's

20

necessarily a line of sight rule.

21

individual who was sitting out in front of a house six

22

doors down, we don't think that that individual could be

23

detained.

24

detained at least seven-tenths of a mile away --

25

So if you had an

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the problem.

The

3

police have to know what they're supposed to do when

4

they go in to search a house, all right?

5

that sometimes they can keep the people there, and you

6

are saying, but they can't stop them from leaving if

7

they're not -- all of a sudden, I'm a policeman, and I

8

don't know what to do exactly because I don't know how

9

to fill in that blank.

And they know

And therefore, I might rush

10

in -- I don't know -- I see a recipe for a mess, and

11

that's what -- and the mess could involve physical harm,

12

and --

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

You're missing the --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're not saying that they

15

can't stop them from leaving.

16

can't stop them from leaving?

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have you said that; they

They can't stop them from

leaving if, blank.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

They -- they could always

20

proceed to execute the warrant when they see an

21

individual leaving; and, if they are in the course of

22

executing the warrant, a detention is permissible.

23

But let me say just one word about the issue

24

of the administrability of the rule because, after all,

25

what we're talking about here is a bright-line rule.
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And the very purpose of a Fourth Amendment bright-line

2

rule is to provide guidance to courts and officers

3

alike.

4

It is true that one can posit difficult

5

hypotheticals under our immediate vicinity standard;

6

but, it is also true that it is even easier to posit

7

difficult hypotheticals under the as soon as reasonably

8

practicable standard that the government advances, which

9

really reintroduces the very case-by-case analysis that

10

bright-line rules are designed to avoid.

11

And, in addition, it is entirely unclear to

12

us what Fourth Amendment purpose that limitation serves

13

because it is not clear to us why it matters for Fourth

14

Amendment purposes how quickly officers effectuate the

15

detention.

16

And just one last point that I'd like to

17

make before reserving the balance of my time for

18

rebuttal.

19

The rule that the government seems to be

20

advocating before this Court is really a much more

21

ambitious rule than we've even been discussing this

22

morning.

23

government has the authority to detain any individual

24

with a connection to the place to be searched.

25

think that that is out of recognition that an individual

The government seems to suggest that the

5

extension of the rule that this Court announced in

6

Summers.

And I would like to reserve the balance of
my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Mr. Wall, would you

answer -- direct your first response to that last issue

17

because, as I read your brief, you seem not to be

18

accepting the Second Circuit's rule at all.

19

be proposing what appears to me to be a much broader

20

rule that says -- at one point in your brief you state

21

that it is the occupant's observed connection to a home

22

subject to a valid warrant, not his physical location at

23

the time that he is detained, that makes him subject to

24

detention.

25

You seem to

warrants often have an advance team that has been

5

12 hours later.

6

And they've got

Is it your position that in that

7

circumstance the officers are authorized to go to

8

wherever the defend -- wherever the occupant is, the

9

office, the -- wherever he might be, his mother's home,

10

and effect an arrest there?

11

MR. WALL:

No, Justice Sotomayor.

I

12

appreciate the opportunity to start there because I

13

think Petitioner's reply brief and much of his argument

14

today is devoted to a position the government's not

15

taking.

16

So let me be very clear.

In the

17

government's view, Summers is about current and recent

18

occupants, people whom police, when they are executing

19

the warrant, find at the home or see leaving the home in

20

the process of executing a warrant.

21

And the question here is do the

22

justifications apply equally as a departing occupant

23

steps away from the home and onto a sidewalk, a yard, a

24

couple blocks away.

25

And I think my friend's answer to that has a
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

wonderfully abstract quality to it that doesn't engage

2

any of the realities on the ground.

They stop him.

He secures the dog, and they complete the

I think that is a model law enforcement

15

practice, and it is indistinguishable in any important

16

respect from what went on in Summers.

17

The justifications for detention apply

18

equally to departing occupants when they are seen by

19

officers leaving in the process of executing the

20

warrant.

21

But no, Justice Sotomayor, the government is

22

not contending that other connections to the residence,

23

other than that kind of observed connection by the

24

officers, could justify a detention under Summers.

them is not at all like the situation with the dog and

19

the armed guy just off the property.
MR. WALL:

20

Mr. Chief Justice, I respectfully

21

disagree.

And the government would be happy to have

22

this case decided by having the Court look at the

23

Federal and state cases, look at the risks that are

24

present in those cases, and deciding whether the

25

interests of Summers are served in those cases.

What we see in the cases is that -- take

But think how formalistic and odd

12

that is, Justice Ginsburg, that the police see someone

leaving, but, if they can't catch up to them on the

bounds of the property, which has no reasonable

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

they're conducting a search, post guards to prevent

24

people from coming in.

MR. WALL:

They often do, Justice Scalia,
32


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

but --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume they always do.

3

It seems to me there's no special threat from the person

4

who -- who left the house.

5

somebody else coming into the house.

6

MR. WALL:

There's always a threat of

Justice Scalia, certainly in

7

urban areas they do.

I think it's more difficult where

8

you have smaller police departments in rural areas.

9

But the government's not disputing that

10

posting sentries is a good idea.

That doesn't begin to

11

take care of the most serious cases, where people

12

outside of the area of the search fire on or assault

13

officers.

14

So, for instance, in 2008 --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're missing the

16

point, which is that's going to happen regardless,

17

meaning that risk exists whether the person left the

18

minute you got there or a minute before or an hour

19

before or two hours before.

20

which is the risk is extant no matter what.

21

MR. WALL:

That's the whole point,

Justice Sotomayor, there is no

22

question that executing a warrant is dangerous, and

23

people can come onto the scene at any time.

24
25

The question is, do we want to increase that
risk to officers?

Here, Petitioner is leaving, he'll be
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

back in a matter of minutes, and they're searching for

2

guns.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you didn't know --

4

you don't know that in any search, meaning any time you

5

do a search you have no idea when the -- whether the

6

occupant -- sometimes you know whether the occupant is

7

inside.

8

often you don't, and you don't know if someone will come

9

back and when.

You'll hear the TV or something else.

MR. WALL:

10
11

Justice Sotomayor, I completely

agree, although I think that --

12
13

But

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why is seeing someone

leaving increasing that risk?

14

MR. WALL:

Because we know that some

15

percentage of those people will come back.

16

percentage will flee, which is one of the interests in

17

Summers, which I think Petitioner does not take

18

seriously.

19

and some percentage of those returning occupants will

20

harm officers.

21

Some

But some percentage of them will come back

And unfortunately --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If -- if you have a large

22

enough force that you can afford to send two of them in

23

a car chasing this fellow for a mile, why can't you just

24

post those two outside the house, just in case somebody,

25

whether it's this person who's just left or anybody
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

else, comes back?

2

that what your positing is -- is -- is unlikely, namely,

3

having -- having sufficient personnel to follow these

4

persons, but not having sufficient personnel to defend

5

the premises against somebody entering.

6

I mean, it -- it seems to me that --

MR. WALL:

Justice Scalia, first, that isn't

7

even arguably going to serve two of the three Summers

8

interests, preventing people from fleeing or garnering

9

their assistance in the orderly completion of the

10

search.

But even if we -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

person who's just leaving in the normal act, without

17

reasonable suspicion?

18

MR. WALL:

You certainly are entitled

Justice Sotomayor, I think your

19

question fills in the answer.

What the Court said in

Summers is when you see someone -- when you find someone

21

at a home or you see them leaving at a time when a

22

neutral magistrate has determined there's probable cause

23

to believe a crime is being committed inside, you have,

24

in the words of the Summers Court, "articulable and

25

individualized suspicion" to believe that that person is

linked to the criminal activity inside the home.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Wall, you have

that, too, about the person in her workplace, and you

said that your argument didn't apply to the person in

her workplace.

better than that.

I think you're right that some of the arguments that the

25

Court adopted in Summers and that the government is

making here could translate.

And I think when those

cases come to the Court, the Court will have to decide

approves is seeing someone leaving a home subject to a

7

valid warrant for contraband.

8

connection at issue here.

But that's not what Summers is

The connection that Summers discusses and

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the only

But is it in the process?

10

Does Summers apply and does this apply only when the

11

police are in the process of executing a valid search

12

warrant?

13

MR. WALL:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

Even

14

Petitioner, the way I read his briefs, concedes that if

15

police had caught him outside the basement apartment or

16

somewhere within the property bounds --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- if the police

18

executing the valid search warrant walked through the

19

gate and at that moment the individual emerging from the

20

house had not yet passed through the gate, then under

21

Summers the police would have the right to detain him.

22

All right.

So the question here is he's

walked through the gate.

MR. WALL:

I mean,

Justice Ginsburg, I think the

for -- for current and recent occupants as a class,

12

we -- officers see, they find or see them at a residence

committed, so across the board we've got reasonable

suspicion, and that's why we draw a rule so that we're

16

not going to rebalance every time.

4

-- it seems to me that what's reasonable under the

Amendment requires a warrant to contain, and what a

7

warrant must contain is a description of the place to be

8

searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

rule which says once you have a warrant that this place

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:
Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Just -- just a couple of points.
First of all, having suggested in its brief

10
11

that the police may detain any individual with a

12

connection to the place to be searched under Summers,

13

the government today falls back to the view that the

14

police may detain any individual with an observed

15

connection, suggesting that this Court can leave for

16

another day the question of whether to detain people

17

with a certain but non-observed connection.

18

Leaving that aside, the government suggests

19

on at least five occasions today that that observed

20

connection is sufficient to give rise to reasonable

21

suspicion.

22

adopted its categorical rule in Summers.

23

been, the discussion of the special law enforcement

24

interests supporting the rule would have been entirely

25

superfluous.

That was not the basis on which this Court

58

Alderson Reporting Company

If it had

Official

1

And it's for that reason we would


2

respectfully submit that the Court made clear in


3

footnote 19 that Summers permits officers to detain


4

individuals regardless of the quantum of proof


5

justifying the detention of specific individuals.

6

And this Court's subsequent cases applying

7

Summers have made clear that Summers permits the

8

detention of individuals with no apparent connection to

9

the criminal activity being investigated.
And that leads into my second point, which

10
11

is that Terry will serve as a fallback in many of these

12

cases to permit detentions of individuals who are seen

13

leaving the premises, where there is a sufficient

14

additional basis to give rise to reasonable suspicion.

15

In fact, it may very well be the exception to the rule

16

that you have a case in which there aren't sufficient

17

additional articulable facts to give rise to reasonable

18

suspicion.

19

We would respectfully submit that this case

20

falls within that exceptional category, but it really

21

underscores why the expansion of Summers that the

22

government is seeking is really unnecessary.

23

I would just note, in response to a point

24

that Justice Scalia made, that the fundamental flaw with

25

the government's position is that it really can't be
59

Alderson Reporting Company

1

reconciled with any original understanding of the Fourth

2

Amendment.

3

that officers at the time of the founding or thereafter,

4

when executing search warrants, detained the occupants

5

of the premises.

6

There's no historical evidence suggesting

And the problem with the government's

7

approach is that it really would convert any search

8

warrant into a search and seizure warrant.

9

really would suggest that there is a freestanding right

JUSTICE ALITO:

What -- would you say the

same thing about the exact situation in Summers?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

No, we wouldn't,

Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:

You think the original

19

understanding was that what happened in Summers was

20

okay, but if you get out of the immediate vicinity,

21

that's where they drew the line?

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We're not challenging the

23

rule of Summers itself.

We're simply suggesting that

24

there's no historical basis for that rule, and for that

25

reason we think that any expansion of Summers would
60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

really be of questionable validity.

2

the detention was truly incident to the execution of the

3

warrant because, after all, the officers were

4

approaching the house and literally just about to

5

effectuate entry when the detention took place.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In Summers itself,

Well, you can say there was

7

a historical basis for the rule, in that officers have

8

always been allowed to take necessary action to protect

9

themselves.

And that's the principal justification.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

10

Perhaps, but we have been

11

unable to find any examples of detentions of occupants

12

of the premises until at least 1880.

13

simply that the detention ceases to be truly incident to

14

the search where the individual has left the scene.

15

justifications for the detention evaporate at that

16

point.

And our point is
