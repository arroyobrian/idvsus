 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

next this morning in Case 141096, Torres v. Lynch.
 Mr. Guadagno.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW L. GUADAGNO
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
 Congress made a choice. 

Congress did not

11

choose to make generic arson an aggravated felony.

12

Instead, Congress chose to make Federal arson an

13

aggravated felony.

14

 And that makes sense. 

The Federal arson

15

statute has a minimum sentence of five years.  There are

16

at least 18 States with arson offenses that are

17

classified as misdemeanors.  Arizona and Colorado have

18

misdemeanor arson offenses involving damage to property

19

worth less than a hundred dollars.

20

 Congress would not have wanted to make such

21

minor offenses aggravated felonies.  We know this

22

because of the statutory scheme.

23

 Within the aggravated felony statute, we

24

have generic offenses, very serious ones like murder and

25

rape.  There are no  there are no sentence

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

4
1

requirements for those very serious generic offenses.

2

 However, for the remaining generic offenses

3

that are  that are listed in  in  in the

4

aggravated felony statute, they  they are associated

5

with a sentence of a year or more.  Theft offenses,

6

obstruction of justice, burglary, they all require a

7

sentence of a year or more.

8
9
10
11

 Also listed with  among the generic
offenses is crime of violence.  There is a requirement
of a sentence of a year or more.
 Arson is a crime of violence, and so  so

12

Congress would have realized that  that arson offenses

13

would  would fall under the crimeofviolence

14

provision, and  and for more serious State arson

15

offenses, they would fall under this  this  this

16

provision so that, for the minor arson offenses, where

17

there's a sentence of less than a year, the individual

18

would  would not be an aggravated felon and would be

19

eligible for discretionary relief.

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But your reading leaves

21

out some very serious arson offenses.  Say under foreign

22

law or under State law it could be the worst kind of

23

arson, but there's no commerce hooker and so it would be

24

left out, on your reading.

25

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

But  but  but on  on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

5
1

our reading, while  while it wouldn't fall under

2

the  the  the (e) provision in the aggravated felony

3

statute, these more serious arson offenses, the  the

4

State and foreign offenses, they  they would fall

5

under the  the (f), crime of violence, provision

6

where  where there is a sentence to a year or more.

7

 And  and under  under that  that

8

approach, these lessserious arsons would  would not

9

be aggravated felons.  And  and individuals like 

10

like my client, Mr. Luna, who only received a sentence

11

of one day, they would be eligible to receive

12

cancelation of a 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you think that's still

clear after our decision in Johnson?
 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Johnson, if I  if I

16

remember correctly, dealt  dealt with  with  with

17

16  16(b).  You could still  you  one could still

18

be an aggravated felon under  under 16(a).  But  but

19

regardless, what I'm talking about is 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But what you're relying

21

is  you're relying on language that is similar to,

22

maybe, and  and maybe different in an  in an

23

important respect; but nevertheless bears some

24

similarity to the residual clause in the  in the armed

25

criminal  Armed Career Criminal Act, does it not?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

6
1

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Yes.  But I'm talking about

2

what Congress intended.  When Congress write  writes a

3

law, it doesn't intend for  for the  for the Supreme

4

Court to find the language ambiguous and  and  and

5

strike it down.  So  so that  we should be looking

6

at what Congress's intent was, not  not  not whether

7

or not the crime of violence will still be an aggravated

8

felony after Johnson.  If  if  if there are problems

9

with this, that will be  that will be for Congress to

10
11

fix.
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

May I ask you about the

12

statutory language that seems to me to present the

13

greatest problem for your position.  Maybe it's not

14

fatal, but what I'm referring to is the provision that

15

says the term applies  so we're looking at whether

16

the  the State offense here is described in the

17

Federal arson statute.  And then there's language that

18

says, the term applies to an offense described in this

19

paragraph whether in violation of Federal or State law.

20

 What do you make of that? 

It can be argued

21

that what that means is that, when you have a Federal

22

offense with a jurisdictional provision, you disregard

23

the jurisdictional provision because you're never going

24

to find that in a State provision.

25

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

The  the language you're 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

7
1

you're referring to is  is referred to normally as the

2

penultimate sentence.  And  and the penultimate

3

sentence merely tells us that  that State offenses

4

that are described in the aggravated felony provision

5

are aggravated felonies.  In the  in the board's first

6

matter of VasquezMuniz decision, the board looked at

7

that language and concluded that  that  that all

8

that means is that sometimes State offenses could 

9

could be aggravated felonies, but it didn't require

10

that  that State offenses always be  be aggravated

11

felonies.

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right.  But, I mean,

13

the point is usually when you see language, you know,

14

in  in interstate commerce, your immediate reaction

15

is, oh, that's Federal jurisdiction as opposed to State.

16

But here the one thing we know is they didn't want it to

17

matter.  They said in violation of Federal or State law.

18

 So as I look at it, the  your instinctive

19

reaction is to say, well, then, of course you don't have

20

to worry about provision that is in there to limit the

21

offense to Federal  Federal offenses.

22

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

This  this  this

23

language, it  it  it doesn't  it doesn't directly

24

address jurisdiction.  It  it just  it's just saying

25

that  that  that certain offenses, certain State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

8
1

offenses can be aggravated felonies, but it's not

2

saying 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There  this  this

4

provision applies to an entire list of multiple crimes,

5

right?

6

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8

11

And so for most of those

crimes there is no jurisdictional element at all.

9
10

That is correct, Your Honor.

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

That  that is also correct,

yes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So if you're looking at

12

this as superfluous to not this individual subprovision,

13

one subprovision of many 

14

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

Yes.
 it's doing a lot of

work.

17

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yeah.
It's doing a lot of work

19

because there are a lot of other crimes that qualify

20

under State law, correct?

21

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's correct, yeah.
I mean, your brief and

23

the solicitor general's sort of tunnel in on this one

24

provision of many.  But I'm wondering why?

25

 I'm looking at the entire provision has many

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

9
1

State court analogues that don't involve interstate

2

commerce, correct?

3

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Yes.  So  so under  under

4

our  our reading of the statute, it  it  it

5

doesn't render the  the penultimate sentence a nullity

6

because as  as Justice Sotomayor noted, there  there

7

are  are many State provisions that  that will still

8

be aggravated felonies.  We have all  all  I  I

9

mentioned the  the generic offenses, all the generic

10

offenses will  will be both  both State and 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But suppose 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

What your 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Go ahead.

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

What your theory does is at

15

least create a world in which some things are included

16

and some things are excluded in a way that appears not

17

to make much sense.  Now, you've said no, there is a

18

reason for doing this with arson to limit it to the

19

Federal offense.  But I mean, there are a lot of things,

20

a lot of things on that list that have jurisdictional

21

hooks in them.

22

 So you would be excluding  in addition to

23

arson, you would be excluding the child pornography

24

crime.  You would be excluding a kidnapping crime,

25

excluding felon and possession, excluding receiving

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

10
1

explosives for the purpose of killing somebody.  So you

2

would be excluding all of those.

3

 And then on the other hand, you would be

4

including some things that seem a lot more minor that

5

just happen not to have jurisdictional hooks, like

6

operating a gambling establishment.

7

 So you create a world in which the

8

exclusions and the inclusions seem not to match up with

9

anybody's view of  of a sensible categorization.

10

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Well, the  the  the same

11

way that  that  that there's  there's an

12

aggravated felony provision for arson in the generics

13

for all those things that Your Honor mentioned, that

14

there are other categories of aggravated felony which

15

would cover State offenses for those things:  Sexual

16

abuse of a minor, crime of violence.  And  and even

17

outside the aggravated felony scope, we have crimes

18

involving moral turpitude.  So individuals who commit

19

those crimes on  within a State, they would still be

20

removable and they would still be removable for

21

aggravated felonies 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Take two  two defendants.

23

One is convicted of the Federal offense of possession of

24

a firearm by a convicted felon, where you have to prove

25

a connection between the firearm and interstate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

11
1

commerce.  The second defendant is convicted under an

2

identical State statute, but of course, there's no need

3

to prove an interstate commerce element.  And under your

4

argument, the first would be included and the second

5

would not.

6

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

The person  the State

7

individual would still be removable under the firearm's

8

removability ground.

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but that may be

10

discretionary as mandatory.  That  that does avoid the

11

question somewhat when you say, oh well, there's another

12

section.  Don't worry.  That's your answer.

13

 But that doesn't seem to me a complete

14

answer to the statutory question that Justice Alito's

15

question poses.  You're making the statute a nullity as

16

to the States.

17

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Well, you know, the

18

interstatecommerce provision, it's  it's an element

19

of  of the statute that  that's required for a

20

conviction.

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But does it have to be

22

expressed in the statute?  Is it not always a required

23

element of a Federal crime?  There has to be Federal

24

jurisdiction, so as  as a matter of fact, every

25

Federal crime has some jurisdictional element in it.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

12
1

Right?

2

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but 
Whether it's expressed in

4

the  in the text of the statute or not, the statute's

5

invalid if there's no Federal hook.

6
7
8
9

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

But at the same time in  in

Federal criminal law 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but you're  you're

not  you're just limiting it to the jurisdictional

10

element recited in the statute, right?  That seems to me

11

a little illogical.

12

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

But in this  this Court

13

always requires the jurisdictional element for  for

14

the conviction.  Jones v. United States, there was 

15

there was a conviction under 18 U.S. 844(i), and this

16

Court overturned that  that conviction because the

17

interstatecommerce element wasn't met.  So you  you

18

can't  you can't have the Federal conviction without

19

the interstatecommerce element.

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, but  but it doesn't

21

have to be recited in the statute.  And I mean, if a

22

defendant could come in and challenge his conviction on

23

the ground that there  there was no basis on which the

24

Federal government could  could have reached my

25

conduct.  It was not interstate commerce.  There was 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

13
1
2
3
4

it was not pursuant to a treaty or anything else.
 Doesn't that make the Federal jurisdictional
hook a necessary element of any Federal crime?
 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Yes.  It  the  the

5

Federal jurisdiction element is  is a requirement

6

for  for a  for a conviction.  And 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but  but you're

8

not arguing that.  You're  you're saying only when

9

it's recited in the statute, right?

10
11
12

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

I'm  I'm not following the

distinction that you're making.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

On those other  the

13

ones that are not stated in the statute, it's presumed.

14

It doesn't have to be proven to a jury beyond a

15

reasonable doubt, correct?

16

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

Okay.  Correct, yes.
Can I have  I'm going

to sound like my colleague, Justice Breyer.

19

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Okay.
I became interested in

21

the argument of the National Association of Criminal

22

Lawyers.  And basically, their position is that the

23

definition here that says, an offense described in

24

844  what  of that title, relating to explosive

25

material offenses.  And they argue that that takes arson

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

14
1
2
3
4

out of this section.
 Why  I don't see that argument in your
brief.  Are you disavowing it?  And if so, why?
 MR. GUADAGNO: 

We're  we're not disavowing

5

it, and I think that that does show  support our 

6

our position in  in that it shows how easy it is

7

when  when you have broad language that says

8

eliminate  eliminate elements as  as the government

9

says, that it could be any  it could be any element

10
11
12
13
14

that gets eliminated.  They're saying it's jurisdiction.
 In the amicus brief, it says  it says
arson 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
on your point.

15

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17
18
19
20

I'm not  I'm not even

Okay.
All right.  Did you read

the National Association 
 MR. GUADAGNO: 

I  I am  I am familiar

with 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

argue that point at all.

22

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  They don't

Okay.
They're just saying that

24

this  this is not covered by  the fire, the arson is

25

not covered by the statute at all by the enhancement 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

15
1

by the statute at all, except under the arson provision

2

that requires a sentence for a year.  That's their

3

argument.

4

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

6
7
8
9

That is.
Forget about interstate

or anything else.
 So tell me why you didn't make that
argument.
 MR. GUADAGNO: 

We  we didn't make that

10

argument because we didn't think about it.  Their brief

11

came  came after ours.  And we  we don't necessarily

12

disagree with their provision, with their argument.

13

We  we just didn't make it in our brief.

14

 But  but it does support our  our

15

position, and as  as I was saying earlier that 

16

that  you know, the statute says "described in," okay?

17

And the government is saying "described in" tells us

18

that we  we  we can eliminate elements.  But what's

19

the criteria?  How do you know what  what  what

20

element to  gets eliminated.  And that  that example

21

shows that  that it  it may not necessarily be

22

the  the jurisdictional element, and  and it could

23

just as well be the arson element.

24

 And  and  yeah, why does it have to be

25

the jurisdictional element that gets eliminated?  It

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

16
1

could just as easily be the arson element.

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The sole purpose  the

3

sole purpose of it is to enable Federal authority to be

4

brought to bear on the problem.  It has no relationship

5

to the conduct.  The arson is the same.  The only reason

6

for the jurisdictional provision is to authorize Federal

7

action and nothing to do with the conduct involved in

8

the crime itself.

9

 So I think a jurisdictional provision is not

10

like any other element.  It's there for one purpose

11

only, which is to authorize Federal action.

12

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

On Page 24 of our brief, we

13

cite three provisions from Title 18, two from

14

18 U.S.C. Section 3142, and the third one is 18 U.S.C.

15

Section 5032.  And these three provisions have language

16

referring to State offenses if circumstances giving rise

17

to Federal jurisdiction had existed.  That  that is

18

very clear language removing the jurisdictional element

19

or  or applying a State offense with  to a Federal

20

law.

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And I agree  yes, I

22

agree with you, that's clearer.  But it still doesn't

23

say if  if the jurisdictional element, why not some

24

other element?  Because jurisdictional elements are

25

unique.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

17
1

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

But the important point

2

about  about those three Federal statutes is  is

3

that Congress is saying that if they want jurisdictional

4

elements to be ignored, they're going to say so, and

5

they're going to say so with clear language, much

6

clearer language than  than  than the penultimate

7

sentence or described in, and Congress didn't  didn't

8

do that here.

9

 I mean, basically we're  we're asking to

10

apply the full language of  of  of the statute, and

11

the government is saying omit things.  And  and to

12

omit things, you need clear language.

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, but your

14

assumption is that there  an element is an element is

15

an element, whether it's substantive or jurisdictional.

16

And that's not the way our  our cases have treated

17

them, or  or the general.  I mean, you don't need to

18

rely on it for  for everything, but the Model Penal

19

Code draws a precise distinction between matters

20

relating to the harm or evil sought to be prevented and

21

facts that relate to jurisdiction, venue, or

22

limitations.

23

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

But  but still, the

24

jurisdictional element is required for the conviction.

25

You  you cannot have the  the conviction.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

18
1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Oh, I know.  But my

2

point is it's required for a conviction.  But that

3

doesn't necessarily mean that you would include the

4

jurisdictional element when you're saying, well, what

5

does the claim  what is the  what is the harm or

6

evil sought to be prevented?  And in a statute like

7

this, it seems to me that that's what Congress is

8

concerned about, not the technical elements like, for

9

example, venue.  I mean, is venue an element if it's

10

listed under the  the criminal provision?  Well, sure.

11

It's an element that could have to be proved depending

12

on the terms of the statute.  But that has nothing to do

13

with the harm or evil sought to be prevented.

14

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Okay.  You know, going back

15

to  to the United States v. Jones again, I mean, you

16

know, this  this Court said that Congress didn't

17

intend to make all arson  all  all arsons Federal

18

offenses.  And  and by  by the same token, but

19

that  that if Congress didn't intend to  to make

20

all  all State arsons Federal offenses.  They 

21

they  they shouldn't have intended to make all State

22

arsons rulable offenses or aggravated felonies.

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, but they wanted

24

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

But  but it's  it's 

2

it's described in this paragraph.  So it's still 

3

the language of the penultimate sentence is  is still

4

requiring all  all the  all the elements to  to be

5

met.  You know, it  described in.  It  it has to be

6

described in.

7

 And  and the 844(i), okay, has that

8

jurisdictional element.  And  and there's nothing

9

about the penultimate sentence that  that  that

10

indicates that  that any element of that offense  of

11

an offense can  can be ignored.

12

 You know, under  under the categorical

13

approach, this  this Court has  has regularly

14

compared elements of  of offenses, and we've never had

15

a  a categorical approach case where  where this

16

Court has  has said an element can  can be excluded

17

in the categorical analysis.

18

 And 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, we've  we've

20

not addressed this question in the context of the

21

categorical  application of the categorical approach.

22

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

I  I  I don't dispute it.

23

It  it's never come up and  and sort of my point.

24

But  but  but still, in light of the fact that 

25

that Congress is  is aware that  that this Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

20
1

utilizes the  the  the categorical approach,

2

Congress would have used strong language or clearer

3

language if  if  if there was going to be a

4

modification of the categorical  I mean, this would be

5

a  a major deviation from the way that the categorical

6

approach is applied.  And 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Guadagno, this is along

8

the same lines as the Chief Justice's question.  I mean,

9

tell me if I'm wrong, but jurisdictional elements are

10

different in one important way, which is we don't

11

require mens rea as to jurisdictional elements.

12

 So that's a pretty critical distinction that

13

we've made.  Are you suggesting that jurisdictional

14

elements are different?  You know, you have to prove

15

them, but you don't have to  the  the defendant

16

doesn't have to have mens rea with respect to them.

17

 Why doesn't that suggest that there is a

18

real distinction here between jurisdictional elements

19

and substantive elements that can come into play in this

20

context as well?

21

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

This is the  what Congress

22

showed.  Congress shows a statutory provision with 

23

with  with jurisdictional elements I think should be

24

presumed that  that  that Congress knew what it was

25

doing and it  and it meant 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

21
1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But  but that  the mens

2

rea example is also an example where  where basically

3

State and what we think Congress meant.  And we're

4

saying, you know, Congress could not have meant to

5

require mens rea for a jurisdictional element.

6

 Notwithstanding that there's not language in

7

a statute that says, and there shall be in mens rea for

8

a jurisdictional element.  So why not the same here?

9

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Well, even  even if it's

10

different, okay, even if you're going to say

11

jurisdiction is different, it  it doesn't stop it from

12

being a requirement.  Okay?  It  it may  it may be a

13

different element, it may a different kind of

14

requirement, but it's still a requirement.  And 

15

and  and so you  you can't just  just wish it

16

away.

17

 The  the language  the language in the

18

statute isn't there to  to say, circumstances giving

19

rise to Federal jurisdiction had existed.  Congress

20

didn't put the language in the statute that was

21

necessary to ignore the plain language of the statute,

22

which is  which is that Congress wanted convictions

23

under 18 U.S.C. 844(i) to be aggravated felonies.

24

 The  the 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You could, perhaps, treat

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

22
1

it as we treated the $10,000  million in the 

2

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 in the Ashwan case.
Right.  And  and say,

4

yes, Congress did mean to pick up this definition, the

5

jurisdictional part.

6

 But since no State explosives law will have

7

that in the language, you can  the government could,

8

if it wanted, prove it at the  prove that it was

9

interstatecommerce related at the deportation hearing.

10

That's what we did with the 10,000, isn't it?

11

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.
The reason really is pretty

13

similar here.  The  the reason is there isn't a  you

14

know, there isn't a theft statute in the States which

15

have a $10,000 thing in it, and so it didn't make really

16

sense to think Congress wanted to exclude all those.

17

And  and  and so here this is a big thing,

18

explosives.  I mean, that's quite  quite a major

19

problem trying to have an explosive to blow up a

20

building.  And I think if anything counts as an

21

aggravated Felony, it's that.

22

 But there is this jurisdictional problem.

23

 What do you think about that? 

24

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

25

I just 

I think  the Ashwan, I

think, is  is a very different situation.  The Ashwan

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

23
1

dealt with one specific provision, the

2

$10,000requirement just  just affected that  that

3

single provision.

4

 And  and in that case, there was pretty

5

much a  a nullity situation where that specific

6

provision would  would  would have been rendered a

7

nullity.

8
9
10

 Here, the  the penultimate sentence
relates to the  the entire aggravated Felony
provision.

11

 So my  my reading of the statute 

12

JUSTICE BREYER: 

13
14

The penultimate sentence of

what?
MR. GUADAGNO: 

The penultimate sentence

15

of  of  of 1101(a)(43).  The  the language  the

16

term applies to an offense described in this paragraph

17

whether in violation of Federal or State law.  The

18

board, in its decisions, calls that the penultimate

19

sentence.  That  that  that's why I  I keep

20

referring to it as  as  as that.

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

25

I just need to read it.
Okay.
It's 1101(43) 
 (a)  (a)(43).  It is in

the  the  our Joint Appendix at page 4A.

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3
4

Thanks.
What about the  the

respect that we owe to the BIA for their interpretation?
 MR. GUADAGNO: 

The  the board should not

5

be owed any  any  any deference under  under two

6

different theories.

7

 One is that the criminal lenity rule should

8

apply.  The second is that the longstanding principle

9

of construing lingering ambiguities in deportation

10

statutes in favor of the alien should also be applied.

11

 And with regard to those rules, Chevron is

12

not a rubber stamp.  Chevron tells us that there are

13

certain circumstances when  when deference should be

14

applied to boards' decisions and, if those circumstances

15

are not met, then the board is  is not supposed to be

16

given deference.

17

 And in  in this particular situation, both

18

of these principles that I've just mentioned, they're

19

statutory tools of construction.  And statutory tools of

20

construction are supposed to be applied at  at Chevron

21

step one.  And therefore, the agency should not be owed

22

deference.

23
24
25

 Unless there are any further questions, I
reserve rebuttal time.

 Ms. Goldenberg.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the court:
 Section 1101(a)(43) indicates that

7

violations of State and foreign law should be considered

8

aggravated felonies along with violations of Federal

9

law.  It was enacted against the backdrop of multiple

10

doctrines across multiple areas of the law in which a

11

jurisdictional element drops away when a Federal crime

12

is being compared to a State support crime.

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All these examples you

14

gave me in your brief, either it's clear explicitly that

15

jurisdiction was excluded by the statute or the nature

16

of the offense gives jurisdiction or the Assimilated

17

Crimes Act, it makes sense, because the whole purpose is

18

that it's  that Federal  that a State law is going

19

to apply when there isn't a Federal law.  So applying

20

jurisdiction makes no sense.

21

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Our point 
But  so I don't take

23

much from your arguments, which is the fact that it

24

drops away in other sections.  Congress didn't just say

25

it dropped away here.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

26
1

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, our point isn't that

2

each one of those is exactly analogous.  It's that there

3

are so many different places where it drops away and

4

that that's very telling.  And of course, the purpose of

5

this statute is to capture people who are particularly

6

dangerous who shouldn't be 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But I  I thought  I

8

agreed with that when I came in.  And  and then I

9

thought, my goodness.  Of course.  It's an explosives

10

crime.  My God.  Blowing up a building or a person, if

11

anything's an aggravated felony, that must be.

12

 Then the first words out of his mouth, your

13

friend's mouth, were, have no fear, read on, because

14

there is a section that makes it an aggravated felony to

15

commit a crime of violence.  And "a crime of violence"

16

is very broadly defined.  So any human being who commits

17

an explosives violation where that's a State law

18

violation will fall within the definition of aggravated

19

felony because they will have committed a crime of

20

violence.

21

 So now, if that's right, I'm left with only

22

half the problem I thought I was left with.  And the

23

half I'm still left with is, if we follow your

24

interpretation, what we will suddenly do is put into the

25

category "aggravated felony," which forbids the attorney

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

27
1

general to exercise her discretion and keep the person

2

here even when she wants to, though the Mor case isn't a

3

problem, because after all, she doesn't have to keep him

4

here.  All right?

5

 We put in every tax fraud state, every

6

racketeering, gambling.  I mean, you know the list.  And

7

it includes an awful lot of trivial stuff.  So now I

8

have removing the attorney general's discretion when she

9

wants to keep the thing here  keep the person here in

10

a whole lot of trivial stuff, if I accept your

11

definition.

12

 And if I accept theirs, I don't have the

13

problem I thought I had, which was that people who

14

commit very serious explosive crimes are not in the

15

category "aggravated."

16

 So what is the answer to that?

17

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I didn't think of it until

19

I heard his first argument.

20

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

21
22

I disagree with, I think,

both halves of that.
 And let me start by talking about why I

23

think it remains true, despite the crime of violence

24

provision and other parts of the aggravated felony

25

provision, that Petitioner's approach is radically

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

28
1
2

underinclusive.
 First of all, it's important that we're not

3

just talking about arson here.  We're talking about all

4

of the different describedin provisions where there is

5

a Federal jurisdictional element.  And so there are many

6

things that it is clear would never be picked up by

7

other parts of the aggravated felony that 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I have the list in front of

me, thanks to my law clerk.  And I couldn't find

10

anything on that list which either wouldn't fit within

11

crime of violence or would be so terrible to leave out.

12

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, there are a couple of

13

different examples.  And I also think it's true  and I

14

don't want to leave this on the table  that not all

15

arsons would qualify as crimes of violence.  So I want

16

to get to that as well.

17

 But the things that would be left out and

18

that would not be picked up by other parts of the

19

aggravated felony provision under Petitioner's view

20

would be a number of really serious child pornography

21

offenses if they were prosecuted by a State or by a

22

foreign sovereign, including possessing child

23

pornography, transporting child pornography, putting out

24

a notice saying that you want to receive or exchange

25

child pornography.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

29
1

 Petitioner says in his brief that the sexual

2

abuse of a minor, generic offense, would pick that up.

3

But it wouldn't pick up any of those things that I just

4

described, although, it might pick up some kinds of

5

child pornography offenses:  Gun possession offenses,

6

being a felon in possession of a firearm, being a

7

fugitive from justice in possession of a firearm.  A lot

8

of really serious gun possession offenses also, if

9

prosecuted by a State or prosecuted by a foreign

10

sovereign, would not be picked up.  And Petitioner

11

actually doesn't contend otherwise.

12

 So it is an underinclusive approach. 

And

13

that's true even with respect to arson, because under

14

the crime of violence provision, that has to involve use

15

of force against the person or property of another.  A

16

number of State arson offenses would cover arson against

17

your own property.  And this is a categorical approach.

18

So if a 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't  I don't

20

understand.  Your argument is we have to interpret this

21

thing to be as expansive as possible?

22

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

No.  It's 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, you know, if

24

Congress wanted to cover all those things, it could have

25

used the language it used elsewhere, which says, you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

30
1

know, except  except for the jurisdictional element.

2

But it  it didn't say that.

3

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

It 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What  what do you do

5

about the Federal statute that  that  that makes

6

arson of a Federal building a crime?

7

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, in that case 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Does  does that mean that

9
10
11

all state arson statutes are picked up, whether it's of
a Federal building or of  of the corner grocery store?
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

No.  I think you'd have to

12

engage in an analysis at that point about whether that

13

element was a purely jurisdictional element or whether

14

it had some substantive force to it.  That's not an

15

analysis 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's  that's the key

you  you 
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, I think the key is

19

if  if the board were going to undertake that

20

analysis, which it hasn't done with respect to anything

21

besides interstatecommerce jurisdictional elements,

22

which are classic jurisdictional elements.

23

 But if the board were going to undertake

24

that analysis, I think it would look to the model penal

25

code definition that the Chief Justice pointed to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

31
1

earlier.  And that is the distinction between the harm

2

or evil sought to be prevented and the legislature's

3

power, jurisdictional power, to regulate that harm or

4

evil.

5

 And in the case that you mentioned, I think

6

that might very well be a substantive element, because

7

Congress could be making a determination that if there

8

is something particularly pernicious, particularly

9

culpable, particularly in need of deterrence about arson

10

with respect to Federal property, which Congress really

11

specially wants to protect.  But I don't think you can

12

say that about the interstatecommerce jurisdictional

13

element, which this Court has recognized 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

15

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

19

 Following up on that. 

Why  why is that?
 is a term of art.
Isn't  go ahead.
Justice Alito.

Thank you.
But why isn't that

20

true here, in light of the  the Court's decision in

21

Jones?

22

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The Court's 
Didn't the Court's  didn't

24

the Court's decision in Jones interpret the reference to

25

interstate commerce to be something more than just a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

32
1

jurisdictional hook, but rather a substantive

2

requirement that limited the scope of this particular

3

statute to more severe instances of  of examples of

4

the crime?

5

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I don't think so, because

6

the analysis in Jones was against the backdrop of

7

constitutionalavoidance principle.  And the Court said

8

there might very well have been constitutional problems

9

with interpreting the statute more broadly.  I think

10

the  the best comparison is between Jones and  and

11

Russell.  And you can see there that the

12

interstatecommerce element is not doing substantive

13

work.  If 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I  I don't know

15

why you say that, if it has to have substantive work,

16

otherwise it wouldn't be in the statute.

17

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well 
It  it is picking a

19

crime that only Congress would prosecute, which is

20

following up on Justice Alito's point, substantive

21

because it's more serious.  It has  we have to protect

22

people who are affected from interstate travel, or that

23

affects interstate travel.  You could  even following

24

the model penal code, you could still call this

25

substantive.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

33
1

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I don't think so.  And

2

again, I think the comparison between Jones and Russell

3

makes this point.  In Russell, the Court said that the

4

offense was something that could be prosecuted by the

5

Federal government because it was arson of a rental

6

property which was used in interstate commerce.  In

7

Jones, it was arson against a private nonrental

8

property.  And that was said to fall outside the scope

9

of Section 844(i).

10

 But I don't think you can say that there is

11

something particularly pernicious or culpable about

12

arson against a rental property v. arson against a

13

nonrental property.  I think 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why  why have to subject

15

the Federal courts to  to this  this new distinction

16

between a jurisdictional element that's substantive and

17

one that isn't substantive, just jurisdictional?  Why 

18

why should I do that?  I mean, if it's an element, it's

19

an element.  And if Congress really wants to eliminate

20

the jurisdictional element, it can  it can say so, the

21

way  the way it did in some other statutes.

22

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I think 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And if it doesn't say that,

24

you know, don't bother me.  Isn't  isn't that a

25

sensible way to handle this?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

34
1

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I don't think so, Your

2

Honor.  I don't think it's possible to draw a negative

3

inference from those other statutes.  Congress obviously

4

can get at the same meaning using different forms of

5

words in different statutes in the U.S. Code.

6

 And what's very important about the statutes

7

the Petitioner has pointed to that expressly say that

8

the jurisdictional element should be taken out is that

9

they don't have an analogue to the penultimate sentence

10

in this case, which shows Congress's intent in the

11

aggravated felony provision, that State offenses and

12

foreign offenses count, along with Federal offenses, as

13

aggravated felonies.

14

 And so I think once you get that penultimate

15

sentence in there, it may very well be that Congress no

16

longer feels any need to put in language that's

17

equivalent to the language of those other statutes.  And

18

that 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is that really,

20

Ms. Goldenberg, the only textual basis for your

21

position?  You know, your brief says a good deal about

22

the difference between "described" and "defined," which

23

the Petitioner has suggested is  is  is not a very

24

good distinction, because the "defined" only refers to

25

actual statutory definitions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

35
1

 So are you still relying on that? 

Are you

2

relying on anything else in the statutory text beyond

3

the penultimate sentence, or is the penultimate sentence

4

really the statutory basis for your argument?

5

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

No.  We're certainly still

6

relying on the "describedin" language and the

7

distinction between that language and other language

8

that Congress chose to use elsewhere in the aggravated

9

felony provision.  It's just that we think that it's

10

important that when you look at the meaning of

11

"described in," it be read in light of the penultimate

12

sentence, in light of the purpose of this provision, in

13

light of the irrational patchwork that would be created

14

by Petitioner's view.  So I think all those things

15

inform how you would understand "described in" but with

16

respect to the question of whether "defined in" in this

17

provision was just used to refer to dictionary

18

definitiontype statutory provisions.  I think that that

19

is true.  As a descriptive matter, there are only a

20

couple of "defined in" provisions of the aggravated

21

felony statute, and they do refer to other statutes that

22

say the word X means Y.

23

 But that's not true throughout the U.S.

24

Code, which was Petitioner's original submission.  There

25

are lots of places where Congress has used "defined in"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

36
1

to refer to offenses and to mean exactly what follows

2

but nothing else.  And one very telling example is

3

Section 844(n) which actually refers to Section 844(i),

4

the provision at issue in this case, by talking about

5

offenses defined in this chapter.

6

 So Congress had at its fingertips language

7

that it could have used to refer to these Federal

8

criminal provisions if all it had meant to do was to

9

say, look, we want you to use exactly what comes after

10

this and nothing else.  And there's actually another

11

distinction as well as the "defined in" language in the

12

statute, and that's in Subsection (p), which is found on

13

4A  page 4A of the appendix to the government's brief.

14

There, Congress uses the words "in violation of," an

15

offense which is in violation of a particular Federal

16

statute.

17

 The upshot of Petitioner's position is that

18

any time there's an interstatecommerce jurisdictional

19

element in any of the Federal provisions that are

20

referred to, only a violation of the Federal statute,

21

only a Federal criminal prosecution and conviction will

22

count as an aggravated felony, because no State crime,

23

no foreign crime is ever going to have interstate

24

commerce as an element.

25

 If that's what Congress had meant, if it had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

37
1

meant to strict it to violations of that Federal

2

statute, then, again, it had language at its fingertips

3

that it has used elsewhere in this provision that would

4

have allowed it to do that.

5

 And there's one other aspect of the

6

statutory text that I'd like to mention, and that's just

7

a particular example of a place where Petitioner's

8

reading doesn't make sense in a  in a particular

9

context, in the statute.  And that's Subsection (j)

10

which is on page 2A of the appendix to our brief, and

11

that's offenses described in several Federal provisions,

12

one of which is RICO.  RICO has in it

13

interstatecommerce elements.  And then at the end of

14

the provision, there is one of the limitations that

15

Congress puts in sometimes, and the limitation is that

16

the offense has to be punishable by more than one year.

17

 Again, under Petitioner's view, only actual

18

violations of the Federal  the Federal RICO statute

19

and an actual Federal prosecution and conviction under

20

the Federal RICO statute would ever count under

21

Subsection (j) as an aggravated felony.

22

 But if that were true, there would have been

23

no reason for Congress to have included that last clause

24

there because Federal RICO convictions are always

25

punishable by more than a year.  It says so right in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

38
1

RICO statute.  They're punishable by up to 20 years.  So

2

it must be 

3
4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand what you

 say it again.

5

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

6

 So it's Subsection (j).

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Got it.

8

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

And it is an offense

9
10
11
12
13

Okay.  I'll try.

described in  and I'm just referring to the first
Federal statute that's listed there.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  Can you give

me the number again?
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

It's page 2A of the

14

appendix to the government's brief.  And I should say

15

when this provision went into the aggravated felony

16

statute, it was only RICO and not these other statutes

17

that follow in Subsection (j) that were listed.  So it

18

says an offense described in Section 1962 of Title 18,

19

which is RICO, for which a sentence of oneyear

20

imprisonment or more may be imposed.

21

 And what I'm saying is you can always impose

22

a sentence of one year or more as an abstract matter

23

when you have convicted somebody of a Federal RICO

24

offense.  And so it can't be that just because there's

25

an interstatecommerce element in the Federal RICO

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

39
1

statute, that, therefore, State and foreign convictions

2

all drop away and the only time someone is an aggravated

3

felon under (j) is if they have been convicted of a

4

Federal RICO crime.

5

 If that were right, then there would have

6

been no need for Congress to include that language at

7

the end.

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I see.

9

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

That's there clearly

10

because Congress wanted to pick up State and foreign

11

versions 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right, right, right.

13

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

 of the crime, and to

14

then drop away, as Congress does sometimes, to sort of

15

more minor versions of those crimes where there are

16

different sentencing and penalty schemes in place.

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course he's  he's not

18

arguing that  that all  all Federal jurisdictional

19

requirements have to be one of the elements.  He's only

20

saying that where  where the statute itself recites

21

the jurisdictional element.  Does RICO do that?  What

22

does RICO say?

23
24
25

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Yes.  RICO does recite an

interstatecommerce element.  It does.
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The basic point is I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

40
1

counted 

2

your argument there are about ten of these sections

3

that  you know, you  you couldn't use that as a

4

limitation.  But if I look at those ten individually, I

5

will discover that I  Congress did want to pick up

6

State crimes there or they don't use exactly

7

jurisdiction language like evade a tax imposed under

8

this title.

made an effort to count these.  I accept

9

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Yeah.

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And it isn't really going

11
12

to be the anomaly I thought it was.  That's your point.
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Yes, that's one of my

13

points, certainly.  There are, I think, 17 different

14

places in the aggravated felony provision, if you look

15

at actually each of its little subsections, and some of

16

them have two or three subsections.  And by my count,

17

about nine of them have an interstatecommerce

18

jurisdictional element.  And so it's not that the

19

penultimate sentence would be superfluous in

20

Petitioner's view, but it would start doing work in this

21

very odd way for only about half of the aggravated

22

felony provision, and that would just be a very

23

strange 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It wouldn't be strange if

those were things that covered offenses that it makes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

41
1

sense not to want to put in 

2

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Right.

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 to the definition.

4

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

And I don't think you 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I thought that some of them

6

did, but 

7

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, no.

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The tax one, for example,

9
10

the fraud  tax fraud, but he uses different language.
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Yes.  No, I think as to

11

many of them, as with respect to the arson offense at

12

issue here, it would make sense to pick up State and

13

also particularly foreign crimes.  I don't want foreign

14

crimes to get left out of this discussion because I

15

think it's very important and very important to Congress

16

when dealing with the kinds of people who are going to

17

be covered by the aggravated felony provision that if

18

they had committed a sufficiently serious foreign crime,

19

that that would get picked up.  And, of course, foreign

20

crimes are never going to have an interstatecommerce

21

jurisdictional element in them.

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How do you deal with his

23

lack of uniformity argument?  That is, some crimes

24

will  under State law, the same conduct will be

25

labeled by some States a felony, other States a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

42
1

misdemeanor, and you get a lot of these lessertype

2

offenses swept up into the provision that doesn't allow

3

for cancelation of removal?

4

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

That's not a feature of the

5

board's interpretation in this case.  That's just a

6

feature of the aggravated felony provision that it

7

sometimes sweeps in things that the States characterize

8

as misdemeanors.  And that's very wellrecognized both

9

by the board and by the courts of appeals.  This is a

10

Federal term of art, aggravated felony, which is used to

11

show that certain immigration consequences should attach

12

to someone.

13

 And so the fact that a State

14

idiosyncratically or for its own reasons attaches a

15

particularly low penalty to something that's set forth

16

here is wellrecognized not to be a reason to keep it

17

out of the aggravated felony provision.

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I believe that

19

Mr. Guadagno's point was that this is  it's a reason

20

why Congress may have used the language that it did,

21

rather than, say, just arson.  Right?  That it wanted 

22

that it understood that there was a wealth of very minor

23

arson crimes out there in the States, that it wanted to

24

exclude those.  And the way it excluded those was

25

essentially by saying, no, it's got to be the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

43
1
2

offense.
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I think that would be,

3

again, a sort of strange roundabout way to exclude them,

4

and to move it back through the crime of violence

5

provision, it would be a lot of work.  What Congress

6

could much more easily have done is just to put a

7

limitation right there in (e)(1) as it did in many other

8

provisions that said you have to have a crime that 

9

for which you're imprisoned for at least a year, or a

10

certain value of property has to be affected.

11

 And Congress did that, not only when it was

12

describing  I'm sorry, generic aggravated felonies,

13

but also it did it in some of the "describedin"

14

sections like Subsection (j) that I was talking about

15

earlier.  So that, I think, would be the way that

16

Congress would have approached it.

17

 At the same time, I don't think there's

18

anything at all strange in thinking that Congress didn't

19

want to exclude even things that are more minor as

20

arsons go on a scale of arsons on the view that arson is

21

a really serious crime.  It is aggravated in every sense

22

of that word.

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But this one  this one

24

wasn't  I mean, his  his crime, he got oneday jail

25

time and five years of probation.  So it falls on the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

44
1

lesser side.  Given your argument, is there any way that

2

a person in his situation could get a cancelation of

3

removal?

4

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

No.
So he's just stuck 

6

this is absolute?  Even when it's a oneday jail time, a

7

lesser crime, there's no  you're really locked into no

8

means to obtain cancelation of removal.

9

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

That's right that he can't

10

obtain cancelation of removal, and that's consistent

11

with Congress's intent in putting the aggravated felony

12

provision into place, which was to constrain the

13

attorney general's discretion and to make it so that the

14

attorney general was locked into certain conclusions.

15

 And that was because Congress thought that

16

the way that the whole cancelation of removal process

17

was working before the aggravated felony provision went

18

into place was it wasn't working well.  Too many people

19

were being allowed to stay, and too many people were

20

having their removal canceled.  And Congress expressed

21

very clear in the legislative history that it didn't

22

like that, and it wanted to constrain the attorney

23

general's discretion.

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I was just going to

say, of course, the attorney general may decide not to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

45
1
2
3

subject the alien to removal in the first place, right?
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

That's true, yes.

Although, aggravated felony is a ground for removal.

4

 But also, I don't want to lose sight of the

5

fact that just because this Petitioner's sentence was

6

one day and five years of probation does not mean that

7

he committed a minor crime of some kind.  We actually

8

don't know what the conduct was.  It's not in the

9

record.

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But the only thing you've

11

been able to think of, my guess is, that gets around his

12

argument that arson and explosives will be covered by

13

the crime of violence is that:  What if a person sets

14

fire to his own property?

15

 Now, when would a person set fire to his own

16

property?  When he wants to commit fraud.  And here we

17

have a provision that puts fraud within it.  And

18

moreover, it has the limitation of $10,000.  So

19

therefore, serious fraud crimes will fall within this

20

other section.

21

 So not even the case that you've really

22

brought up is  actually needs this provision if you

23

prosecute State explosives crimes, because either

24

they're against other people's property, in which case

25

they fall within crime of violence, or they're against

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

46
1

your own property, in which case they are a specie of

2

fraud over $10,000.

3

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I'm not sure that

4

necessarily works under the categorical approach because

5

it would depend what the person was actually prosecuted

6

for in State court, and if they were prosecuted not for

7

fraud, but simply for arson, and it was a provision that

8

said  that included arson against your own property,

9

then I think you wouldn't fall into either one.

10

 But there's actually another reason that I

11

didn't get to before why I think some arsons might not

12

be crimes of violence.  And there's actually just some

13

uncertainty around this, but after this Court's decision

14

in Leocal, people are continuing to wrestle with whether

15

recklessness would count as a crime of violence.  I

16

think there are some, at least, forms of recklessness

17

that are picked up by the substantive elements of

18

Section 844.  Malicious arson would include deliberate

19

indifference to the possibility that there is going to

20

be damage, so there might be some slippage there as

21

well.  Although, as I say, I 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So what do you think about

23

this?  I mean, I  I think I dread the suggestion, but

24

when I got into that, I thought, God, there is no way to

25

avoid just doing this section by section and saying,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

47
1

what did Congress want, section by section.  And then

2

sometime  you know, and then if we did that section by

3

section, maybe it would be satisfactory to say, you

4

know, let them prove the jurisdictional hook in the 

5

in the deportation proceeding.

6

 That gives the attorney general considerably

7

more discretion.  She can do it if she wants; she

8

doesn't have to do it if she doesn't want to.

9

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Although I hesitate to

10

object to a helpful suggestion, I actually think that

11

the answer here is to drop out the jurisdictional

12

provision entirely and not to do that for a couple

13

different reasons.

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, we 
First of all, I don't think

16

it works for foreign crimes.  So in a foreign crime

17

situation, you can't come in and provide proof that it

18

had an interstate commerce element because there's not

19

really an equivalent to that on the foreign side.

20

 And so I just think there is a whole serious

21

set of crimes that Congress wanted to include as to

22

which that approach wouldn't function.

23
24
25

 It would also really multiply the difficulty
of the proceedings and make them much longer and harder.
 And I do think the language here is a little

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

48
1

different here than the language that the Court was

2

looking at in Nijhawan, where this $10,000 limitation

3

was in the aggravated felony provision itself and it was

4

worded in a particular way that the Court seized on.

5
6

 I  I  so I just don't think that
analysis necessarily carries over here.

7

 But again, I think that all of the various

8

signs that you would use to interpret the statute 

9

and  and by the way, four of the courts of appeals

10

that have addressed this have said the statute is

11

unambiguously clear.  It means what the board said it

12

meant.  I think that  that all of those signs are in

13

place and so you should be talking 

14
15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Can I  can I go back to

your  to your argument about Subsection (j)?

16

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes.
Are there State RICO

18

offenses for which a maximum  the maximum term of

19

imprisonment is less than a year?

20

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I don't know the answer to

21

that, but I think there might be  there might be such

22

offenses and there might be foreign offenses like that

23

as well.  And I haven't been able to canvas that whole

24

area, obviously.

25

 And I still think that's the only

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

49
1

explanation for that limiting language at the end of 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

3

RICO offenses at all?

4

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Are there State or foreign

I  I  I  honestly, I

5

don't know the answer to that, but I think there might

6

well be.

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

There are State  there are

8

State RICO statutes, but RICO is a  is a  is

9

regarded as a very serious crime.  It seems strange to

10

have a  a RICO misdemeanor.  I've never heard of such

11

a thing.

12

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I mean, I seized on the

13

RICO statute, but actually the very next provision in J,

14

which is Section 1084, the same analysis would apply.

15

Section 1084 is a statute that has an interstate

16

commerce element in it.  It has to do with gambling and

17

transmitting information for gambling interstate

18

commerce.  And it is punishable by two years when it is

19

prosecuted federally and there is a Federal conviction.

20

 So the same analysis would work there as

21

well, and that's something where I think it's pretty

22

clear that there would be State analogues to the

23

substantive elements of that crime.  There would be

24

foreign analogues to the substantive elements of that

25

crime as well.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

50
1

 I did want to pick up on one other thing

2

that Petitioner said in his presentation, which is,

3

well, why didn't Congress just use the generic

4

definition of arson here?

5
6

 And I think there are a number of reasons
for that.

7

 For one thing, I think it would have been

8

underinclusive because it wouldn't have included the

9

explosive offenses that are set forth in the Federal

10

statute very likely.  Or it's possible that courts would

11

have reached that conclusion.

12

 For another, I think it would have

13

entailed  and I know this Court is familiar with the

14

process  it would have entailed coming up with what

15

the elements of that generic offense are, and that can

16

be difficult.  I think it could be especially difficult

17

in the arson context where there are states that are

18

sort of all over the place and that has moved away from

19

the classic common law definition of burning of a

20

dwelling place.

21

 And so I think there are very good reasons

22

that Congress had when it found a Federal criminal

23

provision that had the substantive elements that it

24

wanted to simply refer to that Federal criminal

25

provision using the looser language of described in, in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

51
1

light of the penultimate sentence, and that's something

2

that would 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I can't square this with

4

the categorical approach.  I  I  you know, we've

5

been very clear.  The categorical approach says, every

6

element of a crime that has to be proven to a jury has

7

to be included in the State offense.  But now you're

8

saying it's every categorical element that's not

9

jurisdictional.

10

 Where do you get that from?

11

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, I think the thrust of

12

the categorical approach is that you don't look at the

13

particular conduct that the person engaged in.  You look

14

at the elements of the crime that they were convicted

15

of.  And then you compare it to something that Federal

16

law tells you to compare it to.

17

 And I think that is a question of statutory

18

interpretation, what it is that you're supposed to be

19

comparing it to, that the Federal law is telling you is

20

the proper comparator.

21

 And here, that's the question we're

22

answering.  I mean, that's the question about what

23

described in means.  About what it means in light of the

24

penultimate sentence.

25

 I don't think there's anything in this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

52
1

Court's categoricalapproach cases that would preclude

2

the interpretation that we're putting forth here today.

3

I just think it hasn't a risen in exactly this way

4

before.

5

 But again, this  the important thing about

6

the categorical approach is that you don't look at the

7

Petitioner's particular conduct here.  As I say, it's

8

not even in the record what his conduct is.  All that we

9

know is that he committed a felony under New York State

10

law that was punishable, my understanding is, by up to

11

seven years in prison.

12

 And that's the only information we have.

13

 And then we have to look at the elements of

14

the New York statute that he was convicted under and

15

compare them to the offense described in Section 844(i).

16

 To the extent that the Court thought there

17

were ambiguities, we would ask for deference to the

18

board here.  But we don't think there is ambiguity.  We

19

think that, as the courts of appeals have said, that

20

there is one reading of the statute to which all signs

21

point, and that's the reading the Court should adopt.

22

 If there are no further questions 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the board's original

24

decision was the other way, and it wasn't till the

25

circuit came  came out, and then the board went in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

53
1

line with the circuit so that the board read it 

2

doesn't that dilute the strength of the board's current

3

position, that it was not its original position?

4

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I don't think so.  I mean,

5

it is true that the board changed positions, but it knew

6

that it was doing it and it gave reasons for doing it

7

and it gave a lot of reasons in its ultimate decision in

8

2002 that are not reflected in the original decision

9

that the board doesn't seem to have considered in the

10
11

original decision.
 So I just think it's the  the

12

VasquezMuniz decision from 2002 that has an analysis

13

very similar to the analysis of the courts of appeals

14

that have found the statute unambiguous, have walked

15

through here in looking at, not only at the describedin

16

language itself, but at all the other signs about what

17

the statute means.  And I don't think it should be a

18

negative that the board revisited it and came to the

19

correct conclusion.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW L. GUADAGNO
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 MR. GUADAGNO: 

Congress could  could have

11

utilized generic arson.  Throughout Title XVIII there

12

are references to  to arson.  Both briefs talk about

13

the Federal "Three Strikes" law.  Within the Federal

14

"Three Strikes" law is actually a definition of arson.

15

Congress could have  could  could have referred to

16

the definition of arson in that provision.

17

 In provision (K) of the aggravated felony

18

provision, it  it discusses, first generically,

19

managing a prostitution business, and then it refers to

20

Title XVIII offenses regarding transportation of 

21

of  of prostitutes.

22

 Congress could have said arson, and then 

23

and then referred to Title XVIII U.S.C. 844(i).  It

24

could have combined both generic arson and a reference

25

to  to  to explosive devices.

 With regards to the comment about not all

2

State arson offenses being crimes of violence because

3

some would involve personal property, that issue has

4

been resolved by the Board of Immigration Appeals since

5

1998.  Our brief  our reply brief mentions a case from

6

the board called Matter of Palacios where the board held

7

that damaging your own property would  would

8

constitute  burning your own property through arson

9

would constitute a  a  a crime of violence.

10

 With regards to the comments about  about

11

"defined in" with regards to the INA, "defined in" is

12

used consistently to  to refer to a definition, and

13

the congressional drafting manuals all indicate that

14

"defined in" should  should be referring to  to a

15

definition.

16

 And my final point is that what we're

17

seeking here is  is cancelation of removal,

18

discretionary relief, and that  that Congress would

19

not have wanted to deprive individuals who have been

20

convicted of minor offenses or less serious offenses of

21

such discretionary relief and would want them to have a

22

chance to demonstrate

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What do you do with 

24

if we rule your way, that it won't address the child

25

pornography possession laws or that it won't address

some of the explosion laws?

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

there is overlap and  and that they're very likely

As I said before, there 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, I want to know where

the overlap is for the child pornography.

6

 MR. GUADAGNO: 

There  there is  on that

7

one, I don't think there is  there is any question

8

about that because there is a Second Circuit case  I

9

believe it's called Ouch v. Holder, where  where the

10

government did not pursue the child pornography under 

11

under the provision my friend is referring to.  It was

12

pursued under  under sexual abuse of the minor.  So 

13

so that  that is  there is at least one case out

14

there where  where that is the way that the government

15

pursued one  one of these cases.

19

 If there are no further questions, thank
you.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you,

Mr. Guadagno, counsel.

20

 The case is submitted.

 (Whereupon, at 12:00 p.m., the case in the

22

aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
