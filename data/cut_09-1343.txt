CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro.

Mr. Fergenson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR F. FERGENSON

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FERGENSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Because J. McIntyre did not direct any

12

activity at residents of New Jersey either itself or by

13

directing its distributor MMA to do so and had no

14

awareness or knowledge that the distributor took the

15

action that it did toward New Jersey, New Jersey lacked

16

adjudicative jurisdiction.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When you say "its

18

distributor," was this distributor at all controlled by

19

the defendant?

20

MR. FERGENSON:

No, Your Honor.

It was not.

21

And both under Ohio law, Wells v. Komatsu America, and

22

under the Restatement (Second) Agency, section 1(1), the

23

right to control is essential to ascribe actions to

24

create an agency, and it's on a per-purpose basis.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It might be better to refer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

to it as the company that distributed its product,

2

rather than calling it "its distributor."

3

MR. FERGENSON:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

Very good, Your Honor.
It's loaded, it seems to

me.

6

MR. FERGENSON:

Very good, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Fergenson, in your

8

question presented to this Court, you ask whether

9

there's personal jurisdiction -- and I'm quoting here -

10

"solely because the manufacturer targets the United

11

States market for the sale of its product."

12

So I'm taking from that, that you

13

acknowledge that this manufacturer, McIntyre, a British

14

manufacturer, targeted the United States market for the

15

sale of its product.

16

That's correct, yes?

MR. FERGENSON:

Your Honor, that's what the

17

New Jersey Supreme Court held, and that's how we

18

fashioned the -

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's your question

21

MR. FERGENSON:

-- the test.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Did this -- well, I'll just

20

presented.

23

ask you, then:

Did this manufacturer target the United

24

States market?

Did it want to sell its products in the

25

United States?
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. FERGENSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So what does that

3

mean, exactly, Mr. Fergenson?

Because the United States

4

is the United States.

5

assume that what that means is the manufacturer wanted

6

to sell its products in each of the 50 States.

7

right?

It's made up of 50 States.

So I

Is that

8

MR. FERGENSON:

No, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It only wanted to sell its

10

product in a few States?

11

MR. FERGENSON:

No, Your Honor.

It wanted

12

to sell its product anywhere that the distributor could

13

find.

14

The distributor was the market manager.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

Anywhere.

So if the

15

distributor came up with California, that was great.

16

the distributor came up with a customer in New Jersey,

17

that was great.

18

all over the United States.

19

As many as possible, more the better,

MR. FERGENSON:

Is that right?
As many as possible,

20

wherever the -- the distributor could find a customer,

21

yes, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Exactly.

So you targeted

23

New Jersey no less than you targeted California or New

24

York or Illinois or Massachusetts or anything else.

25

MR. FERGENSON:

Well --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why shouldn't there be jurisdiction in

MR. FERGENSON:

Well, Your Honor, because,

5

first, this Court's jurisprudence looks to a direct act,

6

from World-Wide Volkswagen and even before, as it

7

brought forward Hanson.

8

World-Wide Volkswagen, Burger King and Justice

9

O'Connor's concurrence in Asahi and the other

As this Court has applied

11

in Asahi, look toward a specific State -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Fergenson, I suppose

13

you could say the same thing about any United States

14

manufacturer -

15

MR. FERGENSON:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

Yes.
-- who would desire to sell

his product in any of the States that would buy it.

18

MR. FERGENSON:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor.
And to say that this

20

foreign manufacturer is therefore suable in any State

21

would mean that any American manufacturer is suable in

22

any State, which -

3

question is, when you target the entire United States

4

and each of the 50 States within that and an accident

5

occurs within one of those States, are you subject to

6

jurisdiction in that State for that accident, for a

7

claim based on that accident?

8

for a claim based on that accident.

9

This is not general

This is specific jurisdiction.

So the

Not generally, but just

Didn't even Justice O'Connor -- you

10

referenced the Asahi opinions, but Justice O'Connor said

11

as long as there's purposeful availment, there is

12

specific jurisdiction, and there is purposeful availment

13

when there's an active effort to target a market.

14

MR. FERGENSON:

Well, Your Honor, in Burger

15

King, in Hanson, in World-Wide Volkswagen, the

16

purposeful availment is defined as conducting activities

17

5

MR. FERGENSON:

And here the claim arose in

explicitly provides, and they -- it's arisen in statute

7

of limitation cases, and it goes back to Travelers

8

Indemnity v. Trowbridge, that an action under both

express and common law indemnity arises under contract.

10

So, upon the assignment -- and there need

11

not be a judgment under Ohio law; that's Fort Defiance

12

Construction v. Village of Grover Hill -- there can be

13

an assignment of a common law indemnity under strict

Why is it just and right

know first -- you said there is jurisdiction in Ohio and

not in New Jersey.

6

the accident occurred; and in Ohio, there's nothing but

7

the relationship between the distributor -- there's a

does Ohio have jurisdiction over this New Jersey tort?

In New Jersey, it's the place where

Ohio has New Jersey -

three places that Mr. Nicastro, in looking over this,

Ginsburg -- I don't want to make your argument for you,

in Justice O'Connor's footnote on national contacts in

Asahi, which was not disputed and I think essentially

accepted by Justice Brennan -- in that footnote, it

states that national contacts is for the national

That seems backwards.

MR. FERGENSON:

that if one looks at this as part of the Congress's

power to control, let's say, imports, then as a

condition -- and this is what the proposed Foreign

Suppose you had the same arrangement with

hypothetical.

fact of the matter is if the manufacturer purposefully

availed itself of -- of the market which would include

there's a lot of rhetoric, and there are all kinds of

characterizations, but when I looked for facts, I found

3

those three, and I want to be sure I have them all.

4

MR. ROSS:

You do, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I do.

Now, then my

6

question following from that, if I have those are the

7

three facts, what worries me is the exact opposite of

8

what the New -- the New Jersey Supreme Court said.

9

said in worldwide markets this is a good thing.

It

I think

10

I worry about it, because I'm worried about the woman's

11

cooperative in India, I'm worried about the Chinese

12

development, I'm worried about development everywhere.

13

We have a lot of small businesses.

14

now, maybe the worry is legally irrelevant -- but I'd

15

worry about a rule of law that subjects every small

16

business in every developing company -- in every

17

developing country to have to be aware of the law in 50

18

States simply because they agreed to sell to an

19

independent company who is going to sell to America,

20

plus your two factors.

21

And I'd worry -

And really the third is none, because if it

22

hadn't ended up somewhere, there'd have been no

23

accident.

24

MR. ROSS:

I would say -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, that's my basic

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1
2

concern here.
MR. ROSS:

I would say in -- in response to

3

your hypothetical question, that because there was

4

purposeful availment where they came to the United

5

States, attended trade shows in an effort to sell their

6

product to anyone who would come to that trade show

7

throughout the United States, and those sales were in

8

fact consummated, then in that case I think that the

9

manufacturer has done more than just intend to sell.

10

They have taken certain positive steps.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Okay, but you see

12

what my -- my problem is a sort of policy problem that

13

may be irrelevant, but I -- I don't see how the world's

14

going to work or develop if in fact every small business

15

everywhere in the world has to know, you know, the law

16

of every 50 States and hire lawyers and come here,

17

rather than making the accident victim go there.

18

Now, it's tough on the accident victim, but

19

the other is also tough.

20

of the -- I'm sketching out my concerns here.

MR. ROSS:

Yes.

In -- in my judgment, it's not

4

enough to just have intent; it's not enough just to send

5

the product out on -- adrift on the stream of commerce.

6

There has to be some additional conduct, some concrete

7

steps taken.

And I believe -

MR. ROSS:

-- in your hypothetical,

10

attending the trade shows, perhaps hiring a distributor,

selling the products -

21

market -- maybe it's Great Britain, maybe it's China -

22

believe -

we do this to a company in England, any country in the

would have to honor a judgment from Bangladesh based

16

upon -- against an American company, based upon a

17

similarly modest degree of -- of availment, right?

19

the extent of the availment, I would say, under those

20

circumstances.

as what you propose here, or as extensive.

That's just a pure advertising; not enough.
