 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 131174, Gelboim v. Bank of 

5

America.

 Mr. Goldstein. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court: 
 My clients filed this lawsuit against 

12

Mr. Waxman's clients.  The district court dismissed that 

13

lawsuit and said that it was terminated. 

14

 Now, from the earliest days of this Court's 

15

 excuse me, this nation's jurisdictional statutes, 

16

that would be an appealable order under the aptly named 

17

Final Judgment Rule, and that must be so unless 

18

something changed with Congress's enactment of Section 

19

1407(a) of the multidistrict litigation statute.  And we 

20

ask you to hold that nothing changed, and it was 

21

appealable for three reasons. 

22

 The first is the judgment was entered in 

23

this action.  It was dismissed.  We had our own 

24

complaint, our own docket, our own lawyers, our own 

25

plaintiffs, and our own defendants.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

 The second is that there is no judgment in 

2

the MDL itself, so there is nothing from which we could 

3

appeal at the end of the MDL litigation, so it must be 

4

that we appeal from this. 

5

 And the third is that Rule 54(b) of the 

6

Rules of Civil Procedure does not apply because that 

7

applies to the dismissal of part of an action, some of 

8

the claims or some of the parties, not the whole action. 

9

And here, the whole action was dismissed. 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you tell me, 

11

first, what difference there is, if any, pursuant to 

12

your reasons, that would not apply to a consolidated 

13

case for all purposes, number one?  And, number two, 

14

isn't a case consolidated with others, for purposes of 

15

pretrial proceedings, a pending action that involves 

16

multiple parties? 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

As to the first, there are 

18

different forms of consolidation.  Both sides agree with 

19

that.  They make this point, the Respondents do, on 

20

page 33 of their brief.  There are forms of 

21

consolidation that produce a single action.  That can 

22

happen under Rule 20 with joinder.  It can happen under 

23

Rule 42(a)(1) if the parties consent with consolidation. 

24

The cases can become so intertwined that there is 

25

effectively one case, one complaint, and one action.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

2

majority of the cases.  In 

3
4
5
6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That doesn't happen most of 

the time.  That's correct. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

In  in most of the 

MDLs 

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

That's, frankly, not the 

Yes. 
 most of the cases 

retain their individual character, even though they're 

10

consolidated for all purposes.  There may be a case 

11

that's taken as a test case among the many, et cetera. 

12

 Your rule basically is saying consolidation 

13

now will permit piecemeal appeals in almost every 

14

circumstance, except for a very limited number. 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

One preliminary point and 

16

then the question about what our rule produces. 

17

 In MDL litigation, as this district court 

18

recognized, you actually don't have consolidation for 

19

all purposes.  Section 1407(a) specifies is that there 

20

can be consolidation for pretrial purposes only.  The 

21

pretrial purposes in this case are over.  The complaint 

22

was dismissed. 

23

 Now, as to the policy arguments of the 

24

Respondents, that there is a grave concern that our rule 

25

would produce interlocutory appeals that go up to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

court of appeals, lots of different times, there is a 

2

straightforward answer to that point, and that is that 

3

district courts, just as they have the discretion to 

4

enter a partial final judgment under Rule 54(b), have 

5

the same discretion to avoid entering a final judgment 

6

in individual actions under Rule 58(b). 

7

 And this is very common in MDL litigation, 

8

just as you indicate, Justice Sotomayor.  Very 

9

frequently district courts will enter consolidated 

10

complaints and will not enter orders in the individual 

11

actions that would be appealable. 

12

 The distinct feature of this case, the 

13

critical distinct feature here is that this district 

14

court decided to dismiss in its entirety our individual 

15

actions.  She didn't have to do that, but she did it 

16

consciously 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, does the 

18

150day provision kick in?  I mean, you said don't worry 

19

about this.  District courts can just put it on the back 

20

burner for three years, however long.  Doesn't the 

21

150day provision kick in if, in fact, the district 

22

court has dismissed all of the claims? 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Two things, Mr. Chief 

24

Justice.  First, we think it does not.  So here we're 

25

talking about Rule 58(b) and Rule 58(c).  And I

Alderson Reporting Company

apologize, those 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Doesn't Rule 58 say 

unless otherwise provided? 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes.  But you 
So they  automatic 

6

entry of judgment doesn't happen if the district judge 

7

specifically otherwise provides. 

8

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That is correct.  But there, 

9

the Chief Justice is pointing out that it's not entirely 

10

clear what 58(c) means and how long the district court's 

11

discretion lasts under Rule 58(b).  I will give you an 

12

example, and if the Court wanted the  the library or 

13

the clerks to look up the 1935 MDL in the 

14
15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Oh, we could do it 

ourselves. 

16

 (Laughter.) 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The MDL litigation  as you 

18

well could  the MDL litigation in the Chocolate 

19

litigation, there the district court used the tool that 

20

we're discussing right now.  It said, I'm going to 

21

resolve some of the claims, but I'm not going to enter 

22

an appealable judgment. 

23

 We do think that's the better reading. 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

How do you do that? 

Because not  not all of us can look it up themselves.

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

There is a 

The rule does say that the 

6

clerk, once the  once the judge denies all relief, he 

7

says to you or somebody, I deny all relief in your case, 

8

then the clerk is supposed to just enter the judgment.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

supposed to not do that?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So how  how is the judge 

Just noting that I do want 

13

to return to the other tools the district court has. 

14

15

rules, so I'm going to describe it for you, and that 

16

is

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why not just answer what I 

just asked you. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  That is, that Rule 

58(b)(1) provides 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yeah. 
 that the district 

23

court  and this is the provision Justice Ginsburg is 

24

talking about  the district court may direct the clerk 

25

not to enter a judgment.  The Rule 58 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER: 
he says don't do it. 

 But we have seven  I mean, I am moved by 
this.  We have a group of federal district judges 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

7
8
9
10

Oh, I get it.  I see.  So 

Yes. 
 who actually don't have 

to look these up because every day they work with them. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, they are actually 

they are not 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And tell us your rule  if 

11

we agree with you, we are going to produce a mess.  And 

12

then they have about seven different ways in which it 

13

will produce a mess in various cases.  And so, 

14

obviously, I do pay attention when the district judges 

15

do say that. 

16

 And so I'm not a district judge, but I don't 

17

want to produce a mess for them.  The MDL is trying to 

18

do the opposite.  So what's the answer to what they say? 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  What they say, 

20

Mr. Justice Breyer, is actually not that our  our 

21

result will produce a mess.  It is  they quite clearly 

22

say, we're not asking you to  we're not saying what 

23

the correct interpretation of the statute or rules are. 

24

They have a grave concern that you identify, which is we 

25

don't want automatic interlocutory appeals from MDLs.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

 Our answer is that our rule does not produce 


2

automatic interlocutory appeals because district judges 


3

are perfectly free, through a number of tools, only one 


4

of which we've been discussing, not to enter. 


5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Has  has that happened to 


6

a lot of district judge?  Your rule is the district 


7

judge, despite Rule 58(b), et cetera, says, I deny all 


8

relief in your case, Mr. Smith, everyone out, goodbye. 


9

 Then you say to the clerk, Clerk, don't 


10

enter the piece of paper called the judgment because I 

11

don't want them to take an appeal. 

12

 And then they ask for mandamus on the ground 

13

that must be an abusive discretion.  What happens?  Or 

14

has it happened a lot? 

15
16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

There is an MDL in which 

this happened. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

What? 
It is the Chocolate MDL. 
All right. 
Well, the reason it doesn't 

21

happen very often, Justice Breyer, is this problem 

22

doesn't happen very often.  So preliminarily, the only 

23

time 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  So I see.  Your rule 

will, in fact, win your case for your client.

Alderson Reporting Company

11

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

3
4

No. 
And then in the future, no 

one else is 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Breyer, that is not 

5

correct.  Frequently district judges will want these 

6

questions to go up on appeal because they will get 

7

guidance. 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

54. 
Now, they can do it under 54 

10

or they can enter a final judgment in the case.  So 

11

there is the 1935 MDL using Rule 58(b), but there are 

12

many other tools the district judges have. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Goldstein, as  as 

14

your view of the case is 54(b) would not be 

15

appropriate 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
 when the  when the 

18

judge says, I dismiss this claim entirely.  This 

19

complaint is out.  It's a final judgment.  It's not 

20

appropriate for Rule 54 because Rule 54(b) is when one 

21

claim is done, but other claims are still pending. 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That's correct.  Justice 

23

Breyer's suggestion of Rule 54(b) would not work if the 

24

district judge has dismissed the entire action. 

25

 It does say by its terms that it applies

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

only to the dismissal of some of the parties or some of 

2

the claims in the action.  The action throughout the 

3

rule of civil proceed  Rules of Civil Procedure refers 

4

only to one thing, that is, the individual piece of 

5

litigation.  We have our own complaint, our own docket, 

6

our own plaintiffs, defendants, and lawyers. 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  but your  your 

8

answer is that, oh, well, the district judge can find 

9

plenty of ways, disingenuously perhaps, to say this 

10

isn't going to be entered yet, we're just going to wait. 

11

And so Chief Justice says you have the 150day problem. 

12

It  it seems to me that if you're asking for these 

13

sort of furtive measures, we might as well face up to 

14

the problem right away and just adopt Mr. Waxman's 

15

position. 

16
17
18
19
20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, we 

don't think it's 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems to me you're 

asking the judge to be almost disingenuous. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, we disagree for the 

21

following reason, and that is, if the point of 

22

Mr. Waxman's side is that district judges need 

23

discretion to decide when to enter judgments, whether 

24

they're 54(b), partial final judgments, or final 

25

judgments under Rule 58, the discretion should be the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

same. 

2

 And the tools that I'm talking about are not 

3

used disingenuously by your district judges.  They are 

4

used consistently, and that is 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Are you then saying that 

6

there's no practical difference between your position 

7

and Mr. Waxman's position?  In other words, you're 

8

saying Rule 54 is not the right vehicle. 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And that's an important 

11

point. 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's important to get the 

14

rules right, whether it's Rule 54 or something else. 

15

But are you saying that there is no practical difference 

16

between the two? 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I'm saying there's little 

18

practical difference.  There is some, and that is that 

19

their side requires the district court and the court of 

20

appeals to have litigation on whether Rule 54(b) 

21

certification is appropriate, and whether the district 

22

court abused its discretion in entering a Rule 54(b) 

23

judgment.  But there isn't much beyond that. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

There's one huge 

difference.  The district judge can say no to 54(b) if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

it's a final judgment.  In this  in this very case, 

2

that's exactly what the judge said.  In the first round, 

3

he said, you have an appeal of right, and  she said to 

4

the plaintiff who was dismissed. 

5
6
7

 And then when the Second Circuit said no, 
she refused to give a 54(b). 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The reason it's not a huge 

8

difference, Justice Ginsburg, is that the district court 

9

doesn't have to enter a final judgment. 

10

 I'll give you a very specific example. 

The 

11

district court in this case entered a ruling in three 

12

different cases, the OTC plaintiff's case, the exchange 

13

plaintiff's case, and the  our clients, the bondholder 

14

case.  And if the district court had instead entered her 

15

opinion in the OTC or exchange complaints in the 

16

complaint that had just an antitrust claim, for example, 

17

that did not have just an antitrust claim, then there 

18

would not be an appealable final judgment. 

19

 The district court quite consciously 

20

resolved all the antitrust issues, knowing that they 

21

would go up on appeal.  She just changed her mind only 

22

after the Second Circuit, in a rule that the Respondents 

23

do not defend, decided that it did not want to hear the 

24

appeal as a matter of its discretion. 

25

 It is quite important, I think, that 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I don't think this court 

2

of appeals said as a matter of its discretion, and that 

3

was one thing that puzzled me about your presentation. 

4

The court of appeals said we have no jurisdiction. 

5

That's quite different from saying we have discretion. 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Ah.  But, Justice Ginsburg, 

7

their rule is a casebycase determination if they do 

8

have jurisdiction.  And they said, in our  they did it 

9

sua sponte.  The defendants did not move actually to 

10

dismiss our appeal.  The court of appeals, applying this 

11

casebycase rule that's very hard to predict, which is 

12

why the Respondents don't defend it, said, we think 

13

they didn't explain much about what they  the reason 

14

that they dismissed it. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

16
17

They said we had no 

jurisdiction. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right, they did.  But their 

18

rule is that sometimes you can have an  an appeal like 

19

this, and they will deem it to be an appealable final 

20

judgment. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

They said they  they 

22

there was a  there's a phrase that the Second Circuit 

23

uses, and it  something to the effect of an 

24

extraordinary case, an exceptional case. 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes, that's correct.  Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

2

there's no jurisdiction. 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

But their main rule is 

Right.  And the great 

4

majority of circuits apply the opposite rule.  They 

5

recognize that there's no reason to depart from the 

6

ordinary, longsettled understanding of what a final 

7

judgment is.  It is called the final judgment rule.  We 

8

happen 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can we go back to 

10

Justice Kennedy's question about the disingenuous nature 

11

of this? 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yeah. 
So we write an opinion 

14

and say, no, it's a final judgment.  It could be 

15

appealed. 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

Yes. 
But district courts, you 

have other tools not to enter the judgment? 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
You can delay it? 
I 
That  that does sound 

23

like all we're saying that this is a very formalistic 

24

ruling.  But haven't we said  quoting myself in 

25

Mohawk  that the inquiry should always be a practical

Alderson Reporting Company

17

one 

2

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

is part of the calculus? 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It is 
 and that efficiency 

The Court has said that 

6

there is a practical inquiry in one important respect, 

7

and that is the Court has broadened the notion of what 

8

could be an appealable final judgment.  But it has never 

9

denied the fact that when you decide the case, you 

10

resolve it, you terminate it as the district court does 

11

here.  That is a final judgment for the purposes of 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

it as narrowly as you do. 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That is, if you look at 

Your Honor, let me just 

15

in the MDL, these cases were brought together because 

16

there was a common factual allegation.  And that is that 

17

Mr. Waxman's clients manipulated LIBOR.  But we have a 

18

different complaint in a different docket with different 

19

plaintiffs and defendants, and the district court 

20

decided to dismiss our case.  I admit and I 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you asked  you 

asked to be part of the MDL case, didn't you? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes, that's correct.  In 

24

the  well, we filed in the Southern District of New 

25

York.  We asked to be part of the MDL litigation.  The

Alderson Reporting Company

18

district court initially said that we would be 


2


consolidated for all purposes and then recognized she 


3


could not do, that it would be consolidated only for 


4


pretrial purposes.  The pretrial purposes are now over. 

5

We were dismissed and therefore

judge says, this is how I'm going to rule, but I'm going 

10

to defer making the ruling. 

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

13

Yes. 

That party still is in 


the case 

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 

 and can participate in 


16

discovery.  Your strong point, I thought, was, here, 


17

they said I'm out of the case.  Can't participate in it 

18

anymore because I have no standing according to the 

19

district judge 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Right. 
 and yet I have to wait 

22

six years or however  however long the MDL proceedings 

23

go on.  So it says you're out, but you can't appeal. 

24
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes.  Now there  what 

district judges do in this circumstance, Your Honor, is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

that they stay the case that they believe will not go 

2

forward.  This is something that Judge Rakoff does with 

3

some regularity in complex litigation.  What he will say 

4

is my inclination is I'm going to ultimately say that 

5

the antitrust claims cannot go forward and what I'm 

6

going to do, therefore, is stay the antitrust claims 

7

and, therefore, you do not participate in discovery, for 

8

example. 

9

 But we do think it is important to recognize 

10

that there is a real reason for the appeals to go 

11

forward and that is, that it avoids duplicative 

12

discovery when we have to come back after appeal and 

13

there is the very real prospect of multiple appeals in 

14

multiple different courts after the MDL 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't understand that. 

16

That's arguing that they shouldn't exercise their 58(c). 

17

That's what Judge Rakoff is essentially doing.  He's 

18

saying, and you're saying, we shouldn't let them. 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

If he can say it for as 

long as he thinks is appropriate 

22

24

I'm sorry, Your Honor, no 

Yes. 
 what's the 

difference? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

What's the practical

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1
2

difference between the parties? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

In terms of the effect 

3

on you.  You're not going to participate in discovery 

4

under his system. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That's  that is correct. 

6

And so my point to the Court is the following:  And, 

7

that is, to the extent that members of the Court are 

8

concerned, that the district courts are concerned, the 

9

district judges that you cite, Justice Breyer, that we 

10

shouldn't have these interlocutory appeals, then the 

11

district courts have the tools to deal with that 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yeah, but what they tell 

13

us, these judges, who are experienced, I stress, on 

14

pages 12 and 13, "District courts have evaluated the 

15

Third Circuit factors," that is 54(b) factors, "in 

16

deciding whether to certify one among several 

17

consolidated cases for appeal."  Footnote, and then in 

18

the footnote they have several cases which I take it, 

19

since they tell us that, are cases where they were 

20

consolidated cases, they used 54(b) to say that one of 

21

the cases could go ahead on appeal. 

22

 Now, I took that as saying that judges are 

23

using 54(b) to accomplish the end that we seem 

24

apparently everyone wants, giving them the flexibility, 

25

and not the system that you propose.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

2

Breyer.  And here's 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4
5

That is not correct, Justice 

So are they wrong or I'm 

not reading it right?  Probably the latter. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

They  there is some  a 

6

piece of the puzzle that's missing, and that is that 

7

ours is the rule that for decades has been applied in 

8

the great majority of the country.  There are 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

In 54 ­ in fifty  in the 

10

majority of the country judges have said, when we have 

11

four cases in front of us, we have consolidated and we 

12

wish to dismiss one but keep the others going, they have 

13

said, we cannot use 54(b).  They have to have an appeal. 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, Justice Breyer.  What 

15

it  here's the situation.  In MDL litigation, which is 

16

consolidated 

17
18
19
20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm just talking about consolidated cases. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, if it's consolidated 

for all purposes, that's quite different.  You get 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

25

I'm not talking about MDL. 

Okay. 
 a single action. 
Okay.  Then talk about MDL. 
Okay.  MDL litigation, the 

rule is, as described in the cert papers, overwhelmingly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

in our favor, and that is the district courts enter 

2

judgments when they are prepared for the issue to go up 

3

on appeal.  The rule is, in the great majority of 

4

circuits, that if you do enter a judgment in an 

5

individual action in MDL litigation, you appeal.  And so 

6

district courts are perfectly aware of it. 

7

 We call it formal as if it were a bad thing 

8

that we have a final judgment rule, but it is not a bad 

9

thing.  It is really important to have clarity. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But if I could understand, 

11

Mr. Goldstein, what you're saying.  Do you think that a 

12

judge properly considers the exact same factors whether 

13

it's done as the Respondents would like under Rule 54, 

14

or instead, whether it's done your way by staying the 

15

action or by holding off on a final order? 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The answer to that question 

17

is I am agnostic on it.  My point is that to the extent 

18

that you all  that the Court agrees with Mr. Waxman's 

19

point, the district courts need that discretion, then 

20

our solution is simply to give them that discretion with 

21

respect to the entry of the final judgment.  It is not 

22

an argument against our position. 

23

 The argument for our position that I have 

24

not gotten to, and I do want to make sure we don't miss 

25

it, is that I am required under Rule 4 of the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

Rules of Appellate Procedure and Section 2107 of the 

2

statutes, to appeal within 30 days of the order or 

3

judgment that is affecting me.  At the end of the MDL, 

4

there is no such order or judgment.  The only thing that 

5

I can appeal from is the dismissal of my action.  I do 

6

not know, at the end of the MDL, what it is that I'm 

7

actually appealing from.  They have  the other problem 

8

that they have is that Rule 54(b) doesn't apply here 

9

because the entire act  you're going to have to change 

10

the meaning of what an action is throughout the  all 

11

of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which is uniformly the 

12

single piece of litigation, the single complaint, and 

13

there is no reason to create confusion. 

14

 Imagine after the ruling that Mr. Waxman 

15

wants, there are four cases in the district court, and 

16

they relate to the same sort of facts, and the district 

17

court dismisses one.  If you introduce this ambiguity 

18

about what an action is, then people are going to be 

19

unclear about when it is that they should be appealing. 

20

Because our lawsuit is a separate one; it is in a 

21

separate docket, we have a separate complaint. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Doesn't  doesn't it 

23

become clear once we announce it?  It's not like anybody 

24

involved in the MDL doesn't carefully know what's going 

25

on.  That's the advantage of those cases.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3

It does not. 
And there is an order. 

There's an order terminating the MDL 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Justice 
 and sending the cases 

6

that are going to be sent back, back, and the ones who are 

7

finalized, those are finalized. 

8

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Here's what happens.  And I 

9

suggest that the Court look at the docket, for example, 

10

in the Fontainebleau MDL, which is I think number 2106. 

11

So what happens here is that at the end of the 

12

proceedings, imagine the district court dismisses 

13

complaint A, that will be my complaint, and then later 

14

on complaints B and C settle.  So they are done.  They 

15

are voluntarily dismissed. 

16

 So there is no final judgment there. 

It 

17

could be years later.  What the district court will do 

18

is it will send a recommendation to the JPML saying I 

19

think that this case is over.  The JPML, which is not 

20

even in that circuit, will enter an order saying, we 

21

agree.  It is possible that the district court will just 

22

enter a notation in the main MDL docket saying the MDL 

23

is closed.  But that is not an order or judgment from 

24

which we are appealing.  It is not an order or judgment 

25

that affects us.  It's not a judgment at all.  It's just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1
2

an administrative notation. 
 This is a place where turning square corners 

3

matters, where you should apply the actual status and 

4

rules.  We don't need a new regime about what an action 

5

is, what a judgment is, what a final judgment is.  In 

6

order to in  accommodate the important policy concerns 

7

that Mr. Waxman may be raising, we don't have to change 

8

the meaning of Rule 54(b).  I have a lawsuit.  It has a 

9

judgment.  The district court judge decided to dismiss 

10
11

it.  I'm supposed to appeal. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If  if there's an MDL 

12

for pretrial purposes and the district court thinks that 

13

one  that some cases like yours just should not 

14

proceed, does the district judge have authority on its 

15

own to dismiss those few cases from the MDL?  Does he 

16

have that authority or does he have to go back to the 

17

MDL panel to do that? 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The district judge cannot 

19

the district judge can dismiss cases in the MDL and 

20

frequently does.  Now, administratively, if the district 

21

judge thinks that they just don't belong in the MDL 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That's my question. 
They will send a 

24

recommendation to the JPML.  Now, this is, I think, an 

25

important point.  And if I could just take you to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

Section ­ forty ­ fifty  the 1407, again, this is a case about a 

2

statute.  And this is going to be in the blue brief at 

3

page 2; the block quote is the MDL statute. 

4

 And the MDL statute makes quite clear that 

5

the actions inside the MDL are separate actions during 

6

the MDL.  And so what I recommend to you is the  if we 

7

go about halfway down, there is a sentence after the 

8

word "actions" that begins "Each action."  It's the line 

9

that and begins "Actions."  "Each action so transferred 

10

shall be remanded by the panel"  so it's a separate 

11

action,   "at or before the conclusion"  so "at or 

12

before the conclusion of such pretrial proceedings to 

13

the district from which it was transferred"  so that's 

14

when it begins or after it's done  "unless it shall 

15

have been previously terminated:  Provided, however," 

16

and this is the sentence that deals with during the MDL, 

17

that pan  "that the panel may separate any claim, 

18

crossclaim, counterclaim, or thirdparty claim and 

19

remand any of such claims before the remainder of the 

20

action is remanded." 

21

 The MDL statute provides for consolidated 

22

proceedings, that is, the district judge is going to 

23

bring the cases together, administer discovery together, 

24

enter orders.  Sometimes they'll apply to individual 

25

actions; sometimes it will apply to all of the actions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

But the relevant point is that they are separate 

2

actions.  They are actions that get initiated and at the 

3

end they get dismissed and it's called the final 

4

judgment rule, because it's a rule.  It's not called the 

5

semifinal constituent matter principle.  When our case 

6

gets dismissed, it's over and we are supposed to appeal. 

7

 If there are no further questions, I'll 

8

reserve the remainder of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Waxman. 

11

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

12

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 

13

 MR. WAXMAN: 

14

please the Court: 

15

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Let me start with what's now been the 

16

accepted terminology of the disingenuous approach to 

17

achieving the flexibility of the district court's need 

18

and to avoid the obligation that the courts of appeals 

19

must  because his rule requires immediate seriatim 

20

piecemeal appeals  hear those.  I have been calling it 

21

the  a form of guerilla judging, but the point is that 

22

the flexibility that both sides agree and the retired 

23

district judges certainly underscore that district 

24

courts need and the relief that the courts of appeals 

25

need from the obligation to hear seriatim piecemeal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

appeals, is achieved by application of the rule that was 

2

specifically designed for this, which is Rule 54(b). 

3

 Now, he says 54(b) doesn't apply. 

What that 

4

means is  let me just first start by saying, in this 

5

entire litigation, one and only one authority has been 

6

cited for that proposition. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

8

 MR. WAXMAN: 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, but that 
And that is Petitioner's brief. 
The text of 54(b) refers to 

10

a separate appeal for a claim, counterclaim, 

11

crossclaim, or thirdparty claim.  So your 54(b) 

12

argument, I think, is dependent on the proposition that 

13

Mr. Goldstein's complaint became part of a single 

14

action.  Otherwise, so  it was consolidate  it be 

15

became part of a single action and, therefore, it was 

16

it was tantamount to a claim. 

17

 MR. WAXMAN: 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
On that theory it could fit 

19

within 54(b).  That takes a little bit of  more than 

20

perhaps a little bit of pounding to fit that in there, 

21

don't you think? 

22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

No, I don't.  And neither does 

23

every single court that has construed the application of 

24

54(b) to consolidated litigation. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, how did  where do we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

look to find that  that his complaint became part of a 

2

single action? 

3

 MR. WAXMAN: 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, the 
The MDL statute doesn't 

5

doesn't make any reference to that.  Quite to the 

6

contrary. 

7

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Yes.  The MDL statute doesn't 

8

consolidate cases.  It transfers cases to a transferee 

9

MDL court for 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Where they remain 

11

separate actions, and Rule 54(b) was designed for a 

12

single action with multiple claims. 

13

 MR. WAXMAN: 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And my 
I don't see a single 

15

reference in the rule, nothing by the advisory committee 

16

that so much as suggests that a consolidation for 

17

pretrial purposes only makes it one action for purposes 

18

of 54(b). 

19

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Let me  before I get to 

20

the  to the terminology, let me just underscore  I 

21

realize this may be waving a red flag in front of this 

22

body, but there  not a single court or commentator 

23

anywhere has suggested that in consolidated cases, 

24

whether they are  that  that are all consolidated 

25

under Rule 42 whether they come in by an MDL or not,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

that  that action refers to the consolidated 

2

proceedings for such a length as they are consolidated. 

3

And, you know, Judge Ginsburg's  the other Ginsburg on 

4

the D.C. Circuit's opinion in  I think it's Hill v. 

5

Henderson, explains that it is a commonplace in 

6

consolidated actions for courts that want a piecemeal 

7

appeal to employ Rule 54(b). 

8
9
10
11
12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, you know, maybe 

they're wrong. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Now, it's possible that 

everyone is wrong. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, maybe they are wrong, 

13

Mr. Waxman, because I mean, they're  they're obviously 

14

looking for a certain kind of flexibility, which is 

15

important, and which I take it both sides have agreed is 

16

important.  But the question is whether they found it in 

17

the right section.  And I think what you're being asked 

18

is, if you just look at this section, this section is 

19

about multiparty, multiclaim single actions; that's what 

20

this section is all about.  And it's being used for a 

21

purpose for which it was never designed. 

22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

I think that is quite incorrect 

23

as an historical matter.  Rule 54(b) was the product of 

24

the Court's experience arising out of these multiple 

25

mass actions, particularly exemplified in the Electric

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

Equipment Antitrust Litigation, and that's all over the 

2

legislative history of Rule 54(b) where 54(b) and 1407 

3

don't  didn't exist at the time, and were enacted in 

4

the wake of that. 

5

 And the  what the legislative history 

6

shows is that these four, 50  I guess 54(b) was in 

7

existence but not 1407.  54(b) was the mechanism in 

8

those consolidated actions by which particular issues of 

9

law were reviewed by the courts of appeals 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

12

 MR. WAXMAN: 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But in this 
Not any 
 were not. 
But in this  in this 

14

case, at the end of the day, the actions are, in effect, 

15

unconsolidated.  When  when the pretrial M  MDL 

16

is  is completed here, the separate judgments will be 

17

remanded to the separate courts.  So you're  what 

18

you're saying is, well, it's one action for a while, but 

19

then it's many actions again.  Begins as many, then it's 

20

one for a while, then it's going to be many again. 

21

Isn't that  isn't that the dynamic that you're 

22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

That  that is exactly the 

23

dynamic for whatever length of time the consolidation 

24

occurs. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But his last point, this in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

my mind is that if we take your route  one problem 

2

with his route  one problem with your route is you 

3

have to muck around with the word "action."  Well, you 

4

do.  I mean, there's no doubt you do.  You have to 

5

consider it a single action while it's consolidated. 

6

 One problem with his route is that, A, 

7

nobody's ever done it, they've all thought you're right, 

8

and nobody's said much about it.  And one problem with 

9

his route is you treat consolidations where the 

10

multidistrict panel is involved and you consolidate it 

11

for discovery differently than you treat consolidations 

12

in an ordinary district court, has four cases and 

13

consolidates them.  That's the problem with his route. 

14

 So it seems to me a sort of balance there. 

15

But one thing he said that I don't  that did register 

16

is he said if we take your route, what happens when the 

17

multidistrict is over, see.  Eight months ago, his case 

18

was dismissed, and a judgment was entered in his  in 

19

his case, which is now only part of the case, on your 

20

theory. 

21

 When is he supposed  what is he appealing 

22

from?  When did the 30day clock begin to run?  And 

23

suppose, by the way, it was never sent  it was never 

24

really sent back because everybody else settled.  How 

25

does that work?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, let me just make  I 

2

have your question firmly in mind.  I want to just 

3

observe two things about the premises to your question. 

4

One is that 3 percent of cases that are consolidated 

5

under the  of MDL cases get returned to districts for 

6

trial.  The overwhelming majority never leave the 

7

transferee courts. 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, that's because the 

parties, either they get dismissed pretrial, or they 

10

settle, or the parties agree that the transferee court 

11

can be the trial court.  But at no  no one in a 

12

multidistrict litigation can be forced into going before 

13

the transferee court for trial. 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That  that's 
And I think it was quite 

16

clear that Congress didn't give multidistrict forum the 

17

option to be the trial court. 

18

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Justice Ginsburg, I totally 

19

agree.  And if there were any ambiguity, this Court's 

20

unanimous decision in Lexecon made that clear. 

21

 The point is that it is up to the transferee 

22

judge, as it is up to any judge in a civil case, using 

23

the tools provided under rule 42 to decide how to manage 

24

all of the cases that have been transferred.  The judge 

25

may decide to let them  proceed  only a couple of them, let

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

me them all proceed on their own.  The judge may 

2

consolidate them, which is a formal act that has a known 

3

meaning and has real world consequences not just with 

4

respect to finality but with respect to the compromise 

5

of the individual litigant's rights during the period in 

6

which consolidation occurs. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: But these statutes do not 

8

speak of consolidation of cases, they speak of 

9

consolidated proceedings.  Where  where do you get the 

10

notion that the cases have been consolidated?  And if 

11

that notion were true, surely the consolidation must 

12

terminate when one of the cases is dismissed, how can it 

13

still be consolidated when it's dismissed and the other, 

14

and the other cases are proceeding. 

15

 MR. WAXMAN: 

I'm not quibbling at all, 

16

Justice Scalia, with the language.  I'm perfectly happy 

17

to say that the proceedings are consolidated.  The point 

18

here um is 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

It makes a big difference. 
Well, the  I don't  I think 

21

it doesn't really make a big difference.  The point here 

22

is, as this Court has repeatedly admonished, what 

23

constitutes a final decision under section 1291 is not a 

24

technical concept but, rather, quote, "the means to 

25

achieving a healthy legal system and that does not"

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So please answer Justice 

2

Breyer's question, because that is  troubling me as well, 

3

at what moment, and if it's a notation from  if it's a 

4

settled case, when does he appeal? 

5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

The  the  the appeal period 

6

runs from the time that all of the  that there is 

7

that all of the other consolidated proceedings, cases, 

8

have resolved or been transferred, and so 

9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What does he appeal 

from?  I mean 

11

 MR. WAXMAN: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Excuse me? 
There is an awkwardness 

13

here, because he's not appealing from the judgment 

14

entered on behalf of or against the other parties. 

15

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Let's be very, very clear about 

16

what he says he's appealing from.  The only document 

17

that he has pointed to that suggests that he had a 

18

judgment way back in March of 2013 is entry 43 in the 

19

Gelboim docket, which is reproduced on Page 11A of the 

20

joint appendix. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

He has the word of the 

22

district judge you have an appeal of right, that's what 

23

she said. 

24
25

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, what she said in 

adjudicating the request by other parties for a 54(b)

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

certification, this is on Page 220 of the petition 

2

appendix is that these plaintiffs and the Schwab 

3

plaintiffs have an appeal of right, there is no question 

4

that she misapprehended the rule in the Second Circuit 

5

that just because she had dismissed all of the claims in 

6

their suit they have an appeal of right.  But the notion 

7

that she entered a judgment 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

She thought that she 

9

needed to the to do the 54(b) for the other cases that 

10

had more than one claim, not just the antitrust claim. 

11

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Correct, and let me say 

12

something about their subsequent motion under  the 

13

Gelboim subsequent motion under 54(b) after the 

14

dismissal for lack of jurisdiction by the court of 

15

appeals, but first point out to you that the order that 

16

she's referring to, 43, which says that the case is 

17

terminated pursuant to instructions from chambers, you 

18

know, I wondered, well, why isn't there anything in the 

19

docket that in fact terminates it, and the answer is on 

20

page  pages 15 through 19 of the joint appendix where, 

21

as you can see on Page 19, she has reissued the same 

22

memorandum and order as modified, three days later. 

23

 And the language that they like to cite for 

24

the notion that there was a judgment in their case is 

25

missing.  And that's why they, in fact, continue to be a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1
2

party to the consolidated 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, then you're just 

3

let's go back to my question.  I agree with you, I'd 

4

always learned like Hornbook rule number 1 is, there is 

5

a separate piece of paper called a judgment entered by 

6

the district court, and that is what you appeal from. 

7

Now you have just told me, there isn't one here, in 

8

which case he can't appeal, okay, that's a separate 

9

reason.  I'm now assuming another case.  The case is, 

10

there is a separate piece of paper in his case called a 

11

judgment.  His point is, that gives me a piece of paper 

12

called a judgment to appeal from, it was entered at a 

13

certain time and now I know when the clock starts. 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right, yes. 
Now, what I said  was, 

16

some time ago, that I thought he had a point, is in such 

17

a case, if we treat the consolidation of 

18

proceedings like we treat a consolidation of cases 

19

without the multidistrict, he cannot appeal from that 

20

piece of paper.  He has to wait in the ordinary 

21

situation, not multidistrict, until there is another 

22

piece of paper resolving everything, then he starts to 

23

appeal but at least he has a piece of paper which maybe 

24

he lacked here.  All right, now, he's saying here in the 

25

multidistrict situation, there will be a separate piece

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

of paper, I can't appeal from, what is the piece of 

2

paper from which I know the clock on appeal begins to 

3

run? 

4
5
6

7
8

9
10

 MR. WAXMAN: 

The same piece of paper that he 

lacks even to this day. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's a red herring at the 

moment. 

MR. WAXMAN: Well okay but, et me at least finish my 
sentence. 

At the end, when the district judge 

11

certifies that the consolidation period is over, whether 

12

that's, you know, at the end of discovery or at the end 

13

of pretrial proceedings or in a case under rule 42 at 

14

the end of the trial of the case, or a case, the parties 

15

will seek to the extent the court has not entered it, 

16

under rule 58 a separate piece of paper that says either 

17

judgment or that's the functional equivalent of judgment 

18

under rule, under rule 54(A), which says a judgment is 

19

an appealable order. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Waxman, have you made 

21

this argument before, did you make this argument in 

22

opposition to the petition for certiorari, namely that 

23

there was no final judgment here. 

24
25

 MR. WAXMAN: 

We did, and it got discouraged 

when the Court granted cert.  But I mean, I'm not here

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

just making a jurisdictional argument, my point in this 

2

case is 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Waxman, the Second 

4

Circuit didn't think that there was a problem because 

5

the  a judgment hadn't been entered.  They said in all 

6

of these cases when a consolidated or pretrial, there is 

7

no right of appeal, you have to get permission under 

8

rule 54(b).  They did not say anything about the problem 

9

in this case is that there was no judgment document. 

10

And isn't there, I know that there  there is a 

11

provision that says, if the judgment  if for some 

12

reason you don't have the piece of paper, that's not 

13

fatal. 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Justice Ginsburg, I 

15

respectfully suggest that you're mistaken in reading 

16

what the Second Circuit said.  This is on Page 2A of the 

17

petitioner appendix and what it says is, this court has 

18

determined sua sponte that it lacks jurisdiction over 

19

these appeals because a final order has not been issued 

20

by the district court as contemplated by section 1291, 

21

comma, and the orders of  the orders appealed from did 

22

not dispose of all the claims in the consolidated 

23

action.  The court 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Are you telling me that 

the Second Circuit doesn't have that rule if there is a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1
2

piece of paper that says judgment on it? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

The piece of  the Second 

3

Circuit's rule, which is the rule we think that ought to 

4

be applied throughout the country is that the  when 

5

there is  when all of the claims of a party or, in 

6

a  in any multi claim, multidistrict proceeding, 

7

whether it's a single consolidated complaint or 

8

consolidated proceedings, judgment is entered by 

9

district courts when a rule 54(b)(1) certification is 

10

made, or, assuming the court of appeals agrees, when 

11

there is a recommendation under section 1292(b).  That 

12

is 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

But aren't 
 the way courts issue 

15

judgments during the period of consolidation when the 

16

other cases are proceeding. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

18

Well, 1292(b) can't be 

applicable here. 

19

 MR. WAXMAN: 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

No, it's not. 
1292(b) is when you don't 

21

have a final judgment.  It's an interlocutory appeal, 

22

the typical case for 1292(b) is the court decides 

23

liability, but it hasn't decided damages yet.  You can't 

24

run upstairs at that point unless you get a 1292(b) 

25

order.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

 MR. WAXMAN: 

You are absolutely right, and I 

2

stand corrected.  My point is that during the period, 

3

when there are multi claim, multiparty proceedings, 

4

either because they are different cases that are 

5

consolidated for a period of consolidation or a single 

6

omnibus complaint which could have happened in this 

7

case, a ruling as to all the claims of a particular 

8

party or all of the parties as to a particular claim 

9

becomes a judgment when and only when the district court 

10
11

certifies a judgment under 54(b). 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but that's quite 

12

different.  You were defending the proposition, I 

13

thought, that the Second Circuit said that there had 

14

been no final judgment in this case.  Not in the 

15

consolidated cases but no final judgment in this case. 

16

And I don't read that  that order on  on Page 2A as 

17

saying anything other than that there's not been a final 

18

order under  under 1291 because all the cases have not 

19

been disposed of. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, I guess, you know, we can 

21

speculate about what they meant.  They didn't say 

22

because, they said there's no final order under 1291, 

23

and all of the cases in the consolidated proceedings 

24

haven't been disposed of.  But let me just make one 

25

point.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

strange way to read that. 

3

 MR. WAXMAN: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, I  that's a very 

I mean, our  look 
Given the opinion of 
My case isn't turning on what 

6

actually happened here, but I think in thinking about 

7

the meaning of "final decision" under 1291, which 

8

doesn't use the word "action" what a final decision is, 

9

with an eye toward what is a healthy legal system, this 

10

case, I think  I think it's important to focus on just 

11

the features of this case as one of many, many examples 

12

why the rule that they're advocating is not correct. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You raised the argument 

14

before us this morning that there wasn't a final 

15

judgment and Petitioner argues that there was under Rule 

16

58(c)(2)(b) and you didn't address that, I believe, in 

17

your brief.  So what is wrong with that argument? 

18

 MR. WAXMAN: 

19

 Well, the 58(c)(2)(b) is 150 days from the, 

58(c)(2)(b). 

20

quote, judgment that's reflected in 58(b), and 58(b)(1) 

21

in particular says, you know, entering judgment without 

22

the court's direction.  And it says that if a court 

23

issues an order otherwise  unless the court orders 

24

otherwise, the clerk has to enter a written judgment. 

25

 But the caveat there, which does apply in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

this case for reasons because this does involve  these 

2

consolidated proceedings are an action within the 

3

meaning of 54, is that 58(b)(1) is, quote, "subject to 

4

54(b)." 

5

 Now, in terms of  let me just make the 

6

point I was trying to make before, which is, look 

7

exactly at what the Petitioner is trying to do in this 

8

case, just as an example of what a healthy judicial 

9

system is. 

10

 They say that they're entitled to  they're 

11

required immediately to appeal and the Second Circuit is 

12

obligated immediately to consider their appeal, 

13

notwithstanding, among other things, two things in 

14

particular; one, even as we are  the Court is 

15

considering this case, the district judge is considering 

16

claims by the Plaintiffs in seven other consolidated 

17

cases that have raised Sherman Act claims that, in fact, 

18

her prior ruling on Sherman Act antitrust injury does 

19

not apply to them.  The briefing on those motions, on 

20

that issue, will be completed, I believe, on Christmas 

21

Eve, and so if an appeal had been proceeding, the Second 

22

Circuit would be considering precisely the same thing 

23

that the judge is reconsidering, and the cases are 

24

legion in which 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that would

Official

44
1

seem to be very efficient.  It would save her the 

2

difficulty of reconsidering it if the Second Circuit 

3

rules one way or another. 

4

 It seems to me that the efficiency arguments 

5

in these cases, you know, they can go either way and 

6

probably do go either way depending upon the nature of 

7

the case.  It would be very efficient, would save her 

8

the time to reconsider it, if she had a ruling from the 

9

Second Circuit. 

10

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Just to be clear, Mr. Chief 

11

Justice, what she's considering are not requests to 

12

reconsider.  She denied those a year ago August.  These 

13

are Plaintiffs who claim that their antitrust claims 

14

are, in their mind, significantly different than the 

15

claims that Gelboim brought. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay.  I thought you 

17

were making the other point.  So the claims that she's 

18

looking at really are not affected by the Gelboim 

19

claims. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

That's right, although 

it to appeal? 

23

 MR. WAXMAN: 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

Then what problem is 

Excuse me? 
Then what's the 

problem with going ahead with the Gelboim appeal?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, the problem with going 

2

ahead with the Gelboim appeal is the inefficiency and 

3

the lack  and the threat to the 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it's a different 

5

reason.  She said in the Gelboim case you have no 

6

antitrust injury.  In other words, you have no standing, 

7

out the door.  And you say the other cases are different 

8

from that.  Is  they don't center on antitrust injury? 

9

 MR. WAXMAN: 

No, they do.  They are claiming 

10

that we  notwithstanding your prior ruling in the 

11

circumstances of our cases, we do have antitrust injury, 

12

and from a point of view of a healthy judicial system, 

13

you would want the court of appeals to be able to 

14

consider the question of antitrust injury after the 

15

district judge has finally come to a concluded view as 

16

to all of the consolidated cases. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I think what the Chief 

18

Justice is indicating is to the extent that the issues, 

19

the claims are the same, the efficiency argument can cut 

20

both ways; to the extent that the claims are different, 

21

what's the problem with an appeal? 

22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, the  the court of 

23

appeals is being asked to consider the  the 

24

sufficiency of the allegations as to antitrust injury 

25

with respect to a common core of  of ­ of a alleged

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1
2
3
4

facts, a course of conduct, and different parties 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But is that the only thing, 

that they're going to have to learn the facts twice? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, there  look, you can 

5

always argue that there are certain efficiencies in 

6

taking immediate piecemeal appeals.  Our system, since 

7

the Judiciary Act of 1789, has set its sight against 

8

that and said that piecemeal appeals are disfavored. 

9
10

 Another feature of this very case 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if the district judge 

11

had been right the first time, she said I have a claim 

12

that's totally been dismissed, it's out, then there are 

13

these other people that have antitrust claims and other 

14

claims, so what I'm going to do is this, final judgment 

15

for the one that has no other claims, 54(b) on the 

16

antitrust claims for the others so that the Second 

17

Circuit will then hear antitrust standing all at once. 

18

 MR. WAXMAN: 

And the  the point is that 

19

there are other parties in the consolidated pre 

20

pleadings that say that their claims and their 

21

Plaintiffs stand in a different position under the 

22

Sherman Act with respect to antitrust injury than 

23

Gelboim does, and why wouldn't a healthy system 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, the district judge 

obviously didn't think so because she said, I'm  one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

party has an appeal of right and I am going to do the 

2

54(b) order for the others. 

3

 MR. WAXMAN: 

She didn't consider, Justice 

4

Ginsburg, the seven parties that are now claiming that 

5

they are different.  She was only considering the 

6

application by certain other parties for a 54(b) 

7

certification. 

8

 And if you look at what the judge did after 

9

the Second Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction, I 

10

think it's pretty revealing.  Mr.  Ms. Gelboim's 

11

lawyers and the lawyers of the parties who previously 

12

had had a 54(b) certification went back to the judge and 

13

said, okay, there was  the Second Circuit thinks that 

14

there wasn't a final order, but it would be great to 

15

have the court of appeals decide the antitrust injury 

16

issue, please issue a 54(b) certification.  And here is 

17

what the judge said.  This is on Page 294 of the joint 

18

appendix:  Quote, This case has a wonderful host of 

19

interesting issues.  We could send six different issues 

20

up to the circuit.  We're not doing that seriatim, we're 

21

going to clean up this complaint, we're not picking and 

22

choosing particular questions and sending them up. 

23

 And at the end of that hearing, the counsel 

24

for some of the Plaintiffs with Sherman Act claims said, 

25

well, when you get done resolving  when you get done

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

cleaning up the complaint and resolving the issues as 

2

the pleading disputes, would you then con  would you 

3

then grant a 54(b) certification?  And she said, I'm not 

4

prepared to rule on that at this moment.  And obviously 

5



6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, there's 

7

efficiencies  there's efficiency to the system and you 

8

have arguments about that, but there's also fairness to 

9

the parties.  I mean, how many years are these people, 

10

whose case is done as far as the District Court is 

11

concerned, supposed to sit around and wait for the big 

12

fish to resolve their cases? 

13

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, the  the  it is a 

14

feature of the rule against piecemeal litigation that 

15

individual litigants sometimes have to wait.  But what 

16

is particularly 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That just kind of 

18

begs the question whether this is piecemeal or not for 

19

these people. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, I think here's the point, 

21

there is no case, they have found not a single case in 

22

46 years of MDL litigation where any party in their 

23

position or a similar position has had to wait an 

24

inordinate amount of time and that is because in 

25

appropriate cases, whether the cases are consolidated

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

for all purposes or some limited purpose, the courts 

2

exercised their discretion under Rule 54(b). 

3

 It has never happened that someone in their 

4

position has had to re  has been required to wait for 

5

years and years, at least neither we nor they, who I'm 

6

confident have scoured the record of MDLs, in fact, has 

7

done this.  And 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, then that sort of 

contradicts what you said before.  You said she wasn't 

10

going to deal with these things piecemeal.  By the way, 

11

on that point, she said, given the reaction of the 

12

Second Circuit more than once, it's time to give up. 

13

She said that first, as  as far as that's 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

I think, Justice Ginsburg, that 

15

the point I wanted to make here is she has left fully 

16

open the possibility that when she finishes resolving 

17

the pleading problems, including the claims of the other 

18

seven Sherman Act plaintiffs who say they're different, 

19

she will reconsider whether to grant Rule 54(b). 

20

 And while I, you know, my  my friend on 

21

the other side says, well, there is  you know, there 

22

are all sorts of obscure procedural mechanisms where you 

23

could get this flexibility, the point here is that we 

24

have a rule that has already been made to deal with the 

25

resolution of all the claims of a party or all the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

parties of a claim which is 54(b) and 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3

 MR. WAXMAN: 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But to what  what 
 the advantage of 
What is obscure about a 

5

stay?  Multidistrict cases have lots and lots of issues, 

6

and quite often stays of some cases are issued.  That's 

7

not 

8

 MR. WAXMAN: 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

10

Here 

 MR. WAXMAN: 

 obscure. 
Here's the difference.  The 

11

difference is that under the  under the stay regime, 

12

the status quo, that is the presumption is that 

13

piecemeal appeals will go forward unless the district 

14

judge affirmatively acts.  Under the regime, as we 

15

understand it, and as all courts and commentators have 

16

understood it, the pros  the appeal will not go 

17

forward unless the district court makes the two findings 

18

that Rule 54(b) requires.  One is that there really is a 

19

final order or final decision; and, second, that there 

20

is no just cause for delay, and it is that discipline, 

21

that focus, that the rules place on the party that 

22

benefit the system.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Excuse me.  You believe 

that the notation on 11a is the final judgment you're 
speaking about? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I do, and this goes to 

12

Justice Scalia's point and the questions that were asked 

13

at oral argument.  This argument was raised in the brief 

14

in opposition whether we did have an appealable 

15

judgment.  We addressed it in Footnote 1 of our cert. 

16

reply brief, and we were so obviously right that this is 

17

governed by Rule 58(c) that the respondents abandoned 

18

this argument in the merits brief.  The district said 

19

our action is terminated and we have an appeal as a 

20

matter of right. 

21

 That was quite plainly the judgment. 

We 

22

appealed within 150 days after that.  So this  you 

23

considered this fully, I am sure, because if 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You addressed it where, 

Footnote 1 of 

Alderson Reporting Company

52
1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Footnote 1 of the brief 

2

in  excuse me, our reply brief on cert.  We have only 

3

one footnote. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay. 
And we discuss at length 

6

their concession that there was a final judgment, what 

7

it is the Second Circuit did, why it is terminating as a 

8

judgment, all of those points.  This was presented to 

9

you.  And we were so plainly right that they didn't even 

10

make the argument in their merits brief.  It's still 

11

jurisdictional, but there quite clearly was a 

12

termination of the action that the district court 

13

understood was appealable.  That's why Rule 58 exists. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15

your other three points 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

18
19
20

And what are  what are 

Okay. 
 that make you plainly 

right on the rest of the case? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That was actually the first 

point. 

21

 The second one goes to Justice Breyer's 

22

concern that no one thinks that we are right.  And 

23

just  and Mr. Waxman's point that, oh, everyone 

24

understoods  understands, every commentator, that this 

25

is done under Rule 54(b), that is, in a word,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53

ridiculous.  Ours is the rule in the overwhelming 

2

majority of the country and has been for decades.  Every 

3

time 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Excuse me, what is that 

word. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I'll give you two kinds of 

7

case cites.  The cert. petition cites all the cases in 

8

the court of appeals 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  Okay. 
 including the D.C. 

11

circuit, that say when you enter the judgment in the 

12

individual action, it's appealable.  I have given you 

13

the 1935 MDL that uses the 58(b) example. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay. 
But as Justice Ginsburg 

16

indicates, it's commonplace for MDL courts to enter 

17

stays and put act  individual actions on ice without 

18

entering judgments.  The system, as we describe it, has 

19

been working for decades without any difficulty. 

20

 And, Justice Ginsburg, my third preliminary 

21

point is that when Mr. Waxman says there are all of 

22

these other actions out there, it is a little bit of an 

23

optical illusion.  When this district court entered this 

24

opinion which resulted in our judgment, she entered the 

25

same order in every other single pending case.  She was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

quite clear that it applied to all of the cases in the 

2

MDL.  She denied reconsideration, explained that no one 

3

could have antitrust standing. 

4

 If there are other unrelated antitrust 

5

claims, then there's no problem with our appeal. 

6

 Now, my big point is that there is no reason 

7

for you to muck about with and cause confusion in the 

8

law with respect to what a final judgment is, what an 

9

action is, what a  what a constituent matter in an 

10

action is, when we can address all of his policy 

11

concerns in the way that MDL courts have been doing for 

12

decades.  There is going to be considerable confusion 

13

that results. 

14

 What are we supposed to appeal from? 

15

Justice Breyer, if you know the answer to your question 

16

which you asked three times at the  at the end of this 

17

argument, you are alone, I believe.  I do not know what 

18

it is that I am supposed to appeal from, particularly if 

19

some of the cases settle.  What is a  it's called the 

20

Final Judgment Rule.  We have a final judgment in our 

21

action. 

22

 Imagine the following forms of confusion. 

23

What happens with American Pipe tolling?  When was our 

24

action dismissed?  Therefore, some other individual 

25

person is required to file an individual lawsuit.  What

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

happens when you have multiple lawsuits that are 

2

together that look alike?  Are those now a single 

3

action?  What if the different lawsuits are coordinated 

4

rather than consolidated?  Because, remember, the three 

5

Schwab lawsuits were consolid  coordinated here, not 

6

consolidated.  What do those people do? 

7

 Why is it that you want to create a regime 

8

that creates all of these doubts that has a new Final 

9

Judgment Rule, a new definition of action, despite the 

10

uniform meaning in all of the civil procedures, that 

11

will create just followon confusion when I have offered 

12

you the simple solution, and that is the district judge 

13

will enter a final judgment in the action if the 

14

district judge wants it to be appealable? 

15

 If the district judge 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

His is  basically 

17

you're saying are there any other mechanisms for the 

18

district court to get to where it wants?  A rakeoff, 

19

don't enter anything. 

20
21
22
23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Don't enter  enter 

anything. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Stay and don't enter 

under 58.  Tell the court 

24

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
 the clerk of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1
2

court not to enter it? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Under  under 42 create a 

3

consolidated complaint as was done here with the OTC and 

4

exchange actions.  That's actually very common.  And 

5

that is the MDL court will say, I have four lawsuits in 

6

front of me.  I am, under Rule 42, going to consolidate 

7

them into a single master complaint.  That master 

8

complaint will have four different claims in it.  And 

9

then the district court will simply resolve one of the 

10

claims in the master action without entering a judgment 

11

in the individual action  not the master action, the 

12

master complaint.  It's not actually an action.  There's 

13

an MDL docket, a main MDL docket, and the district court 

14

just doesn't enter a judgment in the individual 

15

action 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can that be done when 

17

it's consolidated only for purposes of pretrial 

18

discovery? 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It can.  It is what's 

20

known  there's a Sixth Circuit case called Refrigerant 

21

that discusses this issue and a Second Circuit case 

22

called Katz.  It is called an administrative complaint. 

23

The district court uses this administrative complaint to 

24

manage the litigation, and that administrative complaint 

25

doesn't have the same docket as the individual actions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

And the district court is perfectly capable of saying, 

2

I'm going to resolve the antitrust claim  not an 

3

action, an antitrust claim  inside this larger 

4

administrative complaint without entering a judgment. 

5

And when there is no judgment, there's no appeal.  And 

6

you can announce that rule and give the district courts 

7

the flexibility that the retired district judges want 

8

without creating all this necessary docck here trial. 

9

As you say, Justice Sotomayor, district judges pay a lot 

10

of attention to your rulings.  They will know what it is 

11

that they are supposed to do, and we just don't have a 

12

mess later on. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I don't see anything in 

14

the rules about it, and this is the first time I've 

15

heard about this administrative 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 
 complaint. 
The administrative 

19

complaints are the most common tools the district judges 

20

use in MDL litigation.  I suggest the  the Refrigerant 

21

and Katz cases do explain it.
