ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Chief Judge Sentelle observed in his dissent

12

below that there are assignments and there are

13

assignments, and that's essentially going to be the

14

theme of my presentation this morning.

15

common ground between the parties in this litigation

16

that if you have an assignment which represents the

17

grant of the entirety of both the right and the remedy,

18

that is the complete assignment of the chosen action,

19

then under those circumstances there's no question that

20

the assignee has standing under Article III.

21

It is I think

By parity of receiving, if all that the

22

assignee receives is a power of attorney, a mere

23

collection agency role, under those circumstances I

24

think it's common ground between the parties that

25

Article III is not satisfied.

Two of the data points

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

come from --

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Say it again?

What is the

common ground?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the second part of

5

the common ground is that if all that the assignee

6

receives is the power of attorney, that is to serve as

7

the lawyer for the assignor, under those circumstances

8

the assignee doesn't -- cannot -- has no common stake

9

than I or my clients do in these particular cases, any

10

more than I do in my client's interest in these

11

particular cases, and there I don't think anybody

12

disputes that Article III is not satisfied.

13

Now, the Court in Vermont Agency sort of

14

identified two additional data points.

15

made clear that a 10 percent bounty by itself unattached

16

to anything else is not sufficient, largely I think for

17

the same reasons why the lawyer's claim is insufficient,

18

because that's not tied to the particular right at stake

19

and therefore is inadequate to allow Article III to the

20

satisfied.

21

First of all, it

The second half of it is, though, that if

22

that bounty is coupled with an assignment of the rights

23

and even if that's a partial assignment of the rights,

24

then there is Article III jurisdiction under those

25

circumstances.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that if these

2

contracts provided that the aggregators will turn over

3

all of the proceeds of the litigation except for one

4

penny, then you'd be satisfied?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I'm not sure I'd be

6

satisfied.

I think there's a different -- I think the

7

answer is that might satisfy Article III.

8

reason I'm reluctant to say that that's the line that

9

ought to be drawn is because this Court's taxpayer

The only

10

standing cases seems to recognize that there are

11

situations where there is a sufficiently de minimis

12

amount of at stake that under those circumstances

13

Article III won't be satisfied.

14

cleanest line to draw is in circumstances where have you

15

no stake in the outcome that clearly is beyond what

16

Article III would ultimately do.

But clearly the

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

really a very significant case, is it?

19

presume that these enterprises that agglomerate claims

20

and bring suit as a collection agency, they could simply

21

get their compensation, instead of by way of, of a flat

22

fee, by, you know, claiming entitlement to 2 percent of

23

the rewards.

24
25

Well then, this is not
Because I

So it's no big deal, I mean, really.
MR. PHILLIPS:

But it is a big deal, not

necessarily because of the importance of the article.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think the Article III part of it is still a big deal.

2

think requiring as a separation of powers matter that

3

there has to be a concrete stake in the party bringing

4

the litigation, that's an important principle and the

5

Court shouldn't abandon it, and that's posed directly in

6

this case.

7

I

But more fundamentally in terms of the

8

importance of the underlying process, remember here

9

we're talking about an assignee who takes on 1400

10

different assignor claims involving 400,000 pay phones.

11

And that's the problem, is that when you break this down

12

and you allow just simple assignments to satisfy Article

13

III in its prudential standing concerns, then what you

14

end up with is this mass tort litigation.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it would be just the

16

same, Mr. Phillips, would it not, if the arrangement was

17

that the aggregator gets a piece of the action?

18

take out the de minimis one cent.

19

like the qui tam plaintiff has.

20

same problems that you're complaining about with regard

21

to discovery from the individual PSPs, the same problem

22

with respect to counterclaim.

23

Let's

A significant stake,
So you would have the

That's -- so it seems to me that, as Justice

24

Scalia suggested, this isn't about a whole lot if just

25

by the device of giving the aggregator part of the, a
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

piece of the action, this suit would be okay because the

2

prudential objections that you are making here would

3

apply just as well.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, and I would -- I would

5

still assert those same prudential objections in the

6

hypothetical you pose.

7

when you have an assignment and there is a bounty built

8

into it, however you want to define the bounty, whether

9

it's a penny or 10 percent or 2 percent or whatever,

What I'm saying is when you --

10

that may satisfy Article III.

11

does not answer the question of whether there's

12

prudential standing under those circumstances.

13

--

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

I understand that.

That

In that

Go ahead, I'm sorry.
In that context, Justice

16

Ginsburg, you do have the problems.

17

discovery.

18

counterclaim process, and there are serious questions

19

about whether or not there are res judicata and

20

collateral estoppel effects, and I would argue in that

21

context that there's a very significant claim that those

22

proceedings ought not to be entertained by a Federal

23

court as a prudential matter, not as a matter of Article

24

III.

25

You don't get the

You don't get to use the efficiency of the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if all of the
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

claimants assign their claims to something called an

2

agglomeration trust and the -- the person who's bringing

3

suit here brings it as a trustee?

4

it personally and he is compensated the same way, the

5

same way this agglomerator is compensated.

6

personal interest.

7

He has no interest in

He has no

He could sue, couldn't he?

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, there is a long

8

tradition of allowing trustees to bring litigation on

9

behalf of the trust because that's the only way that a

10

trust can in fact enforce its rights.

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:
deal.

13

So once again, it's no big

I mean -MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it is a big deal,

14

because trust relationships carry all kinds of

15

additional legal consequences.

16

offensive about this arrangement, Your Honors, is that

17

the assignor gets all of the benefits of being able to

18

bring mass tort litigation with none of the

19

responsibilities.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What is particularly

He would do the same thing

21

in Justice Scalia's if it were an irrevocable trust.

22

The trust could do exactly what the aggregator is doing

23

here.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's true, but there are

additional trust responsibilities that would attach to
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that process.

2

with that.

3

There's an entire legal regime to deal

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- that might protect those

4

who assigned their interest to the trust, but I don't

5

offhand see what difference it would make, what

6

difference those responsibilities would make vis a vis

7

you and your client.

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, again, Justice Souter,

I think the answer probably is going to depend on how

10

the Court interprets the prudential standing doctrine.

11

Again, I don't have any quarrel as an Article III

12

matter, because I think it's one of those long-held

13

traditions that trustees are allowed to bring litigation

14

on behalf of the trust and that's understood.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the real issue is not

16

whether the trustee can sue.

17

the trust can sue.

18
19

MR. PHILLIPS:

The real issue is whether

Right.

I mean, that's where

the claims are, sure.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It seems to me in his

21

example if the trust can sue, why can't the aggregator

22

sue?

23

responsibilities.

24

responsibilities inure to the benefit of your client or

25

to an opposing party in litigation that a trust brings.

And your answer was, well, trustees have certain
But I don't see that those

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So I don't see how it would differentiate it.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there are two

3

differentiations.

4

legal regime that regulates trusts and that has allowed

5

the courts for 200 years, probably longer than that, to

6

be comfortable to allow litigation to proceed in a

7

particular way.

8
9

One is that there is this entire

But second of all and the second answer to
your first question is the prudential concerns remain

10

just, potentially just as serious.

11

is do you want to create litigation devices that allow

12

the courts to avoid -- to allow lower courts or, more to

13

the point, allow plaintiffs to avoid the requirements

14

either of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or the

15

associational standing doctrine.

16

that are designed to limit mass tort litigation in

17

particularized circumstances --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think the question

Those are doctrines

You mentioned discovery.

19

I don't see why you can't get discovery against this

20

whole bunch of people.

21
22

MR. PHILLIPS:
to the litigation.

23
24
25

Because they're not a party

I mean, you can get discovery --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Subpoenas out there and

depositions.
MR. PHILLIPS:

But, Justice Stevens, if you
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sue me, you hail me into court, you put me to the

2

burdens of being a defendant in litigation, the least I

3

ought to get out of that is that I can turn to you and

4

ask you to admit certain facts, I can turn to you and

5

ask you to answer certain interrogatories, and I don't

6

have to go chasing you down, because you've already

7

submitted yourself to the personal jurisdiction of that

8

court.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, in this

10

particular situation you can do the same thing.

11

file requests for admissions or serve interrogatories.

12

I don't understand why you can't do that.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

You can

Well, I can serve them on the

14

aggregator, but I cannot serve them on the party who in

15

fact has the relevant information that I need.

16

to use third party subpoena power.

17
18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?
I would assume the

aggregator would have the relevant information.
MR. PHILLIPS:

23

it might not.

24

get the information.

25

I would assume the

aggregators have the relevant information.

19

21

I have

In some instances it might or

The problem is the aggregator has got to

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But they have to -- they

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have the burden of proof in the case and I assume they

2

have to investigate the facts and be prepared for

3

trial.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

And that would help on the

5

affirmative case that they have to put together, but it

6

doesn't help with respect to the counterclaims.

7

Qwest amicus brief does a very nice job of explaining

8

that there are a lot of situations where the -- where

9

the payphone operators are overpaid and it's very

The

10

difficult -- first of all, and the aggregator has no

11

idea or any incentive to find out any of that, any of

12

that information.

13

the aggregator saying, provide me with the information,

14

the brief quotes in a variety of places comments such

15

as, you know, "whatever the -- our aggregator says is

16

fine with us," or "I don't care about those claims," or

17

answers like that, which, if I sue you -- I mean, if you

18

sue me and I ask for those, you cannot give me back

19

those answers.

20

And when Qwest made the requests of

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you can make that same

21

answer if it's just a standard assignee for collection

22

of -- of a debt for single person.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but if it's a simple

24

assignee for a debt and nothing more than that, just a

25

power of attorney -- or are you talking about a full
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

assignment?

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

It's a full

3

assignment, where everybody agrees that there's

4

standing.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

argument:

You can make the same

Oh, he might not have all the information.

8
9

But in no circumstance --

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but at least there he

is also responsible for both -- he has the entirety of

10

the right.

11

whatever counterclaims you have operate directly against

12

that particular individual.

13

He has the right and the remedy.

So that

But even in that context, Justice Kennedy,

14

it seems to me there's a fundamental difference, as a

15

matter of prudence, between dealing with a single

16

assignee back and forth and the disputes that arise

17

there and the difficulty of discovery that would exist

18

there, and the situation we have here where you have

19

1400 payphone operators --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have a discovery be

21

problem.

I don't see that it's a standing problem.

22

two things it reminds me of are, one very common, a

23

financer takes an interest in receivables and he's going

24

to have to collect them as receivables and there may be

25

50,000.

That could have the same kind of practical
13
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

problems.

2

or may not be aware of where somebody went around and

3

had assignments for 50,000 cabbages that were delivered

4

a day late in 50,000 box cars and each one was worth

5

about $10.

6

to pass a special statute.

7

Or we had cases in the First Circuit you may

Nobody figured a way out of that.

They had

There was -- and so it seems to me you're

8

better off than the cabbage people because have you two

9

possible remedies:

One on discovery; you could ask the

10

judge, Judge, see what the Communications Commission

11

thinks.

It's called primary jurisdiction of the kind.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

and you say, FCC, you got us into this.

15

But, Justice -Or you could go to the FCC

Now, you have some rules here that make some

16

sense in terms of collection.

17

agency avenues open to you, not open to the cabbage

18

people, and this doesn't seem a standing problem.

19

what's your response to that?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

You have both those

Now,

Well, there are two elements

21

of the standing problem:

The first one is we're all --

22

let's be clear -- we're talking about a hypothetical

23

that's different from this case because we're talking

24

about a hypothetical where in fact the assignee has a

25

concrete interest in the outcome of this dispute.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Here

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the assignee has no interest in the outcome of this

2

dispute.

3

So the Article III problem arises there.
The question is if you have a minor amount

4

at interest, even if it's, you know, concrete but

5

nevertheless approaches de minimis, should you

6

nevertheless entertain that case.

7

answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is that instead

8

of making this into a Federal court case, where you have

9

1400 claims like this, what the Court should say is that

And I think the

10

the better course to follow is in fact for the

11

plaintiffs to take their claims, if they want to, in an

12

aggregate form to the FCC because that's the right

13

institution to deal with it because it doesn't have the

14

limitations of Article III and it doesn't have the

15

limitations of prudential standing to interfere with its

16

ability to provide complete relief.

17

And, indeed, if you read the Respondents'

18

brief, they identify, as the prototype litigation, in

19

which this entire system worked effectively, a claim

20

that was in fact litigated in front of the Federal

21

Communications Commission, not a case that was litigated

22

in front of the Federal court.

23

right answer to this case is to take these cases all to

24

the FCC, not as a matter of what we do as primary

25

jurisdiction, but simply as what the plaintiffs do

So, to my mind, the

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because they don't have the vehicle to bring this to the

2

Federal courts.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -What do you do about --

5

about aggregated plaintiffs who are not in the field of

6

Federal regulation?

7

Can they petition for the creation of an FCC that they

8

can take their claims to?

9

there happens to be this Federal agency they could have

They're just sort of out of luck?

I mean, this is a fluke that

10

gone to.

11

not depend upon that fluke, should it?

12

Certainly our principles of standing should

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think when the Court

13

is considering the questions of prudence, you know, it

14

can certainly take it into account, and maybe that would

15

argue in the alternative in another case if there

16

weren't such an available vehicle that the Court might

17

be more inclined to entertain it under those

18

circumstances.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would there be review?

20

The FCC, you pointed out, doesn't have Article III

21

barriers.

22

party ends up losing.

23

So the FCC decides one way or another.

One

Is there review in Federal court?

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, Justice Ginsburg,

24

that is Spiller.

That's what the Court said in Spiller,

25

and I think it's a logical outgrowth of what the Court
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

held in ASARCO, which is that, even though a claim

2

doesn't start with Article III jurisdiction because it's

3

not an Article III entity, that when a final

4

determination comes out of that entity that is in fact

5

enforceable as a right that that right is enforceable

6

consistent with Article III notions.

7

That is what the Court essentially, without dealing with

8

Article III at all, said in Spiller, and that's clearly

9

what the Court held in ASARCO.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the advantage?

11

You have proposed the FCC route.

12

taken here.

13

court on claims like this?
MR. PHILLIPS:

From my perspective or from

the plaintiffs' perspective.

16
17

That obviously wasn't

What is the advantage of going to Federal

14
15

And that's true.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why would the plaintiff

make such a choice if the agency --

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because the -- the plaintiffs

19

here, the payphone operators, get a free pass in this

20

proceeding.

21

to go to Federal court and bring litigation with none of

22

the burdens of having to deal with discovery or

23

cross-claims or counterclaims or even necessarily being

24

bound by doctrines of res judicata and collateral

25

estoppel.

They get all of the benefits of being able

So you get all the benefits and none of the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disadvantages.

That's why it's an advantage for them to

2

go to Federal court.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

How is that different?
When -Just on that very point --

6

I need clarification on this.

7

than the case of the financer who takes accounts

8

receivable, which is very common?

9

accounts.

10

How is that different

You finance the

You take a secured interest in accounts

receivable.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And there you might

13

foreclose on the secured interests.

14

financer have to collect from everybody.

15

case different from that?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

Then you as the
How is your

Well, I don't know -In the respect you were

just talking about.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Well, I mean, the

20

real question is I don't know why that case is

21

necessarily in Federal court either.

22

that --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, a lot of

I know, but I mean, there

24

may be many reasons for that.

I'm just saying it's a

25

normal, practical problem, I believe, in the banking
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

community.

I don't know.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but most of that's

3

litigated in State courts, in which case there's no

4

serious problem --

5
6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Go back to my question, I'd

like to get an answer to it.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Certainly.
In respect to the problem

you were just mentioning, the discovery problem of

10

counterclaims or those problems, is this case any

11

different than the financing case I just mentioned?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

would arise in that context as well.

16

that's a situation that seems to me is largely driven by

17

the exigencies and by accident in Federal court.

18

is situation that is driven into Federal court by the

19

plaintiffs' choice and by the ability and the preference

20

to be in a position to get the benefits of litigation in

what is the benefit of being in the Federal court rather

than the FCC that makes this so attractive?

at the outset, that if there's a standard assignment for

collection you can be in the Federal court; there is

standing.

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

Right, there is Article III.
And Article III.

And let's not lose

sight of that core question -JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you're saying, if you're

19

saying that it's the aggregation that makes it difficult

20

to reach everybody, well, that's a question of

21

discovery, and it's still the aggregator's

22

responsibility.

23

necessary questions for discovery of the suit, the

24

suit's dismissed.

25

If the aggregator can't answer

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that may or may not

Alderson Reporting Company

have happen.

But let's be clear, okay.

The core

2

question here is whether or not an aggregator who has no

3

claim, who has no stake at all, not a penny's worth, can

4

pursue this litigation.

5

answer got -- should be no.

6

The concrete stake is a core requirement of Article III

7

and the Court ought to enforce it as a separation of

8

powers question.

On that it seems to me the
There's no benefit to it.

9

The issue that we've been discussing here is

10

what do you do when you get past that, and when you have

11

a kind of a bounty that's been attached to it, and how

12

do you resolve that?

13

this case, I still think that there would be grounds for

14

prudential standing to serve as a basis to eliminate

15

this kind of litigation.

In that situation, which is not

On the other hand, it may well

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you said --

I am sorry, Your Honor.
You said the aggregator

20

had -- that the aggregator could sue on behalf of these

21

1400 plaintiffs naming every one of them as a named

22

plaintiff in this complaint and still the aggregator

23

would run the show because they each authorized the

24

aggregator to conduct the litigation.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, it seems to me that

2

it's not very prudential to require that there be 1400

3

named plaintiffs instead of one.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, the price you

5

pay -- bless you -- is that when you bring Federal court

6

litigation -- is that you have to have -- you have to

7

expose yourself to exactly the burdens that come with

8

it.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You also pay a price.

I

10

thought that's what you were going to get at.

11

about prudential standing, 1400 filing fees is pretty

12

prudential.

13
14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Talking

Federal courts

clearly have an interest in that.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought your

16

position was they could all join in one complaint just

17

as long as they're all named separately.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

They can join in a single

19

complaint.

You know, the court can consider whether or

20

not it thinks joinder is appropriate under those

21

circumstances, but they could unquestionably do that.

22

But then, again, they are then at that point a plaintiff

23

in the litigation having brought this action and,

24

therefore, subject to all of the burdens of being a

25

plaintiff in the litigation, including submitting
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

themselves to the personal jurisdiction of the court.
I mean, let's be clear about this.

There

3

are 1400 names out of people all over the country that

4

under the -- under the plaintiffs aggregators' theory we

5

have to go chase down in order to obtain discovery, to

6

obtain any of our counterclaims or anything like that.

7

Whereas if they come into this Court and they submit

8

themselves to the jurisdiction, at least the process

9

works as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure --

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I don't like to be

11

the broken record.

12

why that isn't the responsibility of the plaintiff.

13

district court said, now, you've brought these claims.

14

The defendants need this information.

15

That's your responsibility.

16

I'm just not getting -- I don't see

MR. PHILLIPS:

The

You go get that.

Well, I don't doubt that the

17

trial court can do that, but the question is:

Why do we

18

have to go to the burden of having to chase all of that

19

in the first instance?

20

I mean, the Respondent's brief at page 10

21

criticizes us for not having brought 1400 third-party

22

complaints, not having sought additional discovery.

23

of those are burdens that simply arise in this context

24

that otherwise do not exist in an ordinary case where

25

you simply ask the party who has the actual claim to be
24
Alderson Reporting Company

All

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the plaintiff in front of the court.

2

And that's -- and, again, just to be clear,

3

we are still here dealing with the hypothetical.

4

not dealing with the core question of what do you do

5

with a plaintiff who has not one penny at stake in

6

litigation that, as the lawyers describe, is all hard

7

cash.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm sorry.

We're

The only way,

it seems to me, that you can eliminate what you regard

10

as a problem is by having 1400 separate actions, so that

11

in any given case if you want discovery, your plaintiff,

12

the person who has got to provide that discovery, is

13

standing right there.

14

And I don't see how you can get the benefits

15

that you are claiming entitled to without having 1400

16

separate actions.

17

actions, whether you have an aggregation like this,

18

whether you have a joint action, whether you have a

19

class action, this problem of chasing down, as you

20

describe it, is going to be there.

21

If you don't have 1400 separate

So it seems to me the prudential question

22

for this Court is:

Do we really want to require 1400

23

separate actions so that you can have your perfect

24

paradigm of private litigation?

25

want 1400 actions, it seems to me is a stretch.

And to say, yes, we

25
Alderson Reporting Company

What do

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

you say?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the answer to that is

3

that when you -- when you deal with mass tort

4

litigation, the Rules of Civil Procedure ought to apply

5

in that context as it applies in every other place.

6

when the courts deviate from the standard paradigm for

7

litigation, they do it expressly, either through the

8

rules or through doctrines that already exist.

9

And

And so we have Rule 23, which sets out very

10

clear protections for both the courts -- or not only for

11

the courts, but for the plaintiffs and for the absent

12

defendants -- absent, absent plaintiffs and for the

13

defendants, and is a clear mechanism for conducting 1400

14

claims all once in a particular situation.

15
16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What does that have to do

with -- I guess that goes to prudential standing.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19
20

It goes directly -It has nothing to do with

Article III standing.
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, to be sure.

Again, I

21

don't think that -- I mean, the Article III debate here

22

seems to me to turn solely on the question of there is

23

no stake in the outcome of this case.

24

requirement of Article III and ought to be a basis for

25

simply reversing.

That's a bedrock

But, you know, to the extent that the
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court then goes beyond that and worries about what's the

2

next case going to look like and what are the prudential

3

limitations, which I don't think the Court has to

4

resolve any of this, what I would suggest is the Court

5

should be informed by Rule 23 and associational standing

6

and those doctrines --

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Are you saying, in effect,

8

that if we get to the prudential-standing point, the

9

answer is that in the absence of a rule comparable to

10

Rule 23 we should not recognize prudential standing, but

11

that if we adopted a rule that sort of regulated how

12

this would work, prudential standing would be

13

appropriate?

14

Is that basically it?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I think that's the right

15

answer, is that the Court shouldn't just make it up as

16

it goes along.

17

and the truth is we've been here 200 years.

18

had to have aggregator standing all of this time.

19

strikes me that there's no compelling need for a change

20

and that for that reason the Court ought to go back to

21

the paradigm example, plaintiffs sue defendants and you

22

have normal discovery and counterclaims.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if there is a need for this -- look,
We haven't
It

Is there any significance

24

to this being the -- this assignment transfers legal

25

title.

True, there's an obligation to pay, to pay the
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

separate PSPs.

2

For example, suppose the -- I gather the check would be

3

payable to the aggregator if the aggregator prevails.

4

Could a creditor of the aggregator come in and say,

5

stop, you owe me lots of money and I want to reach those

6

proceeds?

7

But does anything turn on legal title?

MR. PHILLIPS:

That -- I mean the proceeds

8

-- I assume -- do those claims arise out of the

9

relationship between the payphone operators and the

10

aggregator?

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. PHILLIPS:

that?

It's completely unrelated to

These are just the

Or the aggregator goes bankrupt.
MR. PHILLIPS:

I assume those moneys could

be taken out of the aggregator and then the PSP would

have a claim over against the aggregator for breach of

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But also not one in which

MR. ENGLERT:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Englert, with respect

to what weight we should give to those decisions, I just

want to put a simple hypo and I'll ask a question on it.

identical is identical to this one, except that the

10

terms of the second agreement, i.e., if I the aggregator

11

collect anything I give it to you.

12

of the first agreement, so that there is an assignment

13

and as part of the assigning document there is a stated

14

obligation on the part of the assignee to pay all

15

proceeds to the assignor.

16
17

Assume that is part

I am assuming that your position would be
the same; is that correct?

18

MR. ENGLERT:

Absolutely.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, my question is, you're

20

taking that position, I think, just as you did in

21

response to Justice Scalia, on the grounds that there is

22

a huge body of law that assignment for collection

23

conveys adequate standing.

But are any of the

Alderson Reporting Company

2

payment of any benefit back to the assignor?

3

MR. ENGLERT:

Justice Souter, the cases

4

don't always discuss the way in which the assignment

5

arose.

6

there are these two promises, and they say the fact that

7

there is a second promise makes no difference.

9

whether in the same document or in a different document,

10
11
12

But typically, in those cases they simply say,

That's

The fact that there's a second promise,

makes no difference.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's the earliest of

those cases in our Court?

MR. ENGLERT:

The earliest case --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The earliest case in our

15

Court that upholds this that, without specifically

16

addressing the standing issue, gives judgment?

if you want a case specifically about assigning

Because for the exact reason

Mr. Phillips gave you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

point, but it happens to be true.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I thought our

cases made clear that that kind of -- -- I forget what

13

we call it -- it's a separate interest from the injury

14

that you're alleging in the lawsuit.

15

in the lawsuit that the basis for Article III injury is

16

that you're in this line of work and if the work dries

17

up you're in big trouble.

18

support Article III standing.

19

MR. ENGLERT:

You don't allege

That wouldn't be enough to

No.

What's enough to support

20

Article III standing is the interest of the assignors,

21

as the Court held in Vermont Agency.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but then why

23

is the assignee bringing the lawsuit?

24

MR. ENGLERT:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The assignee --

He had no

2

MR. ENGLERT:

The assignee is bringing the

3

lawsuit for the most pragmatic of all possible reasons.

4

Mr. Phillips wanted to talk a lot about discovery, and

Justice Kennedy and I believe Justice Souter asked why

6

is this lawsuit in Federal court instead of before the

7

FCC.

There are good answers to those questions.

redressed by --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
36
Alderson Reporting Company

No.

But you know,

Official - Subject to Final Review

Vermont Agency, obviously, the assignee recovers

2

something himself, that he gets to keep the bounty.

3

Here that's not the case.

4

MR. ENGLERT:

Here that's not the case, but

5

the reasoning of Vermont Agency specifically rejected

6

the proposition that the bounty was helpful to the

7

assignee's standing.

8

Agency that says when you combine the bounty with the

9

assignor's interest that's enough.

And there is not a word in Vermont

It just says the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought it said -- I

13

thought it said, Mr. Englert, that, that the United

14

States has -- is treated as having assigned part of its

15

claim for damages to the qui tam relator, and that gave

16

the qui tam plaintiff a stake in the action, a stake in

17

the proceeds.

18

Justice Scalia will correct me if I'm wrong -- was

19

envisioning the kind of assignment that Judge Sentelle

20

was talking about when he said there are assignments and

21

then there are assignments.

case conveys all right, title and interest.

2

it for purposes of collection to be sure, but it conveys

3

all right, title and interest.

4

It conveys

Now, the proposition that the "for purposes

5

of collection" purpose of an assignment negates the

6

ability of the plaintiffs to sue is one that has been

7

litigated many times in Federal courts, and that

8

argument has been rejected in every case in which it's

9

come up until now, including two from this Court.

So

10

between the fact that the reasoning of Vermont Agency,

11

whatever the facts were, relied on the interest of the

12

assignor, relied on the ancient doctrine that the

13

assignee for Article III purposes stands in the

14

assignor's shoes, and the fact that this argument has

15

been rejected in every case in which it's come up, I

16

think the case for Article III standing is quite strong

17

here.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I must say we seem to have

19

come full circle from Flash v. Cohen, which said that

20

the doctrine of standing had nothing whatever to do with

for is to assure that concrete adverseness on which our

of Article III standing is that both parties have a

that there are many procedural devices available to deal

19

in this case, first of all as a factual matter, AT&T and

21

they would have done something in nine years to try to

22

bring a claim against PSP, and they have done nothing in

24

to be worrying about whether they have lost some

25

counterclaim rights because the PSPs -- lost some

If there were serious counterclaims

So this is a very, very odd case in which

44
Alderson Reporting Company

counterclaim rights because the PSPs aren't individual

2

parties.

3

It's also a very odd case in which to be

4

worrying about discovery rights because the PSPs aren't

5

individual parties because that issue was resolved in

6

their favor in 2000 by the special master's discovery

7

order saying, just as Justice Stevens postulated, the

8

aggregator to go out and get the information from the

9

PSPs.

10

Now they complained that some of the PSPs,

11

some of these mom and pop operations, said we don't have

12

any information.

13

PSP don't have any information.

14

with the carriers and with the aggregators.

15

purely practical, pragmatic matter this is not the case

16

in which to be worrying that some discovery rights have

17

been lost; this is not the case in which to be worrying

in which some counterclaim rights have been lost; this

19

is not the case in which to be worrying that my clients

right in some claim like that, is there a way to get

think it was the purpose of this statute to have 12 cent

claims, even aggravated, brought back years later under

would it make a difference if the assignee did not have

4

MR. ENGLERT:

Oh, it would make a huge

difference, Justice Ginsburg.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- but is that just a

formality?

For example, the question I asked

Mr. Phillips.

this money when the check is paid by AT&T and Sprint and

Could a creditor of the aggregator get at

10

therefore reduce the amount available to distribute to

11

the PSPCs?

12

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, if we assume insolvency

13

and we assume a secured creditor, then, yes, I think the

14

PSPs are general unsecured creditors, and the secured

15

creditor is in line ahead of them.

17

if the assignee enters insolvency, which is not going to

18

happen in this case, but if the assignee enters

19

insolvency and if there is a creditor that arguably

20

under insolvency principles has a higher claim than the

21

PSPs, yes, it does make a difference to the assignee.

24

income?

25

But, yes, it does make a difference

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

to that.

6

I'm guessing

But I really don't know the exact answer

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Englert, can you

7

explain to me again how it is that when you acquire 14

8

separate choses in action, 14 separate claims, against

9

the same defendant, just by your acquiring them they

10

sort of melt into one cause of action.

11

how does that happen?

12

MR. ENGLERT:

How does that --

That happens the same way it

13

happens under Rule 23.

14

happens with the trustee who is representing people who

15

would otherwise have many different causes of action.

16

It's a very common thing in Federal court.

17

a bankruptcy trustee or if a class representative brings

18

a lawsuit on behalf of many people, then there is one

19

cause of action instead of the many causes of action

20

there would be if those many people sued directly.

21

not an issue.

22

It happens the same way it

They are embodied in the very agreements

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But why do we have Rule 23

16

that requires certification of a class action?

17

can say, well, I don't need Rule 23, I'm going to take

18

1400 claims and make them one any way.

19

MR. ENGLERT:

For very good reasons.

If you

Rule

20

23 exists to protect absent plaintiffs, something we

21

don't have here, and to protect defendants so that they

22

will know there will be a res judicata effect of the

23

judgment, whether for them or against them, so that they

24

can't be sued by other class members.

25

They have those protections.
57
Alderson Reporting Company

In fact, if

Official - Subject to Final Review

you read the blue and yellow briefs in this case, they

2

keep referring in the abstract to the protections of

3

Rule 23, but they don't identify a single concrete

protection that they do not have under this system.

5

Rule 23 is inferior to an action by assignees for

means we should throw out a traditional form of action

The specific protection is that the courts

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is a matter that should be litigated in this forum

2

because it is a more efficient mechanism for litigating

it, not because the assignor -- assignee decided that

4

this is more efficient way from the assignee's

5

perspective --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. PHILLIPS:

And are problems --

-- to litigate the issue.
Are the requirements of

typicality and -- the same type of injury designed in

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, of course, because you

12

don't want to have all this litigation being heaped on a

13

particular defendant under these circumstances.

is an efficiency to this process that the rules

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.

7

We would oppose it.

I don't think that this is a proper

case for class certification.

9

that doesn't mean okay, and, therefore, the answer to

But it seems to me that

10

this is:

Come up with some other contrivance in order

11

to litigate this in a way that obviously maximizes the

12

convenience to one side without regard to the

13

protections that are designed both for the defendant and

14

for the court that's embodied in Rule 23.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Phillips, do you

16

attach any significance to the fact that every member of

17

the so-called class here has individually agreed to be

18

bound by the judgment?

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it's interesting

20

because they -- in one -- in the assignment part of it

21

they say they are bound, but on the -- on the separate

22

set of the agreement it talks about the reasonable

23

discretion of the assignor -- assignee.

24

agreement is, to my mind, inherently contradictory as to

25

what are the obligations.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Which -- the assignees,

but the assignors have agreed to be bound --

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if it's reasonable --

4

it says reasonable discretion.

And so the question is,

5

you know, is this -- was that an exercise of reasonable

6

discretion?

7

And I don't know the answer to that in any

And I think part of the -- Justice Kennedy

9

and Justice Breyer, you asked the question about above

10

and beyond discovery, what are the other problems that

11

arise when you go down this -- and the more -- the other

12

one is that being bound by the judgment.

13

If you have a complete assignment of the

14

chosen action, the assignee, then, is completely bound.

15

There is nothing left.

16

There is nothing left for the assignor to do in that

17

situation; whereas, in these kinds of situations where

18

the assignee receives the right to go forward but the

19

remedy is in another party's hands, the potential for

20

being bound is completely lost.

21
22
23
24

The assignor has no rights left.
