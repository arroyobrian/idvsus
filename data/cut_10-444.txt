23

And the court of appeals

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, sometimes one's

24

experience has to be challenged.

I, for one, have never

25

heard of a case in which parties are discussing a plea,

1

except in the most unusual of circumstances, and they

2

advance a court date to enter the plea.

3

they just wait till the court date and tell the judge:

4

I'm ready to plead guilty.

5

In most cases,

This is such an unusual case, because the

6

plea happens on day one.

7

that between day one and day five, or three or four, the

8

guy would have come in and pled guilty, would have

9

advanced the later court date?
MR. KOSTER:

10

The court below is assuming

Well, the plea -- the plea

11

December 28th, 2007, I believe, and -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

22

the 29th or 30th?

23
24
25

MR. KOSTER:

That actually was a fifth

offense, but yes.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

My point is,

Official

1

how reasonable could it be for the -- for a court to

2

assume that the plea offer had been made and that he

3

would have taken it before the January court date that

4

was set?

5

MR. KOSTER:

It would be less than likely,

6

but not impossible, I would say.

And it would depend on

7

a myriad of circumstances, many of which are as -- as --

8

could be just dependent on the defense counsel's own

9

personal schedule.
But the scheduling of a plea once -- once an

10
11

agreement has been made between a prosecutor and a

12

defense counsel, the scheduling of a plea I think is

13

largely a basis of convenience and does not

14

necessarily -- is not necessarily based on the

15

preliminary hearing date or any future scheduled date.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I suppose the

17

defendant might think, you know, there is really bad

18

evidence out there that they don't have yet.

19

I -- I want to nail this deal down as soon as possible.

20

I mean, that would be a reason to -- to move things up

21

and get the plea in early, wouldn't it?

22
23
24
25

MR. KOSTER:

It could be.

And if

I would say that

that is -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
how often that happens.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, I don't know

Official

1

MR. KOSTER:

That's possible.

I don't --

2

right.

But it's also exactly another reason to keep the

3

discretion of offering these plea bargains and the

4

ability to take these plea bargains back solely in the

5

hands of the prosecutors of the country.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm really puzzled by what

7

as a practical matter is at stake in this case.

Under

8

the State court decision, the defendant has the option

9

of either pleading guilty to the charge, in which case

10

he will be right back where he is now, or he can insist

11

on a trial.

12

And if he insists on a trial, you need to

13

prove that he was driving with a revoked license.

14

seems to me -- if there ever was a slam-dunk trial, that

15

seems to me that's the slam-dunk trial.

16

the records of -- showing that his license was revoked,

17

and you have the officer testify on such and such a date

18

he was driving.

19

in this case.

21

You introduce

So, I don't really see what is involved

But in this case also, the defendant went out 2 days

finding, or some lower court judge made a finding that

25

if he had known about the better deal that was offered,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

he would have taken it?

2

MR. KOSTER:

That -- what is in the record

3

is that he would have taken the 90-day deal on the

4

misdemeanor.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. KOSTER:

Yes.

But there is also an important

7

element in the record, that when he went in front of the

8

court on March 3rd and the felony offer was given to the

9

judge, which was 3 years and defer on probation plus 10

10

days' shock time, the judge in Columbia, Missouri, gave

11

the felony offer the back of his hand.

12

And so, while, yes, the record says that --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then that's a causal

14

problem.

You're saying that, even if he had accepted

15

it, it would have gone to the judge, and the judge would

16

have turned it down anyway.

17

accepted it.

18

MR. KOSTER:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. KOSTER:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

The judge wouldn't have

If the judge -Is that your point?

Well, then there's a --

somebody must have found somewhere that this made a

difference.

24

MR. KOSTER:

That --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That the failure to tell

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

him about the special offer of the misdemeanor did in

2

fact make a difference because he would have accepted it

3

and he would have ended up with it.

4

MR. KOSTER:

Well, and that is the problem

5

that brings us here today.

6

Appeals said that --

The Missouri Court of

-- through a -- a


misinterpretation, we believe, of the Strickland


10

standard and, more importantly, a misreading of where

11

Hill and Premo takes us.

12

just at the same time that Premo was very clearly

13

re-articulating the Hill standard.

14

Cert was granted on this case

And so, the court of appeals had gone back

15

towards Strickland with a very broad reading just as

16

this Court was coming down with an opinion that very

17

clearly re-articulated the Hill standard, the two-part

18

performance and prejudice test.

19

And that's what we are asking be reversed.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose he had snapped up

21

this deal as soon as it was offered.

22

appeared before the court to answer a formal plea of

23

guilty, would the court have known that he had in the

24

interim been arrested yet again for driving without a

25

license?
9

Alderson Reporting Company

By the time he

MR. KOSTER:

The court probably would have

2

known as a result of a pre-sentence investigation.

3

perhaps more importantly, Your Honor, the prosecutor

4

himself would have known about the -- the second arrest,

5

and he would have withdrawn it.

6

And

And if I may, it's not always -- we've

7

concentrated so far in the case before and today on

8

subsequent criminal actions.

9

Missouri, the criminal reporting system, we still use on

12

possible that the prosecutor learns at a subsequent date

13

of a criminal history that is -- that is material that

14

predates the plea offer.

15

it's important that prosecutors have full discretion to

16

take these pleas back.

17

It is also

And so, in both directions,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, regardless, your

18

legal position is that there is no basis for setting

19

aside the plea if an earlier, better offer was not

20

communicated.

21

That's your legal position, right?

22

MR. KOSTER:

My legal position is that a

23

finding -- a conviction was entered on March 3rd.

He

24

pled guilty.

25

satisfies a standard by which we are going to unwind it?

The question before the Court is, what

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

A Sixth Amendment violation would satisfy that standard,

2

and if -- if there was a Sixth Amendment violation, if

3

the plea was truly involuntary, we would unwind it.

4

But the search for a better deal that is

5

antecedent to the events of March 3rd is not the Sixth

6

Amendment violation that should begin unwinding --

7
8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
there's --

9
10

You say -- you say

MR. KOSTER:

-- 97 percent of the

convictions in the country.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- no Sixth Amendment

12

violation when the counsel fails to communicate a

13

favorable offer to the defendant.

14

MR. KOSTER:

No.

That's your position.

Respectfully, Your Honor,

15

that is not my position.

16

ineffective assistance is a two-part test, that there

17

was a performance breach in the failure to communicate,

18

but once the performance breach is accepted, then it has

19

to be run through the Hill standard to find whether

20

prejudice has occurred, and then we would find a Sixth

21

Amendment breach.

22

logically because the offer did not exist after -- after

23

December 28.

24
25

My position is that

But we -- we do not get there

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I -- I didn't

understand that to be your position.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

1

There -- there is a statement in your brief

that the question is whether plea negotiations that did

not result in a guilty plea constitute a critical

confrontation that gives the rise to effective

5

assistance of counsel during such negotiations.

6

thought your position was that so long as the plea

MR. KOSTER:

20

I believe they are not -- I

21

believe that -- that plea negotiations are not a

22

critical stage under the laws of this Court.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's what we took the

24

case for.

We didn't -- we wouldn't have taken the case

25

if we were concerned about what happened in March and
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what happened in February.

2

your position, that this is not a Sixth Amendment

3

violation in these circumstances.

4

MR. KOSTER:

We took the case because of

I do not -- there is a factual

5

question as to whether or not plea negotiations in this

6

case really ever engaged when all that ever occurred was

7

the prosecutor sent a letter to the defense attorney.

8

Only in the most technical of readings --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but we don't care

10

about that.

11

mean, we don't take cases to figure out those -- those,

12

you know, picky, picky factual questions.

13

that I thought was important here is whether this is a

14

critical stage when -- when the defendant is not -- does

15

not accept the -- the plea and plead guilty.

16

You know, what do we care about that?

MR. KOSTER:

I

The issue

Plea negotiations I don't

17

believe are a critical stage, because the fate -- in the

18

back and forth between a prosecutor and a defense

19

attorney, the fate of the accused is not -- is not set.

20

And these -- of course, these negotiations can take

21

place over a very long time.

22

from the table and walk away at any time.

23

perhaps most importantly, the -- the dialogue of the

24

negotiations are not used against the defendant at

25

critical stages, which would contrast it, I suppose,

Either party can get up

13

Alderson Reporting Company

And then,

Official

1

with a Miranda situation in a custodial interrogation

2

where that would be a critical stage.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if it were a critical

4

stage, I suppose that counsel would be ineffective, not

5

only if he was a lousy lawyer and didn't know the law,

6

but if he was a bad negotiator.

7

a good criminal lawyer means you -- you got to be a good

8

horse trader, right?

9
10

MR. KOSTER:

I agree that that would be one

Yes.

You tell him to turn

-- was applied to plea

negotiations.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

-- that in fact, you know,

16

was a pretty good deal, that would be ineffective

17

assistance of counsel.

18

how to handle yourself in the used car lot, right?

19

MR. KOSTER:

So, you must -- you must know

I understand that that would be

one of the ramifications --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

Being

of the extensions, if critical stage analysis --

11
12

I mean -- right?

So, Mr. Koster -This is on the basic

question -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's -- it's very odd for

you to say that -- to me -- that this is not a critical
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

stage.

If it results in a guilty plea and the -- and

2

the attorney has not done sufficient research to uncover

3

a defense, it can be set aside then.

4

you're saying it's not a critical stage depending on

5

what the end result is.

So, it's -- so,

That's very difficult.

6

I thought we were going to tell attorneys,

7

you have an obligation during the plea bargain process

8

to use professional competence.

9

do or you don't.

10

And you say, well, you

That doesn't make much sense.

MR. KOSTER:

My understanding, Your Honor,

11

is that attorneys are guaranteed to the accused at

12

critical stages, such as arraignments, plea hearings,

13

trials, but then there is an implied guarantee that

14

comes with that critical stage, and that implied

15

guarantee is that their -- that the attorney appointed

16

will do research, analysis, and preparation that

17

prepares him for the critical stage.

18

But when David Boyce is sitting home on a

19

Saturday night with a file open in his lap preparing for

20

a case on Monday, that moment is not a critical stage of

21

trial, on a Saturday night in his den, but it prepares

22

for, it is precedent to, a critical stage.

23

failure to engage in that preparation analysis can lead

24

to performance and prejudice at critical stages, but it

25

itself is not.

question -- I make a counter-assumption.

that I -- I have the feeling that I'd like you and the

4

others to comment on, is that you're worried deeply

5

about a practical problem, and that the practical

6

problem is that it would be too easy, as just was

suggested by the question, to find that the lawyer,

21

certainty, work out a standard, that there really was

22

inadequate assistance during the plea bargaining, and

you have to show something more than a reasonable

probability that this would have led to the plea, et

stage, but that prejudice does not occur until we return

12

to a critical stage, which is -- is when that -- when

13

that plea, when the product of that plea negotiation is

need to show that that prejudiced you because, absent --

the plea, correct?

4
5

MR. YANG:

It can, and because what's

relevant --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right, so -- and

7

that's because counsel pre the entry of the plea did not

adequately advise his client.

9

MR. YANG:

Right, right.

The key is that --

Why -- why is there no

11

problem when he doesn't adequately advise a client of

MR. YANG:

It's a different prejudice.

The

14

-- when you plead guilty and your counsel has advised

15

you wrongly in a way that would have changed your mind

16

about the merits of going forward on trial, you can show

17

that the waiver of the trial right is something that was

18

prejudiced.

19

properly advised, you would have exercised the whole

20

panoply of rights that the Constitution provides one who

21

goes to trial, not only a right to a trial by jury but

22

all the trial rights that go with it.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Yang, there are

5

different kinds of unfairness.

One kind of unfairness

6

is when you're badly advised and you, therefore, waive

7

your right to trial when you would have gone.

8

there's another kind of prejudice, which is, you know,

9

you and 10 other guys are all in the same situation, and

But

10

those 10 other guys come up with a favorable plea deal

up with an unfavorable plea deal because your lawyer has

15

unfairness needs to be addressed by it, doesn't it?

MR. YANG:

Well, when -- again, once --

whether or not there was a prior error, once you plead

deals on the table; the question is whether that waiver

Well, I guess that's the

Why isn't that the question?
MR. YANG:

Well, right, but if it were the

question, it would call into -- this Court, in -- in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what's -- the relevant question when you enter a guilty

2

plea is whether you have waived your rights to trial

3

validly.

And, in fact, that has to be spread upon the

4

record.

Rule 11(b) has now been modified by this Court

5

to go through the things you have to check to make sure

6

that that waiver of your trial rights are knowing and

7

voluntary.

8
9

What we have here is not anything associated
with the waiver of trial rights.

What really the

10

defendant is claiming is some entitlement be able to

11

take another deal that would not have resulted in trial.

12

But that is not relevant to the waiver of trial rights.

13

That would be recognizing another type of right.

14

this Court has repeatedly held that there is no right to

15

a guilty plea, there is no right to plea bargaining;

16

once you have a plea agreement, there is no right to

17

enforcement.

18

when that guilty plea is rendered into a judgment.

19

when you don't get there, but instead you plead guilty

20

and you have waived your rights to trial, you have

21

consented to the entry of judgment, and even if you had

22

received better advice you would have consented to

conceded inadequacy?

If he doesn't want

to go to trial and he's going to plead guilty, is there

2

any circumstance where he could regain that lost

opportunity?

4

MR. YANG:

If he has -- if he has pleaded

5

guilty and he validly waived his rights to trial because

6

he would not have asserted them, then I think under Hill

7

what you have is a defendant who admits guilt, there's

8

no real risk of any kind of error in that determination,

9

and the judgment which must be set aside -- remember, we

10

have to set aside the judgment.

The judgment rests on

11

the admission of guilt and the waiver of trial.

12

judgment cannot be set aside at that point, because this

13

Court has long recognized the -- the special force of

14

finality with respect to guilty pleas.

15

-- for several reasons.

The

That's because

16

First, guilty pleas are an important part of

17

the system, and it would be -- both delay and impair the

18

orderly administration of justice any time we open

19

another avenue to challenge guilty pleas.

20

once the defendant has stood up in open court and

21

admitted guilt, there is almost no risk of error, and

the defendant has gotten the proper sentence and the

proper conviction.

is subject to the contention that, oh, there was an

here, to Justice Breyer's earlier question that I think

these convictions in search of lost plea opportunities?

5

I think that we should not.

6

the -- there were long discussions in both Hill and

7

Premo about the importance of the finality of these and

8

our being able to rely on the finality of these

9

decisions.

There's mutual reliance.

It undermines

There's State

10

reliance as well because, when these offers are made,

11

the State does not interview witnesses, the State does

12

not send evidence to the lab, the State does not, you

13

know -- sometimes even get to the point where the

14

charges are made.

15

which is synonymous with a reliance of justice on the

finality of these agreements as well.

17

So, there's State reliance and --

And also, the search for these lost

opportunities that Mr. Frye is asking this Court to lead
