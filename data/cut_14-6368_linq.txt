 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WENDY M. WARD

11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MS. WARD: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The core of the liberty interest protected 

12

by due process is the right to be free from unjustified 

13

bodily restraint and harm.  It's hard to imagine 

14

anything more inconsistent with these core rights than 

15

the use of a weapon on a restrained detainee, and that 

16

is why Respondents urge this Court to import a 

17

subjective intent element that doesn't relate to due 

18

process, but is instead drawn from the test for 

19

violation of a convicted prisoner's Eighth Amendment 

20

rights. 

21

 Respondents candidly admit that they favor 

22

this test because it better insulates guards from 

23

liability, but that is no reason to ignore meaningful 

24

constitutional distinctions between those who have been 

25

convicted and those who have not.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, why isn't the 

2

safety of the detainee, why isn't that just a facet of 

3

the use of excessive force?  I think that's how the 

4

district court treated it. 

5

 MS. WARD: 

The  the safety of the detainee 

6

was the stated objective for the use of the force in 

7

in this case.  And that is a legitimate interest, but 

8

the determination of whether the  the force itself was 

9

excessive is based on the Bell test for legitimate 

10

purpose, legitimate penological objectives.  So then the 

11

test is objectively, then, whether or not the use of 

12

force was excessive to the state  stated need and the 

13

Fourth Amendment test provides a  a  a good familiar 

14

workable standard that can be used to determine that 

15

question. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You  you mentioned the 

17

Fourth Amendment now, but as I understand it, the 

18

complaint just alleged a due process violation.  It 

19

didn't  it didn't refer to the Fourth Amendment. 

20

 MS. WARD: 

That's correct, Your Honor.  And 

21

 and the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process 

22

test as articulated in Bell does provide the clearest 

23

application by the Court of the rights of detainees in 

24

the prison context. 

25

 And the Court has stated that Bell does

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

apply to the excessive force claims of pretrial 

2

detainees and it makes perfect sense because, like a 

3

prison policy that goes too far, it's easy to see how 

4

a use of force can be administered as punishment. 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So suppose you have a 

6

detainee being held in a prison population.  And 

7

is  is your point that the prisoners can be punished, 

8

but the detainee cannot be? 

9
10

 MS. WARD: 

That's correct, under the 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

All right.  Now  now 

11

now suppose the prisoners are misbehaving.  They're 

12

unruly.  They're yelling and throwing things at the 

13

guards and the guards say, alright, lockdown for 24 

14

hours; you can't go to the mess hall.  Now, the detainee 

15

raises his hand and says, Oh, excuse me.  I'm a 

16

detainee.  I  I have a different standing. 

17
18
19

 Is that your  is that what has to happen 
here. 
 MS. WARD: 

Yes, but ­ but the problem with 

20

the hypothetical is that the  that's a legitimate 

21

penological objective.  So under either test, neither 

22

the prisoner 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That was my next question. 

24

So there can be punishment for simply not  in order to 

25

maintain discipline within the prison population.  You

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

can be deprived of your exercise or your right to go to 

2

the mess halls.  So you can, quote, "punish" for that 

3

purpose, even if it's a pretrial detainee. 

4

 MS. WARD: 

If it's a pretrial detainee, 

5

you  you can discipline for  to enforce legitimate 

6

objectives.  If it's a convicted prisoner, even harsh 

7

conditions are 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You use the word 

"discipline;" I use the word "punish."  Are they the 
same? 
 MS. WARD: 

They're not the same.  Punishment 

12

is the end result of application of the Bell test. 

13

Discipline is what happens to you if you fail to follow 

14

the rules. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And it doesn't matter if 

16

the  if the punisher, so to speak, is simply an 

17

individual guard at the prison versus the  the State, 

18

which will run a prison that it knows has these cruel 

19

guards.  It doesn't matter.  The  the tortification of 

20

the Due Process Clause, right? 

21

 MS. WARD: 

Right.  It  it doesn't matter. 

22

And, in fact, guards are probably entitled to even less 

23

deference than prison administrators who are making 

24

policy for the Court.  In footnote 38 of Bell, the Court 

25

acknowledged  that  or suggested that individual

instances of abusive practices might be  the guards 

2

might be given 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's a substantive due 

4

5

process.

 MS. WARD:

Amendment.  You're not relying on the Eighth Amendment? 
 MS. WARD: 

That's right, other than to 

distinguish 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MS. WARD: 

13
14

And it's not the Eighth 

Right. 
 what you can do with a 

convicted prisoner versus a detainee. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I just have to tell you, I 

15

find it very difficult to understand how it would be a 

16

different standard if these same facts occurred, but it 

17

was an inmate who was serving a sentence.  What  what 

18

is the rationale for why they should be different? 

19

 MS. WARD: 

The rationale for why they should 

20

be different is it's a  it's an afterthefact 

21

analysis.  And the Constitution requires that detainees 

22

not be punished.  And it allows 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  Why is

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  but you said that

they could be disciplined and now  and that's 
 MS. WARD: 

I think the  I think the 

difference 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You use the  I  where 

5

am I going to read to find a difference between 

6

discipline and punishment? 

7

 MS. WARD: 

I think the difference is 

8

punishment is the result of applying the Bell 

9

rationallyrelated test.  If use of force is not 

10

rationally related to a legitimate objective, we can 

11

define that as punishment.  If the act complained of 

12

fails the Bell test, objectively, we can call that 

13

punishment. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But even 
I'm having a problem 

16

with trying to understand why we're talking about a 

17

difference between any of the Amendments, the Fourth, 

18

the Fourteenth, or the Eighth.  The cruel and unusual 

19

punishment, I thought, was generally  generally 

20

applicable to the sentence a prisoner receives. 

21

 That's very different than to the 

22

application of  of force separate from the  from the 

23

sentence.  We're talking about whether and under what 

24

circumstances a prison guard or a prison is liable for 

25

using unnecessary force on another person.

 I don't think that taking any prisoner and 

2

for no reason  arbitrary reason banging his head on 

3

the wall because you think that'll send the message to 

4

other prisoners would be acceptable, do you, under any 

5

of the Amendments? 

6

 MS. WARD: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's correct. 
All right.  So I  I 

8

just don't quite understand the difference.  I think the 

9

issue is one, how  how you instruct the jury.  And the 

10

government is saying you instruct the jury by saying you 

11

have a subjective intent to punish the prisoner  you 

12

just want to beat him up; or you're inflicting harm 

13

that's not necessary or reasonable for a legitimate 

14

penological reason, correct?

That's correct.  That's correct.

is broader.

Do you have a different 

Well 
And explain why.  Why is 

the government standard not good enough? 
 MS. WARD: 

I misspoke.  I'm sorry.  I 

misspoke.  We agree with the government as to what the

Alderson Reporting Company

appropriate standard is, but we disagree with the 

2

government as to how the standard was improperly applied 

3

in the jury instructions in this case.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That I  I understand. 

I'm just talking about the standard now. 
 MS. WARD: 

We  we are in agreement with 

the Solicitor General on the standard. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What if  what if I don't 

agree with the Solicitor?  Is there anybody here to 

10

argue for a different standard?  No?  We  we just have 

11

to pick between two people who argue for the same 

12

standard, right? 

13

 MS. WARD: 

I  I  I believe the 

14

Respondents have a different standard in mind, Your 

15

Honor. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes.  Okay. 
Is it possible  I 

18

hadn't thought about it too much  that you would have 

19

different priorities in training, depending on whether 

20

you're dealing with people who've already been convicted 

21

of crimes and people who are being detained, like, 

22

perhaps people who have been convicted tend to engage in 

23

particular activity more than people just awaiting 

24

trial? 

25

 MS. WARD: 

I think the detainees can be as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

dangerous as prisoners.  But as to your point about 

2

training standards, currently, as the amici former 

3

corrections officers point out, they are trained to an 

4

objective standard.  And it's  it's difficult to even 

5

comprehend how you would train officers in view of 

6

particular subjective maliciousness element.  Do you 

7

do you explain to them how they can use force as long as 

8

they're not malicious, as long as they never admit to 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I know  of 

10

course you're not going to say you can't act with 

11

with malice, but it would seem to me if the standards 

12

are broader with respect to people who have been 

13

convicted, you might tell the officers, look, you have 

14

more flexibility with respect to people who are already 

15

subject to a conviction.  You have to be  you phrase 

16

it the other way  you have to be more careful with 

17

respect to people who are simply being detained. 

18

 But it's very complicated in a case like 

19

this because the Respondents make a very persuasive case 

20

that the convicts are actually less of a threat than 

21

the  often than the pretrial detainees.  You go to 

22

you're going to go to jail if you've got 10 days on a 

23

DUI or something like that, but the people who are 

24

detained preconviction may be multiple murderers. 

25

 MS. WARD: 

That's certainly true.  They

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

certainly may be dangerous folks who are deserving of 

2

you know, in the prison context, if they're dangerous 

3

and  and discipline needs to be imposed, that's 

4

that's a possibility.  The  the question is:  How do 

5

we evaluate their excessive force claims after the fact? 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I still go back to my 

7

question:  Why is there a difference at all?  What you 

8

seem to be suggesting is that gratuitous violence, 

9

unnecessary violence, can be directed to pretrial and 

10

posttrial detainees.  Isn't your objection that 

11

unreasonable, unnecessary force is not permissible?  Why 

12

are we giving a license to prison guards to use 

13

unreasonable or unnecessary force 

14

 MS. WARD: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

 MS. WARD: 

We are 
 against anybody? 

I think I understand your 

17

question, Justice Sotomayor.  Convicted prisoners 

18

actually can be punished.  That is one of the legitimate 

19

objectives with respect to convicted prisoners. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But they can't be 

21

punished corporally.  They can be denied good credit 

22

good time credit.  Do you think we could put them  you 

23

can knock them against the wall as punishment? 

24

 MS. WARD: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No. 
Not  not in terms of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

discipline.  It may be that some matter, immediate need 

2

justifies that action, but are you suggesting that as 

3

punishment they could do it for unnecessary force? 

4

Unnecessary, not punishment  or even punishment. 

5

They  they looked  they  they said the  a bad 

6

word to the prison officer. 

7
8
9

 MS. WARD: 

The egregious use force will fail 

both tests. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that's what I wanted 

10

to ask about.  As a practical matter, in evaluating 

11

excessive use of force claims, how much difference does 

12

it make whether there's a purely objective standard or a 

13

subjective standard.  It will be the rare case, I would 

14

imagine, where there's direct evidence of the officers' 

15

subjective intent.  So the subjective intent is going to 

16

be inferred from objective factors. 

17

 So what  give me an example of an excessive 

18

use of force claim that would involve the unreasonably 

19

a use of force that's objectively unreasonable, but there 

20

is not the subjective intent to harm. 

21

 MS. WARD: 

Mr. Kingsley's case might be just 

22

such an example.  It was unreasonable for him to be 

23

Tased, and under our jury instructions, the jury well 

24

could have found that that use of force was 

25

unreasonable.  But yet the subjective element that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

injected to our jury instructions could have made it 

2

it could have resulted in the  the finding for the 

3

the verdict for the Respondents. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, in a case where 

5

there's  where the jury thinks that there was force 

6

that was objectively unreasonable, and in particular, if 

7

it's a  if it's a 1983 claim or a Bivens claim, where 

8

the officer has qualified immunity, it doesn't seem to 

9

me that there are going to be very many cases where the 

10

difference between these two standards will result in a 

11

different outcome.  Am I wrong? 

12

 MS. WARD: 

I think you are wrong.  I think 

13

that juries give a lot of deference to officers.  And if 

14

they can  if they're allowed to inject their 

15

subjective good faith as part of a response to the 

16

elements for proving the  the case by the  by the 

17

prisoner, that would result in a lot more findings and 

18

verdicts in favor of guards, even in instances where 

19

objectively unreasonable, unjustified force is used. 

20
21

 In the ­ in the 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I don't see how you could 

22

use excessive force  unreasonably excessive force and 

23

be acting in good faith. 

24
25

 MS. WARD: 

Well, there's the issue  the 

issue of qualified immunity with respect to mistake of 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

law.  They could believe that the law actually allows

2

for them to engage in whatever use of force that 

3

they're  that they're using, but 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But no  but we're asking 

5

what the standard ought to be.  We don't talk about 

6

qualified immunity until we know and until the officer 

7

knows the standard. 

8

 MS. WARD: 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes. 
And as of this point, I ­ 

10

I do not know why the standard should be different for 

11

convicts as opposed to pretrial detainees, other than 

12

for purposes of rehabilitation.  And even that has to be 

13

reasonable.  You want to us say that under these facts, 

14

the result might be different, depending on if it's a 

15

pretrial detainee or an inmate, and that's just very 

16

difficult for me to understand why that should be. 

17

 MS. WARD: 

It's  it's  using the 

18

objective test for a pretrial detainee is faithful to 

19

the Constitution.  It's faithful to due process.  Due 

20

process talks about deprivations of life, liberty, or 

21

property.  Deprivations are X.  The Eighth Amendment, 

22

which governs the use of force with respect to convicted 

23

prisoners, talks about cruel and unusual punishment. 

24

There's a  there's a  an inherently subjective 

25

element to cruel and unusual punishment. 

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But  but Ms. Ward, you've

2

said a few times that we're supposed to be looking to 

3

see whether something counts as punishment.  And in the 

4

Eighth Amendment context, we've suggested that that term 

5

"punishment" does indeed have a subjective component; 

6

that it requires some kind of intent to chastise or to 

7

deter.  So I'm a little bit with Justice Kennedy, that 

8

I'm not quite sure what the word "punishment" is doing 

9

in this context, but if we're looking for punishment, we 

10
11

have indicated that punishment is a subjective concept. 
 MS. WARD: 

Yes.  In the Eighth Amendment 

12

context, because the word "punishment" appears in the 

13

Eighth Amendment, but as it's used in Bell, it's 

14

referring to X.  It's referring to evaluation of prison 

15

policies or uses of force that go too far. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but you  you  you 

17

brought punishment into this discussion.  We didn't. 

18

Justice Kagan didn't.  Your brief is full of references 

19

to punishment.  You say it's punishment that's bad. 

20

You  you want to abandon all of that?  That's 

21

that's not the criteria? 

22
23
24
25

 MS. WARD: 

No, that is the  that is the 

criteria. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't understand it, 

either.  It seems to me that there is some circumstances 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

where a guard is trying to punish someone, but there are

2

many circumstances where a guard has something totally 

3

else in mind.  He's trying to keep order in the prison. 

4

A policeman might try to stop a fleeing felon.  That has 

5

nothing to do with punishment. 

6

 And so what a guard  normally, the 

7

provision that governs the policeman is the Fourth 

8

Amendment.  I would guess that if you're talking about 

9

trying to keep order in a prison, the Due Process Clause 

10

may have something to do with it.  This person who may 

11

be awaiting a lawyer is there, his liberty confined, and 

12

you cannot use excessive force. 

13

 I ­ I 

don't see what punishment had to do 

14

with it.  But I  but I did think, and I don't know the 

15

answer, but I looked it up in the Model Penal Code, that 

16

either the policeman who's trying to stop someone, or 

17

perhaps the prison guard who's trying to keep order, 

18

cannot use excessive force. 

19

 Now, what is excessive force? 

It is force 

20

that is objectively unreasonable.  Now, suppose he does. 

21

The next question is:  Is a state of mind required?  We 

22

can imagine  it would be a weird case  but we can 

23

imagine a very weird case where the force is objectively 

24

unreasonable, but the policeman is totally innocent. 

25

Somebody told him, that is a Taser, but it's really a 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

gun.  He uses it.  Objectively unreasonable.  State of

2

mind, innocent.  Is he liable? 

3

 As far as I can tell, the government thinks 

4

he should be.  As far as I can tell, you think he should 

5

be.  End of case.  We just say everybody agrees.  Is 

6

that where we are?  Because I'm rather worried about 

7

holding the policeman in this weird case, where his

state of mind is a hundred percent innocent.  What here 

9

happened is that they read in a little bit of 

10

culpability, the least onerous subjective intent.  It's 

11

called recklessness.  You have to be aware of the risk. 

12

So I'm rather tempted to say, yes, there should be 

13

something guilty about this policeman.  Now, there's 

14

where I am at the moment, and I'd like you to explain 

15

where I should go. 

16

 MS. WARD: 

The Fourth Amendment doesn't 

17

require any inquiry into the subjective state of mind. 

18

And the Fourth Amendment test, in the case of a police 

19

officer on the street, does the job adequately.  It 

20

provides the adequate amount of deference, and it  it 

21

protects people from excessive uses of force.  That same 

22

analysis can do the job in the prison situation when a 

23

pretrial detainee's interests are at stake as well.  A 

24

subjective intent element shouldn't be required of the 

25

test at all, because that only comes in when there is a 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

question of cruel punishment.
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

At least in a prison, I 

3

would think a prison guard would have a pretty tough 

4

time thinking that if this person is in prison because 

5

he's been convicted of a crime, I can try to control his 

6

riotous behavior as long as I reasonably believe that 

7

what I'm doing is correct, even if it turns  but now I 

8

have a totally different standard, where this person's 

9

in the same cell, doing the same thing, but he hasn't 

10

yet had his trial.  He's just there waiting for his 

11

lawyer or he's been there because bail has been denied. 

12

I  I don't see how you administer such a rule. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

15

 MS. WARD: 

Can I 
What's the answer to that? 

It's okay for the standards to be 

16

different, because it's more faithful to the 

17

Constitution.  It's okay for the analysis of the 

18

excessive force claim in both situations to be 

19

different, and  and I will 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can I  I'm still 

21

struggling because we're trying to create boxes in a way 

22

that makes no sense to me.  There are all sorts of 

23

reasons for doing things, and the Eighth Amendment cases 

24

that we have, have to do with punishment qua not 

25

bringing control, not responding to a prison outbreak, 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

or a fight, or anything else, but the types of

2

conditions that are imposed on prisoners as punishment, 

3

i.e., you've broken an administrative rule, and now 

4

we're going to put you in shackles in the dark dungeon. 

5

 We've already said in one case you can't do 

6

that.  You may subjectively and legitimately think that 

7

that will keep you constrained, but that's too far. 

8

It's not  it's unwanted and unnecessarily cruel and 

9

unusual.  All right? 

10

 MS. WARD: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
But that's very 

12

different than this situation.  Whether it's a pretrial 

13

detainee or posttrial detainee, I don't think the 

14

Constitution gives you a free pass to punish a prisoner 

15

by inflicting unwanted corporal punishment.  I'm not 

16

talking about the conditions of  of punishment; i.e., 

17

good time credit, solitary confinement, segregation of 

18

some sort, deprivation of a prison job you have.  That, 

19

clearly, you need an Eighth Amendment, sort of 

20

subjective intent element. 

21

 I'm talking about the use of force for 

22

purposes of restoring discipline.  That's what this was 

23

about, wasn't it? 

24

 MS. WARD: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
So I keep saying why are

standards or any other standards or that they have to be

to convicted prisoners has already shut that door that

require  in requiring a subjective intent element for

a convicted prisoner, but it's more faithful to the

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH 

3

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

4
5
6
7

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE 
 MR. BASH: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 If there's one point I would like to convey 

8

to the Court this morning which I think is responsive to 

9

a number of questions that were asked in the opening 

10

presentation, it's that there are two relevant 

11

differences between the standard we're advancing and the 

12

standard Mr. Clement is about to get up and talk about. 

13

 One goes to what sort of purpose is 

14

required, and the other goes to how you establish that 

15

purpose. 

16

 On the first, Mr. Clement says it is 

17

malicious and sadistic intent.  We say it is a punitive 

18

purpose.  It is clear as day in the Court's Eighth 

19

Amendment cases, Farmer, Wilson, Whitley, that malicious 

20

and sadistic comes from the wantonness requirement of 

21

Eight Amendment, cruel and unusual. 

22

 He is just wrong about that. 

The only 

23

argument he has on that  that it should be malicious 

24

and sadistic is Judge Friendly's opinion that this Court 

25

cited in a couple Eighth Amendment cases.  But if you 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

look at Judge Friendly's analysis  this is on page 28

2

of the red brief  he very clearly says that there's a 

3

whole list of factors relevant.  Malicious and sadistic 

4

is one factor.  It's not dispositive, and all of the 

5

other factors are objective. 

6

 So I don't think you can extrapolate from a 

7

few citations to Judge Friendly that malicious and 

8

sadistic is appropriate for a due process claim for 

9

someone who has not convicted of an offense. 

10

 And by the way, I think 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

This is a due process case, 

right? 

13

 MR. BASH: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It 
It's not a Fourth Amendment 

15

case, and it's not an Eighth Amendment case; is that 

16

right? 

17
18
19
20
21
22

 MR. BASH: 

That's correct.  Now, Justice 

Scalia 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

bring into the due process analysis 
 MR. BASH: 

Justice Scalia, you characterize 

it as substantive due process, and 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24

 MR. BASH: 

25

It's just that you want to 

Yes. 
 I think a couple cases have 

talked about it like that, but it's not exactly 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

substantive due process.  I mean, the rule this Court has

2

established is that before you go through the procedures 

3

of the Bill of Rights conviction or a guilty plea and so 

4

forth, you may not be punished.  So it really sounds a 

5

little more in procedural due process than I think your 

6

question gave it credit for. 

7

 Now, the other point is how you establish 

8

that purpose.  Under the Eighth Amendment standards this 

9

Court has set forth, it has interpreted cruel and unusual 

10

punishment to require a degree of subjective intent. 

11

Although it has used the term "punishment" to describe 

12

the general legal standard under the Due Process Clause, 

13

of course, that clause does not say the word 

14

"punishment."  What's required 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And  and your  your 

16

standard in this case as to the pretrial detainee is 

17

that he is entitled to what protection? 

18

 MR. BASH: 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

20
21

He is 
What  what is your 

standard? 
 MR. BASH: 

It  it's exactly what Justice 

22

Rehnquist said for this Court in Bell, which is that 

23

either an intent to punish, which I take to be shorthand 

24

for an intent to achieve objectives that are  are not 

25

reasonable  reasonable at that point for that person's 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

status in the system, or, objectively, there's no 

2

reasonable relation between the use of force and those

3

objectives. 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Wait, wait, wait, wait. 

5

The first one, that's the  I mean, now you've run 

6

just run  I could say the objective part has to be 

7

objectively unreasonable force.  Now, the question is: 

8

Is there also some kind of subjective part?  And at this 

9

moment, it seems to me, on the one hand, you say, yes, 

10
11
12

and on the other hand, no. 
 MR. BASH: 

No.  I'm saying no on both hands. 

It's 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 MR. BASH: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No.  No.  In other words 
It  it is 
 even though this man, 

16

the defendant, is completely innocent, it wasn't his 

17

fault in the slightest, he wasn't even negligent, the 

18

guard is nonetheless liable.  I can't find anywhere 

19

not even in Fourth Amendment cases could I find a case 

20

where that actually occurred. 

21
22

 MR. BASH: 

Because, Justice Breyer, that's 

not what we're saying. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 MR. BASH: 

25

All right. 
I think the premise of the 

question conflates two different types of intent.  And 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

this is exactly what the court of appeals did below. 

2

There's the intent to actually do the act.  So if I 

3

if he had accidentally Tasered him 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

 MR. BASH: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

7

 or if 

 MR. BASH: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

But  but 

 MR. BASH: 

 isn't the problem. 
 that was the premise of your 

question about 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

13

 MR. BASH: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

15

 MR. BASH: 

16

 you have the intent to 

do the act, that obviously 

8

10

Obviously 

No. 
 if you think it is 
 it isn't.  It isn't. 
Well, the Taser gun question  I 

mean 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MR. BASH: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can I ask my question? 
Yes. 
It is objectively 

20

unreasonable.  But it is an odd case where the policeman 

21

is  or warden or whoever, is totally reasonable in 

22

thinking the contrary, and that focuses you on the 

23

question of whether there is some kind of either 

24

purposeful, knowledgeable, or reckless, that being the 

25

weakest, requirement in respect to the use of 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

objectively unreasonable force, not the act, but knowing 

2

that it is objectively or reckless in respect to.  You

3

see? 

4
5
6
7
8
9

 MR. BASH: 

Well, let  let me describe 

how 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I want to know what your 

view is on that. 
 MR. BASH: 

My view is this:  One, it has to 

be an intentional act.  That  that's the less 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

 MR. BASH: 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

Well, that's 
And  well, and intent 

you mean  just to  you mean voluntary? 

14

 MR. BASH: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

16

mistake with a Taser or gun? 

17

Do you mean  do 

 MR. BASH: 

Well  well, not 
Not  not a  a 

And it  no.  A mistake with a 

18

Taser or gun would not be an intentional application of 

19

force.  It would be a negligent application of force. 

20

And I think under Daniels v. Williams  that's the slip 

21

on the pillow case case  that would not count. 

22

 The question we're asking is: 

What does the 

23

connection have to be between that intentional use of 

24

force and any legitimate penological objective? 

25

 And bear in mind, the officer has to know 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

all the relevant facts.  So if you have an eggshell 

2

prisoner who has some special medical condition that

3

nobody knows about, that's not going to bear on the 

4

constitutional analysis.  It's the facts that the 

5

officer is aware of. 

6

 And I think what this Court's decisions in 

7

Bell, Block, say is that an objectively unreasonable 

8

deprivation of liberty violates the Due Process Clause. 

9

And just as confirmation that that is an objective 

10

standard in both Bell  this at page 561  and 

11

Block  this is a page 585  the Court said there's 

12

not even an allegation here that there was a punitive 

13

intent or some ill intent.  Therefore, we're going to 

14

analyze it under an objective test. 

15

 And the opinion 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17
18
19
20
21
22

Why is this different for 

inmates as  as opposed to detainees? 
 MR. BASH: 

Because what the Due Process 

Clause 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What's the test for 

inmates?  You  you don't apply the same test. 
 MR. BASH: 

The  the malicious and sadistic 

23

intent test that Mr. Clement is asking you to apply to 

24

pretrial detainees. 

25

 But remember, this would probably not only 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

apply  to pretrial detainees, certainly not only 

2

pretrial detainees in mixed populations.  It would also

3

probably apply to immigration detainees, juveniles who 

4

have not been subject to a criminal punishment, and a 

5

host of other people who have not gone through the 

6

rigors of the Bill of Rights, who have not been 

7

convicted of a crime, and never 

8
9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you agree that the 

pretrial detainee can be deprived of  of privileges 

10

because of bad behavior that's disruptive to the 

11

confinement? 

12

 MR. BASH: 

Yes.  And that's what I was 

13

getting at when I said the way that I think Justice 

14

Rehnquist used the term "punishment" in the due process 

15

cases is as shorthand for a deprivation of liberty in 

16

the prison context that has no reasonable relation to 

17

any legitimates objectives.  So if it was 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why wouldn't  why wouldn't 

19

persons who were being arrested and persons who have 

20

been convicted and are incarcerated have the same due 

21

process rights as detainees? 

22

 MR. BASH: 

Because the Due Process Clause 

23

permits the punishment of people who are convicted.  And 

24

as this Court interpreted that in the context of 

25

convicted prisoners, it's that convicted prisoners may 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1
2

be subject to hasher conditions than pretrial detainees. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So it's  so it's okay

3

to use excessive force in the case of a prisoner, 

4

somebody who has been convicted?  I mean, the question 

5

here is did  what did the police  was it 

6

objectively unreasonable to use the extent of force that 

7

was used in this case.  So are you saying that in the 

8

in the case of a convicted prisoner, that it would be 

9

okay to use excessive force? 

10

 MR. BASH: 

Well, it probably almost always 

11

violate the Eighth Amendment if there was an actual 

12

intent to punish, and the punishment was carried out by 

13

the use of force. 

14

 But I think often what we're talking about 

15

is these cases on the margin, where the officer maybe 

16

had mixed motives or whatever.  And the idea behind the 

17

Eighth Amendment jurisprudence is that we're going to 

18

amp the standard up when you're talking about someone 

19

who is subject to the penological force of the State. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Can you give us an example 

21

of what a guard could do to an inmate and a guard could 

22

not do to a pretrial detainee, other than for 

23

rehabilitation purposes? 

24
25

 MR. BASH: 

I don't think the use of force as 

discipline is ever appropriate.  But, you know, in a 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

in a max prison where you only have felony convicts, I 

2

think, at the margins, officers are willing  to be able to

3

use slightly more force than they can with pretrial 

4

detainees where people who are held, as this Court said 

5

in Salerno, in regulatory detention.  Admittedly 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I think it's 

7

pretty unusual, isn't it, to have a pretrial detainee in 

8

a maximum security prison? 

9

 MR. BASH: 

No.  I  I was just trying to 

10

identify for Justice Kennedy how the standard at the 

11

margins might be different, so when you're talking 

12

about 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And you come up with 

14

a hypothetical, I think, is quite unrealistic, so I'm 

15

not sure it's responsive. 

16
17
18

 MR. BASH: 

I ­ I didn't mean to come up with a 

hypothetical. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm even not sure why 

19

that's right.  Why  you get a free  the Constitution 

20

permits you to get a free kick in? 

21
22
23

 MR. BASH: 

That  that's  that is 

certainly 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So if you walk by a 

24

prisoner and, you know, I want to establish discipline 

25

so I can freely kick them any time I want? 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

 MR. BASH: 

That's certainly not what we're 

2

saying.  What we are saying is that the prohibition on

3

what officers can do to convicted prisoners is they 

4

cannot punish them cruelly and unusually.  And it makes 

5

sense that this Court has upped the subjective intent 

6

standard with respect to convicted prisoners because it 

7

reflects that the constitutional prohibition is only 

8

cruel and unusual punishment.  Here is a 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Bash, would you 

10

explain?  I mean, you agree that it's only the objective 

11

standard, use of excessive force, but then your bottom 

12

line is the same as the Respondent, that is, you think 

13

that this  this verdict should hold and it should not 

14

be any new trial.  Can you explain how your bottom line 

15

is the same as Respondent, but your standard is the same 

16

as Petitioner? 

17

 MR. BASH: 

I would take the Court to page 

18

277 and 278 of the Joint Appendix, which lists the 

19

pertinent jury instructions.  And the  the jury was 

20

instructed to find four elements, three of them no one 

21

is contesting at this stage.  The third one is the key 

22

element.  This is on page 278.  And it said, "Defendants 

23

knew that using force presented a risk of harm to 

24

Plaintiff, but they recklessly disregarded Plaintiff's 

25

safety.  If it"  full stop there, I would agree you 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

naturally infer that, at least on this review, as 

2

importing a subjective element.  But then it tells you

3

exactly what recklessly disregarded Plaintiff's safety 

4

means.  By failing to take reasonable measures to 

5

minimize the  the risk of harm to Plaintiff.  And I 

6

see that as no different than the proportionality 

7

standard that Bell itself requires.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. PAUL D. CLEMENT 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 This Court should adopt  adopt the 

15

subjective test fashioned by Judge Friendly in Johnson 

16

against Glick in addressing a due process claim for 

17

excessive force by a pretrial detainee. 

18

 This Court has already adopted that standard 

19

in the Eighth Amendment context for convicted prisoners, 

20

and both doctrinal and practical reasons strongly 

21

suggest that it should apply the same test in the due 

22

process context in which that test originated, and the 

23

contrary propositions are simply not compatible with 

24

this Court's precedents. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

In Johnson and Glick, the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

bottom line was that there was reliability; isn't that 

2

so?

3

 MR. CLEMENT: 

No, Justice Ginsburg.  The 

4

bottom line was a remand so that there could be a  a 

5

factual determination based on the Four Factor Test that 

6

Judge Friendly articulated. 

7

 So in the lower courts, they dismissed the 

8

claim.  Judge Friendly recognized that the Due Process 

9

Clause does provide protection, and then he articulated 

10

that Four Factor Test, one important part of which is a 

11

subjective factor that, I think, sensibly tries to 

12

distinguish those situations where an officer is trying 

13

to use force in a good faith effort to maintain order 

14

and discipline and contrast that with a situation where 

15

the force is being used sadistically or maliciously for 

16

the very purpose of inflicting pain. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if we look at 

18

this  this case, the conduct was deliberate, using the 

19

Taser was deliberate.  The effect known to the officer 

20

was that it would cause pain.  So what subjective 

21

element other than when using  I'm deliberately using 

22

force, I know it will cause pain.  What beyond that? 

23

 MR. CLEMENT: 

So the question is:  Is this a 

24

good faith effort to try to get these handcuffs off, or 

25

is this somebody who's acting simply to punish the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

the detainee?  And I think that's what the good faith 

2

test really gets to.  It gets to what, I think, in some

3

respects is the nub of the issue here. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, let's put the nub 

5

of the issue here.  Let me give you the fact  let's 

6

use this actual situation. 

7

 The  the defendant says, I wasn't 

8

resisting, I wasn't spreading my arms apart, I was just 

9

laying there, and they came and Tased me.  All right. 

10

The officers say instead he was pulling his arms and 

11

resisting it so we couldn't get the handcuffs open.  So 

12

assuming a jury credits the Petitioner, what would that 

13

do under  how would that be evaluated under your test? 

14

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I suppose that if the 

15

jury actually credited Petitioner's versions of events, 

16

they might be able to find liability under the John 

17

Johnson v. Glick standard.  I think it's worth recognizing 

18

that there was a jury trial here, and under a recklessness 

19

standard, they ruled in favor of our clients, and it 

20

seems to me that it would be very odd to have to have a 

21

new jury trial. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Let's go back 

23

to  that's why I keep trying to go back to what is 

24

the  what are the  under what circumstances and how 

25

does your test get to the gratuitous use of violence or 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1
2

the excessive use of violence where it's unnecessary? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I think it gets to it in

3

a way that provides a degree of deference to the 

4

difficult decisions that the guard has to make, which is 

5

it recognizes that unlike the arrest context in other 

6

situations, prison environment's different.  There are 

7

going to be lots of situations where guards are going to 

8

use force and legitimately. 

9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
going to be given anyway. 

11

 MR. CLEMENT: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13
14

But that instruction is 

What's that? 
Under  under the Bell 

v. Wolfish case, that presumption was given anyhow. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, but I  I don't  I 

15

mean, I think there are real differences between the 

16

instruction, and if you look at ­ the way  the clearest 

17

way to illustrate this is if you look at Joint Appendix 

18

page 78 and you look at the instruction that was offered 

19

by the Petitioners below, it flat out says you can't take 

20

into account the good faith intent of the officer.  It's 

21

irrelevant. 

22

 Now, I think that's perfectly appropriate in 

23

a Fourth Amendment instruction where there's objective 

24

reasonableness, and this Court said a bunch of times 

25

that the subjective intent of the officer doesn't 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

matter. 

2

 But in the difficult context of a prison, I

3

think Judge Friendly got it right, I think this Court 

4

got it right with respect to convicted prisoners, which 

5

is you give the guard a little bit of flexibility 

6

because it's a difficult situation.  And if you say 

7

after the fact, maybe they shouldn't have used the 

8

Taser, or if, in a case where they used the Taser twice, 

9

maybe they should've used it once, but not twice, those 

10

questions of degree ought to be some degree of 

11

deference. 

12

 This test allows for that. 

It gives a jury 

13

a landing place.  If they look at this in hindsight and 

14

say, you know, I wish they hadn't used the Taser, but I 

15

think they were doing it to get the handcuffs off.  This 

16

isn't a case like Hudson against McMillan where they 

17

were just taking the guy out and beating him up 

18

punitively.  So I don't think there should be a 

19

Constitutional violation here. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, that's true  you 

21

know, what you say is equally true where you're running 

22

a jail, isn't it?  And it's equally true where the 

23

person in the jail is  has been convicted or hasn't 

24

been convicted.  The need for order is the same. 

25

 So how would it apply in a circumstance 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

where there's a claim of excessive force to someone who 

2

has been convicted, but it has nothing to do with

3

punishment.  No one thinks it has to do with punishment. 

4

The situation was one where they were trying to maintain 

5

order, or the situation was one where they were trying 

6

to give medical treatment, or the situation was any one 

7

of a thousand. 

8
9

 What I can't see is why the punishment 
standard should apply whether he's been convicted or 

10

not.  And I also can't see why they should be different 

11

whether he's been convicted or not. 

12

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I think the punishment 

13

standard applies in both cases, Justice Breyer, because 

14

the relevant constitutional text has been interpreted to 

15

require punishment.  In the Eighth Amendment context 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But suppose you brought a 

17

lawsuit under the Due Process Clause?  I mean  and 

18

there are instances where people are seized in jail, so 

19

it was under the Fourth Amendment. 

20

 I mean, why is punishment in these other 

21

situations?  I can't figure that one out.  I can't 

22

figure out  and then I looked at the Model Penal Code. 

23

The Model Penal Code seems to require both excessive 

24

force and some kind of state of mind, which could be 

25

recklessness, which is what the judge said here or maybe 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1
2

even negligence. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, obviously, if you adopt,

3

as this Court has in the Eighth Amendment context, the 

4

understanding that punishment inherently requires some 

5

subjective mental state, the lowest available mental 

6

state is recklessness and under that standard, which the 

7

jury clearly was instructed under, we would prevail.  So 

8

that would lead to an affirmance. 

9

 Now, I would still think, since it is 

10

wellestablished that the relevant standard for 

11

excessive force in cases involving convicted prisoners 

12

is the Johnson v. Glick standard, I think since that's 

13

established and nobody here is asking for Whitley or 

14

Hudson to be overruled, and there are so many practical 

15

imperatives for treating pretrial detainees and 

16

convicted prisoners the same, I think this Court should 

17

apply the Johnson v. Glick standard in the due process 

18

claims of pretrial detainees. 

19

 In a subsequent case, if the Court wants to 

20

reconsider what the test should be even under the Eighth 

21

Amendment and apply it uniformly across pretrial 

22

detainees and convicted inmates, that may make some 

23

sense. 

24
25

 I also think there's some very interesting 
questions lurking out there about what kind of objective 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

evidence of unreasonableness is enough in an Eighth 

2

Amendment case, or if we prevail, a Fifth Amendment

3

case, what kind of objective evidence is enough to get 

4

to the jury on the subjective intent question.  I think 

5

those are all questions that this Court may eventually 

6

have to confront, but I think the first step in a case 

7

where nobody wants to overrule Hudson and Whitley is to 

8

suggest that since the imperatives that the officers 

9

face with respect to pretrial detainees and convicted 

10
11

inmates are essentially identical. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

tell us why that's so? 

13

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Why is that?  Why don't you 

Well, I'll  I'll tell you 

14

why that's so.  And it's so in these  particularly in 

15

a  in a local jail like Monroe County, Wisconsin, 

16

where you have these individuals, they're housed side by 

17

side.  As the Chief Justice has alluded to, in this kind 

18

of jail, the only way you can serve their sentence as a 

19

convicted individual is if you've been convicted for a 

20

relatively minor offense.  But if you're there pretrial, 

21

awaiting your trial, any  any  any book  any 

22

any offense in the criminal book could be your charge of 

23

 that  where you're being held for, so it could be a 

24

murderer.  And I think this Court has recognized, and 

25

this  I mean, this is empirically true  this Court 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

has recognized this empirical fact, first in Bell 

2

against Wolfish, then in Block against Rutherford,

3

and  and more recently, in the Florence County case. 

4

When you 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Clement, sorry.  There's 

6

a lot to what you say that sometimes the practical 

7

concerns are the same for pretrial detainees and for 

8

convicted criminals.  There's also something to the 

9

other point of view, which is that in our cases, we've 

10

consistently said that if you're a pretrial detainee, if 

11

you haven't been found to have committed wrongful 

12

conduct, you shouldn't be treated the same way as people 

13

who have been found to have committed wrongful conduct; 

14

that for the convicted criminals, it's kind of, you 

15

know, we're allowed to punish them, because they've done 

16

something wrong.  And we haven't found that yet for the 

17

pretrial detainees. 

18

 And so what place in your system is there 

19

for that, you know, very commonsensical, and also, you 

20

know, normatively attractive proposition that people who 

21

haven't been found to have done anything ought not to be 

22

treated with the same level of disregard for their 

23

interests as people who have been? 

24
25

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Justice Kagan, there is a 

place for that in the doctrine.  I would submit it's not 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

in the excessive force cases.  So let me tell you where 

2

I think it is.  I mean, Sandin against Conner is a good

3

example.  There the Court said that with convicted 

4

individuals, it was perfectly permissible to move them 

5

from minimum security to maximum security as a punitive 

6

matter, and you didn't even have to give them any 

7

process to do that.  I don't think that same analysis 

8

would apply to pretrial detainees. 

9

 Another example is footnote 17 of the Bell 

10

against Wolfish case, where I think it's understood that 

11

at least if the statutory law provides for it, that if 

12

you're convicted, you can be sent out to the work gang 

13

and have to pick up trash along the highway.  I don't 

14

think you can do that to a pretrial detainee.  But 

15

whatever differences there are, I don't think they arise 

16

in an excessive force context.  I think if you think 

17

about this Court's cases, and start with Whitley.  If 

18

you're trying to quell a prison riot, and you have an 

19

inmate who's going up the stairs, trying to go where 

20

there's an unarmed guard, it doesn't make a whit of 

21

difference whether that inmate is a pretrial detainee or 

22

a  a  a convicted individual. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So that might be, but let's 

24

take another comparison.  And the comparison is two 

25

people who have been indicted for the same offense, and 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

one makes bail and he's out on the street, and the other 

2

doesn't make bail, and so he is in an institutional

3

facility.  And the one who's out on the street has some 

4

kind of encounter with a police officer, and he reaches 

5

into his pocket to take out something, and the police 

6

officer shoots him.  And let's just imagine that 

7

circumstances are such that this is utterly 

8

unreasonable. 

9

 And then the same  the same person 

10

indicted for the same offense, not convicted of that 

11

offense, same circumstances, the police shoot him, now 

12

he's not going to be treated in any respect the same 

13

way.  Why should that be so? 

14

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I think because the fact of 

15

incarceration really is a gamechanger.  When that 

16

person's out on bail, nobody is going to know that, so 

17

he has exactly  or she, the exact same expectations as 

18

any reasonable individual.  The same expectations as the 

19

individual in Graham v. Connor, who's doing nothing more 

20

than trying to buy orange juice in a convenience store. 

21

 There are rules that apply to that, and they 

22

should be sufficient and they should be objective, and 

23

that's the Fourth Amendment standard. 

24

 When you're in the incarceration context, 

25

things are different.  The margin for error for the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

guards is quite different.  The need to protect the 

2

other inmates from a potentially violent person doesn't

3

have the same kind of direct analogue when something's 

4

unfolding on the streets.  Sometimes it can, but the 

5

quarters, I think, are  are going to be different, in 

6

the main, in the incarceration context.  And so I think 

7

it makes sense to apply a standard that's slightly more 

8

forgiving of the prison guards than of the police 

9

officers. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And I  I still find it 

11

very hard to understand how use of force can be excessive 

12

without being at least reckless.  It's  it's confusing. 

13

For excessive use of force, but yet what  what does the 

14

reckless add to it?  If  if it's an excessive use of 

15

force, isn't that at least reckless by definition? 

16

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I think often it will be. 

17

We're not here to defend the recklessness instruction as 

18

the platonic sort of form.  We actually think that 

19

applying Judge Friendly's instruction from Johnson 

20

against Glick is the right way to go, which we think 

21

provides a little more separation between the two. 

22

 I don't think, though  I mean, we can 

23

we can obviously come up with hypothetical situations 

24

where there are going to be different applications.  I 

25

think the principal difference here is this instruction, 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

both in the Eighth Amendment context, and in the due 

2

process context in Johnson v. Glick, I think it gives

3

the jury a practical landing place when they think, you 

4

know, with the benefit of hindsight, I wish the police 

5

 I wish the corrections officer hadn't done that, but 

6

I don't think it was completely outside of the bounds of 

7

what was reasonable.  I certainly don't think it's so 

8

purposeless and so arbitrary that it gives rise to an 

9

inference that it had a punitive motive. 

10

 That gives the jury kind of a reasonable 

11

landing place, and I think this case is actually a 

12

pretty good illustration of this.  I think if you look 

13

at this and you ask yourself, was it reasonable to use 

14

the Taser?  That's a debatable question.  Was it really 

15

punitive?  Was it unrelated to an interest in trying to 

16

get the handcuffs off?  Of course not. 

17

 And so I do think in cases like this, it 

18

gives the jury an appropriate landing place to come up 

19

and make a judgment that doesn't second guess the 

20

officers.  And this Court has said so many times that 

21

deference to prison officials is an important value. 

22

And I think this test that we've proposed that, again, 

23

originates with Judge Friendly in a due process case 

24

gives 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you're giving 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

you're  you're loading the deck completely, because 

2

you're instructing the jury first to give the police

3

officers deference, and then you're now giving them an 

4

instruction that assumes that whatever they do is okay. 

5

 MR. CLEMENT: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't think so.  I think 
I mean, there's no 

7

there's  by adding that kind of subjective intent that 

8

you want, maliciousness and wantonness, which are not 

9

are only one part, as your  as the Assistant Solicitor 

10
11
12
13

General said, only one part of the Johnson test. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

But  but if I  if I 

could 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You're  you're  the 

14

way you've articulated in your brief has really loaded 

15

the deck completely. 

16

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, in  in fairness, and 

17

to correct the Assistant Solicitor General, the 

18

instruction we asked for, which is at Joint Appendix 65, 

19

it has all of the Johnson factors.  Now, it focuses, as 

20

we think  and that's the pattern jury instruction in 

21

an excessive force case for a prisoner in the Seventh 

22

Circuit, we think it gets it right, which is it focuses 

23

the ultimate inquiry on this, is it a punitive intent or 

24

is it a good faith effort to restore order. 

25

 But then if you look for the factors that 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

the jury can consider, all four  all the rest of the 

2

Johnson factors are there.  And we think that's actually

3

the best reading of Bell v. Wolfish, too, which is to 

4

say it provides objective factors, but then it's 

5

basically asking, you can look at those objective 

6

factors and it allows ­ 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that ­ 

8

 MR. CLEMENT:  you to infer a punitive intent.

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Bell v.  Bell v. 

10

Wolfish, the first part of the application section of 

11

that opinion goes to whether there's an intent to 

12

punish.  It assumes there's not, and then it goes to the 

13

objective test and says, in that particular case, that 

14

the conditions met that  those conditions as well, but 

15

it treated it as alternative.  That's 

16

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I think alternative ways 

17

to prove a punitive intent.  And if you look at Bell v. 

18

Wolfish, when it talks about those objective factors, it 

19

then says, so if you have purposeless or arbitrary 

20

government action, the court may infer an intent to 

21

punish.  So it's objective factors in service of what is 

22

ultimately a subjective inquiry. 

23

 The other thing I think that needs to be 

24

added, though, is that Bell v. Wolfish, you know, we 

25

think we win under it.  But it is a test that was really 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

designed to judge some conditions questions.  And we 

2

think Johnson against Glick, and we think, in the  in 

3

the Eighth Amendment context, Whitley and  and Hudson, 

4

are directed at the unique dynamic that you have in

5

excessive force cases. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Am I right that the 

7

pattern instruction in  in this case, the pattern 

8

instruction asked only the excessive force question, 

9

asked the jury to decide whether the force was excessive 

10
11

in light of the particular facts and circumstances? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, okay.  So there were two 

12

pattern instructions, neither of which were used.  There 

13

was the pattern instruction which my friends wanted to 

14

have, which was the Fourth Amendment pattern 

15

instruction.  There was the pattern instruction that was 

16

the Eighth Amendment standard that we wanted to have. 

17

And Judge Crabb essentially split the difference and 

18

came up with this nonpattern jury instruction that asked 

19

the excessive force question, and baked in this notion 

20

of recklessness. 

21

 Now, we think obviously that the lowest 

22

standard of intent that could be compatible with the Due 

23

Process Clause is recklessness, and so we think you 

24

should affirm if you think recklessness is the standard. 

25

But in fairness, we think the most coherent way to 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

approach this issue is to apply a single unitary 

2

standard to pretrial detainees and postconvicted 

3

inmates when you're talking about these kind of 

4

excessive force claims.

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Clement, why not look at 

6

it this way?  I mean, you said  and it's really the 

7

basis of your argument  that being in an institutional 

8

setting is the gamechanger.  There's no doubt it's 

9

important. 

10

 But there's another potential gamechanger 

11

as well, and that is this question of have you actually 

12

been convicted?  Has the legal system found that you're 

13

a person who is a wrongdoer? 

14

 So if we say that both of these things are 

15

important, why shouldn't we adopt a set of principles 

16

that say it is  we're  we're looking for objectively 

17

reasonable conduct, but in looking for that, of course 

18

we take into account the prison circumstances.  Of 

19

course we take into account the context in making that 

20

evaluation, so that the person on the street does not 

21

necessarily come up with the same result as the person 

22

in prison because the contexts are different. 

23

 But still, the test, the basic test is the 

24

same because they are both people who have not been 

25

found to have done anything wrong. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, a couple of responses, 

2

Justice Kagan.  I mean, obviously, you could try to take 

3

the Fourth Amendment test and you could adjust it  try 

4

to adjust it for the prison conditions.

5

 We don't think that that's going to work in 

6

a way that gives sufficient deference to the prison 

7

officials.  We do think  this Court has said so many 

8

times they are in a unique environment.  It's not 

9

something that the normal jury is going to have any sort 

10

of insight into.  So I think if you just ask them was it 

11

reasonable in hindsight, I don't think you're going to 

12

get sufficient deference.  So that's one reason. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I would think that the jury 

14

would give a lot of deference to prison officials, in 

15

part because they are unfamiliar with the circumstances. 

16

And folks will come in and will say, you know, here's 

17

I think that there's  that  that that will be the 

18

natural tendency. 

19

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I mean, I hope you're right 

20

for the sake of my clients, but I think that tendency is 

21

going to be embodied much more if you let them take into 

22

account good faith.  And I think that's a really 

23

important way of thinking about the question here, 

24

because if you look at their proposed jury instruction, 

25

at JA 78, it's the one thing the jury is told they can't 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

take into account, is whether there was good faith.  And 

2

that does not seem particularly productive. 

3

 Another point you made was that, you know, 

4

there is this difference that these individuals are 

5

have not been convicted.  And I do think that's 

6

important, and I've talked about a couple of instances 

7

where I think that that makes an outcomedeterminative 

8

difference. 

9

 But you also have to take into account that 

10

the Bell decision itself said the presumption of 

11

innocence has nothing, really, to do with this.  And I 

12

think that was a reflection of the reality that when 

13

the  an institution is trying to deal with pretrial 

14

detainees and inmates, it's not dealing with different 

15

entities. 

16

 Another thing I'd like to say about Bell v. 

17

Wolfish is I do think it's an analysis that applies most 

18

readily to conditions cases.  And there are a number of 

19

cases we cite in footnote 9 of our red brief involving 

20

the lower courts' applications of various tests 

21

requiring subjective intent.  There's a D.C. Circuit 

22

case called Norris against the District of Columbia.  I 

23

paid more attention on rereading it because I noticed 

24

that Justice Ginsburg had written the opinion. 

25

 It's decided in 1984, and I think it's 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

actually quite instructive because in 1984, the D.C. 

2

Circuit had the benefit of Bell v. Wolfish.  It also 

3

had the benefit of Johnson against Glick.  And when it 

4

confronted an excessive force claim, as opposed to a

5

conditions claim, the D.C. Circuit looked to Johnson 

6

against Glick and not to Bell v. Wolfish, which it 

7

doesn't even cite, to provide the relevant standard. 

8

 And I think that just shows that 
Judge Friendly got this one right.  He has an analysis 

10

that of course looks to objective factors in terms of 

11

the amount of force used, the need for the force, the 

12

relationship of the two, but also says, was this a good 

13

faith effort to maintain or  or restore order, or was 

14

this something that was just sadistic and malicious with 

15

the intent to cause harm? 

16

 My friends from the Solicitor General 

17

Office, I guess, don't like the words "salist  sadistic 

18

and malicious."  I looked them up.  I mean, they sound 

19

kind of rough, but they actually  you know, Judge 

20

Friendly got that right, too.  I mean, they're words 

21

that basically mean exactly what he said in the rest 

22

of the sentence 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

24

 MR. CLEMENT: 

25

But if you really 
 which is there's no

 JUSTICE KAGAN:

 MR. CLEMENT: 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 if you really 
 other than to cause harm. 
 want to take the 

4

Judge Friendly test  and I guess you've talked about

5

this before, but it is a multifactor test where the 

6

question of sadisticness is counting as a plus factor, 

7

a thumb on the scales.  But it's clear under that test 

8

that even if that sadistic quality isn't there, it's 

9

still allowable to hold the prison official to have 

10
11

violated the law. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

I  I don't think that's the 

12

right reading of it, which is I think the ultimate 

13

question under that test, and that's certainly the way 

14

it's been applied by this Court in the Eighth Amendment 

15

context, and you see that in this pattern jury 

16

instruction that we propose. 

17

 The ultimate test is, is this a good faith 

18

effort to maintain order, or is this an effort to 

19

inflict punishment just for the sake of punishment?  And 

20

then the rest of the factors inform that as, of course, 

21

they always would. 

22

 And I think one way of thinking about the 

23

question before the Court in this case is that this 

24

Court has already borrowed the  the Johnson v. Glick 

25

factors that were due process factors  they've already 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

borrowed them and used them in the Eighth Amendment 

2

context. 

3

 And the question in this case is should they 

4

take that due process test and apply it in a due process

5

case?  And that doesn't sound like a difficult question, 

6

and I really don't think it is.  I think this Court got 

7

it right in Hudson and Whitley.  You think about those 

8

cases.  Whitley, it wouldn't matter whether or not that 

9

individual going towards an unarmed guard was pretrial 

10

or postconviction.  But in Hudson it's the opposite.  I 

11

mean, Hudson is this case where you have somebody who is 

12

singled out for a punitive beating in response to an 

13

altercation with the guard. 

14

 Again, it makes no difference. 

That's not 

15

acceptable behavior, whether or not they are an inmate 

16

who's been convicted or pretrial detainee.  Applying one 

17

test to both of these very similar individuals seems to 

18

be the appropriate response. 

19

 If there are no further questions.

 Ms. Ward, 4 minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WENDY M. WARD 

23

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

24

 MS. WARD: 

25

 Justice  Justice Kagan got it exactly 

Thank you. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

right.  The institutional setting is not the 

2

gamechanger.  The gamechanger is the fact of lawful 

3

conviction pursuant to due process.  That's  that's 

4

the  the dividing line between the right test and the

5

wrong test. 

6

 Justice Ginsburg also was looking at 

7

recklessness in our jury instructions, and you  you got 

8

it right also.  Disregard  reckless disregard of 

9

someone's rights has no place in a jury instruction that 

10
11

should be objective. 
 And I want to step through the jury 

12

instructions because we part ways with Mr. Bash on the 

13

jury instructions in particular.  If you look at  part 

14

of the confusion comes in in the three different uses of 

15

recklessness in the jury instructions, as the dissent 

16

below noted.  There's three different ways that 

17

recklessness is used. 

18

 If you look at 277 of the Joint Appendix, 

19

the first use of recklessness is that force is applied 

20

recklessly.  Well, here we're asking whether force is 

21

force is less than deliberate if you look at how force 

22

applied recklessly is  is used in Farmer, for example, 

23

deliberate indifference.  You're looking at  you're 

24

you're conflating deliberate indifference with a 

25

deliberate act.  That's confusing. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

 And Question No. 1 of the special verdict 

2

questions, excessive force means force applied 

3

recklessly that is unreasonable.  So the  again, this 

4

is what I was talking about, force applied recklessly;

5

that's also not deliberate. 

6

 And then the  the plaintiff is required to 

7

prove each of the following factors by a preponderance 

8

of the evidence.  Factor 2 is the reasonableness test. 

9

Factor 3, which is in addition to the reasonableness 

10

test, is reckless disregard of plaintiff's safety, which 

11

is, again, a different use from acting recklessly. 

12

And  and it's that reckless disregard for plaintiff's 

13

safety language that the Court said in Farmer was 

14

unquestionably related to a culpable state of mind. 

15

 And then if there's any question about 

16

whether reckless in our jury instructions were related 

17

to a bad intent, the third use of recklessness, which is 

18

on 278 about halfway down the page, acted with 

19

recklessness disregard of plaintiff's rights.  The jury 

20

instructions defined that specifically not in the  the 

21

special verdict itself, but in the  the instruction on 

22

punitive damages, which is found on page 281, where the 

23

court said to the jury that an action is in reckless 

24

disregard of plaintiff's rights if, under the 

25

circumstances, it reflects complete indifference to the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

plaintiff's safety or rights.  If you find that 


2


defendant's conduct was motivated by evil motive or 


3


intent, unquestionable bad intent related to that 


4


element of reckless  or that version of recklessness

5

that was used in the jury instructions. 

6

 If the Court has no further questions.
