ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH M. GALANTER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GALANTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Virginia Office for Protection and

12

Advocacy, known as "VOPA," seeks to enforce its Federal

13

statutory right to inspect and copy records that are in

14

the possession of State officials who run State-operated

15

hospitals.

16

Respondents acknowledged below that if

17

Petitioner were a private entity, Ex parte Young would

18

permit this suit.

19

not change the Ex parte Young analysis because it

20

imposed neither a greater burden on the treasury nor the

21

dignity of the State.

22

the Federal court is who has the correct reading of

23

Federal law about the records access issue.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say on page 27

10

of your brief, the blue brief, that there's no big deal

11

here with respect to State sovereignty because

12

ultimately the sovereign retains the authority to

13

dissolve the State agency plaintiff if the State

14

believes the litigation is too onerous.

15

MR. GALANTER:

That -- that's correct.

That

16

is, the sovereign, the Commonwealth, could repeal the

17

law that enacted VOPA, just as in this Court's cases,

18

ICC v. United States, Congress could have removed -­

19

eliminated the ICC.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a good -- a

21

good cite for your proposition, but arguably in those

22

cases, the ICC is really not the real party in interest.

23

The real party in interest is the beneficiary of the ICC

back to my question, you -- no court would entertain

MR. GALANTER:

If -- if that's right, and I

11

think it is if they're part of the same -- if they're

12

subsidiaries of one corporation and aren't separate.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, why is that true?

14

If they're separate corporate entities, what legal rule

15

would stop a separate corporate entity from suing

16

another?

the same company, that's a different issue, and just a

19

different branch or a different office.

MR. GALANTER:

I do believe then that there

could be litigation between them, but ultimately there

3

wouldn't be.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I would have

5

thought that would become an advisory opinion.

6

an internal dispute, basically, and your -- in that

7

hypothetical, one of the entities would be asking the

8

Federal court to resolve it.

of the day how it wants to resolve it.

Ford has

If Ford West

10

wins and Ford East loses, Ford can say, all right, this

11

is how we're going to do it regardless of what the

12

Federal court says.

13

MR. GALANTER:

Well, that's true that after

14

the litigation is over, one of the parties may, you

15

know, be able to work around the law.

fact, in every Federal Spending Clause statute where

17

you're dealing with prospective relief.

the case.

MR. GALANTER:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MR. GALANTER:

Oh.

But the Respondents here are

6

State officials, and even the Respondents' agency has no

7

power over IPAS.

8

governor and the attorney general have no control over

9

what IPAS -- excuse me -- VOPA does.

10

And on the day-to-day basis, even the

IPAS is a similar

case out of Indiana.

11

But what's critical here is that, as we

12

stand here today, the Commonwealth has vested a Federal

13

right in VOPA, and neither the attorney general nor the

14

governor of Virginia can stop VOPA from exercising that

15

right.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I'm -- I'm not

17

quite sure what the premise of your argument is.

You

18

seem to be arguing that the independence of the State

19

agency is what makes this particular entity capable of

20

suing.

21

test, which says if you're asserting a Federal claim,

22

you can sue and you're not -- and you're looking for

23

prospective injunctive relief, you can sue the State.

That general rule wouldn't look at who's suing.

was part of your argument.

Yet, in your brief, you rely on Verizon's simple

And if it is the one

about the State's independence, how do you articulate

significance of that vis-à-vis this case and any ones

7

moving forward?

MR. GALANTER:

What's the legal

If I may, I -- there are -­

there are three issues that are intertwined here.

That's where the independence is

The second question is the one that we

15

petitioned on, which is the Eleventh Amendment issue,

16

and there we would suggest that the simple

17

straightforward inquiry of Verizon is relevant.

18

And then there's a third portion which the

19

court of appeals seemed to rely on, which is that -­

20

that the notion that the State has a Federal right at

21

all was -- against another part of the State and its

officials was incongruous.

MR. GALANTER:

It -- it is not the case in

Virginia or in 49 of the 50 States.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

Well, if it were and

15

if Congress offered money to the State and the only way

16

the State could get it would be to abandon its system of

17

separation of powers and to allow an agency of the State

18

which would normally be under the direction of the

19

governor to go riding off on its own and -- and sue the

other officials in the State to bring them into

as I said, though -- and this statute authorizes the

State, if it takes the money, to designate either a

public or a private entity as its protection and

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, right, but

Court, I would suppose the Article III question is a

2

jurisdictional one that we have to address before

reaching the Eleventh Amendment question.

4

MR. GALANTER:

5

both sufficiently jurisdictional that you could reach

before the Eleventh Amendment.

Mr. Galanter, if we can

go back to get what this -- this entity was.

Federal legislation gives the States a choice.

specification that the State agency has to be

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And does it do anything

else other than administer the Federal program?
MR. GALANTER:

It has a few responsibilities

4

that the State has given it under State law in addition,

5

but its primary function -- and at this point all its

6

budget comes from the Federal Government, and it serves

7

primarily this Federal function to go into public and

8

private institutions to observe and make sure that abuse

9

and neglect is not occurring there.

10

And that is, obviously, why these records

11

were requested, because the statute gives the protection

12

and advocacy service a right to access records of people

13

in the institutions to make sure that they are not being

14

mistreated and that the investigations and the

15

oversights by the State are taking place and are being

16

done correctly.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, following up on

18

Justice Scalia's question to you, his question in fact

19

is in part what happened here.

20

did require every State agency to seek the permission of

21

its attorney general, is it, to sue?

22

said that's not independent enough, and if you want the

23

money, you've got to make VOPA eligible to sue without

that permission; is that correct?

it in your brief, too onerous, the State can say:

what, the case is over, you're dissolved.

16

I mean, if VOPA files a discovery

MR. GALANTER:

Guess

Well, I -- again, I would go

17

back to the Federal analogy, that in all this litigation

18

with the ICC or -- well, with the Federal labor

19

relations authorities, with the licensing authority of

20

the Department of Interior for dams that -- that, you

21

know, the TVA might want to build, that Congress can

22

still in existence -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess, in Nixon v. United

States, the President could have dismissed the attorney

general, but we allowed the suit to go forward.

2

did understand that.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. GALANTER:

I never

Well, I think -- I think it's

5

because you look at standing in terms of the current

6

reality, and in Nixon, for example, the attorney general

7

had promulgated a regulation saying he couldn't dismiss

8

the special prosecutor except for cause.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But there are a number of

10

instances in the States where constitutional officers

11

have their separate autonomy, their separate

12

responsibilities.

13

inevitably from your position that the attorney general

14

of State A could sue the governor of State A saying the

15

governor is being sued in an Ex parte Young capacity

16

because the governor is not following Federal law.

17

think that's just inevitable from your -- from you

18

position, and that seems to me a vast extension of Ex

19

parte Young.

20

that the identity of -- or the permissibility of an Ex

21

parte Young suit depends on the identity of the

22

plaintiff, but don't we have to say that here if we're

23

going to allow the States to structure their -- their

24

own governments as they choose?

25

And it seems to me to follow

I

It's true, I think, that we've never said

MR. GALANTER:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

well, I would say two things.

2

you have to accept, as I think Respondents do in this

3

case, that the Virginia Office of Protection and

4

Advocacy legitimately holds a Federal right.

5

I am hard pressed, and -- and Respondents and their

6

amici were hard pressed, to come up with any example

7

where an attorney general would hold a Federal right

8

against another part of the State.

9

here -­

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

First, the idea that -­

I can't --

11

governor that the governor is not giving adequate

12

protection to prison inmates or State employees, that

13

the -- that the governor's own personnel regulations are

14

incorrect, and he would sue under Ex parte Young.

15

MR. GALANTER:

Federal rights.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

under -- under your theory there would be, because under

person can allege that this fictional private individual

who's really a governmental individual is violating a

EPA wants clean water, and the Army Corps of Engineers

4

MS. ANDERS:

Well, they're both -- the heads

5

of both agencies are, in that situation, I think,

6

subject to removal by the same people, and so in that

7

situation, you would have an Article III problem.

8

we don't have that problem here, because VOPA is

independent under State law, and -­

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

Do you agree with

11

the Petitioners that Virginia can dissolve VOPA if it

12

finds the litigation too onerous?

13

MS. ANDERS:

I think that that would not

14

happen in practice, because if Virginia were to dissolve

15

VOPA, it would be out of compliance with the Federal

16

scheme, and so it would lose its -- it would lose its

Federal funding at that point.

18

that's a situation that's going to arise, but -­

And so I don't think

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

to arise, do you think that they can -- do you agree

with the Petitioners that they can do it?

MS. ANDERS:

I think they -- I think they

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you be a little

11

bit more specific for me on what you mean about an

13

about State attorney generals willy-nilly suing -- or

not willy-nilly -- suing governors to comply with

Federal law.

Justice Kennedy was concerned

Why do you think it won't happen, and what
are the legal impediments to that occurring?
MS. ANDERS:

I think there are several.

I

19

think, first, you would have to have a Federal right

20

that the AG would be able to enforce.

He would have to

21

have a way to get into Federal court.

He would have to

22

have a theory of standing, and I think this is not a

situation that has arisen at this point.

examples of this.

25

There are no

And so I think -­

I thought -- this I'm

confused about.

I would think you would have to have a

2

State which has a law that permits the attorney general

to sue the governor.

Wouldn't you?

4

MS. ANDERS:

If the -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, if the State law is

the attorney general can't sue the governor, that's the

7

end of it, isn't it?

8

Or is it -­

MS. ANDERS:

If that were sufficient to get

into Federal court for Article III purposes.

I think

10

there might be some situations in which the attorney

general -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

Suppose the State law

13

is the governor of the State cannot bring a lawsuit

14

against the attorney general, and vice versa.

15

That's the State law.

16

can either bring a lawsuit on a Federal right in Federal

court?

18

Okay?

Now, under those circumstances,

There may be some circumstances

like that one, in which the State AG's use of Ex parte

would counsel against -­

It has to do with his power as attorney general.

It has nothing to do with -- with Ex parte Young.

Now, suppose I believe that.

Now, do you

lose this case?

6

MS. ANDERS:

No, I don't think so, because

7

the same special sovereignty interests are not present

here, because under the Spending Clause, Virginia had

the choice to opt into this scheme.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Doesn't -- doesn't the

Federal statute say, Virginia, if you want to do this

through a State agency, that State agency has to be an

That's correct, and -­

that, you're a Virginia official and you're -- you know,

22

whatever -- breaking Virginia law, for example?

23

MS. ANDERS:

And -­

Well, under Virginia law, I

24

think that VOPA's officials are subject to for-cause

removal provisions.

So they can actually be removed

VOPA's actions in litigation.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. GETCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

impaired if it is pitted against itself in the courts of

7

another sovereign without its consent.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I would

should not agree to the deal.

12

MR. GETCHELL:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, let's -­
I mean, you know, the

14

Commonwealth had the choice.

15

as counsel for the Government said.

16

turn down the money or, if it's not dignified enough to

17

do that, it could take the money and establish a private

18

organization to do this work instead of a State agency.

19

So, what -- you know, what complaint do you have here?

20

MR. GETCHELL:

It had two choices, as -­
It could either

Well, let me -- let me first

21

say that the choice issue raises some interesting

22

questions because of the procedural posture of this case

23

being an interlocutory appeal.

24

issue of waiver and abrogation, that was litigated

25

below, and no waiver was found, and that wasn't appealed

Because remember, on the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30

against.

2

under a spending statute that the State has taken the

3

money in analyzing the sovereign interest, then we are

4

creating a waiver on the cheap and disheveling the

5

established doctrine.

6

So if we're going to say it makes a difference

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not a waiver; it's

7

-- the Federal statute is clear.

8

can do this in one of two ways.

9

government agency, then that agency has to have

10

It says:

State, you

If you go with a

independence and it has to be able to sue.

11

So if the State is given a choice, it has -­

12

it can do it through private entity; it can do it

13

through, as in this case, an agency that was set up for

14

this very purpose and no other, right?

15

MR. GETCHELL:

I would have thought two

16

things about that.

17

the choice of making it a State agency, it understood

18

that any issues that arise from that would come with the

19

territory.

20

to is it waived its sovereign immunity to be sued, but

21

it did not specify suit in Federal court, and under

22

ordinary doctrine, that's a consent to be sued in its

23

own courts, not in Federal court.

24
25

One is when Congress gave the State

The second thing is what the State consented

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you have a State

which loves litigation.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Forty-eight percent of the

population are retired lawyers.

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Nothing pleases them more

6

than to have everybody suing everybody else.

So they

7

pass a statute which says, for purposes of lawsuits in

8

this State, every department can sue every other

9

department.

10

Now, if you have such a State, what in the

11

Constitution stops the Federal Government from abiding

12

by that rule and applying ordinary Ex parte Young rules,

13

looking at the defendant, looking at horizon, and then,

14

if the plaintiff happens to be a Federal agency suing

15

another, say, well, if it complies with those first set,

16

the fact that A sues B and they're both State agencies,

17

that's the State's decision.

18

can prevent the State from deciding to organize what

19

we'll call the legal heaven way?

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. GETCHELL:

What in the Constitution

I would say two things about

22

that.

23

Congress -- Congress said they had to have a right to

24

sue, and they didn't specify it was Federal court.

25

The first is that that's not what Congress did.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's A.

We can go

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

into A later because I agree that would be an answer, if

2

it's correct -- I mean, if that is what happened.

3

That's a different question, whether Congress could

4

restructure the State.

5

my question was on the first.

6

State from restructuring itself?

7

That's a serious question.

MR. GETCHELL:

But

Can Congress stop the

Well, I -- I don't think the

8

State by restructuring itself would then ordinarily

9

expect its agencies to sue each other in Federal court.

10

In -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

If they wrote it down

12

specifically in the law and said we'd love to have our

13

agencies sue each other.

14

They just say we love to have our agencies sue each

15

other.

16

They don't say Federal court.

They don't mention the court.
MR. GETCHELL:

I would think that, under

17

ordinary rules of waiver of sovereign immunity, that

18

would limit the suits to the suits of the sovereign, the

19

State.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

about allowing the State -­

22

MR. GETCHELL:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

What's undignified

I just -­
-- to live with the choice

it made?
MR. GETCHELL:

I think the existing doctrine

8

entire premise of Ex parte Young is that this doesn't

There's no question
VOPA doesn't

And this is not a direct suit against the

enforcement, prospectively, of a Federal right.
So I don't know why it really matters who

12

the plaintiff is so long as the sovereign interests that

13

we've recognized, that the issue of sovereignty is one

14

that respects a State's coffers and State's laws and

15

16

are going to ensure that, because of the pre-emptive

effect of the Constitution and our laws, that Federal

laws are respected.

19

intrusion on State sovereignty when the State knew and

20

consented consciously to letting VOPA sue for records

21

when it needed to?

22

So what's in this case the

MR. GETCHELL:

In referring to sovereign

23

immunity, I was trying to answer the hypothetical with

24

respect to why Ex parte Young doesn't apply.

part of the question was Congress could expect Ex parte

I'm talking

about Ex parte Young.

11

MR. GETCHELL:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.
I'm imagining -- I'm

13

imagining a system where the State wants to let the AG,

14

this organization, the sheriff of Middlesex County, the

15

City of San Francisco -- they want to permit such

16

entities to become plaintiffs against other parts of the

17

State government in such a State if ordinary Ex parte

18

Young requirements are met.

19

the United States prohibits that suit from going ahead?

20

MR. GETCHELL:

What in the Constitution of

Because Ex parte Young is an

21

exception to the default position.

The default position

22

is that the States at the founding retained all of their

23

natural law-of-nations sovereign immunity.

24

it was -- that it was limited.

25

State; the Federal Government can sue another State; and

We know that

A State can sue another

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

-- can sue a State; and there is the Ex parte Young

2

exception, but it is the exception.

3

It is being extended here.

We know it's

4

being extended here because it's never been done before.

5

And if you're going to extend it, then we ought to ask

6

the question of whether or not -- asking the Hans

7

question.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why is it an

9

extension?

I mean, I have sort of a bit of a problem

10

with that.

Why is it somehow a -- a greater

11

infringement upon State sovereignty to allow a State to

12

be sued in Federal court by a private individual, who

13

doesn't even have to be a Virginian, for Pete's sake -­

14

he could be from anywhere, he could be from Iowa.

15

yet, it somehow offends State sovereignty more when -­

16

when you allow a State agency to sue a State?

17

And

I don't -- I don't see why that's so

18

horribly worse, unless you're arguing that -- that it

19

somehow destroys the State system of separation of

20

powers.

21

answer to that is simply you did it yourself.

22

But that's a different question, and -- and the

MR. GETCHELL:

Well, what I -- what I would

23

say is that Ex parte Young is intended to deal with the

24

situation where a citizen of a dual sovereign is able to

25

vindicate his superior Federal rights against the State.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

That interest is not served one bit by having a State

2

agency sue another State agency in Federal court, even

3

though that State agency could have sued in State court.

4

And I would ask the Hans question.

The Hans

5

question is, would the -- you know, the Constitution is

6

presumed not to raise up causes of action against the

7

States that would have been considered as anomalous and

8

unheard-of at the time of the founding.

9

you posited whether or not at the founding, if you had

And I think if

10

asked, can a part of a State -- well, can the Federal

11

Congress authorize part of a State to sue the other part

12

of the State in Federal court, I think it would have

13

been regarded as anomalous generally.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

When Virginia agreed to

15

participate in this program, did Virginia understand

16

that it could be sued by VOPA not only in -- in the

17

State courts but also in Federal court?

18

MR. GETCHELL:

I would assert not.

I mean,

19

that was the point of the waiver argument below, and the

20

court said there had not been a specific enough

21

declaration of the consequences of taking the money to

22

raise a traditional waiver.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the choice is, if it's

24

not in -- you certainly agree that this State agency has

25

taken on the obligations of the Federal program, and if
Alderson Reporting Company

it doesn't turn over records as the Federal statute

2

requires it to do, it has to be amenable to suit

somewhere.

Federal court.

6

same thing, because Virginia chose to do it that way.

7

Where is it -- where -- a very simple thing, the Federal

8

statute says turn over records to the agency, and the

9

State hospital says no, we're not going to turn over the

So this State agency is doing the exact

10

records.

Where does the agency, whether private or

11

public, that's administering the Federal program go to

12

enforce the Federal right?

13

MR. GETCHELL:

The program would go to State

court.

Virginia has waived its sovereign immunity, and

15

there is a remedy through mandamus.

where there was a rogue attorney general is somebody

would win; the governor would win by getting a

attorney general will win because the political

It isn't that Ex parte

permits one part of a State to sue another part, that

that's common in the State, that the law requires it.

whether or not the State has given independent authority

not the issue in the case.

I think the issue in the

not Ex parte Young should be extended to do something

12

don't think that, as a principle of Federal jurisdiction

-- because, ultimately, whether sovereign immunity

exists, if it's not waived, does deprive this Court -­

I think that deciding we're going to extend

the fiction of Ex parte Young beyond the rights of

bring the State in; we bring a State official who is

MR. GETCHELL:

But this Court has always

recognized that there is a large sense in which that's a

fiction and it's just something that we have to tolerate

2

in order to have a dual system of -- of sovereignty.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So your argument is really

4

-- really is a sovereign immunity argument.

5

saying that the waiver of sovereign immunity, unless it

6

explicitly includes a waiver to be sued in Federal

7

courts, applies only in State courts -- okay -- and that

8

that limitation should not be evaded by applying Ex

10

by another State agency.

11

MR. GETCHELL:

So sovereign immunity is

part of your argument, but -­

It -- well, it's -- I think

it's all that's really appropriately before this Court,

this is good because that's very helpful to me -- the

exact statement that Justice Scalia made, and you said

5

MR. GETCHELL:

And the reason that

One, the State is being

6

pitted against itself.

7

in this case, VOPA sued the State officials in the name

8

of the Commonwealth.

9

If you look at the very caption

Secondly, there's a -- to the extent there's

10

any authority, we have Ex parte Young here that gives

11

rights to citizens, and we have a lot of cases that

12

resulted most recently in Ysursa, in which it was

13

recognized that the general rule is that subordinate

14

parts of States, subordinate State authorities, have no

15

constitutional privileges and immunities that they can

16

assert against their creator.

17

And if you wanted to know whether or not Ex

18

parte Young should be extended into this area, it seems

19

to me that the previous expectation would have been that

20

the Ysursa tradition would have said, no, we don't want

to extend this into this area.
