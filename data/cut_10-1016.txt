of Appeals of Maryland.

Mr. Foreman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. FOREMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FOREMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The propriety of any section 5 legislation

12

is judged by in reference to the historical perspective

13

that it reflects, and that historical perspective is

14

very clear in -- and it's set very clearly by Congress

15

and by this Court.

16

history of State-sponsored gender discrimination.

17

those -- that discrimination embodies gender-based

18

stereotypes that took a very firm hold in the employment

19

area, where women had difficulty obtaining employment

20

and holding employment.

21

cases recognized these gender-based stereotypes as -- as

22

an improper assumption about women's abilities.

23

It -- it is an unfortunate, long
And

And this Court in a litany of

In Frontiero v. Richardson, it rejected this

24

issue that women's mission were to be women -- to be

25

wives and mothers; Stanton v. Stanton, that women were
3

Alderson Reporting Company

2

to be the homemaker and men the breadwinner, and -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Foreman, I guess

3

the question in this case is what this particular

4

statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination

5

and the history of gender discrimination, whether

6

Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination

7

through this provision or whether it was trying to do

8

something else entirely.

9

MR. FOREMAN:

And it was directly attempting

10

to address these gender-based stereotypes in a couple

11

different ways as a practical matter.

12

when an employer saw a woman, they didn't necessarily

13

just see a worker.

14

pregnant, and worked on these gender-based stereotypes,

15

that that woman would either become pregnant, would be

16

disabled because of pregnancy-related disabilities but,

17

in any event, was a least -- least attractive employee.

18

At that time,

They saw a person that could become

And the Family and Medical Leave Act

19

addresses that specifically in its purposes section.

20

specifically says that is intended to promote the equal

21

opportunity for women and men pursuant to the Equal

22

Protection Clause.

23

But more specific to the self-care

24

provision, Congress made it very clear what they were

25

attempting to do.

If you move to the "findings"
4

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

1

section, first, in finding number 6, they address --

2
3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where -- where are

you reading from, counsel?

4

MR. FOREMAN:

I am reading from Appendix A

5

to the brief, and it is -- that employment standards

6

that apply to one gender only have a serious potential

7

for encouraging employers to discriminate against

8

employees and applicants of employment who are of that

9

gender.

10

That's the negative inference argument that

11

we make in our brief.

But even more to the point, if

12

you move to the purpose sections at appendix 2,

13

page appendix 2, it specifically is intended to minimize

14

the potential for employment discrimination on the basis

15

of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for

16

eligible medical reasons, including maternity-related

17

disabilities and for compelling family reasons, and to

18

ensure equal protection under the law.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, following up on

20

Justice Kagan's question, I have -- I have difficulty

21

seeing how providing 12 weeks of leave for self-care for

22

both men and women affects the incentive of an employer

23

who we will assume has an inclination to discriminate

24

against women based on the possibility that a woman

25

applicant for employment may become pregnant.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

I just

Official

1

don't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of

2

an employer in that situation.

3

MR. FOREMAN:

The rationale of Congress at

4

that point was that they could have addressed this issue

5

several different ways.

6

(B), and (C) -- the birth of the child, the adoption of

7

the child, and the Family and Medical Leave Act --

8

against -- again, addressing gender-based stereotypes.

9
10

They -- and they passed (A),

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, (A) is not at issue,

right?

11

Okay.

So, we're just dealing with (D),

12

which concerns a serious health condition.

13

an employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis

14

of gender.

15

employment, a man and a woman, and the employer says,

16

well, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave

17

for a serious medical condition, and if I hire the

18

woman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious

19

medical condition which might be something that either

20

men or women could get, or it also could be a sickness

21

related to pregnancy.

22

So, you have

The employer has two applicants for

So, there still is -- there still would be

23

an incentive for this hypothetical employer to

24

discriminate against the woman.

25

MR. FOREMAN:

But one of the things Congress
6


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

tried to do is to take that incentive away.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

How does it do that?

That's

3

what I'm -- I understand that, and it's a worthy

4

objective.

5

and women 12 weeks of leave for self-care affects the

6

incentive.

7

I just don't understand how giving both men

MR. FOREMAN:

It affects the incentive by

8

providing -- it becomes the equal opportunity employer.

9

It evens the -- the ground.

And the way it would do it

10

is an employer, if you just have (A) through (C), can

11

look at an employee and, based upon gender stereotypes,

12

would make the assumption that the women, because of

13

historically the role they were required to play, would

14

be taking all the leave under (A) and (B) and (C).

15

so, why would I even hire that woman in the first place?

16
17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

But women don't get sick

less often than men, do they?

18

MR. FOREMAN:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, absolutely.
So, you're just adding

20

something to both sides of the balance, and it doesn't

21

affect the employer's incentive.

22

the -- the hypothetical discriminatory employer would

23

still say, well, women are going to be caregivers more

24

often; so, I'm -- I'm going to not hire that person.

25

MR. FOREMAN:

The employer still --

But under (A), (B), and (C)
7


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

after the Family and Medical Leave, an employer would

2

look and say both men can take these now.

3

we need to step back --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I think

And that's why (A), (B), and

5

(C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with

6

it?

7

an approximately equal rate -- maybe you don't assume

8

that -- but if you do, it doesn't seem to factor into

9

the employer's incentives in any way.

If you assume that both men and women get sick at

MR. FOREMAN:

10

There is nothing in the record

11

that demonstrates that there's a differential rate

12

between the self-care rates for men and women.

13

perception was that women, because of pregnancy, because

14

of pregnancy-related disabilities, would in fact take

15

more leave.

16

employer and say she will become pregnant, she will take

17

leave, she will be disabled.

18

the man can take a -- a disability leave on the same

19

basis.

20

But the

And so that I would look at a woman as an

However, with (D) now, but

And the hope of Congress was not that it

21

would happen immediately, but by the -- what would

22

happen is, with the application of family and medical

23

leave, at some point men would be taking (A), (B), and

24

(C), and, in fact, women and men would be taking family

25

and medical self-care leave.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Foreman, I think

2

everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the

3

health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the

4

portions of the Act that this Court upheld, the Congress

5

said there is this close association of women with

6

children; we think it's going to be good for everybody

7

if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly

8

parents, sick children, sick spouse.

9

see the rationale, trying to change the stereotype,

So, we -- we can

trying to open up caregiving for both sexes.

11

But you have answered the question that

12

women and men get sick; there's no -- there's no

13

disproportion.

14

that part of the Act, where there -- there isn't the

15

obvious association of women with childbearing?

16

extend the benefit to men so they'll be associated with

17

child care.

18

So, how do you tie that, just -- just

So, we

There isn't that same link here, is there?
MR. FOREMAN:

I think it is the same linkage

19

trying to address -- it's addressing a difference there,

20

but it's addressing the linkage that women will in fact

21

take pregnancy-based leave or pregnancy-based

22

disabilities and, therefore, are less attractive, less

23

-- employees, and that's what self-care was intended to

24

do.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, you're saying -- let me
9


Alderson Reporting Company

1

just make sure I understand.

2

that Congress is thinking that an employer actually does

3

think that women take more sick leave because women get

4

pregnant.

5

employer who thought women are going to take more family

6

leave, you think Congress was thinking about the

7

employer who thinks women are also going to take more

8

sick leave because of pregnancy?

9

You're saying that the --

And just as Congress was thinking about the

Absolutely, Your Honor.

11

ways of addressing that.

13

There are two separate

14

21

22

negative incentive that only women would take (A), (B),

23

and (C).

24
25

They passed it as a

So, there's two separate ways that this
Court can get to the same conclusion, and that

conclusion is that this is a congruent and proportional

2

response to gender-based discrimination.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you have any evidence

4

that Congress in fact was thinking about either of these

5

two things?

6

suggests either of those two theories?

7

Is there anything in the record that

MR. FOREMAN:

Yes, there -- there is, Your

8

Honor, and let me -- let me take the negative inference

9

first, because I think looking at the statute as a

10

comprehensive makes sense -- is it was introduced -- and

11

I'm reading from page 43.

think the way you judge it is rely on what Congress's

expressed findings and provisions are.

responsive to gender-based discrimination, then how

used to undermine the fact that Congress indeed was

acting pursuant to one of its broadest powers, section 5

13

of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, therefore, that their

14

-- their considered judgment is a congruent and

proportional response.

16

Part of -- part of the findings is clearly

reflective of a fact that this covered both governmental

employers and private industry.

20

colleagues raised repeatedly in their brief.

court -- the Congress needed to do that because they

22

were regulating private employment but, at the same

23

time, recognized to the extent that we are -- are going

24

to regulate State-based conduct.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, there was reference

But the

Well, with respect to the
13


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Commerce Clause, could I ask you this:

2

disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment and hold

3

that it -- that Congress didn't validly abrogate State

4

sovereign immunity with respect to subsection (D), would

5

your client still be able to seek reinstatement or other

6

injunctive relief?

7

MR. FOREMAN:

If we were to

Justice Alito, I think what

8

you're -- and you'll clearly correct me if I am wrong,

9

but I think what you are responding to, is there an Ex

10

parte Young action here that would be made -- able to be

11

made consistent with the Commerce Clause, under the

12

Commerce Clause?

13

And the answer is -- and I know that both

14

Justice Kennedy and Justice Rehnquist, I think, in one

15

of his dissents, pointed out in the Family and Medical

16

Leave Act that the employee may not be left out in the

17

dark because there is an Ex parte Young claim.

18

A couple points on that --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Here the district court

20

completely dismissed your FMLA claim, not just insofar

21

as you sought damages.

22

reinstatement and other equitable relief, but the

23

district court dismissed it completely.

I -- I think you also sought

24

MR. FOREMAN:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's right.
But you're not contesting
14


Alderson Reporting Company

1

that, are you?

2

MR. FOREMAN:

We're not contesting it

3

consistent with any Ex parte Young claim.

What the

4

district court did was say the claim is totally

5

dismissed based upon Eleventh Amendment immunity.

6

But if I could try to respond to your

7

question more specifically, this Court has never as a

8

Court held that Ex parte Young type of action is

9

available in this type of claim.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

damages.

12

MR. FOREMAN:

Pardon?

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because this is for money

14

damages.

Ex parte Young was just injunctive relief.

15

The Eleventh Amendment primarily protects the treasuries

16

of the State against money damages.

17

MR. FOREMAN:

Correct.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. FOREMAN:

It's not Ex parte Young.

Correct.

But as -- as you

20

pointed out in your dissent in Hibbs, that Ex parte

21

Young may be available, but one of the concerns we have

22

is, again, that the Court -- as a majority, the Court

23

has never held that.

24

correct interpretation of the law, that it would be

25

available for injunctive relief.

I believe that is in fact the

However, the Court has

15

Alderson Reporting Company

1

never defined the parameters of what an Ex parte Young

2

action really gives a plaintiff, and that becomes very

3

important in this case.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

You said "in this case."

5

That's basically what I'm asking.

If we were to

6

disagree with you on the Fourteenth Amendment, are you

7

asking us simply -- would we then simply affirm the

8

Fourth Circuit?

9

make some accommodation for the possibility that the

Or would we have to -- would we have to

10

dismissal of your claim, insofar as you sought

11

injunctive relief, may have been improper?

12

MR. FOREMAN:

I think you would have to make

13

that accommodation, but, with respect, Your Honor, I

14

think that would be an incorrect approach.

15

-- here's the reason why in Ex parte Young, a perfect

16

example --

16

Alderson Reporting Company

but did you ask for it?

2

MR. FOREMAN:

In the complaint itself, it

4

Family and Medical Leave Act.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MR. FOREMAN:

7

it yourself.

MR. FOREMAN:

If that's your reading of it,

we will certainly accept your reading.

15

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17
18

Well, you --

You must have asked for

such other and further relief.
MR. FOREMAN:

But, again, back to the Ex

19

parte Young, in the case Nelson v. The University of

20

Tennessee -- Texas, a -- the case that dealt with --

21

exactly with this issue of abrogation of Eleventh

22

Amendment immunity, and they found that there was valid

23

abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity, the State of

24

Texas -- then the court was required to address the Ex

25

parte Young issue.

And the State of Texas argued that
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reinstatement is not an appropriate remedy under Ex

2

parte Young and that -- while the Fifth Circuit

3

ultimately rejected that, that is an argument that

4

employees would have to face:

5

of Ex parte Young?

6

the remedy that Congress in their considered judgment

7

believed was the appropriate remedy to address

8

gender-based discrimination.

9

What are the parameters

And, more importantly, that is not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, Congress must have

10

thought that giving the woman back her job was an

11

important part.

12

wasn't supposed to be fired.

13

the relief, the non-monetary relief, is certainly

14

important.

I mean, I thought the whole idea is she

MR. FOREMAN:

15

So, I think that the --

It is extremely important, but

16

Congress did not stop there.

17

to take one step further and there needed to be monetary

18

relief.

19

exactly why.

20

Congress decided it needed

And I think Mr. Coleman's case illustrates

Here Mr. Coleman exercised his rights that

21

were supposedly guaranteed him under the Family and

22

Medical Leave Act, and indeed under a State law, and the

23

State of Maryland fired him, and he is out of work.

24

what is the disincentive for the State to not do the

25

same thing the next time if the only thing that you can
18

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

get is possibly injunctive relief prohibiting them from

2

doing that in the future and maybe reinstatement 2 or 3

3

years down the line?

Employees at that point cannot put

4

their lives on hold.

They have a duty to go out and try

5

to mitigate, try to find another job.

6

What's an employer to do?

And Congress said

7

there needs to be more.

We passed Title VII to try to

8

address gender-based discrimination, the Pregnancy

9

Discrimination Act, but there were still voids.

And the

10

Family and Medical Leave Act attempts to fill those

11

voids, and one of those voids is try to provide a

12

monetary incentive so that the State of Maryland and

13

private employers will in fact comply with the law.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you -- when you --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I go -- I'm sorry.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you say you're

17

concerned about a disincentive to hire women, but the

18

Pregnancy Discrimination Act makes that unlawful.

19

if an employer decides I don't want to hire women of

20

child-bearing age, that is an out-and-out violation of

That is, Your Honor, but the

4

5

pregnancy.

The law protects the woman of child-

It -- well, what the Pregnancy

Discrimination Act provided was that you needed to treat

give them medical leave, to everyone, because otherwise

15

the employer won't hire women.

question I'm asking is, you are assuming that the

employer will break the law by refusing to hire women

He won't hire -- we have to

because they wanted to eliminate or at least reduce one

MR. FOREMAN:

Yes.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

discrimination was refusing to hire women of child-

because that would be a violation of the law.

So, is

11

MR. FOREMAN:

I -- I don't think that was

12

Congress's intent, and that that's not what was

13

reflected.

14

it on two separate levels:

15

discrimination, the gender stereotype that women simply

16

become less attractive; and in the broader statute, to

17

prevent the negative inference so that all -- that

18

ultimately where we would get in society is the ability

19

to take pregnancy-related leave, other leave, would not

20

be viewed as a negative inference running against women,

nonissue.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

1

Howard, for a second, as I took from Mr. Foreman

2

something that I hadn't understood from his briefs --

3

maybe I just missed it -- which is that he's making a

4

kind of analogous argument, that, just as in the -- in

5

the prior provisions of the Act, employers thought of

6

women as caregivers and the response of Congress was to

7

provide a gender-neutral leave benefit that had both --

8

that both women and men were eligible for.

9

So here, employers think of women as needing

10

more medical leave because of pregnancy, and the

11

response of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick

12

leave.

13

So, what is your response to that argument?
MR. HOWARD:

Congress, Justice Kagan, did

14

not I think take that stereotype or perception that Mr.

15

Foreman referred to into account.

16

point the Court to page 21 of our brief, where we cite

17

some Bureau of Labor Statistics studies indicating that

18

men and women at the time took roughly the same amount

19

of sick leave.

20

much.

21

will take roughly the same amount of time after the

22

enactment of the FMLA --

23

And I'd specifically

In fact, Mr. Foreman has conceded as

And that same study projects that men and women

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But there certainly

24

was -- there was certainly much conversation and

25

testimony that, whether they in fact took the same
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

amount of leave time or not, that women who were

2

pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting

3

pregnant were hired less frequently because,

4

subjectively, the employers thought that they were more

5

likely to take the time.

6

So, frankly, for years there was questions

7

about whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring

8

young women because they feared they would leave in the

9

middle of a big case or something else.

We all know

10

those stories.

11

many ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to

12

that.

13

So, it is sort of common knowledge in

So, assume that that was Congress's

14

perception, because it was supported by the record or as

15

much of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate.

16

Where does that leave your argument?

17

MR. HOWARD:

Well, I would make a couple of

18

points in response to that, Justice Sotomayor.

19

the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was already in place.

20

And so, to the extent there were perceptions that

21

employers might discriminate based on pregnancy

22

disabilities, that would be unlawful under Title VII as

23

amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

24
25

First,

And the fact that -- and you are quite right
that there is a fair amount of discussion in the
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

legislative record, although I think it's less of a

2

predominant theme than the concern for job security for

3

working families, but there certainly is discussion

4

about pregnancy discrimination and pregnancy disability

5

as a type of illness.

6

But we again would note that this is valid

7

Commerce Clause legislation.

8

kind of discrimination was occurring and leave was being

9

denied or women were suffering adverse consequences in

10

the workplace as a result of pregnancy discrimination,

11

they could enforce the 12 weeks through a Title VII

12

action.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so, to the extent that

They couldn't -- the

14

Pregnancy Discrimination Act says that you have to treat

15

pregnancy like any other disability.

16

giving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have

17

to give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day.

18

what -- that's the gap that this legislation fills.

19

says, yes, you do have to provide leave for women who

20

have disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then

21

you have to give that to men as well.

22

that for the one sex.

23

Pregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was

24

referring to.

25

So, if they're not

And that's
It

You can't reserve

So, it was the gap in the

MR. HOWARD:

Yes, I agree, Justice Ginsburg,
25

1

but the gap that existed was the absence of a guaranteed

2

period of leave.

3

a substantive entitlement, and so -- to a certain amount

4

of leave.

5

served as prophylaxis for Title VII but not for

6

constitutional violations.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

In other words, it was the absence of

And, in effect, the gap that was being filled

Now -Assume for the sake of

8

argument that for the -- the applicants for particular

9

provisions -- particular positions, I should say --

10

where the applicants are typically of a certain age, men

11

tend to take less sick leave than women, because women

12

also take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses.

13

So, giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the -- the

14

possibility that women -- women who will be -- want to

15

take additional -- will want to take more sick leave

16

will be fired because they exceed the amount of sick

17

leave allowed by the employer for everybody.

18

that connected to eliminating discrimination in

19

employment?

20

MR. HOWARD:

Now, isn't

Justice Alito, I think that one

could argue that that is connected with eliminating

MR. HOWARD:

That would certainly be part of

the answer, and what I was going to say was that what

you are describing is a disproportionate impact on women

20

as a result of assumptions concerning pregnancy

21

disability.

this kind of conduct or if there were a disproportionate

impact, that would not state an equal protection

medical leave.

to what Justice Alito just said, is when -- you have to

there is very different.

It becomes --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The idea is it's part of

24

one package.

I think that's what Justice Breyer was

25

getting at.

But just suppose that Congress wanted to
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

improve conditions for the -- in the job market for

2

women, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating

3

force behind this Act, and they also wanted to protect

4

families so that sick children, sick spouses are

5

attended to.

6

Now, what leave policy would say, okay, to

7

do that, we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a

8

child is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker

9

herself is sick?

Without -- it's all part of one

10

package which is designed to increase job security for

11

women and increase protection for their families.

12

don't think you can slice off (D) from the other three.

13

MR. HOWARD:

So, I

Justice Ginsburg, I think you

14

can separate (D) on the same analysis that this Court

15

applied in Tennessee v. Lane, in contrast to the Garrett

16

case.

17

same Antidiscrimination Act required different

18

analysis -- analyses and reference to different parts of

19

the record.

20

prevent discrimination against persons with

21

disabilities, but the operation and effect of the

22

particular claim requires a different analysis.

23

Justice Stevens said, the Court is not required to

24

evaluate statutes as an undifferentiated whole.

25

In Lane, of course, different sections of the

There was a single over-arching purpose, to

JUSTICE BREYER:

As

course.

But the whole point of the question that I was

2

asking was, sure, what helps you by doing it separately

3

is it helps your case.

4

was trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole.

5

That's my point that I want you to answer.

6

trying to do it as a whole because, no matter what

numbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)?

Yes, (D).

But if we look at what Congress

12

over hiring a man -- it goes way down.

13

women.

And that helps

14

And that is why, I think -- reading this and

15

listening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of

16

the other, because working with that 12-week limitation

17

and the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute

18

that doesn't defeat itself.

19

actually can achieve the end of leading employers to not

20

discriminate against women.

21

a big improvement.

22

We now have a statute that

Not perfectly, but there's

And that's the -- that's the argument I'm

23

making.

You have to read it as a whole to see that.

24

And that's what I -- I wonder if there's an answer to

25

that.

Of course, I'm at the moment thinking there isn't
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an answer to it, but I asked the question because I want

2

to hear what you say.

3

MR. HOWARD:

Well, with respect to the

4

ratio, I think the premise of that point is that women

5

will take more leave for serious health conditions than

6

men.

7

know, Mr. Foreman has recognized as much.

8

think the ratio really changes.

9

And I don't think that's borne out.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And, you
So, I don't

Well, what if Congress had

10

added three additional subsections here and said that an

11

employer has to provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave so that

12

an employee can go to a health spa, 12 weeks of unpaid

13

leave for -- so that the employee can travel, 12 weeks

14

of unpaid leave so that the employee can take an

15

educational course?

16

Now, that -- those could be taken advantage

17

of by either men and women.

It makes both men and women

18

increasingly unattractive as employees and, therefore,

19

reduces the any special disincentive that might have

20

been created by (A), (B), and (C).

21

Now, on that same logic, would those be --

22

would those be provisions that further the elimination

23

of discrimination based on gender?

24
25

MR. HOWARD:

I -- I think even if one

accepted the premise, and we don't, that women take more
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

leave for health conditions, that would further dilute

2

the ratio, to have available all those types of leave.

19

interested in what you think.

20

MR. HOWARD:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I'm working from a

22

different proposition than you are in response to this

23

question.

24

that men and women take is relevant.

25

What is the employer's perception, and did Congress have

I don't think that the actual amount of time

34

Alderson Reporting Company

The question is:

Official

1

a valid basis, as Justice Kagan pointed out earlier, to

2

believe that employers thought women took more time?

3

MR. HOWARD:

I -- I think that if -- even if

4

that were correct, and -- and I don't think it is

5

because I think the overwhelming themes in the

6

legislative record as a whole really were a concern for

7

working families, whether single-income, double-income,

8

and the concern that if a breadwinner falls ill, the

9

family's going to have severe financial insecurity.

10

then there was also concern against discrimination

11

against persons with illness.

12

But I think that one thing I'd like to

13

emphasize is that your -- your suggestion, Justice

14

Sotomayor, and -- and really almost all of the

15

discussion here today, I think, explains why this is

16

good social policy.

17

that we've really gotten anywhere near the necessary

18

predicate of unconstitutional State conduct when the

19

constitutional right is defined with some precision.

20

We support it.

And

But I don't think

And I -- and I think one has to define this

21

right as -- as disability.

And I think also the

22

protections that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act

24

to the substantive entitlement, as a matter of Commerce

5

and I think we're here mainly on -- we need to defend

6

this on principle.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, Mr. Howard, I -- I do

23

think that the point about the package is that if you

24

look at (D) alone, when you abstract it from everything

25

else, you have a good point, that it seems to be related
37

1

to economic security, which is not a section 5 issue;

2

that it seems to be related to discrimination against

3

sick people, which would also put us in a different

4

legal universe.

5

But when you look at (D) as passed at the

6

same moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B),

7

and (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being

8

to protect women from discrimination in the workplace

9

because of unfair stereotypical -- views about what

10

women do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind

11

of aura.

12

And you can talk about a number of theories

13

for that, but I guess I would just ask for your -- your

14

reaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package

15

which was about telling employers:

16

stereotypes.

MR. HOWARD:

Employ

Well, I -- I would respond in

part -- and I'm going to accept your proposition that I

20

should discuss these provisions as part of a single

21

package.

22

(D) provides a separate claim, a separate basis to sue

23

States, and we think that claim is incongruent and

24

disproportionate to any conceivable unconstitutional

25

conduct that it might prohibit.

But from the standpoint of States, subsection

health condition.

10

But -- but

So, I -- I would really emphasize, in

11

response to your question, that one could look at it as

12

a package, but from the standpoint of States, it's a

13

separate and independent claim, and it's an

14

extraordinarily broad one.

15

simply because Pregnancy Discrimination Act claims are

16

available, but, Justice Alito, there are Ex parte Young

17

claims available.

18

And it is not necessary, not

In -- in response to your question, in this

19

case at the Joint Appendix pages 3 to 12, the amended

20

complaint reveals that injunctive relief was sought,

21

albeit -- and on page 12 is the prayer for relief.

22

It's -- it's not clear whether that relief is sought

23

under Title VII or FMLA or both.

don't think -- the claim fails separate and apart from

25

any sovereign immunity argument.

But the reason why I

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's some focus in

the legislative history particularly on the -- the

5

woman, not a man -- and the devastating impact on that

6

family of the woman getting sick, the sole breadwinner

getting sick.
