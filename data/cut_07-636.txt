ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. FURLOW

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. FURLOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

As this Court has confined consideration of

12

the matters before the Court to certiorari issue number

13

5 concerning qualified domestic relations orders, or

14

QDROs as they are called, I will confine my argument to

15

arguing that the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that the

16

only way a divorcing spouse can waive the right to

17

pension benefits is by executing a QDRO.

18

basic arguments to present today.

19

thumbnail sketch form first.

20
21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I have four

I'll give them in

You did in your reply

brief address the plan question?
MR. FURLOW:

Yes, Your Honor.

I did so

23

after stating that we believe that the matter was

24

properly confined to the certiorari issue number three,

25

but out of an abundance of caution and subject to
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

objection I did respond to the argument leveled against

2

us by I think it is five amici and by DuPont itself.

3

nevertheless, I prepared my original briefing on the

4

merits to address the QDRO issue and that's where you

5

see it focused.

6

We

We have four basic issues.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The problem is that is

7

that if you, even if we hold for you on that issue, you

8

could still lose on the plan documents rule, right.

9

MR. FURLOW:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

10

instead this Court might choose well to follow what the

11

concurrence said in the recent LaRue v. DeWolff, Boberg

12

case, emphasizing that where the court of appeals below

13

has not passed on the central issue of a case and where

14

most of the fire that the one party is responding to

15

comes from amici, that it is appropriate to remand the

16

case to that court so that that court may pass on the

17

central issue, especially in the situation where, as

18

here, the Fifth Circuit did not even mention the plan

19

document's role, but based its decision solely on a

20

misinterpretation of the QDRO language.

21

Of course, here, in the interest of candor,

22

Dupont did in fact address in brief format -- a page or

23

to, several pages -- in its motion for summary judgment

24

the plan document's role and raised that matter again in

25

the Fifth Circuit.

It's just the Fifth Circuit did not
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consider or pass on that because it relied solely on

2

Dupont's argument that the Fifth Circuit should adhere

3

to what it believed to be the Department of Treasury's

4

interpretation of the anti-alienation statute.

5

Department of the Treasury and the Department of Labor,

6

now in a harmonized stance, have come forth and in their

7

amicus for the government supports our position that the

8

Fifth Circuit erred in its interpretation of the QDRO

9

statute, and that's the position we take.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

At the end of your

11

argument, could you just spend a minute because my state

12

of mind is I'm sorry we limited it.

13

briefed this question pretty fully.

14

MR. FURLOW:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

You've sort of

Yes, Your Honor.
And I'm tempted to try to

16

decide it.

17

Go right ahead.

18

why shouldn't we just go ahead and decide the substance,

19

not as a technical matter.

20

something out of remanding it that we don't already

21

know?

22

I know you want to make your four points.
But at the end, could you possibly say,

Are we really going to get

But don't do that now, but whenever you want.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

We know what's going to

23

happen on remand, though, don't we?

24

Circuit already have case law on -- on that question?

25

MR. FURLOW:

Doesn't the Fifth

The Fifth Circuit already has

1

case law.

2

of the other cases and they might consider this Court's

3

ruling addressing the interpretation of the QDRO

4

provision; that might provide them additional

5

enlightenment as to how they should address the

6

other issue.

7

They have stated that, but they consider some

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But again as a preliminary

8

matter, am I on the same page with Justice Ginsburg?

9

would it be a different question?

Or

I'm curious to know

10

why the beneficiary designation and change provisions at

11

page 48, number 29c, beneficiaries, couldn't have been

12

invoked here.

13

Ginsburg was asking?

14
15
16

Is that the same question Justice

MR. FURLOW:

I do not believe so, Justice

Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because the plan does

17

contain a procedure for designating some other

18

beneficiary, including the spouse.

19

understand why anybody doesn't talk about that.

20

MR. FURLOW:

I just don't

Well, Your Honor, there was

21

that provision for invoking another beneficiary and we

22

only pointed out that indeed three days after the

23

divorce, and consistent with his ex-wife's waiver of any

24

right, title, claim and interest in this 401(k) plan in

25

specific, and that was the very first item of the things
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that he retained as the plan participant in that divorce

2

decree, he did in fact designate his sole daughter Kari

3

Kennedy as his sole beneficiary in a change of form plan

4

for one part of this very complex series of multiple

5

plans -- of plan retirement benefits where he said that

6

he would give -- that she would be his sole beneficiary;

7

and the form there that DuPont drafted for him said that

8

it invoked and superseded any and all prior

9

designations, and was not limited to that one particular

10

part 6 pension and retirements plan.

11

it is a reasonable explanation, if he did not believe

12

that his wife had waived any right, title and interest

13

to invoke that beneficiary clause, pursuant to the Fifth

14

Circuit's decision just six weeks beforehand in the

15

Brandon v Travelers International case that said that a

16

waiver of ERISA benefits, welfare benefits mainly -- but

17

ERISA waiver of benefits, a voluntary waiver was

18

enforceable, was valid and could be enforced at summary

19

judgment.

20

And so we submit

We believe his counsel, you know, were aware

21

of that in formulating, you know, this waiver of

22

benefits.

23

Kennedy's knowing, voluntary, attorney-negotiated,

24

court-approved, signed-by-her waiver of any right,

25

title, claim and interest in his pension benefits, then

Even if that didn't take care of Liv

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we believe he may have believed as a layman that by

2

signing that beneficiary designation form prepared by

3

DuPont, that he had indeed superseded and revoked all

4

prior designations.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Or he might have -- he

6

might have decided that he didn't want to revoke that

7

one.

8

that he revoked as to one plan but not the 501(k) plan,

9

as I understand.

We -- we just have no way of knowing.

10

MR. FURLOW:

It's odd

Your Honor, I might -- I might,

11

if I would, just offer an explanation.

12

certainly saw no reason to revoke that which his wife

13

had just four days before voluntarily waived any right,

14

title, claim and interest to in terms of the divorce.

15

He certainly would have expected that her word would be

16

her bond and that it wouldn't turn out to be a junk bond

17

as it turned out to be when years later she repudiated

18

her own voluntary waiver; and that's just one of the

19

issues that we address.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He almost

Well, because he could -

21

he could have -- despite her waiver, he could have named

22

her as the beneficiary of that plan and that would have

23

controlled.

24
25

MR. FURLOW:

Well, Your Honor, the way I see

it is that his attorneys who were advising him and
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

guiding him through this process, they were acting, we

2

must assume, in complete awareness of Texas and Fifth

3

Circuit law; and the Fifth Circuit had just ruled some

4

six weeks before in a case involving voluntary divorce

5

decree waivers that such a waiver was enforceable.

6

you don't have to -

7
8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now

I'm sorry; six weeks

before what?
MR. FURLOW:

Before the divorce decree in

10

the Brandon v. Travelers International case.

11

that there was no sense there in bombing the rubble.

12

it was already taken care of, it didn't have to be taken

13

care of the second time.

14

belt-and-suspenders approach to be absolutely, doubly,

15

positively sure.

16

Federal common law, as a majority of courts and almost

17

all of the State courts have ruled, a voluntary waiver

18

is enforceable, then that was already taken care of.

19
20
21

We believe
If

Now, I and you might want a

But the fundamental thing is if under

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but how does

the plan know that?
MR. FURLOW:

The plan knows that, as here,

22

when the court-appointed fiduciary, the executrix Kari

23

Kennedy makes the plan aware of that on April 26, 2001,

24

via fax and delivery, which is acknowledged by their

25

plan administrator, Mary Deneen that's coming in, and
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there you have a copy of the divorce decree served on

2

DuPont months before they make a payout.

3

And it is critical here, Your Honor, that

4

when they chose to make this -- you know, when they

5

chose to pay the beneficiary, they were working on a

6

test case right there from the very beginning.

7

you look at their paralegal's letter, who actually

8

notifies the estate that they are going to disregard the

9

voluntary test case, they refer to DuPont's success in

And if

10

raising this issue before.

11

actually quotes a Fifth Circuit case that holds for

12

voluntary waivers, obviously not understanding the, you

13

know, crucial import here; and we note -

14

And then the paralegal

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the plan terms

15

say that if you want to change the beneficiary, here's

16

how you've got to change the beneficiary; and we are

17

going to pay the beneficiary until it's changed.

18

MR. FURLOW:

Well, Your Honor, I would also

19

say that the plan forms here at page 48 of your joint

20

appendix, and 49 -- I ask this Court to scrutinize these

21

two provisions because they are critical to the outcome

22

of the case.

23

mandatory language in DuPont's own SIP.

24

"If no surviving spouse exists and no beneficiary

25

designation is in effect, distribution shall" -

At page 48 you hear the following

10
Alderson Reporting Company

And it says:

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mandatory term -- "shall be made to or in accordance

2

with the directions of the executor or administrator of

3

the decedent's estate."

4

And so we say that -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

5

your friend on the other side would be quoting that

6

language.

7

MR. FURLOW:

Well, Your Honor, I like to

8

bring a fresh insight to the -- to the -- to the

9

Petitioner's argument here because I see that language

10

and we say it is not in effect.

11

several cases what the term "in effect" means, and in

12

ERISA cases saying this version of ERISA was in effect,

13

meaning valid and operational.

14

waiver was in effect and that made the beneficiary

15

designation some 10 years before during the course of

16

the marriage ineffectual, invalid.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

a bit of a stretch, isn't it?

19

designation is in effect.

20

got a beneficiary designation.

21

MR. FURLOW:

This Court has ruled in

Well, the voluntary

And so But that's -- that's

It says no beneficiary

If you look at the plan, he's

But it's not in effect at the

22

time that it comes to be decided because their plan

23

administrator Mary Deneen has a copy of the divorce

24

decree with the knowing voluntary waiver.

25

Your Honor, although they take the position that plan
11
Alderson Reporting Company

And although,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

administrators can't understand knowing and voluntary

2

waivers, that that's a law sort of thing, they have got

3

one in-house counsel there who was never called upon to

4

actually pass on this matter and it wouldn't have cost

5

them a dime to go outside of that in-house counsel.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, that was

7

the point of my earlier point.

8

whole paragraph.

9
10

MR. FURLOW:

I focused on -- on this

Yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That just indicates that

11

this would have been a different case if the provision

12

of the plan that said there shall be no assignment,

13

which is quoted in the Fifth Circuit thing, was the only

14

provision in the plan; but when you look through this in

15

retrospect, there are means for participants and

16

beneficiaries to make a change, and they weren't

17

followed here.

18

MR. FURLOW:

Well -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I understand that you

20

say in effect they were.

21

it's not as if the plan didn't contain an adequate

22

vehicle if the -- the parties had followed strictly the

23

terms of the plan.

24
25

MR. FURLOW:

I understand that argument but

Your Honor, we submit that

people all the time in situations like this may believe
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that a knowing voluntary waiver which has received the

2

approval of the majority of the Federal appellate courts

3

and the State courts is good enough.

4

instances, they forget.

5

make those changes, or believe that one of a series of

6

multiple and overlapping beneficiary designations has -

7

as the June 7th one did, we submit -- revoked and

8

superseded any and all prior designations, and they are

9

lay people not lawyers.

10

In some other

They forget to do this or to

Now, I would submit that the critical thing

11

is also on page 49 the very portion of the joint

12

appendix that you're looking at, because that language

13

says, in the DuPont SIP plan, quote, "if in the opinion

14

of the company there is a question as to the legal right

15

of any beneficiary to receive a distribution under the

16

plan, the amount in question may be paid to the

17

decedent's estate in which event the trustee and the

18

company shall have no further liability to anyone in

19

respect to such amounts."

20

heard all of the fear mongering that's come in, in the

21

amici briefs with respect to -- to interpleader actions.

22

And we submit that interpleader actions are a perfectly

23

good means of disposing of this, but if you -

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

of the company.

Consider that when you've

It's in the opinion

That sounds -- and this is a plan -- as
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we've said often in ERISA cases, we want to enforce

2

these according to the terms of the plan because the

3

companies don't have to set these up at all.

4

makes perfect sense for the company to say, well, if we

5

think this, then we can do this.

6

there's a doubt and we don't want to give it to somebody

7

who might not end up being the person, but if we don't

8

think there's a doubt, that's it.

9

MR. FURLOW:

So it

So, in other words,

And that's the first step in

10

the analysis, Your Honor, because the second step is all

11

of this Supreme Court case and all of the substantial

12

expenses that this estate out of Jasper, Texas, has had

13

to pay from the very beginning could have been avoided

14

had they paid over to Kari Kennedy, a court-appointed

15

executrix who would have taken that money in and would

16

have been bound by the rules of the probate court to

17

handle it as a fiduciary to consider Liv's claim that

18

her voluntary waiver was not voluntary, to pay the

19

creditors first, rather than get stuck with the past

20

liabilities, which happened here.

21

The important thing is DuPont could have

22

avoided all of this litigation, would not have had to

23

file an interpleader, would not have had to incur a

24

dime's worth of attorney's fees, would not have had to

25

put its own interest ahead of that of the participants
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and beneficiaries, had they simply invoked this clause

2

as they had the power to do.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They chose this case.
We can't decide this case

4

based on sympathy to DuPont.

5

point of your argument.

6

would be exactly the same, whether DuPont had expressed

7

a doubt and paid it into the estate or hadn't.

But if -- in theory the problem

8

MR. FURLOW:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

I would understand the

The problem We have the same question

before us.

11

MR. FURLOW:

The QDRO question, Your Honor?

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. FURLOW:

Yes.

Yes, and that's why we say that

14

if you look carefully at -- excuse me, but it's 29

15

U.S.C. section 1056(b) through (k) -- you look at the

16

specific language, and I am asking this Court to adhere

17

to the specific written terms of the ERISA statute

18

because those require a transfer to an alternate payee.

19

That is our fundamental argument:

20

alternate payee which is defined in 1056(d)(3)(K) as

21

being someone -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

somewhere in the materials?

24
25

MR. FURLOW:

A transfer to an

Sorry.

Does this appear

It's always helpful.

Respondents' brief, Your Honor,

and you will find it specifically on pages 14A and 15A,
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the appendix in the back.

2

the language, we stand on a plain-meaning interpretation

3

of the ERISA statute, this reticulated and complicated

4

statute.

5
6

And if you actually go to

We say every word has its meaning.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What do you want me to

read here?

7

MR. FURLOW:

Specifically, Your Honors,

8

pages 14A and 15A of the Respondents' appendix, where he

9

has actually given us all of the QDRO statute at 1056.

10

And we say that has meaning, and that means

11

we prevail because, if you look at that language, every

12

subpart is talking about payments to alternate payees.

13

"Alternate payees" are defined at 1056(d)(3)(K), and you

14

will find that, Your Honors, specifically at page, at

15

page 22A to 23A in the appendix.

16

The alternate payees there that we are

17

talking about are spouse, ex-spouse, child, or other

18

dependent.

19

Mr. Kennedy; and, therefore, there was no -- his mere

20

retention of his pension benefits and his wife's waiver

21

of her contingent beneficiary payments, which would only

22

come to her upon the death of William Kennedy, meant

23

there was no transfer, not a dime's worth of money, not

24

a bit of pension benefits transferred on the date that

25

she signed that waiver.

It does not refer to the plan participant

There was thus no 16

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm not sure I'm getting

2

this argument.

There's not -- the argument isn't that

3

there was a QDRO; the argument was that he could have

4

disposed of this through a QDRO.

5

that, and he could have named an alternate payee in the

6

QDRO.

And he could have done

He could have named his daughter, for example.

7

MR. FURLOW:

Your Honor, the way pension

8

planners understand it is that you use a QDRO for a

9

transfer of benefits, not for a bare waiver.

And that's

10

where the U.S. Solicitor General supports our position

11

and reads this and says that's consistent with

12

Treasury's own, now harmonized with Labor's,

13

interpretation of the anti-alienation clause.

14

not apply to bare waivers of benefits, and, therefore,

15

the Fifth Circuit erred in putting within a QDRO context

16

his wife's -

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

It does

All you're saying is that

18

you couldn't effect a bare waiver through a QDRO, but

19

why does that prove your case?

20

MR. FURLOW:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't understand that.

We think that A QDRO could have been used

22

to direct the payment to someone else other than the

23

ex-spouse.

24
25

MR. FURLOW:

With respect to her waiver that

would have required him in advance to decide who he
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have transferred what alternate payee he would

2

transfer way back at the time of his divorce in 1994.

3

He cannot.

4

She didn't receive anything at that time.

5

waived her contingent right to receive something upon

6

her death, something that would occur in the future.

7

She thoroughly waived that.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10

He did not transfer anything to his wife.
She simply

That's not your point.

It

would seem to me your point is that the QDRO is an
exception to the assignment or alienation.

11

MR. FURLOW:

I believe -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And your point is this has

13

been no assignment or agency, so we don't need the QDRO

14

exception.

15

anything in the statute.

16
17

There is nothing in here that violates

MR. FURLOW:

I completely agree with that

analysis.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

done a QDRO is in your view irrelevant.

20

is the QDRO is an exception from the prohibition on

21

assignment or alienation, that provision has no

22

application here, there has been no assignment or

23

alienation, and therefore the waiver is effective.

24

So we find support in that and we find

support in not only Treasury's interpretation of its own

2

regulation, which deserves great deference under this

3

Court's opinion, especially when DuPont in the Fifth

4

Circuit asserted that it was Department of Treasury that

5

had all of the expertise pursuant to congressional

6

mandate in determining how QDROs should apply and told

7

the Fifth Circuit to follow their outdated

8

interpretation of the QDRO statute.

9

not in a position to say that the expertise that they

They certainly are

10

touted in the Fifth Circuit should be disregarded now,

11

and we submit that the Attorney General and the

12

Solicitor General are correct in saying that the

13

regulation does not mean what DuPont says it does, but

14

means what Kennedy says it does.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, of course you

only think the Solicitor General is right so far to a

certain extent.

MR. FURLOW:

To a certain extent.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Then you throw them

think they are correct by saying, look, the only way you

can do this is by modifying the plan.

But we are

that's not a matter for the plan to worry about.

11

MR. FURLOW:

Well, Your Honor, let me

12

address that.

First, we don't throw the Solicitor

13

General under the tracks.

14

that they have gone off track in terms of their plan

15

documents.

16

agree with the Manning versus, the Manning decision of

17

the Texas, of the Fifth Circuit, which we cited.

18

there that says that sections 1102 and 1104 of ERISA are

19

a very thin reed indeed to on which to cobble together a

20

plan document's rule.

21

one bridge too far going way beyond that to say that

22

these ever meetable ever changeable beneficiary changes

23

thousands of them constitute documents where the Ninth

24

Circuit conity substitutes of what constitutes plan

25

documents in the salaried employees of Hughes versus

We simply point out the fact

And specifically, Your Honor, I would say I

In

And specifically DuPont then goes

Hughes administrator case and said that a list of the

2

participants and their addresses could not be considered

3

a plan document because it did not correspond with that

4

detailed listing of the plan document under Section 1024

5

and 102 a.

6

these are plan documents then the administrator has a

7

duty to disclose them to any person participant or

8

beneficiary who asked and as the Ninth Circuit pointed

9

out there is substantial dangers there of going way

Indeed under Section 1025, Your Honors, if

10

beyond what Congress, a very liberal Watergate Congress

11

in 1974, intended ERISA to be, which is a protection for

12

participants and beneficiaries, not for plan

13

administrators.

14

beneficiaries to loss of privacy, telemarketing, and

15

other things because one person could get such a list

16

and sell it to others.

And it exposes those participants and

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LEONDRA R. KRUGER

6

ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE

7
8

I would

Thank you, counsel.

Kruger.

MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

The Fifth Circuit decided this case on the

10

grounds that ERISA's anti-alienation provision forbids a

11

divorcing spouse from relinquishing an interest in his

12

or her ex-spouse's pension plan benefits unless the

13

waiver takes the form of a qualified domestic relations

14

order.

15

We agree with Petitioner that the Fifth

16

Circuit misinterpreted both the anti-alienation

17

provision and the QDRO exception to that provision.

18

we disagree with Petitioner's further submission that

19

merely because ERISA does not forbid waivers in the

20

divorce context or otherwise, that a plan administrator

21

may be required as a matter of Federal common law to

22

recognize such waivers even when those waivers conflict

23

with the beneficiary designation the plan administrator

24

has on file.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

Well, are the provisions

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of page 49 of the appendix consistent with the statute?

2

MS. KRUGER:

Indeed, Your Honor, we think

3

that they are.

4

to administer the plan in accordance with the plan

5

documents and further requires administrators to pay

6

benefits to persons who are either participants under

7

the plan or who are beneficiaries within the meaning of

8

the statute.

9
10

The statute directs plan administrators

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did the Court of Appeals

give short shrift or overlook that point?

11

MS. KRUGER:

Well, the Court of Appeals

12

determined that it need not reach this point because it

13

decided the case on different grounds; namely, the

14

anti-alienation grounds.

15

the Fifth Circuit was incorrect in its reasoning but

16

reached the correct overall conclusion, then its

17

judgment should be affirmed.

18

But, again, we think that if

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we -- I mean, we

19

could have -- you know, we should have thought of that

20

when we limited our -- our grant of certiorari to the -

21

to the one question on which you agree with the

22

Petitioner.

23

the other one was -- was explicitly put under our nose,

24

and we said we -- we are not going to get into that?

25

just want to decide this question, which is an important

But we did do that, didn't we, even though

23
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question all by itself.

2

MS. KRUGER:

Well, for several reasons, Your

3

Honor, we think it would be appropriate for the Court to

4

answer both the plan documents question as well as the

5

anti-alienation question.

6
7

One is that it is an alternative ground for
affirmance.

8
9
10

The other is that it was properly raised in
the Court of Appeals.

It was raised in the cert

petition as well as in the brief in opposition.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you know any other case

12

in which we have explicitly declined to accept a

13

question and then have used one of these other back

14

doorways of -- of answering it anyway?

15

MS. KRUGER:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

I don't know of any.

I'm -- I'm not sure that I know

of any either, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, could we do this?

I

21

mean, what's bothering me about this is -- is you have a

22

very strong argument following the plan documents.

23

have had some chance to reply to it, but not a full

24

chance.

25

had -- would probably know what they say.

They

It seems a little unfair, and the Fifth Circuit

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Okay.

Can

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we, say, grant the question now and ask that people file

2

an additional brief if they want to say something?

3

It just seems to me an awful waste of money

4

and everybody's time to send it back and have it make

5

another trip.

6

proceed?

7

So what's your suggestion as to how we

MS. KRUGER:

Well, Your Honor, I think it

8

would be possible to -- to either order for the briefing

9

on the issue or to grant the question now at this

10

juncture.

11

the question that the Court did grant on as encompassing

12

the Federal common law -

13

I think it would also be conceivable to read

JUSTICE BREYER:

You see, I want to be fair

14

to them.

15

other side to be sure they have a chance to say

16

everything they have to say.

17

I mean, we want -- you want to be fair to the

MS. KRUGER:

That's what's worrying me.

Well, Your Honor, that is an

18

important consideration.

I do think that in the opening

19

brief the Petitioners did brief the question of what

20

effect is to be given to a waiver if indeed a waiver is

21

not prohibited by the anti-alienation clause.

22

Federal common law rule that Petitioners suggest is one

23

that does, I think, naturally invite some consideration

24

of the conflicting statutory directive in the form of

25

the plan documents principle that this Court has
25
Alderson Reporting Company

And that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

recognized in its earlier cases.

2

reply brief Petitioners did address this issue in full.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And certainly in its

Did -- did we recognize in

4

earlier cases that beneficiary designations are plan

5

documents?

6

MS. KRUGER:

Well, Your Honor, I think the

7

question of whether beneficiary designation forms,

8

counsel plan documents, is a little bit beside the

9

point.

The -- the plan documents in this case do

10

specify a procedure for determining who is to receive

11

benefits.

12

designated beneficiary, the person who is designated by

13

the participant.

14

beneficiary designations shall be made in the manner

15

that's prescribed by the plan.

16

It says that benefits will be paid to the

And it says that changes to those

And so, because the plan sets out a

17

procedure for changing beneficiary designations, we

18

think that it would be inappropriate to look beyond that

19

to require plan administrators to look to extrinsic

20

documents in order to determine whether one of them

21

overrides that designation.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Again, assuming there has

23

been a change of beneficiary designation, and, of

24

course, the argument you're confronted with is:

25

haven't changed anything.

I

The prior beneficiary simply
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- simply refused to accept it, waived it.

2

changed the designation at all.

3

MS. KRUGER:

I haven't

Well, in this case there is a

4

conflict then between the wishes of the participant, who

5

by all accounts would have chosen not to change the

6

beneficiary designation, and that of the beneficiary.

7

And in that case in order to effectuate the

8

-- the interests of all parties involved in order to

9

provide certainty to all parties in ascertaining what

10

their rights are with respect to the plan, then it is

11

incumbent on the plan administrator to abide by the

12

designated beneficiary.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think it's a harder

14

question than you make it; and I, for one, have not gone

15

into it as deeply as I would like to, principally

16

because we rejected that -- that question.

17

MS. KRUGER:

Well, again, Your Honor, we

18

think it would be appropriate for the Court to go on to

19

address that question because the issues have been fully

20

aired both in the Fifth Circuit and in the briefing in

21

this Court.

22

reserve that question for a later time, I think that

23

would be fine as well.

24
25

But if the Court were inclined to -- to

And -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Am I right in

understanding that there is a fairly sharp circuit split
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on that question, even that majority of the circuits are

2

contrary to the Government's position?

3

MS. KRUGER:

That is correct.

There is a

4

circuit split on the question as was raised in the

5

petition for certiorari, and the Second and Sixth

6

Circuits are the circuits that have to date agreed with

7

the position that we are espousing here:

8

documents control and preclude formulation of a Federal

9

common law rule of the sort that Petitioner proposes.

10
11
12
13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That the plan

And which circuits

are on the other side?
MS. KRUGER:

There are a number of them

including the Fifth, the Seventh, the Third.
The reason why the plan documents rule is so

15

important in this case is because it serves important

16

statutory interests in certainty, certainty of the

17

parties as well as certainty of the administrators.

18

And it is clear; it is easy to apply; it

19

makes it possible for administrators to do their jobs

20

without fear of further litigation in case they happen

21

to make what a court may later in the proceedings

22

determine is the wrong choice.

23

For that reason, we think that ERISA is

24

clear, and that it doesn't permit the kind of Federal

25

common law rule that Petitioner proposes, which is one
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that would essentially revise the statute to override

2

the plan documents rule and would require substantial

3

burdens on the plan and would yield uncertainty for the

4

parties.

5

For that reason we would ask the Court to

6

affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on

7

alternative grounds or, alternatively, it should remand

8

for further proceedings.

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY MARK I. LEVY

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13

MR. LEVY:

14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

15

In light of the Court's questions, I want to

16

begin with the plan documents argument and first the

17

procedural question of whether it's properly before the

18

Court.

19

We think that it is.
It's well within the settled doctrine of an

20

alternative ground for affirmance.

21

and the Fifth Circuit has decided the issue in other

22

cases.

23

Fifth Circuit thinks about this issue, and, therefore,

24

there is no point in a remand.

25

We don't dispute that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was raised below,

So we know what the

Do you know of any case in

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which we've done this -

2

MR. LEVY:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

I do.
-- rejected the question

and then decided it?

5

MR. LEVY:

I apologize if it's not in the

6

brief, but a case I could find was called Piper Aircraft

7

versus Rayno 454 U.S. 235.

8

limited its grant of certiorari, but then went ahead and

9

decided a question that wasn't subsumed within that

And in that case the court

10

question because they found it appropriate to the proper

11

disposition of the case.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

But is that

13

a case in which the question the court decided was

14

presented in the petition, the court said we are not

15

going to take that question then they decided it on that

16

ground anyway.

17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:
Yes.

19
20

That's what I'm asking.

MR. LEVY:

I'm not sure of the answer to

that.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

You don't know of any case.

23

MR. LEVY:

You are sure of the answer.

I think Piper is at least a first

24

cousin if not a direct sibling of the issue that we've

25

got here.

I don't disagree that it is in the Court's
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discretion.

The Court has discretion, I think, one -

2

either way whether it wants to decide this or wants

3

remand, but we think it would be appropriate -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess you agree

5

that it's a question of which the circuits have split,

6

so presumably there are good arguments on both sides,

7

and it's one that your friend hasn't had a full

8

opportunity to brief here.

9

confident of the answer, I think, to go ahead and decide

10

So we'd have to be pretty

it.

11

MR. LEVY:

Well, actually I think the Court

12

will be confident if it looks into it.

13

this is the classic case of an alternative ground for

14

affirmance of the judgment.

15

topside party always has to deal with that issue in its

16

reply brief and only in its reply brief.

17

nothing unfair about the -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But beyond that

When that arises, the

So there is

It would be the classic

19

case but for the fact that we had rejected that

20

question.

21

no, it would be the classic case, I agree.

22

Had we not been asked to decide it and said

MR. LEVY:

And I agree.

That makes it

23

within the Court's discretion.

It doesn't have to

24

decide it, but we think there are good reasons here.

25

It's been fully briefed, including by the Petitioner for
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the reason I just said.

2

we have addressed it.

Court, and there is nothing unfair about deciding it.

4

In addition -

5

Four amici have addressed it;
So it's properly before the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can we expect that to

6

happen in future cases when we turn down a question and

7

amici and people come in and brief the question anyway

8

and then ask us to decide it?

9

MR. LEVY:

I wouldn't think so.

The fact

10

that we can't find another case, either, I think makes

11

this one unique.

12

And I think there are good reasons -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think there is a

13

question of the way it was phrased.

14

court just didn't get it, what that question on which we

15

didn't grant cert was driving at.

16

MR. LEVY:

17

And perhaps the

I would be loathe to make that

suggestion, Justice Ginsburg.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. LEVY:

But it may well -- it's possible

20

that that could be the explanation or the Court with

21

fuller consideration -- I mean, the issue has been fully

22

24

a -- to decide this.

the Petitioners.

Would you like to argue

the question that is here?

17

MR. LEVY:

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. LEVY:

Yes -

-- I would.

I take it the Court

20

doesn't need argument on the merits of the plan

21

documents issues, since that's already been discussed,

22

so let me turn to the QDRO question.

23

question that was -- that was granted and was discussed

24

fully in the briefs.

25

That is the

Now, as to the QDRO part of the case, the
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rule of law that governs this case is that pension plan

2

administrators must pay benefits in accordance with a

3

qualified domestic relations order, and they may not pay

benefits in accordance with a nonqualified order.

5

That rule follows from two separate and

6

different analyses.

provision, and the other is the QDRO provision in

8

subparagraph (H) of section 1056.

9

discussed in our brief.

10
11

One is the anti-alienation

latter?

Where would I find the

If I wanted to read it?

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. LEVY:

They are both

Which I do.

I don't find this all that

14

pleasant reading, but it's on page 21A of the statutory

15

appendix to the red brief.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21A?

17

MR. LEVY:

And it's (H)(ii) and (iii).

21A.

18

And I want to start with this because it is really is

19

the more straightforward analysis and avoids a lot of

20

questions under the anti-alienation provision.

21

argument would prevail whether or not the purported

22

waiver is deemed to be an assignment or alienation under

23

1056(d)(1) and (d)(3).

24
25

This

Now, we think it is and I'll come back to
that under the IRS regulation, but let me start with
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this alternative argument that's also made in the brief.

2

Under ERISA, a domestic relations order is

3

either a qualified order or a nonqualified order.

4

ERISA expressly provides that if it's a nonqualified

5

order, as it is here, the plan administrator may not pay

6

benefits pursuant to that order.

7

And

Justice Scalia, since you're on page 21A,

8

let's look at subparagraph (H)(iii).

9

red brief.

It provides that:

This is 21A of the

If an order is not

10

qualified, the plan administrator shall pay the benefits

11

to the person or persons who would be entitled to such

12

benefits if there had been no order.

13

no order.

14

it and pays it to the person -- this is in (iii),

15

Justice Scalia.

16

If there had been

In other words, the administrator disregards

Contrast that with subparagraph (H)(ii)

17

right above it, where the order is qualified:

18

administrator shall pay the benefits to the person

19

entitled thereto under the order.

20

So, it gives you two choices.

21

qualified order, the plan must pay.

22

qualified order, the plan -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

If it's a

If it's not a

Well, that doesn't make too

24

much sense, does it, where all that happens is it's just

25

waived.

The wife waived the amount because when she
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

waived the amount, she doesn't give it to anybody.

2

just doesn't take it.

3

it goes to the person who made up the plan.

4

little hard to pay to him, because he is dead.

5

She

So it goes to the beneficiary It's a

So I mean if you read it literally, it

6

doesn't seem to apply, these (ii) and (iii), to the case

7

before us, which is a case of waiver.

8

argument, yes, she makes is that throughout the law,

9

waiver is treated differently.

And of course the

And if it weren't, you'd

10

have to pay gift tax, for example, when you waive a

11

benefit that's given to you by someone else.

12

And so let's interpret this and make sense

13

of the language you quoted, and consistent with the rest

14

of the law to say a waiver is waivered.

15

something to somebody else.

Okay.

The one person who

couldn't be an alternate payee is the payor.

necessarily goes back to some alternate payee, as it

The other thing is that we are not saying -

our position today does not mean that divorcing parties

can -- can be foreclosed from eliminating the death

7

benefits -- the death benefits for the designated

beneficiary; but they have to follow procedures that

of Mary Dineen, the plan's administrator, specifically

3

at paragraph 20, page 76, where she says in bold:

4

its receipt" -- meaning the April 26, 2001, letter from

5

Kari Kennedy Duckworth -- "Exhibit No. 1 was maintained

6

as a record of DuPont with regard to the SIP account of

7

William Patrick Kennedy."

8

paragraph 20.

9

business of DuPont to maintain a copy of this letter

"Upon

That's joint appendix 76,

It was within the regular course of

10

with other DuPont letters relating to Mr. Kennedy's SIP

11

account at the time the letter was received from its

12

sender.

13

that follows on.

14

And there it says the divorce decree was attached.

15

The letter is then attached as the next exhibit
That would be about pages 78 to 79.

Make no mistake:

DuPont had that divorce

16

decree and could see the knowing, voluntary waiver and

17

had it well in advance of making its decision to pay

18

money to a woman who went off to Norway and paid her

19

when she was over there, where there was no prospect of

20

grabbing it back and turning it over to the executor.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They look at it and

22

say, is this a QDRO?

23

the other provision, I guess on page 21a in the red

24

brief, and say:

25

And if no, then they go back to

If it's not a QDRO, ignore it.

MR. FURLOW:

Well, Your Honor, it's more

interesting than that, actually, in that if you look to

2

page 68 of the joint appendix you'll see Mary Dineen,

3

the administrator, was saying, quote:

4

disclaimed her designation of the beneficiary of

5

Mr. Kennedy's SIP, that declination or disclaimer or a

6

copy would have been included in the beneficiary

7

designation file."

8

waivers.

9

Latin way of saying waiver.

"Had Liv Kennedy

So they're taking disclaimers or

They're taking declinations, which is a fancy
They've got them in their

10

files.

They're acting on it.

11

pay the money to the person who has voluntarily waived,

12

knowing the issue, not asking their in-house counsel at

13

no cost to make an examination here.

14

they can later take this plan documents rule and take it

15

all the way to this court.

of the divorce degree?

18

that point?

19

MR. FURLOW:

And why?

Was this waiver only part

Do you agree with your friend on

Well, this waiver was the part

20

in which Liv Kennedy waived all right so that he

21

retained all of his -

So that

But -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

But here they decided to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's not separate and

apart from the divorce decree.
MR. FURLOW:

It was not separate and apart.

In fact, when they were transferring benefits they knew

what to do and they used the waiver to transfer part of

2

the benefits.

3

It is interesting, Your Honors, that they

4

talked about the plan documents rule, but their own

5

documentation says, their own plan says, that the only

6

plan documents -- and I quoted it here on page 25 of our

7

reply brief -- "The official plan documents are the E.I.

8

DuPont de Nemours & Company savings and investment plan

9

and the trust agreement," not beneficiary designations.

10

So they give no notice.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have anything

12

more to say on the plan document, the plan document

13

issue than what you've said here.

MR. FURLOW:

Oh, I could come up with lots

That's a bad idea.

Okay.

Thank you,

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
