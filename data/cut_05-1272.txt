ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9
10

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Tenth Circuit in this case correctly

12

held that Stone could not share in the award given by

13

the jury unless he was an original source of pondcrete

14

allegations.

15

original source based upon a misinterpretation of the

16

core requirements of the statutory definition.

17

But it then went on to find that he was an

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Mahoney, let me ask you

18

a question.

19

if he was not an original source, not only shouldn't he

20

get any money, but neither should the government.

21

that the way the statute reads?

22

Am I wrong about this?

MS. MAHONEY:

It seems to me that

Your Honor, that is one

23

possible interpretation of the statute.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

possible one?

Isn't

How is there any other

It says there's no jurisdiction in this
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

situation.

2

MS. MAHONEY:

I think the way that the

3

courts have handled it below is that it says that

4

there's no jurisdiction unless it is a claim brought by

5

a relator who is an original source or if it's brought

6

by the United States.

7

think courts deem it to at that point be viewed as a

8

claim brought by the United States.

9

retroactive amendment of the pleadings.

10
11

And if the relator drops out, I

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's sort of a

It's not brought by the

United States as long as he's still there.

12

MS. MAHONEY:

That's correct.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MS. MAHONEY:

That's your argument.

Well, it can't be, Your Honor,

15

because under the statutory terms, under section 3720(a)

16

the Attorney General has the authority to bring a claim

17

on behalf of the United States.

18

for the United States to bring a claim on behalf of the

19

relator.

20

section 3730, and that's a section (b), which authorizes

21

a relator to bring a claim on behalf of himself and the

22

United States.

23

There is no authority

Instead there is a second type of claim under

Similarly, Your Honor, if you look at the

24

provisions in section (d), which authorize an award to a

25

relator, it requires that the action be one brought
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under section (b), that is in other words it be an

2

action brought by the relator which the United States

3

then proceeds on for (d)(1).

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess it really depends

5

on whether you think the language "if the Government

6

proceeds with an action" is equivalent to the

7

Government's bringing the action.

8
9

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, I don't think it can be,

Your Honor, because if you look at the language

10

throughout these sections, it differentiates between two

11

kinds of actions, actions brought by the United States

12

or the Attorney General and actions brought by the

13

relator.

14

relator under section (b) that authorizes an award under

15

section (d).

16
17
18

And it is only an action brought by the

And it consistently talks about that.

What they're really arguing, Your Honor, is
that JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait.

It says under

19

3, what is it, (c)(3) I guess, if the elects not to

20

proceed with the action, the person who initiated the

21

action shall have the right to conduct the action.

22

that suggests that if the Government intervenes the

23

Government is proceeding with the action, right?

24

MS. MAHONEY:

That's correct.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you say that's
5


Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different from the Government bringing the action.

2

MS. MAHONEY:

Absolutely.

If you look at,

3

if you look at the language in section (d), for

4

instance, it says if the government proceeds with an

5

action brought by a person under section, subsection

6

(b).

7

subsection (b) in order to authorize an award at all.

8

The Government has -- has authority under subsection (a)

9

to bring an action, but it has no authority to bring it

10
11

In other words, it has to be an action under

on behalf of the relator.
The statute consistently uses these same

12

terms, and this Court in Graham County, which was a

13

decision dealing with the statute of limitations,

14

actually described this section in the same way, saying

15

that there are two kinds of actions, those that are

16

brought by the Attorney General under subsection (a) and

17

those that are brought by a relator under subsection

18

(b), which the United States can then proceed with.

19

What the relator is really arguing here is

20

that if you look at the -- at subsection (e)(4), they're

21

adding a phrase that's not there.

22

there's no jurisdiction over an action under this

23

section if it is brought by the Attorney General or

24

brought by a relator who is an original source or the

25

United States intervenes and proceeds with the action.

They're saying that

6

Alderson Reporting Company

2

And that's not in here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're being very

3

picky-picky with this text, considering that you're

4

willing to swallow whole the notion that so long as

5

the -- so long as the original party, so long as the

6

non-government plaintiff drops out, all of a sudden it

7

become as action brought by the United States.

8

very, very expansive notion of what "brought by the

9

United States" means.

10

That's a

What I'm saying is or, to put it another

11

way, if you take your picky-picky notion of being

12

brought by the United States, to be logical about it you

13

must reach the conclusion that if you defeat the private

14

plaintiff under -- under he's not original source, the

15

whole thing is thrown out, not just his recovery but the

16

Government's recovery.

17
18
19
20
21

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, of course that

would be great for Rockwell, and so JUSTICE SCALIA:

I know, but it would be so

extreme that we're not likely to buy it.
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, we don't argue for that

22

because I think that the Court has said that the

23

Government's intervention does not cure defects with

24

respect to the relator, and therefore, if the relator

25

didn't have -- that -- doesn't have standing -- you
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

know, part of this goes to the issue of the Stevens

2

assignment.

3

don't even have standing to be in the action, they have

4

no right to recover.

5

If they don't have an assignment, then they

And so if you're correct that it can't be

6

cured, in effect, through a procedure like, say, 28

7

U.S.C. section 1553, which allows amendments to

8

defective jurisdictional allegations where I think that,

9

while the courts don't technically require it, they

10

could say that really this, while it was pled as a

11

section (b) action, when the relator drops out we could

12

treat it as a section (a) action, because -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Otherwise, the Attorney

14

General could just bring it all over again, a fresh

15

complaint, and that would be wasted motion?

16

MS. MAHONEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I

17

think it is a pragmatic rule.

But again, if the rule is

18

that they lose as well, then so be it.

19

statute uses the term that is used in section (a), which

20

is "brought by the United States."

21

sense because otherwise think of what the consequences

22

are if the relator can simply copy an indictment, file a

23

complaint, and say -- and the Government intervenes

24

because it's a major action, and then they say, aha,

25

you're stuck with me because you've intervened and now
8

Alderson Reporting Company

The fact is this

5

MS. MAHONEY:

They don't have to give

The court doesn't have to.
Your Honor, I think that you

could say that they don't have to give them money.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

his attorneys' fees.

9

isn't it?

10

But you'd then have to pay

That's what really this is about,

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, it is about that, but we

11

don't have to pay his attorneys' fees, Your Honor, if he

12

doesn't get a share, because the way that section (d) is

13

written is it says that a relator who is paid a share of

14

the proceeds shall also be entitled to attorneys' fees.

15

So this is not just an issue between the United States

16

and Stone.

17

upon whether he's entitled to a share.

18

weren't an issue of jurisdiction, if he's not entitled

19

to a share under a section (d)(1), then he's also not

entitled to attorneys' fees.

So even if this

But the share is not the only issue that
makes the Government's -- or that makes Stone's argument

That is that once the relator is in

So it makes no sense to read this statute to

It instead makes much more sense to read the

terms the way they're used elsewhere in the statute, to

mean that there is only jurisdiction if it is a section

16

That's what makes sense of the

If I could turn to the issue of whether or

17

not the Tenth Circuit correctly held that Stone had

18

direct and independent knowledge of the information on

19

which his allegations were based.

20

that every act that he had to prove in order to recover

21

on the pondcrete allegations -- whether they're measured

22

at the beginning of the case or the end of the case

23

doesn't matter -- every single act occurred after he

24

left the plaintiff, after he had left his job.

25

can see that from the outset of the case.

It bears emphasis

10
Alderson Reporting Company

And we

If you look

at his Responses to Interrogatories at JA-189 to 190, he

2

identifies the factual basis for the pondcrete

3

allegations that he is asserting.

4

basis is described he is asserting and that factual

5

basis is described as Rockwell's knowing storage of

6

pondcrete on outdoor pads at the plant in violation of

RCRA with false certification from 1987 to 1989.

And that factual

Now, he left his job in March of 1986.

could he possibly have direct and independent knowledge

certain circumstances.

Perhaps, Your Honor, in
I think the key question is
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what's the standard, and he has to have substantial

2

knowledge about core fraudulent acts.

3

reasonable in your hypothetical or some others to infer

4

that he knew plenty about this fraudulent conduct and

5

had plenty of reason to conclude that it was continuing

6

on.

7

And it may be

But here, Your Honor, nothing of the kind

8

happened.

He didn't know about any fraudulent conduct

9

pertaining to pondcrete before he left.

And In fact,

10

his allegations start in 1987.

He does not say that

11

there were pondcrete violations before then and indeed

12

there were not.

13

The reason there weren't is because when he

14

was at the plant Rockwell was producing hard pondcrete,

15

hard pondcrete, and it wasn't storing it on site, it was

16

shipping it to Nevada.

17

even clear that it was subject to RCRA because DOE

18

didn't enter into a RCRA compliance agreement until

19

after he left.

So he couldn't -- and it wasn't

20

He also concedes in his deposition that he

21

was not, except with one exception -- he was not aware

22

of any time when Rockwell affirmatively represented that

23

it was in compliance with environmental safety and

24

health provisions when it was not.

25

he didn't -- unlike your hypothetical, he didn't know
12
Alderson Reporting Company

That's JA-106.

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

anything about there being a pondcrete fraud prior to

2

the time of his departure and doesn't even allege one.

3

Instead, what the Tenth Circuit rested upon was the fact

4

that he had reviewed a design for making pondcrete 5

5

years -- in fact, not for making pondcrete; it was

6

actually a design for removing sludge from the ponds -

7

5 years before any of the events at issue here, and he

8

said he predicted there would be a design problem.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It wouldn't have to

10

have anything to do with pondcrete at all.

The statute

11

just says the information on which his allegations are

12

based.

13

give rise to a recovery.

14

MS. MAHONEY:

They don't say the allegations that eventually

Your Honor, every court that

15

has considered that question has said that it has to be

16

analyzed on what they call a claim by claim basis.

17

me explain the reason.

18

what they mean by claim by claim.

19

factual theory of falsity, and that it has to be done on

20

a claim by claim basis, and here's why -

21
22
23

Let

First of all, let me explain

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They really mean a

Factual theory of falsity,

that doesn't mean anything to me.
MS. MAHONEY:

A theory of falsity.

In other

24

words, a claim, what is called a claim in these cases in

25

the claim by claim analysis is a theory of falsity.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other words, it's why were -- why was the fraudulent

2

claim false?

3

instance, of compliance with let's say all laws and

4

there could be five different, completely different fact

5

patterns as to why that was false, and the damages might

6

be completely differ as well.

Because there may be a certification, for

7

So all of the courts have said that's really

8

the way that FCA cases are litigated, that's really what

9

we call a claim.

10

And then, moving back, if you didn't do it

11

on a claim by claim basis, you would allow a relator to

12

copy an indictment that he knows nothing about, come to

13

court, file it, add one theory that he does know about,

14

an overcharge for five dollars on a hammer, say that,

15

I'm now entitled to proceed on the whole thing and if

16

the Government doesn't intervene I get a minimum of 25

look at it.

20

relator in a situation who alleges a particular fraud

21

that causes the government to examine the books and

22

uncovers a different fraud to recover on that basis.

23

It's an unusual situation to have a jurisdictional

24

prerequisite determined only after the case is over.

25

Another way would be you would allow a

MS. MAHONEY:

But, Your Honor, it doesn't

The interrogatories -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you only show

that it's wrong at the end, you still say that they
should be thrown out.

11

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, we do, Your Honor but it

12

is not by any means necessary to the outcome in this

13

case.

14

least allow for the possibility of looking at the end of

15

the case, whether there is jurisdiction or not, is

16

because of the nature of this particular jurisdictional

17

bar.

18

nature of the allegations at issue in the case.

And the reason why I think that you do have to at

This is a jurisdictional bar that turns on the

19

Much like -- I think the Foreign Sovereign

20

Immunities Act is a perfect example because it too talks

21

about jurisdiction being predicated on, for instance,

22

commercial -- claims that are based upon commercial

23

activity.

24

the case when the 12(b)(1) motion is filed posits one

25

theory of the case that involves a predicate commercial

Suppose that the plaintiff at the outset of

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

act.

But when it gets to trial he's abandoned that

2

theory and now he doesn't have any commercial act.

3

Surely the Court would say you have to satisfy

4

jurisdiction over the theory that has actually gone to

5

trial.

6

This statute is very much the same.

And it

7

should not be read in a way that allows relators to

8

simply disguise the true basis of their claims, hide the

9

relevance of the public information, and then just shift

10

gears when you get to trial.

11

But here again, if we just look at the very

12

beginning of the case, he does identify in those

13

interrogatory responses, for instance, what the factual

14

basis for the pondcrete allegations are.

15

factual basis is all identified as -- as core acts that

16

occurred after he left the plant.

17

in this case and say that the trial court erred at the

18

outset by not dismissing this portion of his claim as

19

well as, in fact, should have dismissed the whole thing,

20

Your Honor.

21
22

So we can look back

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, his allegation

was that this, the design is not going to work.

23

MS. MAHONEY:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

All that

But Your Honor That's not an

allegation that's -- I mean, it is either true or it's
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not true.

2

after he's been terminated, that it doesn't work, I

3

don't see how that should affect the validity of his

4

allegations.

5

The fact that you find out after he's left,

MS. MAHONEY:

Because, Your Honor, this,

6

this is a statute about fraud.

It's not a statute

7

that's violated because Rockwell may have had a

8

suboptimal pipe.

9

violation.

That's not, that's not even the RCRA

That's not -- and it is certainly not a

10

False Claims Act violation.

plan to defraud the United States.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They weren't selling

their compliance with the applicable laws -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- based upon their

pondcrete design.

18

MS. MAHONEY:

At the time that he was there

19

that was not actually -- he didn't even allege that he

20

knew they were doing that with respect to pondcrete.

21

didn't allege that there were any problems with respect

22

to the pondcrete production or, or certifications during

23

his tenure.

25

alleged with respect to that pondcrete.

He

From -- they began producing pondcrete in
And there were no problems that were

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

His claim by his own admission starts in

2

1987, after he was gone.

And again, the mere fact that

3

there may have been a defective pipe wouldn't establish

4

the RCRA violation, because what they had to show by

5

their owning pleading here was that they were storing it

6

on site, that it was actually leaking, and, of course,

7

the mere fact there may have been a problem with the

8

pipe doesn't mean it is actually going to leak, because

9

they can fix it in a variety of ways.

They can add more

10

cement, they can put it in metal containers, they can do

11

a myriad of things.

12

He didn't even say he knew know that there

13

was a plan to not remedy and problems in the design that

14

he had identified if and when there became a problem

15

with it.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Am, am I correct that they

17

were, in fact, using that same pipe or that same pipe

18

system during a period when perfectly fine cement blocks

19

were being produced?

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, I think that it's

conceded that -- well, their own counsels told the jury

Alderson Reporting Company

that they were making it wrong, they weren't adding

2

enough cement, that that was the reason that it was

3

failing; and the Government told the jury that they were

4

making it fine until they reduced the ratio of cement.

5

So yes, I think it is correct that it has been conceded

6

at trial that the system was working fine as long as

7

they were adding enough cement.

But instead what happens after he left -

allegation that this design is not going to work, the

pondcrete is not going to work, and the Government,

14

prompted by his lawsuit, investigates it and finds out

that because of human error they're not making it the

right way, even if the design does work, he get no

entitled to share in the recovery that the Government

2

eventually receives?

3

MS. MAHONEY:

If -- the mere fact that he is

4

a trigger for the Government discovery of a different

5

problem, no, that is not a basis for recovery.

6

statute says that if there has been a public disclosure,

7

there's no public disclosure it is no problem.

12

knowledge of the information on which the allegations

13

are based.

14

Direct knowledge is one of the key things that the Tenth

15

Circuit just did not -

16

Bit if there has been a public

And that has to be a substantial standard.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You would, you would

17

change that to say direct knowledge of the information

18

not on which the allegations are based, but on which

19

recovery is eventually -- eventually ordered?

20

MS. MAHONEY:

On which the allegations of

21

the claim is based.

In other words, it, it's not -- it

22

has to be -- and the Government says this as well -

23

they say under that Section D(1), the relator isn't

24

entitled to share in the proceeds of anything that the

25

jury gives.

The relator is only entitled to share in
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the proceeds of a claim for which they were an original

2

source or for which they brought the -- brought the

3

action under, under Section B.

4

Sometimes the Government intervenes and adds

5

its own claims not on behalf of the relator, because it

6

doesn't have authority on behalf of the relator, and it

7

takes the position, I think correctly, that the relator

8

isn't entitled to a share in those circumstances.

9

And Your Honor, this -- the courts have

10

identified all the ways in which this statute doesn't

11

make any sense if it is looked at on -

5

Government said we prefer a variance of your theory, and

6

the relator said fine, "I don't want to put competing

7

theories before the jury, so I'll surrender my first

8

theory and go with the Government's," why should the

9

relator be penalized for that good litigation practice?

10

It doesn't necessarily mean that the original complaint

11

is no good or even that it might not have been proved,

12

if the Government had preferred another route.

MS. MAHONEY:

And if the

What was the public

disclosure of the claim that ultimately prevailed?

19

MS. MAHONEY:

The public -- there -- the

20

public disclosure was in 19 -- it can be from several

21

pieces.

22

of the fact that pondcrete was being stored at Rocky

23

Flats on outdoor pads, that it was leaking and that the

24

reason it was occurring was because the employees had

25

reduced the ratio of cement.

But in 1988, there were widely covered stories

was made in the newspapers rather than in an official

Government proceeding?

6

MS. MAHONEY:

That's correct.

It was in the

7

newspapers.

But it was definitely covered, Your Honor.

8

And that was more than a year before he brought his

And then in addition, there were disclosures of

allegations of performance bonuses being paid based upon

falsified evaluations.

And what he

He said that in the very beginning of the

And at trial, what the testimony was -- and I

10

at 987, the issue there was the variability of the

11

sludge which may have caused greater inspections and may

12

have required additional cement.

13

And what is very important is even

14

Mr. Freibach who is the first foreman, on whom

15

petitioners rely, he testified that during his tenure,

16

the variation of the sludge required between 200 and 350

17

pounds of cement.

18

and the joint appendix at 522.

19

That's at the trial transcript at 987

Yeah.

Let me -- let me

look at what -- let me look at 175.

This is, this what

he says.

23

out -- "would result in an unstable mixture that would

24

later deteriorate and cause unwanted release of toxic

25

wastes to the environment.

"After careful study, I concluded that the

I also noted based on my

analysis of chemical processes at Rocky Flats that that

the sludge and liquid present in the -- present in the

evaporation ponds contained some of the most toxic and

4

radioactive substances at Rocky Flats."

5

I mean, that's all very good, but it has

6

nothing to do with what this company was convicted of,

7

which is not -- cutting down on the amount of cement it

8

was adding.

9

MS. VULLO:

10

That's -

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. VULLO:

Your Honor, one of the pieces of

2

evidence -- and I would -- out of 55 witnesses and 500

3

documents, was that there were certain people who were

4

using too little cement.

5

There was also evidence -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but was the reason they

6

were using too little cement, the reason that there was

7

a variation in the amount of liquid being taken out with

8

the sludge as you've described to us that he had

9

claimed, or was the reason simply that there was a kind

10

of standard ratio of cement to sludge and that standard

11

ratio was not followed in the later cases?

12

In other words, is it because there was such

13

a tremendous variation in the liquid in the sludge or

14

simply because there was a standard formula having no

15

particular relationship to the liquid in the sludge, and

16

they simply didn't follow the standard formula?

17

thought the government's theory was the latter, and if

18

it was the latter, it has nothing to do with the claim

19

that he was making that there was too much variation in

20

the amount of liquid in the sludge.

21

MS. VULLO:

I

That's not correct,

22

Justice Souter.

The reason for the variation and the

23

need for additional cement was because the sludge had

24

variations and there was too much liquid in it, which

25

was precisely what Mr. Stone said.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

And every one of the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

witnesses testified to huge variation of the liquid

2

content in the sludge which required more cement, and

3

even the amount of cement that was required was very

4

variable.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if they had followed

6

the formula that they followed at the beginning, isn't

7

it true that there's no evidence that even these

8

variations in the liquid in the sludge would have

9

resulted in instable or insolid pondcrete?

10

MS. VULLO:

No.

That's not correct,

22

MS. VULLO:

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I have a question.

Yes, Justice Stevens.
As I understand the

24

statute, you his the first prong.

It has to be an

25

action based on public disclosure of information, which
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you agree it was; is that right?

2

MS. VULLO:

Justice Stevens, we in the

3

courts below agreed for purposes of the original source

4

provision that there was a public disclosure.

5

what's important following up on the question -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think

You agree that it's within

7

4(a), that it was an action based on a public disclosure

8

of information disclosed in newspapers; is that right?

9

MS. VULLO:

In newspapers and also the

10

criminal investigation, but I think what's important is

11

that the standard that Rockwell seeks to have this Court

12

adopt would actually require such a great level of

13

specificity that is not in the public disclosure at all.

14

And I think, Justice Stevens, you asked that precise

15

question.

16

the Tenth Circuit -

17

The public disclosure was very general.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

I am asking you, really

18

what I'm seeking to find out is what is the scope of the

19

public disclosure that everyone agrees was made?

20

all newspapers?

21

MS. VULLO:

Was it

It was newspapers, and the FBI

22

agents' search warrant affidavit was also publicly

23

disclosed prior to Mr. Stone's filing of the action.

disclosed in the newspapers, does that fit into one of
33

4

the categories of public disclosure mentioned in 4(a)?
MS. VULLO:

Yes.

It says news reports in

that provision of the statute.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

And everybody agrees on

5

what those news reports contained?

6

MS. VULLO:

Well, I'm not sure what Rockwell

7

agrees, but I could tell Your Honor what I believe those

8

news reports said, and they said that there were

9

environmental violations.

There were some news reports

10

in June of 1988 about a spill on the pondcrete pads.

11

Not a single one of the news reports about the spill on

12

the pondcrete pads described at all any false claim or

13

false statement, and neither did the agents' search

14

warrant affidavit.

15
16
17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you're saying that the

original source of the information was published?
MS. VULLO:

I don't believe that that's the

18

appropriate test.

19

believe that the direct and independent knowledge

20

requirement is information on which the allegations are

21

based, and the allegations refer to Mr. Stone's

22

allegations at the commencement of the action.

23

all, it's a jurisdictional provision, and it should be

24

determined at the outset of the action.

25

It's not before this Court, but I

6

It

So I would assume that's the important

MS. VULLO:

Mr. Chief Justice, there is a

7

split in the circuits on that issue.

The issue was not

8

decided by the Court of Appeals and as I understand even

9

Rockwell's position, that is not Rockwell's position,

10

that Rockwell's position is like our position, that it's

11

information in the allegations of the complaint.

12

But I would submit that that would make no

13

difference in this case because Mr. Stone's knowledge is

14

direct and independent of the information in his

15

complaint as well as the information in the public

disclosure.

has to be very, very specific.

And if I could just get to the point of the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the trial evidence is wrong, it's wrong for two reasons.

2

The first is that the statute speaks in terms of

3

allegations.

4

In fact, in the provision E.2, which is a provision

5

regarding bringing claims against members of the

6

judiciary and members of Congress, Congress said

7

information or evidence, but in this provision E.4,

8

Congress only said information.

9

evidence would be wrong by virtue of the plain language

10

It does not speak in terms of evidence.

So looking at the trial

of the statute.

11

It also would be wrong as, Mr. Chief

12

MR. STEWART:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

2

One of the features of this case that may

3

appear anomalous is the fact that the government is

4

aligned with Stone.

5

that the entire recovery in this case should go to the

6

United States.

7

should be shared with the relator, and the government

8

agrees with Stone.

That is, it's Rockwell's position

It is Stone's position that the recovery

9

It might be natural for the Court to wonder,

10

why would it be in the government's interest to advocate

11

that a share of the money damages in this case should be

12

given to a private party.

13

government believes that there are three systemic

14

government interests that are implicated by this case

15

and that would be endangered if Rockwell's position

16

prevailed.

17

And the reason is that the

First, in our view, Stone is precisely the

18

type of relator that Congress intended to encourage.

19

Stone was somebody who had substantial firsthand

20

knowledge of Rockwell's environmental practices and of

21

its billing practices, and moreover, Stone was somebody

22

who didn't conceal his information from the government.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's all very nice,

24

but Congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who

25

ought to get rewarded or not.

It laid down some textual

with, the fact that you think this is the kind of person

irrelevant.

5

MR. STEWART:

And unless they are complied

We agree.

And as to Stone's

6

original complaint, the statute frames the inquiry as

7

whether Stone has direct and independent knowledge of

8

the information on which the allegations were based.

9

And we agree with Rockwell and with Stone that that

10

refers to the allegations in his complaint.

11

Now the allegations were fairly generalized.

12

They didn't refer specifically to pondcrete, and they

14

12

And I'd like to focus on this question of

the cause of the insolidity of the pondcrete because I

think to regard that as the theory of the government's

15

liability really reflects a misunderstanding of the

False Claims Act.

17

counts in this case, it was sufficient for the

18

government to prove that the pondcrete in fact failed,

19

leaked hazardous substances into the environment, that

20

Rockwell was aware that the pondcrete was failing, and

21

that Rockwell nevertheless continued to represent that

22

it was in compliance with the environmental laws.

23

For purposes of the False Claims Act

For purposes of proving those allegations,

24

it was not necessary for the Government to offer any

25

hypothesis as to why the pondcrete failed.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

It would

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have been sufficient to prove that the pondcrete failed

2

and that Rockwell knew about it.

3

encourage the Court to read the whole trial transcript,

4

but I think if the Court reads the plaintiff's statement

5

of claims, which is about 30 pages of the joint appendix

6

beginning at JA-463, that summarizes the events that

7

Rockwell -- I mean, I'm sorry, that Stone and the United

8

States intended to prove at trial, and by far the

9

predominant focus is on the fact of pondcrete failures

In fact, I wouldn't

and Rockwell's awareness that they had -- that pondcrete

11

had failed.

12

There were a couple of paragraphs in

13

those 30 pages that alluded to the supposition that the

14

cause of the failure was inadequate cement content.

15

There were also isolated references to that theory at

16

trial.

17

liability I think would be a misconception.

18

Government didn't have to persuade the jury one way or

19

the other as to why the pondcrete failed.

not only it was not because of that.

MR. STEWART:

Again, the statute doesn't

require direct and independent knowledge of the fraud.

5

It requires direct and independent knowledge of the

Prediction is not direct knowledge.
MR. STEWART:

I think independent of whether

there had every been a public disclosure, it would have

17

been open to Rockwell to argue in response to the

18

original complaint that Stone couldn't consistent with

19

Rule 11 make allegations as to what had happened at the

20

plant after he left because he no longer had an

21

evidentiary basis for doing so.

made that argument, again regardless of whether a public

disclosure had occurred, and the question whether it is

17

MR. STEWART:

That is what you say is

That knowledge, but I think

18

it's also important to recognize that the original

19

complaint was not focused on pondcrete specifically.

20

The original complaint alleged more generally that

21

Rockwell was engaged in widespread environmental safety

22

and health violations and was consistently

23

misrepresenting to the Government that it was in

24

compliance and -- even though it knew that it was not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you think relators can

2

get part of the Government's recovery even where their

3

initial allegations before the Government intervenes

4

have nothing whatever to do with the reason the

5

Government is ultimately giving money?

6

are still entitled to a piece of the pie?

MR. STEWART:

Right?

MR. STEWART:

It has to be connected with

And certainly, if you look at the

18

theory of liability that prevailed at trial, namely that

19

pondcrete blocks were leaking hazardous substances into

20

the environment and Rockwell was nevertheless asking for

21

Government funds based on misrepresentations that it was

that theory is logically encompassed within the more

What do you mean by

you think it's enough that he says, look, Rockwell is

complaint when you intervene on tax fraud?

7

out also that they didn't pay taxes.

to lie about pondcrete they're going to lie about taxes.

Is it -- I got -- I'm getting the sense that

No, and I think I would put

that with the hypothetical that I offered about the

Government adding a claim that Rockwell had

misrepresented its compliance with the

clear dividing line, but I think this is a line that

MR. STEWART:

I think we would -- I think

3

there could still be a sufficient connection even if his

4

reason for thinking the pondcrete failed, they all

5

turned out to be correct.

6

that that's particularly so here because the reason for

7

the pondcrete failure was not an element of the claim.

8

I mean, imagine if this case had been tried to the jury

9

and there had been an established rule in place that if

And again, we would emphasize

10

the pondcrete was shown to have failed because of a

11

defect in the machinery, Stone would get a share, but if

12

it was shown to have failed because the human operator

13

added too little cement Stone wouldn't get a share.

14

that had been the rule there would have been a clear

15

potential for disharmony between the Government and the

16

relator.

17

Justice Ginsburg alluded to, where the Government

18

prefers to emphasize one view of the facts rather than

another and the defendant is getting in the way by

20

suggesting that the relator will be deprived of a share.

It would have raised exactly the specter that

the company is guilty of cheating the Government, even

12

though the facts on which he bases it are entirely

wrong?

14

MR. STEWART:

Simply because he said

I mean, I need to know more

15

about the hypothetical, but my initial reaction is that

that's a complaint that's easily dismissed based on Rule

11, leaving aside the question of any public disclosure.

18

And I can imagine extreme hypotheticals -

19
20
21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, assume one that just

gets over the line.
MR. STEWART:

I think if the complaint just

22

gets over the line, that is if the evidence in the

23

relator's possession is just barely good enough to

24

sustain the allegation of fraud or at least to allow the

25

suit to go forward, there's no reason to read the public

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It turns out to be entirely

3

wrong.

Turns out to be entirely wrong, so that the only

4

reason he believed this company was defrauding the

5

Government was absolutely wrong.

6

MR. STEWART:

I think we would still want to

7

compare the nature of the fraud that the Government

8

alleged with the nature of the fraud that the relator

9

alleged.

And obviously this is a question in which the

10

Court is going to have to balance competing interests.

11

It's possible to come up with hypotheticals in which it

12

seems as though the relator has no equitable entitlement

13

to a share.

14

first, in terms of the way that the lawsuit progresses

15

even when the Government doesn't intervene, relators

16

once they file suit, if they are allowed to proceed on

17

their own, they presumably can take advantage of all of

18

the rules of civil procedure.

19

discovery provisions of the Federal Rules.

20

The two things we want to emphasize are,

And those include the

And it would obviously be self-defeating to

21

tell the relator:

You can invoke discovery and you can

22

learn relevant information from the defendant, but if

23

you didn't know it already you can't use it at trial,

24

because if you use something that you didn't have direct

25

and independent knowledge of before the complaint was
49
Alderson Reporting Company

filed and it turns out to be persuasive to the jury you

2

can be kicked for not being an original source.

3
4

I don't think Congress can be said to have
had that intention.

5

Second, in cases where the Government and

6

the relator intervenes -- where the Government

7

intervenes in the a relator's suit and the two prosecute

8

the suit together, we would want the Court to avoid a

9

rule that would create artificial disincentives to

10

cooperation between the two plaintiffs.

11

that relatively minor variations in factual assertions

12

that are ultimately not necessary to the establishment

13

of False Claims Act liability, if those carried the day

14

then relators in future circumstances would have a

15

strong disincentive to accede to the Government's

request that one view of the evidence be emphasized

17

rather than another.

4

that Rockwell knew that it was having that effect and

that it nevertheless represented to the Government it

would raise no public disclosure issue to begin with,

was revealed through discovery, there would be no need

for him to satisfy the original source test with respect

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MS. MAHONEY:

I would like to first just

22

address, the Government's suggested that he could be an

23

original source because he had knowledge of false

24

representations and concealments derived throughout his

25

employment.

I just want to emphasize that the Tenth
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Circuit did not rely on that theory, said that he did

2

not have to have knowledge of any fraudulent acts.

3

was just enough that he knew something that might be

4

relevant to the proof of an environmental violation.

5

And the reason that the Tenth Circuit said that was

6

because Stone had conceded in his deposition at pages

7

JA-106 and 112 that he did not know about any false

8

representations and he did not know whether DOE was

Mr. Stone wasn't there when the manufacturing problems

What they're really saying is that his theory about why

it might leak some day didn't turn out to be important

to the gravamen of the claim.
