Ms. Reid.


7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH L. REID


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10

MS. REID:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please


the Court:


11

The alienage diversity statute provides that the


12

Federal courts have original jurisdiction in civil actions


13

between citizens of different States and citizens who are


14

subjects of a foreign State where the matter in


15

controversy exceeds $75,000.

16

is whether respondent, Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure


17

Limited, a corporation incorporated under the laws of the


18

British Virgin Islands, qualifies as a subject of the 


19

United Kingdom within the meaning of that statute. 


20

Petitioner, JPMorgan Chase Bank, submits it clearly does.


21

The question presented today


It is well-settled that the term, citizens and


22

subjects, applies to corporations and not just natural


23

persons.

24

one who owes allegiance to and is under the protection of


25

a foreign State.


It is also not controversial that a subject is

1

QUESTION:

Is this a question of Federal law?


2

MS. REID:

In terms of looking to the matter of


3

the subject?


4

QUESTION:

In determining who is a citizen or


5

subject of a foreign State, or whether a corporation in


6

this instance is a citizen or subject?

7

law question?


8
9

MS. REID:

Is that a Federal


Yes, Your Honor, we would submit it


is in the first instance, but in saying that we must then


10

look at the nature of the relationship and look at the


11

foreign State which is asserting the sovereignty, and


12

certainly that is a matter that we should consider


13

carefully.

14

expressed its sovereignty over respondent and over the


15

other residents and corporations of its overseas


16

territories.


17

In this case, the United Kingdom has clearly


QUESTION:

When you say the United Kingdom has


18

expressed its sovereignty, Ms. Reid, do you mean that


19

you're looking at their statutes, or that their diplomatic


20

representatives have made a representation?


21

MS. REID:

Both, both the fact that they have


22

intervened as an amicus in this and in other cases, but


23

also, particularly in the case of respondent, if one looks


24

at the BVI constitution enacted in 1976, it is enacted as


25

a result of the act of parliament and the order of

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

parliament, and it reserves expressly all power to the


2

Crown ultimately, and it is only from the Crown that the


3

law is then delegated to the elected legislative council. 


4

Each member of whom must swear allegiance to the Crown and


5

to the Queen.


6

The United Kingdom reserves the right to review,


7

approve, and ultimately disapprove any statute that is


8

enacted in the British Virgin Islands, which is a right


9

that they do exercise.

In this case, therefore, the


10

enabling or enacting statute which, under which respondent


11

is incorporated, is a direct result of the authority


12

granted from the Crown, so I would argue it is not just a


13

matter of the diplomatic relationship and the fact that


14

the United Kingdom is the external face for the British


15

Virgin Islands in terms of matters of defense and


16

international relations, but also the fact that all law is


17

derived ultimately from the Crown.


18

QUESTION:

Ms. Reid, every corporation must be


19

formed under the law of some sovereign, and if that's


20

right, a corporation just can't generate itself.


21

Is there any corporation that is formed under


22

the law of some sovereign other than the United States not


23

included within 1332, or is this just a very simple case


24

where every foreign corporation of course is organized


25

under the law of some State, and therefore would qualify. 

5

1
2

Does your case involve anything more than that?

MS. REID:

I would say, Your Honor, in 99


3

percent of the cases, that you're right.

4

conceivable that you would have corporations organized by


5

someone who declares they are sovereign of some island


6

somewhere, but no one recognizes them as a sovereign, and


7

the United States would say, we know nothing of this


8

person, and know they can't be --


9
10

QUESTION:

I suppose it is


Then the United States would also say


that that's not a corporation.


11

MS. REID:

Right, exactly.


12

QUESTION:

So I think you could say in 100


13

percent of the cases if we acknowledge it as a


14

corporation, it will have been formed under the law of


15

some State.


16

MS. REID:

I would agree, Your Honor.


17

QUESTION:

And I suppose even as to natural


18

persons in this sort of eccentric island in the real


19

world, if we did not recognize their claim to individual


20

sovereignty or nationality, in the real world I assume


21

they would be subject to some other national sovereign and


22

they'd by that virtue, by virtue of that be swept up under


23

the term, citizen or subject, wouldn't they?


24

MS. REID:

I would agree.


25

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Let's assume -- and I'm not sure that


2

this is an actual proposition of international law, that a


3

subject of a sovereign has a special duty to obey the laws


4

of that sovereign.

5

special obligation to obey the laws of the United States


6

that a British subject does not.

7

have a special obligation to obey the laws of Great


8

Britain in any greater degree than it has the obligation

to obey the laws of any other sovereign to whom it might

11

MS. REID:

Yes, Your Honor.


12

QUESTION:

-- subject?


13

MS. REID:

An analogy, though, not completely


14

perfect, but it -- you know, JPMorgan Chase is a


15

corporation organized under the laws of the State of New


16

York.

17

New York, but it also has obligations that it has to


18

follow under our Federal law.


19

QUESTION:

Yes.


20

MS. REID:

Similarly, a corporation set up under


It obviously has to follow the laws of the State of


21

the laws of applicable overseas territories in the first


22

in stance, of course, must follow the laws of their


23

legislative district, but they must also abide by agreed-


24

upon laws and conventions of the United Kingdom, and that


25

is specifically an issue in the Caribbean, where there are

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

certain financial disclosure, which is mandated in part


2

through the relationship, constitutional relationship


3

between the United Kingdom --


4

QUESTION:

5
6

Where can we document the proposition


that you've just stated?
MS. REID:

What do I look to? 


To a certain extent, the treaty,


7

that -- for example the Narcotics Enforcement Treaty. 


8

There are also the United Kingdom -- the one I'm thinking


9

of is their recent overruling on the homosexuality, which


10

we cited only to a newspaper article in our brief, will


11

demonstrate that.


12

The best sites are the web sites for the BVI and


13

for the United Kingdom, which detail the relationship


14

between these two entities, also the white paper we cited


15

to Your Honor written in, I believe, 1999, goes into great


16

detail about the relationships between the overseas


17

territories and the United Kingdom, what the authority and


18

sovereignty the United Kingdom has --


19
20
21

QUESTION:

No more established authority like


Blackstone, or --

MS. REID:

Not that we have cited to Your Honor,


22

though in many ways there are parliamentary debates that


23

you can access concerning -- which are referenced in the


24

white papers -- concerning the relationships between the


25

overseas territories and the Queen, which were quite

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reminiscent of the debates before the American Revolution


2

in terms of virtual representation and --


3

QUESTION:

If we were dealing with a private


4

individual rather than a corporation, do you think there


5

could be a stateless person who wouldn't fit under this


6

statute?


7

MS. REID:

In very, very rare instances, and


8

those instances are where the individual had either


9

renounced their citizenship, which has on occasion


10

occurred, or where they have been, you know, exiled, and


11

have not yet acquired citizenship somewhere else, and we


12

would submit that the cases cited by the Matimak Court


13

deal with those kinds of statelessness.


14

QUESTION:

Suppose that kind of person that


15

Justice O'Connor and you just discussed, a true stateless


16

person, is temporarily in a port of Australia, San


17

Francisco, or Monterey, Mexico, can it be said


18

consistently with the statute here in question that they


19

are at least temporarily subject to the laws of Australia


20

while they are there, because they're stateless and they


21

have no other higher obligation, so they're then


22

subject --


23

MS. REID:

No.

I would submit that what subject


24

to you must mean is that you have an allegiance to a


25

sovereign, and the sovereign in turn has an obligation to

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you, including protection.

QUESTION:

It's not subject to.

The phrase is


subject of, isn't it?


4

MS. REID:

Yes, of a --


5

QUESTION:

Everybody living in a country is


6

subject to the laws of that country, and presumably to the


7

Government of that country, but they are not necessarily a


8

subject of that country.


9

MS. REID:

That is true, Your Honor.


10

QUESTION:

So there can be stateless persons who


11

are not within the clause.


12

MS. REID:

Yes.


13

QUESTION:

And the reason you take that


14

position, I take it, is that the impetus for the


15

constitutional grant was in effect to keep countries from


16

getting mad, rather than for purposes of extending


17

jurisdiction as such to everyone who one might want to sue


18

in a Federal court.


19

MS. REID:

Right.

I mean, we have argued that


20

there were two impetuses.

21

foreign entanglements by providing a neutral Federal


22

forum, and the other was the promotion of commerce.


23

QUESTION:

One is the prevention of


I must say, I didn't understand what


24

you mean by foreign entanglements.

Are you talking about


25

the foreign entanglements that George Washington warned us

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

against?


2

MS. REID:

The --


3

QUESTION:

I mean, like alliances with France,


4

or things like that?

5

MS. REID:

What --

No.

The foreign entanglements, when


6

one looks back at the Framers' discussion, seem to


7

envision that if the British debt could not be collected


8

we might find ourselves back in another war.


9

QUESTION:

We don't want to make them mad.


10

MS. REID:

We didn't want to make them mad.


11

QUESTION:

Okay.


12

MS. REID:

That, I think, was the entanglement


13

that they were worried about.


14

QUESTION:

It's a strange term for it, then.


15

MS. REID:

And just briefly on the issue of the


16

promotion of commerce, I wanted to make the point that


17

JPMorgan Chase Bank and the financial market, you know,


18

considered the Matimak decisions as ones who have


19

potentially very deleterious effects on international


20

commerce.


21

QUESTION:

Well, why?

Aren't New York courts --


22

this is not a question of saying for our corporation you


23

can't enter U.S. court.

24

court, and those courts are pretty savvy about commercial


25

matters, are they not?


They can enter a New York State


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. REID:

Absolutely, and I practice before


2

them frequently, but the perception on the part of


3

foreign -- foreigners is that the Federal system is one in


4

which procedures are uniform across the country, and a --


5

with predictability, perhaps, that is more a matter of


6

perception than of reality.


7
8
9

QUESTION:

I know Alabamans who are afraid of


New York courts.

(Laughter.)


10

MS. REID:

And vice versa.


11

QUESTION:

But it is a little different from


12

what it was in the days of the post revolution, when the


13

British creditor said State courts are simply going to let


14

them collect on their debts.


15

MS. REID:

That's true.

In this particular


16

case, the reason in large part that it was decided to go


17

into Federal courts is simply because we wanted to get as


18

speed a resolution as possible, and the State court system


19

has interlocutory appeals, which is just the way the


20

system works, and -- but it does often lead to additional


21

delay and we had noteholders who were insistent that we


22

try and get our collateral back as soon as possible. 


23

QUESTION:

Anyway, you -- I think no one has


24

suggested a dynamic interpretation of 1332, so that if the


25

original rationale is not as strong today as it was then,

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that somehow the meaning of 1332 would change.


2

MS. REID:

No.

I think it's -- the -- clearly


3

the United Kingdom at this point is, I guess one could say


4

at best, annoyed by this continuing refusal to recognize


5

their sovereignty over these types of entities, and the


6

fact is that you know, they have submitted an amicus brief


7

here, several other amicus briefs, two diplomatic notes,


8

so that the fear of the Framers of having an entanglement


9

of some sort with an ally is still, I think, valid today.


10
11

QUESTION:

No other circuit has followed the


Second Circuit, have they?


12

MS. REID:

No.

The Third Circuit has split


13

explicitly.

The Fourth and the Seventh Circuit have also


14

disagreed, though not -- they didn't discuss Matimak, and


15

one of them was earlier than Matimak, but no, there is no


16

other circuit that has followed this rule.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR


2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


3

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


4
5

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


6

The United States submits that corporations


7

organized under the United Kingdom overseas territories


8

are citizens or subjects of a foreign State for purposes


9

of alienage diversity jurisdiction.

We reach that


10

conclusion based on the plain language of 1332.

Section


11

1332's operative term, subject, describes a personal


12

entity that is amenable to foreign authority in the sense


13

that it owes allegiance to that foreign State and is


14

entitled to the protection of that foreign State.

15

term quite clearly embraces a corporation created by a


16

foreign State.

17

Steamship Company v. Tugman 120 years ago.


That


This Court recognized that principle in


18

The crucial issue in this case is whether the


19

United Kingdom exercises sufficient sovereign authority


20

over the British Virgin Islands such that citizens and


21

corporations can be said to be subject to the United


22

Kingdom's rules, and we think the answer to that is


23

clearly yes.

24

United Kingdom's sovereignty over the British Virgin


25

Islands.

The United States expressly recognizes the


We do so through treaties such as the Consulate

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Convention that we have with the United Kingdom.

2

recognize it through our diplomatic relations with the


3

United Kingdom.

4

Kingdom's claim here of sovereignty over the British


5

Virgin Islands.


6

We also


Now, we fully support the United


In addition, if the Court needs to look further,


7

and we think it does not, it's clear from the British


8

Virgin Islands' constitution that the United Kingdom has


9

retained its sovereignty over the British Virgin Islands. 


10

That constitution expressly states that the United Kingdom


11

reserves full power to exercise and pass laws for the good


12

government, order, and peace of the British Virgin


13

Islands.


14

We think the language of section 1332


15

conclusively resolves this case, but if the Court needs to


16

look further still, then we think the policies that


17

underlie section 1332 further buttress the conclusion that


18

we reach.


19

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, what if the -- say, the


20

U.K. takes one position and makes a representation, but


21

the State Department, our State Department disagrees.


22

MR. MINEAR:

23

(Slide.)


24

QUESTION:

25

The --


Then what sort of an action should


our courts take?

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MINEAR:

We think that you should defer on


2

the United States views on these matters.

3

disagreements between the United Kingdom and the United


4

States, that's a matter for the State Department to deal


5

with, but this Court's own decisions, cases such as Jones


6

v. The United States, which is at 137 U.S. 202, explicitly


7

state that questions of sovereignty are political


8

questions that are entrusted to the political branches.


9

QUESTION:

As far as


Well then, if you were to submit the


10

views of the State Department in a case like that, no


11

matter what else there is in the record, we should accept


12

the views of the State Department?


13
14

MR. MINEAR:

Your cases suggest that that is the


result that would follow.


15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, but do you have a position --

Yes, we do.

To answer pointedly,


17

yes, we do believe that you should defer to the United


18

States views, because oftentimes on the question -- let me


19

distinguish here that the question of subject is, of


20

course, the meaning of that term is a legal question that


21

this Court would interpret according to its normal


22

practices, but the question of whether a foreign entity is


23

a foreign State is a question that is properly entrusted


24

to the political branches.


25

We believe that the Second Circuit's decision

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

stands alone here because it is quite plainly wrong.

2

Third Circuit has expressly rejected it, and the Fourth


3

Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have not followed it. 


4

Under these circumstances, we think it is appropriate for


5

the Court to reverse the decision below and remand the


6

case for further proceedings.


7

QUESTION:

8
9

The


Can you comment on the stateless


person problem, not a legal person?

MR. MINEAR:

But an individual.

Yes, we can


10

conceive that there can be such a thing as a stateless


11

person, and we cannot believe that section 1332 by its


12

plain language would reach a person who is not a citizen


13

or a subject of a foreign State.

14

sufficient.

15

is vanishingly small, and as was pointed out in the


16

earlier discussion, the idea of a stateless corporation is


17

an oxymoron, as Judge Altimari had stated.


18

Pure alienage is not


Nevertheless, the class of stateless persons


QUESTION:

But there are some U.S. citizens who


19

don't have access to the Federal court because they're not


20

a citizen of any State.

21

residing in Switzerland.


22

MR. MINEAR:

Let's take a U.S. citizen who is


That is correct.

That is correct,


23

and again, we think the courts have consistently answered


24

these questions by adherence to the plain language of the


25

jurisdictional provisions.

For instance, for many years,

17

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

until Congress dealt with the issue, citizens of the


2

District of Columbia were not entitled to ordinary


3

diversity jurisdiction, but these are matters that we


4

think are best resolved by looking closely at the language


5

that Congress has provided in the jurisdictional


6

provisions.

If there are no further questions, thank you.

There are two statutes at issue here, both of


15

which have plain language.

16

that diversity jurisdiction extends only to citizens or


17

citizens and subjects, and it does not extend to all


18

aliens.

19

persons whom the United Kingdom of Great Britain and


20

Northern Ireland views as its citizens or subjects, and


21

natural persons who are living within the British


22

Dependent Territories do not fall within the category of


23

being British Citizens.


24
25

Section 1332 of title 28 says


The British Nationality Act of 1981 defines those

delegated to those people.

QUESTION:
take it.


7

MR. ALBERT:

8

QUESTION:

9

You're now relying on English law, I


I'm referring to English law, yes.

Yes.

I think that creates some


difficulty for United States courts, particularly when the


10

U.K. is making representations here as to one point, then


11

you tell us we have to read English law, which we're much


12

less familiar with, of course, than American law.


13

MR. ALBERT:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Under Rule


14

44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court can


15

look to any source for finding where --


16

QUESTION:

I realize that.

It's not that we're


17

somehow disqualified from it, but it makes it a much more


18

difficult inquiry.


19

MR. ALBERT:

It would be a much more difficult


20

inquiry had the United Kingdom actually cited to any


21

statute or any case ever decided in any English court


22

anywhere on the subject, but it is --


23

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Albert, even if the British


24

Nationality can be read as saying that corporations formed


25

in the British Virgin Islands are not citizens, it doesn't

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

say they're not subjects of the United Kingdom, does it?

MR. ALBERT:

Well, actually, the British


3

Nationality Act carves out classes of citizens, and


4

classes of subjects, and persons who are neither citizens


5

nor subjects, so in fact it --


6

QUESTION:

I just didn't find anything that


7

indicated to me that a corporation formed in the British


8

Virgin Island was not a subject of the U.K., and we are


9

dealing here with a brief filed by the U.K. that says they


10

are subjects, so what do we --


11

MR. ALBERT:

Well, I think that the question


12

here is whether the deference should be unyielding to a


13

litigation and advocacy position which the British


14

Government puts forth in its briefs versus the substantive


15

basis for that position which one would find in a statute.


16

QUESTION:

Just looking at it from an American,


17

U.S. perspective under the statute, citizens are subjects,


18

and the fact that it is a corporation formed in the


19

British Virgin Islands would lead me to conclude that is a


20

subject of a foreign nation under our own statute.


21

MR. ALBERT:

Respectfully, Justice O'Connor, I


22

think that the conclusion ought to be different, because


23

there is nothing with -- the first step in the inquiry is,


24

what would 1332(a)(2) have to say about corporations, and


25

we know that 1332(a)(2) is a reference to citizens or

Alderson Reporting Company

1

subjects which is consistently -- which before the Letson


2

fiction was adopted had resulted in severe conflict over


3

whether there was jurisdiction for corporations at all.


4

What this Court did in Letson was adopted the


5

fiction not that the corporations were citizens or


6

subjects, but that the corporations would be deemed to be


7

citizens or subjects by virtue of the imputed citizenship


8

of its shareholders and, applying the same principle here,


9

you would impute the citizenship of the -- the citizenship


10

of natural persons resident within the British Virgin


11

Islands to a British Virgin Islands --


12

QUESTION:

That's going back to a law that has


13

long since become obsolete.

14

United States is a citizen of the State in which it's


15

incorporated and where it has its principal place of


16

business.

17

shareholders any more.

18

tremendous disparity between our modern view of what a


19

U.S. corporation is and the rest of the world when we


20

don't even really think of the corporation as an entity in


21

itself but say it's stuck by what its shareholder


22

citizenship is.


23

A corporation within the


We don't look to the citizenship of the


MR. ALBERT:

Why should there be such a


Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg,


24

1332(c) does not say that corporations are citizens of


25

their States.

It says that for purposes of diversity they

21

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

are deemed to be citizens of these States.

2

counting rule, not a citizenship rule, and hence, the


3

Letson fiction still obtains.

4

it adopted the 1332(c) language was to restrict the scope


5

of diversity jurisdiction by providing a second political


6

jurisdiction, principal place of business, which would


7

further limit the number of diversity cases which were


8

appearing in Federal courts.


9

It is a


All that Congress did when


This Court has never held that corporations were


10

political citizens or political subjects.

11

deems them to be so, and taking that a step further, it is


12

Congress' choice, because Congress' language in 1332(a)(2)


13

is that only citizens or subjects -- it does not use the


14

word aliens or anything broader -- are subject to


15

diversity jurisdiction.


16
17
18

QUESTION:

Only 1332(c)


Are you saying those words cover only


human individuals and not corporations?

MR. ALBERT:

For 1332(a)(2), humans, then


19

applying the 1332(c) presumption, that would bring


20

corporations within the scope of diversity jurisdiction.


21
22
23

QUESTION:

Well, 1332(a) does use the term,


aliens at the very end.

MR. ALBERT:

Yes, there is a reference to it,


24

but not in the provision of 1332(a)(2) on the extension of


25

that dispute between citizens of a State and citizens or

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

subjects of a foreign State, and in fact, Mr. Chief


2

Justice, Congress in fact had used the word, aliens, the


3

broader word, in the original enactment, in the Judiciary


4

Act of 1789, but Congress abandoned that language when it


5

revised the statute in 1875.


6

QUESTION:

Is a Spanish corporation -- as I


7

say -- is that -- does that come within 1332 jurisdiction,


8

a corporation formed in Scotland?


9

MR. ALBERT:

In Scotland, yes, because a --


10

because the Scottish people, the English and Welsh people,


11

and the people of Northern Ireland all are citizens of the


12

Metropolitan United Kingdom, the United Kingdom of Great


13

Britain and Northern Ireland.


14

QUESTION:

Well, my problem is if -- take


15

some -- the British Virgin Islands, a place that's still


16

held in something like colonial status, that you say that


17

Scotland, which has a great deal more independence,


18

belongs to the U.K. in the sense that it is a subject of


19

the U.K., but the British Virgin Islands, or the Cayman


20

Islands, that have less independence, are not subjects? 


21

That may be something a lawyer could understand, but I


22

don't think it makes much sense, does it?


23

MR. ALBERT:

I think that the distinction is, no


24

one is disputing here that the British Virgin Islands is


25

subordinate to the United Kingdom, no one is disputing

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that its people ultimately are answerable to the authority


2

of the United Kingdom, but that simply goes --


3
4

QUESTION:

Does it make them subject --


subjects?


5

MR. ALBERT:

Subject to, not subject of, and


6

that is why the British Nationality Act is so important


7

here.


8
9

QUESTION:

If it's so important, I guess then


maybe corporations incorporated in Scotland are not


10

citizens and subjects either, because it doesn't say


11

anything about corporations, does it?


12

MR. ALBERT:

13

QUESTION:

No, Justice Breyer.

Wouldn't people then be surprised if


14

it doesn't say anything, if we said that Scottish


15

corporations weren't citizens, or -- in fact, wouldn't the


16

people who live in these islands be a little surprised if


17

the Supreme Court were to say, you're not nationals?

18

does it work?

19

corporations.


20

How


This is not an act that refers to


MR. ALBERT:

The proper allegation in a case


21

like this would be that a corporation is incorporated


22

under the laws of Scotland and is therefore a citizen or a


23

subject of the United Kingdom.


24
25

QUESTION:

And the reason that they are but


these people aren't is?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ALBERT:

Is because England, Wales,


2

Scotland, and Northern Ireland, along with the Channel


3

Islands, are the constituent parts of the Metropolitan


4

United Kingdom.

5

maintain a direct relationship, and when we treaty with


6

them, we -- our treaties are binding as to that nation and


7

those persons who are within those political subdivisions.


8
9

That is the Government with whom we


QUESTION:

As of English law, the reason that --


although their law says, I guess, the counselor law, the


10

diplomatic manual,the thing that says you have to swear


11

allegiance if you're in the British foreign -- you know,


12

you're in the British Virgin Islands, all the laws are


13

subject to British authority and so forth, so the reason,


14

in your opinion, despite all those things they list in


15

their brief, that makes it very, very similar, the reason


16

that a corporation incorporated in Wales is a citizen of


17

the United Kingdom or subject of the United Kingdom but


18

these are not, because it's the British Virgin Islands,


19

is?


20

MR. ALBERT:

Because when parliament enacts a


21

law of general applicability within the United Kingdom,


22

its applicability is to those four jurisdictions that I've


23

mentioned, England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland,


24

along with in some instances the Channel Islands, but it


25

does not, of its force, extend to the British Overseas

4

They are regulated


When we enter into a treaty with the United


5

Kingdom on any subject whatsoever, unless our treaty


6

specifically extends to those territories, what happens in


7

those territories is unaffected by our treaty, so it is


8

not a two-way street of reciprocal obligations within the


9

United Kingdom.

All of their powers of these


10

jurisdictions are derived from the United Kingdom, but


11

they don't have any reciprocal rights, and that is


12

especially true of the natural people who live within


13

these territories.


14

The natural people who live within these


15

territories have no right of abode within the -- have no


16

right of abode within the Metropolitan United Kingdom.

17

you call them citizens or subjects, and in fact the United


18

19

old concept of subjects, they cannot travel to the United


20

Are they stateless people?

They are not stateless people at


23

all.

They do have a State.

Their State, their


24

overarching State is the United Kingdom, which extends to

The United Kingdom protects them

2

sense they a State.


3

QUESTION:

4

They are British -- their State is


the U.K.?


5

MR. ALBERT:

They are just -- they are very


6

similar to what our territorial residents would have been


7

before we extended citizenship.


8
9

QUESTION:

They are subject of and to the United


States, I assume, the residents in the U.S. Territories.


10

MR. ALBERT:

11

now citizens by virtue of an amendment to the Immigration


12

and --


13
14
15

QUESTION:

What were they before they were


citizens?

MR. ALBERT:

16

They had no status.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ALBERT:

19

QUESTION:

They were nationals and natives. 

They were very much --

They were not stateless, were they?

No, they were not.

And so why isn't a corporation


20

organized in the British Virgin Islands or the Cayman


21

Islands -- why is that stateless?

22

it can belong to, because these are not independent


23

sovereigns.

What State does that -- you tell me that the individual


25

would belong to the U.K.

There's only one State

I do not advocate the position that

the Matimak -- the Matimak Court adopted that these

corporations were stateless.

5

essential to the determination below, and I think that it


6

was a poor choice of words.

7

The United Kingdom granted to the British Virgin Islands


8

the authority to adopt a Companies Act, just as United


9

States territories have authority under statute of


I do not think that that is


There is a State involved. 


10

Congress to adopt their own incorporation laws.

11

not mean that the corporations that are incorporated


12

within the British Virgin Islands are subjects of, rather


13

than subject to --


14

QUESTION:

That does


They belong to some State, and either


15

they belong to the U.K., or they belong to something that


16

isn't a sovereign, or they're stateless.

17

one of those three, so which is it?


18

MR. ALBERT:

It's got to be


They belong to the United Kingdom,


19

but that does not answer the statutory question at issue


20

here, because even if they belong to a kingdom, even if


21

they belong to the United Kingdom, that does not make the


22

citizens or subjects of the kingdom.

23

and subject -- an alien to the United States, subject to


24

the kingdom, yet not be a citizen or subject of the United


25

really, were they?


13

(Laughter.)


14

MR. ALBERT:

If they


The laughter from the audience in


15

fact focuses the point here, because that was the


16

fundamental shift in the understanding of the colonists


17

and their relationship to the British Government.

18

the Revolution, the old idea of subjectship was that it


19

was permanent.

20

The political idea during the Revolution was a shift


21

toward the idea of volitional allegiance.


22

Before


One could never abandon one's subjectship. 


That is, that once the Crown abdicated parts of


23

its protective authority, then the people no longer were


24

subjects of the Crown, and the legal basis for the legal

philosophers during the formation -- in the 1774 to 1776

period was to justify how it was that we could throw off


2

our bonds to the British Crown, and the way in which they


3

justified it was to say that the King had abdicated, and

therefore, in the words of the Declaration of


5

Independence, we were no longer his subjects.

Oh, we had been.

days as the British --

comparable to the status of citizens in the Virgin Islands

Justice --

-- because they're not claiming that


they've been abandoned by the Crown here.

MR. ALBERT:

Justice Stevens, there are two


18

places in which that abandonment can come about.

19

by the people themselves declaring themselves independent,


20

they saying that those bonds have been thrown off.


21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ALBERT:

One is


Of course, that hasn't happened here.

It certainly has not happened here,


23

but there is another way, because when nations adopt the


24

idea of volitional allegiance, the new idea of what a


25

subject is, then the nation itself can change its laws to

Alderson Reporting Company

3

United Kingdom has moved away from that 18th and 16th,


4

17th century view of what a subject is and moved to our


5

view of what a subject is, and the British Nationality Act


6

explains exactly what these people are.

QUESTION:

15

so I'm cutting you off, but they say that in these places

17

responsible for internal security, public service, and


18

court administration, but all the laws they pass in these


19

places are subject to review by the Foreign Office, the


20

Commonwealth Office, and then the Queen in Council, which


21

is a group of particular individuals, that the Legislative

MR. ALBERT:

Or more particularly, as we would

treat one of our territories, because the ability of

QUESTION:

They don't owe their allegiance to

the United States, and they're not subject to its laws. 


14

The position that has been

advocated here, and I think that the -- and that has been


17

uniformly advanced by the scholars is that citizenship


18

versus subjectship is simply -- are simply two sides of


19

the same coin determin -- describing what the relationship


20

is of one in either a democracy or a monarchy, and what


21

has happened in the United Kingdom is that as the country


22

has evolved from a strict monarchy to a constitutional


23

monarchy with democratic principles, that the ideas of


24

subjectship have evolved, and the idea of citizenship has


25

been incorporated into their law.

standing before the Court as an interpreter of U.K. law.

I would have thought that had the


United Kingdom had a statute on which it could rely, or


10

any decision on which it could rely, it would cite them. 


11

The only authority to which it cites in the record at all


12

is in the lodging --


13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ALBERT:

Which -- go ahead.

Is in the lodging at page L31, an


15

excerpt from its diplomatic manual which describes the


16

various categories under the British Nationality Act.


17

The other authority upon which it relies are its


18

diplomatic notes in which it asserts that it views these


19

people as its subjects, but if you look to each citation


20

of that -- those diplomatic notes, they come not in a


21

submission to a court, asking a court to determine what


22

British law is, but in a protest to the State Department


23

after a case has been decided saying, we don't like the


24

decision of this court.

to the text of the British Nationality Act which tells you

where the diplomatic -- where the diplomatic manual

derives its basis.

a litigating position and therefore we do not owe it

Chevron deference?

position, and it does not deserve --


9

QUESTION:

Are you arguing for what we might


10

call a variable definition of subject, that VI residents


11

are subjects of Great Britain in some cases and not


12

others?


13

That is to say, you said earlier that the U.K.


14

could make a treaty binding on VI residents, VI citizens,


15

so that you can be subject of Great Britain in some


16

instances and not others.

way, would that be a proper characterization of your

argument?

have to inquire as to whether or not a person is or is not

I'll give you an example.

The


They are subjects because of the


potential of the exercise of that power.

MR. ALBERT:

The land that sits in the middle of


16

London at Leicester Square, the famous Tolk v. Moxie Land,


17

is subject to the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, but


18

that does not make the land a subject, and so the mere


19

fact that the United Kingdom adopts legislation which


20

regulates behavior of its people, both within the


21

metropolitan United Kingdom and within its territories,


22

does not mean that the people within its territories are


23

subjects for purposes of 1332, and I say that especially


24

in light of the fact that as we stand here today the


25

United Kingdom has adopted a new statute which has not yet

come into force, because a statutory instrument has not


2

yet been signed for it, which will render the British


3

Territories' citizens to be British citizens, giving those


4

British citizens now the right of abode within the United


5

Kingdom, and that will happen in the future.

6

will happen soon, maybe in a matter of months, maybe in a


7

matter of years, but it has not happened yet, and we


8

determine subject matter jurisdiction as of the time of


9

the commencement of --


10

QUESTION:

It probably


How does that affect a corporation? 


11

You're talking about what will be the status of


12

individuals.


13

MR. ALBERT:

I think that a -- that applying --


14

that the proper way to apply the Letson principle here is


15

that a British Virgin Islands Corporation should never be


16

subject to diversity jurisdiction precisely because the


17

presumption is that its shareholders have opted for


18

British Virgin Islands status rather than opted for


19

British status.


20

QUESTION:

And that would be the case -- it


21

would be -- the Congress would be immobile as well.

22

order to make -- if I follow your argument correctly, in


23

order to make a BVI corporation subject to 1332


24

jurisdiction, there would have to be a constitutional


25

amendment, because the Constitution uses the same words

In

QUESTION:

The Second Circuit did not reach


That's what I'm putting to you,


5

because the statute uses the same term, citizens or


6

subjects.


7

MR. ALBERT:

I do not think that there is a


8

presumption in this Court that the use of the same


9

language in Article 3 and in title 28 means that the


10

statute has --


11

QUESTION:

Well, tell me what subject means


12

within Article 3 that it doesn't mean within 1332 and why


13

a court should interpret it -- interpret them differently.


14

MR. ALBERT:

Because if you look to the


15

Judiciary Act of 1789, which was adopted nearly


16

contemporaneously, Congress used the broader language,


17

alien, rather than the narrower language, citizen or


18

subject, and --


19

QUESTION:

That's not -- the Constitution says


20

citizen or subject, doesn't it?


21

MR. ALBERT:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct, it does, and --

What does it mean -- what does


23

subject mean within the Constitution, within Article 3, as


24

it reads?


25

MR. ALBERT:

It would be mere speculation on my

37

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

part to suggest what it was that they meant, since this


2

was one of the least debated provisions of the


3

Constitution.


4

QUESTION:

But you're urging a certain statutory


5

interpretation, and you said, well, maybe it has a


6

different meaning, the word subject, in the Constitution,


7

so I'm asking you to tell me what could be those different


8

meanings.


9

MR. ALBERT:

I think that it is entirely


10

possible that in 1787 Congress -- the Convention intended


11

to extend the grant of authority to the full measure of


12

diversity jurisdiction over cases involving all


13

foreigners, but the reason that I don't think that they


14

focused on the issue was because in 1787 there really were


15

not these cases of -- there were not a lot of cases,


16

probably no cases in which there were people who lacked


17

subjectship yet nevertheless were foreigners.


18

With respect to these trading colonies in


19

particular, the people who were involved in the mercantile


20

trade involving these Caribbean colonies were not people


21

who were resident within those colonies --


22

QUESTION:

What about Canadians?

Until Canada


23

domesticated its constitution, I suppose for most of the


24

19th Century Canadians were not subjects of the Crown?


25

MR. ALBERT:

I think Canadians were subjects of

38

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the Crown by virtue of the fact that they were in a


2

settler colony rather than in a plantation, a plantation


3

colony, and the -- one of the difficulties of the British


4

law of that entire era is that it never really had a


5

uni -- it never had a uniform picture of who its persons


6

were, and what the relationship was between the Crown and


7

each one of the different types of colonies that were


8

created, and it was very, very difficult for the -- it was


9

very difficult for Britain, because Britain had different


10

types of colonies which promoted different types of


11

British interests, and therefore it created different


12

types of Governments within them, and created different


13

statuses with respect to immigration and migration to


14

Europe for those people.


15

QUESTION:

So among the subjects, or -- well,


16

the entities that are under U.K. sovereignty, which are


17

those are subjects and which of them are not?


18

MR. ALBERT:

The ones which are certainly not


19

subjects right now are those which are the British


20

Overseas Territories, which include the British Virgin


21

Islands, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Turks and


22

Caicos --

not.

MS. REID:

Right.

I think he may have

In terms of the natural citizens, I just wanted


23

to point -- the British Nationality Act, of course, has no


24

applications to corporations, and the analysis that


25

somehow we should adopt the old Letson rule is

41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

inapplicable both because it's United Kingdom law, we have


2

no learning -- I mean, United States law, no learning on


3

what -- how the United Kingdom would do it, but it seems


4

sensible to adopt the more modern view, but the 1981


5

Nationality Act, interestingly, in schedule 5 to section


6

41, in terms of naturalization and becoming a citizen or a


7

British Overseas Citizen, or a British, what was then


8

known as Dependent Territory citizen, you're required to


9

take the following oath of allegiance:

I, name, swear by


10

Almighty God that on becoming a British Dependent


11

Territory citizen I will be faithful and bear true


12

allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs


13

and successors, according to law.


14

I submit to you that that is the definition of a


15

subject, and of allegiance, and that really is --


16

demonstrates that the United Kingdom has come before this


17

Court not as a litigation posture, because it has no


18

interest really in any of these cases, but as a concern


19

over the fact that its sovereignty is not being recognized


20

by the judiciary when it has been recognized by the United


21

States Government in numerous treaties, and again, I won't


22

read them, but I would simply refer you to the Consular


23

Convention and footnote 17 of the United Kingdom's brief,

25
