 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

this morning in case 13316, Loughrin v. United States. 

5

 Mr. Russell. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 This case presents the question whether to 

11

commit Federal bank fraud, the defendant must intend to 

12

defraud a bank, or whether, as the Tenth Circuit held, 

13

it's enough that the defendant intended to defraud 

14

someone in order to obtain money the victim keeps in a 

15

bank account.  Applying the Tenth Circuit's 

16

interpretation, the government has prosecuted people 

17

whose only relationship to a bank is that they tricked a 

18

third party into issuing them a perfectly valid check, 

19

which the defendant then cashed at a bank. 

20

 Such a broad interpretation of the Federal 

21

bank fraud statute threatens to sweep in a garden 

22

variety State law crime  a broad sweep of the sort 

23

that this Court has refused to give to Federal criminal 

24

statutes absent a clear statement of congressional 

25

intent.  And that 

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it fits ­ it fits the 

2

words Congress used, "obtained funds owned or controlled 

3

by financial  a financial institution by means of 

4

false representation." 

5

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, the problem is there is 

6

an ambiguity in Subsection 2 about to whom the false 

7

representation must be directed.  Now, I acknowledge 

8

that ordinarily, you would construe that silence in 

9

favor of breadth that  in favor breadth that a false 

10

statement to anyone would do.  But there are compelling 

11

reasons not to give that ambiguity, that interpretation 

12

in this case. 

13

 And one is the breadth that I mentioned. 

It 

14

enabled the government to bring cases like United States 

15

v. Rodriguez where the government prosecuted a 

16

bookkeeper who filed false invoices with her employer 

17

that led the employer then to issue perfectly valid 

18

checks to people who didn't do the work. 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but the 

20

breadth is confined  given the development of the 

21

banking system, it may not seem as significant a 

22

limitation today as in years past.  But, nonetheless, 

23

the definition of a financial institution is  in 

24

18 U.S.C. 20 is limited to institutions with a 

25

particular Federal nexus.  Federal Deposit Insurance,

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Federal Home Loan Bank, Small Business Investment Act. 

2

It isn't any financial institution, but institutions in 

3

which the Federal Government has a particular interest. 

4

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's true.  But nonetheless, 

5

for precisely the reason you identified, it  it covers 

6

an awful lot of banks.  And if you read the statute 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But not in this case, 

8

and that's where I'm having difficulty.  Why is it 

9

illogical to think that a falsehood rendered through a 

10

third party that might affect a bank, a false check, as 

11

your client was charged with, that that would be the 

12

very case Congress would have wanted covered? 

13

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So that's a question about, I 

14

think, whether intent to defraud a bank could be 

15

satisfied in a case like this.  And I think that the 

16

answer to that is possibly it could.  So the government, 

17

I think, tries to put you to a false choice between 

18

saying you either have to accept the Tenth Circuit's 

19

interpretation that sweeps in cases like United States 

20

v. Rodriguez, perfectly valid checks that don't 

21

implicate either of the core interests in a bank fraud 

22

case, which is protecting the bank from financial harm 

23

or protecting the bank from being lied to.  You either 

24

have to accept that or you have to leave unprosecutable 

25

cases like this one.  But that's not true.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

How would that  how would 

2

that work?  Would the jury have to be instructed about 

3

the U.C.C. and be asked to determine whether the bank or 

4

Target, in this case, would be liable for the funds if 

5

the bank had honored a forged check? 

6

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So that gets the  we have 

7

two theories.  We have the theory that intent to defraud 

8

a bank is required and under that theory, the U.C.C. 

9

doesn't matter.  We also argue, though, if you don't 

10

require intent to defraud a bank 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Why would it not matter? 
Because under the 

13

government  it doesn't matter under the government's 

14

view or ours, so 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, under your view.  Under 

16

your view that there has to be an intent to defraud a 

17

bank.  Why would it not matter from  who would 

18

ultimately be liable for the  for the money  for the 

19

amount of the check? 

20

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Under our view, all the 

21

government has to show is that the defendant intended to 

22

deceive a bank in order to obtain property that is owned 

23

by or in the custody of a bank.  So in a bank account. 

24

So a traditional altered check case 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think on anybody's

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

theory, you  you have to show that  that the monies, 

2

funds, credits, assets, securities or other property was 

3

owned by or under the custody or control of the 

4

financial institution. 

5

 MR. RUSSELL: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7
8
9
10
11
12
13

That's right. 
Doesn't either side have to 

prove that? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's correct.  So the point 

of departure is to whom the false statement has to be 
directed. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but the jury has to 

be instructed that the money's coming out of the bank. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's correct.  That's 

14

correct.  And so that's  to the extent you think the 

15

U.C.C. is implicated in that inquiry, that  that is 

16

true under either one.  I don't think that it is.  I 

17

think it's just going to be a question of, you know, 

18

whose money are you trying to get and is it in a bank 

19

account. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Two of the  two of the 

21

six checks involved were paid by the drawing bank. 

22

Isn't that so? 

23

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That is correct.  And so 

24

but under our principal view that the problem here is 

25

that the government  that the jury wasn't instructed

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that Petitioner had to intend to defraud a bank as 

2

opposed to Target.  And so it doesn't matter whether the 

3

checks were cashed or not.  And it doesn't even matter 

4

under the risk of loss theory because it only has to be 

5

a risk of loss, not an actual loss. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I think you have a  you 

7

have a credible textual argument, but you run into the 

8

problem that your interpretation makes Section 

9

Subsection 1 surplusage.  How do you get around that? 

10

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't know that we do, but 

11

the Tenth Circuit's interpretation doesn't either, 

12

because under the Tenth Circuit's interpretation, one is 

13

rendered surplusage because any prosecution that could 

14

be brought under (1) could also be brought under (2). 

15

If it's enough under (2) that you intend to defraud 

16

someone, it's surely enough that you intended to defraud 

17

a bank. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, under the alternative, 

19

there is certainly overlap, but (2) reaches a much 

20

broader category or it reaches a broader category.  So 

21

it's not useless. 

22

 MR. RUSSELL: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, that's true.  And 
Representation doesn't have 

24

to be made to the bank under (2).  (2) covers those 

25

instances where the representation is made to somebody

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

else.  (1) would be limited to those, perhaps, in which 

2

the representation is made to the bank.  But under your 

3

interpretation where (2) requires that the 

4

representation be made to the bank, there is no point in 

5

having two subsections.  You might as well just have 

6

one. 

7

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I have two things to say 

8

to that.  One is Congress may have thought that what 

9

they were doing in (2) is making clear that the statute 

10

encompasses the broad range of particular kinds of 

11

property interests that are unique or  or at least 

12

common in the banking context.  And in that way it 

13

serves the same function as the second clause in the 

14

mail fraud statute upon which this statute is premised. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It doesn't have the two 

16

subparts.  But here you are essentially asking us to 

17

read the word "or," "(1) or (2)" to mean (1) including 

18

(2). 

19

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, that's the same way that 

20

this Court has repeatedly read the two parallel clauses 

21

of the bank fraud statute.  The only difference being, 

22

you know, the difference in hardware terms and numerals. 

23

But I don't think 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What this Court did 

after the  after  or before this statute  this

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute was passed before the Court's interpretation of 

2

the mail fraud statute. 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's right. 
Every court that had 

5

looked at it at the time the statute was passed had 

6

determined there were two separate provisions.  So why 

7

would Congress have any reason to believe they were 

8

passing a singular case, a singular charge? 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think what Congress would 

10

have intended is simply that when it uses the 

11

identical  materially identical language and structure 

12

in two statutes, that they would have the same meaning 

13

as determined by this Court. 

14

 The interpretive principle that the 

15

government relies on that identicallyworded statutes 

16

can mean very different things depending on the state of 

17

the circuit law at the time Congress copies the language 

18

is really untenable.  And it requires a criminal 

19

defendant, for example, to know what that circuit 

20

precedent was and not be able to simply rely on this 

21

Court's decisions interpreting the identical language in 

22

another statute. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it's not identical 

24

because in the bank fraud statute, Congress broke out 

25

and separately numbered (1) and (2) and they didn't do

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that in the mail fraud. 

2

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Now, I understand that.  But I 

3

don't think that if Congress intended this statute to 

4

operate dramatically different from the mail fraud 

5

statute, the only change it would have made was as those 

6

sort of typographical changes.  I don't think that's the 

7

way Congress conveys that kind of intent. 

8

 But again, even if you think that Subsection 

9

(2) creates an independent offense, it's susceptible of 

10

the interpretation that we give you, which avoids having 

11

to federalize the kinds of cases that are at issue in 

12

United States v. Rodriguez. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

One understanding of what 

14

led to this statute is this Court's decision in Maze, 

15

which actually seems on all fours with this case, right? 

16

Use of a fraudulent credit card to a merchant who then 

17

asks for money from the bank.  Essentially the same case 

18

as this with a fraudulent credit card as opposed to a 

19

fraudulent check.  So if we understand this statute as 

20

arising from Congress's desire to make that bank fraud, 

21

why should we rule for you here? 

22

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I guess I have to just 

23

dispute the premise.  I think Congress was reacting to 

24

the rule, the principle of law that Maze adopted, which 

25

made it impossible to use the wire fraud statute and

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mail fraud statute to prosecute a case even when 

2

somebody goes into a bank and cashes a counterfeit check 

3

because the then use of the mail to settle the account 

4

afterwards wasn't good enough.  And that's what Congress 

5

was concerned of. 

6

 In this Court's own decision in Maze, the 

7

Court noted that Congress had dealt with the specific 

8

factual problem in Maze through an amendment, then 

9

recent amendment to the TruthinLending Act, which 

10

prohibited credit card fraud.  Congress added to those 

11

remedies in another section of the same statute that 

12

enacted the bank fraud statute and then dealt with the 

13

parallel problem with respect to altered checks in 

14

Section 513, which is also part of that same statute, which 

15

criminalizes any use of an altered check to deceive 

16

anyone without regard to whose property the defendant is 

17

intending to obtain. 

18

 So when you're worried about altered check 

19

cases here, and we need to not just be worried about 

20

these cases because this decision will implicate a whole host 

21

of other cases.  But if you're thinking just about 

22

altered check cases, Congress dealt with altered check 

23

cases in Section 513.  And that's important because the 

24

penalties under 513 and 31  and the bank fraud 

25

provision are very different.  It's a 30year sentence

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for bank fraud and a 10year sentence for a Section 513. 

2

And more importantly, the bank fraud statute is a 

3

predicate for aggravated identity theft, which imposes a 

4

mandatory 2year minimum sentence that must be served 

5

consecutive to any other sentence. 

6

 And so in a petty case like this, the 

7

difference between somebody being charged for the bank fraud 

8

and being charged under 513 for a firsttime offender 

9

can be the difference between zero to 6 months and 2 to 

10

2 and a half years.  And that gives the government 

11

enormous plea bargaining leverage.  So you can 

12

understand why the government wants a broad 

13

interpretation here. 

14

 But it's also equally understandable that 

15

Congress would have thought that cases in which 

16

somebody's using an altered check in a way that 

17

negligently or knowingly poses some risk to a bank is 

18

warrants less punishment than when somebody directly 

19

targets the bank itself for deception in order to obtain 

20

bank property. 

21
22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Why  why is that?  Why 

would Congress have wanted to make that difference? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, because I think 

Congress 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I agree with you that the

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

disparity in  in punishment is quite substantial. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Yeah.  I think that Congress 

3

would have thought it's more serious for somebody to 

4

target a bank than it is for somebody to use an altered 

5

check that has a risk to a bank.  Because as this case 

6

illustrates, using an altered check doesn't necessarily 

7

impose a financial cost on the bank.  Here Target 

8

intercepted most  most  we have a disagreement with 

9

the government whether it was three or four of the 

10

checks, but  and the bank itself made  discovered 

11

the alteration and refused to honor the check.  But when 

12

you are intending to defraud the bank, that's  the 

13

Congress could think that's a much more serious thing. 

14

And I do think that, you know 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It does  it does seem to 

16

me that this case can be distinguished from the example 

17

you gave in your yellow brief of the person that sells a 

18

magazine subscription and he gets the check and he never 

19

intends to deliver the magazines.  In that case, the 

20

bank will  will honor the check, I assume. 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEY: 

23

 MR. RUSSELL: 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

Yes. 
And must.  And must do so. 
That's correct.  And so 
And that's quite different 

than this case.

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So the question is how to get 

2

rid of those cases while preserving the government's 

3

ability to prosecute. 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, you can do so, I 

5

suppose, through the government's proposed fallback 

6

position. 

7

 MR. RUSSELL: 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9
10

Yes. 
 at page 40 of its brief 

which talks about a risk of loss. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

So there are  there are 

11

several things wrong with the government's fallback 

12

position and it leads in most cases to the same result 

13

as intent to defraud.  So in paradigmatic bank fraud 

14

cases, both our rule and their fallback rule permits 

15

prosecution. 

16

 The only real difference is that their rule 

17

is  is designed to permit prosecution in thirdparty 

18

check fraud cases like ours.  Because if it's an altered 

19

check that's presented to the bank, we acknowledge that 

20

shows intent to defraud the bank.  So we're only talking 

21

about cases like ours where an altered check is 

22

presented to a third party and the government's rule 

23

permits them to continue to prosecute those cases. 

24
25

 Now, even if you agree with them that those 
kinds of cases fall within the scope of the statute,

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that  all you need to do then is to say, look, those 

2

cases aren't materially different than when you submit 

3

the check to the bank in the first place, that the 

4

altered check shows intent to defraud the bank in 

5

thirdparty cases just like it does in a firstparty 

6

case.  Now, we think that they're wrong about whether or 

7

not these kinds of cases are covered.  And if we're 

8

right about that, then there's obviously no reason to 

9

adopt, you know, a rule that they made up just to deal 

10
11
12
13

with those kinds of cases. 
 And maybe I could turn to that argument just 
for a second. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, could I ask you this 

14

question?  Suppose the defendant testifies and suppose 

15

the jury believes the defendant.  The defendant 

16

testifies as follows:  I never intended to defraud the 

17

bank.  I knew that the cashiers at this particular 

18

retail establishment were incredibly careful  careless 

19

and so I got these checks and they were made out to my 

20

neighbor John Doe.  I stole them from his mailbox.  I 

21

crossed out his name and I wrote in the name of the 

22

retail establishment and I knew these cashiers were so 

23

careless that they would honor the check.  However, I 

24

never thought any bank would do that.  So I didn't 

25

intend to defraud the bank.  I intended to defraud the

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

retail establishment. 

2

 Now, under your theory that  that if the 

3

jury believed that, the person would not be guilty of 

4

the offense. 

5

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's right.  And I don't 

6

think that those cases are covered for an additional 

7

reason as well.  And that is, the fraud there is not 

8

intended to obtain bank property.  Under Subsection (2), 

9

it's not any fraud that implicates bank property.  The 

10

object of the fraud must be to obtain the property that 

11

is owned by or in the custody or control of the  of 

12

the bank. 

13

 And in a case like this, what my client 

14

obtained was DVD players and groceries and a printer, 

15

and those were not property owned by or in the custody 

16

or control of the bank. 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, why doesn't that 

principle cover most of the cases you're worried about? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, it doesn't cover the 

20

cases like Rodriguez, because the government can argue 

21

there that  so, I don't know if I've finished the 

22

description of Rodriguez, but in that case, a bookkeeper 

23

submitted false invoices to her employer.  The employer 

24

issued valid checks to a third party, who then cashed 

25

it.  And the government can say in a case like that,

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cashing the check results in you obtaining money in the 

2

custody or control of the bank.  That's what you get in 

3

exchange for the check.  And you obtained it by means of 

4

a false statement to someone, i.e., the false invoice 

5

submitted to the employer.  And so it doesn't 

6

adopting our view of what bank property is doesn't 

7

completely eliminate the problem.  We would win the 

8

case.  But it doesn't 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why  why wouldn't your 

view have enabled you to win this case? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

It would  it should have.  I 

12

mean, we've brought a sufficiency of the evidence 

13

challenge with respect to whether  whose property this 

14

is.  And the jury 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So if we think that was 

16

wrong, there's a lot less to this case than meets the 

17

eye. 

18

 MR. RUSSELL: 

There is  that could be the 

19

end of this case.  It doesn't resolve the circuit 

20

conflict, which there is still a circuit conflict about 

21

whether intent to defraud a bank is required in cases 

22

not involving this circumstance of a third party. 

23

 But we do think that you shouldn't believe 

24

that just because  if you agree with the government 

25

that thirdparty altered check cases fall within the

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

scope of the statute, that's not a reason to forego 

2

requiring the government to prove intent to defraud the 

3

bank.  It's just a reason to say that, as a number of 

4

circuits have, that use of that altered check shows 

5

intent to defraud a bank. 

6

 The government has been able to prosecute 

7

altered check cases, including altered thirdparty 

8

check  altered check cases to third parties, in 

9

circuits that require intent to defraud the bank. 

10

 The other thing that's wrong 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

What's the theory behind 

12

that?  Why would presenting an altered check to a third 

13

party constitute sufficient evidence of intent to 

14

defraud a bank? 

15

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I think the theory is 

16

that the use of an altered check shows intent to deceive 

17

the bank.  And then these courts simply view obtaining 

18

the property of a third party using that check as 

19

materially identical to obtaining that property directly 

20

from a bank, I think is the theory. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Usually there won't be 

22

evidence, direct evidence of the defendant's intent.  So 

23

the defendant's intent will be inferred from objective 

24

evidence  will be inferred from other evidence, and 

25

then you will get into the question of whether the

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

retailer who initially accepts the check or the bank is 

2

ultimately going to be liable for the amount of that 

3

check.  If you're  if you're in a situation in which 

4

the  the retailer is going to be liable, that  maybe 

5

that supports the  the inference that the defendant 

6

never intended to defraud the bank.  If you're in a 

7

situation where the bank is going to be liable, it 

8

supports the inference that the defendant intended to 

9

defraud the bank. 

10

 So won't you get into this somewhat 

11

complicated UCC question about who is ultimately going 

12

to be liable for the amount?  I think that's a problem 

13

with your argument, but maybe there's an answer to it. 

14

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I think that there is 

15

and maybe I'm not explaining it very well.  So there's 

16

two pieces of intent to defraud the bank.  There's 

17

intent to deceive the bank and intent thereby to obtain 

18

bank property.  With respect to intent to deceive the 

19

bank, I think the courts have uniformly found in  in 

20

cases, at least first party cases, that use of an 

21

altered check is sufficient evidence to show that you 

22

intend to deceive the bank.  And when you intend 

23

whether you intend to deceive the bank, it doesn't 

24

matter who's going to end up bearing the cost at the 

25

end.  It's just a question 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Doesn't  doesn't that 

2

U.C.C. question arise anyway under the requirement that 

3

you have to  you have to obtain bank property? 

4
5
6

 MR. RUSSELL: 

It  it potentially does if 

you're willing to 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Doesn't it require you to 

7

ultimately decide who's  who's going to be stuck with 

8

the  with the empty bag? 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

It  it potentially could if 

10

you're willing to say that somebody who obtains property 

11

from Target potentially is obtaining bank property 

12

because of reasons relating to the U.C.C.  We don't 

13

think you even need to go that far.  We think it's 

14

sufficient to say that in these thirdparty cases, what 

15

you're obtaining is the property of somebody else.  And 

16

that doesn't mean that it's not a crime, and it doesn't 

17

even mean that it's not a Federal crime.  It simply 

18

means it's a Section 513 crime. 

19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I understand that.  But 

but if you accept the government's view 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
 of how these thirdparty 

23

cases ought to  ought to be resolved, you have to get 

24

into the U.C.C., don't you. 

25

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't know.  I mean, maybe

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they can  they're the better people to answer that 

2

question for you.  But I think that, at least to finish 

3

the answer to Justice Alito, use of an altered check 

4

which says  when you've written, you know, your name 

5

on the check rather than the person who authored it, is 

6

an attempt to deceive a bank.  We don't disagree with 

7

that. 

8
9

 And so then the question in these 
thirdparty cases is:  Are you attempting to obtain 

10

property of the bank?  And we don't think that the 

11

U.C.C. comes into that.  It's just a simple common sense 

12

thing that a DVD player on Target's shelves is not 

13

property owned by or in the custody or control of a 

14

bank.  And so 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

How does it work  how 

16

does it work if you have Mr. Crook, Mr. Crook has a bank 

17

account at Bank of America, he has $32 in it.  He writes 

18

a check for 5,000.  He sees somebody on the street whom 

19

he vaguely knows and says, here, take my check; go to 

20

the bank; give me $200 or give me 1,000.  Now, he's got 

21

the money from Mr. Smith.  He didn't obtain money from 

22

the bank.  It was Mr. Smith who did or did not go into 

23

the bank to get the money.  Does that fall within the 

24

statute? 

25

 MR. RUSSELL: 

No.  I mean, what that is is a

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

typical bad check case.  It's the equivalent 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So this doesn't fall within the 

3

statute at all.  In fact  in other words, have we got 

4

some cases on that? 

5
6
7

 MR. RUSSELL: 

We don't have this Court's 

cases.  I mean 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no.  This is not good, 

8

but I mean, you know, what you tried  you didn't get 

9

the money from the bank.  What you did was just write a 

10

false check, knowing that in all likelihood the guy you 

11

give the check to is going to go right to the bank and 

12

get the money.  Now, I just wonder is there some 

13

authority as to whether that falls within these statutes 

14

or not. 

15

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So the government has brought 

16

those kinds of notsufficientfunds cases.  Ordinarily, 

17

it goes down somewhat differently, that you've presented 

18

the check that you know is going to bounce to a 

19

merchant, not to some guy in the street.  And the 

20

government's theory is that thereby you're obtaining 

21

bank property.  But most of the cases say that that's 

22

not actually bank fraud because you're not intending to 

23

deceive a bank.  And that's perfectly fine. 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It wouldn't matter.  Look, 

I don't think you have to  when you say "intend,"

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"intend" can encompass a known but undesired consequence 

2

of an intentional act.  And so you may not care  you 

3

couldn't care less when the money comes from the bank or 

4

not, but you know that the bank is likely to pay it. 

5

 MR. RUSSELL: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But 
So therefore, you have the 

7

requisite intent.  But what I'm trying to figure out 

8

here is what's the case law on what should be a very 

9

common situation.  If you give it to a third party, your 

10

fake check, insufficient funds.  You just want the money 

11

from the third party.  But you know the bank is likely 

12

to honor it. 

13

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, if  if I can quibble 

14

with that last piece of the sentence.  Ordinarily, if 

15

you give a check that goes to a bank and there's not 

16

sufficient funds, they bounce the check.  They don't 

17

honor it.  So 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Try two 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's certainly been my 

20

experience. 

21

 (Laughter.) 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Try two  two different 

23

paths here.  Path A, he believes that the bank will 

24

honor Smith's, his check, when presented by Jones.  I 

25

got my names mixed up.

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. RUSSELL: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Sure. 
Mr. Crook believes that the 

3

bank will honor his check when Mr. Smith presents it. 

4

And the second is the one Justice Scalia said, is being 

5

sophisticated about these matters, Mr. Crook believes 

6

that the bank will never own  never, never pay the 

7

check when presented by Smith.  I just want to know the 

8

state of the law on those two situations. 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So the state of the law  and 

10

there's only a handful of these notsufficientfund 

11

cases is that most of the circuits have said they do not 

12

fall within the statute.  The ones that have said that 

13

they do, it's usually because the defendant has some 

14

told some additional lie to the bank.  They've opened 

15

the account under a false name, for example.  And so 

16

that's the state of law. 

17
18
19
20

 This Court in United States v. Williams, 
though, said we should go to great lengths 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
those courts? 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23
24
25

What is the thinking of 

What's that? 
What's the thinking of 

those courts?  What's the rationale? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

So the rationale is that in a 

case where you submit  I guess they have two.  Some of

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

them are applying the risk of loss test and say that 

2

there's not a sufficient risk of loss.  I believe some 

3

of them are saying that there's no intent to defraud the 

4

bank there because the target of the fraud 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And the courts don't 

6

hold this way, but hold, as the court did below, that 

7

it's an intent to deceive anyone so long as the scheme 

8

is 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Yeah.  Those  I don't know 

10

that this case has come up in those circuits, but I 

11

think the answer is quite clear that those circuits 

12

would say they're covered.  But in United States v. 

13

Williams, this Court said we should go to great lengths 

14

to avoid interpreting a Federal criminal statute to 

15

criminalize Federally every insufficient funds check 

16

case. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You come back to those 

18

general statements, you do have the language of the 

19

statutes which favors you this question.  But I guess 

20

the theory would simply be where Mr. Crook gives him a 

21

bad check, to Mr. Smith, he couldn't care less whether 

22

Smith presents it to the bank, and he, as far as he's 

23

fairly sophisticated, thinks probably Smith won't 

24

present it to the bank.  He may to an insurance company 

25

or something and, therefore, he did not either obtain or

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

try to obtain or believe he would obtain money from the 

2

bank. 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right. 
Whether it's money that the 

5

bank itself owns or whether it's money of which the bank 

6

has custody.  That would seem to me the simplest theory. 

7

And I wonder, is that what courts have said? 

8
9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think what courts have said 

is that those kinds of schemes are directed at 

10

victimizing the third party, not a bank, and that leaves 

11

to the States their traditional authority to prosecute 

12

bad check cases, which I don't think should be 

13

troublesome. 

14
15

 If I could reserve the remainder of my 
time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

17

 Mr. Yang. 

18

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG 

19
20
21

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. YANG: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

22

 Congress drafted Section 1344 with two 

23

separate clauses, each of which serves a distinct 

24

function.  The first clause targets schemes to defraud a 

25

bank.  That requires intent that the scheme have the

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

purpose of defrauding a bank. 
 Clause (2)  and this is at page 5a of the 

3

government's brief, you can see the structural 

4

difference quite plainly.  Clause (2) targets schemes to 

5

obtain property that's either owned by or under the 

6

custody or control of a bank.  And Congress enacted 

7

these broad disjunctive clauses in response to this 

8

Court's decision in Maze as well as in Williams, which 

9

had curtailed the Government's ability to prosecute 

10
11

precisely these types of fraud. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Yang, your 

12

interpretation of the statute goes far beyond Maze. 

13

Maze was something with a fraudulent credit card or 

14

forged check or something like that, but if I understand 

15

your interpretation of the statute, you know, if I sell 

16

a painting to somebody and I represent it to be by a 

17

famous artist and in fact I've just made it in my 

18

kitchen, and that person pays me with a check and it's a 

19

perfectly valid check, it's a good check, the fraud is 

20

obviously as to the person who's just bought the 

21

painting.  It has nothing to do with the bank.  But your 

22

interpretation would cover that case as well. 

23

 MR. YANG: 

That is correct.  Our 

24

understanding of the text, and the reason why that is 

25

the case is because Congress specified in clause (2)

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the scheme to obtain money or property from the 

2

bank has to be by means of a false or fraudulent 

3

pretense, but it doesn't specify to whom that false or 

4

fraudulent pretense must be made. 

5

 Now, we understand that that sweeps in 

6

broader than what Maze 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And it's just a little bit 

8

peculiar, right?  I mean, if somebody pays me in cash, 

9

the government can't prosecute the person.  If somebody 

10

pulls out a check, the government can, but that doesn't 

11

seem to make a whole lot of sense in terms of what the 

12

statute is about. 

13

 MR. YANG: 

Well, we think that the text 

14

suggests that what Congress was doing was enacting a 

15

broad prophylactic, because what Congress was 

16

addressing, remember, were situations where this Court 

17

had construed narrowly statutes which addressed 

18

situations like this where banks were the inherent 

19

secondline victims, and so what Congress wanted to 

20

avoid is 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But here the bank is not 

22

the victim.  That's the whole point.  In these con 

23

artist cases, the bank is incidental and 

24
25

 MR. YANG: 

That's exactly right.  That's why 

Congress was not intending specifically to get those,

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but enacted a broader statute so we wouldn't have 

2

debates about this.  Look at the debate that we're 

3

having in this case.  I think everyone can agree that 

4

the banks are, just like the banks in Maze, they're 

5

secondline victims.  There's an order to the bank. 

6

It's a check.  A check is simply an order to the bank to 

7

pay a specified sum 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But in Justice Kagan's 

9

hypothetical, the bank didn't have to refund the money. 

10

And we could sit around here all day with examples, but 

11

suppose you have a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee 

12

and he inflates the cost.  This would be  to the 

13

owner.  This would be a violation of the statute.  This 

14

is a sweeping interpretation you're offering us. 

15

 MR. YANG: 

We think that that is the 

16

interpretation reflected in the text, for the following 

17

reason.  Although it doesn't fall within the core of 

18

what Congress was trying to protect, it avoids the 

19

problems, the kind of debate that we're having here 

20

about situations that do fall within the core, because 

21

remember, now we're talking about, Petitioner says, 

22

well, you know, it wasn't sufficiently targeted, He 

23

didn't really victimize or harm the bank.  Congress was 

24

trying to get away from that type of inquiry.  And they 

25

said, look, if the scheme has the intent of obtaining

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

property either owned by or in the custody or control of 

2

the bank, so that means it can either be controlled by 

3

the bank, its own property or custody, property it's 

4

holding, or it's in the custody or control of others, 

5

but it's owned by the bank, a very broad coverage.  And 

6

if you try to obtain that property by means of false or 

7

fraudulent pretenses, we avoid this kind of discussion 

8

about were you sufficiently targeting, do you really 

9

intend to 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You do indeed, but you 

11

extend Federal law enormously into the kind of stuff 

12

that we've usually left to the States. 

13

 MR. YANG: 

I'm not sure that that's actually 

14

true.  It's a very strange federalism argument the 

15

Petitioner is making.  The Petitioner is saying, my 

16

conduct is a Federal crime.  It's a Federal crime under 

17

this.  It could be a Federal crime under that.  It's 

18

just not a FEDERAL crime under the bank fraud statute. 

19

That is a very strange federalism argument because 

20

Congress has already put its hands all over the subject. 

21

And what Congress is trying to do here was to respond to 

22

cases like Maze by enacting a broad statute.  Congress 

23

couldn't 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If I have it right, I just 

want to be sure, in my Crook case, which you may or may

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not remember, you're reading the word "obtained" to mean 

2

whoever knowingly executes a scheme or artifice to 

3

obtain.  It doesn't mean for him to obtain.  It means 

4

for anybody to obtain.  That's how you read it. 

5

 MR. YANG:

11
12

That's correct because 
And that has been  and 

that has been pretty much the universal 
 MR. YANG: 

Understanding of obtain.  This 

Court 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay, okay, okay.  You 

don't have to argue it.  I just wanted to know now 
 MR. YANG: 

That's just the uniform 

13

understanding of the dictionary as well as this Court's 

14

cases. 

15
16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Fine, fine, fine, then is 

the way you see the statute. 

17

 MR. YANG: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's correct. 
That Mr. Crook goes to 

19

Mr. Smith and says, dear Mr. Smith, here is my check for 

20

$50,000, knowing he only has $3 in his account.  All 

21

right.  Now, case one is Mr. Smith, not too bright, 

22

gives him $500.  Now, he might, Mr. Crook, think that 

23

Smith will then go and present the check to the bank and 

24

maybe get some money.  In that case, he has violated 

25

this, in your view, because Mr. Smith obtained money

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

from the bank and that was part of Mr. Crook's idea as 

2

what was likely to happen whether he'd wanted it to or 

3

not. 

4

 MR. YANG: 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

6

 MR. YANG: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Partially correct. 
All right. 
I would 
There's also Justice 

8

Scalia's point which is an important matter to me, and 

9

that is that there also is the case when Mr. Crook 

10

doesn't know how the banking system works at all and he 

11

has no idea that the bank will, in fact, give any money 

12

or whether it will give any money.  Those are the two 

13

cases. 

14
15

 MR. YANG: 

I have at least two responses. 

The first is 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

All I want is explanation. 

18
19
20
21
22

 MR. YANG: 

It doesn't need a response. 

Well, two explanations about that 

one. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Give an explanation rather 

than a response. 
 MR. YANG: 

I will give an explanation that 

23

will be connected to the question.  The explanation is, 

24

I think, twofold.  First, as the Court explained in 

25

Neder, the gravamen of this statute, just like the

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

gravamen of the mail fraud or the wire fraud is not the 

2

particular acts or that the particular acts are done 

3

well or have any likelihood of success.  It is the 

4

scheme.  And so therefore questions about reliance 

5

the bank doesn't have to believe it or rely on it; 

6

damages that result don't have to rely.  This is a 

7

scheme.  It is criminalizing the scheme to obtain 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what do you do with 

the case, the second part of the hypothetical that 

10

Justice Breyer didn't repeat where the person knows the 

11

bank is not going to pay a cent because there's no money 

12

in this account. 

13

 MR. YANG: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think that 
And so there is no part 

15

of the scheme to obtain funds from the bank because they 

16

know that the bank won't pay it. 

17

 MR. YANG: 

Well, they may  they may 

18

suspect that the bank may not pay it.  Banks sometimes 

19

in fact do pay checks on insufficient funds.  Banks have 

20

only 24 hours after receipt of a check to dishonor it or 

21

not and if they don't then they are stuck in the UCC and 

22

have to bring lawsuits.  I mean the practical impact of 

23

this type of situation is significant.  About a billion 

24

dollars a year 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Answer  what's the answer

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to Justice Sotomayor's question? 

2

 MR. YANG: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, it depends on 
Mr.Crook is not too bright 

4

and Mr. Crook doesn't even know what a bank is and all 

5

he knows is he's can get $500 from this other notgenius 

6

Mr. Smith.  So he does not care about banks.  He doesn't 

7

know how they work.  He has no idea if they pay or don't 

8

pay.  What's the result? 

9

 MR. YANG: 

I think it would be very hard for 

10

the government to prove that your inept bank 

11

thief had a scheme to obtain money or property from the 

12

bank, but the government might be able to prove it 

13

circumstantially because, just as Justice Alito 

14

explained, you rarely have insight into the heart of 

15

hearts of criminals.  You need to have circumstantial 

16

evidence.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

In what case, what 

Federal statute criminalizes a con game? 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Criminalizes what?  I 

didn't 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

A con game.  What 

22

Federal statute  513 criminalizes altering checks, but 

23

what other Federal statute makes it a Federal crime to 

24

engage in a con game without a check? 

25

 MR. YANG: 

I'm not sure exactly what you

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mean by a con game the there are plenty of Federal 

2

statutes that address 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, somebody says I'm 

4

going to paint your house and takes a check for $100 and 

5

doesn't paint the house. 

6

 MR. YANG: 

Well, the answer is that Congress 

7

has addressed false statements, schemes to defraud, 

8

schemes to obtain money or property through all kinds of 

9

various statutes, mail fraud, wire fraud, false 

10

statements, bank fraud.  It just is done so in 

11

particular areas where there is a Federal interest 

12

implicated.  And it  actually, those areas are quite 

13

sweeping and bank fraud 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And that would be one of 

15

them, if you  if you accept a check, right?  If  if 

16

you promise to paint the house, you have no intention of 

17

doing it, so it's fraud, and  and you accept the 

18

check.  That's it.  You're under the statute, right? 

19

 MR. YANG: 

The government would have to 

20

prove that the scheme was intended to obtain money or 

21

property from the bank.  If that was shown, and it was 

22

shown that that was 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And what does that mean, 

24

Mr. Yang?  I mean, it could mean that the  that the 

25

defendant intends that the money come from the bank, or

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you could mean that the defendant intends to obtain 

2

money which he knows may or is reasonably likely to or 

3

is foreseeable to come from the bank.  Which do you 

4

mean? 

5

 MR. YANG: 

I think we kind of mean both. 

6

And let me explain why.  As Justice Alito, I think, kind 

7

of alluded to, as a practical matter, the way you prove 

8

these cases is you prove that a defendant generally 

9

intends the natural consequences of his or her acts. 

10

And so if, for instance, you have a case like this where 

11

you have a fraudulent check which is directed to a bank, 

12

it says, bank, pay the payee this sum of money, that the 

13

defendant is going to intend, when they tendered that to 

14

the  to the merchant, that that check is going to be 

15

sent to the bank and that the bank is going to  you 

16

know, has a reasonable chance of paying it. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I think this does go 

18

back to Justice Alito's question, because the person can 

19

say  the defendant here could have said, I really 

20

don't care whether the bank ends up paying Target.  I 

21

don't know whether the bank will end up paying Target. 

22

I don't know how these things work and how often the 

23

bank honors it and how often the bank doesn't honor it. 

24

And I really could not care less as long as I get my 

25

money from Target.

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. YANG: 

Right.  But in our legal system, 

2

I don't think it's  let me give you another example. 

3

Let's say you want to kill somebody and you put a car 

4

a bomb in their car.  All right?  And there are two 

5

people in the car.  You see the target go in and you see 

6

someone else go in, and you detonate the bomb.  You 

7

can't say I was really indifferent about the second 

8

person being there. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, but  so you're saying 

10

that my person  forget the other examples.  I mean, 

11

you're saying that this person who could not care less 

12

if the money comes from the bank and actually thinks 

13

that the money may not come from the bank because it's 

14

quite likely that the bank is not going to honor this, 

15

you think, nonetheless, that that person has intended to 

16

obtain bank property? 

17

 MR. YANG: 

Has  yes, by the virtue of the 

18

scheme.  The scheme used 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But wait.  I thought  I 

20

thought you said earlier, and  and I was going to ask 

21

you about that, that he does not have to personally 

22

receive bank property. 

23

 MR. YANG: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Right. 
He just intends that bank 

property be given to somebody.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. YANG: 

To be transferred per his 

direction. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 MR. YANG: 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes. 
Yes, that's exactly right. 
And  and you've been 

6

slipping back into the hypotheticals where the bank is 

7

going to bear the loss.  But your position also covers 

8

instances where the bank does not bear any loss, the 

9

fraudulent contractor that  Justice Kagan's 

10

hypothetical about the phony painting, the bank is not 

11

going to give that money back. 

12

 MR. YANG: 

And  and for good reason, for 

13

multiple reasons.  One, this is prohibiting the scheme, 

14

not a good scheme, not a completed scheme, not an 

15

effective scheme and 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you have federalized 

17

every fraudulent transaction in the economy whenever a 

18

check is involved. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. YANG: 

Absolutely. 
Not whenever a check is involved. 

21

The government would still have to show that the scheme 

22

itself was intended to obtain money or property from the 

23

bank and did so by 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I mean, I can think 

about it tonight, but I'd like an example of a check

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

where the money doesn't come from a bank. 
 MR. YANG: 

Well, in the check context, I 

3

think there is none.  I mean, what you have, if you're 

4

obtaining that check in order to get the money from 

5

or property from the bank, I think it would fall within. 

6

And again, we understand this is a broad reading.  We 

7

we own  own up with  for that. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I just make sure I  I 

understand your  your answer to my question.  Suppose 

10

that this defendant did not return the merchandise for 

11

cash.  In other words, suppose he just wanted an Xbox 

12

and he did the exact same thing.  So he never himself 

13

wanted cash and, again, could not have cared at all 

14

whether the bank was going to give the vendor cash. 

15

Still, you would say that person intended to obtain bank 

16

property? 

17

 MR. YANG: 

By virtue  yes, we would say 

18

that by virtue of the scheme  remember, he's not just 

19

walking in and saying, you know, I'll pay you tomorrow 

20

if you give me a hamburger today.  The  he's going in 

21

with a check.  A check is  everyone knows what a check 

22

is.  It is an order to a bank to pay money.  He's giving 

23

it to the  to the bank or to the merchant 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But he's  he's not 

obtaining the bank's money.  You  you read to

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

obtain  a scheme or artifice to obtain, you read that 

2

for anybody to obtain.  I would read it to mean for him 

3

to obtain.  But that's not how you read it.  And you say 

4

that's  everybody reads it the way you do? 

5

 MR. YANG: 

Well, this  this Court has long 

6

recognized that the word "obtain" not only means that 

7

you obtain it for yourself, but you can obtain something 

8

by directing the transfer of  of property to someone 

9

else.  And that's exactly what a check does.  You are 

10
11

directing the 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Yang, before you 

12

finish, Mr. Russell pointed out  and I think Justice 

13

Sotomayor  that there is Section 513.  It deals 

14

with  expressly with altered checks, but the penalty 

15

is much, much less.  Is everything that is covered by 

16

513 covered by 1344, too? 

17

 MR. YANG: 

Well, I think the answer is that 

18

has not been decided.  And let me just explain in  in 

19

a few ways.  One, Section 513 deals with securities, 

20

which includes checks of States or organizations, and 

21

then it defines organizations.  There is a substantial 

22

question whether that applies to personal checks.  One 

23

court of appeals has said it has.  The Department of 

24

Justice's Criminal Resource Manual says it does not 

25

apply to personal checks.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So there is a real question about whether 

2

this Section 513 would apply.  But even if it were to 

3

apply, it applies to protect the integrity of certain 

4

writings.  It is a different provision than a 

5

schemebased provision like Section 1344, which more 

6

broadly prohibits types of schemes to obtain money or 

7

property from banks.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And is it  is it true 

that there's a 2year mandatory minimum? 
 MR. YANG: 

Not for bank fraud.  There is 

aggravated identity theft for which 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Under this statute, is 

there  is there a mandatory minimum? 
 MR. YANG: 

No.  Well, this  this statute, 

15

the bank fraud statute has a punishment of up to 30 

16

years to reflect that frauds come in various sizes. 

17

It's not a mandatory minimum.  It's just a maximum.  And 

18

in this case, the defendant actually got 1 year for this 

19

bank fraud.  He got a  a stacked sentence of 2 years 

20

for identity theft, which is separate from this 

21

provision. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Yang, if we are 

23

concerned about federalizing every case involving a 

24

check, okay, you  your brief does give us an 

25

alternative.

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. YANG: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3

Yes. 

locate that alternative in the language of the statute. 

4

 MR. YANG: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

6
7

My problem is, I can't 

Well, I think 
So are you asking us 

just to make it up?  Or if not, how do we reach it? 
 MR. YANG: 

We're not asking you actually 

8

to  to make that interpretation.  It would be if the 

9

Court concludes that our first interpretation is somehow 

10

problematic, then we think that that is a superior 

11

reading than Petitioner's for the following reason: 

12

Congress addressed 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, no, no.  Please 

14

answer, how do we get to your reading from the text of 

15

the statute. 

16

 MR. YANG: 

I will.  The way you get there is 

17

that Congress, in Clause 2, again, remember, specifies 

18

you have intent to obtain money or property from a bank 

19

by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, 

20

representations, or promises.  It does leave silent to 

21

whom those false or fraudulent representations must be 

22

made. 

23

 Now, if you look at the legislative history, 

24

it's very clear that Congress was at least concerned 

25

with situations like Maze where a bank would be a victim

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of a fraud.  And those  and Maze involved a situation 

2

precisely like what we have here, where the reason that 

3

the bank is a secondary victim is because that false 

4

signature, the false charge slip 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So far I'm with you, but 

you haven't answered my question. 
 MR. YANG: 

But the way it is in that 

8

context, the reason that the bank is the victim of the 

9

scheme is because the fraudulent method is actually 

10

transferred to the bank as an inherent part of the 

11

scheme itself.  And so 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I  I agree that that 

13

interpretation substantially narrows the statute because 

14

the altered check, the bank is going to be certainly at 

15

risk of loss.  If  if we were to agree with that 

16

suggestion and were inclined to read the statute that 

17

way, is there a case that you can cite to us that says 

18

we have a duty to save poorly drawn statutes by a 

19

sensible amendment? 

20

 MR. YANG: 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No.  No, I don't think we 
I mean, what  what case 

22

do you  what case do you want me to cite if I adopt 

23

your alternate  your fallback position? 

24
25

 MR. YANG: 

I don't think we are relying on 

the idea that the  what the Court is  would be doing

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is construing the statute in light of, presumably, some 

2

good reason to reject what we think is what the statute 

3

normally says. 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why don't you try the rule 

of lenity. Why don't you try the rule of lenity? 
 MR. YANG: 

We think that the rule of lenity 

7

doesn't apply for the reasons that we said on our 

8

broader argument.  If the Court rejects that, that might 

9

be a reason but, again, it's construing the term 

10
11

"means." 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Does the rule of lenity 

12

provide a precedent for us to adopt the narrowing 

13

interpretation, your fallback position? 

14

 MR. YANG: 

I think just in any context where 

15

you might have constitutional doubt, the Court 

16

sometimes, you know, construes a statute in a way that 

17

it might not otherwise do. 

18

 And here what we're giving you the hook for 

19

this is that the means specified leaves open to whom 

20

that false or fraudulent communication must be directed. 

21

You could read, in light of the history and in light of 

22

what Congress's main intent was here, to read the 

23

statute as saying, ah, Congress actually in clause 2 was 

24

concerned with the specific type of means, that is the 

25

means that are directed to the bank.

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And the reason I think this is far superior 

2

than what Petitioner suggests is because we are at least 

3

construing silence in the statute.  Congress 

4

specifically addressed intent already in clause 1, that 

5

is intent to defraud a bank, which is what Petitioner 

6

says clause 2 does.  But clause 2 says there's intent to 

7

obtain money or property from the bank.  There's no 

8

reason to run over Congress's choice about what types of 

9

schemes have to be intended in order to achieve this 

10
11

result.  Again, this is our fallback position 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If  if we adopt your 

12

fallback position, does (2) do anything that (1) doesn't 

13

do?  I mean, if you made  if you made your false or 

14

fraudulent representations to the bank, surely you 

15

intend to defraud the bank. 

16

 MR. YANG: 

Both clauses, actually, under our 

17

fallback or our main position cover things that the 

18

others will not.  And I'll give you two examples.  On 

19

clause 1, clause 1 covers what's called bare check 

20

kiting, where you write a check, it hasn't sufficient 

21

funds, you withdraw the money, then you write another 

22

check to cover it and another check and you play the 

23

float.  Nine courts of appeals have addressed this 

24

question.  All of them have concluded that it falls 

25

under clause 1.  Six of them have concluded it doesn't

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fall under clause 2, and the additional three court of 

2

appeals that have criminal jurisdiction in either 

3

unpublished or in dictum have suggested agreement. 

4

 So it's pretty well established check kiting 

5
6

falls under (1), not (2). 
 With respect to (2), it covers schemes like 

7

this, where you can argue maybe you didn't intend to 

8

defraud the bank itself, but you used false or 

9

fraudulent means that would inherently go to the bank 

10

because of the nature of the means themselves.  Here 

11

where you direct a check, it's a financial instrument. 

12

It is ordering a bank to pay money.  It goes to the 

13

bank, and one normally intends the natural consequences 

14

of their acts.  It goes to the bank in the ordinary 

15

course. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Which part of the 

17

statute are you interpreting with this limiting 

18

principle, the "obtain" part? 

19

 MR. YANG: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 MR. YANG: 

"By means of." 
"By means of." 

By means of the false or 

22

fraudulent pretenses in this, understanding these false 

23

or fraudulent pretenses to be ones which are directed to 

24

the bank as an inherent consequence of the scheme 

25

itself.

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Yang, your first order 

2

argument, which is, you know, the natural way one would 

3

read a statute that says "(1) or (2)," is to interpret 

4

it as meaning two different things. 

5

 MR. YANG: 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
But that requires us to read 

7

it differently from the way we read the exact same 

8

words, without the numbers, but the exact same words in 

9

McNally.  And we know that Congress wanted the bank 

10

fraud statutes to mirror the mail and wire fraud 

11

statutes.  So we end up with this  you know, if we 

12

if we go with your friend over there, we read a statute 

13

in a way we wouldn't normally.  But if we go with you, 

14

we have to read these two statutes that say the same 

15

thing and that we know Congress meant to say the same 

16

thing differently. 

17

 MR. YANG: 

Right.  And I think that there 

18

are very sound reasons for doing that and I'll explain 

19

why.  First, when you look at the statute, Section 1344, 

20

this is on page 5A in the bank frauds  or the mail 

21

fraud statute is 1341 on 2A, they are quite different. 

22

I mean, even when we just look at the statutory 

23

structure alone, Congress broke these clauses up, put 

24

them on different lines, numbered them, indented them 

25

equally.  One would not naturally say you have the

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

option of one, Option A, or two, Option B 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I take your point that 

3

the words on the page look very good for you.  But we 

4

also know that Congress didn't intend for those 

5

differences in spacing and numerology to have a 

6

difference in meaning, don't we? 

7

 MR. YANG: 

No, no.  Congress modeled  it's 

8

certainly true that Congress modeled the bank fraud 

9

statute on the mail fraud statute.  But that doesn't 

10

mean that Congress wanted the two statutes to be 

11

coterminous.  In fact, Congress not only expressed its 

12

understanding that these were disjunctive for the 

13

various structural reasons, which I think are 

14

inescapable from the text.  But also Congress modified 

15

the text itself.  Congress didn't simply say a scheme to 

16

defraud.  It requires a scheme to defraud a financial 

17

institution.  Congress did not say a scheme to obtain 

18

money or property.  It specified that it's not only 

19

property of the bank, owned by the bank; it is property 

20

under the bank's custody that the bank doesn't own and 

21

bank  property that the bank owns, but is not even 

22

under its custody or control, it's under the custody or 

23

control of others. 

24
25

 This is a different statute, of course 
modeled on the mail fraud statute, but it's different.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And Congress I don't think in 1984 could have been more 

2

clear about its intent to make these two provisions, 

3

that is the intent to defraud and the intent to obtain 

4

provisions, distinct based on the choices that it made 

5

in text. 

6

 It's just, I think, impossible to read the 

7

text and come away with the conclusion that in 1984 what 

8

Congress intended, regardless of what happened in the 

9

mail fraud statute in 1987, that Congress intended that, 

10

or notwithstanding the only reading of "or" in this 

11

context that makes any textual sense, since it's not 

12

even defended in the textual argument on the other side, 

13

that Congress meant that "or" in that structure to mean 

14

anything but "or."  That is, a disjunctive, two separate 

15

clauses having independent meaning. 

16

 And in fact, it would be anomalous to do so 

17

because Section (2) covers, for instance, bankowned 

18

property that's not under the custody or the control of 

19

the bank.  So why would you intend to defraud the bank 

20

when you're trying to really get it from the custodian 

21

of the bank's property?  The idea would be that the 

22

means obtained, at the very least, would probably be 

23

directed to the custodian of the property, not  which 

24

is not always the bank under clause 2. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is the government still

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

taking the position that it took in the district court, 

2

that 1344(1) also covers this case? 

3

 MR. YANG: 

Well, we disagree with the court 

4

of appeals precedent which says you need a risk of loss 

5

under clause 1.  But the government acquiesced to the 

6

district court's narrowing of this to clause 2. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Along those lines, if we 

8

were to agree that under sub (2) it was necessary to 

9

show an intent to defraud the bank, what would the 

10

government have to prove in an altered check case? 

11

 MR. YANG: 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I guess you've 
Or what would you have had 

13

to prove under sub (1) if this case could properly be 

14

prosecuted under sub (1)? 

15

 MR. YANG: 

Well, you'd have to show that the 

16

scheme was actually intended to obtain, to deceive the 

17

bank, as well as obtain its property, as opposed to a 

18

and that intent difference can be significant in cases. 

19

What we will have to show in here 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, how can that intent 

21

difference be significant?  I mean, I would have thought 

22

that you would said the same proof that goes to whether 

23

you intend to obtain bank property, even though you're 

24

presenting this check only to a third party, and the 

25

check may or may not be honored by the bank.  You could

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say the exact same thing about whether you intend to 

2

defraud the bank. 

3

 MR. YANG: 

We certainly would probably rely 

4

on the same types of evidence.  We would then have the 

5

additional burden of having to show that the intent was 

6

to deceive the bank specifically. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What I'm getting at is would 

8

this require delving into the defendant's knowledge of 

9

the legal relationship between the merchant here and the 

10
11

bank? 
 MR. YANG: 

I think it inevitable is going to 

12

come to that, and you're going to throw to juries these 

13

questions of, like, you know, despite the fact that the 

14

defendant has used a check, did the defendant really 

15

know what a check was or did the defendant  what is a 

16

check 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But why isn't that the 

18

same under the intent to obtain bank property?  Where 

19

you also, the defendant, might say:  No, I really didn't 

20

intend to obtain property, because I didn't really know 

21

whether the bank would honor the check and, in fact, I 

22

thought it wouldn't. 

23

 MR. YANG: 

Well, the scheme would be to 

24

obtain.  You don't have to necessarily show that the 

25

specific means that you were using were intended to

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deceive the bank, because that requires a lot more 

2

inquiry 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But even on the obtain 

4

property wing, it's obtain property from the bank, isn't 

5

it? 

6
7
8
9
10

 MR. YANG: 

Not obtain property from the 

bank.  It is obtain property that is 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, in the custody of the 

bank? 
 MR. YANG: 

It doesn't have to be in the 

11

custody of the bank.  It can be bankowned property in 

12

the custody of others.  So, for instance, banks have a 

13

lot of assets.  For instance, they can foreclose on 

14

houses and such.  In those contexts, you might have 

15

someone who is scheming to obtain bank property by 

16

directing their fraud to a third party to whom the bank 

17

has entrusted their assets. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, but in a case like this, 

19

wouldn't the difficulties of proof be the same?  The 

20

person  whether you charge somebody with trying to 

21

defraud the bank or with trying to obtain property owned 

22

by or in the custody of the bank.  If Justice Alito is 

23

right as to the one, that all these questions about the 

24

relationship between a bank and a retailer are going to 

25

come in, isn't he also right as to the other?

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. YANG: 

I'm not quite  I don't think 

2

that's quite right.  And the reason is that whenever you 

3

have to show an additional intent requirement, it ups 

4

the ante.  Just like in homicide, you have various 

5

gradations of a homicide including up to murder.  When 

6

you have an additional 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Doesn't the answer depend on 

8

from whom  for whom the money, either owned or 

9

under  in the custody of the bank has to be obtained? 

10

If it  if it doesn't have to be obtained by the 

11

defendant, then it wouldn't seem to me that there would 

12

be much of a question.  Because even if the only thing 

13

that the defendant obtains from the merchant is an Xbox, 

14

if the  if the check is honored, it is going to be 

15

obtained by the merchant.  Somebody is going to be 

16

obtaining money from the bank if the check is ultimately 

17

honored. 

18

 MR. YANG: 

May I just  I would just 

19

qualify that by saying that the defendant is obtaining 

20

the money.  It's obtaining it through the check to be 

21

paid to the merchant.  That's 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right.  The ultimate 
Excuse me.  You have  you

 MR. YANG:

Exactly. 
The scheme has to contemplate 

that. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And if it's a scheme 

7

that  that's making alterations that no reasonable 

8

person would expect the bank to honor, it seems to me 

9

you're out of luck. 

10

 MR. YANG: 

11

Well, I don't  if I might 

respond, Mr. Chief Justice. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

 MR. YANG: 

Sure. 

The  I don't think that 

14

actually plays out in fact.  Banks suffer about a 

15

billion dollars in check fraud a year.  There are $10 

16

billion that banks put into check fraud prevention. 

17

There are so many checks that fly through, including the 

18

checks here.  If you look at the checks here, the ones 

19

that he got caught for, not the ones that he might have 

20

washed and dried, weren't artfully done.  But some still 

21

go through.  And the transaction costs that it imposes 

22

on the financial system is something that Congress could 

23

have been concerned with.  In fact, we think it was.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Thank you.  Congress was 

4

concerned about the  the risks to banks of altered 

5

checks, but it dealt with that in Section 513, not 

6

Section 1344. 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Yang said it 

wasn't  wasn't  the scope of 513 wasn't clear. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't think that that's 

10

correct.  I mean, we cited a case in our brief in which 

11

the government actually succeeded in prosecuting someone 

12

for an altered check under Section 513.  I don't 

13

understand the argument that checks aren't encompassed 

14

within 513.  We've reproduced the language at 10A of 

15

the blue brief.  And what it says is that it 

16

criminalizes the use of a forged security.  And it 

17

defines "forged" to mean altered.  It defines "security" 

18

to mean check.  And then it has to be a forged security 

19

of an organization.  And it defines "organization" to 

20

mean any legal entity other than a government 

21

established or organized for any purpose and includes 

22

any corporation, company, association, firm, et cetera. 

23

 I just don't understand what the argument is 

24

that Section 513 doesn't cover some species of altered 

25

checks.  But at the very least, if you thought that

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress must have intended to Federally criminalize use 

2

of all altered checks, it's an easier interpretation to 

3

say that 513 covers it than the bank fraud statute. 

4

 The government's argument here today makes 

5

utterly clear how broad the Federal bank fraud statute 

6

will be if you adopt their interpretation.  They're 

7

going  it encompasses the fake Renoir example and all 

8

of the ones in our briefs and it includes every 

9

notsufficientfunds case.  And  and the government 

10
11

acknowledges 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you please tell me 

12

why  what your objections are to the "by means of 

13

limiting principle" the government gives as an 

14

alternative? 

15

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So there's  there's several 

16

objections.  One is the one that you raised.  There's no 

17

basis for it in the text.  It is a limitation on what 

18

the  the statute says.  Any false representation, then 

19

they say no, only those false representations that would 

20

foreseeably go to a bank and might fool them into paying 

21

a check. 

22

 Second, it doesn't do any useful work 

23

because all it does is  the only difference between 

24

their fallback position and intent to defraud a bank is 

25

two things.  One is it permits them to bring cases in

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these thirdparty altered check cases, and we've argued 

2

we don't think that those fall under the statute anyway. 

3

 But even if you think that they do, the much 

4

easier thing to say is they fall under the statute. 

5

Intent to require  you know, defraud a bank is 

6

required, but the use of the altered check is sufficient 

7

evidence. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I think it does a 

lot of work because it  it takes out of the equation 

10

schemes to defraud where the bank is not going to be 

11

liable. 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Right.  I'm  I'm saying it 

13

doesn't do any work that intent to defraud a bank 

14

doesn't already do.  So if you're choosing between our 

15

test and their test, both tests allow prosecutions of 

16

paradigmatic fraud cases.  Both cases, both tests 

17

eliminate the Renoir example.  But their test permits 

18

the only difference, practical difference, is their case 

19

facilitates prosecution in these thirdparty cases that 

20

we don't think are covered by the statute anyway, but 

21

even if there are, you don't have to adopt this extra 

22

textual interpretation.  Instead 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But I don't understand 

24

how, if the falsehood is made to Target, who gives the 

25

person the DVD off the shelf, how you prove that that's

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an intent to defraud the bank as opposed to defraud 

2

Target. 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, so there's the 
So what's the charge you 

5

give to the jury to get to that?  I think the limiting 

6

principle is the charge that they want to get. 

7

 MR. RUSSELL: 

You say that they have to show 

8

that the defendant intended to deceive a bank, and the 

9

government can argue  and the government has 

10

successfully argued in many cases that use of an altered 

11

check shows that the defendant intended to deceive a 

12

bank. 

13

 And the government raises  you know, the 

14

government never likes to have to prove intent.  But the 

15

government raises these theoretical difficulties in 

16

proving intent, but it hasn't shown that this actually 

17

ever arises.  In fact, the government routinely convicts 

18

people in circumstances like this case, even in circuits 

19

where intent to defraud a bank is required.  It's just 

20

they didn't try to do that here because they didn't ask 

21

the jury to make that finding. 

22

 In addition, the difficulty of their test is 

23

it's just plain strange.  They say you should adopt 

24

their test because Congress didn't care about intent to 

25

defraud a bank.  Then they adopt a rule that looks very

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

much like the kind of rule you would adopt if you 

2

thought Congress cared about intent to defraud a bank. 

3

It's simply substituting some circumstantial evidence 

4

that one could argue to a jury shows intent to defraud a 

5

bank and saying that's all the government has to prove. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Your textual hook is that 

7

there  that the representation has to be made to the 

8

bank, right?  That's the only way you can get this 

9

within the statute. 

10

 MR. RUSSELL: 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

12
13

That's correct. 
But that's different from an 

intent to defraud the bank, isn't it? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think  well, that's the 

14

first half.  So there's two pieces:  Intent to deceive 

15

the bank, intent to obtain bank property. 

16

 We say that you can read the statute to 

17

require intent to deceive the bank because there's a 

18

statutory silence.  And then the government has to prove 

19

intent to obtain bank property.  That's easily proven 

20

when the check is directly presented to a bank.  We 

21

don't think it can be proven in a case like this because 

22

our client intended to obtain Target's property, not the 

23

bank's. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But where is the textual 

silence about  where do you get intent to deceive the

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bank into this? 

2

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think that's what  I get 

3

it from this Court's decision, for example, in McNally 

4

where it said 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Where do you get it the from 

6

the text?  I understand the argument.  It's a  it's a 

7

very credible argument.  It doesn't say to whom the 

8

representations have to be made.  So you put in to the 

9

bank. 

10

 MR. RUSSELL: 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

12

Right. 
I don't see how you get from 

there to defrauding the bank. 

13

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So if you read it to mean that 

14

you have to direct the false statement to the bank, that 

15

is the first half of what McNally said intent to deceive 

16

a bank  or intent to defraud a bank is, you have to 

17

intend to deceive a bank.  And the second half is you 

18

have to get  intend the deceit to obtain bank 

19

property, which is on the face of Subsection (2).
