MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Section 704(a), Title VII, prohibits the use

12

of third-party reprisals as a method of retaliating

13

against a person who complained to the EEOC or otherwise

14

opposed discrimination.

16

forbidden.

The elements of the statute are unrelated to

19

show that discrimination occurred with regard to the

individual who engaged in a protected activity.

21

it's a very valuable employee.

22

because the company is worth less, having lost this

24

employee, under Title VII?

Can the shareholders sue

That is the other question.

far.

17

Government has -- I -- I think as far as you need to go,

18

which is not the same as saying that's as far as the law

19

goes, is the standard articulated by the Government, as

20

in McCready, where the action against Thompson was the

21

very method by which the law was violated, that that

22

would satisfy the requirement of person aggrieved.

23

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Where does that come from?

Where does that test come from?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Your Honor, I don't -- I

7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

think that's as far as you need to go in this case.

2

think the standard of aggrieved is broader than that,

3

but the -- in -- as this has played out in the lower

4

courts since Trafficante, there's a wide range of

5

different kinds of circumstances under which the

6

Trafficante rule has been invoked in Title VII cases.

7

We're not asking you to address all of those.
JUSTICE ALITO:

8
9

I

I understand the argument.

I don't really -- it's not too helpful, at least to me,

10

to say as far as we need to go in order to reverse.

11

That's really not how a statute ought to be interpreted,

12

I would say.

13

understand the argument that "aggrieved" means all the

14

way to what's -- all that's necessary is what is

15

necessary to satisfy the Constitution.

What -- now, I

And I understand

It's a very broad argument with a lot of

But if -- if that's not correct, then what

18
19

What does it mean?

is the correct test and where does it come from?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

20

Well, Your Honor, I think

21

that there are two other limitations that would be

22

applicable here, as indeed they would have been under

23

Title VIII.

24
25

First one is proximate cause, which will cut
off a lot of injuries down the road.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

And Title VII is

Official

1

adopted against a background of proximate cause rules,

2

and there, I don't think -- we don't contend that in

3

using the word "person aggrieved" they meant -- Congress

4

meant to set those aside.
Secondly, the -- I think a fair reading of

5
6

the word "aggrieved" is that it is -- "aggrieved" is

7

both, in ordinary English, frankly, broader and narrower

8

than "injured."

9

not your concern -- in the sense that it covers people

It is broader -- and that's, of course,

10

who haven't been injured yet but might be injured in the

11

future.
But it also has a second element which is

12
13

that the action at issue involves some sort of a wrong.

14

If someone deliberately knocks me down, I'm injured, I'm

15

probably aggrieved, but not if I'm carrying a football

16

in the middle of a football game.

17

thing to do.

18

That's a legitimate

So I think that there has to be a wrong, and

19

the wrong has to be the -- the basis of the -- of the

20

plaintiff's objection.

21

the plaintiff really didn't care one way or another why

22

-- why that harm had happened.

23

case, that's precisely why Thompson complains.

24

suggesting that he would be wronged if he were ever

25

fired at all.

You could have a situation where

4

with the argument that says there's a middle step?

5

6

7

If I might go back to how that came up in

18

aggrieved.

And then, in footnote 1, the

Notwithstanding that, they then went on to

23

of action.

plaintiff would have to prove that that was indeed the

15

company's motive for picking him to fire him.
Secondly, under this Court's decision in

16
17

Burlington Northern, the plaintiff would have to show

18

that this was a retaliatory action sufficiently serious

19

that it was -- it would likely persuade a reasonable

20

employee in Regalado's position -- dissuade her

complaint.

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

How does that translate?

3

How does that Burlington Northern standard translate

4

into the situation in which there is some sort of

5

relationship between the -- the person who engaged in

6

the protected conduct and the person who suffers the

7

adverse employment action?
That's what's troubling to me about -- about

8
9

the theory.

Where it's a fiancé, it's -- that's a

10

relatively strong case, but I can imagine a whole

11

spectrum of cases in which there is a lesser

12

relationship between those two persons, and if -- if -­

13

unless there's a clear line there someplace, this theory

14

is rather troubling.

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, I think -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can you help -- can you help

provide where the clear line is?

Does it go to -- does

18

it include simply a good friend?

Does it include

with the person who engaged in the protected conduct?

protected conduct?

And she says:

Do you restore

him?

You do everything you would normally have to do,

20

because otherwise she is suffering the kind of injury,

though it was to him, that amounts to discrimination for

22

opposing a practice.

What's wrong with that theory?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

remedy would pose very serious problems under Article

10

discrimination, they would be automatically protected

11

Well, if there's -- I don't

aren't.

particular person.

You -- your -- your concern is confined to a

In this hypothetical, it's an unlimited

10

universe that you don't have any reason to know where it

12

ends.

13

MS. KRUGER:

Well, it's certainly going to

14

be important, whenever a plaintiff brings a suit like

15

this, both to establish that the employer knew of the

16

relationship and the relationship was one that is of

17

sufficient closeness that a reasonable employee might be

18

deterred from making or supporting a charge of

19

discrimination -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why does that matter

21

under your theory?

Let's assume the different -­

22

slightly different, that they're just coworkers, but a

23

coworker who has expressed sympathy for the

24

discriminated person, has spoken about them in a

25

favorable light or has tried to defend them.

Would that

MS. KRUGER:

Well -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- if the intent was to

4

retaliate against the person complaining of

5

discrimination by getting rid of their friend who's

6

supporting them?

7

MS. KRUGER:

In that scenario, I think that

8

that person would have a cause of action but for a

9

different reason.

10

Under this Court's decision in Crawford,

11

that person would probably be considered to be a person

12

who had opposed the discrimination and, for that reason,

13

would themselves have engaged in a protected activity.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So an opposer is anyone

MS. KRUGER:

That's our understanding of

what this Court held in -- in the Crawford case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But let's assume they

19

did it just in private, but the employer knew it.

They

20

overheard a conversation between the close friend and

21

the employee saying:

22

know you've been treated unfairly.

I think that -- again, I think

that's a question that sort of turns on whether a jury

2

would find the reasonable employee in the position of

the person who had engaged in protected activity would

5

discrimination if they knew the consequence was that

before a jury as an employer all the time.

I want -- I

I don't even want to mess with

10

people that might -- that might be buying a lawsuit.

11

And you're telling me, well, you know, I can't help you.

12

You have to go before a jury and say if this person is

13

close enough.
Why can't we say members of family and

14
15

fiancés?

MS. KRUGER:

16
17

Would -- would that be a nice rule?
Well, I think that it would be

an essentially arbitrary rule.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MS. KRUGER:

I know.

At end of the day, when the

20

question is just the question that the Court assigned

21

under Burlington Northern, it's a question that turns on

22

the specific facts and context of the -- a specific

23

case.

13

harm on an employee for retaliatory reasons.

What would you say is the degree of

MS. KRUGER:

I don't think that there's any

way to fashion a hard-and-fast rule.

19

matter is that most of the cases that have arisen that

20

have raised third-party retaliation arguments and which

21

are indeed cognizable under a number of -- of employment

22

statutes -- and I don't think Respondent disputes that

23

they are rightly so -- have largely concerned

24

relationships like the relationship between parent and

25

child, between husband and wife.

The fact of the

In one case under the Occupational Safety

between very good friends in the workplace, whereas

there is a D.C. Court of Appeals decision that holds

that a merely professional relationship that doesn't

exhibit that degree of personal affection isn't

7

sufficiently close.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MS. KRUGER:

Very good friends is enough?

I think that a reasonable

10

employee who knows that the consequence of making or

11

supporting a charge of discrimination is going to be

12

that their best friend at work is going to be fired may

13

be deterred from engaging in protected activity.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14
15

And in -- in your view,

could Regalado have brought this suit or brought a suit?
MS. KRUGER:

16

Yes, Justice Kennedy, we do

17

think that Regalado could have brought a suit in her own

18

right, because she, too, is a person aggrieved within

19

the meaning of the statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20
21

Well, if that is so, why

doesn't that vindicate the purposes of the Act?
MS. KRUGER:

22

Well, for two reasons, Justice

23

Kennedy.

First of all, Regalado here didn't sue, just

24

like most people in her position didn't sue, because

5

that part of the thrust of your argument is that this

6

was designed to hurt this -- Regalado, that she was

hurt, that this was injurious; then you say, oh, well,

8

it's not important enough for her to sue, so somebody

the other person might not sue.

Well, the fact that they were

close at the time of the retaliatory act doesn't

necessarily mean that they might still be close at the

time that they need to decide whether or not to press

charges.

5

But that's different from

6

the -- the point that you were first making, I thought,

7

was these are lay people; they don't have a lawyer; they

would naturally think that the person who was hurt would

be the one to sue.

retaliated against, would sue.

point.

Regalado in the driver's seat entirely with respect to

Burlington says she has to prove injury, that

So she -­

point, not that -- not that it's going to be very

difficult for employers to figure out who can be

protected and who can't?

You abandon that -- that

MS. LATHEROW:

7

No.

I think if Regalado has

8

the right to bring a cause of action, it is going to be

9

very difficult.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MS. LATHEROW:

Okay.
But I think that the way that

12

Burlington reads now, and that is whether someone would

13

be dissuaded, if that is harm to her, then she could

14

bring the cause of action.

15

applying the Burlington standard is you could have

16

someone who is dissuaded from filing a claim but may not

17

be harmed.

18

What's difficult about

For example, if an employer announced a

19

proposition that it was going to fire an employee at

20

random whenever someone filed an EEOC charge, I might

21

not file a charge because I wouldn't want someone, even

22

someone who I didn't know, to be terminated, but I

wouldn't be injured in that scenario.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- so she would have no

4

claim.

And if you think about it, if she was not

5

discriminated against, then the other people could not

6

bring a claim for discrimination based upon her.
What makes this case a little cloudy is that

7
8

Eric Thompson is an employee as well, but he doesn't

9

bring this case as an employee.

You could very well

10

have Eric Thompson as a spouse who is not employed.

So,

him a spouse, an even closer relationship than a fiancé,

and suppose that he -- his job -- he ran an animal

organization, but his only source of revenue was a

16

generous gift from North American Stainless at

Christmastime.
And in 2003, after Regalado filed her claim

Stainless said:
