CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument


now in Number 01-309, Larry Hope v. Mark Pelzer.

Mr.

Jones.


6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG T. JONES


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8
9

MR. JONES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


10

Under United States v. Lanier, the law was


11

clearly established for purposes of qualified immunity


12

when it gives officials fair warning that their conduct is


13

unlawful.

14

laid out by prior law applies with obvious clarity to the


15

conduct in question, even if the rule arises from a case


16

involving different facts.


17

The fair warning standard is met when a rule


The materially similar facts requirement of the


18

Eleventh Circuit is an unwarranted gloss upon the fair


19

warning standard, just like the fundamentally similar


20

facts requirement which this Court unanimously rejected in


21

Lanier.

22

emphasizes similarity of fact over clarity of ruling.


23

It is an impermissible gloss because it


QUESTION:

And what should be the rule that you


24

say was violated here?

If we write out the opinion, we'd


25

say the rule that the officer should have known is, and we

1

have to fill in the blank.

2

MR. JONES:

What is that rule?


The rule established by the Eleventh


3

Circuit's own precedent is that it is unconstitutional to


4

punish an inmate through the use of restraint, and


5

restraint is punitive if it goes beyond the point in time


6

which is necessary to quell a disturbance or immediate


7

threat.


8
9
10

QUESTION:

Does the include solitary


confinement?

MR. JONES:

No, Your Honor.

Restraint involves


11

total physical immobility coupled with the pain and


12

discomfort attendant to that.


13

QUESTION:

14

proposition?


15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19
20
21
22

And what case establishes that


Well, there is a --

Any physical restraint is unlawful. 


What case establishes that?

MR. JONES:

Physical restraint, the precedents


speak of physical restraint to a fixed object.

QUESTION:

Yes, and what precedent in


particular?

MR. JONES:

Gates v. Collier is the first case


23

of a body of law which has developed in our circuit,


24

Justice Scalia.

25

decision which was binding upon the present Eleventh


Gates v. Collier was a 1974 Fifth Circuit


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Circuit and it held that a variety of forms of corporal


2

punishment --


3

QUESTION:

That's my problem.

It was a whole


4

variety.

5

I recall that case, there are a number of instances of


6

brutality against prisoners, and the holding of that case


7

was that that was cruel and unusual punishment, but I


8

don't recall that case saying that any single one of the


9

many instances that the case recited, one of which was


10
11

They didn't say that any single one.

I mean, as


physical restraint, would qualify.

MR. JONES:

Your Honor, the Fifth Circuit


12

decision in Gates affirmed a district court decision which


13

specifically enjoined each and every one of those


14

punishments, and the fact that --


15

QUESTION:

And you think that amounts to a


16

holding that any single one of them would have violated


17

the Eighth Amendment?


18
19
20

MR. JONES:

Yes, Your Honor, if used punitively,


that is correct, and --

QUESTION:

But the court ordered stopping each


21

and every one of those measures.

22

of the injunctive degree, not just a combination of them,


23

but each one?


24
25

MR. JONES:

Wasn't that the nature


Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

This was not


a case where the court viewed the totality of the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

circumstances and said that the conditions constituted


2

cruel and usual punishment and ordered the State of


3

Mississippi to build a new prison.

4

the State was specifically enjoined --


5

QUESTION:

6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

This was a case where


Did the reasoning follow that line?

Well --

Was the reasoning of the opinion, did


8

it examine each one individually and say each one


9

individually was cruel and unusual?


10

MR. JONES:

It examined a variety of practices,


11

and those practices were discussed in a subsection called


12

corporal punishment.

13

multiple holdings does not make it any less important in


14

clearly establishing the law, otherwise a case could only


15

clearly establish the law if it had a single holding.

16

fact that Gates v. Collier drew multiple bright lines as


17

opposed to a single bright line did not make --


18

QUESTION:

19

MR. JONES:

20

QUESTION:

The fact that Gates involved


The


Do we need --

Yes.

In this case, do we need to get into


21

the issue, Mr. Jones of what this Court's holdings amount


22

to on this subject, or are we just limiting ourselves to


23

the Eleventh Circuit, perhaps the old Fifth Circuit?


24
25

MR. JONES:

With respect to the underlying


constitutional violation, or with respect to qualified

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

immunity analysis?


2

QUESTION:

3

MR. JONES:

With respect to each.

Well, Your Honor, this Court has


4

never squarely addressed the constitutionality of


5

continued restraint as a form of corporal punishment.

6

has acknowledged in decisions that restraints can be


7

harmful.


8
9

QUESTION:

It


I suppose one would have to do that,


yes.


10

MR. JONES:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

Are you relying on anything beyond


12

the restraint itself?

13

recited, the facts include leaving the individual in the


14

sun without a shirt on, and not giving him bathroom


15

breaks, and pouring water out in front of him to taunt


16

him.

17

I mean, in the facts that have been


Are you relying upon those features?

MR. JONES:

Not as -- not for the proposition


18

that the law was clearly established, with regard to those


19

facts.

20

the damages suffered by the 
 --

21

Those facts are certainly relevant on the issue of


QUESTION:

Well, do we have to assume that the


22

facts as alleged are true for purposes of deciding whether


23

summary judgment is appropriate?


24
25

MR. JONES:

Based -- Justice O'Connor, based


upon the grant of certiorari by the Court, the issues

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

raised in the petition, and the grant, I think that is


2

correct.


3

QUESTION:

I would assume we -- I gather we just


4

assume those are correct for purposes of evaluating the


5

summary judgment question.


6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

8

And the Eleventh Circuit decided


there was a constitutional violation?


9

MR. JONES:

10
11

I think that is correct.


QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And there was no cross-appeal on


that.


12

MR. JONES:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JONES:

That is correct, Your Honor.

So do we take that as a given, too?

I think that this case is like


15

Saucier, where the Court acknowledged that the first step


16

be the inquiry of whether there was a constitutional


17

violation made out by the facts.

18

circuit court.


19

QUESTION:

That was resolved by the


Well, that gets back to the Chief


20

Justice's question, and I'm wondering again if the Court


21

writes the opinion giving you the judgment that you seek,


22

isn't it necessary for us to say, a) this law was clearly


23

established, and b) it is a correct interpretation, a


24

correct exposition of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment


25

Clause, so we are -- it would be a rather odd holding for

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

us to say, well, this was established in the Eleventh


2

Circuit, but we're not telling you whether or not that was


3

right.


4

MR. JONES:

Well, I think, Justice Kennedy,


5

because the certiorari was only granted on the second part


6

of the Saucier test, that is, on the clearly established


7

inquiry, the Court could limit its ruling to the issue of


8

whether the law was clearly established and whether,


9

specifically whether the Eleventh Circuit applied the


10
11

proper standards in determining whether --

QUESTION:

Well, maybe Justice Kennedy is


12

suggesting that it's fairly included within the question


13

granted, that it's quite impossible for a judge to say


14

that it does or does not violate a clearly established


15

constitutional principle if he doesn't think that it


16

violates a constitutional principle at all, clearly


17

established or otherwise.

18

one sort of wrapped up in the other?


19

MR. JONES:

20

is fairly included.

21

QUESTION:

I mean, isn't -- doesn't -- the


Yes, Your Honor, and I think that it

My point is that --

I take it your position, though, is


22

that all we have to decide is whether the substantially


23

similar standard is the proper standard, and if we say no,


24

it's not, that's like Lanier, which was -- what was it? --


25

substantially identical, I guess, wasn't it, something

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2
3

like that?

MR. JONES:

The verdict was fundamentally


similar --


4

QUESTION:

5

MR. JONES:

6

QUESTION:

Fundamentally, yes. 

--in Lanier.

And if we say that that gloss, the


7

substantially similar gloss was wrong, what you want us to


8

do is simply vacate and send the thing back, or do you


9

want us to go further and say, no, in fact, there -- we


10

determined that there can be no sovereign -- that there


11

can be no qualified immunity here, because if we have to


12

go the second step, then we have to get into the issue, it


13

seems to me, that Justice Kennedy has raised.


14

MR. JONES:

Your Honor, I believe that the


15

first -- the issue of whether there's a constitutional


16

violation is fairly included within the questions which


17

were granted by the Court.


18

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, if that's what we're


19

going to get into, so we will determine what the violation


20

was and then get to immunity with respect to that


21

particular violation, we won't confine ourselves simply to


22

the substantially similar verbiage, then I go back to my


23

earlier question, and I take it -- and I think you've


24

answered it, but I want to make sure I understand you --


25

for purposes of determining whether there's a

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

constitutional violation, you are not arguing, I take it,


2

that we should take into consideration the particular


3

circumstances of the day, the heat, the shirt, the


4

bathroom breaks, the water, is that correct?

5

at is the restraint itself?


6

MR. JONES:

All we look


Yes, Your Honor, because the conduct


7

of these defendants was to restrain this man as a form of


8

punishment.


9

QUESTION:

And some of the allegations of the


10

facts have been questioned, and one point was about the


11

lack of bathroom breaks.

12

pleadings -- the pleadings didn't allege lack of bathroom


13

breaks, and how does that get into the cases if the other


14

circuits didn't mention that either?


15

MR. JONES:

There's nothing in the


Well, I think it got into the case


16

because the respondents wanted to argue the case rather


17

than the law.


18

QUESTION:

But that had not been found below,


19

and it hadn't been even asserted in the complaint, is that


20

correct?


21

MR. JONES:

Yes, that is correct, except to the


22

extent that the affidavit of the plaintiff was referenced,


23

I think incorporated by reference into the pleadings.


24
25

QUESTION:

And the plaintiffs affidavit said


that specifically, that he wasn't allowed bathroom breaks?

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. JONES:

The plaintiff's affidavit is that he


2

was left on the hitching post for 7 hours, and the fair


3

inference that can be drawn from that is that he was


4

restrained for 7 hours without breaks, and there's


5

certainly no evidence rebutting that with respect to the


6

second incident, which he was on the hitching post.


7

The first incident he was on the hitching post,


8

there is evidence that he was given one bathroom break,


9

and he was taken down that incident only after 2 hours,


10
11

which in itself is --

QUESTION:

That, we got into that.

That is, I


12

think, disputed even as to the first instance because I


13

think that the State said he had been offered other breaks


14

but he had declined them.

15

another argument that was made about the background, if


16

we're going to get anything beyond the hitching, that the


17

particular officers' names were not involved in some of


18

the worst aspects of that.


19

Well, that's one thing, and


That is, the officers that are named defendants


20

here didn't tell Hope to take off his shirt, and didn't


21

pour water in front of him and have the dogs drink it. 


22

Those were other people who are not named defendants, and


23

you don't contest that, do you?


24
25

MR. JONES:

I do not contest that reading of the


record, Justice Ginsburg.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

They didn't keep him on there for


2

7 hours, as far as we know.

3

charge of how long he would stay there?


4

MR. JONES:

Do we know that they were in


We do not know that, Your Honor,


5

although we do know that it was their expectation that he


6

be restrained indefinitely.

7

indicate that -- including the published case of Austin v.


8

Hopper, indicate that inmates were routinely left on the


9

hitching post for the remainder of the day.


10

QUESTION:

Findings in other cases


You say indefinitely.

According to


11

the prison policy, they were kept on until they agreed to


12

go back to the work crew without disrupting it, so that he


13

could have been released at any time that he said I'm


14

ready to go back on the work crew and do the work, right?


15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

17

Justice --

That's what the prison policy says,


anyway.


18

MR. JONES:

19

QUESTION:

Well --

Now, is the contention in this case


20

that he was prepared to -- you see, I don't understand


21

what they could have done.

22

policy of having work crews.

23

that's cruel and unusual punishment, right?


24

MR. JONES:

25

QUESTION:

Here is a prison that has a

You don't contend that


That is correct.

And the allegation is that this

13

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prisoner refused to work in one case, and disrupted a work


2

crew in another case, and according to the prison


3

policy -- I mean, you have to do something when he does


4

that.

5

to go back to prison, he says yes, that's exactly what I


6

want.

7

To take him back and say, oh, you know, you've got


What was the prison supposed to do?

MR. JONES:

Well, Justice Scalia, in both


8

instances he was being punished for fighting.

9

being punished for --


10

QUESTION:

11

MR. JONES:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. JONES:

He was


Disrupting the work crew.

For an altercation.

Okay.

An altercation which subsided at the


14

work site, which was miles away from the prison property,


15

and after he -- in each instant after he was restrained


16

and subdued, and whatever disruption he was a part of had


17

abated, he was put into a van for 20 minutes without


18

incident, another 20 minutes were spent transporting him


19

to the facility without incident, he was then walked


20

without incident, without the necessity for the use of


21

force, to the post.


22

QUESTION:

And the work rules were not brought


23

up by the State.

The Eleventh Circuit said specifically,


24

we are not going to consider these work rules because they


25

were never put in the district court record as a reason

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for the officer's behavior in question.


2

MR. JONES:

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg,


3

and if they were in the record, the evidence would also be


4

they were not followed, which was also consistent with the


5

finding of the Middle District of Alabama in the case of


6

Austin v. Hopper.


7

QUESTION:

8

as the fact?

9

of Larry Hope?


Do we take the fact in the second affidavit


10

MR. JONES:

11

QUESTION:

12

Quickly, what are we supposed to take


Yes.

Okay.

There's nothing about bathroom


breaks in that.


13

MR. JONES:

That is correct, but the critical


14

time element here is the time it took them between the


15

time that the disruption had abated and the time that they


16

decided to punish him for past conduct which had occurred


17

an hour earlier and 10 miles away.

18

time element, not the amount of time --


19

QUESTION:

You say it's critical.

20

critical?

21

instantaneously or never?


22

That is the critical


Why is that


I mean, must they decide to punish him


MR. JONES:

It's critical, Your Honor, because

24

circumstances.

You say no kind of restraint is


permissible?


3

MR. JONES:

Not as a form of punishment.

If

they need to restrain him to maintain order and discipline

at the scene of exigent circumstances, that's perfectly


6

proper.

QUESTION:

Or to make him go back to work.

You


8

say that that issue is not in this case.

You say that


9

there's not in this case the fact, contended by the State,


10

that the only reason he was restrained was to get him to


11

agree to go back to the work crew, and that as soon as he

he would have been released.

to escape punishment simply by --

So we should leave open -- even if we


19

decide in your favor, you want us to leave open the

question of whether this prison could follow the policy

that it has in effect, namely, only restraining people

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK


7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


8

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


9
10

MR. SCHLICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


11

An official is immune from personal liability


12

for violating Federal rights unless the violation would


13

have been clear to a reasonable officer.

14

the governing legal standard does not itself establish a


15

violation, the practical inquiry would be whether the


16

violation was established by case law is not


17

distinguishable in a fair way.


18
19
20

QUESTION:

Where, as here,


What, in your view, is the governing


legal standard that you just referred to?

MR. SCHLICK:

The overarching standard would be


21

the Harlow v. Fitzgerald, where the law was clearly


22

established.

23
24
25

The --


QUESTION:

Well, I thought -- you're not


talking, then, about a substantive standard?

MR. SCHLICK:

In that, in the particular context

17

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

where one looks to case law, this Court's decision in


2

Saucier v. Katz uses the formulation whether the facts


3

were distinguishable in a fair way, and that would be an


4

appropriate gloss as well.

5

QUESTION:

Now --


I mean, we start with a prohibition


6

for substantive law, the prohibition against cruel and


7

unusual punishment.

8

from there, or up from there, whatever you want to call


9

it?


10

Then how do we work ourselves down


MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

We would urge


11

the Court in this case to take the case on the terms on


12

which it was briefed and decided in the Eleventh Circuit,


13

that is whether the law they applied in the Eleventh


14

Circuit in 1995 clearly established the violation.

15

that context --


16

QUESTION:

In


Then we don't get into the question


17

of our own view whether -- what the law might, or the


18

result might be in this case?


19

MR. SCHLICK:

Even under that approach, the


20

first step would be to ask whether this Court's decisions


21

themselves gave clear notice, and the answer to that in


22

our view would be no.

23

Collier decision that these officers had fair warning, had


24

clear notice.


25

QUESTION:

It's only because of the Gates v.


So then the result could be one thing

18

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in the Eleventh Circuit and another thing in the Fourth


2

Circuit?


3

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, the -- it could be.

This


4

Court hasn't definitively decided whether, when it takes a


5

qualified immunity case, it should analyze the case in


6

light of its own law solely, or whether it should give


7

greater weight to the relevant circuits.

8

think it would give most guidance to the lower courts to


9

analyze the case as the Eleventh Circuit did.


10

QUESTION:

In this case, we


But what is the standard that the


11

officers should have been aware of, first in the Eleventh


12

Circuit, and then, assuming that we think we -- that this


13

case presents either the necessity or the proper


14

opportunity for us to say what the national standard ought


15

to be, what is the standard at a more specific level of


16

abstraction than Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause that


17

we should be dealing with?


18

MR. SCHLICK:

Justice Kennedy, let me address


19

the Eleventh Circuit first.

In the Eleventh Circuit, the


20

reasonable officer would have looked to the Gates v.


21

Collier decision, noted that it held that it violates the


22

Eighth Amendment to punish an inmate by handcuffing the

time.

2

The reasonable officer --

QUESTION:

Even if -- do you maintain that the


3

issue of whether it was done only to get him to return to


4

the work crew is not in the case?


5

MR. SCHLICK:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.


We have to assume that he was just


7

put on there to punish him, and he couldn't have been


8

released if he had said I'm ready to go back to the work


9

crew?


10

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

The Eleventh


11

Circuit we think correctly explained that's not a fair


12

inference from the record as we must take it.


13

In the Eleventh Circuit, the reasonable officer


14

would -- could not have concluded that there is a


15

constitutional difference between handcuffing an inmate to


16

a fence or a cell bar and handcuffing an inmate to a metal


17

pole.

Accordingly --


18

QUESTION:

For purposes of punishment?

MR. SCHLICK:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SCHLICK:

22

QUESTION:

For purposes of punishment.


You have to add that.

Yes, Your Honor.


And you're content to have us hold


23

these officers liable when a few years down the line we


24

may find that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong?


25

MR. SCHLICK:

Your Honor, we don't suggest a

20

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

view one way or the other on liability.

2

suggesting that to grant qualified immunity at this stage


3

of the case was improper.

4

second question --


5

QUESTION:

We're simply


That brings me, though, to the


Well, I understand, but I mean, they


6

would be stripped of their qualified immunity even though


7

the Eleventh Circuit's opinion was wrong, and we find it


8

to have been wrong when we finally confront that issue.


9

MR. SCHLICK:

I think that suggests Justice


10

Kennedy's second question, which was, absent Gates, how


11

would the case be viewed, and in that situation --


12
13

QUESTION:

And don't you think we have to reach


that?


14

MR. SCHLICK:

No.

No, we don't think so, Your


15

Honor, because it wasn't included in the petition or in


16

the questions on which this Court granted certiorari, and


17

really it hasn't been squarely faced by the parties,


18

because the State is defending the Regulation 429 rather


19

than the facts that must be taken as true in this case.


20

QUESTION:

Well, it's not defending Regulation


21

429, according to you.

22

he is released as soon as he agrees to go back to the work


23

crew without disruption.


24
25

MR. SCHLICK:

Regulation 429 as it reads says,


That's right.

My point, Justice


Scalia --

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

So regulation 429 is not in the case,


according to you.


3

MR. SCHLICK:

-- is that the respondents have


4

briefed the case as if they were acting in compliance with


5

Regulation 429, which is not in our view how the case must


6

be taken.

7

Now --

QUESTION:

At least the case in the Eleventh


8

Circuit, because it wasn't in the case.

9

case before the district court.

It wasn't in the


It was -- in the district


10

court it was just restraint as punishment.

11

this being a temporal measure to get him to go back to


12

work doesn't show up till the Eleventh Circuit, and the


13

Eleventh Circuit rejects it because it wasn't raised in


14

the district court.


15

MR. SCHLICK:

16

QUESTION:

17

The idea of


That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.


So the regulation is not before us,


you're saying.


18

MR. SCHLICK:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SCHLICK:

That's correct.


Okay.

To answer Justice Kennedy's second


21

question, how would this Court address the issue if Gates


22

v. Collier did not exist, in that case, a reasonable


23

officer -- the question would be, what would a reasonable


24

officer -- what would have been clear to a reasonable


25

officer.

The reasonable officer could have made a

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

colorable argument that the appropriate analysis is the


2

deliberate indifference standard established by this


3

Court's decision in Farmer v. Brennan, that standard being


4

whether the officer was deliberately indifferent to a


5

substantial risk of serious harm.


6

The reasonable officer could further have


7

concluded that neither the May incident in this case nor


8

the June incident in this case presented a substantial


9

risk of serious harm.


10

QUESTION:

So you think deliberately indifferent


11

is a sufficient standard for the imposition of liability


12

without more specificity.

13

their specific acts can be challenged under the general


14

standard of deliberately indifferent.


15

MR. SCHLICK:

All officers must be aware that


Yes, we think it would be


16

sufficient to establish a substantive violation of the


17

Eighth Amendment, although as the facts must be taken


18

here, qualified immunity would attach, because there's a


19

colorable argument that the threshold was not crossed, but


20

I'd want to say that this Court has not resolved whether


21

it's this deliberate indifference standard or rather the


22

Hudson v. McMillian test, the excessive force test of


23

whether force was used maliciously and sadistically to


24

inflict harm, and that is an unresolved question, is,


25

it's -- that is that very absence of certainty that would

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be most relevant absent the Gates v. Collier decision.

2

this --


3

QUESTION:

In


Suppose I think that I have to reach


4

the question of whether it would violate the Constitution,


5

not just whether the Eleventh Circuit said it would.

6

you think it would violate the Constitution to make the


7

inmate stand in a corner, to immobilize him to that


8

extent?


9
10

MR. SCHLICK:

You would need to know more,


not --


11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SCHLICK:

13

Do


To go stand in the corner.

Not in all instances, no, Your


Honor.


14

QUESTION:

So what makes the difference is, you


15

say stand in the corner, and I'm going to handcuff you,


16

and that's the difference between cruel and unusual, and


17

not cruel and unusual?


18

MR. SCHLICK:

The relevant considerations,


19

Justice Scalia, would be the degree of pain and the threat


20

to the safety of the inmates.


21

QUESTION:

It's not necessarily the degree of


22

pain.

23

not much more than standing in a corner.


24
25

Being handcuffed to some immobile object, any --


MR. SCHLICK:

The overarching question of


whether the pain was wanton and unnecessary would focus on

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the degree of pain, the penalogical justification, and the


2

threat to the inmate's safety, so you would need to know


3

the facts that bear on those inquiries.


4

In this case, as I've said, the Eleventh Circuit


5

decision of Gates v. Collier was directly on point.

6

provided sufficient certainty for the officers here, and


7

it was correct in that as applied to these facts, under


8

this Court's decisions, there was an Eighth Amendment


9

violation.


10

QUESTION:

It


I didn't understand your last


11

statement.

You say, it would depend on the facts, the


12

degree of pain, the circumstances. I thought your argument


13

for the proposition that any physical restraint as a form


14

of punishment is bad.


15

MR. SCHLICK:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SCHLICK:

18

21
22

That --


You're not.

It's the petitioner's position,


but not a position of the United States.


19
20

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Ah.

All right.

All right.

All


right.

MR. SCHLICK:

If the Court has no further


questions --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN A. FORRESTER


2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


3
4

MR. FORRESTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


5

In the last 15 years, at least eight Federal


6

master judges and eight Federal district judges in Alabama


7

have read the law to hold that handcuffing a prisoner to a


8

restraining bar or to a similar stationary object does not


9

violate the Eighth Amendment.


10

QUESTION:

Have they discussed Gates?

I didn't


11

go to look at the district court opinions, though you


12

cited them, but did those opinions discuss Gates?


13
14

MR. FORRESTER:
pointedly cite Gates.


15
16

No, Justice Souter, they didn't


QUESTION:
Circuit precedent?

17

Did they just ignore the pre-Eleventh

I mean, how did they get by without --


MR. FORRESTER:

Primarily they refer to the


18

subsequent authority in Williams v. Burton and Ort v.


19

White, and I don't think that we can presume that they


20

stargazed and ignored it, or that they just thought that


21

case really had been largely superseded by this subsequent


22

clarifying authority.


23

QUESTION:

What was the subsequent clarifying


24

authority?

Gates was a specific injunction.

25

won't use physical restraints or punishments.

It said, we

What came


26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

after from the Eleventh Circuit that modified that


2

injunction?


3

MR. FORRESTER:

Well, the proposition for which


4

petitioner's amici wish this Court to read Gates and say


5

that our respondents should have read Gates is this very


6

broad proposition that any form of restraint as a form of


7

punishment is unconstitutional, although that proposition


8

has clearly been narrowed not just by the Eleventh


9

Circuit's rulings and rulings in Williams v. Burton and


10

Ort, which indicated that certainly in an excessive force


11

context you could restrain a prisoner for a period of


12

time, but also by this Court's rulings in Wilson v. Seiter


13

and Whitley v. Albers, and the clarifying ruling in Farmer


14

v. Brennan, where this Court indicated that the fact that


15

a restraint was possibly objectively problematic is not


16

enough to create an Eighth Amendment right.

17

be --


18

QUESTION:

There had to


If we are assuming the fact as


19

alleged, as it was used here, not to quell a riot, not to


20

keep things calm in an interim, but as a means of


21

punishment -- because that's what I understood the


22

injunction in Gates was, not, you couldn't use restraints


23

in a temporary situation, but that you could not use it


24

strictly for punishment purposes --


25

MR. FORRESTER:

Well --

QUESTION:

And that, as far as I know, hasn't


been modified.


3

MR. FORRESTER:

A couple of responses to that.

as a form of punishment.

punishment.

11

refusing to work under the regulation.


12

QUESTION:

But you didn't bring up the


13

regulations in the district court.

14

Circuit said it was nowhere in the record.


15

MR. FORRESTER:

At least the Eleventh


Well, first of all we think that


16

the Court's entitled to take judicial notice of it,


17

because it is the law, that you don't have to actually


18

introduce the law into the record, but on top of that, it


19

was always in the mix.

20

log for the petitioner's first day on the bar is a copy of


21

the log that comes from the appendix to the regulations.


22

QUESTION:

The district court -- the activity


What has that got to do with it, that


23

reg?

I mean, so what?

That is, his allegation is that he


24

was left for 7 hours on a very hot day with his arms about


25

over his head, standing up, and given no water, except

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

once, so there are 3 hours at least without any water. 


2

All right, that's his allegation.


3
4
5

Now, introduce any regulation you want, why

doesn't that create an issue for trial?

MR. FORRESTER:

Well, because, the Your Honor,


6

the most important fact there is that he could have gotten


7

off the bar --


8
9
10

QUESTION:

I don't see anything, all right, that


he said that was so, and I don't see anything where

anybody in the record said that was so.


11

MR. FORRESTER:

12

QUESTION:

The regulation --


So what is the regulation?

Did you


13

move, did you say -- did you say -- I don't see in these


14

papers in front of me, say that the reason we're entitled


15

to summary judgment is, it was ordinary practice to let


16

the person go off, and then you'd cite that, and here


17

they're following ordinary practice.


18

Now, maybe then they'd have to have replied, but


19

I couldn't find anything like that.

20

that in the trial court?


21

MR. FORRESTER:

22

No, Your Honor, we didn't say


that, but it was petitioner's --


23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FORRESTER:

25

Where does it say


Then why isn't it --

Because it was petitioner's


burden, as the plaintiff, to set forth the facts that made

question is, why doesn't that -- I gave you the facts, and

The activity log, as far

as I see it, says nothing about what you're saying.

just says he was placed on a restraining bar for a fight.

MR. FORRESTER:

It refers to the two conditions


15

that are the conditions for using the restraining bar


16

under reg 429.


17

QUESTION:

Why don't you read that?


18

MR. FORRESTER:

The actual copy of this log in the record says,

says, restraining bar to be used only during daylight

with it?

MR. FORRESTER:

That refers -- that's actually


429, and that is the regulation.

QUESTION:

Okay.

Let's suppose that you're a


13

genius as a trial judge, and you happen to know that when


14

it says here AR-119 it means AR-429, okay.

15

said is, restraining bar to be used only during daylight


16

hours, cite, 429.

17

Now, what it


Now, how does that help?


MR. FORRESTER:

Well, reg 429 is what these


18

respondents were following when they put him on the bar,


19

and this petitioner has not alleged that when he was put


20

on the bar he could not have gotten off.


21

QUESTION:

Okay.

I'll take that into account.


22

My other question is whether or not it is the


23

case that any human being would know that it is cruel and


24

unusual to keep a person, if that's what happened -- it's


25

what he's alleged -- keep a person chained with his arms

1

over his head, handcuffed to a bar, for 7 hours, in the


2

hot sun, not giving him water but for once, so he goes at


3

least 3 hours without water.


4

Now, is there a case that would confuse what I


5

think would be ordinary common sense on that -- at least,


6

or tell me why that isn't ordinary common sense to think


7

that that is very cruel, and certainly an unusual thing to


8

do.


9

MR. FORRESTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Let me preface


10

my response with one quick -- he wasn't cuffed with his


11

hands over his head.

12

pictures show that in the joint appendix, but I would draw


13

Your Honor's attention to a district court opinion which


14

is transcribed in the joint appendix.

20

attention to this district court opinion that is


21

transcribed in the joint appendix at page 81.

22

entitled, Whitson v. Gillikin, and this was a 1994 case. 


23

This was 1 year before the events in this case.

24

Gates, who is one of the respondents here, was a defendant


25

in this case, and in this case the prisoner alleged that


It's

Alderson Reporting Company

he was put on the bar for 8 hours in 95-degree heat, which


2

is hotter than this case, was not given any water, was not


3

given any bathroom breaks, which has not been alleged in


4

this case.


5

The district court, or rather the magistrate


6

judge appointed counsel for this pro se litigant,


7

instructed counsel to go out and provide supplemental


8

briefing on the question of whether that circumstance


9

violated a clearly established right, and the court said,


10

I have done my own diligent search -- this is on page


11

89 -- the court has made a diligent search of the case


12

law, I requested additional brief from the parties, and


13

neither the court nor the parties have identified any


14

cases binding or otherwise in this circuit in which it was


15

found that the Eighth Amendment as violated in these


16

circumstances.


17

Now, we submit that if you have a learned


18

authority such as this reading the law that carefully and


19

not finding it in this manner, it would be exceedingly


20

unfair to hold our respondents --

careless for the counsel who was appointed not to bring

that to the magistrate judge's attention.


5

MR. FORRESTER:

Your Honor, in 28 years since

that they didn't write it up, and furthermore it wasn't

would it be to show an entry in the activity log?

all, the prisoner doesn't -- is not the custodian of that

MR. FORRESTER:

Yes.

We attempted to find it,


2

and just couldn't find it, and these three respondents,


3

moreover, were not personally responsible for the activity

5

weren't the one supervising him, and they weren't

responsible for his custody after it was kept.

10

They weren't responsible for keeping it because they


QUESTION:

They weren't responsible for how long


he was left on the bar, either.

MR. FORRESTER:
QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.


Which makes me wonder whether it was


11

your burden to bring in the regulation or, rather, whether


12

it was the burden of the plaintiff to show that these


13

defendants, when they put him on the bar, knew that he


14

would be left on the bar for 7 hours, and if that was


15

their burden, it seems to me it's not up to you to


16

volunteer the defense which is in the public record, that


17

in fact, if the prison policy was followed, he wouldn't


18

have been left there for 7 hours as soon as he agreed to


19

go back to the work crew.


20

QUESTION:

But it's your position, I take it,


21

that so long as the regulation was in place so that he


22

could go back to work, that the State could legitimately


23

keep him --


24

MR. FORRESTER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.


-- hanging to this rail for as long

1

as it takes, no matter how hot it is, and without water,


2

for as long as the State chooses to use it, just so long


3

as the regulation is there that says, you can go back to


4

work?


5

MR. FORRESTER:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. FORRESTER:

8

Is that your position?


QUESTION:

10

Well, like this.


MR. FORRESTER:

QUESTION:

13

MR. FORRESTER:

All right.

-- where he can stand fully


erect --


15
16

Chest high -- chest high, like


this --


12

14

No, Your Honor, not hanging from


the rail.


9

11

No, Your Honor. 


QUESTION:

In this case, handcuffed to the


rail --


17

MR. FORRESTER:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.


-- for as long as the State wishes


19

without administration of water or bathroom breaks, just


20

because there's a regulation that says he can go back to


21

work.

22
23
24
25

That's your position?

MR. FORRESTER:

No, Your Honor.

The regulation


clearly entitles him to regular water and bathroom breaks.

QUESTION:

But the allegations are that he was


not given water and not given bathroom breaks.

We take


37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those allegations as true for purposes of a summary


2

judgment motion.


3

MR. FORRESTER:

No, Your Honor, he did not


4

allege, ever, nor present evidence that he was denied a


5

bathroom break, and he did not allege that he was denied


6

water.

7

these two other defendant, nondefendant officers, who are


8

clearly not these three respondents, deprived him of water


9

and -- you know, in acts --


10
11
12

He simply said that during one 3-hour stretch


QUESTION:

-- certainly in the hot sun for 3


hours without water is fine.
MR. FORRESTER:

That's fine?


If it is being done because he


13

has refused to work -- and I would hasten to add, Your


14

Honor, this is --


15

QUESTION:

But we have nothing in the record, as


16

I understand it, to indicate that.

17

as I understand it, is that's what the regulation makes


18

clear, that that's why they were doing it, but the


19

regulation is not on the record, and I don't see any basis


20

upon which a United States district court is required to


21

take judicial notice of every State's prison regulations


22

if the State doesn't want to put it into the record.


23

MR. FORRESTER:

Your position on that,


Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, I


24

would note that even in the absence of the regulation the


25

district court didn't find his allegations in evidence

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sufficient to make out a claim that would withstand


2

qualified immunity, so introducing that only makes the


3

case all that stronger, but I would hasten to add that the


4

Court did make a finding that he was put on the bar


5

because he was disruptive to the work crew -- work squad. 


6

That is the condition in the regulations.

7

on the bar for a strictly punitive purpose in the sense


8

that petitioners are arguing --


9

QUESTION:

He was not put


Can you help me with this, Mr.


10

Forrester?

The assumption seems to be in the State's


11

argument that if you restrain a person in order to -- then


12

choose the word, convince, coerce him to do something,


13

that is not punishment.

14

punishment was rehabilitation, or corrections, as well as


15

deterrence and prevention.


16

MR. FORRESTER:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

I thought one of the purposes of


Yes, Your Honor.


Why isn't this punishment if you're


doing this in order to have him comply with your command?

MR. FORRESTER:

Yes, Your Honor, it is certainly


20

punishment in the broad sense.

For instance, it is a part


21

of prison life.

22

analyzed as to whether it's cruel and unusual, but in the


23

narrow sense in which they are using it, and in the narrow


24

sense in which Ort v. White sought to distinguish


25

punishment from what it termed an immediately necessary


We're not saying that it shouldn't be

1

coercive measure, this requires --


2

QUESTION:

Yes, but Mr. Schlick, can I just ask


3

you about the case you called our attention to on page 89-


4

90 of the -- and there, according to the magistrate


5

judge's opinion, Judge Putman, in that case the plaintiff


6

was refusing to check out in his work detail, but then he


7

gave him the choice of either working or being handcuffed


8

to the security bar.

9

case, is there?


10
11

There's no such allegation in this


MR. FORRESTER:

Petitioner never alleged that he


couldn't have gotten off the bar --


12

QUESTION:

But you didn't allege that you gave


13

him the choice, did you?


14

MR. FORRESTER:

The petitioner bears the burden,


15

as the plaintiff, to say I could not have gotten off the


16

bar if I had asked for it.


17

QUESTION:

I must say, I can't understand why


18

that wasn't put in by the State.

I can't -- I cannot


19

imagine why the State did not raise that point, that he


20

could have gotten off the bar at any time by just saying,


21

I'll go back to work.

22

that?


Why -- what's your explanation for


23

MR. FORRESTER:

Well, it is a regrettable --


24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FORRESTER: -- litigation error.


Regrettable, it's incomprehensible.


40
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

Why doesn't the -- Ort, which you say


2

he's the magistrate on page 89 and 90, supports your


3

position.

4

Government in support of its position, and I suppose the


5

reason is because they make very clear in that case that


6

it was unusual to deprive a person of water, and in that


7

circumstance, absolutely necessary, and so how, in this


8

circumstance, was it necessary to do what he says they


9

did?


10

Interestingly enough, that case is cited by the


I was deprived of water, was teased by two


11

officers when I asked for water, on one occasion they


12

started to bring me water but ended up giving it to some


13

dogs, I was given some once or twice during 7 hours, but


14

that was not enough, and at one point during the hottest


15

part of the day I was left without water for at least 3


16

hours.


17

All right, so for a person reading the case of


18

Ort, and then reading that, you would think that Ort


19

actually supports the Government, not you, because --


20

unless, of course, there's some reason that behavior like


21

that, if it occurred, would have been necessary, so what


22

is the necessity, or what can you say about it?


23

MR. FORRESTER:

Well, I would hasten to add,


24

Your Honor, those allegations that you keep reading again


25

are not alleged against our three respondents.

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

That's, of course, what you say, but


2

what the allegation says is that it was your three


3

respondents.

4

specifically on that is, he says, I believe that the


5

officer who actually put me on the hitching post was


6

defendant Sergeant Mark Pelzer.

7

was put there by defendant Gates, and an officer named


8

Mark Dempsey, and then McClaran wrote the report, and in


9

McClaran's reply he suggests he was there, and so I don't


In -- on -- in the affidavit what he says


However, a report says I


10

see any denial here by your particular clients that they


11

were not responsible for this, and he alleges they were.


12

QUESTION:

Would that be your burden?

Is that


13

their burden to say, I was not responsible, or is it the


14

plaintiff's burden to say, you were responsible for not


15

giving me water?


16

QUESTION:

That's not there.

The language I


17

read was the plaintiff's affidavit saying they were


18

responsible in his opinion.


19
20

QUESTION:

Responsible for putting him onto the


post.


21

MR. FORRESTER:

We do believe it was the


22

plaintiff's burden, Justice Breyer.

The excerpt you just


23

read actually refers to the first day he was on the bar,


24

May 11.

25

bar, but it is no way clear from that that either Pelzer


The second day was not when Pelzer put him on the


42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

or Gates, who it would appear put him on the bar, stuck


2

around after that.


3

QUESTION:

It's an important point for me.

4

still don't understand why coercion to comply with an


5

order by a restraint is not a punishment.


6

MR. FORRESTER:

I


We do think it's punishment in a


7

broad sense.

8

point I'm trying to respond to is their contention


9

basically that there was no valid penalogical purpose for


10

putting him on the restraining bar, that this was somehow


11

arbitrary or retaliative, or retributive and not remedial,

which was the purpose.

That's trying to make too fine a point.

into the altercation, actually getting to the point where

QUESTION:

Mr. Schaerr, We'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR

ON BEHALF OF MISSOURI, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE,


6
7
8

Thank you, Mr. Forrester.


SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

MR. SCHAERR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


9

We believe this case is controlled by any of


10

three common sense principles of law, each of which is


11

essential if this Court's qualified immunity doctrine is


12

to prevent the problems that it was designed to prevent.


13

The first is that where personal liability is at


14

stake, public officials shouldn't be expected to be more


15

adept at construing case law than the State court judges


16

whose decisions are reviewed in Federal habeas


17

proceedings.


18

Now, the United States appears to adopt a


19

standard that would be equivalent functionally to the


20

standard that this Court has already adopted in the habeas


21

context, and we think the United States' argument in this


22

point is correct, and in fact we believe the Court has


23

already come close to adopting that standard in the


24

Saucier decision, which said the proper inquiry is whether


25

the case on which a plaintiff relies occurred, and I

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

quote, under facts not distinguishable in a fair way from


2

the facts presented in the case at hand.

3

that is just another way of saying that the facts of the


4

two cases can't be materially indistinguishable.


5

QUESTION:

It seems to me


Well, let me ask you a different


6

question, though.

7

between materially similar, which was used here, and


8

fundamentally similar, which was disapproved in Lanier?


9

What's the conceptual difference


MR. SCHAERR:

Well, as I understand, the


10

fundamentally similar requirement required a much tighter


11

fit between the facts of the two cases than the materially


12

similar standard does, and I think --


13

QUESTION:

I mean, maybe you're right, but I


14

don't know that from looking at the two words.

15

sounds to me as though materially and fundamentally are


16

substantially similar.


17

(Laughter.)


18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SCHAERR:

20

QUESTION:

I mean, it


I mean, I --

And not materially -- you got it.


But it's splitting it pretty fine, it


21

seems to me, and wouldn't it be better, wouldn't it serve


22

clarity better if we in effect said in this case, look,


23

stop paraphrasing the standard, and just stick to the


24

basic standard, and that is, would it be clear to a


25

reasonable officer?

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, it seems to me, Justice


2

Souter, the way you answer that question is, you look at


3

the case law, and that's what at issue here.

4

allegation that the text of the Eighth Amendment or that


5

any statute bars the conduct at issue here.


6

QUESTION:

There's no


So you're saying regardless of how


7

they paraphrased it, when you get down to the district


8

court cases, on any standard, they ought to win.

9

it.

10

That's


You're not resting anything on materially similar as


the right way to describe it.


11

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, I think it is important and


12

useful for this Court to make the link to the habeas


13

context, because I think that would provide greater


14

clarity in the law, and the ultimate standard under this


15

Court's decisions is whether official action violated


16

clearly established law.


17

Well, that's the exact -- that's exactly the


18

same phrase that's used in the habeas statute, and that


19

this Court has interpreted in Williams and Penry II as


20

meaning materially indistinguishable, and it would be


21

useful, and I think quite productive to apply that in this


22

context as well, and would bring greater clarity to the


23

law.


24
25

QUESTION:

But isn't that -- isn't it a concern


for the State court, because here we're talking about an

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

officer, and did he follow what was an Eleventh Circuit


2

decision.


3

MR. SCHAERR:

4

QUESTION:

Right.


There, we're talking about a Federal


5

court overriding a determination by a State court, so I


6

don't think the settings are similar.

7

particular concern that the habeas statute reflects, and


8

that is not overriding a State court's determination.


9

MR. SCHAERR:

There's a


Sure, but -- and I agree the two


10

situations are not entirely identical, but if anything it


11

seems to me the section 1983 context raises even greater


12

federalism concerns, because as this Court recognized a


13

couple of terms ago in Geyer v. Honda, litigation can


14

often be the functional equivalent of a statutory -- of a


15

statute or a regulation, and so what happens in the 1983


16

context, as illustrated in this case, is that courts


17

articulate broad rules that purport to govern the conduct,


18

the day-to-day conduct of elected and nonelected State


19

officials, and so it seems to me if anything the


20

federalism concerns are greater.


21

In another important way, public officials,


22

nonlawyer, nonjudge public officials are at a disadvantage


23

and that, as this Court noted in Saucier, and I quote,


24

public officials are often forced to make split-second


25

judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

rapidly evolving, unlike judges, who can take all the time


2

they want sometimes to --


3
4

QUESTION:
split-second.

5

Yes, but wait a minute, this is not


We're talking 7 hours here.


MR. SCHAERR:

I agree with that, Justice


6

O'Connor, but the standard, it seems to me, needs to apply


7

to the full range of official action that would be covered


8

by 1983.


9

QUESTION:

Yes, but you have to ask whether a


10

reasonable officer in these circumstances would have known


11

that what was done was unconstitutional.


12

MR. SCHAERR:

I think that ultimately is the


13

answer, and it seems to me the way you answer that is


14

asking the question posed in Saucier, of whether the two


15

cases are materially -- well, are -- whether there's a


16

fair distinction between the two cases, which seems to me


17

amounts to material distinction.


18

QUESTION:

If you're requested to advise the


19

correctional officers in your State as to the standard,


20

the constitutional standard they must observe with


21

reference to restraining inmates, and circumstances like


22

these, what is the standard that you tell them they must


23

follow?


24
25

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, I don't think that's clear


from this Court's decisions at this point, as the United

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

States --


2

QUESTION:

Well, they come to you, and you're


3

their attorney, and you have to figure out what we mean up


4

here.


5

MR. SCHAERR:

6

(Laughter.)


7

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, at --


At worst -- at worst I would tell


8

them they have to follow the standard in Farmer.

That is,


9

their actions can't be objectively cruel, but they also --


10

they also cannot act with a subjective awareness of a


11

serious harm to the inmates, and it seems to me that's the


12

key distinction in this case between Gates, or the key


13

reason why Gates is not controlling here.


14

Gates was decided long before Whitley and Farmer and


15

all of those decisions that made clear the subjective


16

requirement in the Eighth Amendment, and indeed if you


17

look at the Eleventh Circuit's opinion, there's not even a


18

finding of any awareness of serious harm that would come


19

to these inmates.

20

serious harm requirement, and so it seems to me Gates,


21

based on this court's current cases, Gates is easily


22

distinguishable, and can't be taken as controlling here.


23
24
25

They just completely overlooked the


Now, the second principle that I'd like to

address is the principle --

QUESTION:

Well, I don't see in Gates -- and I'm

49

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reading from page 1306, where they talk about being put in


2

awkward positions, though.


3

MR. SCHAERR:

4

QUESTION:

5

serious harm to the inmates.


6

Right.


I don't see any requirement of


MR. SCHAERR:

Well, that's right, and that's why


7

it seems to me Gates had been overtaken by this Court's


8

subsequent decisions and therefore was not -- was no


9

longer binding, even if you take it on the terms that the


10

petitioner was --


11

QUESTION:

What decision --


12

QUESTION:

Yes, what --


13

QUESTION:

-- of this Court do you rely on as


14
15

changing what Gates said?

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, Farmer added a new


16

requirement.

17

other decisions that preceded it added a requirement of


18

subjective awareness of a risk of serious harm.

19

didn't impose that kind of requirement at all, and


20

therefore once this Court's decisions made clear that that


21

subjective requirement was present, Gates, it seems to me,


22

could no longer be regarded as controlling in this


23

situation, even if you interpret Gates on its own terms.


24

as the petitioner would have you.


25

Well, not just Farmer, but Farmer and the


QUESTION:

Gates


Well, even if that were a

50

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

requirement, you think the allegations here don't suffice?


2

MR. SCHAERR:

3

QUESTION:

No, I don't.

At worst, the --


That one would not -- a reasonable


4

person would not be aware that you couldn't restrain


5

someone on a post or rail for 7 hours in the heat, without


6

water more than every 3 hours?


7

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, I think the question is


8

whether the harm that you could foresee from that -- and


9

the record does not suggest that he was without water.

He


10

says that he received water only once or twice during that


11

7-hour period.

12

for 24 hours.


Lots of people go without water and food


13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SCHAERR:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SCHAERR:

17

I'm sorry.


Also no bathroom breaks for 7 hours.

There's no allegation of that in


his affidavit.


18
19

Yes, but also no bathroom breaks.


QUESTION:

Well, the court of appeals said there


was.


20

MR. SCHAERR:

The court of appeals made a


21

mistake, and this Court has the ability to review the


22

summary judgment record de novo, and it's not a long


23

record.


24
25

But that leads me to the -- to my second

principle, and that is that a public official shouldn't be

51
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

held liable under section 1983, or shouldn't be stripped


2

of his or her qualified immunity except on the basis of


3

his or her own actions based on reasonable inferences from


4
