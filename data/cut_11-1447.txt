CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear 


4

argument next this morning in Case 11-1447,

Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District.

6

Mr. Beard?

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. BEARD, II,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BEARD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

This case is about the extent to which

12

Nollan and Dolan review should be made available to

13

individuals to challenge excessive exactions imposed as

14

conditions to land use approval.
Here, before he could make small use of his

15
16

property, Coy Koontz was told by the district that he

17

had to finance enhancements to 50 acres of publicly

18

held --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's back up.

When he

20

asked for a permit, he voluntarily said, I -- as

21

mitigation for the loss of wetlands, I am going to

22

voluntarily create a conservation easement on the rest

23

of my property.

24

there had to be some mitigation for what he was seeking

25

to do in the permit.

So he recognized, from day one, that

Is that right?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BEARD:

That is correct.

With his

2

application, Justice Ginsburg, he did offer a mitigation

3

in the form of a conservation easement on most of his

4

property.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if he had offered

6

nothing, and he just said, I want this permit to develop

7

my land, and the agency said, you have offered no

8

mitigation, we deny your permit, would he have a claim?

9

MR. BEARD:

If there was no condition

10

attached to the permit denial, then there would be no

11

claim; although it would be up to the district, under

12

Nollan and Dolan, to make the individualized

13

determination, both of the amount of impact to wetlands

14

and the amount necessary to offset.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

Suppose he just put in

16

the application, no mitigating -- no mitigation of any

17

kind, and the agency says no.

18

would have no claim, right?

19

to mitigate.

20

MR. BEARD:

You recognize that he
That he had an obligation

It depends, Your Honor.

If the

21

denial was based on the idea that he was obligated to

22

offer mitigation and that was the extent of the

23

district's communication with him -- in other words,

24

that the district told him, you must offer us something,

25

we won't tell you what, and we'll let you decide what
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you want to offer in mitigation -- if that was in the

2

record and that was the -- and the result of that was a

3

permit denial because Mr. Koontz said, for example,

4

well, gee whiz, I don't know how much I need to mitigate

5

for, you haven't told me, I still believe there would be

6

a Dolan violation because, in Dolan, the Court made

7

clear, there has to be an individualized

8

determination --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For what?

For what?

You

wouldn't -- you wouldn't know what property was taken.

11

MR. BEARD:

He wouldn't know where --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You are -- you are posing a

13

situation in which he never came forward with any

14

suggestion.

They never came forward with any

15

suggestion.

You say he still has a cause of action for

16

a taking?

17

MR. BEARD:

Not for --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. BEARD:

A taking of what?

Not for a taking, Your Honor,

20

but he -- he may have a cause of action, under Nollan

21

and Dolan, for the imposition of an unconstitutional

22

condition that may not -- the contours of which may not

23

be known.

But the fact that the district told him, you

2

MR. BEARD:

Excuse me.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't understand?

Wouldn't -- wouldn't the

4

other side in this case acknowledge that you have such a

5

cause -- that you may have such a cause of action here?

6
7

MR. BEARD:

I believe

they -- well, their argument --

8
9

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But they are just saying

you don't have a cause of action for a taking.
MR. BEARD:

That is correct.

They -- they

11

are saying that we don't have a cause of action for a

12

taking.

13

transfer of property from the applicant to the relevant

14

agencies.

Of course, in Nollan and Dolan, there was no

As this Court will recall, in both Nollan

15
16

and Dolan, there was an imposition of an exaction, and

17

immediately, the applicant in both cases sued to prevent

18

the unlawful exaction from being consummated.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I've had a

20

problem with your argument, okay?

21

very clear that a conservation offer is not considered

22

mitigation because there's still a net loss of wetlands.

23

The policy is abundantly clear, stated, and undisputed.

24

Okay?

25

From the record, it's

So, given that policy, why are we even in
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this case?

Meaning whether there was an exaction or no

2

exaction or whatever happened in terms of the denial,

3

you couldn't win on your offer because the policy of the

4

State was clear and, in my mind, unassailable:

5

to preserve wetlands.

6

not enough.

7

net gain of wetlands.

We have

Conservation of other wetlands is

Mitigation means make sure that we get a

8

So why are we here?

9

MR. BEARD:

Justice Sotomayor, we don't

10

contest the legitimacy of the policy, of course, in

11

preserving wetlands; nor do we contest, for that matter,

12

the ratios that the district has imposed via its

13

regulations.

14

It is undisputed -- the trial court found

15

below, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and the finding

16

was undisturbed in the Florida Supreme Court, that, in

17

fact, the offsite mitigation -- that part of the

18

mitigation that went beyond the conservation easement

19

was in excess, it violated Nollan and Dolan.
So the underlying factual findings are not

20
21
22

in dispute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think you -- I think

23

you have a problem then, Mr. Beard, because, if you look

24

at the record, the record is very clear that it was

25

not -- that the district didn't come back and say, take
7

Alderson Reporting Company

2

get no permit.

3

There was -- and if you -- they are set out

4

in the Respondent's brief at pages 13 to 15, oh, at

5

least half a dozen, maybe more, that the -- the district

6

said, here are several ways -- several ways that you

7

could sufficiently offset the adverse impact.

8

of them had nothing to do with improving the

9

government's own land.

And some

So if we can't -- we really can't say this

10
11

was a take it or leave it, either you do the

12

improvement that we are asking you to do, or you get no

13

permit, what do you do with the fact that, as the

14

appendix certainly bears out, that the district offered

15

a range, it offered many, many ways that this permit

16

might be granted.

17

to come up with some other -- something else.

18

And then it says, then you are free

MR. BEARD:

Justice Ginsburg, it's true that

there were negotiations and that a range of offers were

20

made.

21

his property in conjunction with the conservation

22

easement, the district made a final decision denying him

23

his permit because he would not go beyond the easement

24

and offer offsite mitigation.

25

On Mr. Koontz's application to use 3.7 acres of

And that is -8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not -- not -- because he

2

wouldn't go beyond what he was offering, but that's --

3

some of these options -- one was that he -- that he

4

adjust the size of his project, that he make it smaller.

5

The -- the staff suggested eliminating -- no, that --

6

that's a different one.

7

But there was one that suggested that he --

8

he reduce the scale, the Petitioner reduce the scale of

9

his project to one acre and preserve the rest for the

10

conservation easement.

11

would you have any -- any case here?

MR. BEARD:

Now, if that -- if he took that,

I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?

If

we took -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If they said, we will

15

give you -- we will give you a permit if you reduce the

16

scale of your project to one acre, and then preserve the

17

rest by a conservation easement?

18

MR. BEARD:

Unlikely not, Your Honor,

19

because the trial court did conclude, based on the

20

evidence, that he was having minimal impact on any

21

viable wetlands.

22

the project, with an increase in the amount of

23

mitigation, would have a fortiori gone beyond even what

24

we have in this case.

25

And so even a reduction in the size of

The court of appeals made clear, as a matter

of law, that Mr. Koontz did -- was entitled to a

2

determination on the application he submitted.

submitted that application.

4

admitted in a pretrial statement right before trial, the

5

denials were based exclusively -- and this is a quote --

7

plaintiff would not provide additional mitigation to

8

offset impacts from the proposed project."

JUSTICE KAGAN:

He

And, as the district

Mr. Beard, can I go back to

10

Justice Ginsburg's first question and make sure I

11

understand your answer to it?

12

Suppose that the State just had a policy

13

that said, We're concerned about wetlands; in order to

14

develop your piece of property, you have to come forward

15

with a proposal -- a mitigation proposal and an adequate

16

mitigation proposal.

17

about what an adequate mitigation proposal would mean,

18

but it really leaves it up to the landowner.

19

And then it gives some guidance

And the landowner says, sorry, I'm not

20

giving you anything, I think I should be able to develop

21

this on my own without providing any mitigation.

22

that -- and -- and the State says, well, then, sorry,

23

you don't get a permit.

24
25

Is that a taking?
takings claim?

Is

Does the man have a

I heard you answer the question yes.
10

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BEARD:

My answer was that he may have a

2

Nollan/Dolan claim.

3

the term "taking" because "taking" could imply many

4

kinds of regulatory takings claims.

5

I don't want to get confused about

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I -- that's the next

6

question I was going to ask you because my understanding

7

of Nollan and Dolan was that it assumed the condition,

8

if taken alone, would constitute a taking.

9

Do you disagree with that?

10
11

MR. BEARD:

I do not disagree with that,

Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So then you need a

13

taking someplace in the picture; isn't that right?

14

Nollan/Dolan says this is how we analyze takings in the

15

context of a permit scheme.

16

taking.

17
18
19

So we have to look for a

So, in my example, where is the taking?
This was Justice Ginsburg's example. Where

is the taking?
MR. BEARD:

Right.

And I think that's

20

correct, that, under Nollan and Dolan, you would have to

21

have a condition that was imposed on you.

22

My only point was would it be lawful --

23

or there be a problem in the district shifting its

24

burden on to the applicant and saying, we're not going

25

to establish what mitigation is required, and we're not

26

going to establish what the impacts are, we'll leave
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that up to you, you give us what you think is -- is

2

necessary.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the district

4

did -- did have, as I think it did here, a uniform

5

policy that, for every acre you develop, you have to

6

preserve 10 wetlands -- 10 acres of wetlands.

7

And then two cases, both hypothetical, one

8

is somebody had an 100-acre parcel, and they want to

9

develop five acres, and they have 50 acres that they

10

mitigate for wetlands.

11

acre, and he wants to -- and he has to develop the whole

12

acre.

13

The other person has only one

Can the district then say, we'll give you

14

the one-acre development permit, if you reclaim wetlands

15

on 10 other acres that you -- that we can designate for

16

you elsewhere?

17

out whether or not the crux of your argument is that he

18

had to go off -- offsite.

19

The hypothetical being designed to point

MR. BEARD:

The crux is not that he had to

20

go offsite, but that -- that did play into the trial

21

court's analysis as to the connection between his impact

22

and what was being required, and there was testimony

23

below that there was no connection there.

24

that the mitigation was four to seven miles away played

25

into the analysis as to whether there was a connection.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, in my hypothetical,

3

you would -- would there be a violation in my

4

hypothetical, as you understood it?

5

MR. BEARD:

It depends, Your Honor, because

6

you have to determine what -- in each respective

7

hypothetical, what the impact was actually to the

8

wetlands and then determine what the appropriate

9

mitigation -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

How do you normally

decide whether the agency has done that right or not?

How do you normally

arbitrary and capricious, whether it was a Penn Central

24
25

What would you do with that claim in the
Justice Kennedy's question.

MR. BEARD:

In the normal circumstance, if

there was no condition imposed, there would not be a

Nollan and Dolan claim.

2

claim, say, under Penn Central, and that could be

3

brought.

4

administrative remedies, if there was a final agency

5

action --

That wouldn't have to be brought via

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It would be an inverse

condemnation.

8
9

There may be another kind of

MR. BEARD:

Correct.

It could be an inverse

condemnation type of a claim.
JUSTICE BREYER:

10

So -- so what I think might

11

be driving some of these questions is the district court

12

says -- just as you say, had Koontz offered additional

13

mitigation -- the additional that would have cost

14

$10,000, he would have gotten the permit.

15

he said.

16

That's what

So then you look back to see what additional

17

mitigation.

And, here, we have in the record, at least

18

that my law clerk finds -- you know, that -- that they

19

went to Koontz and they said, here are some choices:

20

Install a subsurface stormwater management system in the

21

development -- I mean, right on your land -- or reduce

22

the size to one acre; or eliminate the filling of the

23

slide slope areas; or replace 15 culverts and eliminate

24

a ditch system somewhere else; or enhance 50 acres

25

somewhere else.

If, after all, they said you have to

13

terrible, they don't do it for anybody else, your

14

client's the only one, it bears no relation, oh, it just

So I can see the framework here.

I'm not

17

saying you're going to win, but I got it clear what the

framework is.

business into it, and I get confused.

20

because there was a different piece of land in Nollan

21

and Dolan.

22

But suddenly you bring this Nollan/Dolan
And the reason is

The piece of land that was different was an

23

easement in front of -- and an easement is a piece of

24

property in Nollan, and there was a bike path in Dolan,

25

right across his property.
15

Alderson Reporting Company

So -- so I don't see how Nollan and Dolan

have to do with this.

Central has to do with it, and that grows out of the

nature of what was being offered.

5

they are offering you is simply going too far.

I've got that conceptually.

7

I see everything that Penn

You are saying what

and that's why I am asking you.

11

MR. BEARD:

Justice Breyer --

12

Justice Breyer, Nollan and Dolan, fundamentally, are

13

about whether a property owner has been singled out to

14

bear public burdens that, in fairness and -JUSTICE BREYER:

But, of course, they are

land claims because they took a piece of land, which

everybody assumes -- right in front of his house -- and

19

back and forth from one beach in the north to another

20

one in the south, and they are going to walk over your

land.

And the Court said, you can't take his land

related to his building the house.

part, a very distinct part, and that part goes to the

19

question of the condition that produced the denial.

20

there are -- there are actually two parts here.

21

the -- the conditioning of your permit; in other words,

22

we will not issue you permits unless you agree to

23

perform offsite mitigation.

24
25

So

There's

Now, the question, under Nollan and Dolan,
is was that condition constitutional?
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Was he asked to

Official

1

give up something that the State -- or the district, in

2

this case, should not have asked him to give up in

3

exchange for his right to use his property?

4

Now, it's true as -- as, Justice Breyer, you

5

mentioned, that the permit denial and whether that

6

affects a regulatory taking of his land, of the thing he

7

wants to use, that's an entirely different question.

8

And it may raise another kind of claim -- another kind

9

of taking claim.

10

But the crux of the claim that was litigated

11

in this case, from the trial court all the way up to the

12

Florida Supreme Court, is was the condition to perform

13

offsite mitigation -- and that was accepted as true by

14

the courts below, that this was a condition that had

15

been --

Suppose the record just

20

to do -- anything off his own property.

21

They gave him a laundry list of things he

Suppose the -- whatever the district court

might have said, the record shows that the agency said,

23

you're right, seven things you could do, come up with

24

25

them have absolutely nothing to do with other
21

Alderson Reporting Company

And some of

properties.

2

MR. BEARD:

We agree that there were

3

negotiations and that, even in the order, it's alleged

4

that various options were provided to Mr. Koontz, but,

5

ultimately, the decision -- as the district admits, the

6

decision -- the final decision to deny the permit

7

application for 3.7 acres of use was Mr. Koontz's

8

refusal to acquiesce in the condition that he perform

9

50 acres of offsite improvements.

10

And, by the way, the reference --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. BEARD:

Where -- where is that?

It's in the Joint Appendix,

13

pages 70 to 71, which is the pretrial statement where

14

each party sets forth his and her position.

15

court -- I'm sorry -- the district made clear that the

16

condition that had been refused and was the cause of the

17

permit denial was the one to perform offsite mitigation

18

at a cost of a range between $10,000 on the low end.

19

Our experts said in the range of 100 to 150,000 -- 90 to

20

150,000.

21

There, the

So the district, later on -- even in the

22

Florida Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg, said, in its

23

Petitioner's brief on jurisdiction, at page 1, that it

24

required additional mitigation before it would authorize

25

the permits and that, quote, "Additional mitigation
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be offsite because the available conservation land

2

onsite was, in the district's view, insufficient

3

mitigation."

4

So there's no question that an actual

5

condition was imposed, whose rejection produced a permit

6

denial.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -- Mr. Beard, I don't

8

think anybody is contesting that there was a condition

9

imposed or maybe there are.

But -- you know, there's

10

another question whether that condition is a taking.

And

11

we've been trying to figure out what's the taking here.

12

In Nollan and Dolan, they took an easement, they took a

13

piece of land, so that's the taking.

14

funds are the taking; is that correct?

Now, you said the

Any time that somebody comes up with a

15
16

proposal for -- for a developer to pay money, in order

17

to compensate the State for the costs that are

18

associated with his development, that that is, itself, a

19

taking?
MR. BEARD:

20

I want to be clear that we're

21

not saying that all monetary fees or exactions would be

22

subject to Nollan and Dolan, only within the permit

23

context -- the special context of land use permitting is

24

it --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I understand.
23


Alderson Reporting Company

But, in

Official

1

the permit context, a State can't say to somebody, you

2

have to pay to perform some service or to compensate

3

without it being a taking and without it being subject

4

to Nollan and Dolan analysis.

5

MR. BEARD:

Correct.

If the State or if the

6

government or the permitting authority asks for the --

7

for the property owner to give up property, even money

8

to be put to a public use, and it's not an application

9

for your user fee or something like that, it's for

10

mitigation, that should be subject --

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- so, for example -- and

12

I'll try to do this very quickly, if -- if the State

13

just had a policy for every acre of wetlands you fill

14

in, it costs us $10,000, you need to pay $10,000, that's

15

subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis, too.

16

MR. BEARD:

Correct.

It would be subject to

17

Nollan and Dolan analysis, to determine if there really,

18

on the ground, there's a connection between the

19

No, it -- it would be

subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis if they took the

24

the -- the bank account in the amount of $10,000 or

25

whatever, that would be Nollan -- in Nollan and Dolan --

If they issued the permit, the developer went

He had gone ahead with the -- with the

3

development of his house under the permit, which said,

there was a -- a taking there.

So there --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The parties agree that Florida may require a

21

landowner to perform mitigation as a condition for a

22

permit that would allow the destruction of a wetlands.

23

The parties disagreed as to how much mitigation was

24

appropriate in this case.

25

The district thought that Mr. Koontz's
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

proposal was insufficient to mitigate the -- the damage

2

to wetlands.

3

counterproposals, and he refused to do anything more.

4

And the district denied his permit application because

5

he refused to do anything more.

6

Mr. Koontz rejected the district's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does it make any

7

difference, in his refusing to do anything more, whether

8

the condition is onsite or offsite?

9

MR. WOLFSON:

I don't think it makes any

10

difference, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, the -- under the

11

Florida regulatory regime, we cannot demand certain

12

conditions from the landowner.

13

The -- we are obligated -- if the -- if the

14

permit -- the landowner has to establish, under his

15

permit application -- and it's his burden -- that he

16

meets the various standards -- the public interest

17

standard, which includes no adverse impact --

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Those are all

State -- State law provisions you are talking about.

20

MR. WOLFSON:

Correct.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.
What about is

22

there -- is there anything in the Federal Constitution

23

that limits the conditions that you can demand?

24

MR. WOLFSON:

I don't -- not -- not -- if I

understand your question, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

2

think so.
I think that the question is -- when you are

3

talking about what analytical rubric you should apply,

4

whether it be Nollan or Dolan or Penn Central, I think

5

you can always argue that the impact of any of the

6

conditions that we would demand -- and I will assume

7

here that they are true demands -- you can always argue

8

that the impact of the conditions, be they onsite,

9

offsite, or monetary, would be so burdensome that it

10
11

would call into play Penn Central or -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's -- but

12

there is no -- there is no restraint on the agency.

13

can ask for the moon -- before it will give a permit?

14

MR. WOLFSON:

It

Well, I don't -- I think that

15

Penn -- first of all, I think there are many restraints

16

on the agency.

17

imposes a restraint on the agency.

20

First of all, I think Penn Central

Do you know of any

case where the government has lost a Penn Central case?
MR. WOLFSON:

In -- yes.

There are several

21

in this case, Mr. Chief Justice.

I mean, Hodel v.

22

Irving is a Penn Central case, I believe, and I think

23

Kaiser-Aetna was also a Penn Central case.

24

Now, they -- now, they -- so --

6

So it does -- it certainly 


CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't happen 


very often.
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, it is -- certainly, the

7

burden is on the landowner, but -- but I think that Penn

8

Central -- I think that, in Lingle, when this Court tried to

9

sort of restore -- you know, some -- some coherence to

10

the -- to the takings jurisprudence and repudiated the

11

Agins point, the Court pointed out that -- that the --

12

what -- that the normal -- sort of the normal

13

jurisprudence is that the government is not required to

14

establish, by a heightened scrutiny, sort of that there

15

is a connection between means-ends analysis, when it

16

engages in economic -- economic regulation.

17

And that --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just -- just to nail

19

it down, your -- your position is that there is no limit

20

in the Federal Constitution on what the agency can

21

demand as a condition for the issuance of a permit?

22

MR. WOLFSON:

No, no, no.

I don't think

23

that is our position.

First of all, the Due Process

24

Clause may certainly impose conditions.

25

Protection Clause may certainly impose conditions.
30

Alderson Reporting Company

The Equal

And --

2
3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but the

Takings -- the Takings Clause does not.

4

MR. WOLFSON:

If -- if the conditions are so

5

onerous that it would make it essentially impossible to

6

derive any value from the land, that may very well call

7

into question Penn Central or Lucas.

8

ways, this case could have been litigated as a very

9

straightforward Penn Central case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

I mean, in many

Suppose -- suppose the

11

agency said, we are really short of revenue; we will let

12

you develop your land, if you contribute a million

13

dollars to our new football stadium?

14

MR. WOLFSON:

Justice Kennedy, I think that

15

that might very well raise a Penn Central or Lucas claim.

16

It also sounds like --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

Central.

19

Penn Central or Lucas.

Well, it doesn't raise Penn

You keep on running away from it by saying

20

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, it's not --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It does not deprive the

22

land of all value.

23

Central is totally out of the case.

24
25

The land still has some value.

MR. WOLFSON:

Penn

Well -- I mean -- it's not --

it's not a Nollan or Dolan claim is my point,
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Justice Kennedy.
And it's not a Nollan or Dolan claim because

3

it's not a -- the -- the -- as -- as my friend

4

acknowledged, the question in Nollan and Dolan -- or the

5

rationale of Nollan and Dolan is would the condition, by

6

itself, if demanded unilaterally and outside the

7

permitting context, would -- would that have been a

8

taking of property for which just compensation would

9

have been required?

10

So the --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure it would have

12

been -- sure it would have been, if they just went

13

along -- to a landowner, and the landowner is there,

14

minding his own business, and they say, well, you own

15

some property, so give us a 1 million dollars to build a

16

football stadium.

17

That would be -- that would be

18

unconstitutional, right?

19

MR. WOLFSON:

I think -- I think that

20

would -- I mean, I think that would violate -- could

21

well violate the Due Process Clause.

22

see what the -- you know, what the rationality of it is.

23

It's hard to

But I don't think that this Court has

24

ever -- has ever extended the concept of a taking to

25

requirements that a landowner -- that anybody -- or a
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

landowner, either pay money or, more importantly,

2

because I think what really is this case, is come into

3

compliance with a regulatory requirement that would

4

have -- that -- which he would have to expend money to

5

comply with.

6

And that --

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm trying to understand

8

what would be -- what would be left of Nollan and Dolan,

9

if we agree with you.
Let me give you three situations.

10

First,

11

the petition -- the district says, we are granting your

12

permit on the condition that you give us one-third of

13

your land.

That's Nollan and Dolan, right?

14

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Situation number 2,

16

permit is denied, but it will be granted, if you give us

17

one-third of your land.

18

MR. WOLFSON:

What about that?
I think, in that situation --

19

in other words, if the situation is really exactly the

20

same like Nollan and Dolan, but the permit is denied,

21

but it's clear that it is a concrete -- concrete

22

condition, the landowner can go up through the judicial

23

review process and say, this is -- you know, the denial

24

of the permit application is predicated on an

25

unconstitutional condition, and you should set that
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

aside. 


2
3

first example, for purposes of Nollan and Dolan? 


4
5

Is that the same as the 


JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. WOLFSON:

Almost.

Almost, 


Justice Alito.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Now let me to get to

7

my third.

8

if you give us the fair market value of the third of the

9

land, and, once you have done that, then we're going to

10

condemn your land and pay you the fair market value for

11

it.

12

The permit is denied, but it will be granted,

MR. WOLFSON:

Justice Alito, I think that

13

this Court's decision -- there are -- this Court's

14

decision in Village of Norwood, essentially says, if

15

what is going on is just a pure contrivance to avoid the

16

requirement of compensation in the Just Compensation

17

Clause, that the Court has said, no, it will look

18

through and -- to the substance of the demand and

19

determine that there was -- you know, essentially, an

20

evasion of the just compensation requirement.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As I understand your

22

position, cash is magical, right?

The -- the government

23

can come in and -- come into my house, take all of the

24

cash that's there, and that is not the basis for a takings

25

claim, right?

Because cash is not -- is not a taking.
34

2

MR. WOLFSON:

5

something that costs money, which is -- is different

from cash.

extensive overlay of State law in this area that

20

protects landowners from arbitrary, irrational,

21

22

And I also want to add, there is an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One of the

23

things the -- the Federal provision, the Takings Clause,

24

is designed to prevent property owners from having to

25

bear the costs that should be borne by the people as a
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whole. 


2

The football stadium example, there is no 


3

reason that a particular landowner should have to pay 


4

for the football stadium, simply because he owns 


5

property.

6

The Takings Clause is designed to make sure

7

that those exactions are not imposed on property owners,

8

but spread more evenly across the citizens who benefit

9

from it.

And I guess I don't understand why you say

10

that the Takings Clause is the one provision that

11

doesn't apply in that type of situation.

12

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the

13

Armstrong policy of the -- that the government -- that

14

an individual person should not be forced to bear what

15

society should -- what should be spread to society as a

16

whole -- is not violated when the government insists

17

that a landowner comply with a generally applicable

18

regulation.

19

Now, of course -- of course --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The generally

21

applicable regulation in the football stadium

hypothetical is not generally applicable.

are the owner of this property, and if you want to

24

develop it, you've got to build a football stadium.

In those two situations, what we said in

the analysis that you are talking about.
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, Justice Scalia, there

the claim for the taking is -- for the compensation is

based on Nollan and Dolan, it seems that there is a

mismatch and that what the Petitioner is trying to do is

If there is no -- if there's

seek compensation, but your compensation is for the

justify its regulation.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Wolfson, why isn't it

17

entirely reasonable to say, if you are going to put a

18

condition on a permit, that condition has to have some

19

rough proportionate relationship to the harm that is

20

being done to the permit -- what -- that seems to me

21

perfectly sensible, that if they are going -- if they

22

are going to exact a condition, the condition has to

23

have some discrete proportional relationship to the

24

harm?

MR. WOLFSON:

Justice Ginsburg, I think that

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to emphasize, at the outset,

that Petitioner's argument that Nollan and Dolan should

apply in this context would -- would constitute a

20

radical change in the -- in the way standard generally

21

applicable regulatory programs are operated.

22

It is standard procedure, when someone

permit applicant's burden to establish that he complies

25

with the regulatory program.

easement that was taken?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is what -- if -- if the

10

permit had issued and the -- and an easement was

11

granted, yes, it was the easement.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but it -- wasn't what

13

was taken unreasonably the ability of this homeowner to

14

make the alterations to his house that he wanted to

15

make?

16

and the State said, you can't do it.

17
18
19

He wanted to add another story and the court --

And its only basis for saying, you can't do
it was because you wouldn't give us the easement.
MR. KNEEDLER:

The -- the basis of the --

20

the theory of Nollan and Dolan -- and the Court made

21

this clear in -- in Lingle -- and in Del Monte Dunes,

22

for that matter -- is those two cases apply in a

23

specific situation where there is an exaction of a right

24

of access, an easement for the public to enter the land

25

as a condition.
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And the -- the reason for that, the Court

2

explained in Lingle -- there are really two reinforcing

3

points.

4

access, which is a permanent physical occupation, which

5

is one of -- one of the exceptions to the general Penn

6

Central test for regulatory takings.

7

The first was that there would be public

The other is that it was a per se taking.

8

The -- it -- it was per se that the government could not

9

have acquired that easement for paying -- without paying

10

compensation; therefore, the government could not attach

11

as a condition to the granting of a permit that the

12

person convey something, unless it was proportional.

13

So the -- the theory began with the idea

14

that the easement itself would have been -- the taking

15

of that would have been a per se taking.

16

different situation because the other way in which

17

Petitioner's theory would constitute a radical departure

18

is that compliance with regulatory programs frequently,

19

maybe almost always, requires the expenditure of money.

20

This is a very

scrubber to protect the air, to prevent no -- diminution

12

there would be a very substantial equal protection challenge

13

because one landowner is being singled out with no

rational basis --

50

Alderson Reporting Company

There was a

10

second holding, however, which really gets ellipsed by

11

the second, which is a denial of a permit doesn't permit

12

you to raise the Nollan/Dolan case.

13

me, even if there is an easement situation -- so, even

14

if there is an actual takings claim at issue, do you

15

agree with that first holding by the court below?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it appears, to

We -- we think -Assuming we narrow it

18

not to undifferentiated money, but is there a difference

19

between a denial or a grant?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

If the -- if the agency

21

decision is written where there is an express condition,

22

we don't think that it matters -- an express condition

23

satisfying Nollan and Dolan; in other words, an

24

exaction, a per se taking, we don't think it matters

25

whether the -- whether it's a permit grant or permit
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

denial.
There was no actual taking in the sense that

3

compensation would be owed, but it could be challenged

4

as an unconstitutional condition under the Nollan and

5

Dolan analysis.

6

But we think it's critical, when thinking

7

about that, that the -- that the permit denial -- that

8

only applies if the permit denial expressly is based on

9

the condition because, otherwise, you would get into a

10

situation of negotiations and what was discussed and --

11

and liability could turn on an exchange of ideas;

12

whereas it should turn on the formality of the agency's

13

final decision.

14
15
16

It's akin to the Williamson County final
decision requirements.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you agree -- your

17

friend on the other side cited a number of places in the

18

record, where he thought your condition was satisfied,

19

that the denial of the permit was expressly based on the

20

failure to comply with the offered conditions.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, if you look at the --

22

the orders denying the permit applications in the record

23

at -- I believe it's 49 to 51 and 59 to 61.

24

situations, it says the permits were denied because the

25

plaintiff did not give the reasonable assurances that
52

Alderson Reporting Company

In those

Official

1

the statute requires in order to get the permit -- the

2

reasonable assurances of -- of no loss of wetlands

3

functions.

4

One of the ways --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't this unreal?

I mean,

6

you are saying, all along, in the negotiations, the

7

agency says, if you do X, you get the permit.

8

is -- would -- would be an unconstitutional condition.

9

Okay.

He refuses to do X.

And X

The permit is

10

denied with a general statement like this:

11

is denied because he has refused to do the -- the

12

necessary mitigation.

13

The permit

Isn't it clear that the reason he's refused

14

to do the necessary mitigation, is he has refused the

15

last demand of the agency?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

But the ultimate standard

17

under the statute is whether he has provided reasonable

18

assurances.

19

about it, whether offsite or onsite -- the offsite part

20

just arises because this is a wetlands case.

21

What assurances -- the way in which he goes

Normal regulation wouldn't raise the

22

offsite -- onsite problem.

23

he didn't carry his burden of establishing no net loss

24

of wetlands.

25

But the ultimate question is

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what he's going to

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say, in part, is -- I guess, I did a little numbers from

2

your brief, the 37 million acres in Florida, say about

3

4 million are bodies of water and say a third of them

4

are built up, and we have 11 million that are wetland

5

and 11 million that aren't.

6

That's crude.

So they're saying why in heaven's name are

7

we supposed to -- everybody wants to build.

And why

8

should the people that happen to live in wetland have to

9

pay for all the other wetland?

That's just coincidence.

10

So he is going to say that that is like the Shriners

11

Hospital.

12

Shriners Hospital.

13

You are going to say, no, it isn't like the

Now, all I'm saying is isn't it at least an
issue, under the Takings Clause, whether it is or isn't?
MR. KNEEDLER:

denials -- just general permit denials, the Court made

22

clear, in Del Monte Dunes, are not covered by Nollan and

23

Dolan.

24
25

The permit -- permit

And the Court made clear, in Nollan, that

the Court could have denied the permit without attaching

the condition.

We think it's important that the agency

2

always have that option.

3

And the third point is --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you may be right, but

5

you are making Nollan and Dolan a trap only for really

6

stupid districts -- you know, if they -- they say the

7

right words and then they are out from under it; isn't

8

that right?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I don't think so

10

because -- because there are situations in which an

11

agency actually wants to get the easement.

12

Court, in Lingle, made clear that -- that the general

13

rule is Penn Central, with only the two exceptions for

14

regulatory takings --

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But this

Well, why should it matter whether

16

the -- whether the permitting authority says expressly

17

in the denial, "It's denied because you didn't do this,"

18

or it just says, "It's denied," but it's perfectly well

19

understood what was needed -- what they were going to

20

demand in order to get it.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Because -- if may I answer,

22

because the agency has to reserve -- has to have the

23

ability to -- to deny the permit because the conditions

24

required by the statute were not met.

25

And Nollan and Dolan deal with formality and

approved with conditions, but the property owner still

18

had to satisfy the conditions in order to receive the

19

permit.

20

As to the question about --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They

What do we do with what

22

Mr. Kneedler says is a ruling in your favor on this

23

question, that all denials are subject to Nollan and

24

Dolan?

25

What do we do with that?
I mean, what's the -- I see an enormous
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

flood gate here and one in which we are sending a signal

2

that, perhaps, States should be more quiet, rather than

3

more engaging.

4

they offer is going to be seen as an -- potentially, as

5

an unconstitutional taking. 


They should just say no because anything

They should just plain say no and not 


6
7

explain why, not engage in any work with you to 


8

mitigate. 


9

MR. BEARD:

Justice Sotomayor, I don't 


10

believe that negotiations will suddenly break down, and

11

we will see a flurry of permit denials, if the Court

12

rules in our favor.

13

true, I should say, they will lose flexibility in

14

demanding whatever it is that they want under the

15

Takings Clause.

16

What will happen, instead -- it's

They won't have any review.

But the benefit

17

of applying our rule that says monetary exaction should

18

be treated like other exactions and be reviewed under

19

Nollan and Dolan --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But they're not.

People

21

are asked to pay taxes.

22

taxes all the time; development fees, if they want to

23

develop something.

24

exactions all of the time in this society.

25

Homeowners are asked to pay

People are subject to money

MR. BEARD:

No question that we all are
57


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

subject, on a daily basis, to government demands that we

2

pay or that we have a financial obligation.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what happens in

4

just -- when the legislature passes a development fee?

5

Are you, now, saying that's subject to Nollan and Dolan,

6

too?

7

MR. BEARD:

If the legislation requires an

8

agency who processes the permit to impose a fee in

9

exchange for a permit -- again, within the land-use

10

context, we are not talking about taxes, homeowners'

11

fees, we are talking within the discretionary land-use

12

process -- that is imposed there, then the risk of

13

coercion, undue influence, and the like arise, and

14

Nollan and Dolan should apply.

15

But I wanted to respond specifically to

16

Justice Breyer's questions about Penn Central.

17

conceptually, there is an important difference between

18

the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine, which is what

19

we seek to apply here, and what would be a permit -- or

20

what would be a Penn Central claim.

21
22

The Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine,
the offense there is the -- may I --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MR. BEARD:

25

I think,

Finish your thought.

The offense there is the

conditioning -- the improper conditioning of a permit.
58

Alderson Reporting Company

1

It's not did the condition force me to lose the value in

2

my land.

3

like Penn Central might answer, subsequent to a permit

4

denial.

5

That's a very different question that a case

The Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine

6

focuses exclusively on the permit exaction and on the

7

conditioning, not on subsequent decisions by the

8

government, for example, to deny the permit.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

10

MR. BEARD:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

The case is now submitted.
