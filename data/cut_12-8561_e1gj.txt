 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

States.

 Mr. Schneider. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY G. SCHNEIDER, 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER, 
 APPOINTED BY THIS COURT 
 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

May it please  Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

12

 This is a case about statutory construction. 

13

Specifically, under 18 USC 2259, must a victim's 

14

victim's losses be proximally caused by a defendant's 

15

offense conduct before a sentencing judge can award 

16

restitution?  The short answer to the question is all 

17

losses must be proximately caused. 

18

 Eleven courts of appeals and the government 

19

agree that this circuit ignored the plain text of the 

20

statute and the enumerated enforcement provisions of 

21

3664 to craft a restitution scheme where the possession 

22

of two images of child pornography resulted in the award 

23

of $3.4 million to Doyle Paroline which was strictly 

24

jointly and severally liable. 

25

 In my time before the Court, I wish to

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

address, first, why the Fifth Circuit decision is 

2

incorrect, and second, why the government's concept of 

3

aggregate causation conflicts with its statutory burden 

4

of proof contained in 3664(e). 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, before  before you 

6

do that, could you explain why there is an issue of 

7

proximate causation here?  Why  why isn't there 

8

clearly proximate cause?  Why is it  why does it 

9

matter? 

10

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

Well, I think there has to 

11

be  in all restitution cases, the issue is whether or 

12

not the person's conduct caused the harm and losses, and 

13

harm and losses are two different things. 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes.  But why  why isn't 

15

the issue here a question of factual causation?  What 

16

losses proximately caused  is proximately caused by 

17

the possession of child pornography? 

18

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

That's a factintensive 

19

question, and that's what the district court has to 

20

determine, whether on the facts presented, there are 

21

identifiable losses that were caused by the defendant's 

22

conduct, and there can be. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It seems you're 

24

confusing proximate cause with cause in fact.  They are 

25

two legal requirements, but not the same.  Proximate

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

cause is foreseeability. 
 There's no argument, I think, that anyone 

3

who possesses child pornography knows that the 

4

individual depicted is going to feel invaded by that 

5

viewing, so there's no issue that the person is hurt. 

6

 The question is a different one, which is 

7

the cause in fact.  I think that's what my colleague Sam 

8

Alito was talking about.  So why do you continue to talk 

9

about proximate cause when it's a different concept 

10

that's at issue? 

11

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well 
Is her treatment  I 

13

think you're arguing that her treatment has to be a 

14

"butfor" this possession. 

15

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

I think they go handinhand 

16

because when dealing with proximate cause, would the 

17

conduct  is the losses the natural sequence from the 

18

conduct and the result?  And what we're dealing with is 

19

would the losses have occurred, but for the conduct. 

20

 And in this situation  in this case, where 

21

the damage model was created six months before the 

22

notice is received, then you don't have the relationship 

23

between the loss and the conduct or the notice of the 

24

conduct.  And it's a real problem. 

25

 But the  the important consideration in

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretation of the statute is the government's burden 

2

of proof under 3664(e). 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why do we  why would we 
Would you agree  would 

you agree that the 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Justice Kennedy. 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:  the losses here were the 

8

proximate result at least of the aggregate actions of 

9

all the offenders?  Would you go that far? 

10
11
12

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

Justice Kennedy, the problem 

with aggregate causation does not apply 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would  would you agree 

13

that it is the proximate result of the aggregate actions 

14

of all the offenders? 

15
16
17
18
19

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

It would be a harm, but 

not 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Pardon me.  A proximate 

harm, right? 
 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

But the problem is when 

20

you're dealing with aggregate causation, that conflicts 

21

with the statutory burden of proof that the government 

22

has, under 3664(e), which is made applicable to the 

23

2059, under Section (b)(2), and you'll find 3664(e) at 

24

Appendix 22 to our merits brief. 

25

 The 

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why  why should we get 

2

to that question, when we have what seems to be a clear 

3

order from Congress, and it is in 2259(a).  It says, 

4

"The court shall  shall order restitution for any 

5

offense under this chapter." 

6

 It sounds like that's a direction that, if 

7

there's an offense under this chapter  which is 

8

undisputed, there is  the court shall order 

9

restitution. 

10

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

Only if  if the losses are 

11

the result of the offense because the government's 

12

burden of proof is that they must demonstrate, by a 

13

preponderance of the evidence, that the losses sustained 

14

by the victim are the result of the offense. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, it doesn't 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

My question is  my 

17

question is why isn't it  and you were going to point 

18

to the statute  why isn't it at least the result of 

19

the aggregate number  aggregate offenders? 

20
21
22
23
24
25

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

It's on the indictment. 

Only one person is charged and 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But he is  he is one of 

the offenders in the aggregate. 
 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

He's not  it's not in the 

indictment.  No one else is in  is in front of the

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sentencing judge.  The statute 3664(e) and Section 

2

(f)  (b)(3)(F), all talk about "the offense," and "the 

3

offense" is normally  this Court has recognized that, 

4

when you talk about "the offense," it's the offense of 

5

conviction. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Schneider, on your view, 

7

if only one person viewed the pornography, that person 

8

would be responsible for the entire damages, but if a 

9

thousand people viewed the pornography and the harm was 

10

that much greater, nobody would be in  would be on the 

11

hook for restitution. 

12

 How could that possibly make sense? 

13

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

Justice Kagan, that's not 

14

what  there are numerous cases where someone who looks 

15

at  possesses child pornography has been shown to be 

16

liable for losses and restitution and some individual 

17

cases that it's not.  And it's fewer cases than not are, 

18

again, no restitution because there's no losses.  The 

19

losses in  it all depends on the facts. 

20

 In this case, the district judge carefully 

21

weighed the evidence.  In this case, like un  unlike any other 

22

case, there are competing experts that the judge, 

23

district judge, played  acted as a gatekeeper of the 

24

forensic science and with the challenge to the 

25

methodology that was presented by Amy's experts, the

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

judge left no alternative because there was no 

2

explanation. 

3
4
5

 And that methodology  faulty methodology 
was part of his decision that he recognized. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, what's the answer, 

6

though, to the problem, forgetting this case?  There's a 

7

problem in child pornography cases.  Congress clearly 

8

wants restitution.  Makes sense to me. 

9

 But if a thousand people look at it, then 

10

each one can say, but I didn't cause more than a tiny 

11

fraction at most, and so there virtually is no 

12

restitution; right?  Now, every one of the thousand says 

13

that, truthfully, and so therefore the victim gets no 

14

restitution  opposite of what Congress wanted. 

15

 But their answer in the lower court was, 

16

we'll make each one of those thousand liable for the 

17

whole thing.  The government's answer is aggregate 

18

cause.  It's called a concept that they've sort of 

19

created, but it's there to answer the problem. 

20

 What's your answer to the problem? 

21

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

22

It's a  it's a very 

difficult question. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 (Laughter.) 

25

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

Yeah, it is. 

And  and the answer is

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to  is multifaceted because the government's burden of 

2

proof for restitution applies to all restitution 

3

statutes.  It's the same standard. 

4

 And you can't carve out one standard of 

5

causation for one crime because it's a heinous crime 

6

and, as repugnant as child pornography is, the standard 

7

of causation has to be the same 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  All right.  I 

suppose that it does.  If you have the same problem, you 

10

have the same problem.  Where there  you understand. 

11

So how  how do we answer this problem?  And the 

12

difficulty of saying  dividing  the government 

13

doesn't find a thousand  you know, it only finds two 

14

or three.  And so you're going to be 997 who escape. 

15

 And those three, what should they pay? 

16

What  should they pay nothing?  Should they pay the 

17

whole thing?  Should we do it somewhere inbetween? 

18

How  just restating the problem and  and you have 

19

experience in this field. 

20

 So what do you really think? 

21

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

Well, in some of the cases, 

22

there's evidence that  of not  of the victim having 

23

knowledge of an individual, and in that case  those 

24

cases, there have been awards of restitution, some of 

25

them 3,000, 5,000, 15,000, 30,000.  But there's some

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

knowledge and there's some evidence for a judge to base 

2

a finding of causation to the award of restitution. 

3

 And it's a factbased determination. 

There 

4

has to be some evidence for which the judge makes his 

5

determination. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But your answer is in a 

7

large category of cases, and this may be  these may be 

8

the typical cases, where there's a digital image, and 

9

it's out there, and you don't even know that there are a 

10

thousand people who've seen it.  It's impossible to tell 

11

how many people have seen it and certainly impossible to 

12

see how many people will see it in the future.  It  it 

13

exists, and it apparently is impossible to eradicate it. 

14

 Your answer is that, in those cases, the 

15

victim gets nothing.  I mean, that's your honest answer. 

16

And that may be where the statute points, but I think 

17

that's your answer to Justice Breyer's question.  The 

18

victim gets nothing in those cases because it's 

19

impossible to determine what percentage of the harm is 

20

attributable to this one defendant's possession of the 

21

child pornography. 

22

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

I don't  and that's not 

23

what I'm saying.  In the Second Circuit, in Lundquist, 

24

was an Amy case where there was a finding of losses and 

25

restitution.  And the court  the Second Circuit

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

specifically addressed how to calculate it.  It doesn't 

2

have to be precise. 

3

 We're not saying it has to be a precise 

4

determination, but there has to be some evidence for 

5

which a judge can base a determination that ties the 

6

losses in this case to the conduct.  Now 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what exactly  give 

8

me an example of what you're talking about.  Now, here, 

9

you're saying because she didn't know the name of your 

10

defendant, you win because you can't say any harm was 

11

caused by him because she didn't know his name, correct? 

12

Is that your position? 

13

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

No, Your Honor.  My position 

14

is that the district judge made a determination as the 

15

gatekeeper of the forensic science that the government 

16

didn't prove its case. 

17

 If you look 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So give me an example of 

19

how the government in the hypothetical that Justice 

20

Alito spoke about and Justice Kagan, you've got  or 

21

or Justice Breyer. 

22

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

Lundquist is a perfect 

23

example, where there are two reports by their expert 

24

explaining how the knowledge of  of an individual of 

25

Lundquist affected her treatment, affected her

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

daytoday life, and their specific report talks about 

2

knowledge of the  this individual. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The particular individual? 

4

She has to know each individual who  who has been 

5

viewing her rape on  on these pornographic items that 

6

have been distributed widely?  She has to know each 

7

individual, or she can't be covered? 

8

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

By 
The woman has undergone 

10

serious psychiatric harm because of her knowledge that 

11

there are thousands of people out there viewing her 

12

rape, but you say she can't  why isn't your client at 

13

least responsible for some of that? 

14

 Even without her knowing him, he had two of 

15

her pictures.  He's one of the thousands of people who 

16

viewed  who viewed her rape.  So why can't she recover 

17

some amount from him? 

18

 I mean, the other side says she ought to be 

19

able to recover everything from him.  You say she ought 

20

to be able to recover nothing.  What about something 

21

inbetween?  What  what about figuring out how much 

22

of  of her total psychiatric damage and all the 

23

expenses and whatnot are attributable to this 

24

particular person? 

25

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

Justice Scalia, the answer

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

to your question is  is multifaceted and 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You said that for another 

question. 

4

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

 (Laughter.) 

7

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

I understand. 
Give me one facet. 

And Congress dictated that 

8

all victims who are identified receive notice, and that 

9

notice goes to her lawyer.  And in the later cases  in 

10

the recent cases, she's been notified of every single 

11

one of those notices that are received, and appropriate 

12

counseling has been given in all the later cases. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Let me ask you.  You're 

14

mentioning this case.  There was another case that also 

15

involved and came up at the same time, the Wright case, 

16

and there was a settlement there, and it was for  what 

17

was the amount of money?  The amount of damages in the 

18

Wright case? 

19
20
21

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

I think, in Wright, it was 

$500,000, was the court's order, I believe. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Now, but was there something 

22

in the evidence there that made it proper to award 

23

restitution in the Wright case, but not in this case? 

24

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

No. 
They're the same?

 Mr. Dreeben.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

7
8
9
10

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 As Justice Breyer indicated, there really 

11

are three stark choices before the Court in this case. 

12

Paroline's position is that, because of a proximate 

13

causation requirement, Amy can obtain nothing in 

14

restitution. 

15

 Amy's position is that, because multiple 

16

people have contributed to her single loss, she can 

17

obtain the full restitution for all of her losses from 

18

every criminal defendant. 

19

 The government's position is that there is a 

20

solution that tort law has developed for providing some 

21

restitution for Amy, not the entire restitution that 

22

would be owed on account of her entire loss. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.  Well, now  not 

24

because tort law has developed that, I mean, I frankly 

25

don't agree with what you say modern tort law is

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

supposed to allow, and  and Keeton  you know, 

2

doesn't really establish that that's what the courts now 

3

do. 

4

 But even without agreeing with that, can't I 

5

find that that is the system that this statute intended 

6

to impose?  I mean, we're dealing here with a question 

7

of statutory interpretation.  So the question is not 

8

what does modern tort law allow, but the question is 

9

what, reasonably, could Congress have meant by this 

10
11
12
13

statute? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

I agree with that, Justice 

Scalia. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Because I'm not going to go 

14

along with you on  you know, modern tort law.  I think 

15

that's nonsense.  I don't think it's true. 

16

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Okay.  The  the tort law 

17

issue is not really all that modern.  It dates back to 

18

the Restatement (Second) of Torts in Section 443(a). 

19

 And this Court applied that section in the 

20

Burlington Northern case, which was a CERCLA case, to 

21

hold that apportionment of the damages was required in a 

22

pollution case, where all the pollution had merged into 

23

a single 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But how do you square 

your position with the statutory language?  The

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statutory language requires mandatory restitution order 

2

for the, quote, "full amount of the victim's losses." 

3

It also forbids courts to  to decline to issue an 

4

order, double negative, but it can't  a court can't 

5

refuse to issue an order on the ground that the victim 

6

has been compensated by any other source. 

7

 It seems to me that that language, as crazy 

8

as it seems, to you or  to you, compels joint and 

9

several liability because it's saying any  all losses, 

10

full amount of losses, and you can't offset her 

11

compensation from any other sources. 

12

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Sotomayor, I think 

13

that the key to reading the statutory language is that 

14

the definition of "victim" refers to a victim of the 

15

offense in this case.  So the term "victim" means the 

16

individual harmed as a result of a commission of a crime 

17

under this chapter. 

18

 The government's burden of proof in Section 

19

3664(e) refers to demonstrating the amount of the loss 

20

sustained by a victim as a result of the offense.  So it 

21

refers to the defendant's offense, not to the collective 

22

harm that the 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So why isn't that a 

24

butfor cause?  I mean, if you're going to argue that, 

25

you have to be arguing butfor

 MR. DREEBEN:

4

I don't think so. 
 that their damages 

 MR. DREEBEN: 

I hope that the Court will 

5

read the "as a result of" language to require causation, 

6

but to interpret it in light of the way causation has 

7

been understood in the unique circumstances that you 

8

have here. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you don't deny 

10

butfor.  I haven't understood your submission to be 

11

that there need not be butfor cause here. 

12

 MR. DREEBEN: 

There's collective, aggregate 

13

butfor cause.  And the way that tort law dealt with 

14

this is not to accept Paroline's position that, even if 

15

it  you took me out of the equation, Amy's harm would 

16

be very severe.  Unquestionably true. 

17

 What tort law said is that, if a 

18

multiplicity of actors inflict a single harm and one of 

19

them comes forward with a reason that, if accepted, 

20

would exonerate all of them, then that cannot be a 

21

proper test of causation. 

22

 The proper test is aggregate causation, 

23

where the aggregate group of offenders is the butfor 

24

cause, and each one of the individuals in that set can 

25

be regarded as 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But doesn't 

2

doesn't the individual at least cause some harm without 

3

regard to the harm caused by the others? 

4

 MR. DREEBEN: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
Of course, yes. 

6

Now, why isn't it the case  why can't the  why can't 

7

Amy have an expert that comes in and testifies, as a 

8

result of their experience, that the psychological harm 

9

caused by knowing that those images are available to 

10

others, have been viewed by someone else, will require, 

11

on average, whatever, a certain amount of counseling for 

12

a certain amount of time?  So that the one individual is 

13

responsible for that harm, regardless of what else 

14

happens. 

15

 Now, he may say, well, it's kind of unfair 

16

to stick me with that, but that's a different question 

17

than the aggregate causation issue that you're 

18

addressing. 

19

 If you have expert testimony, and there will 

20

be expert testimony on the other side, that says it 

21

normally requires counseling for someone, when they find 

22

out, without regard to anything else, that an individual 

23

has viewed this, why doesn't that require  or at least 

24

allow assessment of the  the whole amount? 

25

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, that would

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

allow assessment of some of the damages.  I  I don't 

2

think that it would allow assessment of the entire 

3

amount because, again, we regard this  this statute as 

4

enacted against the backdrop of tort law principles that 

5

recognized you can have aggregate causation, but it's 

6

not appropriate to hold each person in the set 

7

responsible for all. 

8
9
10
11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

My  I'm sorry.  My 

hypothetical is not aggregate causation.  It is that 
this individual caused this harm. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

If there's a specific amount 

12

of harm caused and if Amy could find an expert who would 

13

testify to that respect and it would require, say, six 

14

counseling sessions, and it would set her back in 

15

employment for a year, then I guess a court could, if it 

16

found that credible, conclude that a certain amount of 

17

loss is attributable directly 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you're  you're 

19

confusing whether there's a specific amount of harm 

20

caused with whether it is easy to measure that harm. 

21

The  the tort cases you refer to are cases in which 

22

there is a result produced that is not severable.  You 

23

can't say this person is  you know, accounts for this 

24

much of it, such as pollution, all the pollution there. 

25

The stream is polluted.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 That's quite different from this case 

2

where  where this  this young woman has been 

3

subjected to psychological harm because of thousands of 

4

people viewing her rape. 

5

 Now, this  she would be subjected to less 

6

psychological harm if it was just one person or ten 

7

people or a hundred people.  In other words, each person 

8

increases the amount of her psychological harm.  It is 

9

severable the way the tort cases you refer to are not. 

10

 And so why shouldn't the question in this 

11

case be simply he caused a certain incremental amount of 

12

psychological harm to  to this woman and he should pay 

13

for it and it's up to the district court to decide what 

14

the proper amount of that payment ought to be. 

15

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Scalia, I think that 

16

is consistent with the conclusion that the government 

17

reaches, although we take a different route to it 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MR. DREEBEN: 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I understand. 
 than Your Honor's position. 
Well, is it consistent with 

21

human psychology?  Are psychologists really able to do 

22

this?  If it's known that this image has been viewed 

23

by  even if you could figure out how many people have 

24

viewed it, and I think, in the age of the Internet 

25

that's impossible, but if you knew that it had been

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

viewed by a thousand people, is a psychologist able to 

2

say that her knowledge that it has been viewed by a 

3

thousand people causes this much harm? 

4

 And once she learns that it's now been 

5

viewed by a thousand and one people, there's a little 

6

bit of additional harm or some increment of additional 

7

harm, and we can figure out how much that is.  Can a 

8

psychologist do that? 

9

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Alito, that is why the 

10

government has proposed a different approach to getting 

11

to the same conclusion. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Dreeben, I would 

13

really like you to tell us, concretely, what the 

14

government's approach would be; that is, we have all is 

15

one position, nothing is another position, and the 

16

middle.  The government comes down in the middle, and 

17

what I gather from your brief, you say there should be a 

18

reasonable formula to arrive at a starting point for 

19

further analysis. 

20

 So I don't know what you propose as a 

21

starting point.  What is the reasonable formula that the 

22

Court should use for its starting point? 

23

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Ginsburg, the courts 

24

have approved several different formulas as not being an 

25

abuse of discretion.  One camp of courts approves a view

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in which the government submits the number of people who 

2

have been ordered to pay restitution to Amy, and that 

3

number is then divided into the total harm, measured by 

4

monetary means, that Amy has established.  And that 

5

provides a starting point. 

6

 So, for example, in this case, that starting 

7

point would be around $18,000, and then courts can 

8

adjust that. 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How do you get to the 

18,000? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

By considering the number of 

12

defendants who have been ordered to pay restitution to 

13

Amy because that provides some certainty in the face of, 

14

as Justice Alito pointed out, the great difficulty in 

15

determining how many people have actually viewed these 

16

pictures 

17
18
19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

How does that  I'm 

sorry. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

 the number of people who 

20

have been ordered to pay to restitution represents a 

21

judicial finding that, in fact, her picture is involved 

22

in that person's offense. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

And so it wouldn't 

for  go ahead.

23

Alderson Reporting Company

How does that work 

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It wouldn't include the 

2

people who are not prosecuted, and it wouldn't include 

3

the people who, in the future, are prosecuted. 

4

 MR. DREEBEN: 

That is correct.  And some 

5

courts, Justice Ginsburg, have, therefore, required that 

6

the formula be adjusted to make some sort of reasonable 

7

estimate of the total pool of violators.  And so I 

8
9
10
11
12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

just one moment.  How does that work for the first 
person? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

It doesn't work very well for 

the first person, Mr. Chief Justice. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

14

 (Laughter.) 

15

 MR. DREEBEN: 

16
17

Can I ask you one 

All right. 

And for that reason, I think 

there are other approaches that do work. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can we with ease say, look, 

18

it's very complicated.  I can think of some answers, but 

19

they're too complicated for me to tell you what they 

20

are.  And Justice Scalia has a possible answer.  Justice 

21

Alito, it seemed to me, is pointing out that the second 

22

person to look at the thing, if they're only two, 

23

probably adds a lot of damage, but the 1000th person 

24

compared to 999 is near zero. 

25

 Now, do we count this defendant as Number 2

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or do we count him as Number 1000?  Very hard to answer, 

2

no answer, really.  But can we say, we can't answer how 

3

you do this in practice.  Leave it to the sentencing 

4

commission.  That's their job. 

5

 Now, can we say that? 

6

 MR. DREEBEN: 

7

The Court can certainly say 

that the statute requires reasonable apportionment 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes. 
 and the districts courts 

10

have jurisdiction to experiment with different 

11

formulations. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But can we say  can we 

13

suggest that the sentencing commission  you can't 

14

order them to do it, of course not. 

15

 But can we suggest that this is the kind of 

16

problem, very difficult, technically several ways to do 

17

it, that they can go into this.  Is that true, that they 

18

could go into it and recommend or perhaps order? 

19

 MR. DREEBEN: 

They could recommend a  an 

20

approach.  What the sentencing commission actually did 

21

was recommend to Congress that it fix it because the 

22

disagreements now pertain to the understanding of the 

23

statute. 

24
25

 Our submission is that there are a variety 
of ways to approach this problem.  None is perfect.

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, could you say more 

2

about that?  You said that the Chief Justice's question 

3

was right, that it doesn't work for the first person, 

4

and you said there are better ones.  What are the better 

5

ones? 

6

 MR. DREEBEN: 

The alternative that I would 

7

propose in that instance is to look at other similarly 

8

situated child pornography victims and take a look at 

9

what district courts have been awarding to those victims 

10

in similar types of cases and provide some sort of an 

11

average range. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But  you know  I mean, 

13

it struck me, when I read your brief, that it said, I 

14

don't know why these courts started where they started, 

15

whether each violation is worth 1,000 or 5,000 or 

16

50,000. 

17

 And it seems as though somebody just plucks 

18

an initial number out of the air and then everything is 

19

pegged to that initial number, but that the initial 

20

number has nothing in particular behind it or am I  is 

21

it more sensible than that? 

22

 MR. DREEBEN: 

I hope that it's not quite as 

23

arbitrary as plucking it out of the air, but the reality 

24

is 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But they're certainly

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not using your theory.  Even though it's not plucked out 

2

of the air, they're certainly not using your theory. 

3
4
5
6

 MR. DREEBEN: 
impossible to 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 MR. DREEBEN: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10

Yes.  So they're using some 

theory. 

7

9

On the first one, it's 

They are using some theory. 
And you have no idea what 

that is and can't suggest one, right? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

I think that, sometimes, they 

11

articulate various considerations, and other times, they 

12

rely on basically a consensus  a judicial consensus 

13

that in a world in which perfect information and 

14

mathematical computations are not going to happen, a 

15

reasonable approximation that accords with the judgments 

16

of 200 other Federal judges is a sensible way to do 

17

this. 

18

 And I 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

20
21
22
23

But that makes no 

I mean, how do you tell the difference 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not sure what 

sensible 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

How do you tell 

24

your model, how does it work if it turns out that the 

25

damages are a million dollars, as opposed to $3.4

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

million?  Is it still $1,200 per offender? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

We would, as I indicated, 

3

start with a  a division problem and approximate 

4

the  the number of damages that are allocable to that 

5

individual and then adjust it because these defendants 

6

are not all identical. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

So you start with 
So you would 

expect  you would expect the defendant in a case where 

10

the restitution sought is a million dollars to pay 50 

11

percent of what he would pay if the damages were $2 

12

million. 

13

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Not necessarily because, as I 

14

indicated, Mr. Chief Justice, the defendants aren't all 

15

identical.  Mr. Paroline possessed two images.  Some 

16

defendants may possess a hundred images.  Some 

17

defendants may be distributors, as well as possessors, 

18

and courts have taken those factors into account. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What about taking into 

20

account that the perpetrator, the uncle, that the 

21

restitution was something like $6,000; right? 

22
23
24
25

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes, that's correct, Justice 

Ginsburg. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So if there's any kind of 

proportionality, it seems that the possessor of two

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

images should not be responsible for more than the 

2

person who perpetrated  perpetrated this horrendous 

3

crime. 

4

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, his  his restitution 

5

may have been predicated on a very early period, where 

6

it was not clear that Amy would be as victimized as she 

7

has turned out to be.  The very vice of child 

8

pornography possession and distribution is that it 

9

continually reinflicts the abuse on the victim, so that 

10

she cannot make a fresh start and say it's finally over, 

11

I've put this behind me, I can now move on with my life. 

12

 The continuing revictimization of her is 

13

what justifies and creates the increased harms. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I would like you to, to 

15

the extent that you can, to help district judges get a 

16

handle on this, what formula should they use and what 

17

adjusting factors should they take into account after 

18

they have that starting formula? 

19

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Ginsburg, the  the 

20

formula that I proposed is the one that the government 

21

has been suggesting to district courts around the 

22

country. 

23

 Look at the number of convicted defendants 

24

who have been ordered to pay restitution to Amy, divide 

25

that into the total harm that the district court finds

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was the result of the community of child pornography 

2

possessors and then adjust it based on the severity of 

3

the offense. 

4

 Courts of appeals have said that other 

5

formulations are also not abuses of the district court's 

6

discretion, and I would emphasize 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And that's wonderful 

8

and  you know, I  I want to go along with you.  This 

9

is a bad guy, and  and he ought to be punished, and he 

10

ought to give restitution, but there is such a thing as 

11

due process of law. 

12

 And what you're saying is  I have no idea 

13

how much he's going to be required to turn over, whether 

14

it's going to be  what was it in this case, $3 

15

million? 

16

 MR. DREEBEN: 

17

that Amy has asked for. 

18

That's the amount of money 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I have no idea what he's 

19

going to be socked with, and that's not what we usually 

20

do with criminal statutes. 

21

 MR. DREEBEN: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, in criminal 
You just can't say leave it 

23

up to the district judge  you know, and they all come 

24

out different ways, but who cares, it's  you know, so 

25

long as it's within some 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DREEBEN: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 MR. DREEBEN: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5
6

Well, Justice Scalia 
 some reasonable amount. 
Post Booker 
That's just not the way we 

do law. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

 post Booker, that is what 

7

happens in criminal sentencing.  District judges have an 

8

enormous amount of discretion about how much 

9

imprisonment time and fine time to use to apply to a 

10

defendant.  And there is appellate review that helps 

11

establish some norms that can look to sentencing 

12

guidelines as starting points. 

13

 But in criminal sentencing, imprecision and 

14

estimation is the order of the day.  And when you're 

15

dealing with 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's because the statute 

17

says so.  It says you get from  you know, 10 to 20 

18

years, okay?  But the statute here doesn't say  you 

19

know, you'll  you'll get between this and this, 

20

whatever the district judge likes.  It doesn't say that. 

21

It says you  you should compensate the victim for 

22

what  for what you've caused her. 

23

 MR. DREEBEN: 

But there are two background 

24

principles that I think reinforce that a reasonable 

25

estimation is better than all or none.  The first

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

background principle is that, in criminal restitution, 

2

exactitude is not required.  Reasonable estimates are 

3

the order of the day.  Courts have recognized that. 

4

 And it's reinforced here by the fact that 

5

this restitution provision is kind of a crime/tort 

6

hybrid.  It's criminal sentencing, but it's enacted 

7

against the background of compensatory tort law.  And in 

8

compensatory tort law, reasonable estimates have long 

9

been accepted. 

10

 In the Burlington Northern case that I 

11

referred to earlier, the district court made an effort 

12

to do some calculations, and then, at the end, he 

13

applied a 50 percent "fudge factor" for estimations that 

14

reflected possible calculation errors. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We have a fudge factor 

16

here?  Can a  can a district judge use what he calls a 

17

fudge factor  this is a criminal statute.  It's not a 

18

tort case. 

19

 MR. DREEBEN: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

It is a criminal provision 
We're going to be liable 

for a fudge factor. 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 MR. DREEBEN: 

 that is  that is placed 

24

into criminal sentencing with a goal of both 

25

compensating victims and determining that each defendant

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

comes face to face with the fact that that person has 

2

inflicted some harm on a particular victim. 

3

 That's a valuable criminal sentencing 

4

purpose, and to the extent that the only thing that 

5

courts can do in this situation is attempt reasonable 

6

approximations, that will not be exact, it's a better 

7

solution than saying nothing, as Paroline would do, or 

8

saying Amy  everything, as Amy would do. 

9

 That is not proportionate to what the 

10

defendant has done, but zero is also grossly 

11

disproportionate to what the defendant has done.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. CASSELL 

16

19

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT AMY UNKNOWN 
 MR. CASSELL: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Remarkably, this morning, the other parties 

20

have taken a statute that promises Amy she will receive 

21

restitution for all of her losses and interpreted it to 

22

be a statute that has fudge factors, imprecision, 

23

estimation, to produce some kind of an award that, in 

24

the government's view, is fair. 

25

 That's not what Congress provided in this

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particular statute.  Congress answered the question 

2

presented.  You were asking, Justice Breyer, what's the 

3

amount?  The text of the statute tells us.  It is the 

4

full amount.  Here, Amy has put forward 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why?  I mean, the person 

6

didn't cause the full amount.  I mean, do you think 

7

Congress didn't intend  do they want to have people 

8

pay for injury they didn't cause? 

9
10
11

 MR. CASSELL: 

We disagree with your premise 

there, with all respect. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, if you think he 

12

caused the full amount, fine.  But, I mean, immediately, 

13

you'll say at least they have four other people that 

14

they prosecuted for this, and those people caused it 

15

just as much, and so let's divide it by five. 

16

 MR. CASSELL: 

The solution to the point that 

17

you're raising, Justice Breyer, is to recognize that 

18

Petitioner was a contributing cause to all of Amy's 

19

losses. 

20

 Amy's losses come from a vast, faceless, 

21

anonymous crowd of thousands of people scattered around 

22

the globe, from Denver to Denmark, who are looking at 

23

pictures of her being raped as an eightyearold girl. 

24

And that aggregate group of people all contribute to a 

25

loss.

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And I'm sure that Your Honor is familiar 

2

with cases from this Court, for example, the Norfolk & 

3

Western case, where asbestos manufacturers all 

4

contributed to a particular loss.  The result in that 

5

case was joint and several liability.  Each person who 

6

contributed to the loss was on the hook for the damages 

7

in their entirety. 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So  so Congress assumed 

that this defendant could be liable, in part, for other 
people's crimes? 
 MR. CASSELL: 

No, Justice Kennedy.  What 

12

Congress assumed is that he would contribute to a single 

13

loss, and then, at that point, he would be 

14

responsible 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

16

 MR. CASSELL: 

A single law or loss? 
I'm sorry.  Loss.  He 

17

contributed to the loss, and it's important to 

18

understand 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

He had two pictures.  He 

20

did not distribute at all.  He was not a distributor, 

21

right? 

22

 MR. CASSELL: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's right. 
He was just convicted of 

24

possessing two pictures.  And  and the statute doesn't 

25

even require intentional possession, just knowing

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

possession, right?  He could have gotten them by 

2

accident.  He knew he got them, but he never took them 

3

off of his computer, but he's still guilty of the crime. 

4

 So I  he's guilty  he's guilty of the 

5

crime.  But to sock him for all of her  all of her 

6

psychiatric costs and everything else because he had two 

7

pictures of her? 

8

 Congress couldn't have intended that. 

9

 MR. CASSELL: 

Congress did intend that, Your 

10

Honor.  They said that he is responsible for the full 

11

amount of the losses. 

12

 There's a twostep process here. 

First, did 

13

this particular defendant caused harm to this particular 

14

victim?  That's the victim definition found in 2259(c). 

15

And there are findings of fact by the district court in 

16

this case that the defendant, Petitioner, did harm 

17

did harm Amy. 

18

 And then, at that point, the only question 

19

left under this mandatory restitution statute is how 

20

much restitution does she get?  And Congress has 

21

answered that question.  She gets the full amount, for 

22

five itemized categories of losses, psychological 

23

counseling being the most prominent. 

24
25

 She's documented, with detailed submissions, 
that she is going to bear 

36

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but 

2

responsible for those as a proximate result of the 

3

offense. 

4

 MR. CASSELL: 

That 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The only offense 

6

shown here in this case is the possession of the two 

7

pictures.  So how  how can all of those amounts be the 

8

result of the possession of two pictures? 

9

 MR. CASSELL: 

The language you have quoted, 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, is from Subsection (F).  Amy is not 

11

seeking any recovery under Subsection (F). 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you understand 

13

the statutory principle, that it says, "any other losses 

14

suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the 

15

offense," which suggests that the prior losses are also 

16

limited as a proximate result of the offense. 

17

 MR. CASSELL: 

No, Mr. Chief Justice, and we 

18

would ask you to affirm the Fifth Circuit's En Banc 

19

decision, which disagreed with that reading.  There are 

20

numerous canons of statutory construction 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Why would Why would it make 

22

sense to say that he's liable for lost income, whether 

23

or not it's a proximate result, but when it comes to 

24

other losses suffered by the victim, they have to be the 

25

proximate result?

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CASSELL: 

There are a number of answers 

2

to that question, Mr. Chief Justice.  "Any other losses" 

3

is potentially openended.  It includes such things as 

4

emotional distress damages that could be potentially 

5

uncapped. 

6

 (A) through (E), however, are all 

7

outofpocket pecuniary costs.  They are defined.  And 

8

in this case, we have defined, with precision, what the 

9

course of lifetime psychological counseling costs will 

10
11

be for Amy. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Does your case fall if 

12

we don't buy your argument, if we read into (F) 

13

proximate causation? 

14

 MR. CASSELL: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, Justice Sotomayor 
So why are you wasting 

16

time on the argument if you win either way?  Tell us 

17

without it. 

18

 MR. CASSELL: 

I think we win either way, and 

19

obviously, I have to anticipate that there may be a 

20

variety of views on this very difficult question.  But 

21

let's assume that the Court wants to read proximate 

22

cause into other parts of the statute where it does not 

23

appear.  At that point, the question simply becomes what 

24

do we mean by proximate cause? 

25

 Proximate cause is a legal shorthand for

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

scope of the risk  a legal duty.  And Congress has 

2

defined the legal duty here.  For those criminals who 

3

commit a serious 10year Federal felony, the scope of 

4

their risk is they will pay the full amount of the 

5

psychological counseling costs 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Can I get back to 

7

your point was that all of the (A) through (E) is 

8

limited, and you don't need  well, it's not.  One of 

9

the losses that can be gained  recovered is lost 

10
11

income. 
 Now, if you take away proximate cause, the 

12

argument can be, well, I had to undergo counseling in a 

13

particular period, so I wasn't able to get a master's 

14

degree in this.  Because I didn't get a master's degree, 

15

I wasn't able to get a betterpaying job, and therefore, 

16

I'm entitled to the income from the betterpaying job 

17

that I would have gotten if I had a master's degree, if 

18

I didn't have to take the counseling. 

19

 Now, unless you limit that by proximate 

20

cause, it's entirely openended.  It's not confined, as 

21

you said. 

22

 MR. CASSELL: 

Well, there  you're talking 

23

about the problem of butfor causation, then what kind 

24

of additional limitation will placed on this. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

No, no.  I'm talking

Official

1
2

about proximate causation. 
 MR. CASSELL: 

Right.  So there would be an 

3

additional cause, which the government argues should be 

4

a proximate cause limitation, but there are other 

5

limitations that could be attached, and that's what the 

6

Fifth Circuit En Banc did.  It said, for example, that 

7

if Amy suffered a car accident on the way to therapy, 

8

that that would not be included. 

9

 Why? 

Because, contextually and 

10

conventionally, we would not refer to those types of 

11

losses as stemming from child pornography.  That's 

12

proximate cause. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Like Justice Sotomayor and 

14

like the government here, I think, even if there is a 

15

proximate cause requirement, it has been  it has been 

16

met, once you adopt the aggregate offense notion.  But I 

17

wanted to ask you about Subsection (F). 

18

 My  it doesn't seem to me that you 

19

whether or not you read the proximate cause element in 

20

(F) into (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), it seems to me 

21

what you have to read into (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) 

22

is the portion of (F) which says, "any other losses 

23

suffered by the victim as a result of the offense."  "Of 

24

the offense." 

25

 Is it only (F) that is limited to the

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particular offense, and (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) 

2

means those  those items that come from anybody else's 

3

conviction? 

4

 MR. CASSELL: 

No.  The linkage  the 

5

particular defendant's conviction comes from Subsection 

6

(C).  A victim such as Amy has to establish that she's 

7

been harmed as a result of this defendant's crime.  That 

8

establishes  there's been a reference to aggregate 

9

cause.  We think the way to look at this would be 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And is that another way of 

saying as a result of this defendant's offense? 
 MR. CASSELL: 

As a result of this 

13

defendant's offense  we agree that Subsection (C) 

14

requires Amy to show that she was victimized by this 

15

defendant. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But you  you are not 

17

claiming, are you  or are you?  that she's been 

18

victimized to the tune of 3.4 million, as a result of 

19

this particular defendant's offense? 

20

 MR. CASSELL: 

We are saying that she  that 

21

the Petitioner in this case, the defendant, contributed 

22

to all of the losses that she suffered. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

24

 MR. CASSELL: 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, contributed to. 
Yes. 
But I take it that the point

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the government's submission is only contributed to, 

2

and now, we have to sort of approximate what the 

3

contribution was.  And you come in and you say, no, it 

4

shouldn't be  notwithstanding that this particular 

5

offense was responsible for only a part, you think the 

6

defendant should be liable for the whole. 

7
8
9

 MR. CASSELL: 

We think that the defendant 

contributed to all her losses. 
 Let me give you a quick illustration. 

Next 

10

week, when Amy goes to her therapist and is billed $100, 

11

the defendant contributed to all $100.  And of course, 

12

all we have when we get to the additional numbers down 

13

the road is simply the fact that she's going to be going 

14

to therapy, not just next week 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I'm just not sure 

16

what that means, contributed to $100.  Does that mean 

17

she's  the defendant is responsible for the entire 

18

$100 

19

 MR. CASSELL: 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
 as a matter of fact?  Or 

21

does it mean that the defendant is responsible as a 

22

matter of fact for some lesser part of the entire harm? 

23

 MR. CASSELL: 

No, the first.  He's 

24

responsible  he is a contributing cause of the entire 

25

amount.

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I  I guess I'm  when I 

2

say responsible, I don't mean as a legal conclusion.  I 

3

mean did the defendant cause the entire $100 of harm? 

4

 MR. CASSELL: 

He contributed to the entire 

5

$100, just as multiple polluters contribute to 

6

asbestosis 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

Well, that's 
So he should contribute to 

the payment.  You're saying he contributed to the harm, 

10

but he makes 100 percent of the payment.  That doesn't 

11

seem to me to make much sense. 

12

 MR. CASSELL: 

Well, Justice Scalia, we're 

13

pure textualists on this.  When you look at the text of 

14

the statute, Congress has answered that question. 

15

Congress could have written the statute different ways, 

16

but they said that she is entitled to recover the full 

17

amount of her loss 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20
21

Well, full amount 
They don't say from that 

person. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 from the particular 

22

offense, Mr. Cassell, so that it's the full amount of 

23

whatever the particular offense caused.  But you're not 

24

saying that this Defendant caused the entire 3.4. 

25

 MR. CASSELL: 

We're saying he contributed to

Alderson Reporting Company

the entire 3.4 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me give you 

this 
 MR. CASSELL: 

 along with the other 

people. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to 

interrupt you. 
 MR. CASSELL: 

No, I  you can't 

disaggregate them, and that's the fundamental problem 

10

here.  If you look at, for example, our amicus brief 

11

with the American professional association involved with 

12

the sexual abuse of children, what they say is that you 

13

cannot tease out this particular defendant or this 

14

particular harm. 

15

 They all come together to 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So  so contributed, also, 

17

a person who didn't have a picture of her, but watched 

18

other victims. 

19

 MR. CASSELL: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, no 
That person contributed to 

21

her, too, because it creates a market for the entire 

22

situation.  So some limiting principle has to come into 

23

play, and the limiting principle that I think people are 

24

driving at is, because there's a terrible crime, we 

25

don't convict the person who didn't do it, all right?

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And similarly, because this is a terrible crime, you 

2

don't require a person to pay what he didn't cause. 

3

 Now, that's sort of a principle going on. 

4

Now, if you accept that, at least hypothetically, can 

5

you give any answer  I'm afraid you can't and you're 

6

going to say 

7

 MR. CASSELL: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

No, I'm 
But answer to what seems to 

be bothering me and a lot of others is, okay, let's 

10

accept the notion of cause, but what is a  this is 

11

called restitution 

12

 MR. CASSELL: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
 it isn't called fines. 

14

And so, given that, what  how do you do it?  How do 

15

you distinguish, so she gets some reasonable amount? 

16

How do you do it that you're  I can think of  we've 

17

had about four different suggestions here.  But what's 

18

your opinion, if you lose on the first?  What's the best 

19

way to do it? 

20
21
22
23
24
25

 That's what I think people are struggling 
for  with. 
 MR. CASSELL: 

The best way to do it is to 

give Amy the full amount of her losses in this case. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's what I suspected you 

would say.

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me give you 

3

Mr. Cassell, let me give you this example.  There are 

4

pictures like this, and it's known that they are out on 

5

the Internet, and so therefore, they are probably always 

6

going to be available and who knows how many people are 

7

going to view it. 

8
9

 And so the first person is caught for 
possession of some of these pictures and is convicted, 

10

and the psychologist testifies that  you know, my 

11

client  that the victim in this case knows that these 

12

things are out there, and there's an unknown  an 

13

unknown quantity of people are going to view it, and my 

14

estimate is that the  the treatment she is going to 

15

need for this is going to be $5 million.  All right.  Or 

16

3 million  $3 million, whatever it is. 

17

 Now, the first person is convicted, so the 

18

first person is assessed restitution in the amount of 

19

$3 million, right?  But then, shortly after that, ten 

20

more people are convicted for possessing the same 

21

amount. 

22

 They all pay nothing because the first 

23

person paid everything?  That's your answer? 

24
25

 MR. CASSELL: 

That's our answer, and that's 

exactly what Congress wanted.  Congress wanted to take

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these vulnerable victims, of child pornography crimes, 

2

Federal sex offense crimes, and domestic violence, and 

3

get them full restitution as quickly and effectively as 

4

possible. 

5

 And then, after that, if there's a need to 

6

send an additional message to a defendant, he can be 

7

fined up to a quarter of a million dollars or sent to 

8

prison for a longer period of time. 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What about at least the 

10

amount of the judgments she has already received?  The 

11

total amount, I think, was 3.4 million that you're 

12

seeking? 

13

 MR. CASSELL: 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

15

 MR. CASSELL: 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

19

And she has, so far, 

collected how much? 

16

18

Yes. 

As of yesterday, 1,752,000. 
Would you at least deduct 

that from the 
 MR. CASSELL: 

Certainly.  Absolutely.  No, 

20

we're not asking for double recovery.  Amy simply wants 

21

to be made whole.  She wants to recover her 

22

psychological counseling costs and her losses. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Usually, when we approve 

24

joint and several liability, we do so against a 

25

background of a functioning system of contribution,

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where one defendant pays the entire thing, but then can 

2

go after 

3

 MR. CASSELL: 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right. 
 other defendants and be 

5

pretty well assured that he gets their share.  Now, 

6

here, there's nothing like that, and the question  I 

7

guess the question is you're asking us to impose that 

8

kind of system without the usual thing that goes along 

9

with it, which is a sharing mechanism. 

10

 MR. CASSELL: 

We disagree with the premise 

11

here.  The background principle for intentional 

12

tortfeasors is they got stuck with the entire liability 

13

jointly and severally.  That was the common law 

14

approach.  Now, if you want to deviate from the common 

15

law approach and read a contribution action into the 

16

statute, we're certainly not opposed to this. 

17

 But the overriding goal of Congress, as it 

18

always is when they deal with criminal, intentional 

19

tortfeasors, is to pay more attention to the victims and 

20

less about some notion of distributing losses among 

21

criminally culpable defendants. 

22

 Congress doesn't give you any indication in 

23

this statute that they were concerned that one 

24

particular defendant might pay more than his, quote, 

25

"fair share," or whatever that means.  And the

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fundamental problem with the government's position is 

2

that, after fourandahalf years of litigation, we 

3

still don't have any indication as to how much Amy is 

4

going to receive in this particular case. 

5

 What the government proposes to do is to 

6

cast district courts adrift, as they have been for the 

7

last four and a half years, to look at a variety of the 

8

factors, including, remarkably, if we read the 

9

government's brief correctly, one of the factors is the 

10
11

need to get the victim full  full recovery. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In my example, suppose that 

12

the first person, who has a restitution order for the 

13

full amount, seems unlikely ever to be able to pay that. 

14

Does that mean that they  you would impose the same 

15

keep imposing the same judgment on everybody else, so 

16

everybody would be hit with $3 million? 

17
18
19

 MR. CASSELL: 

Precisely, until  until the 

victim recovers the full amount. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, what about doing 

20

what you'd say is make the department, you can find out 

21

figures, you could find out from figures what's the 

22

likelihood that X number of people will be caught.  And 

23

say it's 3 out of 1,000. 

24
25

 Then what you do is you divide by three. 
mean, that way, everybody would be treated fairly, and

49

Alderson Reporting Company

I 

Official

1

moreover, the victim would at least have a shot at 

2

getting 

3

 MR. CASSELL: 

But the problem is, in this 

4

particular case, the numbers show that at least 70,000 

5

people have viewed Amy's images. 

6
7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And how many  how many 

are going to get caught and convicted? 

8

 MR. CASSELL: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We have no way of knowing. 
Well, you can find out. 

10

There's no  it's not an impossible question for people 

11

to come in and use the numbers and figure it out.  My 

12

guess would be a very tiny percent. 

13

 MR. CASSELL: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

A tiny percentage 
All right.  Fine.  Then 

15

she's going to get a lot of her  then she's going to 

16

get from each one a pretty good share, only 

17

 MR. CASSELL: 

What you're assuming, though, 

18

is that there's going to be a steady stream of cases, 

19

that criminals aren't going to discover new encryption 

20

techniques to keep their nefarious activities secrets. 

21

 We don't know whether there are going to be 

22

convictions next year or the year following.  And 

23

Congress acted against that understanding and said she 

24

recovers the full amount from the very first person, and 

25

if she gets her compensation, then she's out of the

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

picture. 
 And one of the beauties of our approach is 

3

that we estimate, within 2 to 3 years, if you affirm the 

4

Fifth Circuit, her restitution requests will be done. 

5

If you adopt the government's approach, you could be 

6

looking at literally thousands and thousands of cases 

7

where Amy will have to  will have to be filing 

8

piecemeal restitution requests, collecting as little as 

9

$47 under some of the calculation theories that the 

10

government has proposed, and there's no certainty that 

11

she's ever going to get the psychological counseling 

12

costs that she desperately needs and the lost income. 

13

 Now, certainly, Congress could have drafted 

14

the statute in different ways, but every single word or 

15

every single phrase of this statute at least indicates 

16

to you that Congress had one goal and one goal alone in 

17

mind, that is, that victims get the full amount of 

18

restitution that they desperately need. 

19

 And we're not talking here about reworking 

20

an entire restitution scheme for the broad swath of 

21

Federal crime.  We're talking about three crimes covered 

22

by the Violence Against Women Act, the child pornography 

23

cases, Federal sexual assault cases, and domestic 

24

violence cases. 

25

 And it's hardly a surprise to discover, when

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you look at the Violence Against Women Act, that 

2

Congress created a particularly expansive restitution 

3

regime for the victims of these particular crimes. 

4

 And we would direct your attention, for 

5

example, to the bipartisan amicus brief of a group of 

6

senators who were involved in the drafting of the 

7

Violence Against Women Act, and they indicated that 

8

their overriding goal here was to make sure that these

vulnerable victims

word in the statute leads to that.  But the key words 

24

don't.  The key words are "proximate result of the 

25

offense."

 And it's difficult to argue that the entire 

2

amount is a proximate result of the offense of two 

3

pictures. 

4

 MR. CASSELL: 

Well, what happened was the 

5

Petitioner in this case contributed to the entire 

6

amount. 

7

 And then the way the statute operates is a 

8

very conventional way.  He becomes jointly and severally 

9

liable for the full amount.  That's not some kind of 

10

innovation.  This Court, for example, in the Norfolk & 

11

Western case unanimously said that joint and several 

12

liability is the traditional approach. 

13

 And so what Congress has done here is not 

14

create some newfangled regime.  It has simply taken a 

15

joint and several liability regime that this Court has 

16

routinely applied against negligent tortfeasors and 

17

said, when it comes to criminals who act with scienter, 

18

act knowingly or intentionally and cause harm, that 

19

they're going to have to make sure that the victims are 

20

fully compensated. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the point has already 

22

been made that it isn't a typical joint tortfeasor 

23

situation, where you can seek contribution from people 

24

who equally contributed.  How would

answer. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How would  how would 

the defendant here go about seeking contribution? 
 MR. CASSELL: 

Well, the defendant would 

5

if there was a wealthy defendant, who was unhappy with 

6

the share he'd been ordered to pay, he could simply try 

7

to find other wealthy defendants out there and 

8

interplead them in some kind of a case. 

9

 We admit that's going to lead to litigation 

10

burdens, that Congress wanted those burdens on guilty 

11

criminals, rather than innocent victims.

 Mr. Schneider, five minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY G. SCHNEIDER,

 APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

19

problem.  And Congress, in 1996, apparently codified 

20

codified this Court's opinion in Hughey, in creating a 

21

burden of proof on the government to demonstrate that 

22

the losses sustained by the victim are the result of the 

23

offense and created a number of new mandatory 

24

restitution statutes that apply, and that doesn't 

25

change.

54

1

 So as the reading  the plain reading of 

2

the statute point (59) with the government's burden of proof, 

3

requires that the government demonstrate that, for 

4

example, the medical services losses of the victim of 

5

child pornography are caused by  are the result of the 

6

defendant's offense.  And that's what Congress intended 

7

by adopting  of 3664(e) and placing it as the 

8

enforcement provision of each of the restitution 

9

statutes that it created in 1996.  It codified Hughey. 

10

 And what the idea of contribution suggests 

11

that convicted sex offenders across the country are 

12

going to get together and see who pays what to whom. 

13

That's not what Congress intended.  This is a sentencing 

14

proceeding that requires a particularized, 

15

individualized sentence based upon criminal conduct. 

16

 And that's what  what the  what Congress 

17

intended when it created all these statutes.  The ideal 

18

solution is to say, Congress, make each defendant pay 

19

$1,000 per image.  That would be  into a fund for 

20

restitution for victims. 

21

 And that 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, you're right back to 

23

the question Justice Kagan began, that if you have two 

24

offenders, that there's going to be recovery.  If you 

25

have 1,002, there won't be.

55

 MR. SCHNEIDER: 

There will always be  if 

2

there's two offenders that are caught, you may get 

3

restitution from one of them.  But if  but you're 

4

looking at what a single judge has to sentence someone. 

5

A single judge, like Judge Davis, had one defendant. 

6

 He didn't have a defendant in Florida or 

7

Maine or Oregon to see what that person's background 

8

was, doesn't have the benefit of a PSR.  He has to look 

9

at one person.  And in this case, the district court 

10

balanced two experts and the methodology that was 

11

challenged and simply said, I find she was a victim, I 

12

find that she was harmed. 

13

 But the government didn't meet its statutory 

14

burden of proof in this case, and in many other cases, 

15

there is losses proved.  And there's a difference 

16

between harm and loss. 

17

 In this case, the district court did exactly 

18

what the government wanted them to do:  Weigh the 

19

evidence, listen to the evidence, look at the defendant 

20

and see if the government met its burden.  And we'd ask 

21

the Court to reverse the Fifth Circuit and affirm the 

22

district court. 

23

 Thank you very much.
