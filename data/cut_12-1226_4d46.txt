 (10:05 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument first this morning in Case 121226, Young v. 

5

United Parcel Service. 

6

 Mr. Bagenstos. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL BAGENSTOS 

8
9
10

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

11

 If Peggy Young had sought an accommodation 

12

for a 20pound lifting restriction that resulted from 

13

any number of conditions, whether acquired on or off the 

14

job, the summary judgment record reflects that UPS would 

15

have granted that accommodation.  But because Peggy 

16

Young's 20pound lifting restriction resulted from her 

17

pregnancy and not from one of those conditions, UPS 

18

rejected her request.  That, we submit, is a violation 

19

of the second clause of the PDA which, if it means 

20

anything, must mean that when an employee seeks an 

21

accommodation or benefit due to her pregnancy, that she 

22

is entitled to the same accommodation that her employer 

23

would have given her. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, what you make it 

sound as if the only condition that was not accommodated

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

was a lifting restriction because of pregnancy, and I 

2

I did not understand that to be the case.  I mean, 

3

that's the way you start.  You want  you want me to 

4

say it's only pregnancy, unless I've  I've missed 

5

something. 

6

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, I  so I think on the 

7

summary judgment record here, Your Honor, that the three 

8

very broad classes of  of limitations that UPS 

9

accommodates do  at least there's a genuine issue of 

10

material fact that they cover the waterfront of 

11

everything but pregnancy.  But our position is that 

12

those three broad classes by themselves, even if there 

13

are some conditions out there, that they don't cover 

14

create 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I'm 

confused. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I mean, I think 

18

that's a necessary starting point for your case.  It 

19

seems to me that you started out by really giving a 

20

misimpression. 

21

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, I  Your Honor, I 

22

would submit that that's not right.  I would submit that 

23

in  on this summary judgment record, UPS had  UPS 

24

acknowledges that they provide accommodations to people 

25

with onthejob injuries, but also the summary  but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

also the summary judgment record shows that UPS provides 

2

accommodations to drivers with offthejob injuries that 

3

result in DOT disqualification, and UPS has not been 

4

able to point to a single driver who has a lifting 

5

restriction similar to my client, Peggy Young's, who 

6

didn't get accommodated who was not pregnant.  So  so 

7

I think 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Bagenstos, what would 

your case be if  let's accept, for argument's sake, 

10

that there's a category people who are injured off duty 

11

who do not get light work assignments.  So you  you 

12

pointed to three large categories that do, but let's 

13

suppose one category doesn't. 

14

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Yes.  So in that case, our 

15

position would be, as the plain text of the statute 

16

demands, that the employer would be required to treat 

17

the pregnant plaintiff the same as those classes of 

18

employees who get accommodations 

19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Most favored nations 

treatment. 

21

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So 
It doesn't have to be read 

23

that way.  It  it could be read that way, and it 

24

could  it could also mean that if you give it to 

25

employees generally, you have to give it to pregnant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

employees, although there may be special  special 

2

classes.  I think one of the briefs had an example 

3

about, you know, if  if you have your  your senior 

4

employees driven to work when  when  when they are 

5

unable to drive themselves, you have to do the same for 

6

pregnant women.  Would you say that that's the case? 

7

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

No, we would not say that. 
Why not? 
We would  we would 

10

not say that because our position is that the statutory 

11

text requires that employers provide workers who are 

12

disabled by pregnancy the same treatment they would 

13

receive if they themselves had a similar  had a 

14

condition with a similar effect on the ability to work, 

15

but that had a different source. 

16

 So what the statute prohibits is 

17

discrimination based on the source of the workplace 

18

limitation, not based on seniority, not based on 

19

position within the company. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But suppose you have a 
Justice Breyer. 
Suppose  I mean, we have 

23

a brief, as you've seen it, from the truck drivers, 

24

and  and they say they don't give many of these 

25

benefits to anybody.  And suppose they do, though, give

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

a benefit to a truck driver who has driven over a 

2

particularly difficult mountain pass, you know, where 

3

and gotten himself in some danger.  Now, the  the 

4

the harm or the disability is lifting precisely the 

5

same.  It's just that the source was different.  You 

6

see, this came from taking a  some truck that  doing 

7

something special with it, and, again, it's a kind of 

8

most favored nation problem.  I don't know that source 

9

gets you out of it.  Is  is  what do you say about 

10
11

that? 
 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

So I  I think as to that, 

12

the  the important point is that  that is an example 

13

of what may be an idiosyncratic decision by an employer 

14

to provide an accommodation to a particular employee.  I 

15

think, as Justice Scalia 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I don't know that 

17

it's idiosyncratic, you see, because I don't know all 

18

the workplaces, and I can imagine that employers have 

19

all kinds of different rules for different kinds of 

20

jobs.  And  and is  are you saying as long as there 

21

is one job in respect to which, let's say, they give 

22

them benefits of $1,000 a week when you're hurt on this 

23

job but not on others 

24

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And so 
 then do you have to give

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

them to all pregnant women who hold different jobs? 

2

Now, I think the answer to that must be no, but the 

3

problem for that and for you is how do you distinguish 

4

your situation from that? 

5

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Right.  And I  and I think 

6

actually what Justice Scalia's question to me a minute 

7

ago 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

10

Yes. 
 actually contains the 

seeds of the answer to that. 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

12

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Exactly. 
So  so it seems to me I 

13

might agree that an employer that provides a 

14

particularly good deal to a single nonpregnant employee 

15

doesn't set a 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Not a single.  There's a 

class of people. 
 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

For a small  right.  So 

19

so  but when you have an employer that provides to a 

20

large class, to  to its employees generally, to many 

21

of its employees, this accommodated work treatment 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I see  I see that that 

23

now, it sounds  the other question I have, and it's the 

24

only other one, is it did seem to me there is a way, 

25

given your theory it's a quite easy way for you to win,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

and that would be to bring a disparate impact claim, and 

2

that's what I thought disparate impact claims were 

3

about. 

4

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So 
But you didn't bring the 

6

disparate claim and, therefore, what am I to do because 

7

I don't know that you want to twist the disparate, you 

8

know, intent claim out of shape when you have such a 

9

beautiful vehicle to bring a claim of the kind you just 

10
11

articulated. 
 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, I think the vehicle to 

12

bring the claim of the kind that I articulated is the 

13

second clause of the PDA.  The second clause of the PDA 

14

says that, "Women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or 

15

related conditions shall be treated the same as other 

16

persons not so affected but similar in their ability or 

17

inability to work." 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN : 

Could that take 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You read that as an 

Well, you read that as a 

21

accommodation provision basically, and maybe  maybe it 

22

is.  But let me ask you this question, which goes to 

23

the  the issue of  of whether the types of 

24

accommodations that you would say are required have to 

25

meet some reasonableness standard.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

 Let's say there are two categories of 

2

employees who have lifting restrictions in their job 

3

descriptions.  One consists of people who work alone and 

4

they lift all the time.  A driver who is driving a truck 

5

by herself and has to lift heavy packages all the time 

6

would fall into that category.  The second category 

7

would consist of people who lift more occasionally, and 

8

they do it in a place where there will always be lots of 

9

other employees in the same class available to do the 

10

lifting. 

11

 Now, if an accommodation is provided to the 

12

workers in the second category, would you say that one 

13

must also be provided to workers in the first? 

14

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

15

 So our point is precisely that a driver who 

No, I don't think so. 

16

is pregnant and who has a limitation related to her 

17

pregnancy is entitled to the same accommodation her 

18

employer would have given her if she had sought it for a 

19

different medical condition with the same effect on the 

20

ability to work. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But why  why doesn't that 

22

fit  why doesn't that second class fit within your 

23

reading of the statutory text? 

24
25

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, so because, in our 

in our view, the statutory text, by saying  by drawing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

this distinction between employees affected by 

2

pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions 

3

and not so affected, saying employers can't draw that 

4

distinction, excuse me, and saying instead they look 

5

only at the ability to work, what it does is it 

6

prohibits discrimination based on the source of the 

7

disabling condition.  It doesn't prohibit discrimination 

8

based on different job classifications. 

9

 If you have a driver  if an employer says 

10

no driver who drives alone is going to get an 

11

accommodation whether for an onthejob injury, a DOT 

12

disqualifying injury, or pregnancy, that's fine because 

13

it's the same treatment.  Because, Justice Alito, we do 

14

not read this statute as an independent, reasonable 

15

accommodation 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But why then  I guess I'm 

17

not quite understanding why you can  get the source 

18

classifications into a different category from all other 

19

classifications.  So explain that to me. 

20

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, so, I mean, I think 

21

it  it goes to the statutory text.  So, I mean, the 

22

statutory text says, "Women affected by pregnancy, 

23

childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be 

24

treated the same," et cetera, "as other persons not so 

25

affected but similar in their ability to work."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

 What that  what that text is saying is 

2

to an employer, don't consider whether this person is 

3

affected by pregnancy or not so affected.  That's not 

4

the basis on which you can compare this employee to 

5

other employees.  Instead, compare this employee based 

6

on ability to work. 

7

 And remember, this statutory text was 

8

adopted in response to General Electric v. Gilbert which 

9

upheld an employer policy that distinguished based on 

10

the source of the disabling condition, treated some 

11

kinds of disabling conditions differently from 

12

pregnancyrelated disabling conditions. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I think you're 

14

reading  you have admitted that other persons can't 

15

really be read literally.  Other  you have to read 

16

things into it.  And you would read into it people in 

17

the same job classification.  But if you can do that, 

18

then why can't you also read into it people whose 

19

injuries, whose disabilities have the same source? 

20

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Because once you do that, 

21

then the second clause of the PDA doesn't occupy any 

22

space and then  and Congress should have stopped with 

23

the first clause.  Congress was doing something with the 

24

second clause.  It was trying to overturn the Gilbert 

25

situation, where you had an employer that adopted a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

policy that, as a formal matter, treated pregnant people 

2

the same way it treated nonpregnant people.  If you were 

3

pregnant, but the reason that you weren't able to work 

4

was an offthejob illness or injury, the General 

5

Electric policy in Gilbert would have given you 

6

disability benefits.  And what this Court said in the 

7

Gilbert case was that's not discrimination; it  it 

8

simply doesn't include coverage for pregnancy, but 

9

pregnant women aren't fenced off. 

10

 What this statutory text does is it says: 

11

No, employers have to treat pregnancyrelated conditions 

12

as favorably as they treat nonpregnancyrelated 

13

conditions.  And that's in fact how this Court has read 

14

the statute since it's very first PDA case.  In Newport 

15

News, what this Court said was that the Act makes clear 

16

that it's discriminatory to treat pregnancyrelated 

17

conditions less favorably than other medical conditions. 

18

And here UPS, with the three very large classes of 

19

employees that it provides accommodations to who are not 

20

pregnant, is treating pregnancyrelated conditions less 

21

favorably than other medical conditions. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you do assert it's a 

23

it's a most favored nation provision.  You  you have 

24

to give the benefits that you give to any other class of 

25

employees, right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14

5

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

To any other class of 

employees, I think that's right. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How long  it doesn't 

matter whether that class is enormous or small, right? 
 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, I  so I think this 

6

is  this is text that obviously requires some degree 

7

of interpretation.  I think Your Honor articulated one 

8

way of thinking about it, which is providing it 

9

providing this accommodation or benefit to employees 

10

generally.  And certainly, when an employer provides 

11

accommodations or benefits to such large classes of 

12

employees who are not pregnant, who are similar in the 

13

ability to work 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Does  does the record 

15

show what you have asserted here, that the classes that 

16

are given special treatment is almost everybody? 

17
18

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, I think that we 

have 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Does the record show that? 
I think  I think the 

21

record is sufficient to show that.  Remember, summary 

22

judgment was granted against us. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

25

I understand. 
Yes.  So I think the record 

is sufficient to show that in the following sense:  So,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

number one, obviously, there's all the onthejob 

2

injuries, which  which UPS acknowledges they provide 

3

accommodations for.  Number two, DOTdisqualifying 

4

conditions that UPS provides accommodated work for; we 

5

have presented examples in the record of individuals who 

6

have offthejob injuries, who are similar in their 

7

ability to work as Peggy Young, who have been given 

8

accommodated work, and UPS hasn't pointed to in its 

9

briefing here any driver with a similar lifting 

10

restriction to Peggy Young who was not pregnant who 

11

didn't get the accommodation. 

12
13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 
that argument, perhaps. 

14

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16

You can win your case with 

And I hope so, yes. 
Yes, assume that.  But that 

isn't going to help me, which I'm rather selfish about. 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Because my  my job here 

19

is to write what this statute means for a lot of cases. 

20

And writing the words, what it means is if you give a 

21

lot of benefits to a lot of employees, but not to the 

22

pregnant women and you don't give it to some employees 

23

and not to the pregnant women, and the employer says, 

24

look, pregnant women are like the few we don't give it 

25

to, not to the lot we do give it to, employer, you lose.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

 But by the time I've written that into the 

2

U.S. Code, nobody knows what I'm talking about.  Do you 

3

understand?  I  I need to know how to interpret the 

4

words such that they would do, in your view, what you 

5

want them to do, which is just what I said. 

6

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Yes.  And so  and I think 

7

the important point is if an employer provides 

8

accommodations as a matter of policy to a class of 

9

employees who are not pregnant, who are similar in their 

10

ability or inability to work to the pregnant plaintiff 

11

and does not provide the same accommodation or benefit 

12

to the pregnant plaintiff, it is violating the plain 

13

text of the statute, which says that women affected by 

14

pregnancy 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Most favored nation.  So 

16

you're coming down to most favored nation.  And that 

17

makes sense and that's easy for my colleague to 

18

describe.  He can write that down in his opinion. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But unfortunately, it takes 

20

out of what you just said the fact that you give them to 

21

a lot of employees.  Because you could have a most 

22

favored nation that was two employees 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's right. 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 including those who've 

25

only worked there for 4 years.  A huge seniority.  So 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1
2

so those are the words that I'm 
 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

I understand.  And  and I 

3

understand.  And that's why I think this may be an 

4

easier case than the one 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Basically what you're 

6

saying, if I understand it, is it's okay to 

7

differentiate on the basis of anything but source, which 

8

means whether it's work or nonworkrelated.  That 

9

that's your 

10

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
You're reading out of 

12

the legislative history the fact that Congress 

13

repeatedly said, we're not forcing employers to give 

14

benefits for nonworkrelated injuries, but we're going 

15

to write it so they have to anyway. 

16

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

So I  so I don't think 

17

there's any statement in the legislative history that 

18

says we're not forcing employers to give benefits for 

19

nonworkrelated injuries.  What  there are three 

20

statements in the legislative history that 

21

that Respondent draws a negative inference from. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

I'm so relieved. 
That Respondent draws a 

24

negative inference from to say, obviously, Congress 

25

didn't mean to do that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

 But to return to Justice Scalia's response 

2

there, I mean, the point is the text contains no such 

3

limitation.  And onthejob/offthejob distinctions 

4

were certainly known to Congress at the time it adopted 

5

this  it adopted this statute.  In fact, General 

6

Electric v. Gilbert involved a policy that contained an 

7

onthejob/offthejob distinction, although the flip 

8

side of the one in this case. 

9

 If Congress meant to say that employers have 

10

an exception from the general "shall be treated the 

11

same" requirement for an onthejob/offthejob 

12

distinction, it could have said so.

 If I might reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. 
 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 
 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 
 The point of the Pregnancy Discrimination 

23

Act is to reduce the number of women who are driven from 

24

the workforce or forced to go months without an income 

25

as a result of becoming pregnant.  The second clause of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

the PDA advances that interest in a narrow but important 

2

way.  I say the second clause is narrow because it is 

3

not a freestanding accommodation requirement like the 

4

religious provision of Title VII or like the ADA.  And I 

5

say it is narrow because there's only one thing that an 

6

employer can't do when it affords benefits or 

7

accommodations.  It can't draw distinctions that treat 

8

pregnancyrelated medical conditions worse than other 

9

conditions with comparable effects on ability to work. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That wasn't the position 

11

that the government took in the U.S. Postal Service 

12

policy.  We are told that the government defended a 

13

policy that is, for all intents and purposes, the same 

14

as United Parcel Service.  And more than that, some 

15

briefs called Petitioner's position frivolous, 

16

contrived.  That was the government's position.  So will 

17

you explain how the government  I suppose to this day, 

18

because the Postal Service still retains, as far as we 

19

know, the exclusion of pregnant women. 

20

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Of course, Justice 

21

Ginsburg.  It is correct that the Department of Justice 

22

defended the Postal Service practices against charges 

23

like those that Ms. Young makes in this case.  That's 

24

correct.  We acknowledge that in footnote 2 of our brief 

25

to this Court.

Alderson Reporting Company

 Since then, however, the EEOC has issued 

2

guidance, and that's a very significant fact.  Congress 

3

has charged the EEOC with authority to interpret this 

4

statute and with an authority to enforce it.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I thought we felt that we 

don't give deference to the EEOC. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

You don't give Chevron 

deference to the EEOC. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh. 

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But the government has 

interests 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, come one.  So we give 

13

what  what do you call the other kind of deference?  I 

14

mean, gee, you give that to me even when  even when 

15

I'm in dissent.  I mean, that just means, you know, 

16

treat it for what it's worth. 

17

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

The EEOC sets the 

18

enforcement policy for the Federal sector with respect 

19

to this issue.  That's a significant fact.  We took it 

20

into consideration in deciding what the position of the 

21

United States should be. 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would your position here 

be the same if the 2014 guideline had not been adopted? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

We didn't take that 

position before the 2014 guideline had been adopted,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

Justice Kennedy.  And I just don't know how to answer 

2

that question because we took the position in light of 

3

the guidance it adopted in 2014, which we do consider to 

4

be significant and we do have to weigh our interest as 

5

enforcer of the law as well as employer.  We did so on a 

6

considered basis and we came to the judgment that we 

7

thought was the correct judgment about the meaning of 

8

the statute. 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But we don't give you any 

more deference than we give the EEOC, though, right? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, with respect to 

12

this, I do think that the Court's got to decide what the 

13

best reading of the statute is, that's right. 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What the best reading is, 

regardless of what you think. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

That's correct.  And if I 

17

could turn to that, I think  and I hopefully in doing 

18

so will answer your question, Justice Alito, and also 

19

yours, Justice Kagan.  Here's why we think the statutory 

20

text  and if  maybe it would help if I restated what 

21

I think the rule is and then explain where the textual 

22

basis comes from. 

23

 We think the one thing an employer can't do 

24

as a result of the second clause is draw distinctions 

25

that treat pregnancyrelated medical conditions worse

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

than other conditions with comparable effects on ability 

2

to work.  It's that single thing.  And so seniority, 

3

fulltime work, different job classifications, all of 

4

those things would be permissible distinctions for an 

5

employer to make to differentiate among who gets 

6

benefits. 

7

 Now, as for the textual basis, I'm looking 

8

at the  at the statute here, which is  we've got it 

9

at page 12 and 13 of our brief and it's also in the last 

10

page of the appendix to the petition.  It says that 

11

what it says is that among the class of people who are 

12

comparable in their ability to work," in other words, 

13

similar in their ability or inability to work, as the 

14

statute says, women with a pregnancyrelated medical 

15

condition, in other words, women affected by pregnancy, 

16

childbirth, or related medical condition, as the statute 

17

says, can't be treated worse on the basis of their 

18

condition  that's what we think "treated the same" 

19

means in the statute  than other workers with 

20

nonpregnancyrelated medical conditions that impose 

21

comparable limitations.  Those are other persons not so 

22

affected. 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would you give me your 

24

interpolation again?  You  you altered the phrase and 

25

the words you added were?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

"On the basis of their 

2

condition."  And the reason we think that that's the 

3

sensible and best reading of the statutory text is 

4

because this is focused on the condition and not the 

5

person. 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, but you start 

7

you've got  at the very beginning, you listed three 

8

things that you said were reasonable distinctions. 

9

Because the word I'd like you to focus on is "other 

10

workers" and the problem is which other workers? 

11

Because it is easy to construct hypothetical cases where 

12

the work  the employer treats some other workers the 

13

same as the statute and doesn't others.  And which 

14

distinctions are reasonable and which ones are not, and 

15

how do we tell? 

16

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I'd like to make two 

17

points in response, Justice Breyer.  The first about the 

18

nature of the Title VII claim and the second about the 

19

nature of this kind of an antidiscrimination provision. 

20

 With respect to the first, I think it's 

21

helpful to differentiate between a direct claim of 

22

discrimination, disparate treatment, versus a claim 

23

proven through the McDonnell Douglas framework.  Now, we 

24

think in order to prove a direct claim without going 

25

through the McDonnell Douglas burdenshifting analysis,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

what you've got to show is that an employer offers an 

2

accommodation to a significant class of employees and 

3

that that accommodation fails the test I described 

4

earlier.  It's got to be a significant class. 

5

 Now, we think that's this case. 

We think 

6

that's going to be most cases.  But in the kinds of 

7

examples that Your Honor identified, the one guy driving 

8

across the mountain, for example, I think you'd have two 

9

issues there:  First, when it's one person, you're not 

10

going to be able to make a direct case.  You go through 

11

McDonnell Douglas and the employer may well have an 

12

explanation for that accommodation that would take it 

13

outside the source of the disability limitation and mean 

14

there's no liability. 

15

 And then with respect to that example 

16

there's a second point to be made, I think, which is 

17

that that person who has to drive the particularly 

18

dangerous route, for example, may just well be in a 

19

different job category and, therefore, not similar in 

20

ability or 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I would have thought 

22

it's those types of cases that present the starkest 

23

example of discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, the 

24

idiosyncratic one.  Oh, well, he's doing this, yes, but 

25

he's doing that and then the pregnant woman comes in and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

says, ah, you know, that's not the same thing.  I 

2

thought maybe it's the  the sort of the isolated 

3

examples that would be particularly glaring in their 

4

discriminatory treatment. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, 

6

I guess what I would say about that is that you could 

7

certainly bring a McDonnell Douglas claim against an 

8

individual idiosyncratic difference, but then if the 

9

employer can show that the accommodation was granted to 

10

one not on the basis of a criterion that this sentence 

11

in the PDA would forbid, then the employer's  then 

12

the  then the accommodation is fine, there's no 

13

violation. 

14

 And to get back to the point 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's the  that's  I 

16

used the idiosyncratic example, not because I'm 

17

interested in it, because I think it illustrates 

18

something that isn't idiosyncratic.  And what I use it 

19

to illustrate is the fact that, as here, employers will 

20

have classes of people and the classes may be based on 

21

all kinds of different things.  But this is a case where 

22

there are classes and some get the benefits equivalent 

23

to the pregnancy and some don't. 

24

 And how are we supposed to tell which are 

25

the criteria that are consistent with the statute and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

which are not?  That's what I found as the difficult 

2

question in the case.  And that's why I ask it using the 

3

idiosyncratic, simply to illustrate what I think is the 

4

problem. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes, of course.  Let me 

6

get to the second point I wanted to make in response to 

7

your question, and then I'll try, after I do that, to 

8

give you a very specific response to what you just asked 

9

me. 

10

 The second point is, you know, it is true 

11

that some classes are going to be in and some classes 

12

are going to be out, but that's how discrimination law 

13

operates.  If an employer is discriminating against 

14

women in promotions, the fact that an employer is also 

15

discriminating against overweight men in promotions 

16

doesn't make the discrimination against women any less 

17

actionable because it just reflects the choice Congress 

18

made about whom to protect and whom not to protect.  And 

19

here, the choice Congress made on whom to protect and 

20

whom not to protect is the choice to protect women who 

21

have conditions  pregnancyrelated medical conditions. 

22

That's the congressional judgment here.  They didn't 

23

choose to protect everybody who gets injured off the 

24

job.  They chose to protect those with pregnancyrelated 

25

medical conditions.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose the employer has 

2

the rule, we will, if you have a disability acquired outside 

3

of employment, give you benefits for one month, and it 

4

applies that same policy to the  to the pregnant 

5

woman.  Is that a violation of the statute? 

6

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No.  I think the pregnant 

7

woman would be entitled to the one month, but nothing 

8

more than the  than the Court gives to anybody else. 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

10

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

12
13

But nothing less. 
Correct.  That's correct. 
Why isn't that 

discrimination on the basis of 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, because the statute 

14

requires that people be treated the same, and so she 

15

would be.  The pregnant employee would be treated the 

16

same under those circumstances.  It doesn't require 

17

any 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But not if there is 

19

a separate category of people who are entitled to 

20

benefits for more than one month. 

21

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, the question would 

22

be whether those benefits  whether the distinction 

23

whether the disentitlement of the pregnant employee was 

24

based on the source of her condition, namely, pregnancy. 

25

If it's based on something else like seniority or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28

2

fulltime status, then, of course 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Would you please answer 

3

my question, which was:  Do you mean "source" means on 

4

the job and off the job?  Is that what this case 

5

revolves around?  Because I don't know what "source" 

6

means otherwise. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

9
10

Briefly. 
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, 

briefly. 
 So I think that on the job versus off the 

11

job, that distinction goes to  inevitably goes to the 

12

source of the impairment.  And, of course, pregnancy 

13

will never qualify under that standard.  But this case 

14

is not just about on the job versus off the job.  It's 

15

about on the job versus off the job plus the DOT 

16

certification category, which can include people who 

17

lose their DOT certification and can't drive as a result 

18

of physical conditions other than pregnancy that prevent 

19

them from doing the job they have to do, which could 

20

include lifting.  And the DOT manual, which the 

21

Petitioner cites at pages 6 and 7, says exactly that. 

22

 Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1
2
3
4

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MS. HALLIGAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Justice Breyer, you are exactly correct. 

5

Had Petitioner believed that the policy that UPS 

6

applied, which was to provide accommodations to 

7

employees who are injured on the job but not to provide 

8

accommodations to any employees who sustained a 

9

condition incurred off the job, she could have brought a 

10

disparate impact claim.  We believe she would not have 

11

succeeded, but she could have and she did not.  She 

12

attempted to bring one late in the day.  It was 

13

dismissed by the district court because it had not been 

14

exhausted. 

15
16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Ms. Halligan, could we 

talk about the claim that she did bring? 

17

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
So your reading of the 

19

statute basically makes everything after the semicolon 

20

completely superfluous.  And I think you would agree 

21

with that, wouldn't you? 

22

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

Absolutely not, Your Honor. 

23

The reading that we propose is very straightforward. 

24

What Congress said in the second clause, the key words 

25

are "the same as other persons."  What "other" means is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

simply distinct from whatever is mentioned first.  So 

2

employers have to treat pregnant employees the same as 

3

some distinct group of nonpregnant employees that are 

4

similar in their ability or inability to work and that's 

5

exactly what UPS's policy is. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But that is what the first 

7

provision does.  When it says pregnancy is the same as 

8

sex, when we say because of sex, we also say because of 

9

pregnancy, all of that would be taken care of by that 

10
11

clause. 
 MS. HALLIGAN: 

This Court explained in 

12

Newport News, as well as in CalFed, that the function of 

13

the second clause is to explain how Title VII principles 

14

apply to pregnancy.  And the reason that they had to do 

15

that was in order to repudiate the logic 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So  so you are saying it's 

17

not doing anything new; it's only explaining the old 

18

stuff.  And okay.  Tell me why that's necessary? 

19

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I'm not  I'm not saying 

20

that, Your Honor.  What I'm saying is that in a 

21

pregnancy discrimination case, instead of comparing 

22

women with men as you would in a typical sex 

23

discrimination case, because what the first clause does 

24

is bolt pregnancy on to sex discrimination.  And so if 

25

you compare women and men in a pregnancy discrimination

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

 case where you have a policy that facially discriminates 

2

 against pregnancy, you will nonetheless conclude that 

3

 there's not sex discrimination because there will be 

4

 women who are pregnant in the disfavored group, but 

5

 there will also be women who are not pregnant in the 

6

 favored group, along with men 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I think, again, that that is 

8

 not necessary, because all that the inquiry would be is 

9

 were you discriminated against because you were 

10

 pregnant?  Yes, I was.  No, I wasn't.  You don't need 

11

 any of this other stuff about what the comparator class 

12

 is.  And, in fact, you are creating a kind of double 

13

 redundancy.  It's everything past the semicolon is 

14

 redundant, but then, moreover, the key words here, which 

15

 is "other persons not so affected but similar in their 

16

 ability or inability to work," that becomes redundant 

17

 even within the redundancy. 

18

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I think, to respond to the 

19

 last point first and then to the first.  What 

20

 Petitioner's interpretation and the government's 

21

 interpretation would do would actually be to rewrite 

22

 those words in one of two ways.  Initially, Petitioner 

23

 seemed to be suggesting that if a plaintiff could 

24

 identify any other single employee who was accommodated 

25

 that the pregnant employee would be entitled to the same 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

 accommodation.  What that would mean is the statute

2

 would have to read "the same as any other person."  It 

3

 does not. 

4

 Now Petitioner and the government are both 

5

 suggesting that the only restriction that this bars is a 

6

 restriction based on source.  Any other restriction, 

7

 rank, seniority status, outside legal obligations, are 

8

 acceptable.  But it doesn't contain any of those words 

9

 either, not "source," not 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That seems the  that is 

11

 the question that this language raises, right?  Which is 

12

 why source?  But why not a seniority limitation or 

13

 something like that?  Could I give you an alternative 

14

 way to understand what the statute is doing?  Which is 

15

 that  what we ought to be thinking about is McDonnell 

16

 Douglas.  In other words, this  this provides the 

17

 comparator.  It says an employee can find a class of 

18

 people who are being given an accommodation 

19

 notwithstanding that those people are similarly situated 

20

 with respect to work.  An employee points to that class. 

21

 And then in a typical McDonnell Douglas fashion, the 

22

 employer comes back and says:  No, there is a good 

23

 reason why I'm treating that class differently that has 

24

 nothing to do with pregnancy.  It has something to do 

25

 with I always treat more senior employees differently or 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

 something like that.  And at that point, if the  if

2

 the employer makes his case, the employee gets to come 

3

 back and say, no, that is a pretext, in just the way we 

4

 do with every other discrimination case. 

5

 And that's what this is all about. 

It's 

6

 identifying the comparator that the employee has to 

7

 identify in the first instance in order to shift the 

8

 burden to the government to come back with a reason. 

9

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I think the second clause is 

10

 highly relevant to the question of comparators, but not 

11

 in the way that you are suggesting.  What the second 

12

 clause does, as this Court has laid out in Newport News 

13

 and in CalFed, is to explain when you are making those 

14

 comparisons that you don't look at women and men, which 

15

 is what you might do, as this Court did in Gilbert, 

16

 because it's sex discrimination that you are actually 

17

 classifying 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's the first clause. 

19

 But, I mean, instead of talking in the abstract, can you 

20

 give me any example of a case that a plaintiff would 

21

 lose under the first clause that puts pregnancy together 

22

 with sex. 

23

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I'm not sure that you could, 

24

 but that wasn't the function of the second clause.  And 

25

 Petitioner 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Then you are saying

2

 second clause adds nothing even though Congress said 

3

 "and."  There is one clause because of sex, includes 

4

 pregnancy, "and" something in addition.  But you are 

5

 saying it's not really in addition. 

6

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I think that grammatical 

7

 connector is very important in understanding how the two 

8

 clauses relate, for the following reason:  Petitioner's 

9

 construction would read the first clause out of the 

10

 statute entirely.  The words in the first clause are 

11

 "because of."  And this Court has consistently 

12

 understood those words across protected traits to 

13

 require that discrimination  in an intentional 

14

 discrimination case, that you have discrimination that 

15

 is actually motivated by the protected trait. 

16

 If the second clause does the work 

17

 Petitioner suggests, even if you could find the word 

18

 "source" in that where it's not in the text, it would 

19

 mean that you don't need to show that the protected 

20

 trait, pregnancy, actually motivated the adverse 

21

 treatment.  So his construction would read that out of 

22

 the statute entirely. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Halligan, what is wrong 

24

 with my middle ground?  It's not that Mr. Bagenstos and 

25

 the General's ground, because it allows the employer to 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

 come back and say:  I have a legitimate policy based on

2

 seniority, or even I have a legitimate policy based on 

3

 the source of the injury.  But it does put that as a 

4

 question whenever an employee is able to point to a 

5

 similar  to a class of people who are granted the 

6

 disability accommodation who aren't pregnant. 

7

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I just don't think it has any 

8

 anchor in the words of the statute itself.  The words 

9

 are 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Quite the opposite.  It 

11

 basically gives a function for what  the key words of 

12

 the statute are "other persons not so affected but 

13

 similar in their ability and inability to work."  What 

14

 is that doing?  What it does is it points to the 

15

 comparator that sets off the McDonnell Douglas test, 

16

 that forces the employer to come back and give a reason 

17

 for why it is that this ought not to be taken as 

18

 discrimination against pregnancy. 

19

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I think that this Court's 

20

 been clear that the function of the second clause is to 

21

 repudiate that logic which equates  when you look at 

22

 women and men and you have a pregnancy  a cause  a 

23

 policy that discriminates on the basis of pregnancy, you 

24

 say that is not sex discrimination.  What that would 

25

 also do is to collapse the distinction between disparate 

Alderson Reporting Company

 treatment and disparate intent.  This Court has been

2

 clear that that is an absolute line.  It said so in 

3

 Raytheon.  Congress tracked that distinction in the 1991 

4

 Civil Rights Act, and Justice Stevens in his dissent in 

5

 Gilbert itself which this Court said it was codifying 

6

 when it enacted the pregnancy discrimination 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if the language after 

8

 the semicolon were not there?  Would the language before 

9

 the semicolon have effectively overruled Gilbert? 

10
11
12

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

It would have overruled 

 Gilbert by bolting pregnancy on, but Congress was 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Would it have produced a 

13

 different result in Gilbert?  Suppose the employer has a 

14

 policy of providing certain benefits for employees who 

15

 have an injury or a disease but not pregnancy. 

16

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Right. 
If you didn't have the 

18

 language after the semicolon, would the language before 

19

 the semicolon have required the employer to treat 

20

 pregnant women the same as those who have an illness or 

21

 an injury? 

22

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I'm not sure that it would 

23

 have.  And I'm also not sure that it would have 

24

 precluded the Court from using the same logic that was 

25

 at play in Gilbert itself, and that's why those words 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1
2

 are there.
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Isn't that the reason for 

3

 the language after the semicolon?  Because you have to 

4

 go further in order to produce a different result than 

5

 Gilbert.  And if that's correct, could you explain what 

6

 you think the language after the semicolon means. 

7

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I think the language after 

8

 the semicolon instructs that when you look at a policy 

9

 that facially discriminates on the basis of pregnancy, 

10

 what you would typically do in a sex discrimination case 

11

 is to look at how women and men are treated.  And if 

12

 they are treated differently, you would conclude that 

13

 there is sex discrimination.  What this clause instructs 

14

 is that when you look at a policy that discriminates on 

15

 the basis of pregnancy, rather than looking at women and 

16

 men which would lead you to the conclusion that there is 

17

 no sex discrimination  because all the nonpregnant 

18

 women 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's what the first 

 clause does.  It says pregnancy and sex, period. 
 You have already said that you don't think 

22

 that the second clause does any practical work.  That 

23

 is, you can't conceive of a case where a plaintiff would 

24

 loose under clause one and win under clause two. 

25

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

To be clear, Your Honor, the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

 reason the second clause is there is to avoid a case in

2

 which a court uses the same reasoning and reaches a 

3

 different result.  This Court also attached special 

4

 significance to the second clause in Johnson Controls. 

5

 It said that the second clause provides a BFOQ for 

6

 pregnancy specifically, and so it does that work as 

7

 well. 

8
9

 What Petitioner suggests is that the second 
 clause somehow permits any distinction except onthejob 

10

 versus offthejob.  That's a distinction that is 

11

 longstanding and hasn't 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But you don't know where 

13

 the  I would like just to go back on this very point 

14

 to what Justice Kagan said.  Now, the McDonnell Douglas 

15

 test, I think, should come in somewhere.  That is the 

16

 the woman shows that, I'm pregnant, I couldn't lift, I 

17

 wasn't paid anything, and other people who had 

18

 comparable inabilities were paid.  And so we get to, was 

19

 I qualified like they are?  And now a distinction is 

20

 being made.  The employer says, no, you are not because 

21

 you didn't drive over the mountain pass.  Or, no, you 

22

 are not because you got it off the job.  And then we 

23

 have to decide is that a pretext?  Is it legitimate? 

24

 And where they are giving it to everybody else and there 

25

 are very few, it doesn't sound too legitimate.  But that 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

 test must come in.

2

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It does. 
And so  and so how does 

4

 it and does it matter if we put it under the first 

5

 socalled whatever, you know, intentional as opposed to 

6

 disparate impact?  Will we muck up the law were we to 

7

 say it goes in that part rather than the other part or 

8

 both parts? 

9

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

Well, I  I think if I can, 

10

 this Court has been clear that McDonnell Douglas 

11

 provides a mechanism for providing indirect evidence of 

12

 disparate treatment of intentional discrimination.  So 

13

 it's distinct, I think, from a disparate impact case 

14

 where, as here, you have a facially neutral policy, a 

15

 policy that says onthejob gets accommodation when they 

16

 can't perform the essential functions of their job, 

17

 anyone with an injury or condition that's sustained off 

18

 the job doesn't.  When you have a facially neutral 

19

 policy like that, you can bring a disparate impact 

20

 claim.  Peggy Young could have done that. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

 under disparate treatment? 

23

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

But why not if it goes 

Pardon? 
Why not?  Because, of 

 course, the employer will always have a facially neutral 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

 policy.  It just turns out that this facially neutral

2

 policy happens to hit the pregnant women and four other 

3

 people. 

4

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If 
And I mean, that  that's 

6

 the kind of thing that we're trying to stop in this 

7

 statute.  So  so why not bring it in there, in the 

8

 disparate treatment part as you say? 

9

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

Two answers, Your Honor. 
Yes. 
First of all, I think that 

12

 distinction between a disparate impact claim where 

13

 you're looking adverse effects on a certain class of 

14

 employees, but you have a facially neutral policy has 

15

 been quite  as distinct from a policy that 

16

 discriminates on its face, either directly or 

17

 indirectly 

18
19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Ms. Halligan, suppose 

 this 

20

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 that's well established. 
Suppose this, and it's 

22

 exactly what Justice Breyer is talking about.  Suppose 

23

 you had a policy that said we're going to provide 

24

 accommodations to  for anybody with a  a 

25

 nonoccupational sickness and  and accident.  Very 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

 similar to Gilbert 

2

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

4

Yes. 
 but without all the other 

 facts of Gilbert.  We're just  it's a facial policy. 

5

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
We're going to provide 

7

 accommodations, but, of course, pregnancy is not a 

8

 nonoccupational sickness and accident, so as a result of 

9

 this facially neutral policy, pregnant women will not 

10
11
12
13

 get accommodations. 
 Now, as I understand what you are saying, 
 it's  that's perfectly fine. 
 MS. HALLIGAN: 

If  if a policy 

14

 distinguishes between occupational injuries and 

15

 nonoccupational 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, this is nonoccupational 

 sickness and accident. 
 MS. HALLIGAN: 

And that would be acceptable. 

19

 And what a  what a plaintiff who believed that 

20

 nonetheless there was intentional discrimination afoot, 

21

 what they would do is they would, under McDonnell 

22

 Douglas, they would, first of all, attempt to make a 

23

 prime facia case by showing that other employees who 

24

 were similarly situated were being treated differently. 

25

 The comparators that the Petitioner points to here are 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

 not valid because they're not similarly situated.  The

2

 bottom line 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You are departing  you 

4

 are departing radically from what the Fourth 

5

 Circuit view in this  I mean, the Fourth Circuit did 

6

 say, right up front, that this clause standing alone is 

7

 unambiguous; if a group of employees get the benefit, if 

8

 other employees get the benefit, so must pregnant women. 

9

 But the Fourth Circuit said, yes, that's what it says 

10

 just standing alone, but because it would lead to 

11

 untoward results, preferential treatment, we're not 

12

 going to give it 

13

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

15

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

Well, the first 
 that meaning. 
The Fourth Circuit realized 

16

 that the two clauses have to be read together, and in 

17

 fact to read the second clause, as Petitioner suggests, 

18

 just  just reads the first clause out of existence. 

19

 Justice Kagan, to go back to your question, 

20

 what an employee could do in that circumstance is to 

21

 say, the policy doesn't treat similarly situated 

22

 employees the same as me.  It treats me worse. 

23

 The comparators here were not at all 

24

 congruous.  The first set of comparators were 

25

 individuals who were accommodated under the ADA.  The 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1
2

 government realizes that they're not similar 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But that's where we disagree 

3

 because  because what this tells you is it tells you 

4

 what the comparators are.  The comparators are any class 

5

 you can come up with who is  is  has the same 

6

 disability and isn't pregnant, and then the employer can 

7

 come back and say, no, we had a good reason to  to 

8

 treat that class of employees differently. 

9

 And if you  if you buy that with respect 

10

 to the Gilbert distinction, I don't understand why you 

11

 wouldn't buy it with respect to any other 

12

 classification. 

13

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

Because all the second clause 

14

 is telling you, and  and Congress was clear and this 

15

 Court was clear that the  that the PDA, both clauses, 

16

 in its entirety, were not intended to in any way depart 

17

 from traditional Title VII principles.  It was simply to 

18

 correct the fact that pregnancy could be sex 

19

 discrimination.  So all 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But we absolutely know that 

21

 what Gilbert was  said was that kind of policy was 

22

 legitimate and that Congress came back and said, no, 

23

 that kind of policy is illegitimate, right? 

24
25

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

It said two things.  It said 

 it's illegitimate in the first clause and it said you 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

 cannot, when you are trying to ascertain if there's sex

2

 discrimination, with a pregnancy policy, break it down 

3

 into women and men because you won't get the result 

4

 Congress wants.  Congress says when it's facially 

5

 discriminatory on the basis of pregnancy, that's sex 

6

 discrimination. 

7

 So the comparators do have to be different; 

8

 you are correct.  It's pregnant employees and 

9

 nonpregnant employees.  And  and 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But as I understand the 

11

 answer to my question, and tell me if I'm wrong, is 

12

 you're saying with respect to a facially neutral policy 

13

 as to nonoccupational sickness and health 

14

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

16

 is illegal under the PDA. 

17
18

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

Yes. 
 that you think that that 

No.  It's legal under the 

 PDA.  A policy that 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

20

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I'm sorry 
 that distinguishes between 

21

 occupational and nonoccupational injuries and is evenly 

22

 applied is absolutely permissible under the PDA. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Even if it's  it's exactly 

24

 the policy that's in Gilbert, and you're saying that's 

25

 fine? 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1
2
3

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

No.  The policy in Gilbert

 singled out pregnancy for this favor. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It didn't.  There were lots 

4

 of other things except for pregnancy that got excluded 

5

 in Gilbert. 

6

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

The Court 
If  if a man had a 

8

 vasectomy, it got excluded in Gilbert.  If somebody got 

9

 into a bar fight, it got excluded under the policy in 

10

 Gilbert.  If a person had cosmetic surgery, it got 

11

 excluded under the policy in Gilbert.  Gilbert was about 

12

 much more than singling out. 

13

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

This Court and Congress 

14

 clearly described the policy in Gilbert as singling out 

15

 pregnancy and that's why Congress enacted the PDA, 

16

 because 

17
18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 to overturn Gilbert, everybody 

19

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

21

But it  it enacted it 

It's holding and 
 and not just some 

 abstract theory, but the result 

22

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
 in Gilbert.  And as 

24

 Justice Kagan pointed out, Gilbert was a case where you 

25

 could point to a lot of other people who were not 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1
2

 getting this benefit.
 MS. HALLIGAN: 

One of  the result that 

3

 Petitioner and the government suggests, which is instead 

4

 to say that you can have any distinction you want and 

5

 it's permissible under the PDA except on the job versus 

6

 off the job is  is far more contorted.  That's a 

7

 distinction that sounds in worker's compensation law. 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is it  is it true 

 essentially  I mean, you said that  that Young's 

10

 position is most favored nation.  Well, yours is least 

11

 favored nation, right? 

12

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

It's  it's not least 

13

 favored nation.  The question is, is there another 

14

 distinct group of employees who are treated the same as 

15

 the Petitioner, and here there are.  And this is 

16

 where 

17
18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

This  this case went 

 off on summary judgment 

19

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
 so the facts 

21

 Mr. Bagenstos has told us that there is not in this 

22

 record a single instance of anyone who needed a lifting 

23

 dispensation who didn't get it except for pregnant 

24

 people. 

25

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

And I 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1
2
3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And if that's the case in

 fact, then you lose, don't you? 
 MS. HALLIGAN: 

Well, I would like to address 

4

 that because I think that's a real mischaracterization 

5

 of the record in a couple of ways.  First of all, the 

6

 district court held, squarely, that the effort by 

7

 plaintiff to characterize this policy as no light duty 

8

 for pregnancy was wrong.  What the district court 

9

 said  this is at page 59A  is that the actual policy 

10
11

 was onthejob ADA accommodations and DOT. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But do we know in fact 

12

 this is an allegation that in fact no one who wanted a 

13

 dispensation didn't get it except pregnant women. 

14
15
16

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

That is also contradicted, 

 Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But we have  we're on 

17

 the summary judgment stage, so we don't know what the 

18

 facts are. 

19

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

No, but we have to look at 

20

 the uncontroverted evidence.  There's uncontroverted 

21

 testimony in the record, and I would point you to 

22

 Ms. Martin and Mr. Brian's testimony that there were 

23

 many employees who sustained offthejob injuries, and 

24

 the district court held specifically that no light duty 

25

 was given to any employees, male or female, with any 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

 medical conditions not related to work, pregnancy

2

 included, at page 56A.  It also 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can you give an example 

4

 then?  Is there an employee who asked for a dispensation 

5

 because of a medical condition that restricted her 

6

 ability to lift, to any single employee employed  who 

7

 was  said, sorry, you don't get it because your injury 

8

 was off duty? 

9

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

There's not a name provided 

10

 in the record because one was not elicited by the 

11

 Petitioner whose burden it was in building a prima facie 

12

 case.  But the record evidence is undisputed that there 

13

 were many employees who sustained offthejob injuries 

14

 and it's unsurprising.  UPS is in the business of 

15

 delivering packages. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

They  they suffered 

17

 offthejob injuries, but we don't know if they asked 

18

 for a dispensation because the offthejob injury would 

19

 require that they limit the weight that they could bear. 

20

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

The district court held that 

21

 UPS's policy is that employees who are unable to perform 

22

 the essential functions of their job would be required 

23

 to take leave if their inability stemmed from something 

24

 off the job.  And in a business that involves moving 

25

 70pound packages around all day long, it is certainly 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

 the case that, as the uncontroverted testimony

2

 established, there were many employees who sustained an 

3

 offthejob injury that prevented them from doing that 

4

 job. 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I assume that you disagree 

6

 with the Petitioner  the Petitioner's proposition that 

7

 when you take these three classes, namely, off the 

8

 job  I'm sorry, onthejob injuries, ADA injuries, and 

9

 the  what was the third one? 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Traffic certificates. 
Yes, yes, getting 

12

 disapproved as drivers by DOT.  There's almost nothing 

13

 left.  That's  that's what 

14

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

We absolutely disagree with 

15

 that and there is nothing in the record which suggests 

16

 that.  It is completely without citation or support and 

17

 it's completely controverted by the testimony that there 

18

 were many employees who did sustain an offthejob 

19

 injury. 

20

 So there were three narrow exceptions 

21

 absolutely, the three that you identified, but every 

22

 employee, as the District Court held, that sustained an 

23

 offthejob injury pulled their back, turned their knee, 

24

 whatever it is, couldn't come in to work, were not 

25

 accommodated with the kind of light duty that Ms. Young 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1
2

 was.
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So why shouldn't there be a 

3

 trial on that or further proceedings?  If it turns out 

4

 that they're right that there were four people who 

5

 weren't pregnant, and that's all, who didn't get the 

6

 benefits, that's pretty strong evidence that the 

7

 employer is discriminating.  If there were 400,000 

8

 people who got the thing off the job and there were 

9

 only, like, 19 people on the job who got the benefit, 

10

 well, then you have a better case.  So why don't we have 

11

 to look at the facts? 

12

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

First of all, Your Honor, 

13

 that would be relevant to a disparate impact claim which 

14

 the Petitioner did not bring. 

15

 Secondly, there was extensive discovery in 

16

 this case.  There was a summary judgment granted with 

17

 uncontroverted evidence that establishes exactly the 

18

 opposite of what you are suggesting, so there is no need 

19

 to do that. 

20

 This is a very straightforward case and but 

21

 for the effort by the Petitioner to bring the record 

22

 back into play at this late date, none of this  none 

23

 of this would be something that you would ever consider 

24

 at this point. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is there really a dispute 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1
2

 about this?
 Maybe Petitioner's counsel could address it 

3

 in rebuttal, but is there really a dispute that if a UPS 

4

 driver fell off his allterrain vehicle during  on the 

5

 weekend and was unable to lift that that person would 

6

 not be given light duty?  Is there really a 

7

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

There's no dispute at all and 

8

 the District Court made a square finding exactly to that 

9

 effect at page 56A and page 35A.  I would also direct 

10

 you in our red brief to page 5 where we set forth 

11

 Ms. Martin's testimony that she never authorized an 

12

 accommodation for anyone who was injured off the job, so 

13

 that's there as well. 

14

 I'd like to turn briefly, if I can, to the 

15

 question of the EEOC guidance that the solicitor 

16

 general 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I  but there are 

18

 individuals who are injured off the job who lose their 

19

 DOT licenses? 

20

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

There are individuals who 

21

 lose their DOT certification and pursuant to the 

22

 collective bargaining agreement, they are accommodated 

23

 for some period of time.  But those jobs, the 

24

 individuals who lose their DOT certification, are not 

25

 lightduty jobs.  Those are heavylifting jobs, as the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

 District Court squarely held.  The District Court at

2

 page 36A and 59A said, "Inside jobs are not lightduty 

3

 jobs and the individuals who lose their license can 

4

 perform any number of demanding physical tasks," which 

5

 Ms. Young could not perform.  So they're not comparable 

6

 in that regard either. 

7

 With respect to the EEOC guidance, the 

8

 guidance which was issued two weeks after this Court 

9

 granted certiorari is 180degree change from the 

10

 position that the government has consistently taken and 

11

 that the postal service, which UPS fairly looked to in 

12

 trying to ascertain what appropriate conduct was under 

13

 federal antidiscrimination laws, the policy that it 

14

 still has in place today. 

15

 In addition, the process in issuing that 

16

 guidance was incredibly rushed.  It was not until 2012, 

17

 as one of the amicus briefs point out, that the EEOC 

18

 even identified the question of pregnancy accommodations 

19

 as an emerging or developing issue.  There was no notice 

20

 and comment.  The three 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The original  the 

22

 original guideline, as I understand EEOC, what they did 

23

 in 2014, they said, we were terse the first time around. 

24

 All we're doing in 2014 is explaining that what the 

25

 original  what was  it was '79, the original 

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

'79 guidelines, the '79

2

 guidelines simply mimic the language of the statute.  In 

3

 2012 the EEOC, in its strategic plan, said that it was 

4

 looking at addressing the very issue that it opined on 

5

 in the 2014 guidance as emerging.  If the 1979 

6

 guidelines stood for what Petitioner suggests, there 

7

 would have been no need to treat it as emerging.  It 

8

 would have been settled 30 years ago. 

9

 Finally, I want to point out that this is an 

10

 area where the democratic process is working as it 

11

 should and as this Court instructed it should in Cal 

12

 Fed.  In Cal Fed, this Court looked at the question of 

13

 whether or not state statutes which provided 

14

 preferential treatment to pregnant employees, the 

15

 statute there provided extra leave and reinstatement 

16

 rights to pregnant employees, was preempted by the PDA. 

17

 The Court said the PDA sets a floor.  That floor is that 

18

 you can't single out pregnancy for adverse treatment. 

19

 States can go beyond that as additional and new 

20

 challenges are identified. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Ms. Halligan, for the 

22

 democratic process to work as it should, the PDA has to 

23

 be given a fair reading.  And what we know about the PDA 

24

 is that it was supposed to be about removing stereotypes 

25

 of pregnant women as marginal workers.  It was supposed 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

 to be about ensuring that they wouldn't be unfairly

2

 excluded from the workplace.  And what you are saying is 

3

 that there's a policy that accommodates some workers, 

4

 but puts all pregnant women on one side of the line. 

5

 And what you are further saying is that the 

6

 employer doesn't even have to justify that policy ala 

7

 McDonnell Douglas.  That seems to me a reading of the 

8

 statute, the PDA, that ignores twothirds of the text. 

9

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

I'm not saying that the 

10

 employer isn't subject to a suit under McDonnell 

11

 Douglas.  I'm saying that there are no valid comparators 

12

 here.  That's  that's all  all that we're saying in 

13

 that regard. 

14

 The states that 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So essentially it says 

16

 any group that doesn't get the benefit, a group that is 

17

 nonpregnant, then pregnant people are  any group at 

18

 all? 

19

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

If you had a policy, I'm not 

20

 sure what one would look like, that singled out pregnant 

21

 employees plus one other employee, my guess is that 

22

 you'd find 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What category of 

 employees? 
 MS. HALLIGAN: 

The policy that's at issue 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

 here, Justice Ginsburg, distinguishes onthejob versus

2

 offthejob injuries.  That's a distinction that's 

3

 echoed in state and in federal law.  That's a far cry 

4

 from a policy that singles out pregnant women.  There 

5

 are nine states that 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

7

 first  is what the first 

8
9

 MS. HALLIGAN: 

Singling out is in the 

Or targeting or otherwise 

 primarily disadvantaging.  That distinction tracks what 

10

 workers' comp requires, which is payment for employees 

11

 who are injured on the job, and many employers, 

12

 including the U.S. Postal Service, have found it 

13

 advantageous to provide lightduty accommodations so 

14

 their employees can be at work while they are 

15

 rehabilitating and provide some productive work for the 

16

 company.  That distinction is as legitimate as you could 

17

 get. 

18

 I see my time is up, Your Honor.

 remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL BAGENSTOS 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

 Justice. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

 So I'd like to begin, if I could, with the

2

 facts, because Justice Alito did ask, and, yes, we 

3

 certainly do disagree with UPS's  UPS's assertion 

4

 here.  This case was on summary judgment and UPS does 

5

 point correctly to some very general statements in the 

6

 record by UPS managers that they never authorized these 

7

 accommodations.  However, we point to specific examples 

8

 in the record of people with offthejob injuries or 

9

 illnesses who were DOT decertified who were given 

10

 accommodations, and not just accommodations that remove 

11

 them from driving but also remove them from heavy 

12

 lifting.  That's a factual dispute that has to go to 

13

 trial. 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You really think that you 

15

 could prove at trial that if somebody is injured in a 

16

 recreational activity over the weekend that they get 

17

 light duty but a pregnant women does not maybe? 

18

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

So if someone is injured 

19

 over the weekend in a way that leads them to be DOT 

20

 decertified, yes, and in fact, the UPS manager so 

21

 testified about his sports injury.  We cite that in our 

22

 opening brief.  So yes, we think so. 

23

 The second point I'd like to make is about 

24

 what the two clauses do, and I think this is very 

25

 important.  So the first clause of the PDA, as this 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

 Court has said in Newport News and Cal Fed, overturns

2

 the reasoning in General Electric v. Gilbert.  So what 

3

 the first clause says is where Gilbert said, look, 

4

 discrimination based on pregnancy isn't sex 

5

 discrimination because there are pregnant women and 

6

 nonpregnant persons, that's wrong instead because a 

7

 pregnancy is because of sex definitionally.  That's not 

8

 what the second clause does, that's what the first 

9

 clause does. 

10

 The second clause, as this Court said again 

11

 in Newport News and Cal Fed, goes further and overrules 

12

 the holding.  And I think Justice Kagan was exactly 

13

 correct in describing the facts of Gilbert, that the 

14

 Gilbert holding would not be overturned by  under 

15

 UPS's reading here because the Gilbert policy, the one 

16

 thing we know that Congress meant to say was illegal, 

17

 the Gilbert policy itself acted, drew lines in 

18

 pregnancyneutral ways. 

19

 It said if you have an offthejob injury or 

20

 accident, defined as an offthejob illness or accident 

21

 defined as an accidental injury, then you get disability 

22

 benefits.  It just so happens pregnancy isn't an illness 

23

 and pregnancy isn't an accident in the sense of an 

24

 accidental injury.  And what Congress  we know 

25

 Congress was trying to do, because Congress said it and 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

 this Court has said it, is to overturn the holding

2

 there. 

3

 But UPS's rule simply reprices the rule at 

4

 issue in Gilbert.  If I might return to the point 

5

 Justice Breyer's made a couple of times at various points 

6

in the argument

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Actually I think the 

8

 reverse.  The second sentence is what does that.  The 

9

 second sentence says you don't worry about whether it's 

10

 between sexes.  You worry about whether the same class 

11

 of people, people who are injured offduty, are being 

12

 treated differently when they have the same ability to 

13

 work. 

14

 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, I think, Justice 

15

 Sotomayor, the first clause says you don't worry about 

16

 whether they're the same sex or not.  You don't look at 

17

 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, you do have to worry 

 about it because it still has to be sex discrimination. 
 MR. BAGENSTOS: 

Well, no.  But the first 

21

 clause definitionally defines pregnancy discrimination 

22

 as sex discrimination.  It says if you're discriminating 

23

 because of pregnancy, that is because of sex.  And 

24

 that's the  that's overturning the Gilbert reasoning 

25

 coming from Geduldig that pregnancy discrimination isn't 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1
2

 sex discrimination. 
 The second clause goes further, as this

3

 Court's explained, and overturns the holding, overturns 

4

 the holding upholding the General Electric policy.  And 

5

 so  and I think under  under UPS's rule it wouldn't 

6

 do that. 

7

 On Justice Breyer's question, basically how 

8

 do we deal with a world where there's an employer that 

9

 treats two different groups of people who are 

10

 nonpregnant differently?  Does "shall be treated the 

11

 same" mean shall be treated the same as those who get 

12

 the better deal or those who get the worst deal; right? 

13

 And I think Justice Ginsburg and Justice 

14

 Kagan I think articulated this well, that their position 

15

 really would give least favored nation status to 

16

 pregnant workers and we know that that can't be 

17

 something that Congress intended.  We know that in part 

18

 because of what General Verrilli said, that that's not 

19

 how antidiscrimination law works, the fact that someone 

20

 else was discriminated against doesn't mean I lose. 

21

 Justice Alito's opinion for the Third 

22

 Circuit in the Fraternal Order of Police of Newark case 

23

 articulates the same rule.  We know that as well because 

24

 the purpose of this statute is to say to employers, as 

25

 Justice Kagan said, you have to treat pregnant workers 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

 as just as valued employees as anybody else, and if you 

2

 think it's valuable to keep these employees on the job

3

 who are injured on the job because they keep valuable 

4

 work  valuable knowledge within the company, do that 

5

 for pregnant women.
