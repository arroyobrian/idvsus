5

United States.

 Mr. Badalamenti. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. BADALAMENTI 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 

11

 The natural, sensible and contextual reading 

12

of Section 1519 is that the phrase "record document or 

13

tangible object" is confined to records, documents and 

14

devices designed to preserve information, the very 

15

matters involved in the Enron debacle.  Given the 

16

expansive Federal nexus of this statute, which is the 

17

intent to influence the proper administration of any 

18

matter within the jurisdiction of the United States, it 

19

is implausible that Congress would have passed sub 

20

silentio, an allencompassing obstruction statute buried 

21

within the altering documents provision of the 

22

SarbanesOxley Act. 

23

 A strong textual indicator that Section 1519 

24

is confined to recordrelated offenses is the inclusion 

25

of the unique term "makes false entry in," which

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress only uses in recordrelated statutes.  The 

2

canons of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis confirm 

3

that tangible object is related to the common thread 

4

between record and document which are information 

5

devices  information mediums. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why should  why should 

7

the expression "tangible object," which stands alone, 

8

it's not falsifying documents, why should the word 

9

"object" in 1519 be treated differently than the word 

10
11

"other object" in 1512  1512(c)? 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Justice Ginsburg, in 

12

Section 1519  it was passed at the same time as 

13

1512(c) as part of the SarbanesOxley Act.  And as this 

14

Court held in Russello, when Congress includes different 

15

terms in different statutes passed in the same act, it 

16

is intended to mean something different. 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So you think there's a 

difference between "tangible object" and "other object"? 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Yes, there is.  The first 

20

reason is that the inclusion of "makes false entry in" 

21

indicates that the phrase "record document and tangible 

22

objects" refers to recordkeeping.  Another difference is 

23

that  a common sense standpoint  is that records can 

24

only be maintained on tangible mediums.  And it's a 

25

distinguishing factor between "record document" and

4

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

"other objects" in 1512(c).  It's also limited 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But how does the 

3

Internet  you could falsify Internet entries, or 

4

things that are in the cloud, those are intangible 

5

items. 

6

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

No, those are tangible 

7

items, Your Honor, because they are stored on a hard 

8

drive somewhere.  The cloud is not existing above.  It's 

9

merely being housed somewhere else that's accessed 

10

through the Internet on a tangible device that's 

11

designed to preserve that very type of information. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose a typewriter 

13

were used to prepare an incriminating document.  The 

14

document and the typewriter were destroyed, would that 

15

be covered? 

16

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

The typewriter would not 

17

be.  The piece of paper that the typewriter is 

18

inscribing on is a device that's designed to preserve 

19

information.  It's simply making the information. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I  I understand the 

21

argument and the argument that you make has considerable 

22

force about over criminalizing, but it seems to me that 

23

the test you suggest has almost more problems with 

24

vagueness, more problems with determining what its 

25

boundaries are than the government's test.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

No, the government's test 

2

renders 1512(c) wholly superfluous.  1519  first of 

3

all, the words "record document" and "tangible object" 

4

are definitions providing meaning to all of them.  The 

5

government is saying admittedly, "record" and "document" 

6

didn't need to be there and Congress had no reason to 

7

put them there because it's everything, it's all 

8

physical evidence.  A record  a tangible object is a 

9

discrete device.  It is a device that is designed to 

10

preserve the information. 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if that's the  if 

12

that is the case, then why is it not surplusage?  Why 

13

what would be a tangible object designed to contain 

14

information that would not fall into the category of 

15

record or document? 

16
17
18

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

An iPad, a laptop 

computer, a desktop computer, an iPhone.  Those 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Those things in themselves 

19

don't  they have documents, they have something that 

20

could be called a document or a record stored in them. 

21

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That is 
If you  if you have an 

23

iPad that's straight from the store, has nothing  has 

24

no information stored in that, do you think that would 

25

fall within the statute?

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It would fall within the 

2

statute because what Congress was trying to intend to do 

3

 and given the backdrop of the Enron situation where 

4

massive servers were destroyed or deleted or otherwise 

5

 they were trying to  to capture the devices that 

6

held information.  And you cannot determine what's on 

7

the device unless you have the device, regardless of 

8

whether or not there's information on it or not. 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What about destroying a 

brand new empty filing cabinet? 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

That is not a device 

12

that's used to preserve information.  That's a container 

13

of something.  It's not specifically designed to 

14

preserve information.  You could put bowling balls in 

15

a  in a filing cabinet or otherwise.  The information, 

16

the distinguishing factor, Your Honor, between a 

17

tangible object is that the information is being 

18

preserved within it, embedded within it, like a computer 

19

or otherwise.  And Congress needed to use the general 

20

phrase "tangible object" for a reason, because in 2002, 

21

an iPad, an iPhone, and many other electronic devices 

22

that preserve information didn't exist, and they 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But then the Congress 

24

could have said used  tangible object used to preserve 

25

information, and then your case would be solid.  But it

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

just said "tangible object." 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It said "tangible object," 

3

that is true, Justice Ginsburg, that it said "tangible 

4

object."  But it did so using that general phrase 

5

following two specific terms, "record" and "document," 

6

which is a classic methodology in which the legislature 

7

uses 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But could I go back to 

Justice Ginsburg's first question, because, my fault I'm 

10

sure, but I wasn't sure I understood your answer.  Not 

11

only in 1512(c)(1), but there are, you know, I think 

12

five times in 1512 from a prior enactment this same kind 

13

of phrase is used, which is "record document and other 

14

object."  And you say that we should treat that phrase 

15

as it exists many times in 1512 differently from this 

16

phrase in 1519 because of the difference between 

17

tangible object and other object.  And to me, it seems 

18

like other object is, if anything, a more classic case 

19

of that canon that I can't pronounce the name of, 

20

ejusdem whatever. 

21

 (Laughter.) 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

24

on my colleague for. 

25

 (Laughter.)

Generis. 
Good.  That's what I count 

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

2

 But to me, it seems like a more  even a 

I  I deserved that. 

3

more classic case.  So I guess I just don't understand 

4

why you're treating the two differently. 

5

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It is, to answer your 

6

question, they're being treated differently not simply 

7

because of the inclusion of the word "tangible," but 

8

because of the other words surrounding "tangible 

9

object," like the unique phrase "makes faltering entry 

10

in," which is not included in any other obstruction of 

11

justice statute. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But just because Congress 

13

includes more verbs  I mean, the reason Congress 

14

includes 20 verbs instead of 4 is presumably because 

15

Congress really wants to sweep in a very wide variety of 

16

conduct.  And not every verb has to apply to every 

17

situation.  In fact, we rather presume that they won't. 

18

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Although this Court has 

19

never held that all the verbs, you know, applied to all 

20

the nouns, it would make sense that they would apply. 

21

The only instance that the United States points out is 

22

in an amended statute.  This statute was written from 

23

"Whoever" to the last word of this statute at the same 

24

time.  It makes sense that they all apply.  And "makes 

25

false entry in" is a phrase that can be used only to

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

apply to all of the nouns under our particular 

2

construction.  And it's unique.  It is only used by 

3

Congress in recordrelated statutes. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So your whole argument here 

5

really comes down to the fact that Congress put some 

6

recordrelated verbs in there? 

7

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It does not, Your Honor. 

8

There's additional things.  We have a limited subject 

9

matter under our definition, which makes sense because 

10

you have a tremendously broad nexus to any matter within 

11

the proper administration of the United States.  That's 

12

unlike traditional classic statutes.  It makes sense 

13

that Congress wanted to narrow the subject matter of 

14

this particular statute when you're dealing with such a 

15

broad nexus to any Federal matter. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I would think  I'm 

17

sorry.  I would think that that cuts against you, that 

18

the fact that this is about any matter within the 

19

jurisdiction of any agency in the United States shows 

20

that it's really not just about corporate fraud, that 

21

Congress had a broader set of things in mind.  So I 

22

would think that that's  that's quite the opposite, 

23

that everything about this statute, the "any matter," 

24

the "any record," suggests breadth. 

25

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It  it does not, Your

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Honor, because if you take the lens and you zoom it out 

2

a little bit further, if we look at Section 802 of Title 

3

VIII of the SarbanesOxley Act, it's entitled "Criminal 

4

Penalties For Altering Documents."  Two new criminal 

5

statutes were created:  1519, entitled "Destruction, 

6

alteration, and falsification of records;" and 1520, 

7

which is a 5year record retention requirement on 

8

auditors.  They were  or else they get a 10year 

9

penalty for that. 

10

 Congress was referring, passing these, 1519 

11

and 1520 within Section 802 of Title VIII, as a tandem, 

12

as another contextual indicator that this is intended to 

13

apply to recordrelated matters. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Then how do you  how do 

15

you respond to the illustration that the government gave 

16

in its brief?  That is, what sense does it make to say 

17

you can be indicted under 1519 if you destroy a letter 

18

that the victim that you have murdered has sent you, but 

19

you can't be indicted under 1519 if you destroy the 

20

murder weapon? 

21

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Congress did not intend 

22

1519 to be applied in that situation.  And as you state 

23

the question, Justice Ginsburg, it is remarkable that 

24

the government would use 1519 in a murder situation. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you think it could 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would  let me back up and ask what I assume was  you 

2

would say yes to.  A letter is shredded.  It's a letter 

3

from the victim to the laterturnedouttobe murderer. 

4

That letter is shredded.  Does that come under 1519? 

5

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

That does, because that is 

6

record related.  But the knife does not.  That falls 

7

into the sweep  that particular subject matter, 

8

because it indeed is a record, so that would be covered 

9

under 1519, but that  not the knife.  Congress didn't 

10
11
12
13

intend to sweep the knife into 1519, but 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Where did the  I'm 

sorry. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What if the knife 

14

had the defendant's name on it?  Is that, destroying the 

15

knife, is that altering, destroying a record? 

16

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It is not.  One would not, 

17

Mr. Chief Justice, refer to an inscription of one's name 

18

as a permanent account of an event.  It's just an 

19

identification.  It's an identification on the knife. 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but presumably 

21

the same would be true of a lot of documents or records 

22

that are destroyed. 

23

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

But in ordinary parlance, 

24

one would not consider an inscription on a knife to be 

25

it.  It's evidence, but it's not a  it's not a

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

document, it's not a record or otherwise, and it doesn't 

2

fall within the very limited subject matter that 

3

Congress wrote into this particular statute, which is 

4

records. 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, what do you say 

about 1512(c)?  Would the knife fall under that? 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

1519 and '12(c), it would 

8

make more sense that the knife fall in, and here's why. 

9

It's a more classic 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Even if the knife was 

11

used in the murder, but it was destroyed before anybody 

12

was caught? 

13

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It would  it would  if 

14

it was destroyed with the intent to impair that object's 

15

availability in an official proceeding, which is a 

16

classic, classic obstruction statute 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So did the government 

18

mischarge here?  Could they have charged your client 

19

with violating 1512(c)? 

20

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It's possible the 

21

government could have charged that particular thing, 

22

but 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I love those words, 

"possible." 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It is possible.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

What would  what would 

have been your defense if they did? 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

My defense would have been 

5

something very significant, difference between 1512(c) 

6

and 1519.  1519 only requires that

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I know you were charged

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

He didn't corruptly do it. 

10

And corruptly is wrongful, immoral, depraved or evil, 

11

not simply knowingly, which is required under 1519, 

12

which is voluntarily and intentionally done.  See, 

13

"corruptly" is used in 1512(c) purposefully in that 

14

particular information because it is, perhaps, a broader 

15

class, and it is 

16
17
18
19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

substituting fish is not a corrupt act. 
 MR. BADALAMENTI:

defense.

Which was the question, 

Your Honor.  Okay? 

24

 So what we  what we have in 1519  what 

25

we have in 1519 is a remarkable situation when you're

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

looking at Chapter 73 in total, is that you have this 

2

incredibly broad nexus to any Federal matter within the 

3

jurisdiction of the United States.  What can the matter 

4

be?  As the amicus briefs point out, any of 300,000 

5

Federal regulations that the Federal Government has 

6

placed down upon the American people. 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And what is your view, 

8

given what you've just said, of the best way to narrow 

9

this statute? 

10

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

The best way to narrow 

11

this statute, Justice Breyer, is to interpret "tangible 

12

object" in the company it keeps, and that is a device 

13

that is designed to preserve information such that if 

14

that device is destroyed, the information contained on 

15

that device is destroyed. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You still have the problem 

17

of the language of the statute covering the destruction 

18

of a document such as an EPA questionnaire that comes to 

19

the door asking about recycling, where you know that the 

20

EPA would like to have that back to help them do their 

21

official work of finding out how the program works. 

22

You, believing that that's their business, not yours, 

23

tear it up and throw it in the wastebasket. 

24

 Now, does that fall within the statute? 

25

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Well, it

 JUSTICE BREYER: 
language. 

3

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5
6

It surely does within the 

It falls within 
And your effort to narrow 

the statute has nothing to do with that. 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

The narrowing is the 

7

document itself.  This statute's exceedingly broad. 

8

Our 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But my problem, of course, 

10

is reading the statute and taking your argument in the 

11

context that you mean it, which is we must look for a 

12

way to narrow this statute, which at first blush seems 

13

far broader than any witnesstampering statute, any 

14

obstruction of justice statute, any not lying to an FBI 

15

agent statute that I've ever seen, let alone those 

16

within Section 15.  So what I'd like you to focus on is 

17

not your problem, though they're connected, but my 

18

problem. 

19

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Focusing on your problem, 

20

Justice Breyer, I would say that it is not an onerous 

21

situation for individuals to retain documents.  It is 

22

not an onerous situation on the American people to 

23

with particularly what we have on flash drives attached to a 

24

key chain that can hold thousands and thousands 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right.  I see where you're

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going. 

2

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 of documents. 
I see where you're going. 

4

Let's follow you down that road:  That you say in many 

5

situations it should not be a crime to retain a 

6

document, even though you know that the Census Bureau 

7

would like it back or perhaps the EPA. 

8

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Uhhuh. 
And perhaps it's nothing 

10

more than trying to find out information.  But where you 

11

end up at the end of the road is that this is void for 

12

vagueness, but not for any reason you have yet told us. 

13

So what am I to do with the fact, if that is a serious 

14

problem, that it has never been argued in this case? 

15

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Well, I would accept the 

16

invitation that it would be void for vagueness, Your 

17

Honor. 

18
19

Why is it vague?  It's 

it's just incredibly expansive.

want to pose it as a question to me 

3

 (Laughter). 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 would be that the void 

5

for vagueness, if you look at Skilling, has two 

6

branches.  From Kolender v. Lawson  Justice Ginsburg 

7

wrote it  a penal statute defining the criminal 

8

offense, one, with sufficient definiteness that ordinary 

9

people can understand.  That's what Justice Scalia has 

10

just talked about.  You can understand what is 

11

prohibited. 

12

 But then there is two: 

In a manner that 

13

does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory 

14

enforcement.  It's that second part, that the doctrine 

15

extends the doctrine to statutes that, while they may be 

16

clear, are far too broad, well beyond what any sensible 

17

prosecutor would even want to prosecute. 

18

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20
21

Well, I agree with that. 
All right.  Then back to 

the question. 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

The answer  the answer 

22

would be that perhaps a way to reconcile this statute 

23

would be not only to accept our position that it relates 

24

to recordkeeping generally, but that it requires 

25

specifically, relates to business recordkeeping, where

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

businesses are on notice such as is he filing quarterly 

2

requirements or otherwise, that they are to do specific 

3

things.  And if you look against the backdrop of the 

4

SarbanesOxley Act, there is plenty of support that 

5

Congress was targeting businesses, corporations, and 

6

publicly traded companies. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Isn't  isn't running a 

8

fishing vessel a business? 

9

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It would be running a 

10

business, Your Honor, it would be.  And a possible way 

11

to limit this particular circumstance would be to limit 

12

it to  to businesses.  It doesn't change the fact that 

13

"tangible object" doesn't mean everything. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can you  can you tell 

15

me the exact consequences for your client?  Because as I 

16

understand it, he was also charged under 22  what is 

17

it  2232? 

18

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

20
21

Yes, Your Honor. 
And he could have gotten 

the same sentence? 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

No.  No, Your Honor.  2232 

22

is destroying a piece of property subject to seizure. 

23

That's a 5year statutory maximum.  1519 has a 20year 

24

statutory maximum. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But he in fact got what?

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

30 days. 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

30  he ended up getting 

3

30 days by a judge that made that individualized 

4

decision under the Booker factors.  But we can't count 

5

on judges being like those  that judge around the 

6

United States.  The fact remains is that 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you're only arguing 

for your client.  This is not some kind of class action. 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

No, Your Honor, this is 

10

just related to Mr. Yates.  But the idea is that  my 

11

understanding is that when the courts are writing the 

12

opinions, they're thinking about all the judges in the 

13

United States and providing guidance to all the judges, 

14

providing guidance to the prosecutors when to use 

15

particular statutes. 

16

 And if this Court permits that this statute 

17

be applied for the disposal of all physical evidence 

18

that would contravene the textual and contextual terms 

19

and indicators that I brought through throughout this 

20

argument, it is basically the overreaching broad thing 

21

that Congress has never passed, despite the government's 

22

attempt to inject in the Model Penal Code into this 

23

case, which 1519 looks nothing like the Model Penal 

24

Code. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose the fisherman took

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

pictures of the fish, and then he destroyed both the 

2

pictures and the fish.  Liability? 

3

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

A picture?  Although 

4

Congress didn't intend this in this circumstance, and we 

5

would hope the prosecutor wouldn't prosecute for this, 

6

it is a permanent account of an event that is preserving 

7

the information as to what the pictures  what the fish 

8

looked like.  So the fish thrown overboard indeed would 

9

be a record and would be covered under this statute. 

10

But it wouldn't be a tangible object because it's not a 

11

device designed to preserve the information. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The photograph isn't? 

13

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

The photo  I'm sorry, 

14

the photograph is not a tangible object under our 

15

definition.  If it were a digital camera and it's stored 

16

on a memory card on it, that would be a tangible object. 

17
18
19
20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is a piece of paper a 

physical object? 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

A piece of paper is a 

piece of paper, a physical object. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is it an object? 

22

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It's an object as well. 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But why isn't a film if 

24

it's on it  I'm talking not about a film on one of 

25

these screens, but an oldtime film that you can pick

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

up.  A picture, a picture. 

2

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Well, they  it is  the 

3

film itself is a record.  The film itself is a record. 

4

It's not 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

6

violation of this Act? 

7

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Yes, it would be. 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems very odd that you

10
11

Would its destruction be a 

can throw away the fish without violating the Act, but 
you can't throw away the picture. 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Although it's not what 

12

Congress intended, it's what requires that this statute 

13

read even under our interpretation, which brings up the 

14

absurdity of this particular case.  This underscores 

15

everything about this case that's absurd, is that the 

16

prosecutor used this statute in this way.  And had he 

17

thrown a piece of paper overboard that had the day's 

18

catch logs on it, that would have been covered, and we 

19

concede that that would have been covered. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, then why is that 

21

absurd?  If you concede that that would have been 

22

covered, the catch logs, and the prosecutor is trying to 

23

do the exact same thing, it's just that he's thrown over 

24

a different piece of evidence, why is that such a crazy 

25

outcome?

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

The  the absurdity 

2

aspect comes down to the  perhaps the prosecution in 

3

this case, and I didn't mean to overstate that, Justice 

4

Kagan.  The fact is, is that throwing it overboard, the 

5

log, the picture that memorializes what that fish looked 

6

like at the time is a record, and it would fall within 

7

it. 

8
9
10
11
12
13

 And taking a step back to Justice Breyer's 
question earlier 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Wouldn't it be just as 

absurd to give him 20 years, though, wouldn't it? 
 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It would be extremely 

absurd, Justice Scalia. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  I don't understand. 
But that clearly falls 

16

within the statute.  I mean, you can't argue that it 

17

doesn't.  So 

18
19
20

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

The only  the only way 

we could argue 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You know, it seems as though 

21

this is  Congress gives very strict penalties to lots 

22

of minor things, and  but that's, you know, that's 

23

what it does. 

24
25

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Congress did something 

that was very, very strong language to the American

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

people in the SarbanesOxley Act.  It added 1519 to 

2

cover recordrelated matters, 20 years.  1512(c) is 

3

related to official proceedings  we've discussed that 

4

earlier  20 years.  It upped wire fraud, mail fraud, 

5

from 5 years all the way up to 20 years.  Why did 

6

Congress do that?  It did that because it recognized the 

7

harm that Enron/Arthur Andersen type of situations did 

8

to the financial wellbeing of this country and the 

9

investors in public markets, and it wanted to send a 

10

message to the public to not engage in record 

11

destruction that could impede or influence the proper 

12

administration of any matter.  That's why it's important 

13

to limit the subject matter of this particular statute 

14

to just recordrelated matters. 

15

 If there are no more questions, I would like 

16

to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, 

17

Mr. Chief.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ

22
23
24
25

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Section 1519's key phrase, "any record, 
document, or tangible object," unambiguously encompasses

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all types of physical evidence.  That's clear from the 

2

standard meaning of those words in ordinary speech and 

3

from the broader statutory and historical context in 

4

which those words appear. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Why are those  why 

6

are those the key words?  Why don't you start earlier? 

7

"Knowingly alter, destroy, mutilate, conceal, cover up, 

8

falsify, "those are certainly pertinent in analyzing the 

9

reach of "tangible object," aren't they? 

10

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think they show that 

11

that Congress was intending to essentially figure out 

12

every way that  that someone might imagine tampering 

13

with or destroying or  or obstructing justice by 

14

getting rid of evidence, and so they might shed light on 

15

it.  But the issue in this case is the meaning of  of 

16

the phrase "any tangible object." 

17

 I would like to 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Are you  are you then 

19

saying that this is, indeed, a general statute against 

20

destroying anything that would impede a Federal 

21

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

We think this is a general 

22

statute that would cover destroying any record, 

23

document, or tangible object, which we think, as a 

24

manner of plain meaning and history covers all types 

25

of  of physical evidence.

25

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Assume that Congress 

2

intended and wanted, to cure a void in the criminal 

3

statutes, to have a general prohibition against 

4

destruction of evidence and that it put it in 

5

SarbanesOxley, and you make that argument.  Are there 

6

any other laws of general application that were also 

7

included in the Sarbanes Act  Oxley, or is this the 

8

only one? 

9

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

No, there  there were a 

10

number.  First of all, Petitioner has conceded that 

11

1512(c)(1) itself is of general application.  The other 

12

one that I think is the clearest to point to would be 

13

1513(e), which was a new provision also added as part of 

14

SarbanesOxley that was the antiretaliation provision. 

15

And 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is there any other 

17

provision of Federal law that has a lesser penalty than 

18

20 years that could have been applied to this  this 

19

captain throwing a fish overboard? 

20

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Well, Your Honor, he was 

21

convicted of violating 2232.  The statute that 

22

Petitioner agreed he could have been charged with, 

23

1512(c)(1), also applies a 20year penalty. 

24

 But I'd like to address 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And that's it?

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

They never meant to 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There is nothing lesser 

3
4

than that? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

5

may have been other 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I'm sure there  there 

You know, frankly, you come 

7

here, and, yeah, he only got  what did he get, 30 days 

8

or something? 

9
10
11

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But he could have gotten 

20 years.  What kind of a sensible prosecution is that? 

12

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Your Honor 
Is there nothing else 

14

you  who  who do you have out there that  that 

15

exercises prosecutorial discretion?  Is this the same 

16

guy that  that brought the prosecution in Bond last 

17

term? 

18

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, I think a couple 

19

points on that.  First of all, Congress passed a broad 

20

statute.  The statute as originally drafted and reported 

21

out of the Senate Judiciary Committee had a 5year 

22

penalty.  Congress looked very closely at that penalty. 

23

It was  sorry, it was drafted with 5 years.  It was 

24

reported out of committee with 10 years, and it was 

25

ultimately at  at the suggestion of the House of

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Representatives, upped to 20 years. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, I'm not talking about 

3

Congress.  I'm talking about the prosecutor.  What kind 

4

of a mad prosecutor would try to send this guy up for 

5

20 years or risk sending him up for 20 years? 

6

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, we did not ask 

7

for 20 years in this prosecution.  And let me try to 

8

explain 

9
10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you did  you did 

you did charge 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What did you ask for? 
You charged two offenses: 

13

2232, and Yates is not questioning the applicability of 

14

that.  Is there any guidance that comes from Justice to 

15

prosecutors?  I mean, the code is filled with 

16

overlapping offenses.  So here's a case where the one 

17

statute has a 5year maximum, the other 20.  The one 

18

that has the 5year clearly covers the situation. 

19

 Is there anything in any kind of manual in 

20

the Department of Justice that instructs U.S. attorneys 

21

what to do when there are these overlapping statutes? 

22

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, the  my 

23

understanding of the U.S. Attorney's Manual is that the 

24

general guidance that's given is that the prosecutor 

25

should charge  once the decision is made to bring a

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

criminal prosecution, the prosecutor should charge 

2

the  the offense that's the most severe under the law. 

3

That's not a hard and fast rule, but that's kind of the 

4

default principle.  In this case that was Section 1519. 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, if that's going to be 

6

the Justice Department's position, then we're going to 

7

have to be much more careful about how extensive 

8

statutes are.  I mean, if you're saying we're always 

9

going to prosecute the most severe, I'm going to be very 

10

careful about how severe I make statutes. 

11

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

I give to severe statutes. 

14

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, that's 
Or  or how much coverage 

That's  that's not what we 

15

were saying.  I think we're not always going to 

16

prosecute every case, and obviously we're going to 

17

exercise our discretion.  In this case, what the 

18

prosecutors did was they looked at the circumstances of 

19

the offense.  And just to emphasize what happened here, 

20

Mr. Yates was given an explicit instruction by a law 

21

enforcement officer to preserve evidence of his 

22

violation of Federal law.  He directly disobeyed that. 

23

He then launched a  a convoluted coverup scheme to 

24

to cover up the fact that he had destroyed the evidence. 

25

He enlisted other people, including his crew members, in

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

executing that scheme and in lying to the law 

2

enforcement officers about it.  And then 

3
4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

like a mob boss or something.  I mean, he was caught 

5

 (Laughter.) 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

7
8
9

You make him sound 

The fish were  how 

many inches short of permitted were the fish? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

The fish were  it varied 

fish by fish, Your Honor. 

10

 (Laughter.) 

11

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

But we did not  the 

12

prosecution in this case was not about the size of the 

13

fish.  The prosecution was about the destruction of the 

14

evidence, and I think it would be a very strange thing 

15

if this Court were to say that the obstruction of 

16

justice law is somehow applied differently when the 

17

offense is trivial. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Did you ask  did you ask 

for or recommend a particular sentence? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

We asked for a sentence 

21

within the guidelines range which was  which was 

22

calculated by the judge at I think 21 to 27 months.  The 

23

judge ended up giving 30 days.  We did not appeal that. 

24

We think, you know, that was a reasonable exercise of 

25

the judge's discretion, which I think is a very

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

important check on the fact that this is, of course, a 

2

very broad statute, and I think a 20year penalty, of 

3

course, would  would have been too  too much in this 

4

circumstance. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But according 
Go ahead. 
But according  if 

8

I understand your answer to Justice Scalia, according to 

9

the Justice Department manual, any case in which someone 

10

destroys a tangible object, you  you should prosecute 

11

them under this statute, because I assume 20 years is 

12

the maximum available penalty? 

13

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, we would not 

14

we do not prosecute every fish disposal case, and  we 

15

do not.  So I think if you 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But the point is 

17

that you could, and the point is that once you can, 

18

every time you get somebody who is throwing fish 

19

overboard, you can go to him and say:  Look, if we 

20

prosecute you you're facing 20 years, so why don't you 

21

plead to a year, or something like that.  It's an 

22

extraordinary leverage that the broadest interpretation 

23

of this statute would give Federal prosecutors. 

24
25

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, we're operating 

with the  with the statute that Congress passed, and

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress decided that this statute was going to carry a 

2

20year penalty.  And I think the issue in this case, 

3

though, is whether Mr. Yates' conduct comes within the 

4

terms of that statute and specifically whether a fish 

5

counts as a tangible object. 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER:

7

normal obstruction of justice statute that existed 

8

before this?

criminal matter?

catching fish that are too small?  Am I right?

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's a civil offense. 
Yes. 
Fine.  Then isn't there a

statute that says that you cannot destroy evidence

to be?

3

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Yes, and it's 1519 and only

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

In other words, for many,

5

could not prosecute obstruction of justice.

Your Honor, the 
Where there was a civil 

offense involved? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

When there was a  in the 

10

absence of a pending judicial proceeding, the government 

11

could not have prosecuted him under 1503. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, I'm not asking specific 

13

things.  I want to know the general criminal law, which 

14

I do not know all of it.  I had always thought there is 

15

a crime called obstruction of justice, and I always 

16

thought that a person who destroys evidence, where he 

17

knows it's evidence, he's been asked to bring it to the 

18

proceeding which may not yet have taken place, he 

19

purposely destroys it, I had thought that that was a 

20

crime. 

21

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

22

for that to be a crime 

23
24
25

It would make perfect sense 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But it was never was in the 

criminal system?  No one was ever prosecuted for it? 
 MR. MARTINEZ:

I'm sorry 
 in the wake of Enron. 
I'm sorry, but 
What statute did you used 

to use? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Well, in the Arthur Andersen 

prosecution they used 1512(b)(2).  But the problem with 

10

1512(b)(2) was that it had a huge loophole in it. 

11

1512(b)(2) prohibited person A from persuading person B 

12

to destroy evidence, but it didn't prohibit person A 

13

from destroying that exact same evidence himself.  And 

14

so Congress decided 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay, okay.  I guess I can 

16

look that up later.  But in any case, this is a  what 

17

will you do with the problem that I put together?  That 

18

is my problem.

vagueness problem?  Is that what

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Yeah. 
I think there are certain 

23

questions that come into play with this statute, which 

24

are arguably vague, and they don't have to do with the 

25

meaning of tangible object.  They have to do with the 

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the various intentrelated elements of the statute.  For 

2

example, what does it mean to impede, obstruct or 

3

influence justice?  What does it mean to be acting in 

4

contemplation of a proceeding, and do you need to know 

5

that the proceeding is  is under Federal jurisdiction? 

6

Those are the kinds of questions that the lower courts 

7

are currently dealing with.  They're not presented in 

8

this case. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, I know.  It's not just 

10

influence a proceeding.  It is, for example  and here 

11

it's obscure, but it means to destroy something in 

12

relation to any such matter or case.  What matter?  In 

13

relation to any matter within the jurisdiction of any 

14

department or agency within the United States.  What? 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean, somebody comes to 

17

the door and says  I've been through this.  He passes 

18

a piece of paper through the door.  It's the postal 

19

it's a postman.  He says, please send this back.  It's 

20

our proper duty to deliver the mail.  I say, I hate 

21

postmen and I rip it up.  20 years. 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

24
25

Your Honor, that would not be 

covered. 
 (Laughter.)

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And why wouldn't it happen? 

2

It wouldn't happen because you'd never prosecute it, 

3

though I've had my doubts recently. 

4

 (Laughter.) 

5

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, it wouldn't 

6

happen because the statute requires bad intent.  It 

7

requires the intent to impede, obstruct 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, I do.  I say, I hate 

9

postmen.  I don't want them to find out.  And I tell 

10

four people, I finally got even with the postman.  I 

11

have  I have the intent. 

12

 And I'm using a ridiculous example purposely 

13

because, by using an example purposely, I'm trying to 

14

get you to focus on the question of how possibly to draw 

15

a line.  And if you can't draw a line, it seems to me 

16

that the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory 

17

enforcement is a real one.  And if that's a real risk, 

18

you fall within the vagueness doctrine.  There is the 

19

whole problem spelled out, and what I do not understand 

20

is the relation of this case to that doctrine or how to 

21

decide this case. 

22

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, this case is 

23

is not related to that doctrine because the Petitioner 

24

has not made a vagueness argument. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

What this Court has said is 

2

that when  when vagueness challenge is represented, 

3

they need to be presented in asapplied challenges. 

4

That hasn't happened in this case, and so 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

How do I know since there 

6

could be four ways of trying to limit it?  And one way 

7

to try to limit it might be what your opponent says. 

8
9

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think that his way is a 

particularly bad way to address the problem that you 

10

the exact hypothetical that you gave me because in that 

11

case, we're talking about a document, a letter, that the 

12

postman hands over.  And so the problem that  that 

13

your  your hypothetical poses is not addressed by the 

14

solution he gives. 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

That's true. 
So there's a total mismatch. 

17

And I don't think there's any reason to think that 

18

Congress, even if it had concerns about breadth, would 

19

have wanted to solve those concerns by  by narrowing, 

20

in a very unnatural fashion, the word "tangible object," 

21

whereas, you know, leaving in place the terms "record 

22

and document." 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Martinez, can we go 

24

back to what we started with  with what Justice Breyer 

25

started with?  If I understood your brief right, up

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

until 1519, the general obstruction statute, 1503, 

2

applied only to the destruction of evidence in a 

3

judicial proceeding if you got someone else to destroy 

4

it. 

5

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

1503 applied only to pending 

6

judicial proceedings.  There was a different provision, 

7

Section 1512(b)(2) that, as  as the Court considered 

8

and addressed in the Arthur Andersen prosecution, 1512 

9

(b)(2) did not prohibit  single act or destruction. 

10
11

You had to persuade someone else. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Okay.  So you needed 

12

something to punish people who destroyed evidence and 

13

but I see two provisions, 1519 and 1512.  Are they 

14

superfluous? 

15

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think the way to understand 

16

those provisions is to  is to understand the fact 

17

that, one, they are super  they are redundant largely, 

18

not entirely; and, two, why are they both in there? 

19

It's a very reasonable question to ask.  And the reason 

20

is, these were rival  essentially rival provisions, 

21

they were drafted by different people at different times 

22

and they both ended up in the statute by the way that 

23

the 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that makes it okay. 

That's fine.  I mean, you know, that explains how it

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

happens.  It doesn't explain how it makes any sense. 

2

 (Laughter.) 

3

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Well, Your Honor, I think to 

4

address the  the textual component of the superfluous 

5

nature of those two provisions, I think it's unambiguous 

6

that they are superfluous, and I think Petitioner would 

7

agree with us that they're superfluous with respect to 

8

records and documents.  So we know here that Congress 

9

was not intending to avoid surplusage.  The only 

10

question is whether they also  they  they thought it 

11

would be superfluous with the third term in the list, 

12

which is either "other objects" or "tangible objects." 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, not only that, 

14

1519  1512 only applies for use in an official 

15

proceeding; isn't  isn't that right? 

16

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's right.  It's narrower. 
Yes.  And this applies to 

18

any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or 

19

agency of the United States.  Is the knowingly 

20

requirement of 1519, does that apply to that portion of 

21

the statute or does it only apply to altering, 

22

destroying, mutilating, concealing, covering up, or 

23

falsifying? 

24
25

 Do you have to know that it is within the 
jurisdiction of a  of a Federal agency?

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

No, you don't.  It's a 

2

jurisdictional element that typically that it  as this 

3

Court has read other statutes, the  the knowledge 

4

requirement does not extend to the jurisdictional 

5

element. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Wow.  Then it's really 
Your Honor, but that's  the 

8

court of appeals have said that if this Court has 

9

concerns with that  that holding, I think there may be 

10

a different case in which to bring that up.  Here, of 

11

course, Mr. Yates had perfect knowledge that there was a 

12

Federal proceeding that was ongoing and so that concern 

13

doesn't affect his case. 

14
15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
problem. 

16

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18
19

In this case, it's not a 

But  can I 
1512, could you have 

charged it? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

1512(c)(1), I think we could 

20

have charged it, yes, Your Honor.  And we didn't  and 

21

I think in the Eleventh Circuit there was some confusion 

22

about how you deal with investigations and whether 

23

investigations that are probably going to give rise to a 

24

proceeding, whether that kind of is close enough to an 

25

official proceeding to charge 1512(c)(1), so they made

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the decision to charge 1519 instead.  It was  it was a 

2

reasonable decision based on the language of the 

3

statute. 

4

 But I want to emphasize, I think the most 

5

important thing that Petitioner's counsel conceded here 

6

today was that 1512(c)(1) is a general obstruction of 

7

justice statute that was passed as part of 

8

SarbanesOxley and covers the destruction of fish.  And 

9

I think that 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

He said it has a stronger 

state of mind element. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

It's  the requirement is a 

13

little bit more rigorous with respect to 1512(c)(1). 

14

But I think the key point is SarbanesOxley prohibits 

15

the destruction of fish.  You said that, that's been our 

16

position, and I think that undermines the whole theme of 

17

his brief and certainly the theme of all the amicus 

18

amicus briefs that's been  that have been filed here. 

19

 Their whole point has been it's impossible 

20

to imagine that  that Sarbanes  that Congress could 

21

have wanted SarbanesOxley, an Enronrelated statute, to 

22

prohibit the destruction of fish, and yet that's the 

23

point on which we all agree here today. 

24
25

 I'd like to say a few words about the 
various textual arguments that  that Petitioner has

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

put forward, the nouns, the verbs and the headings. 

2

First of all, with respect to  with respect to the 

3

nouns, I think the historical evidence that we've put 

4

forward, I think, show conclusively that the term 

5

"record," "document," and "tangible things" is very, 

6

very similar to the standard formulation that 

7

essentially everyone has used to cover all physical 

8

evidence in the obstruction of justice context for over 

9

five decades. 

10
11
12

 Secondly, 1512(c)(1) confirms that the 
the 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Could  could you tell me, 

13

Mr. Martinez, where are those other provisions?  I  I 

14

think that there are about five of them in 1512.  I take 

15

it there are many State statutes, are there?  Are there 

16

other Federal statutes? 

17

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

We  the  the key 

18

provisions that we've pointed to in our brief, there's 

19

six different provisions of Section 1512.  1512 

20

(a)(1)(b), (a)(2)(b)(1). 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

22

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

That's okay. 
Okay.  So there's six in 

23

1512.  There's 16 different State provisions that have 

24

essentially the same language.  I think most of them say 

25

"record," "document" or "thing."  Some of them say

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

"record," "document" or "other object." 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but  when 

3

you say this  I understood your friend to say 

4

"tangible object" is only used in record statutes.  In 

5

1512 

6

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No. 
 it's  it's 

8

"object," I mean tangible  yeah, "tangible thing."  In 

9

1512 it's "object," right? 

10

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

In 1512 it's "other object." 
Well, see, the 

12

reason  I mean, maybe that makes a difference if you 

13

have records, documents, and then a tangible object 

14

suggests that the tangible nature of it is what's 

15

significant, which suggests that it may be one of the 

16

you know, whatever the drive thing is as opposed to a 

17

record.  And that's a point that's not present in the 

18

statutes that you were citing. 

19

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think  I think it's true 

20

that the term "tangible" is different.  I think that the 

21

way to understand the term "tangible" is the way in 

22

which Congress and  and the rules always use the term 

23

"tangible" in connection with things or objects, which 

24

is as a way to refer to all types of  of objects, all 

25

types of evidence.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 We've cited 35 different provisions of the 

2

U.S. Code and of the  the discovery rules in the 

3

criminal context and in the civil context.  Those are at 

4

Footnote 3 of our brief.  In all of those instances, 

5

they use the phrase "tangible things" or "tangible 

6

object" to refer to everything.  And so there's no 

7

reason to think that the addition of the word "tangible" 

8

somehow shrunk the scope of the statute.  And even if it 

9

did shrink 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is there such a thing as an 

intangible object?  I'm trying to imagine one. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I  I think the  you could 

13

say that the object of the game of Monopoly is to win 

14

all the money, but that's not really what Congress was 

15

looking at here. 

16

 (Laughter.) 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Object not meaning purpose. 
I  I don't think that the 

19

word  I agree with what Petitioner said in his opening 

20

brief, which is that  that the word "tangible" here 

21

doesn't really do much.  He said that at page 13 of his 

22

opening brief.  When you get to his reply brief, 

23

suddenly the word "tangible" is doing all this amazing 

24

work that  and it's the key difference between this 

25

statute and all the other statutes.  So that's with

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

respect 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You, in your brief, point 

3

to the Model Penal Code as the model for 1519.  But the 

4

Model Penal Code describes a misdemeanor, and this is a 

5

20year felony.  That seems kind of a mismatch. 

6

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

You know, if  the tradition 

7

of  of the degree of penalty to attach to this offense 

8

has changed over time.  As you point out, the Model 

9

Penal Code did identify this as a misdemeanor.  The 

10

Brown Commission, which built on the Model Penal Code, 

11

treated it as a misdemeanor or as a felony, depending on 

12

the severity of the underlying offense. 

13

 When Congress sat down in the '70s and '80s 

14

and was trying to incorporate, essentially, that 

15

provision into Federal law unsuccessfully, over a dozen 

16

times it treated it as a felony.  And then, or course, 

17

Congress in SarbanesOxley Act in both 1512(c)(1) and in 

18

1519 also treated it as a felony with a 20year penalty. 

19

And  and with respect to that penalty, again, I think 

20

it's important to emphasize that the text that's at 

21

issue here, any tangible object, that was fixed and that 

22

was drafted  it was in the bill that was introduced by 

23

Senator Leahy at the time when it was only a 5year 

24

penalty.  And there's no reason to think that when 

25

Congress tinkered with that penalty, it meant to kind

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of, by implication, shrink the scope of tangible objects 

2

that's at issue here. 

3

 And I think just to emphasize the  the 

4

textual point, it's  it's a very unusual and I think 

5

it's  it's highly implausible to believe that Congress 

6

chose this broad and expansive phrase, "any tangible 

7

object," when really what it really wanted to do was 

8

refer only to a very narrow and specific category of 

9

information storage devices. 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, isn't that 

11

like the Bond decision?  I mean, you had text that could 

12

be read broadly, and yet we suggested, well, Congress 

13

could not have meant the Chemical Weapons Treaty to 

14

cover a minor dusting of  with toxic, irritating 

15

chemicals. 

16

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think Bond it's  I think 

17

Bond is actually in some ways helpful to the government 

18

in this case.  Because as I understand the  the Bond 

19

decision, it turned essentially on the everyday meaning 

20

of  of the phrase and of  and Federalism concerns as 

21

well.  And the everyday meaning of the phrase  I think 

22

it was "chemical weapon" in that case  didn't apply 

23

to  to the chemicals at issue that Miss Bond used. 

24

 But in this case, the everyday meaning of 

25

the phrase "tangible object" applies to all tangible

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

objects.  Everyone  and if you stop someone on the 

2

street and ask them is a fish a tangible object, the 

3

answer would almost certainly be  would be yes.  And 

4

so, you don't have as well what you had in Bond, which 

5

was the concern about  about Federalism and the 

6

application of that canon. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what if you 

8

stopped them on the street and said is a fish record 

9

document or tangible object? 

10

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think if you  if you 

11

asked them that question and you  you pointed them to 

12

the fact that 

13
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't think you would get 

a polite answer to either of those questions. 

15

 (Laughter). 

16

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, maybe I could say 

17

a word  having talked about the nouns, maybe I could 

18

say a word about the verbs in this statute because they 

19

make a  they place a lot of emphasis on the "makes a 

20

false entry" language.  Petitioner's argument rests on 

21

this premise that each of the verbs has to work with 

22

with each of the nouns, but that premise is  is 

23

flawed.  It's not consistent with how Congress drafts 

24

statutes, it's not consistent with Petitioner's own 

25

interpretation, and I think there's significant tension

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with this Court's decision last year in Roberts.  Let me 

2

say a word about each. 

3

 With respect to how Congress drafts 

4

statutes, I think you only have to look to Section 1505 

5

of the statute to see that that's yet another example of 

6

where Congress has used  had a bunch of verbs and a 

7

bunch of nouns and some of the nouns don't work with 

8

some of the verbs.  You can't mutilate oral testimony. 

9

With respect to Petitioner, the inconsistency with 

10

Petitioner's own theory, Petitioner agrees that 1519 

11

covers the destruction of an email in electronic form. 

12

You can't mutilate an email.  No one would ever talk 

13

like that. 

14

 Similarly, he says that it would apply to a 

15

blank hard drive.  But no one  I've never heard anyone 

16

talk about falsifying a blank hard drive.  So the 

17

implications of his argument are inconsistent with 

18

with where he wants the Court to go.  And then finally, 

19

the Roberts case.  Roberts dealt with a circumstance, it 

20

wasn't perfectly analogous, but it was  it raised a 

21

similar problem, which is that there was a broad 

22

statute, it had many different applications, and there 

23

was some language in the statute that was a little bit 

24

awkward and a little bit superfluous with regard to some 

25

of the applications of the statute.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And the response that the Court had to that 

2

problem was not to say, well, the statute doesn't apply 

3

to those circumstances.  The response was to say that 

4

that's the linguistic price to be paid, linguistic price 

5

to be paid for having a broad statute.  And then the 

6

Court said Congress does not need to write extra 

7

language specifically exempting, phrase by phrase, 

8

applications with respect to which a portion of a phrase 

9

is not needed.  I think that was right in Roberts and I 

10
11

think the same principle applies here. 
 Finally, Your Honor, with respect to the 

12

headings, a couple points.  First, I think the headings 

13

in this case as in  as in the Lawson case that this 

14

Court also dealt with last term also involving 

15

SarbanesOxley, the headings here are just obviously and 

16

unambiguously under inclusive.  The heading is a 

17

shorthand reference to the general subject matter.  It's 

18

not intended to spell out what the operative provisions 

19

say or to mirror those operative provisions.  It's 

20

obviously under inclusive.  It omits a whole bunch of 

21

the verbs.  It omits two of the nouns.  The heading 

22

argument, I think, is especially unreliable in this 

23

context where if you look at what Congress did with 

24

SarbanesOxley generally, it was not paying very close 

25

attention to the headings under which it put various

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

provisions. 
 That's true with respect to 1519, that's 

3

true with respect to 1514, the statute that was at issue 

4

in the Lawson case, and it's also true with respect to 

5

Section 1512(c)(1).  Section 1512(c)(1) prohibits me 

6

from  prohibits any person from destroying evidence. 

7

But they put that  that provision inside the 

8

witnesstampering statute.  It doesn't make sense; it 

9

doesn't fit there.  And that just shows that Congress 

10

was not paying close attention to the headings and that 

11

that shouldn't drive the outcome of this case. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, Mr. Martinez, you are 

13

really  I mean, you have arguments on all of these 

14

points, but you are really asking the Court to swallow 

15

something that is pretty hard to swallow.  Do you deny 

16

that this statute, as you read it, is capable of being 

17

applied to really trivial matters, and yet each of those 

18

would carry a potential penalty of 20 years, and then 

19

you go further and say that it is the policy of the 

20

Justice Department that this has to be applied in every 

21

one of those crazy little cases.  And this involved a 

22

business and a number of fish.  What if it was one fish? 

23

What if it was one undersized fish that was caught by a 

24

fisherman in a national  on Federal land?  This would 

25

be  would it apply here?

50

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, I want to answer 

2

that question, but I just want to clarify what I said 

3

about our policy.  Our policy is not that we prosecute 

4

every trivial matter.  That is not our policy.  I want 

5

to be very clear about that. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, I understand that.  But 

7

if you choose to  if you want to find the guy who 

8

caught one trout that was undersized on Federal  on a 

9

Federal  on Federal land, you want to charge him with 

10

whatever regulatory offense that would be, you have to 

11

charge this, too, because this is the more severe 

12

penalty. 

13

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

We only have to charge this 

14

if  if the person with knowledge and the intent to 

15

obstruct the administration of Federal law deliberately 

16

takes that one fish and throws it overboard or destroys 

17

it so as to escape liability. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

That's what the statute says. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

He catches the fish and now 

What about every camper 

21

he sees the inspector coming toward him, throws it in 

22

the lake. 

23

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

That's what the statute says, 

24

Your Honor.  Now, I  I appreciate the force of the 

25

hypothetical and I understand it, but I think I want

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to  the point I want to emphasize, because maybe 

2

there's  I understand why the Court might have 

3

concerns about that.  The problem  there's a mismatch, 

4

though, between Petitioner's argument and the 

5

hypothetical. 

6

 The problem with the hypothetical is that 

7

this statute might be harsh in certain particular 

8

outlier applications.  But Petitioner is not arguing for 

9

some sort of de minimis rule, he's not saying that this 

10

statute can't be applied in trivial cases.  He's arguing 

11

that an entire class of evidence is entirely outside the 

12

scope of the statute 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But he has no  he has no 

14

doctrinal basis to make that argument other than to say 

15

that there is such a doctrine as prosecutorial 

16

discretion and, A, that it's enforceable and, B, that it 

17

has some substance, and you've indicated that it has 

18

neither. 

19

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I  I think, Your Honor, I 

20

don't think that  I think prosecutorial discretion is 

21

not an issue that he's raised.  I don't think that it's 

22

an issue in light of this Court  what this Court has 

23

said about prosecutorial discretion.  I don't think that 

24

would be a basis 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, it seems to me that

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we should just not use the concept or refer to the 

2

concept at all anymore. 

3

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Well, Your Honor, I think 

4

that  that  again, to go back to some of the answers 

5

I was  I was giving earlier, I think that the concerns 

6

that the Court has flagged about the potential breadth 

7

of this statute, they're serious and they're the kinds 

8

of concerns that courts and juries and judges are going 

9

to take into consideration when they're dealing with any 

10

of these crimes.  But the issue in this case is not 

11

is not that.  The issue in this case is what is  what 

12

did Congress intend with the term "any tangible object." 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  So if that's 

14

so, then that's the dilemma.  Suppose I worry about 

15

Justice Alito's single fish in the case of a camper who 

16

kicks an ember away, knowing you shouldn't have built 

17

the campfire or picks a flower, knowing you're supposed 

18

to let wildflowers blossom.  What about that 20 years, 

19

and you could multiply those beyond belief.  So if 

20

that's the problem, does his client go to prison because 

21

we've just assumed that problem away from the case? 

22

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, we do not 
How  how do we handle it 

24

if, as you say, there is a genuine concern in that 

25

respect, but it wasn't argued here?

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think that you write a very 

2

narrow decision that says this case is about the meaning 

3

of the term "any tangible object."  And if the case 

4

the ember case comes up or the postman case comes up, 

5

then  and if the arguments are made, then I think 

6

those arguments can be fleshed out, they can be briefed, 

7

they can be thought through by the parties, and I think 

8

they'll be properly presented to the Court in that case. 

9

 In this case, though, this case presents 

10

just a common sense, straightforward question of 

11

statutory interpretation.  Does the phrase "any tangible 

12

object" actually mean what Congress said?  Does it refer 

13

to all tangible objects?  We think that the unambiguous 

14

answer based on the text of the statute, based on the 

15

history of the statute, is  is clearly yes, and we ask 

16

this Court to affirm. 

17
18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Perhaps Congress should 

have called this the SarbanesOxley Grouper Act.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. BADALAMENTI 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

I'll be brief.  Regarding 

2

Justice Breyer's question regarding the void for 

3

vagueness, the government stated that we had not stated 

4

that in our brief.  It's on pages 25 and 26, as well as 

5

squarely raised in Footnote 7. 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, but it wasn't raised 

7

below.  And these are very difficult issues and it's 

8

sort of flying blind not to have lower court opinions 

9

and the thing fully argued out before we get it. 

10

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

Yes, Your Honor.  We just 

11

wanted to point out where it was in the briefing in 

12

this  in this Court. 

13

 The "tangible object" notion is extremely 

14

important, which the justices have pointed out under 

15

Russello.  You have the fact that you have two statutes 

16

passed in the same act.  One includes different language 

17

than the other.  To presume that that language is 

18

included in there intentionally and that major 

19

significance makes false entry in all of the statutes 

20

that are  we've cited in our brief in Footnote 4, that 

21

reference of the reply brief  all of them are 

22

recordrelated statutes.  Every single one of them has a 

23

textural indication of what Congress had meant. 

24
25

 The breadth of the statute regarding any 
Federal matter is  is an extraordinary thing that the

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

American people will be walking on eggshells for if this 

2

Court were to not limit, at least, the subject matter of 

3

this.  And the last point 

4
5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course, it doesn't 

entirely solve that problem, simply to narrow 

6

 MR. BADALAMENTI: 

It does not  it doesn't, 

7

Your Honor.  And Mr. Yates would open up any other 

8

constitutional issues as well.  But no, certainly the 

9

last comment is directed  is that for more than 200 

10

years, the United States has existed without this mega, 

11

allinclusive obstruction of justice statute with the 

12

intent to impede anything, any matter, that the 

13

possibility of the United States could or may or may 

14

never be interested in.  It didn't create it buried 

15

within the SarbanesOxley Act and this Court shouldn't 

16

put it in there now. 

17

 For these reasons, Mr. Yates requests that 

18

this Court vacate the conviction under Section 1519, 

19

reverse, remand the decision to the Eleventh Circuit. 

20

 Thank you. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

Thank you, counsel. 

The case is submitted. 

23

 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the 

24

aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
