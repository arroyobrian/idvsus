 (10:03 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

first this morning in Case 12315, Air Wisconsin 

5

Airlines v. Hoeper. 

6

 Mr. Cohn. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. COHN 

8
9
10
11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. COHN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Not even Mr. Hoeper can defend the decision 

12

below and for good reason.  Under the plain terms of the 

13

statute and consistent with this Court's First Amendment 

14

precedence, truth matters, and airlines should not lose 

15

their ATSA immunity, unless their statements are 

16

materially false.  None of that is in dispute anymore. 

17

 Also not in dispute, I think, is that Air 

18

Wisconsin was justified in picking up the phone, calling 

19

TSA, and conveying certain core facts; namely, that 

20

Mr. Hoeper was mad at the airline; that he was a Federal 

21

flight deck officer or FFDO; that he had walked out on 

22

his training, his last chance to keep his job; and he 

23

was about to board a plane.  I don't believe any of 

24

those facts are in dispute. 

25

 What is in dispute is how those facts were

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

framed or phrased to TSA in that call.  How the report 

2

was packaged and did 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm  I'm not sure it 

4

you said it is conceded that  that those things should 

5

have been brought to the airline's attention.  Has that 

6

been conceded?  I'm not sure. 

7

 MR. COHN: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

I think they conceded
I think  I think they 

said if it  if they were brought, they should have 

10

been brought in a different fashion, but I'm not  I'm 

11

not sure they  they have conceded that. 

12

 MR. COHN: 

I believe they have conceded, 

13

Justice Scalia, that those facts could have been 

14

conveyed, justifiably.  If we had conveyed those core 

15

facts using different words, there would not be any 

16

issue here. 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you could convey 

anything justifiably, sure, I agree with that. 
 MR. COHN: 

And the question, Justice Scalia, 

20

is whether we framed or phrased the report in an 

21

adequate manner.  And in assessing that issue, the 

22

question comes down to how much breathing space airlines 

23

should be given in making these reports, how much room 

24

there should be for permissible characterization and 

25

expression in making these reports.  And context should

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be kept in mind in answering that question, three things 

2

in particular. 

3

 First, these reports are being made by 

4

airline employees, such as pilots and flight attendants 

5

and baggage handlers and ticket agents, who are being 

6

told by TSA they have to report in realtime, without 

7

investigation, without calling their lawyer, without 

8

stopping to think on how to refine the perfect script, 

9

and they are being told to do this based upon their 

10

suspicions, in some cases, suspicions of other people's 

11

emotions or state of mind.  That's one critical piece of 

12

context. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, Mr. Cohn, on the 
Can  can we go back to 

15

your response to Justice Scalia?  You said that the 

16

Respondents conceded, but  but isn't it the case that 

17

it was the Colorado supreme court that said that the 

18

airline likely would have been immune if they had 

19

phrased the report more cautiously? 

20

 MR. COHN: 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

22
23

That's exactly right, Justice 
So it's  it's the 

Colorado supreme court, not the Respondent? 
 MR. COHN: 

Well, I believe the Respondents 

24

have also acknowledged that a call could have been made 

25

conveying a certain fact.  You're completely correct,

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Ginsburg, that the Colorado supreme court said 

2

we'd be likely immune if only we had used different 

3

words, and those different words are immaterial.  That 

4

lower court engaged in hairsplitting 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You had  you're 

6

saying  you're saying there were three critical facts. 

7

One is that these reports have to be made on suspicions 

8

right away in realtime, by people like baggage handlers. 

9

And your second point was? 

10

 MR. COHN: 

The second point of context is 

11

that these reports are being made to TSA and other 

12

reasonable air safety officials, for the purpose of 

13

passenger safety and aviation security.  And TSA tells 

14

the airlines, if you have any doubt, report; if you see 

15

something, say something.  And if you don't say 

16

something 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And then the third?  And 

your third? 
 MR. COHN: 

And the third piece of context is 

20

the consequences of a failure to make a report can be 

21

catastrophic for passenger safety and aviation security. 

22

And that's why TSA says, if you don't report 

23

sincerelyheld concerns, you might be sanctioned by us 

24

for failing to make the report, placing airlines between 

25

a rock and a hard place.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

In this context, it's not 

2

clear to me what the issue is that's before us.  My 

3

understanding is, is that there was no finding of 

4

falsity.  Now, the jury was instructed that it had to be 

5

defamatory.  Lawyers know that that means it has to be 

6

false, I assume.  And are you saying that  you know, 

7

the jurors weren't instructed as to the definition of 

8

"defamatory"?  Is that the point? 

9

 MR. COHN: 

No, the issue is not about the 

10

jury instructions, Justice Kennedy.  The question's 

11

about the statutory immunity and the Aviation 

12

Transportation Security Act, ATSA, and whether that 

13

immunity requires a determination of whether or not the 

14

statement was materially false. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

16

 MR. COHN: 

17
18

By the court. 
By the court in our view.  We 

think, under any standard, we should prevail. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What  what position 

19

although they'll tell us in a minute  does Respondent 

20

take on that issue that a determination by the jury 

21

suffices?  As you understand their brief.  They can talk 

22

for themselves in a few minutes. 

23

 MR. COHN: 

I believe two things.  One, I 

24

believe they concede the legal question that material 

25

falsity is part of the ATSA analysis, and that's the

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question on which this Court granted cert.  On the 

2

second question, which is not before the Court, is who 

3

should decide this issue, the court or the jury? 

4

 I believe they feel the jury should answer 

5

that question.  Again, that issue is not strictly before 

6

the Court, but I think, on the issue that is before the 

7

Court, they agree that material falsity is part of the 

8

ATSA analysis. 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But isn't that implicit in 

10

the instruction to the jury, that it has to be 

11

defamatory?  Now, if you say, well, even if it is, the 

12

judge  the court has a duty to determine, as a matter 

13

of law, at the outset, then that's something else. 

14

 MR. COHN: 

Well, the jury  and this is a 

15

question of the jury instructions, which are not being 

16

challenged, are not before the Court, but the jury was 

17

not given instruction on materiality. 

18

 The jury, also, was not given instruction on 

19

clear and convincing.  They're not given instruction 

20

that the decision should be about what the effect would 

21

be on TSA.  So the jury didn't answer that question. 

22

The jury shouldn't have answered that question.  But 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But does defamatory require 

24

that it be materially false?  Can't I defame somebody 

25

with a statement in  in which the derogatory

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

information is not material to anything at all, but it's 

2

just derogatory? 

3

 MR. COHN: 

Under the common law, Justice 

4

Scalia, the statement has to be materially false.  We 

5

agree with that.  And we also think that 

6
7
8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Has to be materially false 

to sustain what? 
 MR. COHN: 

To sustain a defamation judgment. 

Of course, it depends upon State law, but generally, 

10

under the common law, the statement has to be materially 

11

false 

12
13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Material to  to 

what? 

14

 MR. COHN: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

In 
I mean, you can have 

16

a defamatory statement about a pilot that's not material 

17

to  you know, air safety.  Is that what materiality 

18

goes to, the particular reason that the statement is 

19

made? 

20

 MR. COHN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, that's a very 

21

important distinction because, in the common law 

22

context, you're concerned about the effect on the 

23

person's reputation  his general reputation in the 

24

community, whereas, in the ATSA context, you're talking 

25

about a very particular listener.  The listener is TSA

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or a reasonable air safety official. 

2

 And the purpose of the report 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you're saying you 

4

can't defame  someone gets immunity for a statement 

5

that would be defamatory in the common law context if 

6

made generally, but because it's made in the context of 

7

information about flight safety, that's somehow immune? 

8
9

 MR. COHN: 

Correct, Mr. Chief Justice.  The 

statement might be deemed defamatory if you don't have 

10

the ATSA immunity, but because of the ATSA immunity, 

11

it's not materially false. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you call some TSA 

13

official and say this pilot  you know, is having an 

14

affair.  That's immune? 

15

 MR. COHN: 

That would not be immune because 

16

that would not be relevant to a suspicious transaction, 

17

suspicious activity, or passenger safety, so 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

a defamation, wouldn't it? 

20

 MR. COHN: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22
23

But it would still support 

Correct.  It would probably 
Because it is material to 

the person's reputation. 
 MR. COHN: 

Correct.  And it would not be 

24

immune.  But the report we had here is not that 

25

someone's having an affair, but, rather, the report we

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

made is that someone might possibly be giving rise to a 

2

concern. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, on the report that was 

4

made here, suppose that the report said that the 

5

Respondent  we believe the Respondent is mentally ill, 

6

or we believe the Respondent has serious mental 

7

problems.  Would you  would you make the same argument 

8

if that's what was said? 

9
10

 MR. COHN: 

With those words, I think I 

would, Justice Alito, because 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

12

 MR. COHN: 

You would? 
The same argument, yes.  Now, I 

13

think there are words that would cross the line.  I 

14

don't believe those words do because  a couple things. 

15

First, the gist of the statement is still the same.  The 

16

gist is this is a person who might possibly have a gun 

17

and might possibly be in a state of mind 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, the facts, as I 

19

understand it, were that he became very angry during a 

20

test  during a flight simulation test.  He took off 

21

his headset, pushed back his chair, threw the headset, 

22

started cursing at the instructor, and then later, 

23

he was  he was showing anger and cursing for a period 

24

of time in other parts of the facility. 

25

 Does it go beyond that? 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Is that fair?

Official

1

 MR. COHN: 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's a fair characterization. 
All right.  And you think, 

3

based on that, you could say, we believe this man is 

4

mentally ill? 

5

 MR. COHN: 

Justice Alito, I'm keeping in 

6

mind the first important piece of context, which is 

7

these reports are being made by tens of thousands of 

8

aviation employees on the ground that could have 

9

different educations and socioeconomic backgrounds and 

10

might not all speak the way we do, especially in an 

11

uncertain context in which the facts are rapidly 

12

evolving. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  What's so 

14

difficult about simply saying he's angry?  Why choose 

15

the word "mentally unstable"?  Isn't it with an intent 

16

to connote something more than the facts? 

17

 MR. COHN: 

A couple things, Justice 

18

Sotomayor.  First, it's not  the question is whether 

19

the gist of the statement is the same.  It's up to TSA 

20

to draw the connotations, the implications 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, yes, but from 

22

facts.  So isn't there a difference between saying 

23

someone's angry and someone's mentally ill 

24

 MR. COHN: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think 
 has a mental problem

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or is mentally unstable?  Don't you think that the 

2

intent is to convey something else? 

3

 MR. COHN: 

Justice Sotomayor, I think that 

4

different people express the same thought in different 

5

ways.  I think a baggage handler in Boston or a flight 

6

attendant in LaGuardia might use different words, such 

7

as "he lost it," "he went off the deep end," "he was 

8

acting irrationally," "he blew up." 

9
10

 And the lower court said 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, you could say he's 

11

nuts, but the question isn't whether somebody would say 

12

it.  The question is whether that is false.  I mean, the 

13

mere fact that  that a lot of people will  will 

14

exaggerate and say things that are simply not true 

15

doesn't make it okay. 

16

 MR. COHN: 

Justice Scalia, a couple things 

17

in response.  First, this is not a situation in which 

18

there's a simple statement and the person hangs up. 

19

There's a conversation with TSA, in this case, a 

20

10minute conversation, in which they probe behind the 

21

facts and they found out what happened, that Mr. Hoeper 

22

was angry and upset and he blew up that morning at 

23

training. 

24
25

 And second, the lower court recognized this 
and said, if we simply had used "irrational and blew

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

up," we'd be immune, as opposed to saying "mentally 

2

ill." 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But the point is that 

4

somebody ought to determine whether the exaggeration or 

5

whatever it was, was material, whether  whether it 

6

would have made any difference to TSA if it had been 

7

described otherwise.  And in this case, as I understand 

8

it, as  as the Colorado supreme court said, nobody has 

9

made that determination; right? 

10

 The Colorado supreme court says it doesn't 

11

make any difference whether  whether it would have 

12

affected TSA or not, putting it  putting it the proper 

13

way, right? 

14

 MR. COHN: 

15

absolutely correct. 

16

Correct, Justice Scalia, 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So that's what we're 

17

confronted with, simply, the  the need for somebody to 

18

make that factual determination, right?  And you're 

19

saying what?  There's no need to make it at all? 

20

 MR. COHN: 

Oh, no, no, Justice Scalia, we 

21

say that there is a need to make that determination. 

22

The lower court said no need, material falsity is not 

23

part of the ATSA analysis. 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

Where did it say 

"material"?  I thought  I thought  I think, so far

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as I've read this, the argument is about the truth or 

2

falsity of the statement.  And you're saying that the 

3

Colorado supreme court should have said it has to be 

4

false.  Isn't that your argument? 

5

 MR. COHN: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

They had to say it. 
Okay.  Now, I've looked 

7

at  I've looked at footnote 17  or footnote 6 or 

8

whatever it is on page 17, and I think that their 

9

characterization of the Colorado supreme court is right; 

10

that is, the Colorado supreme court is going to be very 

11

surprised if we tell them that they never said it has to 

12

be false. 

13

 What they said here is, "In the 

14

determination of immunity, we need not and, therefore, 

15

do not decide whether the statements were true or 

16

false."  Correct. 

17

 Why not? 

Because, they say, "The trial 

18

court properly submitted the case to the jury. 

19

Accordingly, the jury was entitled to determine the 

20

elements of a defamation claim, including whether the 

21

statements were false." 

22

 So, as I read that, which I think you'll 

23

hear from the other side in about  a few minutes, 

24

the  the Colorado supreme court says, look, the jury 

25

found that the statement was false, so we don't have to

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

worry about that, we're worried about whether the false 

2

statement was made with reckless disregard of its truth 

3

or falsity or knowledge that it was false.  Okay? 

4

 That's how I read the footnote. 

And they 

5

say something like that on  on page 30 and 31 of their 

6

brief. 

7

 So  so if I'm right about that, what are 

8

we supposed to do?  Are we supposed to say that matters 

9

of truth or falsity are not for the jury?  Are we 

10

supposed to say that the jury went beyond what any 

11

reasonable person would go  would do here?  What is it 

12

we're supposed to do? 

13

 MR. COHN: 

Justice Breyer, the lower court 

14

recognized that the ATSA immunity question is for the 

15

court to decide.  And because they left that issue, 

16

material falsity, to the jury, they said it's not part 

17

of the ATSA immunity analysis, and that's error.  It 

18

should 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But did the jury  did 

20

the jury find falsity?  Do you recognize that?  Did this 

21

jury find that the statement was, as you say, materially 

22

false? 

23
24
25

 MR. COHN: 

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  The jury 

did make that determination, but 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And how did  how did

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they make it?  Because the only thing I see is the 

2

special verdict sheet and it doesn't ask that question. 

3

 MR. COHN: 

Correct.  What the jury did, 

4

first of all  first of all, it shouldn't have gone to 

5

the jury because it's part of the ATSA immunity 

6

analysis, which is for the court to decide. 

7

 But, second, the jury did not ask whether or 

8

not our statement would have a different effect on TSA, 

9

which is the proper test here. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There are two  there are 

11

two different issues of falsity that we're talking about 

12

here, of materiality.  One is the defamation issue, and 

13

it is material to say that somebody is mentally unstable 

14

when all that he did was lose his temper.  Okay?  That's 

15

my view of it. 

16

 That does not answer the question of whether 

17

calling him mentally unstable, instead of he lost his 

18

temper or just saying he lost his temper, would have 

19

produced the same effect with the airlines, whether the 

20

airlines, even if he had said, well, he lost his temper, 

21

he's been fired from his job, he may have a  he may 

22

have a gun, whether that alone, without saying he was 

23

mentally unstable, would have induced the airline to 

24

take him off the flight. 

25

 There are two different questions.

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Materiality for defamation is  is quite different from 

2

the materiality for purposes of obtaining the immunity 

3

under this Act.  The latter question is for the court, 

4

but the former is for the jury, it seems to me. 

5

 MR. COHN: 

I agree completely, Justice 

6

Scalia.  That's absolutely correct.  And unless this 

7

Court has further questions, I would like to 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I do.  I'd like an 

answer  well, you can do it in your rebuttal, but I'd 
like an answer to my question. 
 MR. COHN: 

My answer, Justice Breyer, to 

12

your question is that the jury answered a different 

13

question.  They answered a question about whether it's 

14

material under defamation law, not whether it's material 

15

to TSA as required by ATSA and that determination should 

16

not go to the jury, that's for the court to decide. 

17

 And the lower court said, I'm not going 

18

to  we're not going to address that question, we're 

19

not going to address it because it's not part of ATSA, 

20

and that was legal error, as even Mr. Hoeper concedes.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN,

25

Thank you, counsel. 

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 
 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FEIGIN: 

2

please the Court: 

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 It's essentially undisputed that, in order 

4

to encourage airlines to report suspicious activity to 

5

proper authorities, the ATSA immunizes such reports when 

6

they're materially true.  I want to emphasize two main 

7

points about the scope of that immunity. 

8
9

 First, ATSA gives airlines very wide 
latitude in how they describe the suspicious activities. 

10

These reports are made against an inherently uncertain 

11

factual backdrop, and that's why the statute protects 

12

reports of any suspicious transaction relevant to a 

13

possible violation of law or regulation relating to air 

14

safety.  Misconceptions and exaggerations can occur, not 

15

only because of confusion about the facts, but because 

16

of the emotion, the stress, and potentially even the 

17

fear that may go along with making one of these reports. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Mr. Feigin, do you think 

19

that the statute, 44941, was intended by the Congress to 

20

incorporate the New York TimesSullivan standard, the 

21

Masson v. New Yorker standard? 

22

 And  and if so, then it  it seems to me 

23

that the airline is under a duty more strict than the 

24

one that you have just explained and the Petitioner's 

25

counsel has explained.

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, I think 

2

there's a distinction between Masson and this case. 

3

Masson follows the more general defamation law rule 

4

about whether a statement is materially false in terms 

5

of a person's reputation, whereas, here, the focus is on 

6

what a reasonable security official would believe. 

7

 And we think that's fairly seen in the text 

8

of the statute, which, again, protects statements about 

9

any suspicious transaction relevant to possible 

10
11

violation of law or regulation. 
 So what the statements are intended to 

12

convey is a suspicion of a possible threat, and the gist 

13

in this context, what has to be true in this context, is 

14

the suspicion of the possible threat.  Now, I want to 

15

emphasize that because the statute talks about 

16

suspicions and possibilities, that the actual factual 

17

basis for what's reported doesn't need to be 

18

particularly strong. 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So  so you want us to 

20

write an opinion to say that the  that the statute 

21

here is to be interpreted differently than if it were a 

22

New York Times and Sullivan case or MassonNew Yorker 

23

case? 

24
25

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, I think the 

only real difference is the context.  I think, in

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Masson, you were talking about readers of a general 

2

interest magazine, The New Yorker Magazine, whereas, 

3

here, the audience for these reports is much more 

4

specialized.  It's law enforcement officers who are 

5

receiving reports of suspicious activity. 

6

 Now, they're not interested in someone's 

7

reputation as a general matter.  What they're interested 

8

in is what kind of threat the person might pose and what 

9

might happen to an airplane in the next period of time 

10

that they have to worry about. 

11

 And I think it's particularly important that 

12

the Court give wide latitude to statements in this 

13

context because there's a substantially similar 

14

provision that protects individuals who make reports to 

15

law enforcement authorities.  That's in 6 U.S.C. 1104. 

16

 And I think it would be very unfortunate if 

17

someone responding to the TSA's ubiquitous "See 

18

Something, Say Something" campaign were to inadvertently 

19

or recklessly, as later concluded by a jury, have some 

20

sort of exaggeration about what they were reporting and 

21

then find themselves liable for civil damages, just for 

22

trying to 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I accept that for the 

24

moment  accept all that.  What's bothering me, a picky 

25

little point, but the picky point is that your statement

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the question, whether ATSA immunity may be denied 

2

without a determination that the air carrier's 

3

disclosure was materially false?  No, can't be.  But I 

4

read the footnote, footnote 6, last sentence, it says 

5

there was such a determination, the jury made it, and we 

6

don't have to go back over it. 

7

 So what are you arguing? 

Are you arguing 

8

that there should be like, as there is in free speech 

9

cases  you know, a special duty upon an appellate 

10

court to go back over such a jury finding?  Are you 

11

saying the Colorado supreme court was wrong in the 

12

second part of footnote 6 when it says the jury made it? 

13

 What am I supposed to do, in your opinion. 

14

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, what you're supposed to 

15

do in this case, Your Honor, is that the jury  the 

16

finding that the jury made  first of all, the jury 

17

wasn't actually instructed on materiality 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

They may have waived it 

you know. 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

But assuming, for the sake of 

21

argument, the jury found the statements were materially 

22

false, it only did so in the context of the State law 

23

defamation verdict.  And as Justice Scalia explained and 

24

as I tried to explain earlier, there's a difference 

25

between materiality from the perspective of someone's

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reputation and materiality for purposes of the TSA 

2

in inquiry that's 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

My understanding of what the 

4

Colorado supreme court did is this:  On the issue of 

5

ATSA immunity, it said, very clearly, that is for the 

6

court.  And it says, in footnote 5, it may  it gives 

7

no weight to the jury's findings of fact with respect to 

8

the facts that it found on the immunity question. 

9

 And then, at the end of footnote 6, what it 

10

said was, having found that there is no immunity, then 

11

it was proper for the trial judge to submit the 

12

defamation issue to the jury, and the jury made findings 

13

on the defamation issue. 

14
15
16
17
18

 Is that  is that your understanding as 
well? 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

That's my understanding of the 

supreme court of Colorado's opinion, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And are they right that, in 

19

determining ATSA immunity, the jury has no role, doesn't 

20

make findings of historical fact, who said what, 

21

anything like that? 

22

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

23

this is encompassed within the question presented, but 

24

our view, as we explain in footnote 6 of our brief, is 

25

that, under ATSA, questions of historical facts, such as

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what was actually said on the call and what actually 

2

happened, would be submitted to the jury. 

3

 Materiality is a mixed question of law and 

4

fact.  We believe that, also, it should be submitted to 

5

the jury, but with very careful jury instructions, 

6

making clear the very wide latitude that airlines have 

7

in this context. 

8

 And because airlines have such wide latitude 

9

in this context, we think, very often, the courts will 

10

be able to get rid of these kinds of cases at the motion 

11

to dismiss 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Then you disagree with 

13

Justice Scalia?  He drew a distinction between two forms 

14

of materiality, whether something's materially false, 

15

meaning is it misleading; that, presumably, would go to 

16

a jury.  But whether or not this misleading statement 

17

would be material to the TSA or to security officers is 

18

a question for the court. 

19

 You disagree with that position by him? 

20

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Again, Your Honor, we don't 

21

think the Court needs to address it here.  We actually 

22

think a jury would resolve the materiality question 

23

under the ATSA 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You'd give the jury two 

different instructions?  You are to find materiality for

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purposes of whether it's defamatory or not and then, 

2

having found that it is defamatory, you must make a 

3

second materiality finding, namely, would this 

4

defamatory statement have caused TSA  if it had been 

5

accurate, would TSA not have taken the action that it 

6

did, not have removed this man from the flight? 

7
8
9

 You're going to give the jury those two 
instructions on materiality? 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

We do think the court should 

10

give the jury separate instructions on ATSA, and then, 

11

if it passes the ATSA bar, you'd go on to defamation 

12

law.  But, Your Honor, I'm not going to fight the Court 

13

too hard if it wants to say that this is a question for 

14

the Court. 

15
16
17

 What I'd really like to emphasize here is 
that 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I actually would 

18

like your opinion, the SG's opinion, on whether this is 

19

an issue for the court or the jury.  I mean, you don't 

20

have to fight us.  What  what is your view? 

21

 (Laughter.) 

22

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Your Honor, we are comfortable 

23

with the Court saying that it's a question for the 

24

court.  Our reading of the statute is that it would be a 

25

question for the jury.  There'd be an instruction, as

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there was in this case, although not a proper 

2

instruction, on all the elements of ATSA, with the court 

3

making the law very clear to the jury that it has to 

4

apply for ATSA. 

5
6
7

 And then, if the jury gets past that, they 
would get a separate set of instructions. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Of course, you 

8

don't  there's no reason  and, presumably, a good 

9

trial judge wouldn't instruct the jury on those two 

10

separate questions using the same word, right?  I mean, 

11

you could articulate what you mean by "material" in 

12

in each context. 

13

 In other words, you don't have to say it 

14

would be material to TSA.  It would say just, as my 

15

colleague has suggested, whether or not TSA would have 

16

done anything different if a different formulation had 

17

been used. 

18

 MR. FEIGIN: 

That's right, Your Honor.  I 

19

think you could ask how TSA would have understood the 

20

statement with their particular eye towards the 

21

suspicion of a possible threat that's being conveyed. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And you'd  you'd feel 

23

snug and comfortable in making reports to airlines, 

24

knowing that whether you're going to be held liable is 

25

going to be up to some jury who is going to see that

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this person, his career was ruined, and it's going to be 

2

up to the jury to say whether he can recover or not? 

3
4
5

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Your Honor, we're 

comfortable 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That doesn't give me a 

6

lot  a lot of comfort.  If you're really concerned 

7

about enabling people to come forward without fear, when 

8

they have a suspicion of something, I'm saying, 

9

well  you know, some jury will decide whether 

10

whether you put it wrongly or not, and if you're putting 

11

it wrongly, it would have made a difference, it doesn't 

12

make me happy. 

13

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Your Honor, I think what's 

14

going to provide the adequate good feelings that 

15

airlines have making these reports, to make them feel 

16

safe making these reports, is for this Court to 

17

emphasize the very wide scope that the ATSA gives to how 

18

airlines characterize 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Feigin, they have 

20

that wide scope because of the actual malice standard, 

21

that somebody needs to show that there was actual 

22

knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard as to 

23

falsity. 

24
25

 And you're saying that we should do 
something different.  You're saying that we should

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

expand what falsity means in this context as a sort of 

2

extra protection, and I guess why is that true? 

3

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, I don't think 

4

we're doing anything different from the actual malice 

5

standard, except taking account of the context.  In this 

6

particular context, where there's a lot of factual 

7

uncertainty, a lot of emotion mixed in, and the audience 

8

aren't readers of, for example, a general interest 

9

magazine, they are security officials looking for 

10

suspicion of a possible threat, we think that the scope 

11

of the materiality test is very broad. 

12

 Thank you.

 Mr. Russell. 

15

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 

16
17
18
19

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 There are two sets of questions before the 

20

Court here.  There's a legal question about the proper 

21

interpretation of ATSA and maybe some subsidiary 

22

questions about the division of authority between judge 

23

and jury and what the materiality standard is.  And then 

24

there's a question about what to do with this case.  And 

25

those two sets of things should be considered

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

differently because much of what's being argued here 

2

today was not presented to the lower courts. 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So suppose I'm the trial 

4

judge and I conclude that, if Air Wisconsin had said to 

5

the TSA, along the lines of Justice Scalia's earlier 

6

question, We have an employee who was terminated today, 

7

he probably knew it, he lost his temper during a test, 

8

he might think that some of our employees are out to get 

9

him, and there may even be some truth to that, he's 

10

authorized to carry a gun, we don't know if he has one 

11

or not, we're giving you that information. 

12

 Suppose I'm the trial judge. 

I conclude 

13

that, if that information had been given to TSA, TSA 

14

quite properly stopped this plane to examine the pilot. 

15

Do I send the case to the jury? 

16

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Let me unpack that.  I think 

17

there is three parts to that question.  The first is 

18

implicit in that is ATSA immunity factual questions for 

19

the court or for the jury?  And we agree with the 

20

government that you should apply the ordinary qualified 

21

immunity standards and historical disputes about the 

22

facts are handled by the jury. 

23

 Of course, if the court can say, look, even 

24

on the plaintiff's view of the facts, immunity is 

25

proper, you can enter summary judgment.

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The second question is what is the 

2

materiality standard.  Justice Scalia, you've suggested 

3

that the standard is would TSA have done the same thing 

4

anyway?  And I take the government even to be saying 

5

that that's not the right test because we can't know, 

6

because TSA won't tell us. 

7

 TSA has to keep secret its procedures about 

8

what it would do and when.  And, as a consequence, I 

9

think the proper standard is the standard that applies 

10

under New York Times and in other defamation cases, 

11

which is the Masson standard.  Would a true statement 

12

have a different effect on the security officials' mind? 

13
14
15

 And we think you can have a gloss on that, 
that says 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, the Masson reporter 

16

for The New Yorker Magazine spent months on this 

17

article.  They had proofreaders.  They had editors in 

18

New York.  And you're saying the same standard applies 

19

to the baggage handler who has only 10 minutes to decide 

20

what he's going to say? 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I'm saying the same standard 

22

of material truth applies.  Actual malice, the 

23

subjective good faith, is the principal protection 

24

afforded to the baggage handlers.  Even if what he says 

25

is blatantly materially false, so long as he believed

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it, so long as he acted in good faith, he's protected 

2

here. 

3

 And so the question is, what happens when 

4

somebody like Mr. Doyle, who has been found to have 

5

acted in bad faith, and that's not challenged here 

6

does he, nonetheless, get immunity because what he said 

7

was materially true? 

8

 And we think the standard 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can we go back to the 

10

"who decides" question?  I find it very confusing.  Now, 

11

everybody seems to say, well, it's the jury that 

12

decided  that decides, but the Colorado supreme court 

13

said that it recognized that the court was to decide 

14

this question, not the jury. 

15

 And in this case, the jury decided it. 

That 

16

was error, the Colorado supreme court said, but it was 

17

harmless.  So who decides?  Is it  is it the court or 

18

the jury? 

19

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think that the answer to the 

20

legal question is that you have the same division that 

21

you have in qualified immunity, that material disputes 

22

of facts are resolved by the jury and then the court 

23

reviews those  those findings under the normal 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So in my  under my 

question, I first asked you, I'm the trial judge, I have

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

made the determination that TSA would have acted the 

2

same way.  I still have to submit this to the jury? 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

If  if you think that 

4

there's no disputes about those facts, that no 

5

reasonable jury could conclude otherwise on those facts, 

6

and you think 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, I thought that, even 

8

if the facts had been reported much more accurately than 

9

they were, that the TSA still had a duty to investigate. 

10

 MR. RUSSELL: 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

12
13

All right. 
Can't I make that 

determination as a matter of law? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't  I think the 

14

materiality question goes to the jury, subject to review 

15

by the court on the motion for directed verdict 

16

whatever.  But there's also  I also want to make clear 

17

that I disagree with the premise of that question about 

18

what the standard of materiality is, and it's not 

19

whether TSA would have acted differently. 

20

 It's whether TSA would have had a different 

21

impression about facts that are undoubtedly material to 

22

their determination, not only about the extent of the 

23

threat, but also what to do in the immediate aftermath. 

24
25

 They have to make a decision from the 
getgo, not only whether to investigate or not, but

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether or not to respond by sending an officer down or 

2

scrambling a SWAT team.  And certainly being told that 

3

somebody is mentally unstable and may be armed is going 

4

to be materially  be a materially different impression 

5

on their minds about those questions.  And that 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I'm not sure what 

7

you just said because, even the way you just phrased 

8

that, you're asking what TSA would have done.  How else 

9

can we think about materiality, other than by asking, 

10

well, if you were a TSA officer and you heard this, what 

11

would you have done? 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

You apply the Masson test, 

13

which is would a truer statement have a different effect 

14

on the mind of the reader?  It doesn't mean that they 

15

have to have done something differently.  It's just that 

16

they understand the facts differently than they do based 

17

on what was said. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you're saying, if 

19

it made a difference in their mind whether to send one 

20

officer to his house or a SWAT team somewhere else, 

21

that's material, and you lose immunity? 

22
23
24
25

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's materially false, yes, 

if the difference would have made a difference 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If the difference 

if the difference in the language causes TSA to do

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

anything differently, then you lose immunity? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think you would, but that's 

3

not the question.  The question is, would the statement 

4

have a different effect on the readers or the listeners. 

5
6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

A different 

effect  a different effect on who? 

7

 MR. RUSSELL: 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The listeners, the TSA. 
The TSA.  So  but 

9

that's what I'm saying.  Let's say the TSA person looks 

10

at it and says, ah, this is  you know, if it had been 

11

phrased as you say, ah, this is silly, I'm not going to 

12

do anything. 

13

 But he says, well, it looks silly to me, but 

14

I'm going to send it to my supervisor.  That's a 

15

different effect on the listeners' mind, and you say 

16

that difference causes the airline to lose immunity. 

17

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think so.  And in addition, 

18

whatever you say about this, you should also keep in 

19

mind what was actually argued below.  Let me say a few 

20

things about how this went down 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, before you get to 

22

that  before you get to that, to finish up on the 

23

point you were making earlier.  Suppose that the report 

24

is he ranted for 10 minutes, and then suppose the jury 

25

found he ranted for 7 minutes.

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Now, maybe those 3 minutes would make a 

2

difference  make a difference in the impression on the 

3

TSA.  That would be enough, in your view? 

4

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think it has to make a 

5

difference in the way that they would evaluate the 

6

existence, nature, or extent of the threat, and so it 

7

you know, it wouldn't make a difference to the way that 

8

they evaluated the nature or the extent of the threat, 

9

then it's not material. 

10

 But keep in mind, the way that this case was 

11

litigated below, they, themselves, proposed the Masson 

12

standard.  And it's  we've reproduced their brief to 

13

the Colorado supreme court.  It's on page 30a.  They 

14

say, "A statement is not considered false unless" 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Where are you reading? 
Page 30a of the Red Brief.  It 

17

is where we reproduced their Colorado supreme court 

18

brief.  And on page 30a, they say, "A statement is not 

19

considered false unless it would have a different effect 

20

on the mind of the reader than what the pleaded truth 

21

would have produced," and they cite Masson. 

22

 "This newfound ATSAspecific materiality 

23

test comes largely from the United States' invitation to 

24

brief at the cert stage in this case."  And they never 

25

asked for an instruction on materiality at all, much

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

less an ATSAspecific materiality instruction to the 

2

jury. 

3
4
5

 They never argued for an ATSAspecific 
materiality test in the lower court. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I think you're 

6

right.  They seem to rely mostly on the proposition that 

7

this all should have been submitted to the judge. 

8

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's correct.  That was 

9

their principal argument below, and that's clearly 

10

wrong.  And the United States agrees with us, that 

11

that's not the right way to  to go about dealing with 

12

this. 

13

 This is a statute that is premised on 

14

that is based on the model of qualified immunity.  In 

15

the Federal courts, qualified immunity factual issues 

16

are submitted to the jury and subject to ordinary 

17

appellate review, sometimes heightened appellate review 

18

with 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What are  what are the 

20

factual issues?  You said the factual issues.  I didn't 

21

think that there was much dispute about what was said to 

22

the air traffic safety.  So what are  what are the 

23

disputed facts that the jury would find relevant to the 

24

immunity? 

25

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So the materiality consider

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

compares what was said  and you're right, there's no 

2

dispute about that  and what was true, and there's a 

3

lot of dispute about that. 

4

 But we think that, at the end of the day, 

5

even if you say that it's a question of law for the 

6

court, even if you take it upon yourselves to decide it, 

7

we don't think that there's any way in which they can 

8

say that these statements were materially true. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So am I right in 

10

understanding that there be two  you would view these 

11

two scenarios differently?  The same historic facts. 

12

Somebody calls and said this happened, this happened, 

13

this happened.  He was acting crazy.  And the next one, 

14

this happened, this happened, this happened, and he's 

15

crazy. 

16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

 Do you think you lose immunity in the latter 
case, but not the former case? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

No, I think you'd lose in 

both. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You would lose in 

both? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Yes.  I mean, I think in 

both 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So a layperson  a 

layperson who  you know, just looks at this and said,

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

he's acting crazy, they're not immune from that?  If 

2

they called TSA and say that, everything is true, I 

3

guess you would say up until that characterization. 

4

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, let me be clear about 

5

that then.  If they give all the  all the facts  and 

6

I'm not sure what all the this is true, this is true, 

7

this is true  they simply explained all the facts and 

8

then appended to it their evaluation that showed he was crazy, 

9

I don't think they would be immune.  I think they lose 

10

immunity for that. 

11

 But that's not what happened. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13
14
15
16

But they would be 

the airline would be immune? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

The airline would be immune, 

correct.  But that's not what happened in this case. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no.  I know. 

17

But I'm trying to find out if you think there's a 

18

difference between the person's subjective, uneducated 

19

evaluation, "He was acting crazy," and a difference 

20

between that person saying, "He's crazy." 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't think there's a 

22

difference between that.  What's  the difference is 

23

when the person asserts that somebody is mentally 

24

unstable as a fact and doesn't give the background facts 

25

to allow somebody to make an alternative 

38

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So other than proving at 

2

trial that these statements were misleadingly false 

3

or false, how did you prove that the statements would 

4

have had an effect on a reasonable security officer? 

5

 MR. RUSSELL: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, let me  sure. 
How do you  what's the 

7

evidence that you expect parties to present and what was 

8

it you presented to show that their response would have 

9

been different? 

10

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, let me ask  answer the 

11

second question first, which is we had an expert witness 

12

who was formerly in charge of writing security 

13

regulations for TSA and the FAA before that who 

14

testified that, in light of the truth, a call wasn't 

15

even warranted, but that he perfectly understood why TSA 

16

acted the way it did, given the contents of the call. 

17
18
19

 Now, this wasn't a focus because nobody made 
the argument that this could be a materially false 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But we have granted cert on 

20

this question.  So  so given that fact, could we do 

21

this:  One, yes, it has to be false; two, the Colorado 

22

supreme court, because of footnotes 5, as well as 6, 

23

which I haven't picked up, and other things they've 

24

said, is at least ambiguous about the role the jury's 

25

finding played.

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And given that fact, what we'll do is we'll 

2

go through and see where the parties agree about what 

3

happened in  in the world, and insofar as they agree, 

4

we'll take it, you see.  Your side will get the 

5

underlying assumption, and looking at it, as it's agreed 

6

upon, we find either that it would be or wouldn't be 

7

within the scope of the immunity.  And on that one, you 

8

might lose. 

9
10
11

 But is there  is there  what do you 
think of that procedure? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I definitely think that 

12

it would be appropriate for this Court to write an 

13

opinion that says, look, to the extent footnote 6 

14

suggests that some true statements aren't protected by 

15

ATSA, that's wrong. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, it doesn't say that. 

17

It says  footnote 6 has to be read with footnote 5, 

18

which I hadn't picked up.  And once I put those two 

19

footnotes together, I have no idea what the Colorado 

20

supreme court says. 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I think you can say, 

22

look, we don't know what it means, but to the extent it 

23

means that ATSA doesn't affect all true statements, 

24

that's wrong.  But in this case, the jury found  and 

25

three courts  Colorado courts affirmed, that the

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

statements weren't true. 
 And, Justice Ginsburg, there was an 

3

instruction to the jury, and in Instruction No. 9 at 

4

page 579 of the Joint Appendix, I have been told the 

5

jury, that to enter a verdict, they had to find that the 

6

statement was false. 

7

 So the jury found that that was false. 

On 

8

appellate review, two courts of appeals found that there 

9

was sufficient evidence for that, even though they 

10

didn't ask for a materiality instruction.  Those two 

11

courts resolved every material falsity claim or every 

12

materiality objection that AWAC actually raised, in the 

13

context in which it actually raised it, which was 

14

whether we had satisfied our version  burden to prove 

15

the elements of common law defamation. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, on two of the  on 

17

two of the three statements, the difference between the 

18

literal  the very strict truth and what was said is 

19

very slight.  But you dispute that on  they'd said he's 

20

an FFO officer, and he may be armed. 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think that there's a huge 

22

difference.  There's no reason to say that he may be 

23

armed. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's literally true.  It's 

literally true.  He's an FFO officer.  He has a gun.  He

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

may be armed. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Suppose I were to know that 

3

there is a lawyer in town who has a concealed carry 

4

permit, and I know he has a hearing at the courtroom 

5

at the courthouse down the road later today. 

6

 If I were to call the security folks there 

7

and say, hey, just to let you know, there's a  there's 

8

a lawyer coming to the argument, and he may be armed, 

9

everybody would understand that I was saying to them 

10

that there was something more than the theoretical 

11

possibility that he's armed and that I have some 

12

information to believe that he is violating or intending 

13

to violate the law that prohibits him from bringing that 

14

gun to the court. 

15
16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 
statement? 

17

 MR. RUSSELL: 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

19
20

And what would be a true 

A true statement would be 
Not with respect to the 

lawyer; with respect to your client. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think it would have been 

21

true for them to say, look, we're calling to let you 

22

know, because Mr. Hoeper's an FFDO, we don't have any 

23

reason to believe that he has gun with him, but we can't 

24

tell for sure, so we just thought we would tell you, in 

25

case you have any questions and want to investigate

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

further. 
 By not saying  by not qualifying "may be 

3

armed" with the statement that "we have no reason at all 

4

to believe that he actually has a gun," which is the 

5

truth, I think they gave a very different impression 

6

and Mr. LaWare, for example, the vice president who made 

7

the decision to make the call, testified that, if he had 

8

been told, as a pilot, that a mentally unstable person 

9

who may have a gun was boarding his plane, it would make 

10

him very concerned about the safety of his crew and 

11

passengers.  This is at JA 271 to 272. 

12

 And as a consequence, he said those aren't 

13

the words I would have anticipated being used because he 

14

recognized, as somebody in the industry, what effect 

15

those words would have on a reasonable security person. 

16

So that 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But you're talking about a 

18

very subtle implication of the statement.  And I agree 

19

with you, there's an implication there that may not be 

20

justified, but you're talking about something very 

21

subtle in  in the context of  of someone making a 

22

call to report a possible threat. 

23

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, again, I don't think 

24

it's that subtle.  I think an ordinary person would 

25

would think I was being misrepresenting in the example

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that I gave, which I think is the same.  But in any 

2

event 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, just pursuing 

4

Justice Alito's point about the other statement, the 

5

other, that he was terminated today.  Well, he didn't 

6

get notice.  I mean, that  that's 

7
8
9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

We acknowledge that that is 

not an important part of our case. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And then the final 

10

thing, I guess, was the same thing Justice Scalia had in 

11

mind, was that he's unstable. 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, "Mentally unstable."  And 

13

that's  you know, this Court has used the phrase 

14

"mentally unstable" as a shorthand for describing people 

15

who are subject to involuntary commitment, and people 

16

who are barred by Federal law from owning a gun.  These 

17

are trigger words in  in this context.  So that 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you're not 

19

suggesting it would be a different case if they just 

20

said he's unstable, as opposed to he's mentally 

21

unstable, are you? 

22

 MR. RUSSELL: 

23
24
25

No, because I would understand 

that they're not saying that he might fall over. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
you were saying.

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that's what 

Official

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

When Justice Kennedy 

3

posed the question that he was unstable, you said, 

4

"mentally unstable."  And my point is that that doesn't 

5

make any difference to your case, does it? 

6

 MR. RUSSELL: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

 MR. RUSSELL: 

9

No, it doesn't. 
Okay. 

It doesn't.  I'm sorry.  I 

didn't mean to be facetious about it.  But I the point is 

10

that whether they said "unstable" or "mentally 

11

unstable," everybody understood it was the same thing, 

12

and it had the same implication, which is very serious. 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, they didn't  they 

said, we were concerned about his mental stability. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

They said that, but they also 

16

said he is unstable.  They said, "unstable pilot."  And 

17

when you couple those together, even if they just said 

18

they were concerned, I think that would be false and 

19

misleading, in part, because they weren't. 

20

 I mean, we had testimony. 

We asked them, 

21

"Did you think that Mr. Hoeper was mentally unstable?" 

22

And Mr. Orozco said, "I don't believe he was mentally 

23

unstable." 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Wouldn't you think it makes 

a difference we're talking here about a pilot?  I mean,

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

my impression of pilots is that they are supposed to 

2

remain perfectly calm, even when terrible things happen. 

3

Well, all the  you know, all engines are on fire and 

4

one of the wings has fallen off, but  you know, you 

5

don't start ranting and screaming. 

6

 And so someone described him as acting in a 

7

manner that was more unprofessional than they had ever 

8

seen.  Do you think that makes a difference? 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think you could take that 

10

into account, but you also have to recognize that, 

11

hopefully, this wouldn't be the same because most people 

12

don't get treated as unfairly as Mr. Hoeper was. 

13

 And I think there is abundant evidence for 

14

the jury to conclude that he was acting with  maybe not the 

15

best way, but he was acting within the  the spectrum 

16

of normal human reaction to being treated that unfairly, 

17

with respect to something that important. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But maybe for ordinary 

people, but how about for pilots? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think even for pilots.  For 

21

example, Mr. Sherman, who is a pilot, who's trained in 

22

spotting threats, testified  he's the one who got 

23

yelled at  testified that, when he left the training 

24

center, he didn't think that Mr. Hoeper was acting 

25

irrationally, he didn't think that he was a threat.

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 He was shocked to learn that calls to TSA 

2

had actually been made.  And Mr. Orozco talked to him 

3

briefly before he boarded the flight, and he knew, at 

4

that point, that he was an FFDO, he was a pilot, he knew 

5

about the last chance letter, he knew about the prior 

6

incidents of pilots taking down airplanes.  And he told 

7

him, go ahead, get on the flight. 

8
9

 There really isn't  these are the people 
who would know what is surprising and concerning about 

10

the conduct of our client in this case, and none of them 

11

were willing to say that he was, in fact, mentally 

12

unstable, and that's telling. 

13

 You know, even if they are willing to say 

14

now, through their lawyers, that they had concerns about 

15

his mental stability, the fact that they weren't willing 

16

to say that he was mentally unstable shows that they 

17

recognized that there's a material difference between 

18

those two statements. 

19

 Otherwise, they would have said, yes, he was 

20

mentally unstable because we had concerns about his 

21

mental stability.  And that's the same thing. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All of us have had the 

23

experience  at least I have, of  if I get very angry 

24

at something, one of my children will say, God, he's 

25

mentally unstable.  See, I mean, that's  people use

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that word in different contexts. 
 And what's worrying me is  is that some 

3

real threat comes along and the lawyers get involved and 

4

the people are going to report it to the TSA, start 

5

watching their words and they don't know what the 

6

lawyers mean exactly  and you understand the problem. 

7

 MR. RUSSELL: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

I understand 
So why isn't the best thing 

to say is, look, there is leeway here  considerable 

10

leeway on the part of the airline or anyone else who's 

11

reporting  that are reporting things to TSA.  All it 

12

means is they are going to search him more thoroughly. 

13

 MR. RUSSELL: 

There is enormous leeway 

14

already, and that is in the actual malice standard.  So 

15

long as the person believes that what he is saying true, 

16

so long as he doesn't suspect that it's untrue, he has 

17

immunity, even if it's grossly untrue.  And that's 

18

the  that's, I think, one of the reasons why  and 

19

you have that protection under the First Amendment to 

20

start with. 

21

 And that's one of the reasons why we're able 

22

to identify only six cases, and this is one of them, in 

23

the entire tenyear history of the statute, when 

24

anybody's even cited this provision in an opinion, 

25

published or unpublished, State or Federal.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And that's because the protection that's 

2

afforded by the actual malice standard, which comes in 

3

the First Amendment, but also in this statute, provides 

4

ample protection for people who are acting in good 

5

faith.  And I don't think that you need to come up with 

6

some special materiality light standard under this 

7

statute, particularly when there's no reason to 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Russell, weren't you, 

yourself, suggesting the twist on the materiality 

10

standard?  You said it shouldn't be  in the usual 

11

case, we said would it have had a different effect on 

12

the mind of, essentially, the average reader  the 

13

reasonable reader. 

14

 And you say, no, here, we're not supposed to 

15

think of the reasonable person, generally; we're 

16

supposed to think about the reasonable TSA officer. 

17

Haven't you conceded that yourself? 

18

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I think that's  that's 

19

an application of the Masson standard, which is if you 

20

know who the reader is.  I think it's reasonable to ask 

21

the jury to think about who the reader is, and  but 

22

it's a world of difference to say 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, how do we know about 

24

the reasonable TSA officer?  I mean, you made the point 

25

that we don't know a lot about TSA officers, in terms of

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what they are going to do with respect to any given set 

2

of facts, and  you know, I find it a little bit hard 

3

to think about the question, what does a reasonable TSA 

4

officer think, without thinking about the question, 

5

what's a reasonable TSA officer going to do? 

6

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, you have the same 

7

problem with figuring out what he's going to do.  In 

8

fact, it's much harder.  And so I think whatever  if 

9

you adopt that standard, you have the same problem with 

10

my standard, and I think my standard's easier to deal 

11

with. 

12

 I think you can look at  you can have 

13

expert testimony, as we did.  You can look at  you can 

14

ask the people who are in the industry and involved in 

15

the case, as we did.  And they all seem to recognize 

16

that saying somebody is mentally unstable versus saying 

17

we have concerns about his mental state or that he is 

18

angry would have a hugely different effect on a 

19

listener's mind in that industry. 

20
21
22

 That's why Mr. LaWare said he would be very 
concerned if those words were used and said 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  Tell me the 

23

difference between having a huge effect on that 

24

listener's mind and the listener taking a different 

25

action?  I'm not sure how  what the difference is.

50

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Well, the difference is  I 

I'm more upset 
I'm more concerned
 but  I'm more 

concerned, but I'm going to take the identical action? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I'm saying that you 

8

don't have to figure out what they would have done.  In 

9

part, this is just general defamation law, right?  You 

10

are entitled to presume damages, so long as what is said 

11

affects your belief about this person.  And there's 

12

nothing in this statute  there's nothing in the text 

13

of the statute that alters that ordinary standard. 

14

It's 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but it affects 

16

your belief is different in a context like this.  It may 

17

not affect your belief, but you may decide, but given 

18

what's at stake, I don't think he's mentally unstable 

19

just because somebody calls and says that, but I'm going 

20

to send it up to my supervisor, make sure he feels the 

21

same way. 

22

 And you tell me that you lose immunity if he 

23

says, I don't think he's mentally unstable and  you 

24

know, throws it away, in that  as opposed to when he 

25

says, I don't think he's mentally unstable, but let's

51

Alderson Reporting Company

2

see what the boss thinks. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, certainly, what they do 

3

with the information is reflective of the effect it has 

4

on their minds.  So we do think that, in any case, you 

5

could show that TSA would have acted differently.  You 

6

would necessarily be showing that it had a different 

7

effect on their mind. 

8

 But the problem is TSA is not going to tell 

9

us what they would have done if  if a different 

10

statement had been made.  This is not a standard that 

11

can actually be applied in the real world.  And at the 

12

end of the day, it's not necessary because there is 

13

substantial protection already provided to goodfaith 

14

speakers who will know that, so long as they are 

15

believing what they say, they can say whatever comes to 

16

their mind, without having to consult with their lawyer. 

17

 In any event, even if this Court thought 

18

that was the standard, even if you thought  and we're 

19

willing to forgive them for not raising that standard in 

20

the Colorado courts, we do think that, on this evidence, 

21

there was a basis for concluding that TSA would have 

22

acted differently, had they known the truth. 

23

 And that's because, as I said before, we had 

24

expert testimony from somebody who is very qualified in 

25

this area who said that, had he known the truth, as a

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

TSA official, he wouldn't have wanted to receive a call. 

2

And that  he perfectly understood the very dramatic 

3

response, given the content of what was actually said. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So what are the other things 

5

TSA could have done?  I mean, let's assume that this 

6

call was made and it was a much more  in tone, it was 

7

much more factual and without using any of these words, 

8

but it said the guy really lost his temper and  you 

9

know, he has this license, and we have no idea whether 

10

he, in fact, is carrying a gun, but he could be?  What 

11

could the TSA officers have done?  What do you think 

12

they should have done, short of what they did? 

13

 Say that they were concerned, they thought 

14

this might be a problem?  What are the midlevel 

15

possibilities about of a response? 

16

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So one possibility is  it 

17

depends, very much, on when the call was made.  Part of 

18

the difficulty here was raised was that Mr. Doyle waited 

19

for twoandahalf hours after receiving this 

20

information before making the call. 

21

 Had the call been made earlier, there was 

22

testimony there was lots of things they could have done. 

23

They could have called and checked to see if he had 

24

checked in his gun at security.  They could have found 

25

him.  They could have called him on his cell phone.

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But even when  having waited as long as 

2

they did, they could have asked somebody on the airplane 

3

to just go and ask him and talk to him and see if there 

4

was reason to believe that there was something amiss 

5

that would require going back to the gate. 

6

 Now, I acknowledge that, again, because the 

7

call was so late, there really wasn't a ton that could 

8

be done, but that's not a reason to give them greater 

9

leeway. 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you want us to say the 

11

call has to be made right away, without reflection, 

12

without talking to supervisors, without some quiet 

13

discussion first?  That's what you want us to put in the 

14

opinion? 

15

 MR. RUSSELL: 

No.  I mean, TSA has told people, 

16

report what you know immediately.  And so we do think 

17

that Mr. Doyle's conduct, in which he wasn't consulting 

18

with supervisors  he did nothing during that 

19

twoandahalf hours that would reflect that he had an 

20

actual concern about mental stability or danger here. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I thought I read 

22

somewhere that, after this incident, there was a 

23

discussion between or among Mr. Doyle and various 

24

government agencies to figure out how to avoid something 

25

like this in the future.

54

 MR. RUSSELL: 
yes. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

 MR. RUSSELL: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

6
7

He did testify to that effect, 

Who testified?  Doyle? 
Mr. Doyle did. 
And what was your 

sense  I don't remember the testimony now.  What 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't think he gave any 

8

details about the content of that discussion.  But, 

9

certainly, you can understand why TSA would not want 

10

something like this to happen again because  you know, 

11

when somebody is given false information that 

12

particularly when it leads to an elevated response that 

13

wouldn't have been necessary under a proper report, that 

14

gives rise to security concerns and dangers in itself. 

15

 When you send armed men onto a plane full of 

16

nervous people, in close quarters, who don't know what's 

17

going on, and officers who believe that there may be a 

18

man on the gun  with a gun, who's mentally unstable on 

19

the plane, that is a recipe for danger and for 

20

accidental things to happen and for people to get hurt, 

21

in addition to diverting attention from things that 

22

might be actual more  more serious incidents that 

23

are going on at the same time. 

24
25

 Congress didn't think that the way to 
promote airline security here is simply to give carte

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

blanche immunity to anybody who reports anything about 

2

suspicious activity, if they thought they could have 

3

ended at subsection A.  Instead, they recognized that 

4

there's a balance and that people who make badfaith 

5

reports that are materially untrue ought not to be 

6

immune, recognizing that there might be some deterrent 

7

effect at the margins, but acknowledging the need to 

8

strike this balance. 

9

 And in this case  whatever you end up 

10

doing in this case, and I would like to come back, 

11

before I leave, to this point, that this case has been 

12

litigated up the chain, without any request for 

13

ATSAspecific materiality instruction, with the court 

14

addressing every material truth objection that was 

15

actually made in the context in which it was made. 

16

 And it's important to point out that they 

17

never, even when they argued material truth, argued that 

18

mentally unstable  or were concerned about mental 

19

instability was materially true. 

20

 The only argument they ever made about 

21

that  and you can read it at the appendix to the Red 

22

Brief, was that this was a protected statement of 

23

opinion because it could not be true or false.  And 

24

there's a world of difference between saying that 

25

something isn't true or false and saying that it is

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

true. 
 Because to determine whether it's protected 

3

opinion, you only have to look at the statement to 

4

determine whether it's substantially true.  You have to 

5

look at the evidence.  And so they have not  at the 

6

very least, they have not preserved any argument that 

7

the statement "mentally unstable" was materially true. 

8

 So, at the end of the day, we think that you 

9

can satisfy the government's need for clarity about what 

10

the legal standard is by simply saying ATSA protects 

11

true statements, full stop, but, nonetheless, affirming 

12

this case  the opinion in this case on the ground that 

13

the Colorado court asked whether these statements were 

14

true and said that there was sufficient evidence that 

15

they were not and resolved every materiality objection 

16

that they actually made in the course of their opinion. 

17

 The fact that they did it under a different 

18

subheading, that they asked the right question under the 

19

wrong subheading, isn't a ground for reversal in this 

20

case. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How do you add to the 

22

question  the question in this case was put by the 

23

Court  the question whether ATSA immunity may be 

24

denied without a determination the air carrier's 

25

disclosure was material and false?

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. RUSSELL: 

The answer to that question is 

2

no, with the caveat that an appellate court has no 

3

obligation to resolve materiality objections, unless 

4

they're actually raised by the defendant.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN F. COHN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. COHN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Two very quick points: 

First, the mixed 

12

question, the application of law to facts most certainly 

13

should be decided by the court, not the jury just like 

14

this Court held in Muehler v. Mena or Nellis and Congus. 

15

 The historical facts are a separate 

16

question, but the ultimate question of materiality is 

17

one that should be decided by the 

18
19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, how do we decide 

what a reasonable security officer would do? 

20

 MR. COHN: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How do we decide it? 
How does  how  how 

22

do we as judges?  I'm not sure how juries would do it, 

23

I'm not quite sure how judges would do it.  So what evidence 

24

did you proffer?  He says he had an expert.  What did 

25

you have at trial?

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. COHN: 

We had experts, too.  And judges 

2

should resolve it, just like they resolve issues of 

3

reasonable force and probable cause.  They have to use 

4

judgment and common sense, in light of the broad leeway 

5

that TSA should be given in answering these questions, 

6

but the important thing is resolving that issue at the 

7

earliest possible stage. 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9
10
11
12
13

Yeah, but we don't 

decide whether it was reasonable force, if we think 
there's a question about that. 
 MR. COHN: 

If there's a question of 

historical fact, if there 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, no.  Not a question 

14

of historical  if there's a question about how a 

15

reasonable officer would respond.  There's competing 

16

experts.  Who decides that question? 

17

 MR. COHN: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, the  the only 
And there are some 

19

levels of  of force that we can say, as a matter of 

20

law, don't qualify as excessive, and we have said that. 

21

But when have we said that what might be excessive to 

22

one  to some, is a jury question  is a judge 

23

 MR. COHN: 

According  Nellis said the 

24

ultimate question is for a court to decide.  But our 

25

point is, first of all, the lower court here said the

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question is for a court to decide for ATSA immunity. 

2

But under any standard, we should still prevail because 

3

the matter of law, the statement here simply is 

4

immaterial.  Falsity  the alleged falsity is 

5

immaterial.  Under any standard, the Court should hold, 

6

as a matter of law, the standard here is immaterial. 

7

 And the second point I was going to address 

8

is the Court should address that application question in 

9

this case because airlines need guidance.  They need 

10
11

clarity.  They need predictability on what the law is. 
 And right now, there's no predictability 

12

because the lower court held that hairsplitting 

13

distinctions make a difference, that the difference 

14

between fire today and fire tomorrow is a material 

15

difference.  And the Court should make clear those 

16

hairsplitting distinctions do not make a difference. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Cohn, what if I 

18

think that TSA might have reacted differently to what 

19

was actually said and to what really should have been 

20

said?  Would they have reacted either way, they should 

21

have done something either way, but they would have done 

22

a different kind of thing?  What if I think that?  What 

23

does that suggest about the proper resolution of this 

24

case? 

25

 MR. COHN: 

I would say it matters on whether

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that different thing is material.  So, for instance, if 

2

it's sending one officer versus two officers to the 


3


plane, that's not material.  That does not make a 


4


difference.  This is a case this Court should decide. 


5


There's no material distinction between mental stability 

6

and mental state or rationality or blow up. 

7

 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
