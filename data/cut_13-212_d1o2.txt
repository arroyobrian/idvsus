 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (11:36 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

next in Case 13212, United States v. Wurie. 

5

 Welcome back.

 (Laughter.) 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

8
9
10
11

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 The facts of this case, United States v. 

12

Wurie, I think, illustrate why any categorical rule that 

13

would preclude searches of cell phones incident to 

14

arrest would be inconsistent with historical practice 

15

and detrimental to law enforcement. 

16

 This is a case where what the officers did 

17

was see a phone ringing.  On the outside screen, the 

18

caller was identified as "my house."  The officers 

19

opened up the phone, pressed one button to see that the 

20

call came in from "my house" and pressed another to see 

21

what the phone number was.  That's all they did. 

22

 That kind of a search serves valid, 

23

timehonored functions in the search situation of 

24

helping to ascertain the identity of the offender.  This 

25

was a crucial fact because a few minutes later, Wurie

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

lied about where he lived, which was relevant to the 

2

police ultimately obtaining a warrant to search his 

3

house.  They didn't know where he was.  They would not 

4

be able to 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not  I'm not 

6

sure.  If he was at the precinct, they could have gotten 

7

a warrant, and once he lied about his arrest, they would 

8

have known he wasn't living there and would have gotten 

9

a warrant. 

10

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Sotomayor, you could 

11

almost always say in searchincidenttoarrest cases 

12

that the police could have gotten a warrant.  It's 

13

I'm not talking about cases where somebody is carrying a 

14

gun and the police take the gun off them and  and they 

15

secure it that way.  But in all of the other cases that 

16

you could imagine that involve searches for evidence, 

17

letters, which occur in the historical cases; billfolds, 

18

which have been discussed here, once the officer has it, 

19

you could say the officer shouldn't be able to look in 

20

it because that could be done under a warrant.  There's 

21

no time constraint.  There's no destruction of evidence 

22

constraint. 

23

 Here, in fact, there actually is a 

24

destructionofevidence threat with respect to the 

25

general category of cell phones, and that's what this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

Court has been asked to look at, the general category, 

2

cell phones and smartphones. 

3

 We discussed earlier the threat of remote 

4

wiping and whether airplane mode is an effective counter 

5

to that.  There is the other threat that I think is even 

6

more critical to law enforcement today, and that is 

7

encryption.  Because if the phone turns off and becomes 

8

encrypted, officers can go to the magistrate and ask for 

9

a warrant, but it may be months or years or never if 

10

they can break through the encryption and actually 

11

obtain the evidence. 

12

 So to the extent that the traditional 

13

destructionofevidence rationale justified the search 

14

of a cell phone or justified the search of traditional 

15

items, it applies even more strongly with respect to 

16

cell phones than it does with most of the items that 

17

might be seized from a person. 

18

 So Wurie, I think 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Please tell me about 

20

encryption, because I know people can encrypt, but I 

21

thought they had to do that when they put the 

22

information in the phone. 

23

 MR. DREEBEN: 

No.  As best I understand it, 

24

Justice Sotomayor, many smartphones today are equipped 

25

with builtin encryption.  Apple has hardware encryption

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

and software encryption.  Samsung and HTC and other 

2

brands are quickly following with strong encryption. 

3

The encryption is deployed in a way that if you don't 

4

have the key, the data that's on the phone is useless. 

5

The key is often stored in memory and it's accessible 

6

only when you can get into the phone. 

7

 Now, if the phone is on and functioning 

8

because the person has been arrested while they are, for 

9

example, making a phone call, you can get access to the 

10

phone and you can attempt to get information from the 

11

phone without the encryption key being an obstacle.  But 

12

if the encryption is deployed, that can sometimes be an 

13

insuperable barrier even to the manufacturer. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not sure how on the 

15

scene the police are going to look at everything in a 

16

cell phone anyway.  They've got to be doing something to 

17

save it.  If the encryption can be 

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, no.  The  the evidence 

19

is  the information on the phone is encrypted  this 

20

is my understanding, Justice Sotomayor  but the phone 

21

itself has the key to decrypt it because the user 

22

obviously wants to get access to the information. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean, you have a problem. 

24

Apparently, neither you nor I actually have this on 

25

their phone, as far as I know.  So I'm imagining

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

something.  Maybe you have it.  There is some kind of 

2

system that once it goes "bzzz," you never can get the 

3

stuff again except after eight months, and when this 

4

"bzzz" happens, is it happens at least ten minutes after 

5

the arrest and not before, so the policeman would have 

6

time to look at it.  But the  by the time you get to 

7

the stationhouse, the "bzzz" has already happened, so 

8

now nobody else can.  Maybe there is such a thing.  I've 

9

never heard of it before this minute or before the 

10

briefs.  Well, why wouldn't  you see I'm similarly 

11

incredulous about it from my tone of voice because I 

12

don't see why somebody who wanted to "bzzz" actually to 

13

keep the police away wouldn't do it after 30 seconds. 

14

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So if you have an iPhone, 

15

Justice Breyer, and I don't know what kind of phone that 

16

you have 

17
18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't either because I 

can never get into it because of the password. 

19

 (Laughter.) 

20

 MR. DREEBEN: 

It's encrypted.  And that's 

21

the problem.  The phones are set up to protect the data 

22

and I think this is something also revealing about 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

My point is, somebody who 

24

really wants to go to all that trouble will surely have 

25

it turn off after 30 seconds and the policeman won't be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1
2

able to look at it either. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

3

clever that they manage 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Not all criminals are so 

Yeah.  Well, but the dim 

5

criminal who is thinking about the magistrate at the 

6

station but not thinking about the policeman.  I mean, 

7

you see what I'm doing with my questions? 

8

 MR. DREEBEN: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10
11

I think 
I'm casting a little cold 

water on this as a rationale. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yeah.  And I  my response to 

12

you is that having tried to ascertain the empirical 

13

reality of this problem, it is greatly feared by law 

14

enforcement.  We've documented that by the numerous 

15

studies, the National Institute of Standards and 

16

Technology study that talks about the grave concerns 

17

that encryption's raised.  It's not the biggest problem 

18

if you get the phone in an active state and you can 

19

begin to look through it.  It does have unpredictable 

20

capabilities of becoming encrypted if it's turned off or 

21

if certain apps are deployed on it.  And for that 

22

reason 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you have to keep the 

24

phone going anyway till you can get to a place where you 

25

do something with it.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. DREEBEN: 

A lot of these searches occur, 

2

Justice Sotomayor, at the side of the road where the 

3

officer opens  in the Riley case, the officer opened 

4

the phone right on the heels of the arrest and he 

5

immediately saw evidence that the individual was a gang 

6

member, something that he hadn't had personal knowledge 

7

of before, because every letter K was preceded by a C, 

8

which indicated to him it meant Crip killer, which 

9

indicated he was a member of the Bloods gang.  So it's a 

10

very common thing for officers to take advantage of the 

11

information that's on a phone just the way that they 

12

would take advantage of the information that's on a 

13

person to find out who they are dealing with. 

14

 And I think it was asked in the Riley 

15

argument whether there were instances in which phones 

16

have been used to trigger dangers.  And there are 

17

instances in which people have used their cell phones 

18

right before an arrest to call in a posse of their 

19

accomplices to basically attack the police.  And by 

20

looking at the cell phone quickly, if it's available to 

21

the  to the officers, they can look quickly and see if 

22

there was a text sent in the last five minutes or a 

23

phone call that might actually protect their safety, 

24

which is another one of the traditional justifications 

25

of search incident to arrest.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

 This is a categorical exception, as the 

2

Court recognized twice last term, both in Maryland v. 

3

King decision and in the McNeely decision, the Court 

4

recognized that searchincidenttoarrest was a 

5

categorical exception to the normal warrant requirement. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Dreeben, something 

7

that you said about the encryption.  What  what is the 

8

experience of the police?  Isn't it so that most cell 

9

phones when they're found on a person are not open, 

10
11

that  that they are locked? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Ginsburg, I would not 

12

be able to answer a question about what condition most 

13

cell phones are found in.  The fact that this issue has 

14

arisen repeatedly in cases across the country indicates 

15

that at least in a significant number of cases, the 

16

phones are not locked and the officers are able to 

17

obtain access to the information. 

18

 Now, if they are not able to obtain access 

19

to the information, I want to tie this back to things 

20

that could give the Court some comfort if the Court were 

21

concerned about the possibility for police searching too 

22

much evidence in cell phones that's not relevant to the 

23

crime for which the person is arrested or his identity. 

24
25

 Now, we talked earlier about the crime of 
arrest limitation, which I think would screen out a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

great many, not all, minor crimes.  The Court has, at 

2

least in the Welsh v. Wisconsin case, talking about 

3

exigent circumstances justifying an entry into the home, 

4

distinguished between serious and minor crimes.  That's 

5

another possible line that the Court could explore.  I'm 

6

not as much in favor of that one because I do think that 

7

the officers have an interest in determining, no matter 

8

who they have arrested, who that person is, because the 

9

person could pose an unknown threat even if they are 

10

stopped only for a traffic violation.  Ascertaining 

11

their identity through their cell phone is a useful way 

12

to do that. 

13

 There are also potential duration limits on 

14

a searchincidenttoarrest.  As its name indicates, 

15

it's incident to the arrest, and this Court's decisions 

16

have described the lowering or reduction of expectation 

17

of privacy of an arrestee as occurring for a reasonable 

18

time and to a reasonable extent after the arrest, then 

19

other Fourth Amendment doctrines kick in.  So to the 

20

extent that most of these searches are going to occur 

21

either at the scene of the arrest 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Once we put in that 

23

limit, you'll just download the phone at the station and 

24

everything, their medical records, their tax returns, 

25

even when they're not relevant to the crime, will be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

part of your database. 

2

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Okay.  Well, that  that is my 

3

last potential limiting principle.  This Court need not 

4

consider in this case the consequences of downloading 

5

the entire contents of a cellphone to a UFED, a 

6

universal forensic extraction device which the briefs 

7

have talked about.  That didn't happen in either of 

8

these cases.  These cases involve manual searches of the 

9

information that's available to the user of the phone. 

10

 Once the information has been captured into 

11

an electronic database separately in an extraction 

12

device, there is at least an argument that at that point 

13

the evidence is preserved and potentially the warrant 

14

requirement would have a different application, at least 

15

if the search of that forensic database was going to go 

16

beyond ascertaining identity and verifying officer 

17

safety considerations. 

18

 The Court does not need to examine that in 

19

this case.  It may well be that expectations of privacy 

20

do not exist as to information that the user himself can 

21

quickly access on a phone, the kind of thing the police 

22

are likely to look at when they make an arrest because 

23

they are interested in developing evidence that relates 

24

to the crime, protecting their safety and ascertaining 

25

identity.  They are not really interested in going

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

through all an arrestee's medical records and 

2

photographs and so forth. 

3
4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

limitation with respect to access to the iCloud. 

5

 MR. DREEBEN: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7

you tell the difference? 

8
9

Your brief suggested a 

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes. 
Could you tell me how 

Well, I think that would be 

something that officers would have to develop protocols 

10

based on changing technology to address.  We do not 

11

claim here the authority to use the phone to access data 

12

that is not on the phone, in the cloud, and it may well 

13

be that in the future more information will migrate to 

14

the cloud, less will be on the phone, and that may shift 

15

what the officers can actually do. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I thought the whole 

17

ideas of smartphones, Mr. Dreeben, and increasingly so, 

18

was that even the user doesn't know what what's on the 

19

cloud or not. 

20

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So to the extent that that is 

21

true, Justice Kagan, law enforcement officers, to ensure 

22

they're complying with the Fourth Amendment, would have 

23

to take the phone off the network.  And that is best 

24

practices.  It's discussed in all of the forensic 

25

manuals that we cited to the Court.  You want to take

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

the phone off the network to avoid the remote wiping 

2

problem, to avoid corruption of data through new data 

3

coming in.  It's sound forensic practice to do that and 

4

it also serves what we think is a limiting principle. 

5

Again, the Court doesn't have to decide that limiting 

6

principle in this case.  There's no claim that any cloud 

7

data was accessed in this case.  We're only saying that 

8

the searchincidenttoarrest doctrine serves a valuable 

9

function, serves a particularly valuable function with 

10

cellphones, because they are so commonly used as the 

11

medium of the commission of crimes.  They are carrying 

12

the same kind of information that the individual 

13

previously would have carried in paper and it seems 

14

somehow a little odd to say that because information has 

15

migrated from paper onto a smartphone that the officers 

16

have a critical need to obtain 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I don't think it's odd to 

18

say that we're living in a  in a new world.  Justice 

19

Kagan's questions point out the fact that someone 

20

arrested for a minor crime has their whole existence 

21

exposed on this little device.  From your argument, you 

22

want us just to adopt a categorical rule, it's in the 

23

custody of the police, they can search it.  Do you have 

24

 do you have any limiting principles that we should 

25

considerate at all as a fallback position?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes, Justice Kennedy, I do. 

2

The first one that I think has been discussed in both 

3

arguments and Justice Scalia has brought it up as well, 

4

is that the evidence to be searched, unless there's some 

5

exigency, should be relevant to the crime of arrest and 

6

the Court can articulate that in a way that would 

7

prevent roving searches or speculative searches. 

8
9
10
11
12
13
14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, that  that was for 

an expired license. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

So I don't think it's 

necessarily 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 or is it the guns that 

were under the hood in the other case? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

In the Riley case, the guns 

15

were under the hood and the arresting officers found a 

16

green bandana and some red and white Converse shoes, I 

17

believe. 

18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The crime of arrest was 

the expired license. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

No.  The crime of arrest was 

the firearms in Riley.  It was only after they found 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That's correct, after the 

stop, yes. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

 the firearms in the impound 

search did they actually conduct the arrest.  And at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

that point the ultimate search that occurred was because 

2

there was a known propensity of gang members to document 

3

their use of firearms in pictures.  And so that's what 

4

the arresting officer was looking for.  It's no 

5

different than what he would have looked for on the 

6

arrestee's person in his wallet.  So it wasn't the kind 

7

of cloudbased search, search into health records.  It 

8

was a scopefocused search. 

9

 So I think that there are limiting 

10

principles, Justice Kennedy, that you referred to.  One 

11

is when the officer is looking for crime of 

12

arrestrelated material and there is evidence that can 

13

be plausibly said is crime of arrestrelated material on 

14

the phone, he can look for that. 

15

 The Court could couple that, if it wasn't 

16

satisfied that that was a sufficient limitation, with a 

17

scopebased limit which would say that you can't look 

18

everywhere on the phone where there's no realistic 

19

chance that there's going to be evidence related to the 

20

crime of arrest.  You can't just rove through the phone. 

21

You need to keep a scope focus.  And that can be 

22

enforced and would be enforced by defendants, I can 

23

assure you, through post hoc litigation and suppression. 

24

And the police would have to conform their conduct to 

25

the constraints of the Fourth Amendment in conducting

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1
2

the search. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What do you mean by scope?  You can look 

3

at emails but not something else?  What would the scope 

4

limitation be? 

5

 MR. DREEBEN: 

It would depend on the crime. 

6

So if you were looking for evidence related to the crime 

7

of possession of child pornography, you could certainly 

8

go through photographs.  If you were looking for another 

9

crime, potentially drug trafficking, you would look for 

10

things like drug ledgers, recent contacts, lists of 

11

customers and not necessarily in videos. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It's very hard to 

13

see how that limit would be applied.  You can see and 

14

the police would be able to articulate why almost every 

15

application, every entry in a cellphone would reasonably 

16

be anticipated to have evidence of a particular crime. 

17

Obviously emails, obviously call logs.  Even, you know, 

18

Facebook.  I mean, if it's a weapons crime, maybe they've got 

19

pictures of themselves with guns.  I mean, I have 

20

trouble imagining what application, what entry police 

21

could not say it's reasonably likely that there would be 

22

evidence of the crime. 

23

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So, Mr. Chief Justice, to the 

24

extent that you think that's an inevitable 

25

generalization and there is a certain way of looking at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

it in which that's correct, then the interposition of a 

2

warrant requirement would do nothing because the warrant 

3

would say, search the cell phone for evidence related to 

4

drug trafficking and then the phone would be searched in 

5

exactly that manner. 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: No, the point of a warrant is 

7

that a person who is not involved and is objective 

8

listens to what the policeman is saying, knowing that 

9

sometimes, like me or any other human being, a policeman 

10

can get a little carried away.  So if, in fact, he does 

11

show the warrant, that there is this basis, you issue 

12

the warrant.  Many, many  and if he doesn't you don't. 

13

It isn't because they're different legal questions. 

14

It's just you want that third dispassionate mind to 

15

review what the facts are. 

16

 Now, if that's a purpose of having a 

17

warrant, how long does it take to get a warrant in the 

18

mine run of these cases?  Is it not a matter of hours in 

19

most places? 

20
21
22

 MR. DREEBEN: 

It may be in some places and 

not in others. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

In some places I'm sure 

23

it's difficult.  But I'm saying most places, major 

24

cities, et cetera, my guess was  and I want to be 

25

corrected if I'm wrong  it's a matter of a few hours

Alderson Reporting Company

and you could do it more quickly if you needed to.  Am I 

2

right about that? 

3

5

 MR. DREEBEN: 

I don't know that you are, 

Justice Breyer. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, you are in a 

6

department that keeps track pretty much.  You're much 

7

more expert than I.  And therefore I would like your 

8

best guess on the mine run of things of a range of time 

9

to get a warrant. 

10

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So, Justice Breyer, it varies 

11

considerably in the 50 States and the Federal Government 

12

depending on where you are, the availability of 

13

magistrates, the complexity of the case.  I would 

14

differentiate this from the McNeely case, where the 

15

Court was pretty confident that you could get a warrant 

16

quickly.  The reason that the Court could be pretty 

17

confident about that is drunk driving is a very simple 

18

crime, and the officer has very simple observations in 

19

order to validate it and there are forms that can be 

20

prepared to get a warrant. 

21
22
23
24
25

 With the great  we're talking now about 
every crime for which people are arrested. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I see your point.  I see 

your point. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

And the facts are going to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1
2

more complicated. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Assume a range.  But my 

3

question I'm trying to get to is this.  What, from what 

4

you've said is the harm in saying, yes, you need a 

5

warrant, but remember, there are exigent circumstances? 

6

So where is someone  the bell rings on the phone. 

7

Depending on the kind of crime, it may be pretty 

8

important to let the policeman answer to find out where 

9

it's coming from, because it may be other people on the 

10

gang who are coming with weapons.  Or alternatively, if 

11

you're right on the technology, it may be someone about 

12

to push a buzzer that will erase the information. 

13

 So remember we have the exigent 

14

circumstances.  If your view of the technology is right, 

15

they will perhaps be used with common sense and caution. 

16

But you don't need a special rule other than the rule, 

17

get a warrant.  How will that hurt? 

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

That is a special rule for the 

19

searchincidenttoarrest content.  It's  we've 

20

discussed a variety of special rules, but that rule 

21

completely compromises the interests in searchincidenttoarrest, 

22

because they have always assumed that the 

23

interest in police discovering evidence that could help 

24

them in the prosecution, that could protect their 

25

safety, and that would avoid destruction is paramount

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

given the reduced expectations of privacy of the 

2

arrestee. 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you work with exigent 

Circumstances. Why? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

No.  And this is why I  I 

6

hope that I can make this clearer, because the encryption 

7

problem is what makes it impossible for the police to be 

8

confident that you can take the time to go and get a 

9

warrant and you won't lose the data forever.  Encryption 

10

kicks in when the phone is turned to a setting that 

11

automatically will occur on most modern cell phones that 

12

turns the phone off and then the phone's contents become 

13

encrypted and that's when you need the password to open 

14

it up.  And if you don't have that password, you're not 

15

going to be able to do it.  And law enforcement's 

16

forensic labs aren't going to be able to get around it 

17

in  except with extraordinary efforts and 

18

extraordinary time. 

19

 So we're not talking about the difference 

20

here between two minutes to get the warrant and looking 

21

at the information.  It may be months if you don't take 

22

advantage of looking at it. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How do you stop it from 

going off? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Now, it  I think that one of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

the interesting things that Petitioner did in the Riley 

2

case was append to the back of his brief a couple of 

3

pictures of Apple's iPhone 5 on how you could go into 

4

the phone, if the phone is configured in the way that it 

5

was in the pictures that he took, and disable the auto 

6

lock feature.  What Petitioner did not do was provide 

7

similar information for the 500 or so other phones that 

8

are on the market and that will be on the market in the 

9

coming years so that police officers will be equipped 

10

with a manual that will probably be as thick as the New 

11

York City telephone book with the various procedures 

12

that are needed to prevent any phone from going into an 

13

encryption mode and becoming inaccessible.  They don't 

14

know that at the time they seize the phone, Justice 

15

Breyer, and that's why exigent circumstances, unless 

16

it's done as a categorical rule, because I did not know 

17

whether this phone would encrypt, I searched it, unless 

18

you do that, then you are basically putting the officers 

19

at the mercy of technology, which will increasingly be 

20

able to defeat their ability to conduct the kind of 

21

routine searches that they have always conducted in the 

22

past. 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, they've got 

24

their own technological front in this battle, too, and 

25

that's  I mean, to the extent there are flaws in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

Faraday bag, I wouldn't be surprised if that's not 

2

improved over the next months or years or whatever. 

3

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, it's an 

4

arms race between the forensic capabilities of law 

5

enforcement labs and the abilities of cell phone 

6

manufacturers and criminals to devise technologies that 

7

will thwart them.  And they will leapfrog each other at 

8

times and there may be periods when law enforcement has 

9

the advantage and there may be period where  periods 

10

where those people who want to protect against 

11

revelation of data on the phone will succeed. 

12

 And my only point here is that it would not 

13

be a wise rule for this Court to announce, based on 

14

today's technology and reasonable projections of 

15

technology, that the police will just easily be able to 

16

go and get a warrant, because my experience from the 

17

people that I had spoken with is that a lot of phones 

18

are arriving at the lab in a locked and encrypted state 

19

and it's very tough to deal with that.  And if the Court 

20

does have concerns, as many members of the Court have 

21

expressed, about applying, lock stock and barrel, the 

22

traditional Robinson rule, there are weigh stations and 

23

compromise positions. 

24
25

 This case, I think, as California pointed 
out, both this case and Riley, don't really involve

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

totally unpacking somebody's life from their smartphone. 

2

And I'm not suggesting that the Court should resolve 

3

these cases by announcing a rule that's just limited to 

4

the facts of the cases.  But if the Court is looking to 

5

preserve some areas for protection, we've talked about 

6

limiting the justification for a search, limiting the 

7

scope of a search, limiting the duration of a search, 

8

and limiting the intensity in the sense of confining it 

9

to what can be found manually on the phone. 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Do you  do you see what I 

11

was trying to do with the word "exigency?"  I was trying 

12

to figure out if that's a way of dealing with the 

13

unknown here, which is your problem.  That if, in fact, 

14

technology is such that the policeman, it's really true 

15

if he has five minutes to search, he can get this 

16

valuable evidence and if the technology is such that it 

17

doesn't even give him five minutes, or if it's such that 

18

it gives him four or five hours, or if it's such that he 

19

can press a button, or if it's the opposite and they can 

20

just cough and encrypt it, well, all that will be fed 

21

into the word "exigency," which we wouldn't have to 

22

decide now, but rather, you could make your arguments 

23

about the real exigency for preventing the destruction 

24

later in the context of  of what turns out to be the 

25

technology of the time.  That's what was going on.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Breyer, the reason why 

2

Robinson adopted a categorical rule is it concluded that 

3

such casebycase adjudication for officers in the field 

4

is completely infeasible.  And when balancing the 

5

important law enforcement interests against the reduced 

6

expectations of privacy, Robinson struck a categorical 

7

balance.  Reverting to an exigent circumstances analysis 

8

here would unstabilize all of the law under Robinson. 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How about a plain view 

10

analysis?  Turn on the phone, see if there's been a 

11

telephone call within a reasonable amount of time of the 

12

arrest or  or any message that was sent at the time of 

13

arrest.  That's sort of a plain view situation.  It 

14

would take care of your person with the picture of him 

15

or herself with guns.  It would take care of the call to 

16

the confederate.  It would take care of the  of the 

17

imminent destruction of the phone. 

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So, Justice Sotomayor, I'm not 

19

entirely sure how to articulate that principle, but if 

20

it fits within the crime of arrest plus identity 

21

principle, then I think it would be a reasonable 

22

fallback position. 

23

 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH H. MIZNER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

3

 MS. MIZNER: 

4

please the Court: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

5

 I'd like to first talk about the encryption 

6

that we've been discussing.  It's not an issue in this 

7

case.  It was not an issue in Riley.  It was not 

8

litigated below.  And the government has just now said 

9

that there are a lot of phones arriving at a lab in a 

10

locked state, but do we know whether they're in a locked 

11

state because they were locked at the time that they 

12

were seized or did they lock subsequently? 

13

 The number of passwordprotected phones that 

14

are open at the time of arrest is pure speculation.  And 

15

if they're not open at the time of arrest, the 

16

government's argument about locking is irrelevant.  The 

17

number of passwordprotected phones that would be 

18

inaccessible at a later time is also an unknown and 

19

and speculative quantity. 

20

 There are devices that can break passwords. 

21

Technology advances on both fronts.  The government has 

22

capabilities of breaking the more typical passwords, the 

23

fourdigit, four letter passwords within 15 minutes.  There 

24

are  you can obtain assistance from manufacturers in

We've  we've kind

3

be fair to Mr. Fisher or Mr. Dumont, we're talking about 

4

their case, but in your case why isn't the information 

5

in plain view?  It says, "my house, my home."  They look 

6

at it, that's what they see.  They don't have to open 

7

anything.

10

 MS. MIZNER: 

They saw the words "my house." 

They did have to open the phone and access the log to

Sure.  But I'm 

11

saying do you have  you have no objection to the "my 

12

house"? 

13

 MS. MIZNER: 

The "my house" words were in 

14

plain view.  And under this Court's doctrine, that's 

15

not 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I assume that that's 

17

 it says "my house" because he's done something with 

18

the particular number.  If he didn't, it would be the 

19

number itself that would show up, right?

 MS. MIZNER: 

21

Yes.  And that's part 

22

also be in plain view? 

23

 MS. MIZNER: 

24
25

And so that would 

The number was not in plain 

view. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

No, no.  But I mean,

Official

28
1

in a  in a case in which the user had not coded the 

2

particular number, the number would show up, I think, 

3

right? 

4

 MS. MIZNER: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6

 MS. MIZNER: 

7

Yes.  And 
And that would be 

And the number would be in 

plain view. 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

 MS. MIZNER: 

Okay. 

But what makes the  the 

10

privacy interest and the associational interest in 

11

simply the call logs, which the government has talked 

12

about in Mr. Wurie's case, is that it does contain more 

13

than simply the numbers dialed.  You have the 

14

associational information that's created by the user. 

15

In this case, it was linking my house to a particular 

16

number. 

17

 It can go well beyond that. 

You can link 

18

names and nicknames to  and places to a number.  You 

19

can link emails to a name and a number.  You can link a 

20

relationship to a name and a number.  Doctor, shrink, 

21

mom, dad.  You can link a photograph to a number.  You 

22

can link your number  you can link it to text 

23

messages.  You can link it to other numbers. 

24

 So you can provide pattern  and also 

25

patterns of calling that provide additional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

associational data and could indicate the closeness of a 

2

relationship.  How often calls were made, when are they 

3

made, what's the time of the call, when did it start or 

4

stop, the length of the call.  You can link notes, 

5

either general or about a particular phone call. 

6
7
8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What do you think, 

if the phone rings, can the police answer it? 
 MS. MIZNER: 

The cases that have addressed 

9

answering the phone have been in the context of search 

10

warrants for houses where, as the police are searching 

11

the house, the phone has been ringing.  And the courts 

12

have said that  lower courts have said that where 

13

answering the phone can be viewed as being within the 

14

scope of the search warrant, it is permissible for the 

15

police to answer the phone. 

16
17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what about 

this case where there isn't a search warrant? 

18

 MS. MIZNER: 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

They didn't answer the phone. 
The number's in 

20

plain view.  I mean, is answering the phone  can you 

21

do it or not?  You know what number is calling.  Is it 

22

like someone  you're conducting a search on the house 

23

and somebody knocks on the door?  You can open the door, 

24

right? 

25

 MS. MIZNER: 

Yes.  And they perhaps could

have answered the phone in this case, but they didn't. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, but what is your 

3

position?  What is the rule you want us to adopt in 

4

response to the Chief Justice's question? 

5

 MS. MIZNER: 

6

answer the phone. 

7

I would say that they could 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Under what theory?  I 

8

don't disagree with you.  I just want to know what would 

9

be your theory, and what's the limitation? 

10

 MS. MIZNER: 

Well, in the sense it's  it's 

11

plain hearing.  It is a  an analogue of plain view. 

12

There is nothing particularly private about the ringing. 

13

And if you  the policeman can answer the phone.  It 

14

doesn't mean that the person on the other end has to 

15

respond.  It's 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I was thinking in terms 

17

of reasonable expectation of privacy.  Most people don't 

18

pick up other people's phones to answer them unless the 

19

phone is lost.  And then you pray the person who found 

20

it answers it. 

21

 (Laughter.) 

22

 MS. MIZNER: 

23
24
25

And perhaps this would be 

analogous to  to that.  So the 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So do you think 

it's got nothing to do with plain hearing.  I'm not

31

saying they can't  obviously they can hear the ring. 

2

I'm just  it's a big, different step to answer it. 

3

 MS. MIZNER: 

If the police have seized the 

4

phone and they can secure it, pending application for a 

5

warrant to engage in a search of its contents, then

answering the phone could be viewed as part of  of

13

articulated, that there is an expectation of privacy in 

14

the call log.

All right.  Does the  does

the owner have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a 

24

list of the numbers called? 

25

 MS. MIZNER: 

Not in the list of the numbers

Alderson Reporting Company

alone, but the call log is not limited to that list of 

2

numbers.  And your phone bill may not necessarily 

3

include, depending on the kind of plan you have, may not 

4

include information about the length of the call or 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The cell phone company won't 

have information about the length of the call? 
 MS. MIZNER: 

I think it would depend on 

8

whether they keep that information, it would depend on 

9

what kind of plan you have. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what are we dealing 

11

with here?  I know everybody wants to talk about global 

12

issues, but what  what are the  what information are 

13

we talking about in this case?  We have my home, which 

14

you said is in plain view, my house, and then you have 

15

the call log. 

16

 What else do we have? 

17

 MS. MIZNER: 

That was all that was accessed. 

18

We're talking about the phone number that allowed the 

19

police to get to a particular premises. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if the call log, the 

21

numbers called, is not covered by a reasonable 

22

expectation of privacy, and my house is not covered by a 

23

reasonable expectation of privacy, then where is the 

24

search? 

25

 MS. MIZNER: 

It  the search is in opening

the phone itself, which is covered by a reasonable 

2

expectation of privacy.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

look for a razor blade? 

6

8

No, they could 

You could  you are then 
Flip open the old style 

flipphone to see if there's something inside? 
 MS. MIZNER: 

Yes, you could examine it, but 

10

that is not going to get you the phone number.  You had 

11

to push  the officer here had to push a button in 

12

order to get access to the call logs.  There were two 

13

buttons that 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So you have a reason  but what 

15

is  where is  what is the reason  by pushing the 

16

button, you get information that you just told me is not 

17

covered by a reasonable expectation of privacy. 

18

 MS. MIZNER: 

No, Justice Alito, I believe I 

19

said that the information is covered by a reasonable 

20

expectation of privacy because there is associational 

21

information that is inputted by the owner of the phone. 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes, but was any of that 

used here? 
 MS. MIZNER: 

It was the link between my 

house and the  and the number, yes, that  that got

34

2

them to the premises. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, they saw that the number 

3

they saw the phone rang at a particular time, and then 

4

if you look at the call log, you can see what call came 

5

in at that particular time.  And then you know where the 

6

call came from that registered as my house. 

7

 MS. MIZNER: 

But you wouldn't know that it 

8

was my house absent the information that the owner of 

9

the phone had put in. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why  why is that 

11

so and maybe I don't understand the facts. 

12

If  if a phone rang right now and you look at the call 

13

log and you see what call came in at 12:13, and you know 

14

that the call came from my house, and you see the number 

15

from  of the call that came in at 12:13, wouldn't you 

16

know that that was the number from my house? 

17

 MS. MIZNER: 

But you wouldn't know from the 

18

call log alone without information input by the phone 

19

owner on that log that it was my house once they get the 

20

number.

wasn't  if it wasn't input, you would have the number

obtained? 
 MS. MIZNER:

17

issue.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And 
Is  may the police or 

20

may not the police examine a wallet, find the number 

21

that says my house, and act on that information to 

22

investigate the crime?  Yes or no? 

23

 MS. MIZNER: 

This Court has not addressed 

24

the reading of information examined in  in  in 

25

searching for incident to arrest.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, it seems to me that 

2

it's fairly clear that it's part of the contents that 

3

are seized, that are on  in the possession of the 

4

arrestee, and that the police can act on it. 

5

 MS. MIZNER: 

Well, under the justifications 

6

of Chimel and  which were reiterated in  in Robinson 

7

and in Gant and McNeely, the justifications are officer 

8

safety and evidence preservation.  It doesn't  which 

9

does not necessarily encompass reading. 

10

 But to address the case of the cell phone, I 

11

don't think you have to resolve whether it's appropriate 

12

to read paper documents that you come across in 

13

examining a paper or not. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, but the point is 

15

the only  the only information they got and used was 

16

the phone number and address of his house, right? 

17

And  and that it was his house, right? 

18

 MS. MIZNER: 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

20
21

But that 
That's on your 

driver's license, isn't it?  So  and 
 MS. MIZNER: 

Your residence is, but this was 

22

not  then they needed his driver's license, which they 

23

had. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So I guess I'm just 

trying to see what greater invasion of privacy there was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

in this case than the police looking at your driver's 

2

license when you're carrying it around in your wallet. 

3

 MS. MIZNER: 

Because my house may not 

4

necessarily be the house in which you reside.  You may 

5

have chosen to attach that description 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So the problem here 

7

was that he called  he indicated that a number was his 

8

house, and it might not have been his house? 

9

 MS. MIZNER: 

The problem is that the police 

10

searched his phone in order to associate information 

11

contained in the phone with what they were able to 

12

observe in plain view. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

buttons, two buttons. 

15

 MS. MIZNER: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

There had to be two 

Yes. 
Now, was there a claim made 

17

in this case that exigent circumstances, destruction of 

18

evidence, or officer safety justified the search? 

19

 MS. MIZNER: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 So I guess that if there is a rule that says you 

No. 
No?  Okay. 

22

can search phones, then you could do it.  After all, you 

23

might search a phone and come up with an advertisement 

24

for a Walt Disney movie, which is perfectly public. 

25

 But if the rule is you can't search phones,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

then you win, even though in this case they came up with 

2

something that was  is  is that right or not? 

3

 MS. MIZNER: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  So 
I mean, if, in fact, you 

5

can search the phone thoroughly for everything in the 

6

person's life, they might have come up with something 

7

when he was six years old, there is, in fact, a picture 

8

of an elephant at the zoo.  Totally public. 

9

 But it would still fall within the rule, 

10

which what I thought one of the things we're arguing 

11

about in this case. 

12

 MS. MIZNER: 

Yes, Justice Breyer, and we 

13

believe that the seizeandsecure rule that we are 

14

proposing meets the needs of law enforcement by allowing 

15

them to maintain custody of the 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Well, what is 

17

your argument for the proposition, look, when you search 

18

a phone, sometimes what you come up with is perfectly 

19

public information; sometimes what you come up with is 

20

private information.  Now, you want to say the absolute 

21

rule should be no. 

22

 But what's your argument, rather than trying 

23

to say sometimes if you get the private information, no; 

24

but if you get the public information, yes, et cetera? 

25

 MS. MIZNER: 

Because everything is so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

intermingled on a cell phone or a tablet or a computer, 

2

you don't know what you're going to be getting when you 

3

push those buttons and start rummaging through the 

4

digital contents of the phone. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In determining whether the 

6

examination of information on a cell phone is 

7

constitutes a search, what do you think we  we are 

8

doing?  Are we trying to  to  are we answering an 

9

empirical question, what is the reasonable expectation 

10

of privacy of a  of a person in 2014 who has a cell 

11

phone in his or her  on his or her person?  Or are we 

12

legislating what we think is a good privacy rule? 

13

 MS. MIZNER: 

I think the Court is 

14

determining whether or not in 2014 an individual has a 

15

reasonable expectation of privacy against government 

16

intrusion into a device that carries around an 

17

increasingly large percentage of somebody's personal and 

18

private information. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  Well, a lot of 

20

that  part of that is the person must act  people 

21

must actually have that expectation.  That must be the 

22

expectation of people at large in 2014, that they think 

23

that everything that's on their cell phones is private, 

24

or they think some of the information on the cell phones 

25

is private, or they think nothing on the cell phone is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

private.  Where do you think we should look to answer 

2

that question about what people in 2014 think about that 

3

question? 

4

 MS. MIZNER: 

I think from the fact that 

5

people carry them with them in  in a pocket or in a 

6

purse, that that exhibits an expectation of privacy. 

7

You don't expect people to be rummaging through your 

8

pockets or  or through the items you're carrying. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But why is that so?  Cell 

10

phones are different.  I'm not going to say for a 

11

suggest for a second that there are like things that 

12

existed in the predigital area.  But in the predigital 

13

era, presumably people didn't have a reasonable 

14

expectation of privacy in papers, letters, things like 

15

that that they had, of photos in a billfold, numbers, 

16

addresses, things that they might  they might be 

17

carrying on their persons. 

18

 MS. MIZNER: 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

20
21
22
23

You 
So how do we determine what 

the  what the new expectation of privacy is now? 
 MS. MIZNER: 

I think people did have an 

expectation of privacy in those items until 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Then why was it not a search 

24

when  when you  you searched the pocket of somebody 

25

who was arrested and you found the address of someplace?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

 MS. MIZNER: 

I believe it is a search, 

2

Justice Alito.  It's a question of whether it is a 

3

search that has been justified by an exception to the 

4

warrant requirement, the  the scope  or the 

5

permissible scope of the search incident to arrest. 

6

It's still a search. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  What was the 

8

why  how do we determine whether something has 

9

somebody has a reasonable expectation of privacy in any 

10

category of information that is contained on a cell 

11

phone? 

12

 MS. MIZNER: 

Because of the 

13

interconnectivity of the data, I don't think you can say 

14

a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in this 

15

app, but not that app, because you don't know what is 

16

linked to any other part of the cell phone.  So the rule 

17

that provides the security that the Fourth Amendment is 

18

intended to give an individual would be to say 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Are  are you  I 

20

I  I'm assuming that what you're saying  you just 

21

said it a minute ago  the Fourth Amendment, the 

22

searches incident to arrest are an exception to the 

23

Fourth Amendment? 

24

 MS. MIZNER: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 
And is it your position,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

I  I'm assuming this is what this argument's been 

2

about, which is whether we're going to extend that 

3

exception of  the exception of searches incident to 

4

arrest to a new category, cell phones

Whether 
 which are different 

than the traditional item. 
 MS. MIZNER: 

Whether the scope of a 

justifiable searchincidenttoarrest is going to 
include a search of  of the cell phone. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why do you say they are an 

12

exception to the Fourth Amendment?  They just don't 

13

violate the Fourth Amendment.  I mean, the Fourth 

14

Amendment covers certain things and it doesn't cover 

15

other things.  The things that it doesn't cover are 

16

not  not  not exceptions.  They're just things not 

17

covered. 

18

 MS. MIZNER: 

Well, this Court has espoused a 

19

warrant presumption and has said  has classified the 

20

searchincidenttoarrest exigent circumstances as 

21

exceptions to the warrant requirements saying that the 

22

preference is for a warrant to be obtained, and under 

23

certain welldefined circumstances, we are going to say 

24

that you need not. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, but that  that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

presumption is  is simply not  you don't believe 

2

that presumption, do you? 

3

 MS. MIZNER: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I do. 
There are many more 

5

searches conducted without a warrant than with a warrant 

6

I  I bet.  I mean, any automobile search, any 

7

inventory search, any  any search of  of businesses. 

8

All sorts of searches are conducted without a warrant. 

9

 But you still believe that a warrant is the 

10

rule and everything else is the exception.  I think it 

11

may be the opposite, actually. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

have swallowed the rule. 

14

 MS. MIZNER: 

Unless the exceptions 

In the exceptions, viewing the 

15

searchincidenttoarrest exception as having per  as 

16

having limited parameters as the First Circuit did 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The  the question is 

18

whether it's an unreasonable search, and the warrant 

19

clause follows much later.  The question is:  Is this an 

20

unreasonable search? 

21

 MS. MIZNER: 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

23

Constitution provides. 

24

 MS. MIZNER: 

25

But this Court has 
That's what the 

This Court has said in many 

instances that a search not conducted pursuant to a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

warrant is unreasonable unless it falls within one of 

2

the welldefined exceptions that this Court has 

3

recognized to the warrant requirement.  But 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, it's a search that's 

reasonable.  That's not necessarily an exception. 
 MS. MIZNER: 

But in terms of reasonableness, 

7

this Court is balancing the intrusion against the 

8

individual's interest in privacy 

9
10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 
 MS. MIZNER: 

Yeah, and that's the 
 a traditional balancing 

11

test, and we suggest that  that balance here supports 

12

the seize and secure rule that we are advocating. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No.  I understand that.  But 

14

that  that's the question that I was asking before. 

15

Is it a reasonable search or seizure?  All right.  So 

16

you have to balance the privacy interest versus the law 

17

enforcement interest. 

18

 And how do  how do we find out what the 

19

privacy interests are  what the privacy expectations 

20

are, which go into that balance with respect to cell 

21

phones in 2014? 

22

 MS. MIZNER: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, on 
Does it matter?  You think 

24

it doesn't matter?  Maybe people feel very strongly 

25

every single thing that's in the cell phone is  is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

private, or maybe they don't.  Maybe they think some 

2

things are private; some things are not private. 

3

 MS. MIZNER: 

I think that by virtue of the 

4

fact that you carry them around in a generally enclosed 

5

container, a pocket, a purse, a briefcase, that that 

6

exhibits  that is an indication that people expect 

7

that the cell phone  that the information contained on 

8

their cell phone is private. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, as opposed to 

10

what?  Carrying it around somewhere other than your 

11

pocket?  I mean, do  do you think there's a difference 

12

if it's attached to someone's belt and everybody can see 

13

it or if it's in a pocket? 

14

 MS. MIZNER: 

No.  I believe that because you 

15

are carrying it with you, it is  it's not something 

16

that you are exhibiting to the public.  You're not 

17

exhibiting the contents of the phone to the public. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Surely it's more 

19

private if it's locked in your car or kept in your 

20

house. 

21

 MS. MIZNER: 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

23

in public makes it less private. 

24
25

 MS. MIZNER: 

Yes. 
Carrying it with you 

But you're not  it may be 

less private, but that doesn't mean that you don't have

Alderson Reporting Company

46
1

a reasonable expectation of privacy against people 

2

taking it from you and starting to intrude and  and 

3

rummage through its contents. 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you're not questioning 

5

the ability of the police to take the phone.  I thought 

6

that that was a given, that incident to the arrest, the 

7

police could take the phone.  The question is whether 

8

they can search it without a warrant. 

9

 MS. MIZNER: 

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  I was 

10

responding in terms of just a general expectation that 

11

people are not going to  if you  because you're 

12

carrying a phone in public, it doesn't mean that you 

13

expect that people are going to walk up and remove it 

14

from your belt or remove it from your pocket and start 

15

searching its contents. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

 to see whether or not. 
And why not the phone.

Alderson Reporting Company

47
1

That's exactly the question. 

2

 MS. MIZNER: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Because 
Do you have a reasonable 

4

our rule has been if you carry it on your person, you 

5

ought to know it is subject to seizure and examination, 

6

and that's been the rule. 

7

 MS. MIZNER: 

It's the scope of examination 

8

that we  that is at issue with a cell phone.  A cell 

9

phone is fundamentally different from a cigarette pack. 

10

You can open the cigarette pack, you see whether or not 

11

there is something that is subject to destruction.  But 

12

whether there's 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And you can open the cell 

14

phone and see whatever's in it.  So if you carry around 

15

a cell phone that isn't encrypted or whatever, you know, 

16

you  you  you get what you  what you should have 

17

expected.  That's  that's been the rule.  If you are 

18

arrested, we  we can seize it and examine it. 

19

 MS. MIZNER: 

The question is what is the 

20

scope of a permissible examination.  And when you're 

21

talking about a cigarette pack, you're looking at 

22

another physical object.  You're not looking at the 

23

contents of somebody's home. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I understand.  But you 

so you're arguing for a new rule.  The rule right up to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

now has been you can  we can seize it.  We can examine 

2

it totally.  If it's a book, we can read every page of 

3

the book.  You want a new rule for cell phones, right? 

4

 MS. MIZNER: 

We want a rule that says that 

5

you cannot search the contents of the cell phone without 

6

a warrant. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

 MS. MIZNER: 

9
10
11

At all?  At all? 
On  absent exigent 

circumstances. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What would be an exigent 

circumstance where you could search, in your view? 

12

 MS. MIZNER: 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

An exigent circumstance? 
You said you had  you 

14

are arguing for a flat rule to the police, thou shalt 

15

not unless there are exigent circumstances.  So what 

16

would be an exigent circumstance where the police, 

17

without getting a warrant, could search the cell phone? 

18

 MS. MIZNER: 

One would be an example of

20

potential bombing, and they have information that the 

21

that whoever is going to set off the bomb is going to

Just observation.  But 
You've observed different

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

they're in their pockets, right? 

22

That's probably true. 
Particularly since 

 Well, it  does  do you  is it 

23

insignificant, in your view, that the cell phone was a 

24

method for which criminal transactions were typically 

25

undertaken in this area and that the fellow had two cell

1

phones rather than what I would have thought is the more 

2

normal one? 

3

 MS. MIZNER: 

Yes.  I don't believe that that 

4

should be a criteria justification for searching either 

5

cell phone.  The  it may be convenient for the police 

6

to get information related to a crime by  by searching 

7

without a warrant, but this Court has said repeatedly 

8

that convenience and efficiency don't override 

9

individual constitutional rights. 

10

 And sanctioning a general evidence gathering 

11

search of the entire contents of his cell phone, given 

12

the current expansive nature of those contents is an 

13

unwarranted expansion of a traditional search incident 

14

to arrest, because we are not talking about the kind of 

15

traditional containers that holds limited, finite 

16

quantities of  of usually other objects. 

17

 And there is nothing  a seizeandsecure 

18

rule protects both the individuals' expectations of 

19

privacy and security and the government's right to 

20

obtain evidence consonant with the protections of the 

21

warrant requirement, giving the neutral magistrate an 

22

opportunity to determine whether there's probable cause 

23

for the search of the cell phone and to define the 

24

limits of that search.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

Mr. Dreeben, you

Official

have four minutes remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 A search incident to arrest has always been 

7

considered a reasonable search within the meaning of the 

8

Fourth Amendment, and I think this case illustrates why 

9

that principle well applies to a cell phone. 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

This is a very big 

11

confusion of the Fourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment 

12

doesn't permit reasonable searches without a warrant. 

13

It says you need a warrant for  we've created 

14

exceptions to that, but not because a search is 

15

reasonable.  Virtually every search could be reasonable 

16

without a warrant.  If you've watched somebody selling 

17

drugs, it's very reasonable to go into their house, but 

18

absent the exigent circumstance of the drugs 

19

disappearing, you can't.  So I don't talk about 

20

reasonable searches.  I talk about 

21

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So Justice Sotomayor, the 

22

Fourth Amendment doesn't actually say you do need a 

23

warrant.  It does protect the right against unreasonable 

24

seizures, and it describes what warrants must contain. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's the only thing it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1
2

prohibits is unreasonable seizures. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

That's exactly right.  That's 

3

the textual prohibition.  This Court has created 

4

language in its jurisprudence that prefers warrants in 

5

certain circumstances, but as the Court recognized in 

6

McNealey last term and in Maryland v. King, the search 

7

incident to arrest doctrine is a categorical exception 

8

and this case illustrates why. 

9

 The information that was found on the phone

was very time sensitive and important to law 

11

enforcement.  It helped fulfill the typical purposes, 

12

the categorical purposes of the search incident to 

13

arrest doctrine.  It helped verify identity, it helped 

14

solve the crime that  for which the individual was 

15

arrested, and it was done in a reasonable and 

16

nonintrusive manner.  There was nothing about this 

17

search that exposed reams of private data to view. 

18

 To the extent that the data was not in a 

19

call log really subject to a reasonable expectation of 

20

privacy at all, it was discovered in a search but I 

21

think that underscores why the search was limited and 

22

reasonable.  So this case really, I think, exemplifies 

23

why a categorical rule that respondent urges in this 

24

case would not be appropriate, and we submit that this 

25

Court should reverse the Court of Appeals.  Thank you.
