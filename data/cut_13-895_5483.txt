 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

in Case Number 13895, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus 

5

in Alabama  v. Alabama, and Case 131138, the Alabama 

6

Democratic Conference v. Alabama. 

7

 Mr. Pildes. 

8

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD PILDES 

9

 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS 

10

 MR. PILDES: 

11

please the Court: 

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Alabama employed rigid racial quotas, rigid 

13

racial targets to design all its black majority 

14

districts based on mere racial statistics alone, and 

15

then used only racial demographic data to meet those 

16

targets with astonishing precision.  These targets were 

17

not based on any consideration of what's required under 

18

current conditions in Alabama as Section 5 actually 

19

requires. 

20

 Racial quotas in the context of districting 

21

are a dangerous business.  They can be a way of giving 

22

minorities faced with racially polarized voting a fair 

23

opportunity to elect, but they can also be a way of 

24

unnecessarily packing voters by race in ways that 

25

further polarize and isolate us by race.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you want, on the 

2

one hand  they obviously had to move new voters into 

3

the majorityminority districts because they were all 

4

underpopulated, and they need to move enough so that the 

5

minorities have an opportunity to elect candidates of 

6

their choice, but they can't move too many because that 

7

would be packing, correct? 

8
9

 MR. PILDES: 

Your Honor, we understand that 

States are in a bind in this situation as has been true 

10

under Title VII and under the Voting Rights Act under 

11

Section 2. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So  but they have 

13

to do that.  They have to hit this sweet spot between 

14

those two extremes without taking race predominantly 

15

into consideration? 

16

 MR. PILDES: 

They don't have to hit a sweet 

17

pot  spot.  This Court has marked out a legitimate 

18

path that States can take and must take to comply both 

19

with their Section 5 obligations and with their equal 

20

protection obligations not to use the excessive and 

21

unjustified use of racial categories. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I thought the 

23

Section 5 obligation, gee, it  it used to require that 

24

there  that there be no regression in  in  in 

25

majority black districts.  So if a district went from 69

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

percent black to 55 percent black, you would be in 

2

trouble. 

3

 MR. PILDES: 

Your Honor, Section 5 has 

4

always required no retrogression based on the ability to 

5

elect under current conditions. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 MR. PILDES: 

8
9

Right. 
So if there's no racially 

polarized voting 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And  and they're saying 

10

that's all we did.  You know, these  these districts 

11

were underpopulated with respect to other ones, so we 

12

had to move new people in them, and we had to do it in 

13

such a way that there was still the 69 percent black 

14

population that they're used to be in order to avoid 

15

retrogression. 

16

 MR. PILDES: 

Your Honor, retrogression has 

17

never meant merely reproducing racial statistics purely 

18

for their own sake.  It's meant preserving the ability 

19

to elect, preserving majorityminority districts. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, you can say that, but 

21

it meant you're  the only way to be sure you're not 

22

doing that is maintaining the same  the same 

23

percentage.  And that's certainly the way the Justice 

24

Department, in the bad old days, used to interpret it. 

25

 MR. PILDES: 

It may be in the first decade

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or so of the application of Section 5, DOJ employed 

2

various kinds of practices as you describe.  As our 

3

brief documents in detail, the Department of Justice has 

4

routinely precleared plans that reduce black populations 

5

as long as they don't reduce the ability to elect. 

6

 And, indeed, in Alabama in the last round of 

7

redistricting, if you look at the blue brief of the 

8

Black Caucus at the chart at 8A, you will see that 

9

Alabama dramatically reduced black populations in all of 

10

its districts in the Senate and in virtually all of its 

11

districts in the House.  And if you look at that chart, 

12

you'll see numbers like a 12point reduction, a 19point 

13

reduction, a 10point reduction, 16point reduction. 

14
15
16
17
18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Why is that?  Why 

is 
 MR. PILDES: 

They reduced districts down to 

56 percent. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Why is that?  Why do 

19

you no longer need as high a percentage of minority 

20

voters to maintain a situation where minority voters can 

21

still elect their candidates of choice? 

22

 MR. PILDES: 

For the reasons that this Court 

23

adverted to in Shelby County and the reasons that 

24

Alabama rightly celebrates in its briefs.  Black turnout 

25

and black registration rates in Alabama now routinely

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

equal or even exceed white registration and white 

2

turnout rates. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You realize, I assume, that 

4

you're  you're making the argument that the opponents 

5

of black plaintiffs used to make here.  They  they 

6

they said, you know, by requiring packing of  of 

7

minorities into certain districts, you're reducing their 

8

influence statewide so you  the representatives in 

9

in other districts can ignore what  what  what the 

10

minority wants because they're all packed into  that's 

11

the argument the other side used to be making. 

12

 MR. PILDES: 

Yes, Your Honor.  And when the 

13

Voting Rights Act legitimately requires the use of race 

14

in the face of polarized voting, then there's a national 

15

political judgment that reflects the tradeoffs, the cost 

16

and the benefits, as there are, to designing these 

17

districts.  You can 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose  suppose there 

19

are Party A in 2001 takes minorities out of heavily 

20

minority districts and puts them into opportunity 

21

districts for political purposes.  It's for partisan 

22

gerrymandering purposes.  Assume that. 

23

 MR. PILDES: 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

Uhhuh. 
Party B then gets into 

power ten years later.  It wants to undo what Party A

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

did, and it puts them back into heavily populated 

2

districts.  Is there a violation when Party B does that? 

3

 MR. PILDES: 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

There's no 
And its  and its  and 

5

will stipulate that its motive is simply to help its 

6

partisan balance 

7

 MR. PILDES: 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9

 MR. PILDES: 

If they 
 or partisan imbalance. 
If they do not use racial 

10

classifications, if they do not use excessive racial 

11

means to do it 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, no, they  they do. 

13

They put minorities back into heavily packed districts, 

14

just as they took minorities out ten years before. 

15

 MR. PILDES: 

Right.  But the line this 

16

Court's precedents have drawn is precisely the line 

17

between partisan motivations in districting and racial. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

In both of my 

19

hypotheticals, it's partisan.  In either case, is there 

20

a violation? 

21
22
23

 MR. PILDES: 

If it's purely partisan in 

motive and they don't use race, then there's no problem. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, but  but they do use 

24

race, but it's purely partisan.  Your  the 

25

hypothetical is, Case 1, they find minority voters and

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

put them into minority opportunity districts, unpacking 

2

the very heavily minority populated districts.  Then the 

3

next party comes in and simply undoes it, and it uses 

4

the same calculus, race. 

5

 MR. PILDES: 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Your Honor, the 
Are you going to tell 

7

me  is it your position, and I think it may be your 

8

position, that in the first case it's permitted and the 

9

second case it isn't? 

10

 MR. PILDES: 

No, Your Honor.  Our position 

11

is that race can't be used excessively and unjustifiably 

12

in either case.  And the threejudge court found 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Was it unjust  was it 

14

unjustified in  in  in Case A when they were trying 

15

to have more minority opportunity districts? 

16

 MR. PILDES: 

If they exceeded their 

17

obligations under Section 2 and Section 5, if they went 

18

beyond the limited leeway this Court has said that 

19

States have, if they have the strong basis in evidence 

20

that's required, if they properly interpret the Act, 

21

that's the legitimate path States have that this Court 

22

has marked out. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Did they do this for 

partisan purposes? 
 MR. PILDES: 

Your Honor 

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And I'm asking if Party B 

2

can then undo it for partisan purposes, because I sense 

3

that there's a oneway ratchet here. 

4
5
6

 MR. PILDES: 

I don't think that's correct, 

Your Honor, and I understand the concern. 
 If, for partisan purposes, a legislature 

7

passed a racebased barrier to voting, that would surely 

8

be unconstitutional.  They can't use race in the way 

9

this Court's cases  in the Shaw line of cases indicate 

10

are beyond the parameters the States have.  They have to 

11

have a strong basis in evidence. 

12

 In this case, Alabama didn't even ask the 

13

relevant legal question.  Alabama didn't ask what is 

14

necessary to preserve the ability to elect, what might 

15

be necessary to preserve the ability to elect.  They 

16

just reproduced numbers, statistics, and the way they 

17

did it is they just used racial data. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, you began by  by 

19

criticizing Alabama for supposedly imposing quotas.  But 

20

listening to your argument, it sounds to me that you are 

21

just as interested in quotas.  You're just interested in 

22

lower quotas. 

23

 Justice Alito: Is that right? 

24

 MR. PILDES: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Your Honor, 
So if you  if they want to 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

keep it at 70 percent, that's  that may be

2

illegitimate in your view.  But if they take it down to 

3

the minimum that would be required in order to produce 

4

the desired result, that's a  that's a  a 

5

permissible quota.  So why are you using this term 

6

"quota" at all? 

7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15

 MR. PILDES: 

We don't have to use the word 

"quota." 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 
 MR. PILDES: 

Well, why did you use it? 
I actually meant to use the 

word "racial targets."  Judge Thompson used the word 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You think there's a 

difference between the two? 
 MR. PILDES: 

Well, there's a lot of 

rhetorical and inflammatory power in the word "quota." 

16

 But, Your Honor, the point here is that 

17

there must be at least legitimate basis for racial 

18

classification. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So that's to Justice 

20

Kennedy's question, I thought your answer would be there 

21

isn't a oneway ratchet.  That's Cromartie 2, isn't it? 

22

 MR. PILDES: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If you're using 
Doesn't Cromartie 2 say if 

24

you're doing this for political reasons, because many, 

25

many AfricanAmericans vote Democrat, all right?  And so 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what they're doing is they're trying to help the

2

Democrats.  So, yeah, we're trying to help the 

3

Democrats.  Okay. 

4

 If that's what you can  are doing and they 

5

can't really prove the contrary, the burden is on the 

6

one attacking the district, whether they are doing it by 

7

removing some AfricanAmericans from this one or by 

8

putting more into it, it's the same issue.  Am I right? 

9
10
11
12
13
14

 MR. PILDES: 

Yes, you're right.  And 

that's 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

oneway ratchet.  It is a twoway ratchet, which 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 MR. PILDES: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

And it's valid in both 

in both cases.  That's your problem. 

15

17

Right.  Then it's not a 

If 
That's not our case because 

our case, they don't try to defend on that ground. 
 MR. PILDES: 

Right.  And that's  your 

19

answer is exactly the answer I was trying to give to 

20

Justice Kennedy, which is partisan manipulation, this 

21

Court has said, may be fine and constitutional, but the 

22

one thing you cannot do is use race as a proxy for 

23

politics or political affiliation.  You cannot use 

24

racial targets that don't have a legitimate 

25

justification.  They're not tied to current conditions.

 MR. PILDES:

But now you're saying you 

5

cannot use race as a proxy for political affiliation, 

6

but that was his hypothetical 

7

 MR. PILDES: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

I thought 
 that these people were 

moved because blacks overwhelmingly vote Democrat. 

10

 MR. PILDES: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Your Honor 
You're saying that's bad if 

12

that's the reason they move them.  I don't think he 

13

thinks that's bad. 

14

 MR. PILDES: 

I understood Justice Breyer to 

15

be describing a situation in which you're moving 

16

people because they're Democrats.  You have voting 

17

behavior data.  You look at the data.  You move people 

18

based 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, you're moving them 

20

because they're black, and you think blacks will 

21

overwhelmingly vote Democrat.  That's why you're moving 

22

them, because they're black.  Because we assume blacks 

23

are overwhelmingly Democrats. 

24

 MR. PILDES: 

Your Honor, in this area, the 

Court has said that assumptions like that cannot be the

basis of the way district lines are drawn or the way

2

people are classified by race. 

3
4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Pildes, because 

because your time is running out 

5

 MR. PILDES: 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
 there is  in your 

7

presentation, you're saying we are attacking the 

8

statewide plan.  We are not picking one district or the 

9

other.  And you have been attacked on that point.  The 

10

attack is that Shaw claims have to be district by 

11

district; they can't be statewide.  So I would like your 

12

answer to that question.  There hasn't been a Shaw 

13

claim, as far as I know, that was statewide.  They have 

14

all been district by district. 

15

 MR. PILDES: 

Your Honor, our claim is that 

16

the exact same policy was applied in every black

17

majority district, which is we will use racial data to 

18

repopulate as close as we can possibly do it to the 

19

exact same black percentage.  That's a policy applied in 

20

every  in all 36 districts. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And how  how are your 

22

clients hurt by that?  It seems to me you have to come 

23

up with a client in one of the other districts that 

24

would have been, as you put it, more competitive had 

25

this packing not occurred.

Your Honor

 MR. PILDES: 

Your Honor, we  the record 

5

demonstrates that we have plaintiffs or we have members 

6

of the ADC in many of the black majority districts at 

7

issue, and that at least is sufficient for us to 

8

challenge this policy, at least as applied in those 

9

districts. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I thought the record just 

11

showed that you  you named your plaintiffs by county 

12

rather than district. 

13

 MR. PILDES: 

But many of the districts are 

14

wholly contained within the county.  They occupy the 

15

full county.  We demonstrate in our brief a number of 

16

senate districts and many house districts that are whole 

17

county districts. 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Are you waiving 

19

your district by district challenge?  Does your claim 

20

rise and fall solely on this statewide point you make? 

21

 MR. PILDES: 

By statewide, we simply mean a 

22

common policy applied to every district in the State.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 

3

 ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS 

4

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

5

it please the Court: 

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 This Court's Shaw jurisprudence channels the 

7

conversation that we're having today.  This Court has 

8

identified two constitutional claims that could be 

9

raised with regard to the use of race in districting. 

10

One is intentional dilution of minority votes for the 

11

purpose of minimizing their effectiveness and the second 

12

one is Shaw.  This is  we're advancing a Shaw claim. 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You lost on the dilution 

claim. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

We did.  We did.  The facts 

16

material to the Shaw claim are  were not in dispute at 

17

trial.  The question is whether they fall within the 

18

concept of predominance in this Court's line of 

19

decisions. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Did the district court 

21

understand you to be asserting a districtspecific 

22

districtspecific claims? 

23

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

24
25

I think it understood us to 

be challenging each of the districts. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Where  where do you find 

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that in the  in the opinion of the district court?  I

2

thought the district court interpreted you not to be 

3

making that claim. 

4

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I  we  we advanced 

5

evidence as to the motive that was a motive common to 

6

all the districts and then we advanced  offered 

7

evidence about particular districts to illustrate how 

8

that was played out.  But this is not  there's no 

9

conceptual difference between challenging all 36 

10

districts and challenging 36 districts.  It  it's the 

11

same claim. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you mean had specific 

13

 in your proposed findings, you dealt specifically 

14

with certain districts and not specifically with others. 

15

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

The specific information 

16

dealt with many of the particular districts, but the 

17

claim was that all of the districts were the result of a 

18

common purpose, that that common  and that common 

19

purpose race was the predominant and overriding 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But some of the districts 

21

were unchanged.  The percentage was exactly the same as 

22

it was before.  Those are the only districts that your 

23

clients were from.  How have they been harmed? 

24
25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Our  our clients  we 

have members in all the districts.  The theory of harm 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

in the Shaw line of cases 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Was that established in the 

3

district court, that you have members in all the 

4

districts? 

5

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

That was the finding of the 

6

district court.  The Alabama legislature  because this 

7

concerned the black districts 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The finding of the district 

court was that you have  you have members 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I think it said all or 

11

virtually all.  But that wasn't  our standing wasn't 

12

in dispute.  But the  the concept of injury in the 

13

Shaw line of cases is  is not injury to the 

14

individuals who were in the districts that are  become 

15

whiter because blacks are moved out.  That is  those 

16

are the people who don't have standing. 

17

 In Hays, this Court made clear it's the 

18

it's the individuals in the districts into which blacks 

19

are put for the predominant racial purpose of  for 

20

predominant racial purpose.  That's  that's the 

21

standing doctrine that this Court has announced in those 

22

cases. 

23

 Predominance involves, under this Court's 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

I don't understand what you 

just said.  They have a claim because there are too many 

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

blacks in their district?

2

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

No.  It's not about the 

3

number.  The theory of the Court in Shaw is that if race 

4

is the predominant purpose in putting blacks into a 

5

district, that that will likely result in 

6

representational harm in terms of the way the elected 

7

officials will act.  And that's been the theory of the 

8

Shaw claims ever since Shaw. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And you think it's 

10

possible for the State to navigate between not enough 

11

minority members in the district and too many minority 

12

members in the district without taking race into 

13

account. 

14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

16
17

No, we do  we do not. 
Race predominantly 

into account. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

But Shaw  Shaw doesn't say 

18

that taking race into account raises a constitutional 

19

question in all cases, particularly in  in the wake of 

20

this Court's decision in Easley, which made it clear, 

21

finally resolving an issue that had been kicking around 

22

for some time, that the fact that race was a factor in 

23

drawing a district doesn't trigger strict scrutiny.  A 

24

majority of the Court held there that for Shaw purposes 

25

to trigger strict scrutiny the plaintiff would have to 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

show predominance, that race was the predominant,

2

overriding purpose, meaning it was the criteria to which 

3

 that couldn't be put aside for any other purpose. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So  so they have 

5

to navigate between too many and too few, but without 

6

race being the predominant consideration. 

7

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

If race, if  in terms of 

8

the Constitution, if race isn't the predominant purpose 

9

and dilution isn't involved, then there's no 

10

constitutional claim.  With regard to Section 5, let 

11

me  I think it would be helpful to understand what the 

12

government's interpretation is and has been for sometime 

13

about what Section 5 requires.  This is reflected in the 

14

government's brief at 22 and 23 and in the 2011 

15

guidelines. 

16

 The government's view, and this is how 

17

this has long been understood, is that the black 

18

proportion can be reduced to the point where blacks no 

19

longer have the  the ability to elect a candidate of 

20

their choice.  Until you get to that point, changes are 

21

not retrogressive, and that's not the way 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do you think  what 

23

do you think  well, it's speculative.  But I think 

24

that if Alabama had reduced the number of minority 

25

voters in majorityminority districts in any significant 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

way, the Attorney General would have come down on them

2

like a ton of bricks.

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

That  that is not correct, 

Your Honor. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

He did preclear the 

plan that you're challenging today. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

He also precleared the 2001 

8

plan which did precisely what you described.  The  the 

9

government's view of this is set out in some greater 

10

detail in their brief in Georgia v. Ashcroft and in 

11

the  in the oral argument of Mr. Stewart at the time. 

12

As they explained then, and this remains their view, and 

13

consistent with the way the Department has operated, 

14

until  the numbers can fall until it gets to the point 

15

where the ability to elect is in question.  The 

16
17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can  can I just go back to your ShawnonShaw? 

18

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20

I have a problem. 

Yes. 
Basically, you're saying 

I don't have a Shaw challenge. 

21

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I have a Shaw challenge. 
All right.  You're 

23

claiming it's a Shaw challenge, but you don't have to 

24

describe the injury.  It's a  it's an ephemeral 

25

injury; race played a part in the overall plan, without 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an effect in a particular district.

2

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

No, no. 
If a particular 

district 

5

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No. 
I mean, if it stayed 

7

essentially the same, they didn't move the boundaries 

8

much, they obviously  they don't  it's an allwhite 

9

district.  If they moved the boundaries, it wasn't to 

10

include more blacks or anything else.  It was just 

11

because of  of geographic divisions.  So explain to me 

12

why you don't have to prove that you were harmed 

13

specifically by the application of this policy. 

14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Let me say two things in 

15

response to that.  First, the  the theory of Shaw is 

16

that if black voters are, for a predominantly racial 

17

reason, moved into a district, not just leave it alone, 

18

moved into a district for predominantly racial reasons, 

19

that would strict scrutiny.  Now 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that wasn't true 

any 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Yes, it is.  Yes, it is, 

23

Your Honor.  When one of the member of the court said 

24

the districts hadn't changed, I think what he meant was 

25

that the black percentage hadn't changed.  All of these 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

districts changed.  They were underpopulated by on

2

average about 15 percent.  There's an average of 6,000 

3

voters, individuals, put in every house district, 20,000 

4

in every senate district. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, explain  now that 

6

you're talking about districts, could I come back to the 

7

question I asked at the beginning, so that I understand 

8

what we have to decide.  On page 128 of the Joint 

9

Appendix, there's a paragraph in the district court 

10

opinion that explains what the district court understood 

11

to be  to be before it on the issue of intentional 

12

discrimination.  I see nowhere any indication that the 

13

district court construed your pleadings and your other 

14

submissions to raise a claim about any specific 

15

district. 

16

 The third point is we construe the filings 

17

of the Democratic Conference plaintiffs as arguing that 

18

certain senate districts constitute racial gerrymanders. 

19

There's nothing with that with respect to your client. 

20

Maybe I'm missing something.  So if that's how the 

21

district court understood your position, then maybe it 

22

was wrong, but that would be the threshold question we'd 

23

have to decide, wouldn't it be, that if you have to be 

24

districtspecific, we would have to say the district 

25

court misunderstood the claims that you were asserting? 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I think in the context of

2

the way the case was litigated and tried and the briefs 

3

at the time, it was  everybody understood the 

4

plaintiffs were challenging all of the majorityblack 

5

districts. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The district court 

7

understood that?  Then why did it include this paragraph 

8

and why did it not go through any districts that it saw 

9

you as challenging?  It went through some that it saw 

10

the other plaintiffs as challenging, none with respect 

11

to you. 

12

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

We think in the context in 

13

which the case was litigated, there was no conceptual 

14

difference between challenging all the 36 districts and 

15

challenging 36 individual districts.  The reason the 

16

opinion reads the way it does is that the State didn't 

17

contend and we didn't contend that there was different 

18

districtspecific purposes afoot.  The State's account 

19

of this, which everyone accepted, was that the State had 

20

a common purpose in adding those thousands of 

21

individuals to each district, which was to  which was 

22

to continue the black percentage as it had been all 

23

along.  It was a purpose common to all of them. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And, Mr. Schnapper, isn't it 

right that after trial, when you submitted proposed 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

findings of fact and conclusions of law, in fact, you

2

did reference particular districts?  You referenced 

3

Senate Districts 18, 19 and 20.  In another place, you 

4

talked about all the majorityblack districts in the 

5

State's black belt, and you explained how your theory of 

6

the case related to each one of those districts. 

7

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

We did.  This  this is 

8

somewhat analogous to the Teamsters decision from back 

9

in the 1970s.  Where the government to prove racial 

10

discrimination in promotions, said it made out a pattern 

11

and practice case by offering evidence that was classwide, 

12

that affected all the individual blacks and Hispanics, 

13

and then offered some individual stories.  But the claim 

14

was for all of the individuals who worked in those  in 

15

those facilities. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

To get there, we'd have 

17

you're talking, about, second, we construe the filings 

18

of the Black Caucus plaintiffs as arguing that the acts 

19

as a whole constitute racial gerrymandering, so we'd 

20

have to say that was wrong, they didn't get the 

21

complaint right, send it back. 

22

 So if we're going to have to send it back, I 

23

guess what you'd have to  would there be anything 

24

wrong with saying this:  Look, tell the plaintiffs 

25

please to point district by district to the fact that 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the primary motive here was racial.  I don't think that

2

would be too hard.  We have loads of evidence on that. 

3

 Now, if the primary is racial  and this is 

4

the crucial part  they then to justify this have to 

5

show that they are making a  and I don't know what 

6

word  reasonable attempt, good faith reasonable 

7

attempt, some other word, to comply with the section, 

8

old Section 5 requirements, with the Section 5 

9

requirements.  And now they have to do it over again 

10

anyway and so they do it over again, and if in fact some 

11

of the questions suggest that that is what they were 

12

trying to do; and you'd have evidence there that said, 

13

no, no, that isn't what they were trying to do.  They 

14

didn't even read the guidelines of the attorney general. 

15

They didn't even look at what happened in the past. 

16

They made no such attempt.  All right.  So would there 

17

be, from your point of view, anything wrong with that 

18

holding? 

19

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, Your Honor, I think 

20

with regard to the question of justification, we think 

21

it doesn't make any sense, in light of this Court's 

22

decision particularly in Shaw 2, to send it back.  The 

23

Court's decision makes clear that there are three 

24

parameters to the way you assess this:  First, what they 

25

did is to be judged by the correct interpretation of the 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute, not what they might have thought in good faith

2

it meant.  Second  and the word "correct" is in a 

3

number of this Court's Shaw decisions. 

4

 Secondly, that the purpose to comply with 

5

the correct interpretation has to have been their motive 

6

at the time; and secondly, at the time, not at trial, 

7

but back when they did this, they had to then, in 2012, 

8

have had a strong basis in evidence for concluding that 

9

not using all these different numbers would have 

10

violated the statute.  They don't  they can't satisfy 

11

any of those things.  They can't go back  you could 

12

send the case back to the district court, but you can't 

13

send the case back to 2012 and have them change the 

14

purpose or change the evidence before them. 

15

 So, unless you're going to change the 

16

standard of strict scrutiny this Court has applied in 

17

Shaw and other affirmative actionrelated cases, you 

18

could not do that.  It's just  it's years too late for 

19

them to solve those problems. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm still having a 

21

psychological problem with your point.  There were three 

22

reasons.  You're saying merely because it was one among 

23

the three, it necessarily was predominant as to each 

24

district created.  The example or hypothetical I posited 

25

for you was the primary reason above all others that 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they said is the 2 percent district, and there may be

2

 districts among these 36 that, as I indicated, had 

3

 contiguous populations that didn't make a difference 

4

 about race.  So it didn't  they are not affected by 

5

 this policy.  Why should we undo that? 

6

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Okay.  Okay.  If I might just 

7

 answer the one last question.  In fact, as the 

8

 analysis of the precinctsplitting shows, with perhaps 

9

 two exceptions, there is racebased precinctsplitting 

10

 on the border of every one of the majorityblack 

11

 districts in question here.  It wasn't a situation where 

12

 they just took the neighboring districts and they turned 

13

 out to replicate, to be just the ratio that they wanted. 

14

 It was very, very calculated and racebased.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 

18

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 

19
20
21
22

 SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and 

 may it please the Court: 
 The key point in this case is that Shaw 

23

 claims require districtspecific analysis.  The district 

24

 court departed from that principle and in our judgment 

25

 the plaintiffs' main theory also departs from that 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 principle, and I'd like to address 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I don't understand why 

3

 that's so, General.  I mean, what the plaintiffs are 

4

 saying is yes, we have common evidence, not all together 

5

 usual in a Shaw claim, but here they have evidence. 

6

 It's a policy statement that retrogression was going to 

7

 be a very main priority.  I think it was number 2.  And 

8

 retrogression was defined in a certain way, as requiring 

9

 the maintenance of black voting population.  And that 

10

 was going to be taken into account in every single 

11

 majority minority district. 

12

 Now, the fact that there's evidence, the 

13

 principal evidence in the case, that relates to every 

14

 single district and so in a sense the evidence is 

15

 statewide, does not make it any less a district by 

16

 district case. 

17

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

That may be right, 

18

 Justice Kagan, but it also doesn't prove that race 

19

 predominated in the Shaw sense with respect to each 

20

 specific district, and let me try to explain why.  The 

21

 test under Shaw is whether race predominates to the 

22

 derogation of traditional districting criteria.  And so 

23

 it may be that in some districts, the effort to maintain 

24

 the same African American population resulted in 

25

 judgments that  to draw the districts in ways that 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 derogated from traditional districting criteria, such as

2

 compactness and maintaining communities of interest, but 

3

 it may be in other districts that it didn't, and I can 

4

 provide specific examples of that. 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I guess I would 

6

 appreciate specific examples, because it seems to me as 

7

 sort of a goingin matter that when you say this is the 

8

 most important thing except for the Reynolds inquiry, 

9

 this is the most important thing, that necessarily it's 

10

 going to affect the way you redraw or who you put into 

11

 the districts. 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well 
You might not reach the 

14

 target in every single district, but necessarily you're 

15

 saying we are prioritizing this racebased  this 

16

 racebased thing, criterion, in a way that's going to 

17

 affect every judgment we make. 

18

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But the question under 

19

 Shaw, Your Honor, as we read the Shaw line of cases, is 

20

 whether that is done in derogation of traditional 

21

 districting criteria. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, how can it not be?  If 

23

 you have three priorities or three criteria and you say 

24

 this is the absolute most important criteria, it's just 

25

 the natural effect of that is going to be to minimize 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the other two criteria.

2

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, that's not 

3

 necessarily true.  Sometimes they will conflict, 

4

 sometimes they won't.  And I think the example  I can 

5

 give you examples I think that would illustrate that 

6

 from the record. 

7

 For example  now, there weren't specific 

8

 findings about these districts in the district court's 

9

 opinion, so I'm not trying to say this is what the 

10

 district court found.  But with respect to some 

11

 districts, for example, House District 67, the State 

12

 argues that that was a district in which you are going 

13

 to have essentially an African American percentage at 

14

 the percentage that the district was drawn at no matter 

15

 how you drew it, and that was because the surrounding 

16

 populations around that district were all of comparable 

17

 African American percentages.  So whatever choice you 

18

 made in order to get to the 2 percent 

19

 onepersononevote threshold was going to involve 

20

 moving African Americans.  And we'd submit that's not a 

21

 situation in which race predominated over traditional 

22

 districting criteria.  It's a  it's situation in which 

23

 traditional districting criteria drove the decision. 

24
25

 There may, however, be other districts 
 and Senate District 26 is one that comes to mind, in 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 which, where you had this movement of 14,500 people into


2


 a district, which was in the City of Montgomery and 


3


 surrounding areas, all but 35 of whom were African 


4


 American.  And if one looks at that map  and actually, 


5


 it's very difficult to discern on the small maps that 


6


 are in your materials.  But if you can get a blowup of 

7

 it, what you will see in that map is that the socalled 

8

 "crab claws" that the parties describe that extend out 

9

 from the district capture African American populations. 

10

 But what they do is carve out the white part of the City of 

11

 Montgomery and attach it by a very narrow land bridge to 

12

 the next 

13
14
15
16

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose they did that 

 based on economic data? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Then I think it would not 

 be a problem, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But it results in the same 

 thing. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Right.  But it wouldn't 

20

  it wouldn't be race predominating over traditional 

21

 districting criteria.  And I will go back and try to 

22

 answer the question that Your Honor posed earlier about 

23

 when partisanship can be a justification and when it 

24

 isn't.  I think it's a very technical answer, but I 

25

 think if a State were to move electoral precincts from 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 one district to another, the entire electoral precinct,

2

 because there you would have the data on how people 

3

 voted in that precinct, that would  that would not 

4

 raise a problem under the Shaw analysis because you 

5

 clearly would be making a decision for partisan reasons. 

6

 But when you split a precinct and you move 

7

 just based on census block information, there you don't 

8

 know how the people in the census block voted.  What you 

9

 know is their race.  And so at that point if you're 

10

 using race as a proxy  and I think that's what 

11

 Mr. Pildes was trying to describe to Your Honor, when 

12

 you're using race as a proxy in that circumstance, that 

13

 would violate what this Court has said in all of its 

14

 Shaw cases is the constitutional norm at stake here 

15

 because you're making an assumption.  You're 

16

 stereotyping in that situation, so it's 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And that's true at the 

18

 outset if you move them by race in order to increase 

19

 their capacity to influence districts? 

20

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, that's a difficult 

21

 question, Your Honor, but I think if you're  if you're 

22

  if you're moving people by race in order to ensure 

23

 that you're not violating the Voting Rights Act that 

24

 seems to be one thing. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But then it's a oneway 

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 ratchet.
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, I don't think it is a 

3

 oneway ratchet, Your Honor, because you can move in 

4

 both directions, just move precincts and not  and not 

5

 census blocks. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

General, you say that the 

7

 district court erred in addressing the claim of racial 

8

 gerrymandering on a statewide rather than a 

9

 districtspecific basis.  I would assume that that was 

10

 an error on the part of the district court only if a 

11

 districtspecific claim was asserted by the plaintiffs, 

12

 but you don't address that issue. 

13

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes.  I'm happy to 

14

 address it now, Your Honor.  I actually think this is 

15

 quite a murky question.  I think, Your Honor  we agree 

16

 Your Honor is quite right that the district court did 

17

 appear, and JSA 128 is the place where it seems clear 

18

 that they did to appear, to assume that this was a 

19

 statewide claim.  In some respects, one can understand 

20

 why, because the basic theory is that the motive 

21

 influenced every district and it did adjudicate the case 

22

 on that basis. 

23

 So it would seem to me that one outcome here 

24

 would be to say that Shaw  the proper understanding of 

25

 Shaw is that claims have to be made on a 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 districtspecific basis and that the plaintiffs here

2

 didn't  didn't propound cognizable claims under Shaw 

3

 and that would be one resolution here.  But I have to 

4

 say, the record is somewhat murky on this.  Judge 

5

 Thompson in dissent did say that he thought that the 

6

 claims were districtbydistrict specific.  Justice 

7

 Kagan has identified some information in the record.  So 

8

 another option might be to articulate the correct 

9

 districtspecific standard and leave it to the district 

10

 court on remand to sort out whether the plaintiff has 

11

 his facts 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But you don't deny that a 

13

 statewide policy can refer to every district or every 

14

 majority minority district in the State? 

15

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No.  No, we don't deny 

16

 that, but that's not enough  our point is that's not 

17

 enough to trigger strict scrutiny.  You have to look and 

18

 see whether it's implemented in a manner that is in 

19

 derogation of traditional districting criteria district 

20

 by district. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But again  and I don't 

22

 want to press it if you've given me your best answer to 

23

 it  if a policy says we're going to prioritize this 

24

 particular criterion, which here was the mistaken 

25

 understanding of retrogression, if a policy says, we're 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 going to prioritize this over everything else, it seems

2

 to me that that's pretty good evidence of a violation. 

3

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Only if again  I guess 

4

 I am just going to repeat myself, but if it's in 

5

 derogation of traditional districting criteria 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But if the policy says that 

7

 it's going to prioritize it over everything else, that 

8

 means it going to be in derogation of tradition 

9

 districting criteria. 

10

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

When they conflict 
Sometimes they might fail. 

12

 Sometimes you're not going to be able to prioritize it 

13

 over everything else, but the intent is still to 

14

 prioritize it over everything else. 

15

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But the question is 

16

 let me take a step back because I think it might help to 

17

 put it in this context. 

18

 A challenge, a Shaw challenge, is a 

19

 challenge to a facially neutral government action.  The 

20

 lines on the map are what are being challenged here. 

21

 That's the government action.  Those lines are facially 

22

 neutral.  They may, in fact, reflect a violation of the 

23

 Constitution under Shaw if race predominated in the 

24

 placement of those lines in derogation of traditional 

25

 districting criteria.  But that's what you've got to 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 prove, and the mere existence of this motive doesn't

2

 prove it for each district, and that's our point. 

3

 If I could, I just would like to raise one 

4

 point in my remaining time going back to the question of 

5

 what Section 5 retrogression required.  Mr. Chief 

6

 Justice, you asked that question. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And when you do that, 

8

 will you also tell us what effect, if any, the 

9

 preclearance should have. 

10

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes.  So  and the two 

11

 are quite related.  I think Professor Pildes referred 

12

 you to this chart, but the key thing is to look at not 

13

 the difference between 2001 and the current plan, but 

14

 the difference between the 1993 plan and the 2001 plan. 

15

 The Justice Department cleared the 2001 plan 

16

 that Alabama submitted, and you will see for every 

17

 single district listed there, with maybe one exception, 

18

 there were significant reductions in the minority 

19

 percentages in those districts.  So Alabama knew 

20

 perfectly well that it was completely consistent with 

21

 its obligations under Section 5 to reduce the districts. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You asked for a 

23

 remand.  The result of the remand may well be Alabama 

24

 has to redistrict; is that right? 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yes. 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And when they do so,

 that would not be subject to Section 5, correct? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Certainly correct. 

 That's certainly correct. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And that's not a 

 concern for you? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, it's not a concern 

8

 for us.  It is what it is, Mr. Chief Justice.  If on 

9

 remand the district court concludes that some of these 

10

 districts violated the Constitution, then Alabama will 

11

 have to  the legislature will get its first chance to 

12

 a legislate a fix and Section 5 won't be a basis for 

13

 them to take any action.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. BRASHER

20

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 
 MR. BRASHER: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

 and may it please the Court: 
 I think the Court should begin with the 

21

 district court's factfinding, because the district 

22

 court expressly found that race did not predominate and 

23

 the Court can affirm on that basis and avoid addressing 

24

 questions about Section 5 and redistricting that are 

25

 unlikely to arise again because of this Court's decision 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 in Shelby County.
 On page 144 of the jurisdictional statement 

3

 appendix, the district court expressly found that we did 

4

 not impose a quota.  The court said that we imposed, 

5

 quote, "no brightline rule," and what the court meant 

6

 is that we preserved the core of existing districts, we 

7

 followed preexisting district lines, we followed roads, 

8

 we followed county lines, municipal lines, we met the 

9

 needs of incumbents, and we preserved communities of 

10
11

 interest. 
 The plan that we proposed  the plan that 

12

 we passed is a status quo plan.  The whole point of this 

13

 plan was to preserve the status quo because the 

14

 Republican Party had won a majority in the legislature 

15

 for first time in 130 years. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But the other side 

17

 says it was impermissible for you to preserve the status 

18

 quo because the opportunity for minority voters in the 

19

 majority minority districts to participate in the 

20

 electoral process had improved to the extent that 

21

 maintaining the status quo would be characterized as 

22

 packing. 

23

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, actually, if you look 

24

 at  well, two responses to that, Your Honor.  The 

25

 first is that if you look at the amicus brief filed in 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 support of neither party by political scientists, they

2

 show that black voter turnout and white voter turnout 

3

 and registration actually equalized in 1998.  So  so 

4

 there actually isn't some difference between the 

5

 districts in 2010 and  and the new ones that we 

6

 propose with respect to those criteria. 

7

 The second point, I guess, I would make to 

8

 that is that our  our redistricting criteria  our 

9

 nonracial redistricting criteria were coextensive with 

10

 the objective here to preserve these majorityblack 

11

 districts as they have been.  And what I mean is that 

12

 the objective of these nonracial redistricting criteria 

13

 was to preserve the status quo.  And so I think that's 

14

 what the United States Solicitor General was getting at, 

15

 is that it's difficult to disentangle the notion that we 

16

 should preserve the status quo with the majorityblack 

17

 districts. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is  is it fair to  to 

19

 read the pleadings and  and the submissions in this 

20

 case as saying that the State did not defend this plan 

21

 on the basis that it was for partisan purposes, but that 

22

 it was to comply with Section 5? 

23

 MR. BRASHER: 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

I don't 
Is that  is that a fair 

 reading of the  A, of the red brief and, B, of what 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 the district court found?
 MR. BRASHER: 

I don't think it's a fair 

3

 reading of either, Your Honor, and this is the reason 

4

 why.  Certainly, with respect to specific districts 

5

 here, when they were actually challenged, we were able 

6

 to respond and say this was for partisan political 

7

 reasons.  One of those districts, for example, was 

8

 Senate District 11, which was specifically challenged by 

9

 the Alabama Democratic Conference, and the district 

10

 court held that the changes to that district were based 

11

 on politics. 

12

 Now, with respect to the plan as a whole, 

13

 our response has always been that there is a lot of 

14

 factors that went into drawing the plan as a whole and 

15

 when it's drawing any specific district.  And I think 

16

 it's important here that the Plaintiffs have never 

17

 proposed a redistricting plan that actually meets our 

18

 raceneutral redistricting criteria, especially the 

19

 2 percent deviation in population that the legislature 

20

 adopted.  And I think that's important for three 

21

 reasons. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Are you really saying that 

23

 that's a pleading requirement, that they have to come in 

24

 with a plan that meets all the rest of your criteria? 

25

 MR. BRASHER: 

I do not believe that is a 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 pleading requirement.  I believe it's an evidentiary

2

 issue and I think the Court held that much in Cromartie. 

3

 And I think it's important for three reasons.  First, 

4

 the legislature adopted that 2 percent deviation to end 

5

 the previous partisan gerrymander that the Democrats 

6

 adopted in 2001, where they systematically 

7

 underpopulated majorityblack districts and 

8

 overpopulated majoritywhite districts in Republican 

9

 areas of the State, and that's why the Plaintiff's 

10

 brought a partisan gerrymandering claim in the district 

11

 court below. 

12

 And the second reason is what I was alluding 

13

 to earlier, and that's in Easley v. Cromartie, the Court 

14

 held that the first step of a racial gerrymandering 

15

 claim is to show that there's some conceivable way to do 

16

 this differently that creates greater racial balance. 

17

 And the facts that they  they've never produced a plan 

18

 that actually does that is a serious problem.  And that 

19

 makes sense, because if you want to see if race was 

20

 predominant in redistricting, you take race out and then 

21

 you run it again and you see what happens. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Brasher, I mean, let me 

23

 just give you some numbers here from  from some of 

24

 these districts.  Right?  HD 52, you needed to add 1145 

25

 African Americans in order to maintain the percentage of 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 AfricanAmerican voters, which was your number 2

2

 criterion.  You added 1143.  You missed by 2.  HD 55, 

3

 you needed to add 6981.  You added 6994.  SD 23, 15,069. 

4

 You hit at 15,185. 

5

 I mean, those numbers speak for themselves, 

6

 don't they?  That in each of these cases, you were 

7

 determined, come what may and disregarding other 

8

 criteria, to maintain the black voting age population. 

9

 MR. BRASHER: 

I don't think that shows that 

10

 for two reasons.  First, I agree with the United States 

11

 Solicitor General that the question here is whether we 

12

 subordinated raceneutral redistricting criteria to hit 

13

 these targets. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

15

 MR. BRASHER: 

That was just a coincidence? 
No.  But that goes to my 

16

 second point, is those House districts that you were 

17

 reading off are in the City of Birmingham.  The City of 

18

 Birmingham has over 200,000 people in it, 73 percent 

19

 black. 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, it's 73 percent, and 

 you hit that 73 percent exactly. 
 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, and that's my point. 

23

 There are at least going to be some of those House 

24

 districts in Birmingham that are 73 percent black and I 

25

 do not believe that in a place where there's more than 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 200,000 people and 73 percent of them are black you need

2

 to subordinate raceneutral redistricting criteria to 

3

 draw a 73 percent black district. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I think you kind of do 

5

 actually, because, I mean, you're trying to repopulate 

6

 these districts, and many of these districts, yes, there 

7

 are many, many, many African Americans.  But as you just 

8

 suggested, there are also white people.  And you did it 

9

 so that you, you know, completely replicated the exact 

10
11

 percentage figure. 
 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, I'll give you another 

12

 example of what I mean.  House District 67, which we 

13

 talk about in our briefs, is a singlecounty district. 

14

 It's always been a singlecounty district.  It's a 

15

 singlecounty district in our plan, and it's a 

16

 singlecounty district in every plan that the Plaintiffs 

17

 propose.  And it's always going to be 70 percent black 

18

 because that county is 70 percent black. 

19

 And I think the same thing could be said 

20

 about many of the neighborhoods in Birmingham, is that 

21

 these neighborhoods are 73 percent black and that's how 

22

 we hit the numbers.  And they certainly haven't proven 

23

 otherwise. 

24
25

 I also think that the 2 percent  the 
 failure to propose a 2 percent plan is important because 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 a 10 percent plan, the plans that they actually have

2

 proposed, are drastically different from a 2 percent 

3

 plan.  It's like comparing a plan with 100 districts to 

4

 one with only 80 districts.  Their Senate districts can 

5

 vary by 14,000 people, and ours can only vary by around 

6

 2,000 people. 

7

 And  but even though these  these plans 

8

 are drastically different with respect to the criteria 

9

 that the legislature adopted here, many of their 

10

 districts have exactly the same black population 

11

 percentage as our districts.  This is clearest if you 

12

 look at on page 36 of our brief where we lay out the 

13

 Senate districts and their own proposed plans next to 

14

 the Senate districts and our proposed plan.  And you'll 

15

 look and you'll see Senate District 18, 19, 20, some of 

16

 the Senate districts that Justice Kagan was talking 

17

 about earlier, are almost exactly the same in all three 

18

 plans. 

19

 If you look at Senate District 33, it's 

20

 exactly the same in our plan and in the Black Caucus's 

21

 proposed plan.  The evidence was that the only way you 

22

 could draw Senate District 33 with a different black 

23

 population percentage 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What about District 

 Senate District 26? 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BRASHER: 

Senate District 26 was above

2

 70 percent black in the previous plan and it's above 

3

 70 percent black in our plan and in the Black Caucus's 

4

 plan.  Now, it's not exactly on target, but the 

5

 Plaintiffs testified in this case that the area of 

6

 Montgomery City that we're talking about here is 

7

 99 percent black. 

8

 And because that was one of the Senate 

9

 districts that they actually challenged, we have 

10

 actually goodfaith credibility determination from the 

11

 trial court because the drafters actually testified 

12

 about why they made the changes to Senate District 26 

13

 they made, and they said that because of the way 

14

 populations shifted, they had to change an adjoining 

15

 district, Senate District 30, which required changes 

16

 to  to all of the rest of the districts.  And that 

17

 left a county, sort of an orphan county, Crenshaw 

18

 County, that is a rural county south of Montgomery. 

19

 They explained that what they did is they took part of 

20

 Senate  former Senate District 26, took it out to make 

21

 a way to connect the rural Crenshaw County to the rest 

22

 of Senate District 25, which is already predominantly 

23

 rural. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, the Solicitor General 

 just said that if you look at that district, it has a 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 very bizarre shape and the effect of the bizarre shape

2

 is to pull in predominantly AfricanAmerican areas and 

3

 exclude predominantly white areas.  Is he correct on 

4

 that? 

5

 MR. BRASHER: 

Actually, I respectfully 

6

 disagree with him about that.  I  if you look at the 

7

 comparison map, it's in the Joint Appendix on 197, you 

8

 can see a comparison between the former district and the 

9

 current district.  And what you'll see is up at the 

10

 right  I'm sorry, the  let me try and orient 

11

 myself  the left  the left part of Montgomery 

12

 County, that's where the former district used to be.  It 

13

 was part of Senate District 25 that came into the middle 

14

 of that district, sort of a  kind of came in the 

15

 middle of it.  And what the drafters did here is they 

16

 drew the lines closer to the City of Montgomery, and 

17

 they preserved that part of Senate District 25 that came 

18

 in the middle of it.  What they  the only thing they 

19

 did is they took some precincts and some parts of 

20

 precincts, kind of along those lines, and they moved 

21

 them from Senate District 25 to Senate District 26. 

22

 And I want to also just correct something 

23

 that the  my friend the Solicitor General said.  We 

24

 didn't just move black voters into that district.  We 

25

 also moved Hispanic voters into that district, we moved 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 white voters into that district.  We made changes to

2

 that 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr.  Mr. Brasher, I mean, 

4

 usually in these cases you're looking at these 

5

 funnyshaped districts and you're trying to figure out 

6

 from the shape and from other matters whether race has 

7

 been used instead of traditional districting criteria. 

8

 But this is a very sort  you know, sort of sui generis 

9

 Shaw claim, because here the principal evidence in the 

10

 case is not all the circumstantial stuff that we usually 

11

 do.  It's a policy statement from the State that says 

12

 race nonretrogression is going to be our principal 

13

 criterion except for Reynolds, and then a clear 

14

 testimony from the people who were applying that policy 

15

 statement that they thought that that meant maintaining 

16

 the black voting age population, something which is a 

17

 mistaken understanding of what retrogression entails. 

18

 But, you know, you don't have to look at all 

19

 the circumstantial evidence about the shape of districts 

20

 when you have a policy statement from the State saying 

21

 this is our number one criterion except for Reynolds and 

22

 this is how we understand it in such a way that it's 

23

 going to ensure that a 68 percent district stays a 

24

 68 percent district and a 52 percent district stays a 

25

 52 percent district and so on. 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, just two quick responses

2

 to that, Justice Kagan.  And the first is that the State 

3

 is always going to say that complying with Federal law 

4

 was a top priority because Federal law is supreme.  And 

5

 so if simply 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But this is much more than 

7

 that.  This is very specific saying where the  the 

8

 the two legislators principally in charge of this said 

9

 this is what we understand the requirements are, that 

10

 we're going to maintain the black voting age population 

11

 in each district. 

12

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, that brings me to my 

13

 second point, which is that imagine had we done the same 

14

 thing that the plaintiffs are suggesting, and we had 

15

 hired a political scientist to tell us that 55 percent 

16

 should be the target.  I don't think that we could say 

17

 race predominated in that circumstance, just because we 

18

 had a different target.  And so I think they are 

19

 bringing effectively a circumstantial case here.  They 

20

 have the fact that we said that this was our objective 

21

 under Section 5 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, Justice Kagan's 

23

 question points up the fact that the defenders of this 

24

 plan did not rely on the fact that it was a political 

25

 gerrymander and, of course, they said it was the 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 2 percent call, but the basis was race in order to

2

 comply with Section 5. 

3

 MR. BRASHER: 

And my point about that is 

4

 certainly with respect to specific districts, they were 

5

 based on partisanship, and so had they challenged 

6

 specific districts, we would have responded in kind with 

7

 respect to those specific districts.  But they never 

8

 challenged specific districts below. 

9

 And I think to answer Justice Alito's 

10

 question, to my friends on the other side, I think you 

11

 should look at document 194 which is the Black Caucus' 

12

 posttrial brief.  And although they certainly mention an 

13

 occasional specific district, they didn't have any 

14

 evidence.  I guess this goes back to Justice Kagan's 

15

 question.  This is a circumstantial case because the 

16

 only evidence 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought that there was 

 considerable evidence on Senate District 26. 
 MR. BRASHER: 

Senate District 26 was 

20

 challenged by the Alabama Democratic Conference, which 

21

 has now not brought a Shaw claim with respect to 

22

 district 26.  And because they specifically challenged 

23

 that district, you actually have, like I said, a 

24

 credibility determination by the district court about 

25

 the testimony with respect to that specific district. 

51

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Let me ask you about this

2

 Section 5 mistake.  Isn't it so that both the district 

3

 court and Alabama were laboring under the impression 

4

 that retrogression meant you have to keep the same 

5

 numbers? 

6

 MR. BRASHER: 

The district court made an 

7

 express factfinding here that our goal was to prevent 

8

 substantial reductions in black population in the 

9

 preexisting majority black districts. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And if that's a 

11

 misunderstanding of what Section 5 requires, then the 

12

 whole thing is infected by that mistake. 

13

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, I disagree with you 

14

 respectfully about it being a misunderstanding, because 

15

 I think in 2006, Congress told us that we could not 

16

 diminish the ability to elect a black voters in a 

17

 preexisting majority black district. 

18

 My friend, Professor Pildes, testified 

19

 against the inclusion of that language in Congress, and 

20

 he told them that if they included that language, it 

21

 would "lock into place" the majority black districts in 

22

 the South.  If you cannot diminish the ability to elect, 

23

 that means if there's a safe majority black district 

24

 where there's a 100 percent chance that black voters can 

25

 elect their candidates of choice, you cannot drop that 

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 to where they simply have a 50 percent chance, or a 60

2

 percent chance.  And that was what we were setting out 

3

 to do.  And this Court said that States get leeway in 

4

 complying with Section 5 and the Equal Protection Clause, 

5

 that we do not have to hit things right on the dot. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Brasher, I guess I don't 

7

 understand your response to Justice Ginsburg.  I mean, 

8

 there are different interpretations of what those 2006 

9

 amendments mean, right?  Under one interpretation, it 

10

 was basically a codification of Justice Souter's 

11

 opinion, and so majority minority districts could be 

12

 transformed into influence districts. 

13

 On another stricter interpretation, perhaps, 

14

 no majority minority districts had to stay majority 

15

 minority districts.  But in no interpretation does a 76 

16

 percent district have to stay a 76 percent district when 

17

 circumstances change and when the ability to elect 

18

 candidates of one's choice does not require it. 

19

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, this is what Justice 

20

 Souter said in his dissent in Georgia v. Ashcroft.  He 

21

 said, "If racial elements consistently vote in separate 

22

 blocks," which it's conceded that they do in Alabama, 

23

 "decreasing the proportion of black voters will 

24

 generally reduce the chance that the minority group's 

25

 favored candidate would be elected." 

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The majority opinion in Georgia v. Ashcroft

2

 agreed with that as well.  And the district court in 

3

 Georgia v. Ashcroft, which I think that Congress was 

4

 trying to go back to, said, "If existing opportunities 

5

 of minority voters to exercise their franchise are 

6

 robust, a proposed plan that leaves those voters with 

7

 merely a reasonable or fair chance of electing a 

8

 candidate of choice may constitute retrogression." 

9

 And the testimony from the plaintiffs' own 

10

 expert here was that majority black districts in Alabama 

11

 that are only 55 percent black would only give those 

12

 voters a reasonable opportunity to elect. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Suppose we, I don't know, I 

14

 want to know what you think about the practicalities of 

15

 sending this back.  Assume  assume in the back of my 

16

 mind just relying on State policy is this.  A State 

17

 legislator gets up and says, in our State, there's a 

18

 history of discrimination against black people.  There 

19

 are very few black representatives in this body.  I 

20

 would like to find a way of drawing district lines so 

21

 that we have a few more.  Okay? 

22

 That's the normal way this case comes up. 

23

 This is an obverse and odd situation.  All right.  I 

24

 don't know that that statement should automatically 

25

 disqualify his plan.  Maybe we should look a little 

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 further into it and see what they actually did.
 Suppose I start there. 

And then I say, 

3

 okay, you go proceed district by district.  I suspect 

4

 they will be able to prove that at least in some 

5

 districts, at least in some, the statement of the 

6

 legislator here did prevail and did make a difference. 

7

 Now, if that's so, they don't have Section 5 

8

 to rely on as a defense.  So I don't know what the 

9

 defense is possibly going to be.  And since we can't 

10

 even think what the defense is, why don't they just redo 

11

 this plan over in the legislature and save everybody a 

12

 lot of time and trouble.  What's your response to that? 

13
14
15
16

 MR. BRASHER: 

There are a couple of 

 responses.  The first is, I think 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I thought it was a lot of 

 trouble to redo a plan.  Is it not a lot of trouble? 

17

 MR. BRASHER: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It is a lot of trouble. 
So my point of my question 

19

 is you want to go to that lot of trouble before a lot of 

20

 extra trouble in court proceedings, or do you want to go 

21

 to that trouble right off the bat and get it over with? 

22

 I expect you'd have an answer to that, and 

23

 I'm not taking a point of view.  I just want to know 

24

 what your response is. 

25

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, to respond to that 

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 pointed question, this plan was passed after 21 hearings

2

 held throughout the State of Alabama.  It was passed 

3

 after extensive legislative negotiations.  It was passed 

4

 in a special session of the Alabama legislature that was 

5

 called for purposes of enacting a redistricting plan. 

6

 So we do not want to go back through that process 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course you don't, but my 

8

 question is, is there going to be a defense left that 

9

 could stop you from having to go back? 

10

 MR. BRASHER: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

12

 MR. BRASHER: 

Yes. 
What? 
I think the United States 

13

 agrees with me that the question here is whether there 

14

 was a strong basis in evidence for us to believe at the 

15

 time that we passed this plan that we had to comply with 

16

 Section 5, and I think we have that defense, even if we 

17

 are litigating district by district.  But let me 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What does it mean to 

19

 comply with Section 5?  And that's where you can say it 

20

 strongly  it complies  everybody agrees that that 

21

 counts, compliance with Section 5, strong interest in 

22

 doing that.  But if you think Section 5 means you got to 

23

 preserve the same numbers and that's not what Section 5 

24

 means, then the whole premise on which the district 

25

 court based its decision was wrong. 

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, I don't think so,

2

 because I think the district court's decision was 

3

 premised on the fact that race was not the predominant 

4

 factor in this plan.  But to go to that question about 

5

 Section 5, we adopted a very reasonable Section 5 

6

 preclearance strategy here.  It was the exact same thing 

7

 that Georgia did in 2005 and that Congress said in the 

8

 House report when it reauthorized Section 5 in 2006 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If that turns out to be 

10

 wrong, I guess you're still not guilty of using race. 

11

 You're still trying to comply with Section 5 as opposed 

12

 to being racist; right? 

13

 MR. BRASHER: 

That's exactly right.  They 

14

 did make intentional discrimination claims in the 

15

 district court 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If the district court said 

17

 that race was not the purpose of this plan, what in the 

18

 district court's view was the purpose of the plan? 

19

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, I don't think there's a 

20

 need for a district court to identify any one specific 

21

 purpose. 

22
23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I'm asking in this case, 

 what did they say? 

24

 MR. BRASHER: 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes. 
Was it the presumption 

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that they wanted to assure preclearance under Section 5

2

 and for that reason used race?  So when you say the 

3

 district court said, well, race was not the purpose, it 

4

 was close to the purpose because they were trying to use 

5

 Section 5 and use race for that reason. 

6

 MR. BRASHER: 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

8
9

Well, it was certainly 
That's a very fine 

 distinction. 
 MR. BRASHER: 

It was certainly a purpose 

10

 that went into the majority black districts, but it was 

11

 not the predominant motive in the way these laws were 

12

 drafted. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 to comply with Section 5? 

15

 MR. BRASHER: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17

Don't you have to use race 

That's right. 
Is there any way to comply 

 with Section 5 without using race? 

18

 MR. BRASHER: 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

There is not. 
But you don't have to use 

20

 race in this way, Mr. Brasher.  Nobody would say that 

21

 Section 5 required you to maintain a 78 percent district 

22

 and a 78 percent district was no longer needed with 

23

 respect to a group's ability to elect a candidate of 

24

 choice. 

25

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, I respectfully disagree 

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 with that.  And once again, we followed the same

2

 preclearance strategy that Georgia followed in 2005. 

3

 And that Congress  remember, Congress made a record in 

4

 2006 to try to reauthorize Section 5 and part of that 

5

 record was them saying that Georgia's plan from 2005, 

6

 which kept all of their majority black districts exactly 

7

 the same was a good thing.  We did the same thing in 

8

 this redistricting cycle that other States did in this 

9

 redistricting cycle.  We actually did the same thing 

10

 that the plaintiffs did when they were in charge of the 

11

 legislature in 2001.  There's been some inconsistency on 

12

 that.  The only difference is they tried to hit targets 

13

 from the 1993 plan as they were in 1993, and we simply 

14

 tried to keep the districts the same from 2010 to 2012. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could I follow up on 

16

 Justice Breyer's exploration of what would happen if 

17

 this was done over?  I assume that Section 5 would not 

18

 be a consideration so long as a new coverage formula is 

19

 not adopted by Congress.  Is that correct? 

20

 MR. BRASHER: 

Correct.  If the legislature 

21

 were to pass new plans, I do not think that they would 

22

 have to comply. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And the legislature could do 

24

 whatever it wants if it's  if it relies purely on 

25

 partisanship rather than on race. 

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BRASHER: 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That is correct.
And to what degree would or 

3

 could  to what degree would the legislature be 

4

 justified in doing and to what degree would it be 

5

 required to take into account the degree, if any, to 

6

 which Section 2 imposes something like a retrogression 

7

 requirement? 

8

 MR. BRASHER: 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

10
11

Well, I think 
Do we know what that 

 might be? 
 MR. BRASHER: 

I really honestly do not know 

12

 how Section 2 would necessarily apply in this 

13

 circumstance because by complying with Section 5 here, 

14

 we  we necessarily complied with Section 2 because 

15

 it's a lesser standard. 

16

 But I do think that it's  the fact that we 

17

 could have done, if we  if the plans are vacated, they 

18

 are very likely to just be the same plans 

19

 reauthorized 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What would happen if you 

21

 if you're  if on a doover, the objective was to 

22

 produce maximum Republican representation in both houses 

23

 of the legislature.  And the way in  and in doing 

24

 that, there was a drastic reduction in the number of 

25

 AfricanAmerican senators and representatives.  Would 

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 that be a violation of Section 2?
 MR. BRASHER: 

Not necessarily.  There would, 

3

 obviously, be a lot more that would go into that 

4

 analysis whether that violated Section 2.  You'd have to 

5

 look at each individual district and see if they can 

6

 make a Section 2 claim.  I mean, one of the issues in 

7

 this case is that this plan actually gives proportional 

8

 representation to black voters in Alabama.  There are 

9

 about 25 percent black voting age population in Alabama, 

10

 and they have about 25 majority black districts in the 

11

 House and about 20  I'm sorry, about 25 percent 

12

 majority black districts in the House and about 25 

13

 percent majority black districts in the Senate.  And so 

14

 this is  this plan meets Section 2 in that regard in 

15

 the sense that it gives proportional representation. 

16

 But I do not know what would happen, quite 

17

 frankly, if this  if the Court were to vacate these 

18

 plans and the legislature were to just do a doover. 

19

 And I would  to go back to the 2 percent 

20

 deviation, these are very sophisticated parties on the 

21

 other side of this case with very sophisticated counsel. 

22

 The reason they've never proposed any way to do this 

23

 following our own raceneutral redistricting criteria is 

24

 because they know that the 2 percent deviation here 

25

 prevents them from gerrymandering districts to help 

61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 white Democrats get elected because it would be very

2

 simple.  The 2 percent deviation was adopted at the very 

3

 beginning of this redistricting process, so the 

4

 plaintiffs had a year, while they were on the committee, 

5

 the reapportionment committee, to come up with their own 

6

 2 percent plan.  And instead, they just proposed these 

7

 10 percent deviation plans in the legislature. 

8

 And then we had a year of litigation for 

9

 them to come up with own 2 percent plan, and they 

10

 they didn't do that.  And that's what the district court 

11

 was getting at when the district court said that  you 

12

 know, the district court said race did not predominate 

13

 because we followed raceneutral redistricting criteria, 

14

 and then the district court suggested, you know what, 

15

 you know what this case is really about, it's about the 

16

 2 percent population deviation.  Because 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Brasher, you're 

18

 suggesting that there's some necessity for a 2 percent 

19

 plan, but there is no necessity for a 2 percent plan. 

20

 States have routinely gone up to 10 percent without 

21

 getting into trouble under Reynolds.  So that can't 

22

 insulate your plan from this kind of challenge, can it? 

23

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well, I think it can, and for 

24

 this reason, is because we're in charge of adopting our 

25

 raceneutral redistricting criteria.  And under Easley, 

62

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 if the plaintiffs want to prove that race predominated

2

 in a plan, the first step of that, and certainly the 

3

 easiest way to do it, is to propose some other way of 

4

 meeting raceneutral redistricting criteria that 

5

 provides greater racial balance. 

6

 And they haven't proposed any way to do 

7

 that, and the plans that they did propose, even though 

8

 they are 10 percent plans, are very, very similar in 

9

 many of these majority black districts.  So not only 

10

 have they not proposed a 2 percent plan that's our 

11

 criteria, but they actually  the plans they did 

12

 propose are not  not that different. 

13

 I think at the very least, the fact that the 

14

 plaintiffs have never proposed any way to do this 

15

 redistricting that actually meets the State's 

16

 raceneutral redistricting criteria underscores that you 

17

 cannot find that the district courts factfinding here 

18

 was clearly erroneous, that race did not predominate, 

19

 and I think the Court should affirm on that basis. 

20

 Let me address the question of remand for a 

21

 second here.  The United States has said that the Court 

22

 should remand this case.  But the United States' 

23

 position on that is internally inconsistent because the 

24

 United States agrees that the population percentages 

25

 alone in the districts are not sufficient for the 

63

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Plaintiffs to have met their burden of proof to show

2

 that race predominated. 

3

 But that's the only evidence they introduced 

4

 about these districts, and that's why the district court 

5

 said, to the best that I can tell, these are statewide 

6

 challenges because the only evidence in the record, 

7

 whatever they may have said, the only evidence in the 

8

 record about these districts was just population 

9

 statistics. 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You'd look at the  you'd 

11

 look at the complaint, when I look at the complaint, I 

12

 suspect I'll find something about districts.  It's 

13

 certainly true that, sort of taking the US point of 

14

 view, the  it's quite clear the  to me anyway, that 

15

 the court decided on the basis of a statewide plan.  So 

16

 if it's wrong about that, then they ought to have a 

17

 chance to go back and make their claim district by 

18

 district and have a decision on that basis. 

19

 MR. BRASHER: 

Well  and once again, I 

20

 don't think  they may have brought claims with respect 

21

 to each individual district.  I don't think they do.  I 

22

 think if you look at the complaint, you won't find that. 

23

 But even if they did, the only evidence that 

24

 they introduced about any of these districts are the 

25

 statistics alone, and the United States agrees with me 

64

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that that's insufficient for them to have met their

2

 burden of proof.  So I don't see how you could reverse 

3

 the district's factfinding as clearly erroneous that 

4

 race didn't predominant, given that all they introduced 

5

 was statistics. 

6

 I think The Court should affirm on the basis 

7

 of the factfinding and not reach questions about 

8

 Section 5.

 that ends my  thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD PILDES 
 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT 
 MR. PILDES: 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chief 

 Justice. 

18

 If I can, I'd like to address 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Is he right on that last 

20

 point?  Earlier, one of the two of you said that if you 

21

 looked at the division of precincts, it was done on the 

22

 basis of this policy in almost every district.  Was that 

23

 shown below? 

24
25

 MR. PILDES: 

We introduced all of that 

 precinct splitting information below and in our proposed 

65

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 findings of fact, Document Number 196, some of which is

2

 reproduced in one of the briefs.  We made exactly this 

3

 point, yes, Your Honor. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5

What other  besides 

 the statistics, what other evidence did you present? 

6

 MR. PILDES: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Your Honor, we 
I can go back to the 

8

 Joint Appendix, but I just want a summary of it from 

9

 you. 

10

 MR. PILDES: 

Your Honor, the key fact we 

11

 presented, I think, that hasn't been discussed here is 

12

 that the Alabama Constitution prohibits the splitting of 

13

 counties.  And they say they had a Supremacy Clause 

14

 obligation to meet these racial targets, and that meant 

15

 they could override the Alabama's  the Alabama 

16

 Constitution's protection of county boundaries and all 

17

 other State traditional districting principles. 

18

 And the 2 percent rule works the same way. 

19

 If that's actually a Federal constitutional requirement, 

20

 they can also override the key protections against 

21

 partisan gerrymandering.  The very that few exist, the 

22

 only hard constraints, the county boundaries are 

23

 political subdivision boundaries, and it means they can 

24

 manipulate the allimportant county delegations in the 

25

 Alabama legislature by breaking counties into multiple 

66

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 districts and then deciding who runs the county by

2

 putting their district in there. 

3

 Now, a second question we answered that I 

4

 think has been very important in this discussion  and, 

5

 by the way, I don't want to lose track of the fact that 

6

 on remand, the Alabama legislature will have to comply 

7

 with the whole county provisions, or at least they can't 

8

 use this Federal excuse to split them. 

9

 The way most States do this is they either 

10

 start with traditional districting principles in the 

11

 core of existing districts and they look to see at the 

12

 end have we maintained the same number of 

13

 majorityminority districts, or if they start with a 

14

 number at the beginning, which they're not required to, 

15

 they ask what's necessary in current conditions to 

16

 preserve the ability to elect today. 

17

 That's what Alabama did in its 2001 

18

 submissions.  It actually said that the number for the 

19

 ability to elect was a 55 percent black voting age 

20

 population.  That's in its official submissions to the 

21

 United States. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
