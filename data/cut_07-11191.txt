ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. FRIEDMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

We ask the Court in this case to take no new

11

ground beyond that established just last term in the

12

Melendez-Diaz case, but the stakes of this case are

13

high.

14

hold that a State may impose on the defendant the

15

burden of calling a prosecution witness to the stand,

16

it would severely impair the confrontation right and

17

threaten a fundamental transformation in the way

18

Anglo-American trials have been conducted for hundreds

19

of years.

20

If the Court were to reverse Melendez-Diaz and

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The State court has

21

interpreted their provision to give the defendant the

22

choice of subpoenaing the witness or asking the State

23

to bring in the witness.

24

Melendez-Diaz?

25

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Why is that overruling

Your Honor, the -- the State
3

courts, since the time of this case -- since the time

2

that these cases were tried, raised the possibility of

3

asking the -- that the defendant could ask the witness

4

to bring -- that the defendant could ask the

5

prosecution to bring in the witness.

6

really change anything from a straight subpoena

7

statute in any -- in either event.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. FRIEDMAN:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

Well, how is that

different from a notice statute?

10

It doesn't

If --

Okay.
If we take the statute

as the State supreme court has read it --

13

MR. FRIEDMAN:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
-- they say:

In my

15

mind, it's a notice statute; tell the prosecutor you

16

either want them to call the witness or you subpoena

17

the witness.

18

Whether or not you had notice of that interpretation

19

is a separate question.

20

MR. FRIEDMAN:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

That's what the State court has told us.

That -Let's separate out the

two questions.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Okay, fine, fine.

24

sorry, nothing in the Magruder case -- the opinion

5

burden of calling the witness to the stand.

14

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No.

16

prosecution would be compelled at least to ask:

Do you endorse this statement?

your answer to these questions is.

admit -- have the analyst provide a foundation for the

22

admission of the report, let's say, pursuant to the

23

hearsay exception for recorded recollection, and does

24

nothing more, would there be a Confrontation Clause

25

problem?

It's not clear to me what

If all the

1

MR. FRIEDMAN:

And there’s -- there’s the

2

question, “Is this your report?

3

Then -- then I don't think there is a Confrontation

4

Clause problem, because -- because the prosecution has

5

put the witness on the stand, has asked those

6

questions, and then the witness -- and --

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you stand by it?”

What's the difference

8

between that situation and the situation in which the

9

report is -- is admitted, subject to -- and the

10

analyst is available, and the defense can question the

11

analyst if the defense wishes to?

12

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, I think -- I think the

13

difference is that once you ask the question -- “Do

14

you stand by it?” -- then the witness has testified

15

one way or another.

16

17

accordance with the prior statement.

18

And the prosecution, as I say,

California v. Green at its word.

California v. Green

25

says and Owen follows up and says that if the witness

does not testify in accordance with the prior

2

statement, then the defendant has had some of the --

3

has had considerable benefit of cross-examination

4

already.

5

put the witness through that pace to make sure that

6

that happens.

9

So -- so the prosecution has to -- has to

Beyond that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:
just said.

I don't understand what you

Want to say it again?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

California v. Green

10

says that if the witness testifies inconsistently with

11

the prior statement, that the defendant has had the

12

benefit of cross-examination in showing the

13

inconsistency.

14

the difference, and I'm saying a difference, one

15

difference is, that if the witness does not testify in

16

accordance with the prior statement, that's apparent

17

to -- that's apparent to the jury.

18

the practical differences that we emphasize.

19

So -- so Justice Alito asked me what’s

There are also all

You are asking us now to

state something that you admit is in really no

21

constitutional case or historical case, that says the

22

right to confrontation means that the witness has to

23

tell the story, and the form of telling that story has

24

to be a verbal recitation; it can't be past recorded

25

recollection because you just said they have to tell

the story.

It can't be based on official documents or

saying that the -- that the witness has to take the

6

stand, has to -- has to testify live, viva voce, face

7

to face, in the time-honored phrases which have always

8

governed testimony in an Anglo-American trial.

9

10

what happened.

11

then the prior statement may be introduced.

6

Well, if -Bring in the witnesses.

8

Now, once you bring them in, the defendant can do what

9

he wants.

He has had his chance to cross-examine

10

them.

End of the matter, and leave the rest up to the

11

hearsay law.

12

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I want to emphasize that the

13

Confrontation Clause is about a lot more -- there were

14

nearly 200 years of history between Walter Raleigh and

15

the Confrontation Clause, and what was established is

16

that in an Anglo-American trial witnesses give their

17

testimony live, face to face, and Melendez-Diaz

18

emphasized last term you can't prove the case via an

19

affidavit.

20

So -- so it's -- it's the fundamental

21

question that -- that Crawford establishes --

22

fundamental principle that Crawford establishes is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why -- and -- I trust

2

the trial process, and much of your brief was talking

3

about that process --

4

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and the fact that

6

it's much more effective when the witness tells their

7

story and you get a chance to cross-examine than if

8

you have to start from the platform of

9

cross-examination.

Once a defendant makes it known

10

that a -- he's going to cross-examine a lab

11

technician, don't you think that in the vast majority

12

of cases the prosecutor is going to put that witness

13

on?

14

MR. FRIEDMAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -And if he does or

16

doesn't, why shouldn't we leave it to the normal trial

17

strategy and practice to leave to that prosecutor the

18

burden of non-persuasion, which is what confrontation

19

was about?

20

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

Which is --

If -- if the prosecutor is

23

certain that the defendant is going to put the witness

24

on the stand, then -- then the prosecutor has some

25

reason to -- to put the witness on first.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

The problem

Official

is that the -- the defunct Virginia statute puts the

2

burden on the defendant of bringing the witness in,

and the defense --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -- well, I was

starting from a different proposition than you did --

6

11

asked the State to bring that witness in?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16
17

How could you

But --- assume we are reading

it the way the Court has now.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Right.

The -- the fact is

18

that under the Virginia statute, given -- and as

19

interpreted by the Commonwealth, too -- given that the

20

defendant has the burden of putting the witness on the

21

stand, defendants rarely exercise that right, because

22

it's a corrupted right, because it isn't nearly as

23

valuable, as I think Your Honor understands, as the

24

right to stand up and cross-examine a witness who has

25

actually just testified.

5

cross-examination.

7

way the statute is -- is worded.

8
9

It's not in form

It's a right to make the witness

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Friedman, one of the

problems that has been brought up is that this is an

10

inordinate expense, and you're wasting the time of the

11

analyst.

12

that the analyst could testify from the lab, have

13

video conferencing, and so the analyst, while the

14

prosecutor must call her, can testify from the lab

15

instead of coming down to the courthouse?

16

Do you recognize any economy -- for example,

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That -- that is a --

17

certainly a possibility, at least on consent of the

18

defendant, and some States, including my own State of

19

Michigan, has been experimenting with that.

20

think that's a plausible possibility.

And I

21

Now, if the defendant were to insist on --

22

on live testimony, that is an open -- that's an open

23

question as to whether video testimony would be

24

acceptable.

25

transmit to Congress a proposed amendment to Federal

This Court some years ago refused to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the majority in a

2

statement by Justice Scalia said there is a virtual

3

satisfaction of the confrontation right, not a real

4

satisfaction.

5

So the matter as to whether it could be done

6

without consent hasn't been satisfied -- hasn't been

7

determined.

many cases I believe the defendants -- that those

JUSTICE ALITO:

How can you say that?

16

have an amicus brief from 26 States plus the District

17

of Columbia arguing exactly the contrary.

18

MR. FRIEDMAN:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, I

--

They say that there is a

20

very substantial category of cases in which defendants

21

really have no interest whatsoever in contesting

22

either the nature or the quantity of drugs involved,

23

but they will refuse to stipulate to those things

24

simply for the purpose of putting a financial burden

25

on the prosecution, because they know, if they do
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that, it may be helpful for them in getting a better

2

plea bargain, plus there is a certain risk that the

3

analyst will not show up, and they will get the

4

benefit of that.

5

MR. FRIEDMAN:

So, Your Honor, I think that

6

what the -- the States' amicus brief shows is that

7

there are -- there are a lot of drug prosecutions, and

8

there are a lot of drug analyses, and then there is

9

this speculation about the type of gamesmanship that

you have mentioned.

there is nothing supporting that.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The -- the

prosecution has to present the testimony of witnesses.

how the lab is organized -- usually, labs can organize

so that only one person needs to -- needs to present.

In any event, of course, the State is

Your answer to my question

24

is, if a laboratory is so organized so that six or

seven people perform different steps of the operation,
24

if it is organized in that way, all of them must be

you gave me an answer saying they did have to, so --

because you said they could organize differently.

now explain to me why they don't.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

7

Can the conclusion be presented by one

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think -- I think that there

8

probably has to be a witness who has observed the

9

procedures.

If I am -- and that's an issue that will

10

be presented to the Court, we can be pretty certain.

11

I think that issue is entirely orthogonal to the issue

here because the Commonwealth is acknowledging --

That’s a bit of -- a bit of

But the Commonwealth is acknowledging that

they have to bring in witnesses if the -- if the

much they -- they testify, and I want to --

The issue here is

5

is because floating in the back of my mind is -- is if

6

-- (a) does the Confrontation Clause apply?

7

MR. FRIEDMAN:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Right.
And if the answer to (a) is

yes, then are there different kinds of implementation

10

rules in different areas where there are other signs

11

of security, where there are other reasons for

12

thinking it's not bad testimony?

13

something that’s necessarily workable, and -- but I

14

brought it up to try to think about it.

15

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes.

That line is not

I think -- I think it's

16

an interesting question, and it’s question 3 in the

17

evidence exam that I am just grading, in fact.

18

think that’s an issue that the Court will have to

19

resolve.

20

But I

And, as I say, my views are what they --

21

what they are, but if you reject my views on that, it

22

doesn't change this case whatsoever.

23

What I think is important to recognize is

24

how fundamental a transformation in the Anglo-American

25

trial is threatened if -- if the Court were to hold

that the prosecution can present an affidavit and

cross-examine the analyst.

20

Anglo-American trials are conducted?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Now, how is

It's fundamental

23

transformation because the prosecution can present a

stack of affidavits, and they wouldn't even have to be

No.

6

beyond the facts of this case, where all -- all that

7

we are dealing with is a -- an analyst's report

relating to the -- the nature of the substance that

was tested and, if it's a controlled substance, the

slight difference between those two situations.

It doesn't extend to anything

MR. FRIEDMAN:

There’s such a

I think there’s an enormous

14

difference in -- in impact.

15

as I've emphasized in my brief, because of the

16

impairment of the ability to examine.

17

It's an enormous impact,

I don't believe it's cross-examination.

In

18

practice, it is -- if the defendant said, I don't want

19

to cross-examine, but I still insist that the witness

20

get up on the stand and let's see what the witness can

21

do -- and the Commonwealth makes no attempt to

22

distinguish between these witnesses and other

witnesses for what is -- what is satisfactory

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McCULLOUGH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

I think an appropriate place to start would

12

be how the Supreme Court of Virginia construed the

13

statute and get past that and into the confrontation

14

issue.

15

The first thing I would note there is that

16

the Petitioners simply have not challenged the

17

decision of the -- the interpretation of the Supreme

18

Court of Virginia that it placed on the statute.

19

think, to the extent that they are now, for the first

20

time in their reply brief, trying to raise a separate

21

due process issue, that the construction of the court

22

was so unreasonable that it violates due process, it's

23

far too late in the day to do that.

MR. McCULLOUGH:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How did they know at

trial that they were supposed to say to you:

5

want a subpoena; you bring them in.

6

MR. McCULLOUGH:

I don't

I think the -- the way the

7

Supreme Court of Virginia construed the statute is

8

perfectly sensible.

9

phrase is on page 2 of our brief -- that "no" --

What it says -- and the key

10

excuse me -- "such witnesses shall be summoned and

11

appear at the cost of the Commonwealth."

12

some statutes that say the defendant shall subpoena or

13

shall summon -- for example, like the Idaho and the

14

North Dakota statutes that the Petitioners cite --

And so did the court on

appeal.
How did they know that this was a notice­
and-demand statute as opposed to a subpoena statute?
MR. McCULLOUGH:

I think it was incumbent on

18

counsel to raise the issue exactly like counsel for

19

the defendant did in the Grant case.

20

noteworthy that in the Grant case the -- the motion

21

was filed well in advance of trial, on November 2nd,

22

2007, before the Supreme Court of Virginia ever

23

construed the statute in this fashion.

24

fact that a statute may be susceptible to more than

25

one interpretation doesn't obviate the need for

And so the

Official

counsel to take the steps that are necessary to

2

protect the right.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I ask you:

If we

4

were to -- how do we articulate a rule, or do we need

5

to, that would take care of the fears of your

6

adversary that trials would become trials by

7

affidavit, that the -- that prosecutors will choose to

8

put all witnesses on -- by videotape, by affidavit, by

9

deposition, whatever mode they choose except bringing

10

them into court -- and forcing defendants then to call

11

the witnesses and do a what's -- what I call a

12

cold-cross?

13

What rule would we announce in this case --

14

MR. McCULLOUGH:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think --- that would avoid --

16

what constitutional construction of the Confrontation

17

Clause would we issue that would protect against that?

18

MR. McCULLOUGH:

I think there are several

19

constitutional, legal, and practical considerations

20

that make this -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22
23

practical.

No, no.

Forget the

Talk about the legal, constitutional.
MR. McCULLOUGH:

Right.

Constitutionally,

24

there are two obstacles to a wholesale type of trial

25

system where the prosecution would simply present a
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

stack of affidavits.

2

The first of those is the Due Process

3

Clause, which -- for example, in these child witness

4

cases, what a number of courts have held is that it's

5

going to inflame the jury against the defendant if a

6

videotape is introduced and then the defendant is

7

called -- forced to call the witness to the stand.

8

And that's simply not the case with these types of

9

witness.

10
11
12
13

So the Due Process Clause itself puts the

brakes on the type of wholesale at-trial -JUSTICE SCALIA:

They're trial witnesses.

Anything else?
MR. McCULLOUGH:

Another is the fact that

14

under the Confrontation Clause, the cross-examination

15

has to be effective.

16

day of trial dumps a series of affidavits on the

17

defense, it's going to be pretty difficult for the

18

defense to be in a position to effectively

19

cross-examine.

20

And so if the prosecution on the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, just one or two.

Just

21

one or two affidavits.

Or it -- the court has a rule

22

you have to provide those affidavits several weeks

23

before trial.

That would be okay?

24

MR. McCULLOUGH:

I think, under the --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We'd have a whole

MR. McCULLOUGH:

It would be trial by

Right.

I don't think the

4

Confrontation Clause, in terms of what it's

5

historically intended to protect, blocks that

6

scenario.

7

I think the key to the Confrontation Clause,

8

what this Court has said for a long time, turning to

9

the history of the clause, is that it's designed to

10

protect the reliability of the government's evidence.

11

And the way it does that is by subjecting that to the

12

crucible of cross-examination, face to face, of live

13

witnesses.

14

that is, the defendant says he wants the witness there

MR. McCULLOUGH:

I think your question goes

to the very heart of why we have the Confrontation

we are so accustomed to this clean order of

The Confrontation Clause is because, for

what you are doing when you have this witness on the

Well, to put my chips on

17

the table, which you probably understand, I thought

18

the reliability of this evidence in the mine run of

cases was such, and the distance from Sir Walter

Raleigh was sufficiently great, that it fell outside

the scope of the Confrontation Clause for those two

reasons, but mine was a dissenting opinion.

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Well, I think, though, even

-- that's why -- they were enraged because of this

deeply unfair trial procedure.

different about Virginia criminals.

these kinds of gamesmanship demands.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

13

MR. McCULLOUGH:

Well, a cross-examination­

14

focused statute like this one more blatantly exposes

15

that type of gamesmanship and, therefore, may have a

16

better deterrent value, as opposed to a garden variety

18

I do want to just say, really briefly, that

19

the practical concerns, even if they are not

constitutional concerns, are very important because

21

the prosecution always bears the burden of persuasion,

MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's not what we said in

Melendez-Diaz, unfortunately.

18

MS. KRUGER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, Melendez-Diaz -We said the following:

20

“More fundamentally, the Confrontation Clause imposes

21

a burden on the prosecution to present its witnesses,

22

not on the defendant to bring those adverse witnesses

23

defendant to subpoena the affiants, if he chooses.”
So you are asking us to overrule that -that statement?
MS. KRUGER:

No, Justice Scalia, not at all.

5

We believe that a State complies with that very rule

6

from Melendez-Diaz when it ensures that the analyst is

7

present in court to submit to cross-examination, which

8

is the core of the confrontation right.

9

affirmed in its decision --

MS. KRUGER:

That's right, and that's --

this addressed.

16

system in which the prosecution presents its evidence

17

18

affiants if he chooses.

19

It's not -- it's not replaced by a

MS. KRUGER:

This Court has recognized that

20

the confrontation right is designed to achieve a

21

particular purpose, and that is to ensure that the

22

government's evidence is subject to adversarial

23

testing at trial.

24
25

It is ultimately up to the defendant in
every case to decide, no matter how the prosecution
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

presents its evidence on direct, whether or not it

2

wants to confront the witness and submit that

3

witness's testimony to adversarial testing --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That may be.

It's a

5

perfectly reasonable argument.

6

saying that it doesn't contradict Melendez-Diaz.

7

MS. KRUGER:

I just object to your

I think it would be surprising

8

to discover that Melendez-Diaz went quite so far.

9

This Court has never before recognized a dimension of

10

the Confrontation Clause that would govern the manner

11

in which the prosecution presents its evidence, except

12

for the rule that it affirmed it in Crawford, which is

13

that so long as the government ensures that the

14

witness is available for cross-examination at trial,

15

the Confrontation Clause places no constraints on the

16

government's use of prior testimony or statements.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So the

18

statement, the sentence in this opinion, that, in your

19

opinion, would have the effect of limiting

20

Melendez-Diaz without overruling it, what is that

21

statement?

22

MS. KRUGER:

I think the statement is it

23

requires only that the Court reaffirm what it already

24

said in Crawford, in the context of the lab analyst

25

testimony at issue in this case, which is, again, when
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the analyst is available for cross-examination at

2

trial, the government has complied with what the

3

Confrontation Clause demands.

4

It has provided a constitutionally

5

sufficient opportunity for the defendants to submit

6

that analyst's findings to adversarial testing --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it just doesn't --

8

doesn't apply just to analysts, right?

9

there anything peculiar about analysts?

10
11

I mean, is
Would it not

exist for any other witness?
MS. KRUGER:

Well, our principal submission

12

is that the Confrontation Clause provides, in every

13

case, an opportunity for effective cross-examination.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MS. KRUGER:

Okay.

And there may be independent

16

constraints on the manner in which the prosecution

17

presents its evidence under the laws of evidence in

18

the jurisdiction because of the government's need to

19

satisfy its burden of proof and ensure a fundamentally

20

fair trial under the Due Process Clause.

21

To the extent that the Court --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23
24
25

I don't understand what --

is that a yes or a no?
MS. KRUGER:

Well, it is to say that

Confrontation Clause is not what prohibits that
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

practice.

2

equally effective sources in the law --

3

What prohibits that practice are other

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So as far as the

4

Confrontation Clause is concerned, this would apply to

5

other witnesses as well?

6

MS. KRUGER:

I think that that’s right, but

7

even if the Court were to disagree with that

8

submission, this Court could rely on the kinds of

9

distinctions that it has drawn in other cases, like

10

Inadi or like White v. Illinois, which recognized that

11

there is a class of hearsay evidence that’s not simply

12

a weaker substitute for live testimony at trial, that

13

has independent, probative significance that makes it

14

somewhat irrelevant whether or not the court --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Indicia of reliability --

16

you want us to go back to that?

17

(Laughter.)

18

MS. KRUGER:

Is that --

No, it's not a question of the

19

reliability.

20

in which hearsay evidence and its admissibility was

21

dependent on reliability with one in which the

22

touchstone is an opportunity for cross-examination.

23

What Crawford did was replace a system

And it's precisely in response to that point

24

that Crawford, again, reaffirmed the rule that it

25

first announced in Green, that so long as the
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

out-of-court declarant is present at trial to explain

2

or defend his out-of-court statements, the

3

Confrontation Clause is satisfied.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

What if it doesn't quite

5

work, that the Confrontation Clause seems to be

6

expanding, just with the opportunity for

7

cross-examination creating all kinds of incursions

8

into areas where it’s not necessary for fairness

9

purposes?

10

Then does it make sense to say -- hey,

11

unfortunately, to say that the only workable system is

12

that you have a system which has exactly the

13

confrontation point, but indicia of reliability do

14

have an impact as to what the implications of the

15

Confrontation Clause violation are, in terms of

16

practical trial necessity.

17

MS. KRUGER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

But -Now, there we are,

accepting the warnings of the dissenters in Crawford.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MS. KRUGER:

I don't think that the

22

touchstone of this Court's analysis need return to the

23

now discredited Ohio v. Roberts regime.

24
25

It's simply a practical point.

To the

extent the Petitioners are arguing that their
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

opportunity to confront and to cross-examine is

2

constitutionally inadequate merely because the

3

prosecution hasn't guaranteed that it would call the

4

witness to the stand first, I think the court can take

5

due account of the fact that that is not necessarily

6

so.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what about Raleigh's

8

witnesses -- you know, the hypothetical I gave you,

9

for the heart of the matter, the heart of the matter,

10

and they stick it in their affidavits, and you say,

11

oh, don't worry, don't worry, you can cross-examine

12

them later in the trial.

13

MS. KRUGER:

I think, to the extent that the

14

Court were otherwise inclined to invent a new body of

15

Confrontation Clause jurisprudence to govern the

16

manner in which the prosecution puts on its witnesses

17

and questions them, this isn't the appropriate case to

18

do it because, as we have seen from Petitioners’

19

20

substantive difference from a defendant's

21

perspective -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

rely on affidavits, so long as it bring the affiants

Well, it's -- it’s somewhat of

24

question that arises particularly frequently.

But even if you disagreed with that, we

MS. KRUGER:

I think that this -- this case

8

Court to provide guidance to States that are currently

9

grappling with how to respond to the practical

10

problems that have been presented in the wake of

11

Melendez-Diaz.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So do we say to them,

contrary to what Melendez-Diaz is, that subpoena

defendant has to subpoena the witness.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the -- just

the first one, the no-notice problem, that's kind of

silly, isn't it?

Because if you are being prosecuted

2

government is going to try to prove that.

3

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's likely, of course.

4

But the fact is Virginia knows how to write a good

5

notice-and-demand statute and has done it, and

6

contrast the -- the new statute, which gives 28 days

notice.

wanted to write a notice-and-demand statute before, it

It's -- it's very glaring.

If Virginia

12

after the defendants' -- after the defendants' trials

13

-- let me say, after the defendants' trials, the --

14

the prosecution is saying, you could have subpoenaed.

15

And they said this isn't testimony.

16

wrong on both of those counts.

17

And what happened is after the --

Okay?

They were

After the defendants' trials, in a case

18

called Brooks, the -- the Virginia Court of Appeals

19

suggested that the defendant could ask the prosecution

20

to bring the witness in.

21

including Grant, the defendant on whom -- in the case

22

on whom the Commonwealth relies so heavily.

23

Many defendants did that,

The prosecution ignored those requests.

It

24

was still taking the view that this is not -- this is

25

not testimonial.

Up until the moment that this Court

decided Melendez-Diaz, the Commonwealth in Virginia

2

in -- in Grant said, we don't have to bring the

3

witness in; the witness -- the defendant should

4

subpoena the witness if he wants.

5

No court has ever held -- no court has ever

6

held in Virginia that the prosecution bears the risk

7

of -- of no-shows.

9

Now, the Commonwealth and the United States
suggest:

Oh, it's okay to -- to transform the way

10

trials are conducted by allowing the prosecution to

11

present affidavits because you can backfill with the

12

Due Process Clause.

13

decisions of this Court that say when there’s a

14

specific right addressed to a particular situation, we

15

rely on that, not on the Due Process Clause.

16

I think that goes against

JUSTICE ALITO:

the more fundamental problem, which is that the

20

statute.

response here is the Court has taken the case; there

is enough without any -- resolving any ambiguities of

14

the Virginia statute to say that the -- this procedure

15

is unconstitutional, because it imposes -- even

upon the defendant the burden of putting the witness

18

on the stand.

acceptable, I think it’s proper for the Court to say

right now that it -- that it is not.
