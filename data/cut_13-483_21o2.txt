 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (11:08 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

next in Case 13483, Lane v. Franks. 

5

 Mr. Singh? 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TEJINDER SINGH 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8
9
10

 MR. SINGH: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Petitioner, Mr. Edward Lane, alleges that 

11

Respondent, Steve Franks, fired him in retaliation for 

12

his testimony before a Federal grand jury in district 

13

court on a matter that is undisputedly a public concern, 

14

the misconduct of a State legislator. 

15

 Petitioner testified about events that he 

16

learned while working, but the testimony itself was not 

17

a part of his job responsibilities. 

18

 This Court should hold that Petitioner's 

19

testimony implicates the First Amendment because he 

20

spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.  It 

21

should further hold that this was clearly established in 

22

2009 when Respondent Franks fired him. 

23

 Those fold  holdings follow from a long 

24

line of this Court's precedents, which establishes that 

25

the First Amendment applies to all public employee

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

speech on matters of public concern, except when the 

2

employee speaks pursuant to his official duties. 

3

 The remainder of the case, including the 

4

application of the Pickering balancing test and 

5

Respondent's other defenses can all be addressed on 

6

remand. 

7

 This Court can also leave for another day 

8

the question of whether a public employee who testifies 

9

in court but pursuant to his official responsibilities 

10
11

would be protected. 
 The way the case has shaken out in the 

12

briefing, the principal point of contention has become 

13

whether the fact that Petitioner learned the facts about 

14

which he testified at work is sufficient to deprive his 

15

testimony of protection. 

16

 But for decades 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if it  what if the 

18

person who testified had the definite job responsibility 

19

of investigating possible corruption in the agency? 

20

Suppose that that person was something like an Inspector 

21

General. 

22

 MR. SINGH: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

24
25

If 
When would the testimony 

be  be within the scope of the person's job duties? 
 MR. SINGH: 

I think it would depend on the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

circumstances of the particular case. 
 And that would be the exact next question, 

3

because the responsibility to investigate by itself does 

4

not necessarily also include the responsibility to 

5

testify.  And so in certain cases you could imagine 

6

where there is an internal investigator whose job is to 

7

deal with issues internally and that wouldn't be covered 

8

by job responsibilities.  But there may be other cases 

9

in which that investigator also regularly testifies. 

10

 In this case, there is no dispute that my 

11

client's responsibility was to manage the staff of his 

12

department and therefore to deal with issues that arose. 

13

But there is also no dispute that he was never expected 

14

to testify in court and that this testimony was all the 

15

result of a subpoena issued by a Federal court in 

16

response to a request from Federal prosecutors.  And so 

17

I think that that is the  that case gets us towards 

18

the harder question that this Court doesn't have to 

19

decide in this case. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, just to follow up on 

21

that, could there be ever a situation in which a 

22

government employee's testimony is within the scope of 

23

that employee's duties if the employee is not  does 

24

not testify on behalf of his employer? 

25

 MR. SINGH: 

I think that there is 

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If the employee is 

2

subpoenaed by  by the opposite side, then you would 

3

say that's enough, that makes the testimony outside the 

4

scope of the employee's responsibilities? 

5

 MR. SINGH: 

I think that would be strong 

6

evidence.  In Garcetti v. Ceballos this Court 

7

articulated the scope of an employee's duties and the 

8

determination of whether an employee is acting in the 

9

scope of those duties is a practical inquiry, and so it 

10

would vary considerably case to case.  I think the fact 

11

of a subpoena is strong evidence that when an employee 

12

testifies he is not doing so because it's his job to do 

13

so.  There is a separate and very strong obligation. 

14

But again, that's really just one 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So I think you're 

16

let's use the quintessential example, police officers or 

17

lab technicians.  Generally they are called by the 

18

prosecutor, but occasionally they are called by defense 

19

attorneys.  So when are they immunized and when are they 

20

not?  When are they acting within the scope of their 

21

duties and when are they not? 

22

 MR. SINGH: 

Your Honor, in those cases I 

23

think there would be an argument that in every case they 

24

are acting in the scope of their duties if you consider 

25

the practical circumstances that give rise to that

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

testimony.  But there is also an argument, and this is 

2

sort of the strong version of the First Amendment, the 

3

argument that we make  this is not the rule that we 

4

are asking for, but this is the rule that's asked for by 

5

the ACLU, by a couple of the other amici. 

6

 The strong version of the First Amendment 

7

argument is that even in those circumstances there is a 

8

separate and a superior obligation to testify truthfully 

9

to the court, that is, to provide information in a way 

10

that is unbiased toward the interests of the employer. 

11

And recognizing First Amendment protection furthers that 

12

interest because it frees the employee to testify 

13

candidly and completely.  And, Your Honor mentioned the 

14

word "immunity" 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what happens in a 

16

situation where a police officer gets on the stand and 

17

in testifying honestly admits to corruption, admits to 

18

 or does it in a slovenly way, comes to court dressed 

19

in a clown suit?  Could the employer fire him then? 

20

 MR. SINGH: 

I think the answer is almost 

21

certainly yes, and that occurs through the application 

22

of the Pickering balancing test.  The way that First 

23

Amendment protection for employee speech has worked 

24

since the 1960s is that when speech relates to a matter 

25

of public concern, the speech  the First Amendment

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

applies. 
 The next question, which is whether the 

3

employer discipline is nevertheless permitted, is a 

4

function of a balancing of the employee's interest in 

5

speaking and society's interest in hearing the speech 

6

versus the employer's interest in effectively and 

7

efficiently providing public services. 

8

 In the case of the clown suit, in the case 

9

of testimony that's unprepared, reflects badly on the 

10

department, all of those are justifications that any 

11

employer can use to argue that, even though the First 

12

Amendment applies, discipline is nevertheless warranted. 

13
14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is there any  would 

there be any Pickering balancing in this case? 

15

 MR. SINGH: 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

If this Court 
If the Court says that 

17

speech is protected, would there be any need to go on 

18

these facts into a Pickering balance? 

19

 MR. SINGH: 

Your Honor, we don't believe 

20

that in the summary judgment record there is any 

21

evidence that my client's speech was at all disruptive, 

22

and that's why the United States has argued that if you 

23

perform the balancing test here yourself you can find in 

24

our favor.  Nevertheless, we think it's okay to remand 

25

that question.  We haven't briefed it.  We haven't asked

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

you to decide it. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But we are asked to 

3

decide the qualified immunity and how can we find there 

4

is no qualified immunity in view of the Morris v. Crow 

5

decision? 

6

 MR. SINGH: 

We think the Morris decision is 

7

plainly distinguishable.  There are a few arguments that 

8

we would raise against that decision.  The first is, and 

9

this is a point that's been made by not only us but also 

10

the United States and the Alabama attorney general, that 

11

Morris is flatly contrary to this Court's precedents. 

12

All of the emphasis in Morris on whether the employee 

13

was intending to speak out on a matter of public concern 

14

finds no support in the way this Court has applied the 

15

rules relating to public employee speech.  But 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That means the Eleventh 

17

Circuit is wrong.  Should the employee be victimized 

18

because they were following circuit bad precedent? 

19

Whether it's good or bad doesn't matter under our 

20

jurisprudence. 

21

 MR. SINGH: 

Your Honor, I would be willing 

22

to concede, if the case were clearly on point, that 

23

qualified immunity should perhaps nevertheless apply.  I 

24

think it's highly questionable, but it's an open 

25

question and I would be willing to concede that.

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The reason  the real reason that Morris is 

2

not a problem for us at all is that Morris is not close 

3

to the facts of this case.  In Morris, a sheriff's 

4

accident investigator prepared an internal report 

5

describing a car accident in which another sheriff 

6

caused a civilian death.  The report surmised that the 

7

accident was the sheriff's fault.  And then he was 

8

subpoenaed to testify in the civil wrongful death case. 

9

He was shortly fired thereafter. 

10

 He brought a claim seeking both 

11

protection of the report itself, which of course is on 

12

all fours with this Court's decision in Garcetti holding 

13

that an internal memorandum prepared in the course of 

14

official duties is not protected.  He also sought 

15

protection for his deposition testimony describing it. 

16

 We do think the Eleventh Circuit was wrong 

17

to hold that that testimony was unprotected, but it's of 

18

no moment, because private, closed door civil deposition 

19

testimonies describing bad driving are nothing like 

20

public trial testimony describing public corruption. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is there a different 

22

Eleventh  Is there a different Eleventh Circuit case 

23

he should have looked at?  I mean, you don't think this 

24

is close, but is there a closer precedent that he should 

25

have looked at?

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SINGH: 

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, there 

2

is.  In 1992 the Eleventh Circuit decided a case called 

3

Martinez v. City of OpaLocka. 

4
5
6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes, but it was 

expressly distinguished in Morris. 
 MR. SINGH: 

But it was distinguished only on 

7

grounds that would also distinguish this case.  The 

8

grounds on which the Eleventh Circuit distinguished 

9

Martinez in Morris were that the testimony was in a 

10

public proceeding and that it identified public 

11

corruption, which is exactly what happened here.  And so 

12

we think there is no sound basis upon which the Eleventh 

13

Circuit could say Morris doesn't apply  Martinez 

14

doesn't apply and Morris does. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, why should we get to 

16

that question?  It wasn't decided below.  It's their 

17

law.  Why shouldn't we kick it back to the Eleventh 

18

Circuit? 

19

 MR. SINGH: 

I'm sorry, I think the qualified 

20

immunity question was decided below.  The Eleventh 

21

Circuit both found that there was no constitutional 

22

right, but also I believe footnote 2 of the court's 

23

opinion says because we find that there is no right we 

24

would also find no qualified immunity. 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

My mistake.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SINGH: 

And so the issue is squarely 

2

before you.  And I think that it's  getting to that 

3

question does not require the Court to do very much 

4

work.  We're not asking for a new rule of law relating 

5

to qualified immunity.  We're not asking you to dilute 

6

the protection that officers currently have.  What we 

7

are asking for is a relatively straightforward 

8

application of this Court's precedents in, for example, 

9

Groh. 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We might have to send it 

11

back.  If we were to say, yes, they did violate the 

12

Constitution, next question would be is it clear?  I 

13

mean, the Second Circuit thought they didn't 

14

violate the Constitution.  Isn't that right? 

15

 MR. SINGH: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 
And so they say obviously 

17

they didn't violate the Constitution, they didn't 

18

clearly violate the Constitution.  So if we were to say, 

19

no, you did violate the Constitution, that footnote does 

20

not express any view. 

21

 MR. SINGH: 

22
23

That's  that's correct.  The 

Eleventh Circuit did not rule on whether 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So if they got the whole 

24

thing wrong from beginning to end, they might have to 

25

send it back, we send it back and say you got it wrong, it

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

did violate the Constitution; now tell us if it's clear. 
 So which should we do, decide it ourselves 

3

whether it was clear, it's a matter of Eleventh Circuit 

4

precedent or should we send it back to their tender 

5

mercy? 

6

 MR. SINGH: 

I think you should decide the 

7

question, Your Honor.  I think that the principal 

8

guidance that the lower courts require is clarity about 

9

what the constitutional standard is.  Once you write the 

10

opinion explaining that there was a violation of the 

11

Constitution in this case, I think that that opinion 

12

will establish that it's clear and it will establish 

13

that it was clear in 2009. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Those are two very 

15

different things.  You spend a fair amount of time in 

16

your brief talking about court of appeals decisions from 

17

other circuits.  But I think it's a little bit of a 

18

heroic leap to assume that employees are familiar with 

19

court of appeals decisions in their own circuit.  Do you 

20

really think we should be looking at the opinions from 

21

other circuits in deciding whether the law was clearly 

22

established in a different circuit? 

23

 MR. SINGH: 

In  in Ashcroft vs. alKidd, 

24

this Court articulated the standard for qualified 

25

immunity as either there's controlling precedent in the

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jurisdiction or there is a consensus of persuasive 

2

authorities.  And we've cited a couple of cases decided 

3

after Garcetti from other circuits holding that public 

4

employee speech was protected.  I don't want that to 

5

obscure the fact that before Garcetti, there were many, 

6

many, many more cases.  There was an overwhelming 

7

consensus in the circuits that this type of testimony 

8

was protected.  The Eleventh Circuit really is out on 

9

its own here.  And when you consider the strength of 

10
11

that consensus 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, if you say the 

12

Eleventh Circuit is out on its own, it seems to me to be 

13

a concession that their law is different from the law 

14

that you're arguing for.  And, again, my point is:  Do 

15

you ask a  a State employee to recognize, yes, this is 

16

the law in the Eleventh Circuit, but they're out on 

17

their own.  So we're going to follow a  a different 

18

law? 

19

 MR. SINGH: 

Your Honor, our argument is that 

20

the Eleventh Circuit was wrong, but until this case, 

21

they weren't wrong enough to justify this result.  In 

22

1992, the Martinez case set down clear markers that 

23

would allow and should have compelled a result in our 

24

favor.  In this case, Martinez was raised below and the 

25

Eleventh Circuit simply ignored it, choosing to rely

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instead on Morris.  We think that was a very grave 

2

mistake of interpreting not only this Court's law, but 

3

Eleventh Circuit law.  And we think that especially in 

4

light of this Court's precedents, that misinterpretation 

5

of Eleventh Circuit precedent was especially egregious. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I go back to my point, 

7

which is they got it wrong.  But do we expect the 

8

employee to know they got it wrong or under what 

9

circumstances do we expect them to know? 

10

 MR. SINGH: 

I think an instructive case is 

11

Groh v. Ramirez.  In that case, it was a Fourth 

12

Amendment case involving a warrant that didn't state 

13

particulars on its face.  The district court found that 

14

there was no Fourth Amendment violation at all.  The 

15

circuit court affirmed on grounds of qualified immunity, 

16

and this Court reversed on both grounds, said there was 

17

a violation and the violation was clear. 

18

 And one of the points that the Court made, 

19

and this is in Footnote 9 of the Court's opinion, was 

20

that that was not a case in which, for example, police 

21

officers make splitsecond judgments in the field.  That 

22

was a case where an officer had ample time to figure out 

23

what the law was.  Here we're dealing with a university 

24

administrator, who has a general counsel, who has the 

25

ability to consult that counsel before making any

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

personnel decisions.  And the qualified immunity 

2

standard has always asked, what would a reasonable 

3

official in the position of the relevant Defendant have 

4

done.  So there may be cases in which it would be very 

5

hard for an employee 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  Tell me what 

7

you want as your rule.  Anyone subpoenaed in a criminal 

8

trial is protected? 

9

 MR. SINGH: 

No, Your Honor.  We're not 

10

asking the Court to rule that broadly in this case.  All 

11

we want is a rule that says when a public employee 

12

testifies on a matter of public concern and does not do 

13

so pursuant to his job responsibilities, the First 

14

Amendment protects that testimony subject to the 

15

Pickering balance that it always has.  And that is, in 

16

fact, the rule that this Court laid down in Garcetti. 

17

To the extent that any clarification is required, the 

18

only clarification would be that even when the testimony 

19

describes facts that the employee learned in the course 

20

of employment, it's still protected.  But that's not a 

21

leap at all from this Court's precedents. 

22

 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

5

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING 
 AFFIRMANCE IN PART AND REVERSAL IN PART 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 
 In Garcetti, this Court recognized that the 

6

government, like any private employer, has a strong 

7

interest in managing and supervising its employees as 

8

they do their jobs.  That managerial interest extends 

9

even to the thousands of agents, investigators, 

10

technicians, and other employees who  across the 

11

government who are expected, as part of their job 

12

responsibilities, to testify in court. 

13

 In our view, when government employees 

14

testify, they sometimes speak as citizens and they 

15

sometimes speak as employees.  We agree that Petitioner 

16

here spoke as a citizen when he testified, but we 

17

disagree with the suggestion of some of the amici that 

18

government employees always speak as citizens rather 

19

than as 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes.  What's an example of 

21

a subpoena that requires the employee to testify, but 

22

that he's not testifying on public matters? 

23

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I think the 

24

example would be a police officer executing a warrant. 

25

We think the subpoena isn't really the right test.

There are times when 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

3

But my hypothetical is 

there is a subpoena, you are required to testify. 

4

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I think, Your Honor 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And then you've  you 

6

indicate that there are some matters on which the 

7

employee is not  not protected. 

8

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, we think 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What is an example of 

10
11

that? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

We think that, for 

12

example, a police officer whose job it is to investigate 

13

and testify about what he saw to support a warrant or 

14

something like that would be a situation which he could 

15

be subpoenaed by  by the defense to testify, for 

16

example, and it would still be part of his job 

17

responsibilities.  The fact of the subpoena doesn't 

18

change that a technician or an officer or an 

19

investigator may be called to testify as part of his 

20

duties.  I take 

21
22
23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you could fire 

him because he testified? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, there is a 

24

range of discipline  disciplinary activities that 

25

would be available to employees.  I think what Garcetti

19

Alderson Reporting Company

1

3

says 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I  I still can't get the 

hypothetical.  What  what am I 

4

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I  I just can't imagine 

6

a case that's not  not a matter of public interest. 

7

Now, I can assume that if  if the employee indicates 

8

that he was dishonest or if he indicates that he's 

9

clearly incompetent, some of the hypotheticals given in 

10

the early argument, I understand that.  But so far as 

11

the subject matter, it's the subject matter is of public 

12

concern.  Necessarily, if it's a subpoena, is it not, or 

13

am I wrong? 

14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

No.  Your Honor, we would 

15

say that in a criminal case  I want to distinguish 

16

between the public concern aspect of the test and then 

17

the citizen employee aspect.  Because they really are 

18

distinct.  In a criminal case if you are subpoenaed, we 

19

would say that you are testifying on a matter of public 

20

concern.  But that's not the same question as whether 

21

you're testifying as a citizen or as an employee, which 

22

is exactly what this Court addressed in Garcetti.  We do 

23

think that Petitioner, someone who was not regularly 

24

expected to testify in court as part of his government 

25

responsibilities, would be testifying as a citizen on a

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

matter of public concern. 

2

 However, there will be situations, and the 

3

government has thousands of people whose job it is to 

4

investigate, who are records custodians, sometimes even 

5

testify on a 30(b)(6) on behalf of the government, 

6

they're actually speaking for the government, who could 

7

be called by subpoena, who would then be testifying as 

8

employees even though their speech is on a matter of 

9

public. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But if the 

11

subpoena is not to the government and if the subpoena is 

12

just to the particular person?  What are the  what's 

13

the context in which that person should not receive a 

14

minimum of protection subject to Pickering balancing, 

15

but that that should be  why not consider that 

16

protected? 

17

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, because that's 

18

exactly what the Court held in Garcetti.  The government 

19

shouldn't be disabled from being able to judge and 

20

evaluate the  the performance of its employees.  For 

21

example, the employee may show a lack of judgment; the 

22

employee may be belligerent.  Juries may not be 

23

believing this 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that was Justice Kagan's 

qualification.  That's the Pickering balance.

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, but this is 

2

that is, I think what we would  that's what the  the 

3

ACLU amicus urges, and we strongly urge the Court not to 

4

do that.  That argument was available in Garcetti, as 

5

well.  It's always available to say, just take this at 

6

step two of the balance, but that would 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, wait a minute. 

8

What are you doing about the truthfinding functions of 

9

the  of a trial setting when you're saying or telling 

10

people, employees, don't go and tell the truth because 

11

if the truth hurts your employer, you're going to be 

12

fired? 

13

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Your Honor, there is a 
That there's 

15

something  you can be always fired for some other 

16

reason that the employer can point to under Pickering or 

17

otherwise, but what kind of message are we giving when 

18

we're telling employees, you're subpoenaed for any reason in 

19

a trial, go and tell a falsehood because otherwise you 

20

can be fired? 

21

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, if it's actual 

22

instruction to do a falsehood, there's a range of 

23

protections that the government  that  that are 

24

available.  There are whistleblower  there are 

25

whistleblower statutes, Federal prosecution 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You mean the 

2

Constitution doesn't protect someone in a trial from 

3

telling the truth?  That it's not a matter of public 

4

concern that an employee tell the truth? 

5

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, it is a matter 

6

of public concern.  But we think it's the same as in 

7

Garcetti.  What was at issue in Garcetti was a false 

8

affidavit to the Court to support a warrant.  And what 

9

this Court says  what it said was it was part of the 

10

employee's job to  to investigate.  And in that 

11

situation he was acting on behalf of the government. 

12

 Now, we would say that you don't have to 

13

reach this question, but we urge the Court not to hold 

14

what the ACLU  and I gather Petitioner is  is 

15

stepping back from here  a broad rule saying that any 

16

time an employee testifies in court, it is automatically 

17

speech as a citizen, as distinct from on a matter of 

18

public concern.  We think that that would really intrude 

19

on the government's ability to  to supervise its 

20

employees who are testifying.  As I say, there may be 

21

lack of candor, there may be belligerent  belligerency 

22

and things like that that the government has to be able 

23

to  to react to and rely on whistleblower statutes and 

24

criminal prosecutions and First Amendment protections in 

25

true whistleblowing context for  to provide protection

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

for the  for  for employees. 
 If I could just touch briefly on the 

3

qualified immunity.  We do not think that this case 

4

should be sent back.  We think  we agree with the 

5

Chief Justice and Justice Sotomayor that the Eleventh 

6

Circuit decision was sufficiently clear that an employee 

7

could not be said to have been either plainly 

8

incompetent or intentionally violating the law when it 

9

relied on that Eleventh Circuit precedent 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Gershengorn, could 

11

I ask the question that I tried and failed to ask 

12

Mr. Singh?  Because Justice Breyer is, of course, 

13

completely right.  This footnote 2 doesn't really answer 

14

the question.  It answers it on a hypothesis that the 

15

constitutional issue came out in a certain way, and then 

16

it said, a fortiori there is 

17

immunity.  So it didn't really  if there was a 

18

different decision as to the constitutional question, it 

19

didn't answer the question of qualified immunity.  And, 

20

of course, it's Eleventh Circuit law.  Why would we be 

21

deciding it. 

22

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, we don't think 

23

that you should send it back precisely because three 

24

judges  for several reasons, but among them, that 

25

three judges below read their own precedent to say that

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this was not unconstitutional.  We think in the 

2

qualified immunity context, what this Court has said is 

3

that a reasonable official should not be penalized for 

4

picking the losing side of a judicial controversy.  The 

5

Eleventh Circuit construed its  its own precedent to 

6

authorize or at least not make unconstitutional this 

7

action.  And that is enough.  Under this Court's 

8

precedents, an employee should be able to look to the 

9

precedent of his own court, of his own circuit, 

10

particularly when what that court is doing is not 

11

interpreting something for the first time, but 

12

construing its own precedent. 

13

 Mr. Chief Justice, you asked if there were 

14

other cases.  We think Morris v. Crow is enough.  But we 

15

also think that Green v. Barrett, which is the only 

16

postGarcetti case, and it's cited in both of the red 

17

briefs, is even a stronger precedent and actually 

18

reinforces everything that was at issue in Morris v. 

19

Crow.  In Green v. Barrett, that was testimony at a 

20

court hearing.  And I think the rule coming out of the 

21

Eleventh Circuit, which a reasonable employee could have 

22

relied on, was that testimony, when the motive is to 

23

comply with the subpoena and the subject matter was 

24

related to information you learned on your job, that was 

25

not protected even if it's presented in the course of a

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

civil deposition or if it's presented at a court 

2

hearing. 

3

 And so Your Honor, we really don't think 

4

there is any need to  to send this case back.  We 

5

don't think that Groh or Hope are cases that are 

6

reasonably helpful to  to Petitioner here, because 

7

those are cases in which the courts of appeals actually 

8

decided the constitutional question against the 

9

Petitioner.  Now, they did find qualified immunity and 

10

this Court reversed.  But it would be very unusual and I 

11

think unprecedented in this Court's history to find a 

12

situation in which the court of appeals actually found 

13

no Constitutional violation and yet this Court denied 

14

qualified immunity.  So we don't think there is any need 

15

to send it back. 

16

 If there are no further questions.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. LUTHER J. STRANGE, III 

20

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BURROW 

21

 MR. STRANGE: 

22

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

23

 As attorney general, I stand here before you 

24

with a particular interest, a keen interest really, in 

25

the situations that both the public employees in this

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case find themselves:  Mr. Lane, who we argue is 

2

entitled to First Amendment protection because he was 

3

talking about a matter as a citizen, a matter of public 

4

concern; and Mr. Franks, who we believe is entitled to 

5

rely on sovereign  I mean, qualified immunity because 

6

he was relying on the precedent of this circuit and with 

7

the law in this area was not clearly established. 

8

 As attorney general, I get to supervise 

9

these people every day and we depend on people like 

10

Mr. Lane or people who find themselves in that 

11

situation, who are willing to and need to be able to 

12

testify in cases involving public corruption.  And the 

13

case at the heart  the situation at the heart of this 

14

case was one of the most egregious public corruption 

15

situations in Alabama's history.  It led to a total 

16

rewrite of our public corruption laws and our ethics 

17

laws.  And if we can't depend on people like Mr. Lane or 

18

people in a situation like Mr. Lane to feel free to 

19

testify as citizens on matters of public concern 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why should it matter 

21

then if an employee's job is to investigate corruption? 

22

If that's their job and they are called by you to 

23

testify at a corruption trial and then they are fired 

24

for it, should it really matter that it's part of their 

25

job or not?

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. STRANGE: 

Your Honor, I think it should. 

2

And I think the  as we point out in our brief, I think 

3

the Court has the right rule and the right test in 

4

Garcetti, because the Court clearly recognized there are 

5

a group of employees who are paid by money appropriated 

6

by the government to do jobs exactly like you described, 

7

to investigate cases.  Child welfare caseworkers and so 

8

forth, they are in a category that has a less  we've 

9

already made the decision, the Court has, that they have 

10

not the entire free speech rights that the First 

11

Amendment allows to employees. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that seems 

13

counterintuitive to me.  Why do we let  why do we put 

14

people at risk for telling the truth? 

15
16
17

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Well, I wouldn't characterize 

it 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

To tell the truth about 

18

something?  And I'm assuming if they lie, they can be 

19

fired.  But why are we 

20

 MR. STRANGE: 

Well, I agree with my 

21

colleague from the Department of Justice.  There are 

22

very  lots of legitimate reasons that a court  I 

23

think in Garcetti, the Court acknowledged this, that why 

24

the government has to supervise, has to take a look at 

25

the overall 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Look, I certainly understand 

2

people  government being able to tell people don't 

3

go out and talk to the newspapers about this, don't go 

4

out and talk about X publicly, because we should be able 

5

to control those kinds of disclosures.  But why are we 

6

putting people at risk for doing  telling fundamental 

7

truth in a public forum like a trial? 

8
9

 MR. STRANGE: 

Well, I think certainly as the 

top prosecutor in the State of Alabama, I expect and 

10

insist the value of the testimony is that they are 

11

telling the truth. 

12

 The question I guess is, are they at risk 

13

for doing that?  And I think in  a public employee in 

14

the category of Mr. Lane, they shouldn't be.  I think 

15

they are protected under the First Amendment because 

16

they are speaking as citizens on matters of public 

17

concern.  Police officers, child welfare folks, we 

18

expect them to tell the truth, too, but they are in a 

19

slightly different category.  And as my colleague from 

20

DOJ said, they have other protections.  And I hope in 

21

Alabama they get a medal for telling the truth, however 

22

the truth comes out. 

23

 But I'd like to get to one thing that I think 

24

helps settle some  a number of these issues, and 

25

that's what we say in our brief, which is the core

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

holding of the Garcetti test.  And maybe it will 

2

clarify.  We think it will answer most of these 

3

questions as they arise.  And the fundamental test is 

4

this, as we say in our brief:  Whether the employee's 

5

job duties encompassed the speech in question.  That's 

6

not an exact test, but it's a test that certainly in our 

7

view protects Mr. Lane in this situation.  He was a 

8

director of a program for atrisk youth.  He wasn't 

9

anticipated or expected to testify in any forum. 

10

Certainly he is knowledgeable about his job and what 

11

happened there.  He was a valuable witness in this case. 

12

 Let me switch over to the question of 

13

qualified immunity, because I take a slightly different 

14

position.  There, I think that people in Mr. Franks's 

15

position, people who have to supervise employees, are 

16

entitled to rely on the law of their circuit.  Because I 

17

agree with, I think, the Chief Justice, we can't expect 

18

employees who have to make decisions all the time to be 

19

aware of what's going on in other circuits and so forth. 

20

We don't think the Eleventh Circuit got it right.  We 

21

think if they had applied the test that I just 

22

articulated, the core, they would have come out possibly 

23

differently. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But what about the 

Martinez case?  I mean, Morris talks about it in a way

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that suggests that it's quite different.  And it seems 

2

closer to the Petitioner's situation than Morris. 

3

 MR. STRANGE: 

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, you 

4

know, I think if you're in Franks's position or if you 

5

have employees like that, there may be reasonable 

6

variables  maybe that case had made sense.  Maybe the 

7

Morris case made sense.  What I think happens, I think 

8

the Eleventh Circuit looked at its previous  they 

9

picked the Morris case.  They looked at their previous 

10

precedent, and they thought what the Court had said in 

11

Martinez  I mean in  I'm sorry, in Garcetti, 

12

applied.  They went further than Garcetti did.  They 

13

talked about testimony.  They went beyond Garcetti. 

14

They thought it was reasonable in what they had said 

15

before and they made this decision.  And I think Franks 

16

has got to be able to rely on that. 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you think if 

18

every other circuit has come out the other way and you 

19

have what  well, let's take the dictum.  There is an 

20

Eleventh Circuit case that, it's dictum.  Are the 

21

employees supposed to  are they protected by following 

22

that, or do they have to follow the consensus in the 

23

other circuits? 

24
25

 MR. STRANGE: 

I think they are protected, 

Your Honor, if they rely on the law of their circuit

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unless the law is clearly established by this Court. 

2

For example, I can't picture a situation where the 

3

Eleventh Circuit  and that's not this situation, 

4

because I think the Eleventh Circuit made its 

5

determination based on language that it felt like it 

6

could hang its hat on in Garcetti.  We think that was 

7

wrong, but I don't think it's so unreasonable that they 

8

couldn't rely on it. 

9

 And if it's something that's reasonable for 

10

the Court to rely on even though there's a split in the 

11

circuits, I don't think it's clearly established, in 

12

which case I think a person who is trying in good faith 

13

to, you know, manage his government employees to rely 

14

on. 

15
16

 Well, if there are no further questions, 
thank you, Your Honor.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. WAGGONER 

20

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FRANKS 

21

 MR. WAGGONER: 

22
23

Thank you, General. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The Court should affirm the Eleventh 

24

Circuit's decision on the First Amendment issue.  But 

25

regardless of how it rules, we agree with the United

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

States and the State of Alabama that Dr. Franks is still 

2

entitled to qualified immunity from damages in his 

3

individual capacity in this case. 

4

 There is no reason for the Court to depart 

5

from its precedent, primarily in the Garcetti decision, 

6

to affirm the Eleventh Circuit.  The issuance of a 

7

subpoena, the Court has already rejected in Garcetti 

8

that the forum of speech is determinative.  So we do not 

9

believe that the issuance of a subpoena in and of itself 

10

entitles a speaker to protection of the First Amendment. 

11

 It is the character of the speech, rather, 

12

that  that has to be looked at to determine whether 

13

the speech is  is protected under the First Amendment. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Garcetti turned on what 

15

were  what were the job duties of the particular 

16

person, and there the job duty was to investigate.  Here, 

17

the distinction is, everybody agrees, that it's not part 

18

of the job description of Lane. 

19

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Yes, Your Honor.  In 

20

Garcetti, the Court declined to set out a comprehensive 

21

framework for defining of an employee's job duties when 

22

there is room for serious debate.  That is why, in this 

23

case, we have suggested to the Court that it adopt the 

24

framework that we have set out that was originally 

25

articulated in Garcetti about whether there is a citizen

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

analog for the speech. 
 The Eleventh Circuit in this case held that 

3

it was not distinctly one of the job duties of Mr. Lane 

4

to testify; however, his testimony was inseparable from 

5

his job duties, and we do believe that when he 

6

testified, that it was pursuant to his official duties. 

7

 There is a gap in  in Garcetti about 

8

the  the definition where the Court declined to set 

9

out a comprehensive framework where there is room for 

10
11

debate.  And that's 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I  I still don't 

12

understand or didn't understand what it is you're 

13

saying.  If he testifies, and you don't  you want to 

14

keep the corruption secret.  You know, you don't want to 

15

reveal it and he testifies truthfully and reveals it. 

16

Can he be disciplined for that? 

17

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Your Honor, under the citizen 

18

analog test or inquiry that the Court began to 

19

articulate in Garcetti, if the testimony is factual, 

20

based solely on the job duties, as it was here, 

21

inseparable from the job duties, and it is information 

22

that a citizen would not know, that only the testifier 

23

would know, then that is not protected speech under 

24

Garcetti. 

25

 It's not the subpoena, and it's not

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because it's testimony.  It is the character of the 

2

speech and whether a 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what is he 

4

what is he supposed to do?  I mean, he gets a subpoena, 

5

and the  the other side or somebody, this independent 

6

counsel, says, you know, what's going on?  What do you 

7

know about, you know, from your job responsibilities? 

8

What happened or did you  is this person taking money? 

9

Is this person showing up?  What's he supposed to do? 

10

 He says, gosh, if I  if I answer, I'm 

11

going to lose my job or could, and if I don't or answer 

12

falsely  the Fifth Amendment protects him from 

13

incriminating himself.  It doesn't protect the 

14

department he works for from being incriminated. 

15

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, we would 

16

never suggest that anybody not comply with a subpoena, 

17

comply with an investigation, or testify truthfully. 

18
19
20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But you are 

suggesting he can be fired if he does it. 
 MR. WAGGONER: 

If  if it does not offend 

21

the First Amendment, and we believe that's why we're 

22

here.  We're talking about the Garcetti precedent and 

23

whether the free speech under the First Amendment clause 

24

to the Constitution is implicated.  And as this Court 

25

said 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Is Garcetti right on 

2

that point as it relates to testimony?  That  that's 

3

really the issue that's of public concern.  Is Garcetti 

4

right?  Is the line between it being a part of your 

5

duties or not sensical in any way? 

6

 MR. WAGGONER: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
We've all agreed that 

8

getting fired for admitting something, doing it in  in 

9

an improper way, a whole host of things can get you 

10

fired.  But if someone is called to testify truthfully 

11

about a matter of public concern, and they testify that 

12

way, should they be able to be fired under the First 

13

Amendment? 

14

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Only, Your Honor, if the 

15

well, of course, as the Court observed in Garcetti, 

16

there's a powerful network of legislative enactments 

17

that  that prohibit retaliating against an employee or 

18

penalizing an employee for testifying truthfully. 

19

 Certainly, witness tampering laws, 

20

obstruction of justice laws, whistleblower laws, Section 

21

1985, which Mr. Lane originally had a count in his 

22

complaint under, but we do believe that under Garcetti, 

23

you have to first look at whether the employee is 

24

speaking as a citizen. 

25

 The Petitioner and some of the  the other

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

parties here conflate the citizen analysis that the 

2

Court articulated in Garcetti and the public concern 

3

analysis.  Of course, this was a matter of public 

4

concern, this trial that Mr. Lane testified in.  But you 

5

have to look at, as  again, as you held in Garcetti, 

6

that whether or not there was speech by a citizen.  And 

7

you have to look at those two 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But are you suggesting that 

when somebody learns something from his job, that that 
means it's not speech by a citizen? 
 MR. WAGGONER: 

Only if  it depends on the 

12

speech that  that follows from knowing something on 

13

your job.  The Court has long articulated speech that is 

14

close to the heart of the First Amendment, whether it is 

15

opinion speech, whether it is engaging in public debate, 

16

whether public dialogue, expressing viewpoints, 

17

criticizing the government, criticizing superiors.  But 

18

factual testimony based only on knowledge that an 

19

employee has pursuant to their official duties would not 

20

be protected speech because of the character of the 

21

speech and because that information is only gathered as 

22

part of their official duties. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if that  what if the 

24

same information  what if the employee writes a 

25

newspaper article or gives an interview and reveals the

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

same information?  Would that be subject to Pickering? 
 MR. WAGGONER: 

Well, it depends on the 

character of the speech, Your Honor.  And if 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what if it's about 

5

corruption in my government?  In the place where I work, 

6

there are a lot of noshow jobs, and so the person 

7

writes an article that says that.  Is that a matter 

8

of 

9

 MR. WAGGONER: 

That sounds like  that 

10

sounds like protected speech, as in Pickering, Your 

11

Honor.  That's a  the classic example of an employee 

12

writing a letter to the editor criticizing the 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, but when he's using 

14

factual matter that he only knows because he's an 

15

employee in a particular branch of government. 

16

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Then that would not be 

17

protected speech.  It's not the forum  under Garcetti, 

18

it's not the forum that is dispositive.  It's the 

19

character of the speech and whether speaking as an 

20

employee and whether just relaying information that the 

21

employee possesses pursuant to their official duties. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

When you say it's 

23

protected, does that  you mean under the  it 

24

qualifies under the first step in Garcetti.  It doesn't 

25

mean that he can't be disciplined under the Pickering

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

analysis that follows that. 
 MR. WAGGONER: 

Well, if it's not citizen 

3

speech under Garcetti, then you don't get to public 

4

concern, and then you don't get to Pickering balancing. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right.  But even if 

6

it is, you could say that it is  when you say it's 

7

protected, you mean that just it gets to the Pickering 

8

analysis, not that  not that the employee is 

9
10
11

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Correct.  It meets the 

speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concern. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So your  your position is 

12

you cannot speak as a citizen if  if your speech 

13

consists of disclosing material that you knew as an 

14

employee.  Why is that true? 

15

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Your Honor, because, as in 

16

as in Garcetti, where the Court said that when you're 

17

speaking pursuant to official job duties 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but this is not an 

19

official job duty.  It's just a matter that I know of 

20

because of my job.  Why does that mean that when I 

21

disclose that, I am not speaking as a citizen? 

22

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Yes, Your Honor.  It would 

23

also depend on the speech itself and the character of 

24

the speech.  If  if you engage in opinion testimony, 

25

writing letters to the editor, then 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MR. WAGGONER: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, I'm just 
 the possibility of a 
I'm just talking about 

4

facts, no opinions, just facts.  But I learned those 

5

facts on the job as an employee, and I  is it your 

6

position that whenever you are reciting those facts, you 

7

cannot be speaking as a citizen? 

8

 MR. WAGGONER: 

9

speech, Your Honor. 

10

That would not be protected 

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But then, I mean, we've said 

11

several times things like this:  Government employees 

12

are often in the best position to know what ails the 

13

agencies for which they work.  In other words, expecting 

14

that people will know things because they work in a 

15

place and that they can take what they know as a result 

16

of working in a place and go out and be a citizen. 

17
18
19

 MR. WAGGONER: 

And that is certainly true, 

Your Honor. 
 And when an employee, as in Pickering, takes 

20

that knowledge that they have gained in their public 

21

employment and engages in the speech, type of speech, 

22

that is close to the heart of the First Amendment when 

23

you're engaging in public debate addressing 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But in Pickering it was 

something that anybody could know.  It didn't depend

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

upon the job, learning on the job.  I thought in 

2

Pickering the 

3

 MR. WAGGONER: 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Some 
 any citizen could have 

5

known that information.  Here, the knowledge comes only 

6

because of the public employment. 

7

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Yes, Your Honor.  In 

8

Pickering, I believe some of the  some of the 

9

information was certainly subject to public knowledge. 

10

And Your Honor is right that here the testimony given by 

11

Mr. Lane was inseparable from his job duties.  It was 

12

it was knowledge that he gained by his interactions with 

13

his subordinate employee discussing with her the terms 

14

and conditions of her employment, and he merely  as 

15

the United States observed, he merely relayed that 

16

information in  in the  in the trial. 

17

 But because he was not expressing 

18

viewpoints, engaging in opinion testimony, the  the 

19

forum of  of the  the trial did not endow that 

20

speech which  with constitutional protection. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me make sure I 

22

understand what you're saying.  Two employees know that 

23

there is someone who has a no shot  noshow job where 

24

they work.  One of them writes a letter to the editor 

25

and says:  John Doe has a noshow job.  One of them

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

testifies pursuant to subpoena in a criminal trial: 

2

John Doe has a noshow job. 

3

 Is  is it your view that Pickering does 

4

not apply in either of those situations, or it applies 

5

in  in the latter but not in the former? 

6

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Pickering does not apply. 

7

The Pickering balancing does not apply in either of 

8

those situations. 

9
10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Neither one. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Really?  Well, let's 

11

say it's  his job is to investigate corruption in the 

12

agency.  And he writes a letter saying:  Here's all  I 

13

have these, you know, facts; here's all this corruption 

14

in the agency, and  and he writes it to the  a 

15

letter to the editor.  Surely he can be disciplined for 

16

that.  I mean, let's say the  his superiors were not 

17

ready to call off the investigation at that point. 

18

 MR. WAGGONER: 

If his letter to the editor 

19

merely relayed factual testimony that he possessed only 

20

pursuant to his official job duties, that would not be 

21

protected speech. 

22

 Now, in the letter to the editor, certainly 

23

like in Pickering, where the  the employee goes beyond 

24

that and expresses views, criticizes the school board, 

25

and that sort of 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Where  where  where did 

2

you get this notion that the First Amendment only 

3

applies to the expression of views and not to the 

4

conveyance of  of facts? 

5

 MR. WAGGONER: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So we 
All of us can be protected 

7

from knowing certain facts and that would not violate 

8

the First Amendment? 

9

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Yes, Your Honor.  We believe 

10

that that test is  at least was begun to be 

11

articulated in Garcetti, where the Court said that where 

12

speech has no relevant citizen analog, that it is not 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 MR. WAGGONER: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So the government 
 protected speech. 
 can presumably prohibit 

16

anybody teaching, what, economics, the facts of  of 

17

economics? 

18
19

 MR. WAGGONER: 

No, Your Honor.  And I  I 

believe 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

 MR. WAGGONER: 

The facts of World War II. 
No, Your Honor.  We  I 

22

we are talking about a  a  in a different context. 

23

I know 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't know where you get 

it from.  I've never heard of this distinction, the

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

First Amendment protects only opinions and not facts. 

2

I've never heard of it. 

3

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Well, Your Honor, we believe 

4

that it's  it's a longtime precedent of this Court 

5

that speech, certainly in the Hustler, Falwell v. 

6

Hustler case, where it talked about speech that is close 

7

to the heart of the First Amendment, expressing 

8

viewpoints, engaging in opinion, public debate, that 

9

that is certainly protected speech. 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I thought it 

11

was just because the facts came from your employment. 

12

If you're conducting an investigation and you find out 

13

that, you know, soandso is taking a bribe because 

14

that's your job, I don't know that you have a First 

15

Amendment right to go out and say that, when, for 

16

example, your superior would say, oh, we are about to 

17

set up a sting operation, we are going to get the  the 

18

goods on her.  And you say, well, I think I'd rather 

19

write a letter to the editor saying that she  she has 

20

been caught, you know, taking a bribe. 

21

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Well, Your Honor, we are 

22

saying that speech would not be protected if it is 

23

merely relaying information that an employee has 

24

pursuant to their official duties and when that 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And that wouldn't make

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

any difference whether it was fact, opinion, views.  I 

2

thought your distinction was  was clear.  You are 

3

saying if you learn the information on the job, then 

4

you're not protected, and it doesn't matter whether it's 

5

opinion, expression, as long as what you were speaking 

6

about is something that you've learned on the job.  I 

7

thought that was your position. 

8
9

 MR. WAGGONER: 

I  maybe I should clarify, 

Your Honor. 

10

 It  it is our position that if it is 

11

information that is learned on the job and is not 

12

relayed in just a factual context and it  and it goes 

13

into that speech that is closer to the heart of the 

14

First Amendment, then it would be protected speech, Your 

15

Honor. 

16

 If it was the 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Give me an example of 

18

an opinion that would be protected First Amendment 

19

speech, as you said, and yet is based on facts you 

20

learned only because of your public employment. 

21

 MR. WAGGONER: 

Your Honor, I would  I 

22

would suggest something close to the Pickering fact 

23

situation where a letter to the editor was written that 

24

in  that contained opinion speech, debate speech, 

25

critical speech.  And assuming that that was based

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

solely on information that the employee had pursuant to 

2

their official duties, then that would be protected 

3

speech. 

4

 I think the  under the citizen analogue 

5

analysis, there is a pretty limited range of speech that 

6

would not be protected.  But it would apply here, where 

7

Mr. Lane testified pursuant to his  his official 

8

duties and relayed information that he only had because 

9

of his interactions with Miss Schmitz and it was  and 

10

it was solely factual testimony, that that is not 

11

protected speech, even though a subpoena was issued 

12

because, as the Court said in Garcetti, the forum is not 

13

dispositive. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But if I could just 

15

understand what you're saying.  Are  are you saying 

16

that, no matter what the employee's official duties are, 

17

as long as he gets information because he is a public 

18

employee and he is in a workplace, that that's what 

19

matters? 

20

 I mean, I know all kinds of things about a 

21

workplace that go beyond exactly what my official 

22

responsibilities are.  So if I communicate things that I 

23

learn in a workplace, but, you know, I have nothing to 

24

do with prosecuting corruption or with investigating 

25

corruption, do I count as an employee, or do I not count

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

as an employee in that context? 
 MR. WAGGONER: 

I think the question there, 

3

Your Honor, as the Court articulated in Garcetti, is 

4

it  is it pursuant to your official job duties?  For 

5

example, in this case, Mr. Lane, his official duties 

6

were to manage and hire and fire his subordinate 

7

employees, in this case, Miss Schmitz.  So he was 

8

acting  and nobody  nobody here disputes that he was 

9

acting pursuant to his official duties when he did that. 

10

And because he  he testified solely to those facts, 

11

his testimony in Court was inseparable from those job 

12

duties, then his speech was not protected. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

14

 Mr. Singh, you have 5 minutes remaining. 

15

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TEJINDER SINGH. 

16
17

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. SINGH: 

Thank you.  I'd like to begin, 

18

if I might, by just talking about the subject of 

19

qualified immunity and the import of the Eleventh 

20

Circuit and what it did and didn't decide. 

21

 The Eleventh Circuit clearly has decided 

22

that in 2009, when Petitioner was fired, the law has not 

23

clearly established a right to testify in the Eleventh 

24

Circuit.  That was decided in this case and so I think 

25

there is no point to remanding it.  Nothing about this

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court's decision in 2014 is going to change the Eleventh 

2

Circuit's belief about what the law was in 2009.  And so 

3

I think you should decide the question.  On that issue, 

4

I think it's very telling that both of the sovereigns in 

5

this case say that we win under a straightforward 

6

application of Garcetti cited in 2006.  You look at 

7

Respondent Burrow's brief and repeatedly she urges, 

8

don't make a new rule of law; just apply the rule of law 

9

you had in Garcetti.  The United States makes the same 

10

argument.  Page 16 of its brief argues that, "The 

11

holding of Garcetti was especially clear about the 

12

factors a Court should consider in deciding whether an 

13

employee testified pursuant to his responsibilities." 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

15

Circuit really got it wrong. 

16

 MR. SINGH: 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So the Eleventh 

Absolutely, Your Honor. 
But it's still the 

18

precedent that governs in this situation unless you're 

19

going to have the employees analyze the law in the other 

20

circuits or unless you're going to have the employees 

21

look at the Eleventh Circuit opinion and say, I know 

22

that's what it says, but it's wrong. 

23

 MR. SINGH: 

Your Honor, I think if Supreme 

24

Court precedent is clear, then contrary to Eleventh 

25

Circuit precedent shouldn't be controlling and employees

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

shouldn't be entitled to rely on it, and that's 

2

certainly the implication of what this Court said in 

3

Hope v. Pelzer.  In Hope v. Pelzer, one of the arguments 

4

that the defendants made was that there were a variety 

5

of district court decisions that supported their view of 

6

the law.  And this Court said that the import of 

7

judicial precedent is a function of the judicial 

8

hierarchy.  And when, as here, Supreme Court precedent 

9

sets the rules, Eleventh Circuit precedent can't supply 

10
11

a contrary rule. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you're requiring 

12

the government employee in this case to be a better 

13

analyzer of Supreme Court precedent than the three 

14

Eleventh Circuit judges. 

15

 MR. SINGH: 

Your Honor, I think that that is 

16

not what we're requiring, because our argument in this 

17

case is supplemented by what I think is an equally 

18

strong argument that Eleventh Circuit precedent really 

19

did not support this outcome, that the Court went very, 

20

very far out on a limb in this case. 

21

 And I might just talk about the one case 

22

that the Solicitor General mentioned, the Green v. 

23

Barrett case.  This is an unpublished case issued in 

24

2007 in which the chief jailer of a jail attended a 

25

hearing at a court, and it's not even 100 percent clear

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

why this hearing was at a court.  It was an emergency 

2

hearing convened to decide whether a particular prison 

3

over which the jailer had responsibility was a safe 

4

place to keep a particularly dangerous inmate.  And she 

5

was fired after that testimony. 

6

 There is no indication that it was even a 

7

public hearing.  There's no indication that it was the 

8

sort of judicial proceedings we're talking about here. 

9

And I think when you compare that case, again, to the 

10

precedential decision in Martinez in 1992, no one could 

11

have looked at those cases and come to the conclusion 

12

that it's really a good idea for a State employer to 

13

fire a Federal witness in retaliation for their truthful 

14

testimony. 

15

 That's the conclusion that Franks would have 

16

had to be able to reach in 2009.  You would have had to 

17

examine the body of this Court's precedents, which 

18

consistently have held that even knowledge gained in the 

19

course of employment is subject to First Amendment 

20

protection.  That's been the rule in Mr. Pickering's 

21

case, where he talked about how his work at the high 

22

school was the reason he knew that certain statements 

23

were false.  It was the case in the Mount Healthy case 

24

where all a teacher did was disclose a memorandum, an 

25

internal memorandum, to a radio station.  That's been

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

established since the 1960s.  And there was nothing that 

2

Franks could have looked to or pointed to in 2009 that 


3


would have said firing somebody in retaliation for 


4


truthful testimony in a Federal corruption trial is 


5


permissible.  Thank you. 

6

 If there are no further questions.
