CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument first this morning -- this morning in Case

5

10-779, William Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont, v.

6

IMS Health Incorporated.

7

Ms. Asay.

8

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIDGET C. ASAY

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MS. ASAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

Under State and Federal law, doctors write

13

prescriptions for their patients to allow them access to

14

drugs that the government deems too dangerous for

15

unrestricted sale.

16

decide whether this information that they're compelled

17

to provide to pharmacies may be used in marketing that

18

is directed at them.

19

Vermont's law allow doctors to

Drug companies would certainly like to have

20

this information for marketing, but they have no First

21

Amendment right to demand it, just as they have no right

22

to demand access to the doctor's tax returns, his

23

patient files, or to their competitors' business

24

records.

25

Vermont's law does not regulate the content

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the marketing pitches and the advertising that drug

2

companies provide about their products or their

3

competitors' products.

4

information that's created in a highly regulated regime

5

of prescription drugs and in the context of the

6

doctor-patient relationship.

7

It regulates access to this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The purpose -- the

8

purpose is to prevent sales representatives from

9

contacting particular physicians, right?

10

MS. ASAY:

I disagree, Your Honor.

The

11

purpose of the statute is to let doctors decide whether

12

sales representatives will have access to this inside

13

information about what they have been prescribing to

14

their patients.

15

that what drug companies do is track and monitor doctors

16

very closely to watch when they switch drugs, to watch

17

the trends by which they -- doctors prescribe, by

18

gender, by age.

19

target and to direct the marketing projects -­

20
21

And what -- what the record shows is

And all that information is used to

JUSTICE SCALIA:
other purposes, right?

22

MS. ASAY:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MS. ASAY:

25

But they could use it for

The pharmaceutical manufacturers?
Right.

Under this statute they may use

it for some limited purposes for clinical trials.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So what the Chief Justice

2

suggested is right, that the purpose is to stop them

3

from using it in order to market their drugs?

4
5

MS. ASAY:

The purpose is to allow doctors

to decide whether the -­

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MS. ASAY:

8

That's right.

-- the information should be

available.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's right, but

10

that -- that is an impediment to their using it for the

11

marketing of drugs.

12

impediment on it.

13

I mean, it doesn't necessarily make it bad, but -- but

14

let's not quibble over what the purpose is.

15

You're -- you're placing that
Isn't that the obvious purpose of it?

MS. ASAY:

As with any information that

16

the -- that might inform a marketing campaign, not

17

having the information may be -- make their marketing

18

less effective or make it different.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's the purpose.

20

the purpose of it, to prevent them from using this

21

information to market their drugs.

22

MS. ASAY:

That's

Again, Your Honor, the purpose is

23

to allow doctors to make the decision, and doctors may

24

want to allow its use or not allow its use.

25

law -­
5

Alderson Reporting Company

But the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's only for that use

2

that you interpose the requirement that the doctor

3

consent.

4

doctor's consent, right?

For all other uses you don't require the

5

MS. ASAY:

The only -- the consent

6

requirement in this statute goes to the use for

7

marketing and also to the sale by the pharmacy, and that

8

sale may be for other purposes as well, so there -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Asay, are any of the

10

other purposes, like for insurance purposes, cases where

11

the pharmacist is paid for giving out the prescriber

12

information?

13

the pharmacists to get this information.

14

other, others who have access, do any of them also pay

15

the pharmacists?

16

Here what they call data miners are paying

MS. ASAY:

In the case of

Your Honor, there's two sort of

17

answers to that.

The first is that, with respect to

18

pharmacies, the record shows here that the only place

19

that the pharmacies disseminate their information is to

20

the data vendors, and that is a commercial sale, and it

21

is primarily intended for the marketing purpose.

22

Insurers do have information about doctors' prescribing

23

practices and patient information.

24

internally from their own claims and their relationships

25

with doctors and patients.

They have that

So insurers are not -- do

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not need to buy the data from pharmacies.

2

without purchasing it.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They have it

So -- so the data is not

4

private in the sense that the physician who prescribes

5

knows that nobody will know what he is prescribing and

6

how much he prescribes and how often, because there are

7

a lot of people who do know that, right?

8
9
10

MS. ASAY:

That's correct, Your Honor, there

are people who know what the doctor prescribes and what
the patient has received.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the only thing it

12

assures the physician, the physician who prescribes, is

13

that he won't be bothered by drug companies who, on the

14

basis of their knowledge of information which other

15

people have, approach him in order to market their

16

drugs?

17

physician, right?

18

That's basically all it assures the prescribing

MS. ASAY:

It assures the prescribing

19

physician that his information about prescribing

20

practices will not be used for marketing without his

21

consent.

22

It's like the difference -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And, and he could achieve

23

the same objective, could he not, by simply refusing to

24

talk to the marketer.

25

I want to talk to you about a new drug, he says:

When the marketer says, you know,

7

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't talk to drug manufacturers and marketers.

2

MS. ASAY:

He could not achieve the same

3

result, Your Honor.

What the record shows is that

4

doctors are particularly concerned about having access

5

to the best information and the most complete

6

information to make decisions for their patients.

7

this data, as was discussed by Dr. Granday below, by

8

Kesselheim, by Mr. Erhari, the former sales

9

representative -- they all discussed how the data ends

And

11

receive.

12

So they receive less -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

One of the Respondents

13

argues that the statute would permit, does permit, the

14

use of this information for what they call a counter­

15

detailing effort.

16

Is that correct?

MS. ASAY:

It is not correct, Your Honor, to

17

the extent that Respondents have suggested that

18

Vermont's academic detailing program, which is called

19

the evidence-based education program, uses this data.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

That wasn't really my

21

question.

22

If Vermont wanted to do that, the University of Vermont

23

or some other entity wanted to do that, would the

24

statute permit it?

25

My question was does the statute permit it.

MS. ASAY:

Well, the statute would not
8

permit the sale for that purpose, which is a separate

2

provision of the statute, because academic detailing is

not an exemption.

Could the researcher then

general public, and sell that to the general public, to

17

the newspapers and so forth?
MS. ASAY:

18

We do not believe so, Your Honor,

19

because of the background regulations that govern this

20

information, including Pharmacy Board Rule 20, which we

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You answered my question

2

earlier that they don't sell it to anyone else.

3

why I was trying to clarify your answer to Justice

4

Kennedy, because you told me the only sale -- the

5

pharmacists, they sell this to the data miners, they do

6

not sell it to the other people.

7

answering Justice Kennedy's question, yes, they sell it

8

to universities.

9

MS. ASAY:

That's

But now you're

I apologize, Your Honor, if I was

10

not clear.

11

the pharmacies do not sell it to researchers.

13

as a factual matter, they do not.

14

As a factual matter, we know absolutely that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I had
But

How does it increase the

15

prescribing physician's right of privacy that the data

16

about his prescribing can only be given away but can't

17

be sold?

18

privacy?

19

Does that make him feel happier about his

MS. ASAY:

What it allows the doctor to do

20

is to avoid an intrusive and invasive marketing

21

practice.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He can do that by saying:

I don't want to talk to you.
MS. ASAY:

The doctor cannot -- can shut off

any communication and any information from the
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pharmaceutical companies by slamming the door on the

2

detailers, but that's not necessarily in the interest of

3

doctors or patients.

4

And what this -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That may well be, but then

5

just don't tell me that the purpose is to protect their

6

privacy.

Now you're arguing a totally different

7

purpose:

It makes it easier for the physician to cut

8

off approaches by drug companies that want to sell

9

drugs.

If that's the purpose of this statute, it's

10

quite different from protecting his privacy.

His

11

privacy isn't protected by saying you can't sell it but

12

you can give it away.

13

MS. ASAY:

Your Honor, I think the

14

legislature here was using privacy to refer to the

15

autonomy interest that everyone has to some degree in

16

controlling the flow or the use of information about

17

them.

18

19

interest in the aggregation of information on an FBI rap

20

sheet.

21

This Court recognized in the Reporters Committee

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, that -­

22

assuming there's some form of privacy that relates to

23

not being harassed because there's certainly legislative

24

record of doctors or groups of doctors testifying to

25

feeling harassed by detailers, if Thompson requires a
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

less restrictive method, why does this have to be an

2

opt-in rather than an opt-out?

3

I call up and say I, don't want you to have this

4

information?

5

Because isn't an opt-out

So isn't an opt-out less restrictive?
MS. ASAY:

An opt-out would not protect the

6

privacy interests as much because it would assume that

7

doctors want to consent.

8

the statute is -­

9

I would like to say that here

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but, given the

10

restrictions on speech, why is that a bad thing?

11

Meaning you don't really intend to tell us that the

12

State couldn't and wouldn't -- just like we got all of

13

MS. ASAY:

Well, in fact, Your Honor, that's

exactly what the State does.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's another -­

4

there's another purpose that I would like you to comment

5

on, and that is the, the State is interested in

6

promoting the sale of generic drugs and correspondingly

7

to reduce the sale of brand name drugs.

8

the purpose, why doesn't that run up against what this

9

Court has said that you can't, you can't lower the

And if that's

10

decibel level of one speaker so that another speaker, in

11

this case the generics, can be heard better?

12

MS. ASAY:

The State does have an interest

13

in reducing health care costs here.

14

about this statute is the mechanism by which it allows

15

doctors to decide what information and what kind of

16

marketing they want, and it's different because what

17

it's about is access to information in this highly

18

regulated area.

19

who prescribes a nonprescription drug and a patient who

20

can take that information, walk into the pharmacy with a

21

$20 bill and leave with their medication, and no one has

22

learned anything about what the doctor prescribed for

23

the patient, about the patient's concerns, or the

24

doctor's concerns.

I don't understand that answer that you gave

to the Chief Justice.

11

MS. ASAY:

It's not a restriction on speech

12

because it's a restriction only on the access to the

13

information that the pharmaceutical manufacturers would

14

like to use to inform their advertising, and it's only

15

in play if the doctors have objected to the use.

say, you know, our product is much better than the

2

generic; our quality control is -- you know, whatever.

3

There are arguments on both sides of those things.

4

you are making it more difficult for them to speak by

5

restricting access to information that would enable

6

their speech to be most effective.

7

MS. ASAY:

And

And -- their speech would be more

8

effective if they had access to patient information, if

9

they had access to their competitors' trade secrets.

10

There's certainly other information available that they

11

would like to use in marketing, but is not available to

12

them by law, and it -- it's our position that in the

13

same way they do not have a right to demand access to

information about the doctor's prescribing practices

without his consent.

In our court of appeals brief,

of the statute as restricting both the sale of the

information and the use for marketing.

MS. ASAY:

It is my representation that -­

18

that we did not say anything contrary to that, Your

19

Honor; and that it really was not pressed below.

with it, either.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING the PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Vermont statute protects important

7

interests that the Vermont legislature could recognize

8

in physician autonomy and control over information that

9

concerns them.

When a patient brings a prescription to

10

a pharmacy, after that point the patient information is

11

protected under HIPAA and under State law.

12

two primary actors in that transaction -- the physician

13

and the pharmacy.

14

subject to regulation under a comprehensive, closed

15

system for the distribution of drugs.

16

That leaves

Both are professionals, both are

Prior to the time this statute was enacted,

17

the pharmacy had complete control over the disposition

18

of that information.

19

physician, the prescriber, on an equal footing with

20

respect to the pharmacy -- with the pharmacy, with

21

respect to the use of the information about that

22

prescriber, but only with respect to the use of the

23

information in marketing to that prescriber.

24

narrowly drawn statute that enables the physician, not

25

the State, enables the physician to determine whether

What this statute does is put the

3

4

physician.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So he's required to

6

provide it, but he would be required to provide it quite

7

apart from the government regulation, right?

8

the pharmacy needs to know who to make the prescription

9

out to.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

I mean,

Well, it's because it's a

11

prescription drug.

12

13

not a prescription drug, a person can go into a drug

14

store and purchase a nonprescription drug just like any

15

other item in a drug store, not have to furnish the

16

name, not have to furnish any of this information.

17

the information is furnished because of the requirement

18

of a prescription which is of long standing.

19

Federal and State law require a

So

So this statute is really of a piece with a

21

protect -- protect privacy, for example, the Driver's

22

Privacy Protection Act, where a person is required to

23

furnish certain information in order to get a driver's

exploitation of that information.

That statute prohibits the commercial

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court, good morning:
You will want to have available you to the

19

red brief of IMS Health, Incorporated, which in its

20

appendix reproduces the statutes and findings.

21

reason we have to look at the statutes and findings in

22

this argument is because the case can't be decided as a

23

matter of absolutes.

24
25

And the

We know that statutes like HIPAA do protect
private information in third parties' hands and they are

governmental restriction on the use of information could

3

be used to distort the marketplace of ideas.

case is going to have to be decided somewhere in the

5

6

figure out where in the middle Vermont ended up.

7

On the other hand, we also know that a

So the

And in order to do that, we're going to have to

Now, in doing that I want to clarify I think

8

three things in the questioning of the first half hour.

9

They are about what the practice are -- practices are at

10

issue here; what this statute does, actually what's the

11

rule; and why is it that Vermont did it.

12

So as to Justice Ginsburg's question, are

13

there other sales, the State gave you the correct answer

14

that the pharmacy companies don't sell to researchers,

15

but that's somewhat misleading.

16

sell to the researchers, we sell to the government, the

17

intermediaries like IMS Health.

18

19

only sale is for pharmaceutical marketing.

20
21
22
23
24
25

That's because we're

So it is not correct to say that the

Second, on the important question of what
this statute -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I asked whether there are

sales to any other entities.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, and I said the State

gave you the accurate answer.

But the implication of

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the answer I think was not quite correct, because there

2

are sales for purposes other than for marketing.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if this was a general

4

sale provision, then that would include those sales that

5

you're talking about?

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It would not, because the

7

point would then -- and I'll come to the statute in a

8

minute, because all the exemptions -- right?

9

there's -- there's a debate that Justice Alito focused

So

10

on about what does the statute mean, and I do want to

11

turn to that in a second.

12

But to jump ahead to your question, Justice

13

Kagan, assume that it's a general sale prohibition.

14

Then there are all the exemptions and the exemptions

15

take all of these other uses out from the sale

16

prohibition:

17

government, and for clinical trials, for health care

18

research.

19

prohibition.

20

for academic research, to go to the

Those are all exempted from the general sale

So let's do turn, if you don't mind, to what

21

it is the statute actually does.

It is an important

22

point.

23

just want to read something.

24

I'm going to have been reading from page 42 of PhRMA's

25

Justice Alito quoted -- the statute only imposes

18

what they understood the statute to do.

Now, then the question becomes why did they

20

do it?

This was -- Justice Scalia, you tried really

21

hard to get them just to admit, let's just acknowledge

22

what the point is here.

23

that the purpose here is to limit the information

24

getting into the hands of the doctor.

25

rely on the State's lawyers.

And the State tries to deny

We don't have to

The State legislature was

35

2

So if we go to the appendix of the IMS brief

3

now, page 1a, okay.

4

their goal is -- this is finding number 1 at the bottom

5

of it -- containing health care costs.

6

Right at the top, the State says

Then in finding number 2 they explain why

7

they did it:

"There is a strong link between

"The goals of

And my favorite, obviously, is number 4:

14

"The marketplace for ideas on medicine safety, the State

15

determined, was operating in conflict with the goals of

16

the State."

17

They didn't like the marketplace of ideas.
Now, it is true, we acknowledge, that

another thing the State wanted to do was to give the

19

doctors some more control.

20

is an opt-out option.

that from happening?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Oh, I apologize.

We're

point.

was the debate that Justice Alito tried to point us to

18

about what the statute actually does and the Second

19

Circuit, what it understood the statute to mean.

20

should also say the cert petition didn't say that there

21

was a problem with that.

22

Remember, what the statute does is -- and this

Vermont picked out one thing.

And I

It said:

23

Look, when drug companies can find the doctors easily,

24

they can persuade the doctors to use more expensive

25

drugs.

We pay a lot for drugs.

We would prefer that

39

not happen, so we're going to make it harder.

2

State will have its counter-detailing program, it will

3

have its drug utilization review program, and insurers

4

will advocate for less expensive drugs.

5

uses are still permitted.

6

And the

All the other

If Vermont were serious about protecting the

7

doctors' privacy, as opposed to kind of a, a right of

8

publicity, a control over information about them, it

9

wouldn't have all these exemptions; it would have a

provision that says this is private information.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, suppose -­

12

suppose that the Federal Trade Commission after a 3-year

13

study of pharmaceutical manufacturing practices, decides

15

when drugs are sold to doctors it is very important that

upon who the doctor is and what his previous practices

were is irrelevant and harmful and false; and therefore

22

we find that it is a false and deceptive practice under

section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to use the

following prior practices of the doctor in selling him

14

Western States and your dissent in that case says these

15

are drugs, the compounded drugs that have not been

approved by the FDA, and I'm very concerned that you're

evading the FDA regulatory requirements about truthful

advertising.

And that is, you dissented in Thompson v.

drugs that all the messages that are being conveyed here

the debate to get out.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Sure.
And I suppose I don't know

15

the extent to which this does or does not promote

16

unbiased information from going to the doctors, and

17

isn't that a matter for the doctors themselves and the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Goldstein, I -- I

22

understand your argument and I have a difficulty.

Today

23

with the Internet and with computers, there's virtually

24

no privacy individuals have.

25

could be spread across the world instantaneously, and

Any transaction you do

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for the longest time catalogs would sell your name and

2

address to other catalogers, and if you bought one

3

product from one company, you would get a thousand

4

catalogs from 50 million others.

5

Today the industry is policing that, in part

6

to get the State not to intercede, by giving you an

7

opt-out option.

8

doesn't want a million catalogs, the industry is giving

9

you the right to opt out, so they don't sell your

10

And so, if you're a consumer who

address.

11

If there is, as I see, some interest that

12

the State legitimately has in protecting that part of

13

the public who says, I entered into this transaction, I

14

didn't really want you to sell my name, I didn't want

15

you to do other things with it, all I did was this

16

transaction, why can't the State say -- there is a

17

difference in my mind between an opt-in and opt-out?

18

Why can't the State say, your desire to enter a

19

transaction in which you're doing just that transaction

20

and not others is something we can protect?

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It can.

And let me explain

22

why it is that that rule -- and let me typify it for

23

you.

24

McCain-Kerry Consumer Protection Act and it does what

25

you're talking about.

There is a pending bill in the Congress called the

It says we're not just going to
46


Alderson Reporting Company

2

governmental rules.

3

Let me distinguish that bill from what goes

4

on under Act 80.

5

consumer and you engage in a transaction, you have the

6

right to opt out of any unauthorized uses, because it's

7

just between you and the business, right?

8
9

What that says is that if you are a

So there are three differences between that
and this.

The first is the structure of the statute.

10

That's not what this statute does.

11

every use of the information is just fine, except this

12

one, this one that allows one speaker who we don't

13

really like to go out and convey its message.

14

This statute says

The second difference is the public

15

importance of the speech involved.

16

information would be used for is to make some random

17

consumer pitch to you or about you.

18

about lifesaving medications where the detailer goes in

19

and talks about double blind scientific studies that are

20

responsible for the development of drugs that have

21

caused 40 percent of the increase in the lifespan of the

22

American public.

23

the public importance.

24
25

What that consumer

This is information

So there's a tremendous difference in

The third is the fundamentally different
nature of the privacy interest.

Unlike your consumer

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

transaction over the Internet, this is a doctor.

2

can call up any doctor's office and find out what their

3

prescribing practice is.

4

You

It's part of their business.

Imagine the following conversation, if you

5

will, and that is, and -- and if you want to look for a

6

place in the common law where this comes from, it would

7

be section 652D of the Restatement (Second) of Torts,

8

what things are private and what aren't.

9

whether a reasonable person would be outraged.

10

It asks

If one doctor were to say to another one,

11

you know what, Dr. Smith told people that three out of

12

four times I prescribe Aciphex for -- as a proton pump

13

inhibitor, would anybody be outraged about that?

14

But if you knew that the -- the company that you bought

15

from on the Internet was selling that information or if

16

they were giving away private medical information, you

17

would genuinely be outraged.

18

No.

So, Justice Sotomayor, the reason I started

19

this argument about it has to end up in the middle is we

20

know that statutes like that have to be constitutional.

21

At the same time, we know that the government can use

22

controls over information to really distort speech.

23

the question is, what happens in this statute?

24

statute has a structure that's not intended to protect

25

privacy.

It would look totally different.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I read in one of the

2

briefs that pharmacies were not permitting either

3

patients and/or doctors to opt out; that if a patient

4

came in and said I don't want my doctor's information

5

sold, or a doctor has called the pharmacy and said, I

6

don't want you to sell my information, the pharmacies

7

are not respecting those limitations.

8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why don't I read this

10

statute as simply doing what the consumer statutes are

11

doing, which is giving people some control outside of

12

the limited transaction that they're engaged in?

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Sure.

A couple of things.

14

Remember, the patients have nothing to do with this.

15

The State doesn't give any control to the patient.

16

would be true before or after.

I agree, Justice Ginsburg.

I read this as giving -- she said that they aren't

prescription information.

is no threat to the protection of private health

information, which is reasonably regarded as extremely

confidential.

15

point that my friend was making about the use of the

information by insurance companies.

9

Insurers are not

10

Insurers receive information directly from doctors and

11

parents in the ordinary course of their business and

12

they use it as part of providing and paying for care to

patients.

insurers do that with doctors' information as speaker

16

discrimination, I would like to point out that -- the -­

control that many of these statutes are structured in

such a way that there are expected and intended and

permissible uses of information, and other uses for

And I would like

Ms. Asay, I want to

22

give you the chance to respond to a point that was

23

highlighted by your friend, which is the fourth

24

legislative finding, which does seem to say that the

25

State is doing this because it doesn't like an imbalance
65

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the marketplace of ideas.

2

MS. ASAY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

3

The findings, first of all, have to be taken

4

as they were adopted, which was in support of not this

5

statute even as it was written, but as a much larger

6

bill that contained many sections, including a provision

7

that created the evidence based education program which

8

is a -- a clinical -- a -- a program to provide

9

voluntary education to doctors, and to the statute as it

10

used to be written, which -- which not only had this

11

provision for the doctors' choice and the use of the

12

information, but also mandated that pharmaceutical

13

detailers provide information affirmatively as part of

14

the marketing process.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do we have -- were

16

there -- were there findings with respect to the statute

17

as enacted?

18
19
20

MS. ASAY:

There are no findings that

accompany the amendment that resulted in this statute.
And to -- to return to, I think Justice

21

Kennedy's point from earlier, the statute, I think, has

22

to stand or fall on the restriction that it -- that it

23

allows for doctors.

24

discussed the fact that striking down a statute because

25

the court disagreed with the record would -- would

The Court, for example, in O'Brien

66

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

simply mean that the legislature could adopt the same

2

statute again on a different record.

3

We would say here that what -- what's -- the

4

question before the Court really is, may doctors have

5

this opportunity to control the use of their information

6

about -- their nonpublic information about their

7

prescribing practices as a marketing tool or not, and

8

that -- that -- that should be the -- the focus of the

9

Court's inquiry.

10

I would also like to just return to the

11

point that -- that I believe I was making earlier that

12

this statute is so different from the cases in which the

13

Court has considered restrictions on the direct

14

commercial advertising and the provision of information

15

to the public.

16

This is an entirely nonpublic commercial

17

transmission of data.

It -- it starts with a private

18

commercial transaction, it's a private commercial

19

exchange between the data vendors and the pharmacies.

20

It's used in a way that it is never disclosed publicly,

21

never included in the advertising message.

22

restriction here on the information that's provided to

23

doctors.

24

to be provided about prescription drugs.

25

restriction on any exchange between a willing listener

I believe my friend suggested that -- that

3

anyone could call a doctor's office and find out by

4

asking what the doctor prescribed.

Pharmaceutical

5

manufacturers can do that as well.

And if the doctor

6

volunteers that information, there can be that exchange

7

of information.

9

The statute does not restrict it.

I take it there's -­

there's -- it's against the law for a physician to say I

10

want you to fill this prescription in a particular

11

place, a particular pharmacy because I know that
