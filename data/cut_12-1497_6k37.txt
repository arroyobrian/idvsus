 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

United States, Ex Rel. Benjamin Carter.

 Mr. Elwood.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9

 MR. ELWOOD: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 By clearing the way for relator to file a 

12

fifth identical False Claims Act complaint against KBR, 

13

raising allegations the government had long known from 

14

other sources, the court below erred in two respects. 

15

 First, the plain text and  and history of 

16

the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act confirmed that 

17

it applies exclusively to crimes.  The language of the 

18

provision tolls limitations 

19

for offenses at the  on the very day that that 

20

provision went into effect. 

21

limitations periods 

 A neighboring provision, a nearby provision, 

22

of Title 18 divided offenses into two categories, 

23

felonies and misdemeanors, both plainly applying to 

24

crimes.  A neighboring provision, also of Title 18, 

25

divided offenses between capital offenses and noncapital

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offenses, again, referring solely to crimes.  And it  is 

2

very telling that in 857 dualcolumn pages of Title 18, 

3

neither the government nor relator has been able to 

4

identify any provision that uses the word "offense" to 

5

refer to a civil violation. 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is it unusual that a 

7

criminal statute of limitations would be much longer 

8

than a civil statute of limitations, which is the effect 

9

of your argument? 

10

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I don't think it is 

11

necessarily.  I mean, it depends on what exactly 

12

Congress is trying to attempt.  And it reflects some of 

13

the differences between how criminal law is prosecuted 

14

and civil law is prosecuted, because recall that 

15

Congress did  it has its separate provision for 

16

recognizing that the False Claims Act may be hard to 

17

investigate at times, and it provided a discovery 

18

mechanism there that doesn't apply to relators, it only 

19

applies to the government, a threeyear discovery period 

20

with a tenyear backstop. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Didn't some states used to 

22

have no statute for  for murder, and yet had a statute 

23

of limitations on wrongful death claims?  I think 

24

that's  that's the case, with respect to state law, 

25

anyway.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. ELWOOD: 

But I think it all kind of 

2

reflects the kind of differences between criminal law 

3

and civil law, because the minute a complaint is filed 

4

 I mean, most of the investigation, especially for 

5

relators  they don't have any legal status to conduct 

6

investigations.  They don't  they can't bring 

7

subpoenas.  So usually it's based on their own 

8

knowledge.  They file a complaint, they come into court, 

9

and then they have the Federal rules.  Also at that 

10

point, the government gets a 60day period to 

11

investigate, which is, on average, 13 months, according 

12

to the Chamber of Commerce brief.  It cites a letter 

13

from the DOJ to the Senate.  And in our own experience, 

14

and in this case, it is usually a couple of years. 

15

 And during that time they have, you know, 

16

all the time they want to investigate.  So I think it 

17

just reflects the fact that criminal litigation and 

18

civil litigation are conducted differently. 

19

 But clearly Congress already contemplated 

20

how to handle delays under the False Claims Act, and it 

21

enacted a civil provision for that under the FCA.  And 

22

so I don't think the Court needs to import in this 

23

general provision which applies only to offenses to 

24

address the False Claims Act situation that Congress has 

25

already specifically addressed.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Now, all parties agree that the Wartime 

2

Suspension Act began its life as a criminal provision, 

3

an exclusively and explicitly criminal provision.  The 

4

only question is whether Congress changed it along the 

5

way to make it civil. 

6

 The thing that the relators point to is the 

7

deletion in 1944 of the words "now indictable," but that 

8

went unremarked in Congress, and you would expect 

9

somebody to say something if they were fundamentally 

10

transforming the nature of the statute.  And that's not 

11

what people understood those words "now indictable" to 

12

mean at that time, if you look at  if you look at the 

13

other things that were around it at the time. 

14

 Like, for example, 47 days after the first 

15

Wartime Suspension Act was enacted, Congress  for 

16

crimes, and all agreed it was for crimes  they also 

17

enacted an antitrust suspension act which didn't use the 

18

word "offenses."  It used the word "violations."  And it 

19

said "now indictable" or "subject to civil proceedings," 

20

which shows that what was going on in that clause was 

21

about the "now."  The  it was to tell you that it 

22

applies to things that came before this.  And 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Were you adopting the 

argument of the New England Foundation, the amici brief? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

That is  yes, we made that

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argument, I think, in our brief as well, but I think that they did a 

2

more fullthroated version.  And also,  NDIA did a 

3

more fullthroated version of that.  But yes, I think 

4

that it was  the purpose of that was to say  it 

5

was applied to things before the date of enactment and 

6

hadn't yet been barred. 

7

 And that was one of the other things  I 

8

mean, if you look at what this Court said about that 

9

language in McElvain, it said that that was to  to say 

10

that the statute of limitations hadn't run, but that's 

11

what that "now indictable" language did.  This Court's 

12

McElvain 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Elwood, I take the 

14

point, and that seems like a fair understanding of why 

15

that term came out.  But it wasn't the only change that 

16

they made at that point.  And taking that term out may 

17

have had more than one reason, of course. 

18

 So two other changes they make are, they put 

19

in the word "any."  So the old statute just says 

20

"offense" and now it's "any offense," which suggests 

21

breadth and expansiveness.  And the other thing, of 

22

course, is that they do all of this in connection with 

23

this Contract Settlement Act, which presumably refers 

24

both to civil and to criminal matters.  And it follows 

25

right after this Contract Settlement Act and suggests

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that it's following on it. 
 So, you know, put all those three things 

3

together:  The taking out of the indictment language, 

4

the putting in the word "any," and the passage in 

5

conjunction with the Contract Settlement Act.  I think 

6

that that would be an argument on the other side. 

7

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Sure.  I'll try to address each 

8

of those.  I have a pretty terrible memory, so just 

9

bring me back to it if I forget. 

10

 I think "now indictable" is just to make it 

11

forwardfacing, because they were now not worrying about 

12

just those cases.  They wanted to make it 

13

forwardlooking for the rest of the war. 

14

 With respect to "any offenses," it wasn't 

15

just any offense simpliciter.  It was any offenses 

16

against the laws of the United States.  And Congress 

17

meant  thought that was so unequivocally applied to 

18

criminal law that that is the exact phrase they used in 

19

enacting the statute giving district courts exclusive 

20

jurisdiction over crimes.  They didn't say "crimes," 

21

they said "offenses against the laws of the 

22

United States" in 1948. 

23

 And what was the third point? 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Contract settlement. 
I told you I was a terrible

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

memory  pardon me? 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

3

 MR. ELWOOD: 

4
5

Contract settlement. 
Oh, and the Contract Settlement 

Act. 
 I mean, they say it was, you know, 

6

predominantly a civil statute, and it did create a big 

7

administrative state, or an administrative apparatus. 

8

But the provisions that they  the causes of action 

9

they created are actually  the primary ones it created 

10

were not actually subject to a statute of limitations, 

11

so it would have been curious to try to toll them. 

12

 For example, the thing  and this Court 

13

said in Kohler that 26(b)(1) of the  of the Surplus 

14

Property Act wasn't subject to any statute of 

15

limitations.  There was an analogous provision in that, 

16

19(c), which is the one that the relator and the 

17

government both pick out and say, aha, look at this, a 

18

new civil cause of action.  They were probably trying to 

19

toll that. 

20

 But as the Solicitor General said in 

21

footnote 3 of their Kohler brief to this Court, the 

22

remedy in that is substantially like the remedy in 20(b) 

23

 in 26(b)(1), with the suggestion being that it was 

24

not itself subject to a statute of limitations, which is 

25

what the district courts that have addressed 19(c) have

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said, that it wasn't subject to a statute of limitations 

2

as they 

3

applied a statute of limitations to both 26(b)(1), which 

4

this Court overruled, and to 19(c).  But I think that 

5

the district courts had a better  had the better of 

6

that argument. 

7

SG's brief points out, the court of claims 

 But the overall impression is it was still 

8

 at the end of the day, it was still applying to 

9

offenses, that is, crimes. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And that goes for the 

11

government as  I mean, suppose the government, not a 

12

relator, brings a False Claims case against a 

13

contractor.  The government wouldn't get the  the 

14

under your view, the government doesn't get the 

15

suspension? 

16

 MR. ELWOOD: 

That's right.  It doesn't get 

17

the wartime suspension.  It would, however, get the 

18

specific threeyear tolling provision, or threeyear 

19

discovery period, under the False Claims Act itself. 

20

 And a couple other notes that I think are 

21

worthwhile.  I mean, we've already said a lot about the 

22

fact that the Solicitor General said in 1959, at a time 

23

when it had been litigating these cases continuously, 

24

that it was subject to criminal laws only.  But I think 

25

it's also significant that the officer created by the

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Settlement Contract Act, or the Office of Contract 

2

Settlements, said in 1947 that this tolling provision 

3

only applied to crimes.  And I think that's significant 

4

because, I mean, it was within  I'm not saying it's a 

5

Chevron deference thing, but it was within their duty. 

6

As the government points out, they had to investigate 

7

and report it to the government to do what they will 

8

with it.  But the end result of it was that you have to 

9

know whether that's subject to tolling or not when 

10

you're deciding how to prioritize what you're going to 

11

be investigating and reporting. 

12

 I think one final thing, and then I'll move 

13

on to the other element, or the other error that the 

14

court made, was that neighboring provisions in Title 18 

15

simply wouldn't make sense if "offense" also applied to 

16

violations of the civil laws.  Like, for example, 

17

3282(a), it says, "No person may be tried for an offense 

18

unless indicted within five years of when the offense 

19

arose."  And, obviously, you can be tried for a civil crime 

20

without being indicted within five years.  And under 

21

Cowart v. Nichols that is, you know, something the Court 

22

takes into consideration in trying to determine the 

23

meaning of something. 

24
25

 Now, even though it would be mostly a 
complete remedy if we won on the wartime suspension

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

grounds, if the Court also gets to the firsttofile 

2

issue, it could save the 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

 MR. ELWOOD: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

6
7
8
9

And we in any way 
I'm sorry? 
Assuming we agree with 

you on the first question 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

Yeah, I'm assuming you agree 

with me on the first question. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 should we  should 

10

we get to the second?  And how would we if we believe 

11

if you were right on the first? 

12

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Well, you should, because among 

13

other things it will take care of, on remand the Court 

14

won't have to address the equitable tolling argument 

15

that we think is waived and also meritless. 

16

 And also, of course, there is the same issue 

17

already behind us in the Purdue Pharma case, and in the 

18

Shea case as well.  And so I think the Court may as well 

19

 I  it would be the most efficient thing to do.  But 

20

I think it will be  it  would be a complete remedy on us 

21

if we won on the wartime suspension grounds. 

22

 Now, the second error that the court below 

23

made was to  well, if Congress had meant the 

24

firsttofile bar to be a onecaseatatime rule 

25

allowing an  you know, an unending or  infinite

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

series of related lawsuits, they would have said so in 

2

plain terms. 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The only problem  the 

4

problem you have with this argument  and it's  has 

5

substantial force to it  but you give no significance 

6

of the word "pending."  You almost write that out of the 

7

statute. 

8
9

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I don't  I disagree, Justice 

Kennedy, because, I mean, you have to have some sort of 

10

word there, because otherwise it would be kind of 

11

confusing between the two  between the two actions. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

 MR. ELWOOD: 

14

Well, there are a lot of ways 



15
16

How about "former"? 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

"Pending" is a very strange 

word to pick. 

17

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Former, for a first  well, but the 

18

thing is  well, let me begin by saying that under 

19



20
21
22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Or "said action" or "that 

action." 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

Yeah.  But I think under each 

23

of the parties here, it could have been written better 

24

to follow up, you know, what  to embody the reading 

25

that we want to give it.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But I think that ours is the one that makes 

2

the most sense, because if you just look at the 

3

provision from the moment when the bar arises, it makes 

4

perfect sense.  It is the pending action at that point. 

5

And 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, aren't you going 

7

to  besides the problem that you're  you're talking 

8

, your're not giving "pending" any meaning, you're 

9

also destroying the force of an original source.  I 

10

mean, the  the public disclosure bar doesn't apply to 

11

an original source.  And you're sort of blocking 

12

original sources from bringing suits, when a prior case 

13

involved a dismissal for a technicality, or a dismissal 

14

because this was in the public domain.  But that's not 

15

true for an original source. 

16

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Right.  But I think  to begin 

17

with, there's nothing in the public disclosure bar that 

18

suggests that it was supposed to prevent the original 

19

source from being subject to all of the other bars that 

20

are out  are out there still, like the  you know, 

21

like the government knowledge bar that still exists in a 

22

tiny little corner, or the firsttofile bar. 

23

 And original source makes a lot of sense for 

24

public disclosure, but it doesn't make any sense for 

25

firsttofile for this reason:  When it's public

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

disclosure, when it's something that's said in a 

2

committee report, you have no idea whether or not it's 

3

gotten to  the ear of the person at the Justice Department 

4

who needs  needs to know about it, 

5

 for something to be done about it.  And firsttofile, however, 

6

 they not only  they have to file an action in 

7

district court, and they have to give all the material 

8

evidence they have to the Attorney General of the 

9

United States, who is under a statutory obligation to 

10

investigate it and who has to decide whether to 

11

intervene or not. 

12

 Now, that is something that guarantees that, 

13

you know, by hook or by crook, somebody at the Justice 

14

Department with responsibility for these things knows it 

15

and has the information that they need to take action on 

16

this.  And after you've done that once, it doesn't make 

17

a lot of sense for you to be able to just keep coming 

18

into court and filing a lawsuit telling the government, 

19

hey, you know that stuff that you already know?  Let me 

20

tell it to you again. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, the reality is you 

22

don't need the qui tam unless the government doesn't 

23

want to waste resources on something, but that doesn't 

24

mean that they didn't find that there might be something 

25

there.

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. ELWOOD: 

But once the  I mean, once 

2

the government has  once the original firsttofile 

3

bar  once the original relator reports this 

4

information to the government, if the other actions that 

5

are to be barred are related, the government has the 

6

information it needs to investigate all of them.  But 

7

what does 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But it may not want to 

prosecute it. 

10

 MR. ELWOOD: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It may decide there is 
You have to assume that 

12

what the intent is, is not to force the government to 

13

prosecute but to get recovery, for  for the 

14

government. 

15

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I think it is  the point of 

16

the firsttofile bar is to do two things  and this is 

17

kind of widely accepted  that first, it is to give 

18

incentives for people to come forward.  And I think that 

19

basically it's requiring it to stop at one is a much 

20

more powerful incentive to come forward promptly with 

21

the information you have.  And secondly, it is to make 

22

sure that the government doesn't dilute its recoveries 

23

by paying subsequent relators for information the 

24

government already has.  And if the first relator gave 

25

you enough information to investigate the whole breadth

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the crime, you won't have to pay that initial 

2

relator, you're  you know, depending on whether you're 

3

 I guess if you intervene by presumption it would be 

4

15 to 25 percent.  But if that person can file and the 

5

next person can file and the next person can file 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you have any idea how 

7

collateral estoppel works in this area?  I actually 

8

don't know.  But let's assume that you  that you're, 

9

that the adversary won a claim against you.  Could 

10

someone else come in and you've now won for the 

11

government, essentially, could anyone else file a suit 

12

or would they be stopped because 

13

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Well, at that point it would be 

14

already  I mean, I guess it would depend on the scope 

15

and how related.  You're talking about KBR loss in this 

16

hypothetical, correct? 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Exactly. 
Because they're the mutuality. 

19

I mean, it gives more  you know, because it had 

20

already been defined and the KBR had done certain 

21

things, that might apply to other relators.  But I think 

22

the thing that kind of matters more is what about the 

23

nonmutuality in the other direction?  Because if KBR 

24

beats relator number 1 and they say there was no problem 

25

here, what about relator 2 through X?

The relator is treated as 

Well 
And that was at least, at 

least sole judge after verdict. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

I don't  I don't think that 

it's clear that that's the case. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, there is  there 

is good authority, at least in the court of appeals, for 
that position. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

I disagree, Justice Ginsburg. 

12

We've  we've been looking for it and we have not found 

13

anything that clearly says relator 2 is bound by relator 

14

1 having lost in an action.  There is the  the  the 

15

language, which I think is dicta in Eisen  Eisenstein 

16

to say that the United States itself is barred. 

17

 But I think that any  well, any defendant 

18

is going to have to establish that law anew if it's 

19

going to apply to further relators down the road 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But is it your  your 

21

is it your position suit number 1 is filed, it's 

22

dismissed within weeks without prejudice,  no other 

23

relator can file? 

24

 MR. ELWOOD: 

25

It depends on what the basis of 

the dismissal was, because if it was dismissed on 9(b)

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

grounds, routinely they can amend.  And it's not 

2

dismissing the whole action.  It's just dismissing that 

3

complaint and they can come right back in with an 

4

amended complaint.  And that's the same action 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The question is whether 

6

somebody else could come in.  So you have somebody who 

7

is the first filer and comes in with a sloppy complaint 

8

and it's not stated with sufficient specificity; 

9

dismissed.  And that person goes  away.  You're saying 

10
11

nobody else can ever come in. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

No.  I think it's  the 

12

protection there comes from the word "related."  Because 

13

courts of appeals apply a same material facts test.  If 

14

you come in with a sloppy mess of a complaint that 

15

doesn't allege  it just says KBR is bad, it committed 

16

fraud 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What if it was a 

18

perfect  a perfect complaint, but he sued in the wrong 

19

court, or there was no personal jurisdiction? 

20

 MR. ELWOOD: 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

22
23

Well 
Dismissed without juris

 dismissed without prejudice. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

I mean, if it's  if it's in 

24

the wrong jurisdiction, you can transfer it.  I mean, 

25

that's a very hard thing to say because that nationwide

service 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No.  My hypothetical is 

3

dismissed without prejudice, but it's a beautifully 

4

drawn complaint. 

5

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Well, I'm going to resist 

6

I'm going to resist for a little while before we get to 

7

the  to the meat of the issue just to say that it's 

8

not going to happen because personal jurisdiction has 

9

nationwide service of process, and so it's very hard to 

10
11
12

invoke a personal 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
to prosecute. 

13

 MR. ELWOOD: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15
16

It's dismissed for failure 

Well, if it's 
For nonmerits ground, and 

so nobody else can come in? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

Well, if it's dismissed for 

17

failure to prosecute  well, first of all, let me 

18

resist the hypothetical a little bit more.  If it's 

19

under our rule, that's an incredibly valuable lawsuit 

20

because there are no more mulligans.  And so there'll be 

21

somebody who comes in there and is willing to 

22

underwrite, a new set of lawyers who will be willing to 

23

take the case. 

24
25

 But even if it is, I think that we would say 
it has been barred.  If somebody came forward and

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provided all material information, then everything that 

2

is related to that would be barred. 

3

 I'd like to get back to Justice Ginsburg's 

4

hypothetical because it's an important one, and that is 

5

if somebody files  the relator says, oh, well, 

6

somebody files a terrible complaint, it's going to bar 

7

all the good ones.  And I don't think that's the case 

8

because they're going to compare, under that test, the 

9

same material of facts test, you compare.  And if this 

10

one just says KBR is bad, they commit a lot of fraud, 

11

and this one says at these three camps they were 

12

requiring people to build 12 hours a day, 84 hours a 

13

week regardless of how much they  they worked, those 

14

aren't the same material facts and you get the 

15

protection that way. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought that first file 

17

rule was meant to protect the first filer in that 

18

well, one aspect of it is the first filer doesn't have 

19

to worry about a race to judgment.  Somebody else files 

20

second and gets the judgment first. 

21

 So I thought that that was  one of the 

22

chief things was to protect the first filer and also to 

23

protect that filer's recovery so he doesn't have to 

24

split up whatever the qui tam plaintiff gets. 

25

 MR. ELWOOD: 

The phrase "race to judgment"

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is not anything that I have found in the courts of 

2

appeals.  I've only found it in the government's brief. 

3

I think that the court says that they want to create 

4

the firsttofile bar was meant to create a race to the 

5

courthouse, not a race to judgment.  And 

6
7
8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The first filer is a race 

to the courthouse. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

Yes.  It's meant to create a 

race to the courthouse.  And there's less of an 

10

incentive to race to the courthouse under the relator's 

11

rule because even if you aren't the first to file, you 

12

can still bring a claim; you've just got to wait for a 

13

break in the traffic to jump in.  And under that, you 

14

if you are the first to file, you don't even get a 

15

better settlement because when, you know, most of these 

16

cases are settled, they aren't litigated to judgment. 

17

And a defendant is not going to give you, you know, 

18

everything you're asking for if they know that they're 

19

going to have to settle this case again and again and 

20

again.  And, in fact, it discourages settlements because 

21

you would be a fool to settle it right away because it 

22

just means more people are going to be able to sue you. 

23

 The relator's rule is as many lawsuits as 

24

you can fit into 6 years or 10 years or an infinite 

25

period of time because, you know, there  there's

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

nothing particular to stop them.  Whereas under our 

2

rule, you have much more of an incentive to settle and 

3

settle for the full amount, because by settling with 

4

that first relator, you are buying peace with respect to 

5

all related lawsuits. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Do we know in this 

7

case  there were three suits.  Thorpe, I think, was 

8

the first.  Do we know why those suits dropped out? 

9

 MR. ELWOOD: 

The first one was just 

10

dismissed.  The lawyers dropped out and they couldn't 

11

or they didn't find other lawyers. 

12
13
14
15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The first Carter, the 

first Carter suit. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

No, I'm sorry, the first Thorpe 

lawsuit 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

17

 MR. ELWOOD: 

The first Thorpe. 
 under the related lawsuits 

18

was just dropped for failure to prosecute when lawyer 

19

new lawyers didn't step in to take over for the old 

20

ones. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And you say that kills it 

for every  anybody else. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

Right.  Right.  That they made 

24

the full disclosure.  The government investigated that 

25

case and they knew the 12houraday, 84houraweek

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

claim, and they were able to investigate it and if they 

2

had wanted to bring it, they could have brought it and 

3

recovered the whole thing and only paid the Thorpe 

4

relators.  And I don't know why the other ones dropped 

5

out, but they were voluntarily dismissed, I believe, all 

6

of them. 

7

10

 And as I said, I think this is the more 
natural 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
by original sources? 

11

 MR. ELWOOD: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13
14

Were any of them filed 

Pardon me? 
Were any of them filed 

by original sources? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

I think  I think all of them 

15

were original sources.  They were all people who would 

16

have qualified as original sources and  under the 

17

under the statute. 

18

 And as I say, I think that this is a more 

19

reasonable reading of it, because if you look at this 

20

from the point of view of when the bar arises, when it 

21

is the pending action, it does everything, no word of 

22

surplusage.  Everything fits. 

23

 But I have yet to see a onecaseatatime 

24

rule that works the way that this statute does, that 

25

uses just an adjective, which, I mean, if you look at

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it, it's an adjective that is only describing what is a 

2

related case and usually 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But it's  it's not a 

4

pending action later.  I mean, when that action's been 

5

dismissed or been completed, you say that a later action 

6

is prohibited even though there is no pending action, 

7

right? 

8

 MR. ELWOOD: 

But that's  that's because I 

9

think that if you  as I say, if you look at this from 

10

the point of view of when the action is filed, it makes 

11

complete sense and it is a pending action.  And there's 

12

a reason for doing that.  If you'll look at pages 8A to 

13

9A, this is the mirror image.  The language used in 

14

(b)(5) is the mirror image of the language used to 

15

create the cause of action in (b)(1).  It says in 

16

(b)(1), a person may bring a civil action for violation 

17

of Section 3729, and then you find out what happens when 

18

they do that and the bar arises.  (5), when a person 

19

brings an action under this subsection for that 

20

violation of 3729, no person other than the government 

21

may bring a related action.  So it's a  it's a 

22

parallelism between a person may bring and no person may 

23

bring, which suggests that you look at it then going 

24

forward.  And looking  forward indefinitely, just 

25

says, (b)(1), you look forward for 6 years or 10 years,

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or if there's no statute of limitations, forever.  And 

2

by the same token, I think (5) is a lookingforward 

3

provision, that the bar arises and that's it, no person 

4

may bring. 

5

 And when you contrast that to saying that 

6

this is a temporal limitation, you know, I defy you to 

7

find another provision that uses just the word "pending" 

8

with no verb, no nothing, to give it some sort of effect 

9

like that.  You know, we cite a couple of  of 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Since you're getting into 

11

that event, I mean, to me, it makes perfect sense to apply it 

12

just to the pending action.  The action goes away. 

13

Number 2 person  and that means there isn't going to 

14

be the problem that Justice Ginsburg suggested, so we 

15

don't have that problem.  And now we have a new person 

16

who can bring a suit if and only if he is the original 

17

source.  Well, if he's the original source, let him 

18

recover.  Why not?  And your answer to that is, well, he 

19

didn't tell the government all this stuff, the first guy 

20

did. 

21

 Well, see, but that's not the only purpose 

22

of the qui tam action.  It has other purposes.  It's to 

23

reward the person who, in fact, did discover this thing 

24

and  and made every effort to bring it to public 

25

attention.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. STONE 
 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 
 MR. STONE: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 This civil FCA war fraud case is told under 
the plain language of the WSLA because it is an offense 

10

involving fraud against the United States under 

11

subsection 1 and is also an offense committed in 

12

connection with the payment or performance of a war 

13

contract under subsection 3. 

14

 If we look at  if we look at the text of 

15

the law which applies here, which is at our appendix at 

16

page 1, there is nothing in that text which limits 

17

which limits offenses to criminal offense.  There's not 

18

a single word in that text. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

20
21

But it's placed  placed 

in the Criminal Code.  It's placed in Title 18. 
 MR. STONE: 

That's true.  That's true, 

22

Justice Ginsburg.  But as the government has identified, 

23

I believe it's in Note 3 of their brief, there are at 

24

least seven civil offenses in the Criminal Code, 

25

including RICO, civil RICO.  And, in fact, I would  I

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would direct the Court to Section 1034, which says 

2

specifically, "The attorney general may bring a civil 

3

action in the appropriate United States District Court 

4

against any person who engages in conduct, constituting 

5

an offense under Section 1033 upon proof of such conduct 

6

by preponderance of the evidence." 

7

 That is a civil offense. 

That is not a 

8

criminal offense.  And I believe if you look, if  the 

9

Justices  if you look at 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

offense in Title 18? 

12

 MR. STONE:

I disagree, Your Honor.  I

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It wouldn't make any sense 

10

in Title 18 unless the offense they're referring to is 

11

one  one of the criminal offenses of Title 18. 

12
13
14
15
16

 MR. STONE: 

I don't agree, Justice Scalia, 

because 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Read the provision again, 

would you? 
 MR. STONE: 

Certainly.  "The attorney 

17

general may bring a civil action in the appropriate 

18

United States District Court against any person who 

19

engages in conduct constituting an offense under Section 

20

1033 and upon proof of such conduct by a preponderance 

21

22

 JUSTICE 

23
24
25

ALITO:  Yes.  But 1033 is a 

criminal provision. 
 MR. STONE: 

1033 is  the way a number of 

provisions in the criminal code are written, the

offenses or the conduct which is punishable are in 

2

             

3

 MR. STONE:

5

 subsection (a). 
I think  I think the 

point these people are trying to make, perhaps 

6

 MR. STONE: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
 is that that provision 

8

you've read provides for a civil action by the attorney 

9

general 

10

 MR. STONE: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
 against a person who has 

12

committed an offense.  What offense?  An offense 

13

elsewhere defined in 18.  Is that offense defined 

14

elsewhere criminal or civil?  It is criminal.

 MR. STONE:

 JUSTICE BREYER:

If we read the language 

carefully, which I have done 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I've got the language of 

that. 
 MR. STONE: 

If we read the language of a 

4

number of the statutes  a number of the statutes in 

5

Title 18, they have punishments that are criminal. 

6

Everything in Title 18 has punishments that are 

7

criminal.  There are a number of statutes within Title 

8

18 that also have civil remedies or create civil private 

9

rights of action.  Nobody believes by using the term 

10

"offense" that Congress intended to turn those into 

11

criminal statutes.  That is 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I  I agree with  the 

13

word "offense" appears and it provides for a civil 

14

action.  What I wonder is, when you turn to the 

15

particular provisions that do that, and look at the word 

16

"offense," is that word "offense" in those civil remedy 

17

provisions referring to a civil or criminal behavior? 

18

 MR. STONE: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20
21

It is referring to 
To civil you say.  So let's 

read 
 MR. STONE: 

It is referring to conduct which 

22

can constitute a crime which is punishable by criminal 

23

punishment, but is also punishable by civil  by civil 

24

remedies. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And the word "offense"

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

refers to the civil behavior. 

2

 MR. STONE: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4
5

Yes, because they're saying 
Okay.  Good.  Read me the 

example because I must have missed it. 
 MR. STONE: 

Because it says it must have 

6

proved by a preponderance of the evidence, which means 

7

it's not proved by, you know, beyond a reasonable doubt. 

8

So it can't be a crime.  It has to be a civil offense. 

9

And that language appears in a number of places in Title 

10
11

18.  But may I 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Stone, don't take this 

12

for more than it's worth because I think there are 

13

plenty of arguments against you, but I'm actually not 

14

sure I understand this one.  I mean, it seems to me if 

15

your view is it applies to both criminal and civil 

16

offenses 

17

 MR. STONE: 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

19

the thing someplace. 

20

 MR. STONE: 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right. 
 well, Congress had to put 

Exactly. 
It could have put it in the 

22

criminal code or it could have put it with all the other 

23

civil provisions 

24

 MR. STONE: 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And in fact 
Either way, there'd be kind

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of a mismatch.  And presumably, this started out as 

2

criminal and it refers largely to criminal, and so 

3

that's where it goes. 

4

 MR. STONE: 

Right.  And  and there's no 

5

dispute that there was a limitation in 1921 and in 1942 

6

on the statute because it said now indictable.  It said 

7

now indictable, so that referred to criminal. 

8
9

 Well, they took that limitation out, as I 
believe one of the Justices made the point earlier, not 

10

only did they take out that limitation, so there's no 

11

limitation on the word "offense," they added the word 

12

"any," which this Court has held in Gonzalez should be 

13

read broadly, any offense.  And this Court has said both 

14

in Moore, this Court said that an offense is  is an 

15

infraction of the law which may be punishable either 

16

civilly or criminally. 

17

 And, again, this Court said in National 

18

Gypsum that Congress knows the difference between the 

19

elements of a criminal offense and a civil offense.  So 

20

obviously 

21
22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What is your answer to the 

2

argument that this would be a big change if it 

3

previously applied only to crimes and then, according to 

4

you, it was changed so that it applied to civil claims 

5

as well.  That would be a big change.  What is your 

6

response to the argument that we might find a little 

7

a bit of evidence here or there that that's what was 

8

intended, but Mr. Elwood says there's nothing? 

9

 MR. STONE: 

There is much evidence, Justice 

10

Alito.  First of all, this was  historically, you have 

11

to look at when the statute was being passed.  In 1942, 

12

they were concerned about  they were in the middle of 

13

a war that was consuming the entire nation.  In 1944, 

14

they were concerned with wrapping up that war.  They 

15

were passing Contract Settlement Act, primarily a civil 

16

act.  This was passed, this amendment was passed as part 

17

of this Contract Settlements Act.  They were passing the 

18

Surplus Property Act.  How are we going to deal with all 

19

this property?  They created civil offenses for surplus 

20

property. 

21

 They did say, this same Congress, the 1944 

22

Congress said in a report that this will allow, because 

23

the bulk of the offenses under this Act will not be 

24

cognizable and investigated until after the war, this 

25

will allow for that  for the litigation to occur.  So

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they used the term "litigation," again, suggesting 

2

that's not a term you normally use when you're talking 

3

about crimes.  They used that term. 

4

 So  so they clearly

Is that your  that's your 

best evidence, that there was a reference to litigation? 
 MR. STONE: 

That's  that's the best 

reference because there's not  there's virtually 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Where  where did that 

appear? 
 MR. STONE: 

That appeared in a Senate report 

when they passed 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  That's all I needed 

to know. 
 MR. STONE: 

 when they passed the Surplus 

Property Act. 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 MR. STONE: 

But I  I think you need to 

19

look  you need to look at the historical reference of 

20

when this was occurring.  This was occurring when they 

21

were creating all these civil remedies.  It made sense 

22

for them to expand.  They added the word "any" to 

23

offense.  They had no need to add the word "any" to 

24

offense.  They did that because they wanted to make it 

25

clear that it could  it covered any offense, including

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

civil or criminal offenses.  And they took out  and I 

2

agree there could be more than one reason why you take 

3

this language out  but they took out the now 

4

indictable language, which was the only limitation that 

5

could be read in the text that would limit it to crimes. 

6

And there's nothing in the text as it now occurs. 

7

 I would also point out that the 2008 

8

Congress, when they strengthened this obviously 

9

believing that Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act 

10

should continue to be enforced, mentioned twice 

11

litigation, they mentioned the fact that  that this 

12

was in order to allow courts, prosecutors, and litigants 

13

to know when the statute

What Congress was that? 
The 2008 Congress. 
And that's  where does 

that appear? 
 MR. STONE: 

That appears in a Senate report 

as well. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Two  two Senate 

committees or just one Senate committee? 
 MR. STONE: 

One Senate committee report. 

It's cited in 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

 MR. STONE: 

And that's the Congress. 
Cited in our red brief, yes.

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Yes, Your Honor. 
 I would point out, though, that the meaning 

3

of "offense" in 1921 and the meaning of "offense" in 

4

1942 was a transgression of law as this Court said in 

5

Moore v. Illinois.  It's a transgression of law which 

6

could be punished civilly.  It could be punished 

7

criminally.  We need more context.  We need something in 

8

the statute to limit it.  There's nothing in the 

9

statute. 

10

 And it makes sense that Congress wouldn't 

11

have wanted to limit it because they would have wanted 

12

to give the government the option of pursuing a criminal 

13

remedy 

14
15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, all that's true 

except 

16

 MR. STONE: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 or a civil remedy. 
 except when you're 

18

dealing with an old statute that used to be clearly 

19

criminal, and it seems to me  at that point the 

20

burden  when that statute is expanded  the burden is 

21

on you to show that it's been changed from the criminal 

22

to the civil 

23
24
25

 MR. STONE: 

Well, Judge, I would point 

out 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 to include the civil.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And, you know, that's a different burden from what you 

2

expect. 

3

 MR. STONE: 

Justice Scalia, I would point 

4

out that nine of ten courts that considered this in the 

5

aftermath of the 1944 amendment held that it did apply 

6

civilly, and five of those were False Claims  Civil 

7

False Claims Act cases.  And those courts and that 

8

judicial precedent was in place  for  forty years, 

9

Congress never changed that language, never went back 

10

they could easily have written the word "criminal" in in 

11

1944, they chose not to do that.  And 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

 MR. STONE: 

14
15
16

 they could have written it in 


 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 MR. STONE: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20
21

Were they district courts? 

Four district courts?  Is that it? 

17

19

Well, were they 

They were district courts, yes. 
And did Congress know about 

those? 
 MR. STONE: 

Congress is presumed to know 

about them. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. STONE: 

Ah, ah. 
But I would also point out that 

24

the people in the courts that were operating at the time 

25

that this amendment was made understood it to change the

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

law.  Nine of the ten courts understood it to change the 

2

law.  So it goes to what people believed at the time the 

3

meaning of that word was.  Because 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

5

what?  They changed it to 

6

 MR. STONE: 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Changed the law to do 

To allow civil defenses 
 operating 

8

prospectively, not just to crimes that had already 

9

occurred? 

10

 MR. STONE: 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

12
13

Right. 
So that's one change that 

everybody agrees. 
 MR. STONE: 

Right.  Changed the law to 

14

include any offense, we would say, that was related to 

15

the war, which would include our civil FCA war fraud 

16

offense in this case.  It's specifically consistent with 

17

Congress' intent that  that a fraud such as occurred 

18

in this case, that the government would be able to 

19

pursue it.  It's a fraud on the troops in wartime.  It's 

20

exactly why this statute was passed and exactly why the 

21

False Claims Act was passed. 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

23

The government can pursue 

it in a criminal case.  The question is whether 

24

 MR. STONE: 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Right, and 
 the civil 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. STONE: 

And the question is whether it's 

2

appropriate and  and based on the language  Justice 

3

Scalia, based on the language of this statute, which 

4

nowhere in it contains a limitation  the only 

5

limitation was taken out in 1944, and instead they added 

6

the word "any" and they added two subsections that could 

7

be read 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

"offense"?  That's the limitation that is urged, which 
is normally used to connote a crime.

 MR. STONE:

 Well, the two

Who urges the word

And I don't think that

 MR. STONE:

But, Your Honor, in Moore v. 

19

Illinois, the Court said that "offense" means a 

20

transgression of law that could be punished either 

21

criminally or civilly.  And presumably Congress was 

22

aware of this Court's holding in Moore, or is presumed 

23

to be.  And then this Court again, on a number of 

24

occasions, including in National Gypsum, referred to 

25

Congress as being familiar with the difference between

41

Alderson Reporting Company

1

criminal and civil offenses.  There would be no need for 

2

the term "civil offense" or the term "criminal offense" 

3

if "offense" meant "crime." 

4

 "Offense" doesn't mean "crime." 

There would 

5

be no need for the word "criminal offense" if that's 

6

the 

7

The problem is that 
By the way, the word "criminal 

offense" occurs a number of times 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

11

 MR. STONE: 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Justice Ginsburg. 

I'm sorry. 
Everyone agrees that from 

13

1921 on, it was understood that this was a criminal 

14

statute and I think the point has been made before.  If 

15

Congress really was going to change it, to vote it all 

16

onto the excision of two words which can be explained on 

17

other grounds, it's a bit much.  Wouldn't Congress have 

18

said, now we're going to make it  we want it to be 

19

civil, so we're going to make it clear that it's civil? 

20
21
22

 MR. STONE: 

Justice Ginsburg, I  I would 

point out a couple of things about that. 
 First of all, the surplusage language 

23

which  which Petitioner points to which they claim was 

24

the reason that this was taken out, was in the statute 

25

since 1921.  So they have no historical reason why all

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of a sudden, in 1944, it was taken out.  It was there 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3

 MR. STONE: 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, there was a reason. 
 the entire time. 
The statute acted 

5

retrospectively for the first part of its history, and 

6

then they took it out when it was going to operate 

7

prospectively. 

8

 MR. STONE: 

But Judge  Judge Ginsburg, 

9

that's not correct, because the language at the end of 

10

the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act holds that 

11

provides that the statute does apply retrospectively. 

12

It applies to any statute of limitation which has not 

13

yet run.  And that's been in the statute since  since 

14

1942. 

15

 I would also point out that the 1921 statute 

16

had nothing to do with the war.  There's not much we can 

17

glean from the 1921 statute.  All that it did was to 

18

increase the statute of limitations from three years to 

19

six years for fraud.  It didn't mention the war at all. 

20

And in 1942, all that the statute did was extend until 

21

1945 the provision that was in in 1942.  It also did not 

22

refer to the wars.  The first statute that actually 

23

referred to the war was the 1944 statute. 

24
25

 So, yes, it's true that some language was 
used, but I believe, you know, as  as we set forth in

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

our  our brief, that "offense" can mean criminal or 

2

civil.  It's a textually permissible interpretation. 

3

There's nothing in  that limits it in the current law. 

4

It's consistent with  Congress intended when they 

5

passed these statutes.  And I urge the Court to 

6

seriously consider that, because it would be 

7

inappropriate for the government to be limited to 

8

pursuing cases only criminally against defendants who 

9

are war profiteers and not have that civil  civil 

10

remedy. 

11

 If I may move on to the False Claims Act 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

Well, you can either 

reserve time or move on.  It's up to you. 

14

 MR. STONE: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

16

 MR. STONE: 

I'd like to move on, if I may. 
Go ahead. 

The False Claims Act  as 

17

Justice Scalia pointed out, "pending" in the False 

18

Claims Act, it's a word that was chosen in the 

19

firsttofile provision.  It's a word that Congress 

20

chose to use.  It makes sense, because if you look at 

21

the statutory scheme in which that provision is found, 

22

it's talking about while that action is pending, what 

23

the government can do.  It talks about  the previous 

24

provisions talk about the government making a decision 

25

about intervening.  The next provision talks about the

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

government can dismiss that case, which  which 

2

protects all the concerns that  that Mr. Elwood has 

3

pointed out because the government has the ability to 

4

dismiss a case any time that it wants to if it isn't in 

5

the interest of the government for that case to be 

6

there. 

7

 So it also uses the term "intervention." 

8

You cannot intervene in a nonpending case.  Congress 

9

specifically chose to put these in the same sentence to 

10

say, no person shall intervene or file a related case 

11

while the  the case is pending. 

12

 So for that reason, I believe, "pending" is 

13

clearly the most reasonable interpretation, but it's 

14

also the most consistent with the statutory scheme, 

15

which as Justice Kagan pointed out, provides that 

16

original sources can go forward even if the government 

17

has knowledge of a fraud and even if the government is 

18

investigating that fraud as this Court found in Graham 

19

County. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What happens  what 

21

happens if you have a first filer who brings a claim, 

22

it's successful, either gets a judgment or gets a 

23

settlement, and the case is over?  It's no longer 

24

pending. 

25

 MR. STONE: 

We  we would argue, and I

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

believe the government will agree, that claim 

2

preclusion, res judicata, all the typical doctrines 

3

would apply.  I would point the Court to Stephens, where 

4

the Court held that the relator was an assignee of the 

5

government, and if an assignee of the government brings 

6

a case and either settles it or it's decided on the 

7

merits, that would bar any future case, and I believe 

8

the government will agree with that. 

9

 But to allow the defendants to say that a 

10

case that is brought that may never be pursued  like 

11

in this case, Thorp, where they alleged everywhere in 

12

the world there was fraudulent billing.  This person had 

13

never been to the base where the fraudulent billing was 

14

occurring in our case, had no personal knowledge of it. 

15

No relator, other relator, was found to be an original 

16

source.  They didn't reach that issue. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm not sure the government 

18

will agree with that, as you confidently predict, but I 

19

guess we'll ask the government.  But I think 

20
21
22

 MR. STONE: 

Right.  Well, that would be my 

 that would be our position. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think you're saying that 

23

if somebody brings a suit and is  and loses, the 

24

government is  is thereby precluded from joining a 

25

later suit.  Right?  The government is.

 and on the merits, there is a 

decision on the merits 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 the government has chosen not 

8

to intervene in that case.

Then they are bound. 
Then they are bound. 
Yes. 
Okay. 
And furthermore 
We'll see what the 

And furthermore, I just want 

21

I want to make the point that Congress, in the False 

22

Claims Act  I've been doing this for a while  that 

23

Congress inextricably intertwined the government and 

24

relators.  You can't tear them apart, because the whole 

25

point of the False Claims Act is to incentivize people

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with knowledge, with evidence, with witnesses, to come 

2

forward.  Because even if the government knows  and 

3

Congress understood this  even if the government has 

4

knowledge of the fraud, that doesn't mean they can prove 

5

the fraud.  That doesn't mean that they're going to be 

6

able to find out about the fraud by investigating it. 

7

What helps them prove the fraud is somebody who has 

8

personal knowledge, an original source who can testify, 

9

here's the evidence, I saw this happen.  And Congress 

10

knew that was very important, and that's why they 

11

created the original source provision and provided that 

12

original sources can pursue cases even if the government 

13

doesn't intervene.  Because there may be cases where the 

14

government doesn't intervene for various reasons where 

15

it's valuable for those cases, for the taxpayers and for 

16

the government, for those cases to be pursued.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 
 ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, 
 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 MR. STEWART: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 When Congress enacted the 1942 version of 

4

the Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act, it was acting 

5

against the backdrop of this Court's 1921 decision in 

6

United States v. Hutto.  And the Court in Hutto was 

7

construing the general Federal criminal conspiracy 

8

statute.  And that statute made it a crime, among other 

9

things, to conspire to commit an offense against the 

10

United States.  And the question before the Court was 

11

whether that criminal statute covered conspiracies to 

12

commit civil violations. 

13

 And the Court held that it did. 

The Court 

14

held that there was no necessity in the statute for the 

15

offense, the object of which is the conspiracy, to be a 

16

criminal offense, and that the criminal statute could be 

17

violated by a conspiracy to commit a civil wrong. 

18

 And there are certainly a great many 

19

provisions in Title 18 that use the word "offense" in 

20

which there are other contextual clues within the 

21

provision that make clear that only crimes are covered. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Is there  is there a 

23

provision that uses the word "offense" even though it 

24

may be civil, where that word "offense" in that 

25

provision refers to something other than a criminal

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

offense? 
 MR. STEWART: 

Not other than a criminal 

offense.  As Mr. Stone has 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Every use of the word 

5

"offense" in Title 18 is in reference to a criminal 

6

offense. 

7
8
9

 MR. STEWART: 

It refers to conduct with 

criminal  that  to which criminal penalties attach. 
 As Mr. Stone was explaining, there are 

10

provisions in Title 18 that use the word "offense" to 

11

describe conduct that is subject to both criminal and 

12

civil sanctions; and those are criminal offenses. 

13
14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But the answer to my 

question was yes? 

15

 MR. STEWART: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MR. STEWART: 

They are still crimes, yes. 
Yes. 
But what we would say about 

18

3287 is the word "offense" is being used something in 

19

the same way, as a hybrid.  There is no dispute that the 

20

current version of the WSLA does cover crimes.  It tolls 

21

the limitations period for criminal prosecutions, but it 

22

also applies to civil offenses. 

23

 That  the next thing I would ask the Court 

24

to look at is on page 1A of the government's brief. 

25

We've reproduced the original 1942 version of the

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act. 
 And the provision begins: 

"The running of 

3

any existing statute of limitations applicable to 

4

offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud 

5

the United States or any agency thereof, whether by a 

6

conspiracy or not, and in any manner, and now indictable 

7

under any existing statutes." 

8
9

 And if you look even to the rest of that 
provision, the only clear evidence you would find that 

10

this version of the statute was limited to crimes was 

11

the phrase "now indictable." 

12

 Now, it's possible that the phrase "now 

13

indictable" did other work as well; but it was the only 

14

language in the statute that limited the provision to 

15

crimes. 

16

 And so part  part of the questioning by 

17

the Court, understandably, has been to the effect of, if 

18

Congress meant to change this in 1944, why didn't it do 

19

something more direct to manifest that intent? 

20

 And part of our point is, in some sense, 

21

removal of "now indictable" is indirect, but in some 

22

sense removing the only language that previously limited 

23

the  the provision to crimes is the most way  direct 

24

way to go about it.  If the statute had originally 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, whoa, whoa.  You can

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say that it limited it or you can say that it  it 

2

showed  it showed that the word "offense" in that 

3

statute was being used to mean a criminal offense, 

4

right? 

5

 MR. STEWART:

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't think 
It could.  I acknowledge 

7

that sometimes you can say "offense" and it means civil, 

8

sometimes you can say that it means criminal, and 

9

sometimes you can say it means both. 

10

 But what that language did in the original 

11

statute was to make it clear that the word "offense" in 

12

this statute was being used in a criminal sense.  And I 

13

don't think that that implication is eliminated by 

14

simply taking out the  taking out the "now indictable" 

15

language, which could have been eliminated for a very 

16

different reason; and that is, to show that it  it 

17

operates prospectively. 

18

 MR. STEWART: 

I guess part of the point I 

19

would make is if the initial version of the statute had 

20

referred to existing  statutes of limitations on 

21

criminal offenses and Congress had then excised the word 

22

"criminal," we would say  I think that would be viewed 

23

as very powerful evidence that Congress intended an 

24

expansion. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But there would be no other

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reason for eliminating the word "criminal"; whereas, 

2

there is a very good other reason for eliminating the 

3

phrase "now indictable." 

4

 MR. STEWART: 

Well, the reason that has been 

5

postulated is that "now indictable" originally served 

6

the purpose of making clear that the WSLA would not 

7

revive expired prosecutions, and that this was no longer 

8

necessary in 1944 because the statute was amended to 

9

make that point clear separately. 

10

 But, in fact, the 1942 version of the 

11

statute said:  "This Act shall apply to acts, offenses, 

12

or transactions where the existing statute of 

13

limitations has not yet fully run, but..." it shall not 

14

apply to acts that would otherwise be  be barred. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

16

 MR. STEWART: 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18
19

Counsel. 

Yes. 
Is the Korean War 

covered by the WSLA? 
 MR. STEWART: 

I think the general 

20

understanding at that time was that only declared wars 

21

were covered; and so, likely, the Korean War would not 

22

have been covered.  I don't know the 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is that your  is 

24

that your position now, that only declared wars are 

25

covered?

53

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. STEWART: 

Well, the statute was amended 

2

in 2008; and it now provides  and the current version 

3

of the statute is at page 4A.  This is current 3287. 

4

 It says: 

"When the United States is at war 

5

or Congress has enacted a specific authorization for the 

6

use of the Armed Forces " 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

authorization in the Korean War? 

9
10
11

 MR. STEWART: 

Not  not pursuant to 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no.  I mean at 

the time. 

12

 MR. STEWART: 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

14

Was there such an 

Right. 
I don't think there 

was, right? 

15

 MR. STEWART: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I don't  I don't 
I'm trying to get at 

17

the question of the breadth of your position.  As I 

18

as I understand it, you're now saying "at war" doesn't 

19

necessarily have to have a declared war. 

20

 MR. STEWART: 

I think what we would say is 

21

at  up under the current version of the  the current 

22

wording of the statute implies that "at war" does 

23

require a declaration of war, but Congress has added an 

24

additional category when there has been a UMF pursuant 

25

to the War Powers Resolution.

54

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So if  so if the 

2

current version were effect  were in effect in 1950, 

3

the Korean War would not be covered, because there 

4

wasn't a declared war?  And my understanding is there 

5

wasn't a specific authorization for the use of forces. 

6

 MR. STEWART: 

That would be my understanding 

7

as well, that Congress seems to have acted to extend the 

8

statute beyond declared wars but not to anything that 

9

could be considered military operations if they have not 

10
11

been authorized in a particular manner. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Stewart, before your 

12

time runs out, what  what is the Government's position 

13

on the  on the point raised by counsel for Respondent; 

14

namely, if there is a dismissal of  on the merits of 

15

a  a civil action, is the government barred from later 

16

bringing a different action on the same claim? 

17

 MR. STEWART: 

Yes, we would think we would 

18

be barred.  We think that was Congress's expectation in 

19

1986 and that's the understanding of the statute that 

20

we've been operating under; that is, our protection 

21

under the statute is that when a qui tam suit is filed, 

22

we have an initial opportunity to decide whether to 

23

intervene or not.  Even if we initially decide not to 

24

intervene, we can move later to intervene for good cause 

25

shown and so if we initially think the relator can do a

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

capable job but then we decide later, no, he can't, our 

2

protection against the claim being badly litigated is 

3

that we can take over the suit, and if we don't avail 

4

ourselves of that protection and the case is decided 

5

against us on the merits, then claim preclusion would 

6

apply. 

7

 And I think in Taylor v. Sturgell, the Court 

8

identified a number of categories of cases in which 

9

nonparties can be barred in subsequent litigation.  One 

10

of them is when a litigant allows his claim to be 

11

litigated by a representative, and the Court in Stevens 

12

described qui tam suits as a species of representational 

13

standing. 

14

 And I think the same principle would apply 

15

to a suit brought by a second relator as well, that is 

16

an additional category of nonparty preclusion that the 

17

Court in Stevens  I'm sorry, that the Court in 

18

Taylor v. Sturgell identified was that when one party is 

19

barred from litigating himself, he can't relitigate the 

20

same claim through a proxy.  And if the United States 

21

would be barred by the judgment in the first qui tam 

22

suit from filing its own suit, then to allow a second 

23

relator to go forward on the same claim would, in 

24

essence, be allowing the United States to relitigate 

25

through a proxy.  And to us, it makes perfect sense that

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress drafted the firsttofile bar specifically with 

2

reference to pending actions because 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If the case is not  the 

4

first case is not dismissed on the merits, dismissed 

5

without prejudice and then relator 2 files, your 

6

position is that that suit may be maintained? 

7

 MR. STEWART: 

It would not be  our 

8

position is it would not be barred by the firsttofile 

9

provision. 

10

 Now, if  the Court may want to look at 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I'm curious to know, just 

12

because of background, would the first suit toll the 

13

statute of limitations as to the second relator? 

14

 MR. STEWART: 

I  probably  we believe 

15

probably not.  That is, I think typically the  the 

16

rule is that if the first suit is ultimately dismissed, 

17

then the second suit proceeds as though nothing had 

18

happened.  But that time wouldn't be tolled.  But the 

19

Court may look at page 5a of the brief, which reproduces 

20

the current version of the public disclosure bar, and it 

21

says, this is about halfway down the page:  "The court 

22

shall dismiss an action or claim under this section, 

23

unless opposed by the government, if substantially the 

24

same allegations or transactions as alleged in the 

25

action or claim were publicly disclosed in a Federal

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in which the 

2

Government or its agent is a party." 

3

 So often the effect of the 

4

first suit may be to bar second relators from suing 

5

under the public disclosure bar unless they qualify as 

6

original sources.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, Mr. 

Stewart. 
 Mr. Elwood, you have reserved 4 minutes. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

Mr. Stewart said that the only 

13

language in the provision in the Wartime Suspension of 

14

Limitations Act which limited it to criminal  limited 

15

it to crimes, was the phrase "now indictable, and I 

16

disagree with that.  If you look at the Antitrust 

17

Suspension Act that's reproduced in our brief, it said 

18

 what the Congress said there was "any violation." 

19

It's very telling that 47 days after enacting the 

20

Wartime Suspension of Limitations Act which used 

21

"offense" to apply only to crimes, it said "any 

22

violation which is now indictable or subject to a civil 

23

proceeding."  So it was the word "offense" there that 

24

was limiting it to crimes, not the word  not "now 

25

indictable."

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 In addition, I want to be perfectly clear 

2

about this, and at page 5 of our reply brief in note 3, 

3

we go through all of the claimed criminal code 

4

provisions which supposedly used the word "offense" to 

5

mean a civil violation and they do not.  Every time the 

6

word "offense" appears, it is to describe the crime in 

7

the statute, not something else.  They may say the 

8

conduct underlying the offense or something like that, 

9

but every time they use the word "offense," it is to 

10
11

refer to a crime and nothing else. 
 Mr. Stewart also mentioned this  the Hutto 

12

case, and to decide it against the backdrop of Hutto.  I 

13

want to point out that that  the crime at issue in 

14

Hutto is the last criminal code provision which they 

15

have identified which used the word "offense" they say 

16

to include a civil violation.  And the Government there 

17

said that that was taken care of, it's now no longer 

18

a  no longer applies to civil violations because 

19

Congress amended it, 371, the conspiracy statute, to say 

20

that a minor offense is a misdemeanor. 

21

 Well, that has exactly the same effect of 

22

the statute that I talked about earlier that was in 

23

force the day this provision of the Wartime Suspension 

24

Act was enacted.  It says that offenses are either 

25

felonies or misdemeanors.  Nobody has said a word about

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that yet. 

2

 And it has exactly the same provision as the 

3

amendment that Mr. Stewart says overruled Hutto.  Also, 

4

I think Hutto has to be viewed in light of the case it 

5

cited, a fivepage opinion that relied heavily on the 

6

1893 case of Pettibone, which has said there can be 

7

conspiracies to violate the civilian laws.  So I think 

8

Hutto is a conspiracy case and nothing more. 

9

 Oh, and with respect to the  the res 

10

judicata, I want to point out that at this point, still 

11

no one has cited a case in which relator two is bound by 

12

the loss of relator one.  Taylor v. Sturgill talks about 

13

representative litigation, and I think that that maybe 

14

works in one direction, and that the government can be 

15

bound by relator one's loss.  But it's hard to say that 

16

relator one  I mean, at least, I will be more than 

17

happy to argue this position, but I can expect there 

18

will be some pushback, probably including from the 

19

Government at that time, if I say that relator two was 

20

the representative of relator one when relator two was a 

21

stranger to relator one. 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Relator two is treated as 

the Government for this purpose. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

But in any event, no one has 

yet cited to me a case where this has already been

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

determined, so it's all litigation risk to my client 

2

now.  And Finally, I want to point out one final thing, 

3

which is that Mr. Stewart said that  a undeclared war 

4

under the preamendment Wartime Suspension Act did not 

5

apply to undeclared wars.  The Fourth Circuit said 

6

differently, and the Government has now confessed error, 

7

or at least they said that the Fourth Circuit erred in 

8

that position.  I just wanted to bring that to the 

9

Court's attention, even though it is at most a tertiary 

10

issue before this Court. 

11
12

 And if there are no further questions, we'll 
rely on our submission. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

14

 The case is submitted.
