 Mr. Martinez.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ 

8

10
11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Three features of the FTCA's text and 

12

history make clear that Congress did not want to allow 

13

equitable tolling of its time bar.  First, Congress 

14

drafted that bar in 1946 using jurisdictional language 

15

transplanted from the parallel Tucker Act context. 

16

 Second 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

18
19

Is the  is the word 

"jurisdiction" used? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

The word "jurisdiction" was 

20

not used in  in that language, Your Honor, but 

21

the Court had interpreted that language in the Tucker 

22

Act context in six cases beginning with the 

23

the Court's decision in Kendall in 1883.  And that 

24

decision  those line of cases had made very clear not 

25

only that the time bar was jurisdictional, but 

Alderson Reporting Company

4
1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's the Court. 

2

Congress did not say jurisdiction.  And I  I'm sure 

3

you are well aware that this Court, for some time now, 

4

has been explaining that "jurisdiction" is a word of 

5

many meanings, too many meanings, and has tried to 

6

distinguish jurisdiction, meaning subject matter or 

7

personal, from the rules, once a case fits jurisdiction, 

8

how it will be processed in the Court.  And it seems to 

9

me a time limitation, even a very stringent time 

10
11

limitation, is not jurisdictional. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, I think two 

12

points on that.  First of all, I think that when 

13

Congress acted in 1946 and it transplanted the  the 

14

identical words of the statute that  of the Tucker 

15

Act  the statute governing Tucker Act claims, Congress 

16

understood itself to be incorporating the same settled 

17

meaning, and those words had already been given a 

18

jurisdictional meaning by this Court. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Jurisdictional in the 

narrow sense. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

In  in the sense that 

22

that  that if  that it went to the Court's ability 

23

to hear the case 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Yes, that's what I 
 and the jurisdictional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

consequences were attached to those  to those words. 

2

In other words, the  the issue had  could not be 

3

waived by the government, and no equitable tolling was 

4

available. 

5

 In this Court's more recent cases, I think 

6

the ones that, Justice Ginsburg, you were referring to, 

7

in the Henderson case, what this Court said was that 

8

was that the Court will presume that a provision is 

9

jurisdictional when a long line of this Court's cases, 

10

undisturbed by Congress, has treated a similar provision 

11

as jurisdictional. 

12

 And in this case, we have a statute that had 

13

been interpreted by a long line of this Court's 

14

decisions, all in the Tucker Act context, very similar 

15

or identical 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But not the Tort Claims 

17

Act.  The Tucker Act, I think the  the line that 

18

the Court drew, it said if we characterize these as 

19

jurisdictional in a prior case, we will stick with that. 

20

But in the future, we're not doing that anymore. 

21

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

But I think what the Court 

22

has said, both in the cases addressing jurisdiction and 

23

in the cases  in the Irwin line of cases addressing 

24

the available of  the availability of equitable 

25

tolling is that the Court is not going to look for magic

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

words in the statute.  It's going to look to the text, 

2

the context, and the relevant historical treatment, and 

3

that the overarching purpose of the inquiry is going to 

4

be to find out what Congress understood itself to be 

5

doing at the time that it enacted the statute. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Martinez, wouldn't 

7

that argument suggest that Irwin was really only good as 

8

to new statutes?  As to statutes that were passed after 

9

Irwin? 

10

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I don't think so, Your Honor. 

11

I think  I think what the Court did in Irwin, it 

12

didn't conduct a lengthy historical analysis of all 

13

statutes that had ever been passed.  But what it did was 

14

it  it based its  its conclusion and  and the 

15

presumption on a kind of logical inference.  The Court 

16

essentially reasoned, as I understood the decision, as 

17

follows:  The Court said that  that when  we think 

18

in the mine run of cases when Congress wants to take the 

19

big step of waiving sovereign immunity, it's  it's 

20

reasonable to think that Congress also likely wanted to 

21

take the small step of allowing equitable tolling. 

22

 And that  and that may well have been true 

23

in 1990, when Irwin was announced.  It may have even 

24

been true in 1972, when the statute that was addressed 

25

in Irwin was announced.  But we know for certain, and I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

think the parties agree on this, that the rule in 1946, 

2

when the FTCA was passed, was something quite different, 

3

and the Court addressed that in the Soriano case just a 

4

few years later in 1957. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What was different about 

6

1972?  They were preIrwin.  So why wouldn't 19  a 

7

1972 statute, the extension of Title VII to federal 

8

employees, why wouldn't that fall under the old regime 

9

instead of the fresh look that Irwin took of it in 1990 

10
11

as applied to a 1972 statute? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Well, I think the  the key 

12

thing  the  the issue in this case is, obviously, 

13

the FT  is, of course, the FTCA.  And I think there 

14

are significant distinctions between the FTCA, which was 

15

passed in 1946, and the provision that was passed in 

16

1972 that was addressed in  in Irwin.  And we have 

17

statutespecific evidence, it's very detailed and is 

18

much  much more extensive than the evidence that was 

19

before the Court  or that was available in  with 

20

respect to Title VII. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, you see, I would  I 

22

guess I would have thought that really anything 

23

preIrwin, the government could stand up and make a 

24

very, very similar argument, which is, you know, in this 

25

world we actually thought that a statute of limitations

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

with respect to a suit against a government was 

2

jurisdictional, did not include equitable tolling, that 

3

there were really no decisions the other way, that 

4

Congress thought of that as the background rule.  And so 

5

what's to prevent this case from essentially becoming 

6

everything prior to 1990 is presumed to be 

7

jurisdictional contra Irwin? 

8
9
10
11

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Well, we're not asking for 

that presumption, and we don't think that the Court 
needs to apply that presumption. 
 I think what the Court needs to do is to 

12

look at the language of Irwin, which says that there's a 

13

presumption.  It's based on its kind of logical 

14

inference about the mine run of cases.  But it also says 

15

that the presumption is rebuttable.  And it's rebuttable 

16

based on statutespecific evidence where the government 

17

can come forward and overcome the presumption by showing 

18

that, with respect to a particular law, Congress had a 

19

different intent in mind. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So if there's ambiguity, 

21

what breaks the tie?  You've made your argument, but 

22

there are some counters.  The two most important are 

23

that Congress took this provision out of the 

24

jurisdictional section, and put it in  in a different 

25

section, number one; and, number two, it said treat the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

government like you would treat any other party. 

2

 So those two counter. 

3

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5
6

With res 
What  how  how do we 

break the tie? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Well, I think if there were 

7

in fact a tie, I think the  Irwin does  does put 

8

essentially the slight thumb on the scale in favor of no 

9

equitable tolling.  But I don't think that there's a tie 

10

in this case for a number of reasons.  Let me just 

11

address  I think the primary reason is the Tucker Act 

12

point which I mentioned.  But let me address the two 

13

textual points that you raised, Your Honor. 

14

 The first argument about the placement of 

15

the provisions, as the Court knows, the provisions were 

16

separated in 1948 as part of that recodification.  And 

17

in the recodification law itself, in Section 33 of the 

18

recodification law, Congress expressly forbade any 

19

inference of legislative construction of what the 

20

statutes meant based on the chapter of U.S. Code of 

21

Title 28 in which it was placed.  And so the argument 

22

that my friend makes that the placement of the 

23

provisions in different chapters, that's  that's an 

24

argument that  that Congress expressly took off the 

25

table.

Alderson Reporting Company

10

3

5

 With respect to the second textual 
argument 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That was in the text of the 

recodification? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Yes.  That was in  in 

6

Section 33 of the 1948 recodification.  And not only 

7

that, Your Honor, but  but I think this Court 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Does legislative history 

support that, too? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

It does.  The legislative 

11

history supports  supports it.  It's not just the 

12

texture, Justice Scalia. 

13

 The  with respect to the second argument, 

14

Justice Sotomayor, that you raised, I think it's true 

15

that there's language in  elsewhere in the FTCA in 

16

Section 2674 about the idea that  that the FTCA 

17

intended to create liability where a private person 

18

in circumstances where a private person would be liable 

19

under State law.  But what this Court recognized in 

20

Richards and what  what a lot of courts have 

21

recognized, including Judge Friendly's opinion for the 

22

Second Circuit in the Kosak case is that the time bar 

23

provision, 2401, is an exception to that principle and 

24

is essentially a circumstance in which Congress 

25

specifically indicated that it didn't want the same rule

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

to apply as would apply between private parties in 

2

under State law. 

3

 And so we don't think that those textual 

4

arguments get a lot of traction here and they certainly 

5

don't overcome the strongest textual argument which is 

6

on our side, which is, of course, the express and 

7

deliberate incorporation of the Tucker Act language that 

8

it applied to Tucker Act suits in the court of claims. 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Tucker Act doesn't have 

10

to the same extent, in the same manner and to the same 

11

extent as with respect to a private party.  That's new 

12

in the Tort Claims Act. 

13

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

It  it's true that the 

14

Tucker Act doesn't have that language.  I don't think it 

15

needed that language because the Tucker Act 

16

essentially, that language in the Tort Claims Act, I 

17

think, is intended to point to the substantive  the 

18

law that's supposed to be applied, as this Court 

19

recognized in Richards.  And so it says, you know, look 

20

to State law when you're applying the tort law. 

21

 The Tucker Act is a little different because 

22

there you're applying Federal law.  You're applying 

23

Federal constitutional law, Federal statutory law or the 

24

Federal common law of contracts in the Tucker Act 

25

context.  So it didn't need that language.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

 But what the Court has recognized in its 

2

cases is, again, that that principle of  sort of the 

3

parity principle, you know, treat the government like a 

4

private party, that  that 2401(b) is really an 

5

exception to that principle. 

6
7
8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I take it that your argument 

would apply not only to 2401(b), but also to 2401(a)? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

We  the government's 

position is that 2401(a) is  is also jurisdictional, 

10

not subject to tolling.  But our argument is really that 

11

the Irwin inquiry requires a statutespecific inquiry. 

12

And so 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But it's the same language. 

14

And if I understood the argument you're  you're 

15

making, it's  your essential argument is this 

16

incorporated the Tucker language, Congress knew what the 

17

Tucker language meant, therefore, Congress understood 

18

these to be jurisdictional as well. 

19

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, I don't want to 

20

resist your  your point too much, but I do want to 

21

point thought that 2401(a)'s history is slightly 

22

different.  The language in 2401(a) actually originates 

23

in the Tucker Act itself in 1887.  The language from 

24

2501 actually came from the 1863 statute, and that's the 

25

language, the actual  you know, the 12word phrase

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

that's repeated in 2401(b) comes from that provision. 

2

So there's some slight differences, but we're not going 

3

to fight.  We certainly would agree that the  that the 

4

2401(a) language is  is jurisdictional and that's 

5

being litigated in the lower courts. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I meant, I have to think 

7

that this is just all over the U.S. Code, this kind of 

8

language.  There's nothing unusual about this language 

9

"shall be barred."  This is kind of the classic 

10
11

language, right? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think that the "shall be 

12

barred" or "forever barred," that language does appear 

13

in a couple of places.  But I think what  what's 

14

important for purposes of our argument is not just that 

15

twoword phrase, but the broader phrase, because the 

16

broader phrase is what shows that when  when the human 

17

being who sat down on behalf of Congress to actually 

18

write this statute, it shows, I think, that he was 

19

basing it  he was essentially cut and pasting from the 

20

preexisting Tucker Act provision.  And so that language 

21

that's relevant is not just "forever barred," but the 

22

phrase "every claim against the United States cognizable 

23

shall be forever barred unless."  And I think that it's 

24

very  it's not just the language itself, although the 

25

language is identical, but it's clear that Congress,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

when it was drafting the FTCA, was  its goal was to 

2

fill a gap that had been left open in the Tucker Act. 

3

The Tucker Act itself said that it would apply to 

4

certain claims, quote, "not sounding in tort," unquote. 

5

And the legislative history that  that we've cited in 

6

our briefs discussing the purposes of the FTCA makes 

7

clear that Congress was looking at the  the Tucker 

8

Act, they saw that there was this hole for tort claims, 

9

they wanted to plug that gap, and they wanted to give 

10

tort claimants, in the language of the  of the 

11

relevant committee reports, the same right to a day in 

12

court that claimants had under the Tucker Act. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It sounds to me like, the 

14

way you're going about this inquiry, we're going to have 

15

to take a case on every statute of limitations in  in 

16

the U.S. Code.  Because you're saying, well, this is 

17

similar enough and maybe this would be a little bit 

18

different, it has a few fewer words, and then we have to 

19

look at the history, and we have to stare at the 

20

drafting concerns of Congress.  And I thought that Irwin 

21

was supposed to take us away from all that. 

22

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I  I don't think that  I 

23

don't think it's correct that you would have to take a 

24

case on every statute of limitations, Your Honor.  I 

25

think that  that in those cases where the government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

can come forward with strong statutespecific arguments, 

2

that the statute was  was lifted, for example, from 

3

the Tucker Act or from other similar statutes that had 

4

been repeatedly interpreted as jurisdictional, I don't 

5

think there's going to be much question about whether 

6

tolling is allowed. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

presumption, right? 

9

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Irwin said this was just a 

And that's exact 
And it said the presumption 

11

could be overcome and it made clear that this is a 

12

question of what was the congressional intent.  When you 

13

put all those three together, of course, you have to 

14

look at each statute separately, don't you? 

15

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

We  I couldn't agree more, 

16

Justice Scalia.  And I think that's  that's actually 

17

consistent with this Court's practice.  After Irwin, 

18

the Court has repeatedly looked at  at different 

19

Federal statutes and it's conducted exactly the kind of 

20

statutespecific inquiry into the text, the history, the 

21

precedent, trying to figure out what Congress was 

22

thinking. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if you have looked at 

24

the  the statutes that could be interpreted one way or 

25

the other, are there any that you have concluded are not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

jurisdictional other than those that we have already 

2

held are not jurisdictional? 

3

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, I confess that I 

4

haven't gone through the  the code with an effort to 

5

try to figure out where ones that are not 

6

jurisdictional.  I think the ones that I have looked at 

7

are the ones that the Court has addressed, most 

8

significantly in the Brokamp case, in Beggerly, in 

9

Auburn Regional, in John R. Sand & Gravel, and now in 

10

in this case.  And I think what  what those precedents 

11

show is that what the Court has done with Irwin is not 

12

to treat it as a conclusive presumption, but, rather, to 

13

treat it as a rebuttable presumption 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Sure.  But there are two 

15

kinds of ways that you can rebut something.  One is by 

16

saying, here's something very distinctive about this 

17

statute that shows that Congress meant for it to be 

18

jurisdictional, that shows that Congress didn't mean for 

19

equitable tolling to apply.  But that's not the kind of 

20

argument you are making here.  You're making an argument 

21

that basically says in this preIrwin world, Congress 

22

understood that when it came to statutes against the 

23

government, they would be jurisdictional and equitable 

24

tolling would not apply, see the Tucker Act.  And that 

25

could be said, I think, for every statute with respect

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1
2

to suits against the government prior to Irwin. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

With respect, Justice Kagan, 

3

that's  that's not our argument.  Our argument is 

4

specific to the FTCA and there I think  I don't want 

5

to give you more than three, the golden rule of three, 

6

but there are five distinctions.  I can just tick them 

7

off. 

8

 One is the incorporation of the express 

9

language of the Tucker Act.  Two is the fact that this 

10

Court addressed this  this particular statute, or at 

11

least tort claims, in the Soriano decision.  It also 

12

addressed this particular provision 2401(b) in Kontrick. 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought Soriano was 

was a Tucker Act case. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

It did, Your Honor, but 

16

but the Court expressly addressed  it said that 

17

essentially, that the same rule that would apply in 

18

Tucker Act cases would also apply to  to statutes 

19

waiving sovereign immunity for tort actions.  And that 

20

was a response to the point that we had made in our 

21

brief 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if the sovereign 

23

immunity is what drives it, then the presumption would 

24

be overcome in every case against the government because 

25

government 

Alderson Reporting Company

18
1

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think  I think at a 

2

minimum, it would  I think what we have in this 

3

statute that was not present in Irwin is the fact that 

4

this Court had expressly mentioned, you know, tort 

5

actions; and then not only did the Court mention it, but 

6

then Congress reenacted the statute in 1966, not just 

7

against the backdrop of this Court's statement in 

8

Soriano, but also against the backdrop of the uniform 

9

view of the lower courts, including a number of courts 

10

of appeals, that it all said that this statute was 

11

jurisdictional, not subject to waiver, not subject to 

12

tolling.  And so that's another unique feature of this 

13

statute, the 1966 reenactment. 

14

 We also have a number of private laws, ten 

15

reallife statutes that were passed by Congress that 

16

seem to refer explicitly to 2401(b) as having  as 

17

being a jurisdictional statute.  That's very different 

18

from Irwin and it's very different from a lot of almost 

19

 I would imagine almost any other statute of 

20

limitations in the U.S. Code. 

21

 And then finally, we have the fact that 

22

Congress for 60 years, from the '20s through the 1980s, 

23

repeatedly grappled with the very question that's at 

24

issue in this case, which is whether equitable tolling 

25

should be permitted under the FTCA.  In the  in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

bills that it  that it considered before 1946, a 

2

number of those bills, 9 of the 31 that had been 

3

proposed, had various types of tolling provisions. 

4

Those were left out of the final statute.  Since 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Is there another  is 

6

there another reason  I think both briefs are good 

7

briefs and you each have good arguments.  And so if it's 

8

an open question, why does the government oppose this? 

9

That is to say, compared to contracts, people who are 

10

suing on contracts usually have a lawyer and they have 

11

had lawyers, they're dealing with the government, not 

12

all.  But this is about torts.  And people who are hurt 

13

with torts are frequently badly hurt, they could be 

14

anyone in the world.  The government could have treated 

15

them very badly.  Lots of things can happen. 

16

Hurricanes.  The lawyer gets deathly ill on the way to 

17

the courthouse.  The clerk mixes up the papers. 

18

Somebody steals the lawyer's briefs and runs off to 

19

Chicago. 

20

 I mean, all kinds of odd things can happen 

21

to a victim of a tort caused by the United States.  Now, 

22

if in fact you throw them out on this thing, which I 

23

would call a technicality, he has to go to the Senate 

24

and he has to ask them for a private bill, which is a 

25

drain on their time and somewhat random.  So those are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1
2

the real choices. 
 Now, why other than, well, we read it and 

3

that's what the law is  I got that part and that is 

4

not a bad argument on your part.  But is there anything 

5

else?  Is there any sort of functional reason why the 

6

government doesn't just say, look, where this person's 

7

been hurt and can win his court, fine, we won't throw 

8

him out on the basis of this.  If the hurricane happens, 

9

et cetera, then let's proceed anyway. 

10

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, as  as you 

11

suggested, our primary argument here is that  that we 

12

should win because the law is on our side. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That there's nothing else? 

14

That's a good reason by the way.  That's a good reason, 

15

yes. 

16

 (Laughter.) 

17

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

18

In addition to the law being 

on our side 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Yes. 
 let me try to give a 

21

little bit of context for why  why Congress and why 

22

the United States Department of Justice and the 

23

Executive Branch has consistently opposed equitable 

24

tolling in these circumstances.  And this was heavily 

25

debated before 1946 and it's been heavily debated since.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

And at every turn, what  what the position of the 

2

Executive Branch and of Congress, the conclusion that 

3

they've come to, is that this is such  this was such a 

4

revolutionary step for  for Congress to take in 1946, 

5

to create the tort remedy in the first place.  And this 

6

was the second great waiver of sovereign immunity.  It 

7

in some ways, you know, reconceptualized the  the 

8

relationship between the government to the people, 

9

but  and that was a great step.  But they were very 

10

cautious.  They were very careful and they  they 

11

expressly treated the statute of limitations provision 

12

as a safeguard to protect the government from claims 

13

that could be brought years afterwards.  And so they 

14

wanted something that was strict and this was going to 

15

 the purpose of the limitations provision was going to 

16

be to preserve evidence, and also to  there was 

17

another consideration, which was the fact that this was 

18

a very controversial bill.  It took 20 years for it to 

19

get through in the 20th century 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But, Mr. Martinez, what 

21

you said, it's as though the choice were statute of 

22

limitations or nothing.  To get equitable tolling, it's 

23

a pretty tough case.  In order to get equitable tolling, 

24

you must have a truly exceptional case, maybe the case 

25

that we're now  that's now before us is such a case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

But it is not easy to get equitable tolling.  You have 

2

to be especially deserving. 

3

 So isn't that the answer to it? 

Ordinarily, 

4

the statute of limitations will govern, but if there are 

5

equitable reasons, then there can be an exception.  But 

6

those reasons have to be very strong. 

7

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Your Honor, I think that's 

8

true, that's how the equitable tolling doctrine has been 

9

conceived and if Congress were rewriting the statute 

10

today, it may well decide  it could well decide that 

11

that would be a better approach.  But the approach that 

12

Congress took at the time  and I think this is best 

13

reflected in the colloquy that's cited in page  on 

14

page 41 of our brief  Congress considered the question 

15

of whether in hardship cases it would be appropriate to 

16

give judges some discretion where there was a good 

17

reason for a  for a claimant to file late. 

18

 And that suggestion was raised by 

19

Congressman Gwynn and the Department of Justice  this 

20

was 2 years after the Act.  The Department of Justice 

21

said look, it would just be impractical and it would 

22

create too much of a burden on the government and it 

23

would be impractical to have kind of a rule that was not 

24

hard and fast. 

25

 And so Congress, in 1948, as that colloquy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

showed, did not think that the FTCA that had been passed 

2

two years earlier allowed for equitable tolling, and the 

3

consistent view of Congress when it rejected proposals 

4

to add tolling nine different times between 1946 and the 

5

late '80s was that equitable tolling should not be 

6

allowed. 

7

 And so in light of that statutespecific 

8

evidence, I think it's  it's eminently reasonable to 

9

conclude that  that, you know, the law is on our side. 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If you want to  I think 

11

it is quite funny, what I said.  I'm sorry.  Of course, 

12

the question is the law, all right.  I think what I said 

13

before is relevant to the law.  But the question here is 

14

a slightly more subtle one in my mind.  I agree with 

15

you, the legislative history, et cetera, does show they 

16

used "jurisdiction" nonstop.  Those are the words.  But 

17

"jurisdiction" at that time did not have the Irwin 

18

meaning. 

19

 And so later on, there comes a case, which 

20

case Irwin now treats this quite differently than it did 

21

before.  And isn't the question  or is the question 

22

from the legislative history point of view a pretty hard 

23

one to answer:  Did Congress or would those who passed 

24

the bill looking at the reasons wanted this statute to 

25

pick up the later interpretation of jurisdiction or they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

wanted it to have stayed the same in the face of that 

2

later change in how the courts treat the word. 

3

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

A living Federal Tort 

Claims Act is what we're talking about here. 

6

 (Laughter.) 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

9

I think 

That's actually right. 
Justice Breyer, I think 

that  I think that, first of all, what this Court has 

10

always said, of course, is that  that the goal of 

11

statutory construction in this context as in any other 

12

is to look at the text in light of its context and its 

13

historical treatment.  What Irwin says is that the goal 

14

is to find what the legislative intent was with respect 

15

to this particular statute. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  But you see, the 

17

question is  I mean, normally, it arises in a much 

18

grander context.  Normally, it arises in the context of 

19

changes of terms of the Constitution and so forth.  This 

20

is not that grand context.  But still, in this minor 

21

context, why isn't the question the same?  How did 

22

Congress  or would because it's hypothetical  they 

23

didn't know? 

24
25

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

It's not hypothetical, 

because I think Congress did actually address this exact

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

question.  31 bills were discussed between 1925 and 

2

1946, were proposed in Congress, involving tort claims, 

3

proposed tort claims bills.  9 of those bills 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

They didn't  they had the 

5

tolling.  They didn't pass it and normally what they 

6

didn't pass isn't something that's really great strong 

7

evidence in light of the meaning of what they did pass. 

8
9

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

That  that's normally true. 

But what this  what this Court said in the Muniz case 

10

is that in the particular context of the FTCA, because 

11

there was market reliance by each succeeding Congress 

12

on  on the bills that had been proposed earlier, that 

13

the omission of a  of a provision from the final FTCA 

14

that had been there before, we should treat that as a 

15

deliberate choice, not an inadvertent omission.  So I 

16

think it was a deliberate choice here. 

17

 And I think, with respect to the evolution 

18

of the statute since then, as of 1966, we know that 

19

Congress reexamined the time bar.  At that  at that 

20

point in time, it was legislating against a backdrop 

21

where this Court had suggested in Soriano that it was 

22

jurisdictional, the lower courts had uniformly treated 

23

it as jurisdictional, and not just by putting the label 

24

on it, but by attaching jurisdictional consequences. 

25

Congress reenacted the statute without any change in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

meaning, and then even until the late '80s, it 

2

repeatedly considered proposals to add forms of tolling 

3

to the statute. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If we were to adopt the 

5

position that a statute can change in light of current 

6

circumstances, what would that Congress think about it 

7

today, would there be any reason to limit that to the 

8

Federal Tort Claims Act, that proposition? 

9
10
11
12
13

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think it would be hard to 

do and, Your Honor 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We're into judge 

Calebresi's manner of statutory interpretation, right? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think it would be hard to 

14

do.  But most importantly for this case, I think that 

15

that approach would put  would essentially be at odds 

16

with Irwin, because Irwin says that what governs here is 

17

the legislative intent and that, obviously, I think, has 

18

to be ascertained at the time the statute was passed. 

19
20

 If I could reserve the balance of my time 
for rebuttal.

 Mr. Schnapper. 

23

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 

24

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1
2

it please the Court: 
 I think it would be helpful to start by 

3

pointing out that there are two different background 

4

rules at issue here.  The first is the rule in Irwin, 

5

which concerns the availability of equitable estoppel 

6

and, as my brother has pointed out, it is a presumption 

7

that statute of limitations are subject to equitable 

8

estoppel, and I think he aptly characterized its 

9

significant by saying it's a  it's a thumb on the 

10
11

scale. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But  but not with 

12

respect to governmental statutes.  I mean, that was a 

13

question of first impression in Irwin. 

14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Yes, the presumption is 

15

it's the same presumption.  But there's a second 

16

background rule here which is somewhat different, and 

17

that's the rule Justice Ginsburg pointed to earlier, and 

18

that concerns whether a statutory requirement is 

19

jurisdictional. 

20

 Now, there the line of cases are this 

21

Court's decisions from Arbaugh to Sebelius, such as last 

22

year, and the requirement there is a clear statement. 

23

And that's, a clear statement requirement, is 

24

considerably more demanding.  It's more like a whole 

25

hand on the scale.  It's not a search for intent in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1
2

same way that Irwin suggests. 
 This, the statutory requirement in this 

3

case, truly does not satisfy the clear statement 

4

requirement.  The language of 1346(a) provides that if 

5

six requirements are met the courts shall have 

6

jurisdiction.  So at this point, the burden is even 

7

greater.  The Federal Tort Claims Act is highly specific 

8

about things like that.  It  it  there is an express 

9

carveout for things deemed not jurisdictional for 

10

pension claims.  There is also a provision in Section 

11

2671 defining some of the terms in 1346.  Those would be 

12

jurisdictional.  But there is no connection between the 

13

statute of limitations and the jurisdictional 

14

provisions. 

15

 And if I might respectfully disagree with 

16

the government about one historical matter, the statute 

17

of limitations and the jurisdictional provision have 

18

always been separate.  The statute of limitations was in 

19

Section 420 of the original Act, and the jurisdictional 

20

provision was in Section 410.  And they had their own 

21

headings back in 1946, and the  the term  the 

22

heading "Jurisdiction" was only for the jurisdictional 

23

provision, not for Section 2401. 

24
25

 So the text of the statute simply doesn't 
provide the clear statement that is needed, and 

Alderson Reporting Company

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What did the re 

what did the recodification do? 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

It moved things to  to 

4

different parts of 28 U.S.C., but it  those sections 

5

were separate all along. 

6

 The  and in this regard we agree with the 

7

government, the view advanced by the government in its 

8

briefs in Zipes and Arbaugh, which is that when a  a 

9

statute of limitations and a jurisdictional provision 

10

are in separate provisions of the statute, which they 

11

always have been, that that gives rise to a strong 

12

presumption that they are not jurisdictional. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

So did we err in McNeil? 
Sorry? 
Did we err in McNeil? 
You did not but  but 

17

McNeil does not hold that the exhaustion requirement is 

18

jurisdictional.  We disagree with the government about 

19

that.  The district court had held the requirement was 

20

jurisdictional.  This Court held only that the 

21

requirement hadn't been satisfied. 

22

 If the Court had used the word 

23

"jurisdiction" it wouldn't have been any consequence; it 

24

would have been, as the Court's phrase goes, a driveby 

25

jurisdictional ruling.  But this is less than that.  The

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

government asked the Court in McNeil to label that 

2

requirement jurisdictional and it didn't.  So McNeil is 

3

an unsuccessful solicitation of a driveby 

4

jurisdictional rule.  It simply doesn't provide the 

5

support that you suggest. 

6

 There would, in any event, have been some 

7

statutory argument there, because the jurisdictional 

8

excuse me, the exhaustion requirement in Section 2675 is 

9

in Chapter 171.  And the jurisdictional provision does 

10

contain the language "subject to Chapter 171."  But the 

11

statute of limitations is in sub  is in Chapter 161. 

12

There isn't that same crossreference. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Schnapper, what do 

14

you do with what I take to be the government's main 

15

argument?  They said here are these two statutes waiving 

16

the government's sovereign immunity.  The Tucker Act, no 

17

equitable tolling.  Tort Claims Act comes later, it uses 

18

a lot of the same language, it has the same object, so 

19

the Tort Claims Act should be interpreted in harmony 

20

with the Tucker Act. 

21

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

We think there are a number 

22

of problems with that argument.  It has various 

23

iterations and maybe I can separate them out. 

24
25

 One version of that is that the words "shall 
be forever barred" are inherently jurisdictional.  And

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

as we note in our brief, that language is in a number of 

2

other statutes.  The particular cadence of it, every act 

3

shall be forever barred unless, is also in the Clayton 

4

Act, which in Rotella this Court held was not 

5

jurisdictional, and it's in the Fair Labor Standards 

6

Act, which is  where the government repeatedly 

7

contends that equitable tolling is available. 

8

 So I think the  and indeed 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It isn't just that phrase. 

10

It's other language that is just lifted verbatim from 

11

the two prior Acts.  And you add to that the fact that 

12

the purpose of this statute was to eliminate the 

13

exception in the Tucker Act for torts.  The 

14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But 
That was the obvious 

16

purpose of it, so they  they repeat the language of 

17

the Tucker Act and say it applies to torts. 

18
19
20

 One would think that the same limitations 
that applied to the Tucker Act continue to apply. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, we  we think not, 

21

Your Honor.  The  again, the  the rest of the 

22

language of the Tucker Act and the Federal Tort Claims 

23

Act are very different.  There are 24 sections of the 

24

Federal Tort Claims Act, 35 sections of the Tucker Act. 

25

The rest of them have almost no overlap.  It's just this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

phrase, which is the same phrase in a number of other 

2

statutes. 

3

 But to get back to the government's 

4

historical point about the meaning  about the pre1946 

5

decisions, as we've suggested in our brief, those 

6

decisions never turn on the words "shall be forever 

7

barred."  A series of decisions dating from the 1883 

8

decision in Kendall took the position  and that was 

9

the view in the 19th century  that any requirement 

10

pertinent to a waiver of sovereign immunity was 

11

jurisdictional, no matter what it was. 

12

 And if the Court were to look at the 

13

critical paragraph in the decision in Kendall which the 

14

government relies on, the first four sentences of that 

15

paragraph are an exposition of that rule:  Any 

16

requirement, any bar, is jurisdictional. 

17

 Then the fifth sentence says: 

So what are 

18

the bars in the Tucker Act, and then it notess that there 

19

is a statute of limitations which has the language that 

20

applies here.  But if Congress had been familiar with 

21

those details, and we presume that sort of thing, though 

22

it's not entirely realistic, they would not have drawn 

23

from those decisions the view that the language of the 

24

Tucker Act was of any significance, because it wasn't to

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I take it from what you 

2

have both argued so far, that there is nothing direct in 

3

terms of a report or a hearing or a statement on the 

4

floor that shows that anyone in Congress, staff or 

5

member, ever thought about this problem.  Is that right? 

6
7
8
9

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

That's our  that's our 

argument 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So what we're doing then is 

we are, however we do it, creating a number  not 

10

creating but following a number of legal rules, court 

11

developed, which seek to determine what the, quote, 

12

intent of Congress was on the basis of other things, not 

13

necessarily what they said or what they  that's the 

14

situation? 

15

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I  I think that's right. 

16

And we rely on the rules and on Arbaugh in cases about 

17

jurisdictional requirements, and in Irwin about  about 

18

equitable tolling. 

19

 If  as I was  just one more point about 

20

Irwin.  As we noted in our brief, at the oral argument 

21

in Irwin counsel for the United States pointed out that 

22

that language, "shall be forever barred," was not of any 

23

distinctive importance and suggested it was probably 

24

language from the 19th century that was just common. 

25

And that's true; most States used that very language at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34

the time.  It was just  it wasn't of any particular 

2

independent significance. 

3

 With regard to the question asked by Justice 

4

Scalia about the living Federal Tort Claims Act and what 

5

we're to do about the fact that the principles of 

6

interpretation in Irwin and the Arbaugh line of cases 

7

weren't on the table back in 1946:  This issue has come 

8

up in at least four cases and the Court has, although in 

9

one instance over your dissent, taken the position that 

10

when those rules are applied they don't have effective 

11

dates.  They apply to all statutes. 

12
13
14

 In Soriano  excuse me, in  excuse me, 
in 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, it seems to me that 

15

is incompatible with what I thought your position was, 

16

that it depends upon congressional intent.  So we can 

17

just ignore everything you've argued up to here.  It 

18

doesn't depend upon congressional intent because we can 

19

give those words meaning that the Congress did not give 

20

them at the time.  You have to pick one argument or the 

21

other. 

22

 MR. SCHNAPPER:

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

We agree with Justice Breyer 

2

that this  that this  it's not a question of  of 

3

any indication of actual intent.  The Court has taken 

4

the position that when new rules of this sort are 

5

adopted, they are applied to laws that didn't exist that 

6

were adopted before that.  In your decision for the 

7

Court in Young v. United States is a perfect example of 

8

that.  In the  I'm sorry, that's wrong.  Your decision 

9

of the Court in Sandoval is an example of that.  In 

10

Sandoval, the issue was somewhat different.  It was 

11

whether to imply a private cause of action.  And since 

12

the Court's decision in Cort v. Ash, this Court has had 

13

a somewhat more fairly demanding standard.  But counsel 

14

for the plaintiff in that case, myself, argued that 

15

since the statute involved had been adopted under the 

16

Ancien Regime back in the days of J.I. Case v. Borak, 

17

that rule should apply.  And you, the Court, unanimously 

18

rejected that argument.  And it made  it made the 

19

point, which is completely applicable here, the Cort 

20

v.  the statute in Cort v. Ash had also been enacted 

21

under the Ancien Regime back before the days of Cort v. 

22

Ash, but that was the way the Court was going to apply 

23

it. 

24
25

 That's precisely the situation here with 
regard to Irwin.  Irwin is a statute adopted under the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

Ancien Regime as you said.  Arbaugh is a statute adopted 

2

before Arbaugh.  Those rules are applied to all 

3

statutes.  Now, if there's an affirmative demonstration 

4

of actual intent, if something was discussed as Justice 

5

Breyer says, that might be a different matter. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This is  this is spinning 

7

out into degrees of abstraction that I hadn't 

8

anticipated.  But it's hard for me to believe that 

9

Congress really had any intent whatsoever on  on these 

10

issues.  I don't envision members of Congress sitting 

11

around thinking about these things.  But put that aside. 

12

Do you  is it your argument that we should follow 

13

congressional intent or not?  Or is it your argument 

14

that Congress's intent was to adopt  to say this is 

15

jurisdictional and we delegate, basically, to the courts 

16

the  the determination of what is jurisdictional?  So 

17

if they change their mind about the difference between 

18

jurisdiction and nonjurisdiction, then that's what this 

19

should mean.  Which  which is it? 

20

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I think the Court's 

21

answer  the cases in this Court give a slightly 

22

different answer to that question.  With regard to 

23

whether something is jurisdictional, the clear statement 

24

rule is a clear statement rule.  It's like any number of 

25

rules like that from the Court.  Something  a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

particularly clear expression of the views of Congress 

2

would do, but it is not quite the same subjective intent 

3

for a search for intent that we might otherwise have. 

4

But certainly, the Court 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So it's not what Congress 

6

intended.  You're saying that if they intended to  all 

7

they thought about was they had one idea about 

8

jurisdiction, they couldn't conceive of another one, 

9

they wanted it to be jurisdictional in accordance with 

10

their idea, but that would change.  If  if others 

11

if courts begin to think of jurisdiction differently. 

12

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, I think my answer is 

13

not limited to this clear statement rule.  The Court has 

14

articulated a number of clear statement rules.  I don't 

15

understand those rules to just drop from the case and 

16

then lead to the usual wideranging search for 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Schnapper, I think 

18

we're getting off the track that Justice Breyer put us 

19

on, and I think you agreed with him, that there's no 

20

evidence that Congress ever thought anything about what 

21

was going to happen in a case like Ms. Wong.  They 

22

they enacted a statute, and it had a statute of 

23

limitations, a firm statute of limitations, but there's 

24

no indication that Congress thought about jurisdiction. 

25

We all  all that jurisdiction stuff comes from

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

decisions of this Court. 

2

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Yes.  And I think in that 

3

circumstance, the  the Court's choice of controlling 

4

background presumptions and clear statement of rules are 

5

controlling. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but that 

7

language  that language comes from decisions of this 

8

Court, exactly.  But interpreting the precise language 

9

that was put into this act in the same context ais the 

10

Tucker Act.  They were addressing a problem under the 

11

Tucker Act, they used that language.  And whatever 

12

criticism you want to direct to the prior decisions of 

13

the Court, they have issued  they had issued rulings 

14

on those when the Congress was looking at the FTCA. 

15

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

But those rulings, we 

16

contend, had nothing to do with the particular language 

17

of the Tucker Act. 

18
19
20
21
22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that may well be, 

but 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

No matter what  how the 

statute of limitations had been phrased 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Look, there are a lot of 

23

statutes, perhaps most statutes, that are not explicit. 

24

That do not use the magic language that you insist this 

25

statute have.  And when that happens, we don't just sit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

back and say, well, in that case, it's up to us.  We 

2

don't say that.  We have certain rules that  that 

3

determine what the presumptive intent of Congress was. 

4

And I don't care whether each individual member of 

5

Congress or, indeed, any single one of them had that in 

6

mind.  They ordinarily don't.  But we have rules, one of 

7

which that is very strong, is that when you adopt the 

8

language from another statute  especially when it is 

9

in the same area, and this is the same area as the 

10

Tucker Act, it is eliminating the Tucker Act exemption 

11

for torts.  When you have the same language and it has 

12

been  that language has been interpreted by the courts 

13

uniformly over a period of years to mean a certain 

14

thing, we will presume that that is what Congress had in 

15

mind when it used the language. 

16

 Now, if you're asking us to abandon that 

17

rule and just sit back in  in any case when the 

18

legislative history doesn't say anything and  and make 

19

up what we think should be the best answer, that simply 

20

is not the way we've proceeded. 

21
22
23

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Nor should it be, Your 

Honor. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Didn't  I mean, the 

24

sorry, but I get  I mean, what about many statutes 

25

existed saying  inferring a certain use of the word

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

about men sitting on juries.  And the statutes that say 

2

those things were enacted long before anyone thought a 

3

woman would ever sit on a jury.  But when they're 

4

interpreted by the courts, by and large, they're 

5

interpreted to include both genders.  All right?  There 

6

are many instances.  So certainly Justice Scalia is 

7

right in my opinion that that is a rule that  the one 

8

he enunciates, but neither an absolutely firm rule nor 

9

the only rule. 

10
11
12
13
14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, I'm happy to agree 

with all that.  But  but I think where we 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You think man means women, 

right?  Never mind. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I don't think we have to 

15

address all that here.  I'm sure you'll have another 

16

opportunity 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Schnapper  Mr. 

19

Schnapper, I think that I heard a disagreement between 

20

you and Justice Scalia on how close the words were, and 

21

you said, yes, there are some phrases in common, but 

22

there are big differences, too, in the wording of the 

23

Tort Claims Act.  So you can pick out some words and 

24

say, yes, Congress adopted that language, but in other 

25

parts it didn't take the Tucker Act as the model used

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1
2

different language. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

That's true.  And, in fact, 

3

there are some fundamental differences between the 

4

statutes and we think they're important here.  One of 

5

them is the point that was raised earlier that 

6

Section 2674 says that in proceedings under the Federal 

7

Tort Claims Act, defendant, the United States, would be 

8

liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a 

9

private defendant in a private action in State court, 

10

equitable tolling would be the  the rule.  Now, there 

11

are a number of specific exceptions to the language of 

12

2674, but none of them apply here.  And we think 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but that's 

14

a  a principle that obviously doesn't cut across the 

15

board. 

16

 In private actions in State court, for 

17

example, you do not have to give the administrative 

18

agency notice within two years, there are all sorts of 

19

things that don't have a particular carveout that 

20

don't apply 

21

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

No, no.  That is  that is 

22

one of the carveouts, that you have to give notice. 

23

It's in the

25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

No, no. 

 the Federal Torts Claims

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1
2

Act. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no.  You're 

3

misunderstanding my point.  In other words, just because 

4

the law says the United States will be liable to the 

5

same extent as a private party, it doesn't mean that all 

6

the rules  I mean in State court  it doesn't mean 

7

that all the rules that apply in  that you interpret 

8

them the same way across the board.  There is no 

9

requirement that you give a twoyears notice in the 

10

typical State court action.  But under your theory, 

11

well, there ought to be  do you understand where I'm 

12

headed? 

13

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I do.  But  but our view 

14

is that having announced that general principle in 2674, 

15

Congress then went on in the Federal Tort Claims Act and 

16

spelled out a series of express areas where it 

17

designated a different Federal answer.  And one of them 

18

is the presentment requirement, that actually went so 

19

far as to say the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are 

20

going to apply.  There's a whole series, though.  There 

21

are listed in Footnote 28 in United States v. Richards. 

22

Section 2680 has 17 other exceptions 

23
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And you think in 

every other 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

If Congress wanted a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1
2

different result, they spelled that out. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And you think in 

3

every other respect, the procedure under the Federal 

4

action is the same as under the State action? 

5

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Presumptively 
And it goes  it 

7

goes to liability, right?  That's the word that's used? 

8

Liability? 

9
10
11

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, it says in  in like 

manner.  I mean 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

They're not 

12

procedures.  I mean, the procedures are different, 

13

obviously. 

14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Yes, but a  a statute of 

15

limitations is a bar to liability.  And it  this isn't 

16

just a question of how many depositions you  you would 

17

get 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You know, I don't find the 

19

 the existence of  of those exceptions, and there 

20

are a lot of exceptions, so persuasive, because unlike 

21

the Tucker Act, the Tort Claims Act refers to State law, 

22

so you have to make exceptions unless you're going to 

23

suck in everything about State law, procedures and 

24

everything else. 

25

 So, you know, it's sort of apples and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

oranges.  The fact that those exceptions are there are 

2

explicable not because Congress didn't think 

3

jurisdiction meant jurisdiction in the narrow sense, 

4

but, rather, because having referred us to State law, 

5

they had to make some exceptions from State law. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Isn't your point, 

7

however, that this is a new regime, that it's not the 

8

Tucker Act, that it's something created  they may have 

9

borrowed from the Tucker Act some phrases and a couple 

10

of things, but they created a new statute.  So to say 

11

they were wholesale taking the Tucker Act or even 

12

considering that they were duplicating the Tucker Act is 

13

not appropriate. 

14
15
16

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I  I think that's right. 

As we said, most of the statutes are entirely different. 
 There's also another fundamental difference, 

17

which is the claims recognized by the Tucker Act were 

18

sent to the then newlycreated Federal court of claims, 

19

which only had whatever powers Congress was going to 

20

give it as it created them.  But 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The government answered 

22

 you're saying the difference is the district court 

23

has all kinds of equitable authority, claims court 

24

didn't.  But the government answered that argument and 

25

said there's a difference between equitable doctrines,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

which the claims court followed, it's just that the 

2

claims court can't give equitable remedies like 

3

injunction. 

4

 So the government's answer is isn't that 

5

divide, that equity is part of the jurisprudence of the 

6

claims court? 

7

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I think that argument 

8

relates to the argument that's been made by the 

9

Plaintiffs in June.  I'm making a different point, which 

10

is  the point that would go, for example, to the 

11

presumption of equitable tolling and the standards of 

12

that articulated in this Court's decision in Holland v. 

13

Florida. 

14

 The Federal district courts already existed 

15

in 1946.  They had the inherent power to engage in 

16

equitable tolling.  There were no inherent powers in the 

17

court of claims in  in 1863.  It didn't exist. 

18

Holland says that if Congress  that the fact that 

19

those powers were already there matters, and that 

20

there's going to have to be a strong showing that 

21

Congress, in adopting a statute, meant to take away the 

22

powers that normally existed.  That problem doesn't 

23

exist under the Tucker Act because there  there were 

24

no powers to take away the  the courts were just being 

25

created at that time.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

 If I could turn for a second from the issue 

2

of  of jurisdiction to the issue of equitable tolling, 

3

because the  the issues there are somewhat different. 

4

That is, the government suggests even if the statute is 

5

not jurisdictional, whether there's equitable tolling is 

6

a separate question. 

7

 The  the government's argument relies 

8

primarily on the fact that a number of other statutes 

9

had statutory tolling provisions.  They are labeled 

10

exclusions in the case of Section 2416.  And the 

11

government argues that if there are  there's some sort 

12

of statutory exclusion, or sometimes it's called tolling 

13

in this Court's decisions, that would mean Congress 

14

didn't want equitable tolling. 

15

 Now, that issue has been litigated before 

16

this Court several times.  It was litigated in Young v. 

17

United States where the taxpayer made the same argument 

18

that since there was a statutory exclusion or tolling 

19

provision, there couldn't be equitable tolling.  This 

20

Court rejected it there, and the Court's opinion said 

21

that the  the statutory provisions and equitable 

22

tolling supplemented one another.  The Court rejected it 

23

as well in Holland v. Florida. 

24
25

 Now, there's an historical reason for all 
that.  Tolling provisions or exclusions in statutes have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

always coexisted with equitable tolling, going back 

2

hundreds of years.  The original English Statute of 

3

Limitations Act of 1623 had five exclusions in it.  In fact, 

4

4 of the 5 exclusions in the Tucker Act came from that. 

5

And yet despite the fact that English statutes of 

6

limitations always had exclusions and they're carried 

7

over in colonial and  and American State legislation, 

8

there has also been equitable tolling.  The two things 

9

coexist and supplement one another. 

10

 And often, although not inherently, the 

11

statutory provisions operate differently than equitable 

12

tolling.  Equitable tolling is an individualized, a 

13

somewhat discretionary choice, and it requires a showing 

14

of hardship applicable to the individual.  The statutory 

15

exclusions do not.  The statutory exclusions are there 

16

whether the  the plaintiff had a compelling problem or 

17

not. 

18

 So, for example, in the Tucker Act and 

19

indeed in the original English statute of limitations, 

20

there is a carveout for people who are beyond the seas, 

21

and the statute of limitations doesn't begin to run as 

22

to them until they come back.  That exists even if 

23

they're just across the channel in Calais and have a 

24

fulltime agent in London to manage their affairs. 

25

There's not a requirement of  of hardship.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

 So the government's argument, I think, 

2

misapprehends the fact  the history of all of this and 

3

the fact that these two provisions have always 

4

coexisted.  And the government's legislative history 

5

argument is  largely fails on the same ground.  What 

6

Congress did not adopt in the years prior to the Federal 

7

Torts Claim Act were  were tolling  statutory 

8

tollings.  They  and I think you could make a fairly 

9

good argument that Congress decided not to have 

10

statutory tolling rules, but they have always been 

11

separate from equitable tolling rules. 

12
13
14
15

 The government, in its argument in Younger, 
made this point really well.  I think it's about

statutes that permit equitable tolling 

16

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

18

Are there any Federal

 and how are they 

worded?  Do they say  do they say equitable tolling? 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Oh, no.  I don't know that 

20

one exists.  But there are in any number of Federal 

21

statutes which have statutory tolling where the court 

22

has held there's also equitable tolling.  That was Young 

23

and Holland. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But based on the language 

of the statute, there are carveouts.  And  and as you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49

actually explained 

2

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

The carveouts are statutory. 

3

The equitable tolling was always there, but what 

4

the Court said was the carveouts 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But have the statutes 

6

recognized, A, there are carveouts, and B, there is 

7

something like equitable tolling? 

8

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

9

 But  but what the courts' decisions hold 

I don't know that. 

10

is the existence of a statutory carveout does not 

11

preclude 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

13

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I understand. 
 that discretion.  And the 

14

 the legislative proposals that the court  that the 

15

government refers to for a carveout may reflect, I think 

16

it fairly does reflect a decision by Congress not to 

17

have a statutory carveout, that doesn't mean Congress 

18

was intending to bar equitable tolling.  They're 

19

they've always been different and separate.  And as

the Court said in Young, they supplement one another.

2

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Martinez, I hate to cut 

3

into your time, but it's important to me to understand 

4

why you think that if we rule for you, we will not be 

5

saying that every statute which allows suit against the 

6

Federal government and which uses the words "shall be 

7

forever barred" will not have to come out this way. 

8

What distinguishes this case from all those others? 

9

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think in this case it's not 

10

just that phrase, it's the broader phrase that was 

11

lifted verbatim from the Tucker Act.  And to my 

12

knowledge, there's no other statute that's been cited 

13

in  in their brief, there's no other statute that I'm 

14

aware of that's currently in effect that  that borrows 

15

that same language from the Tucker Act. 

16

20

 And I think what's  what this Court could 
also do 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm sorry, which language 

are you talking about? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I'm talking about the phrase, 

21

"Every claim against the United States cognizable shall 

22

be forever barred unless."  So I think you could 

23

limit 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I mean, "shall be forever 

barred" seems, to me, to be the most important part of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1
2

that language. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think that is the most 

3

important part.  But I think that it's the incorporation 

4

of the entire phrase that can give the Court confidence 

5

that what Congress was doing here was directly lifting 

6

something from the Tucker Act. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

2401 just says, "A tort 

8

claim against the United States."  I don't know how else 

9

you would say it, where else you would borrow it from if 

10

what you're interested in is making sure that the U.S. 

11

is responsible, that you're effectuating a waiver of 

12

sovereign immunity. 

13

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Justice Sotomayor, I think 

14

the language that I'm referring to is the one that was 

15

in the original 1946 FTCA, which tracked verbatim the 

16

language from the Tucker Act.  And so I think  I think 

17

that this Court can issue a narrow opinion that's 

18

focused on the FTCA that emphasizes that that was 

19

that language was  was lifted verbatim, it was 

20

essentially cut and pasted from the Tucker Act, and it 

21

was intended to  to bring along with it

this Court said in John R. Sand & Gravel was that the 

2

minor changes that had been made to  to the Tucker Act 

3

language were essentially insignificant.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is there anything else you 

5

would say to Justice Scalia is it's just "shall be 

6

forever barred" plus a few more words?  Anything else? 

7

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Justice Kagan, I think it's 

8

the same points that I made in response to your question 

9

earlier.  I think there are a bunch of other features of 

10

this particular statute of limitations; the fact that 

11

the Court had addressed it in Soriano, the fact that 

12

the Court addressed it, although perhaps in dicta, in 

13

Kontrick; the private laws that had expressly addressed 

14

this particular statute; the fact that it was reenacted 

15

in 1966 against a consistent backdrop of incorporation.

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

As far as Kontrick is 

18

concerned, that line of cases I thought came out with 

19

Bowles, Bowles v. Russell, and John R. Sand that we're 

20

not going to undeclare something jurisdictional that we, 

21

the Court, but when it's  we're dealing with a statute 

22

that this Court has never said that about, then we don't 

23

carry over that ancient regime. 

24
25

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Justice Ginsburg, I think in 

 in footnote 8 of the Kontrick opinion, this Court

Alderson Reporting Company

referred to 2401(b) and it said that it confined review 

2

of district courts and was of a similar order to 28 

3

U.S.C.  2107, which was the provision that was later at 

4

issue in Bowles.  And in Bowles this Court referred to 

5

footnote 8 of Kontrick and used that footnote which 

6

referred to 2107 and to the time bar of the FTCA and it 

7

used that footnote as a reason to conclude that 2107 was 

8

jurisdictional.  And we think the same conclusion 

9

follows here.  I think the key point about this

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I better take another 

look at Kontrick. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

And Bowles, with respect, 

Justice Ginsburg. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

In Bowles I was in 

dissent. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I  I seem to remember that, 

17

Justice Ginsburg.  But I think the Court's opinion in 

18

Bowles expressly addressed the meaning of that Kontrick 

19

footnote. 

20

 I, think, stepping back a little bit from 

21

the weeds here that we've been discussing, my colleague 

22

and I have been getting into the details of the 

23

legislative history, I think the big picture here is 

24

that Congress, from the 1920s through the 1980s, 

25

repeatedly engaged with the issue of equitable tolling

and at every turn it signaled its intent not to allow 


2


equitable tolling.

 We ask for reversal.
