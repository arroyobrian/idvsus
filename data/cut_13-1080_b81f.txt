 (11:08 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

next this morning in Case 131080, Department of 

5

Transportation v. Association of American Railroads. 

6

 Mr. Gannon. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9

 MR. GANNON: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 The court of appeals held that Section 207 

12

of PRIIA was unconstitutional because it believed that 

13

the statute constituted an actual delegation of 

14

regulatory authority to a private entity.  And none of 

15

those three things is true about this statute. 

16

 First, under Lebron, Amtrak should not be 

17

considered a private corporation for nondelegation 

18

purposes.  Second, the metrics and standards are not 

19

regulatory.  The regulatory effect here comes from the 

20

longstanding statutory preference requirement, which was 

21

enacted by Congress, not Amtrak, and is enforced by an 

22

independent adjudicative agency, the Surface 

23

Transportation Board.  And third 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

 MR. GANNON: 

Go ahead, please. 
And third, requiring Amtrak to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

approve the metrics and standards before they went into 

2

effect is not a delegation outside the government under 

3

this Court's cases. 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I think the Lebron 

5

argument, Marsh v. Alabama, the company town case, no 

6

one says that it was a governmental agency.  It was just 

7

exercising governmentallike powers which entitled the 

8

person to exercise free speech.  That's all Lebron can 

9

stand for.  You wouldn't say that Marsh v. Alabama, the 

10

company town, was a governmental agency after reading 

11

that opinion, would you? 

12

 MR. GANNON: 

No.  I would say that after 

13

reading the opinion in Lebron, that the Court concluded 

14

that Amtrak is a governmental entity for things that 

15

Congress doesn't have control over. 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, you could say the 

same thing about Marsh v. Alabama. 
 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think that the 

19

difference is that the Court recognized in Lebron that 

20

Amtrak is a governmentcreated corporation that is under 

21

the government's control and that under the government's 

22

control both because of the management control that it 

23

has over it and because it created the purposes for 

24

which Amtrak exists and the things that it has to do. 

25

And then the Court there distinguished between whether Amtrak

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

is governmental for constitutional purposes that were 

2

beyond Congress's control, but acknowledged that 

3

Congress could control whether Amtrak was governmental 

4

for other purposes, other powers and privileges of 

5

government. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If Amtrak is governmental 

7

for nondelegation purposes, is it also governmental for 

8

appointments clause purposes? 

9

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think that that follows 

10

from the  the way the Court approached the question 

11

about the PCAOB and Free Enterprise Fund where Congress 

12

had also enacted a statute that said the PCAOB was not 

13

an agency or instrumentality of government, that no 

14

board members or employees were going to be considered 

15

officers or employees of the Federal government.  The 

16

parties in that case, which included the United States, 

17

did not dispute that the appointments clause and 

18

separation of powers concerns that were at issue there 

19

were applicable to the PCAOB, notwithstanding those 

20

general statements by Congress.  And we do think here 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I was just going to 

22

say your argument that Amtrak is governmental for 

23

purposes of  that doesn't get you to the finish line, 

24

right?  I mean, if you had a law that said the 

25

Department of Defense and the Department of State will

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

consult and jointly issue regulations and if they don't, 

2

this private individual resolved it for them, that would 

3

still present the same problems. 

4

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think, 

5

Mr. Chief Justice, you are referring to the arbitrator 

6

provision. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

 MR. GANNON: 

9

Right. 

Before we get to the arbitrator 

provision, I do think that  that this would resolve 

10

the question.  And ultimately, if this is not regulatory 

11

authority that cannot be conditioned 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, it wouldn't resolve 

13

the question.  Only  only perhaps for delegation 

14

purposes.  But  but it doesn't resolve the  the 

15

other issue in the case, which is due process.  That is 

16

to say, even if this is a governmental entity, there are 

17

some things that governmental entities can't do.  And, 

18

indeed, I think that the case law in this area relies on 

19

the due process clause more than on the distinction 

20

simply between public and private entities. 

21

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, to be sure, the Carter 

22

Coal case talked about both nondelegation ideas and also 

23

due process issues.  We  we would be surprised if 

24

the Court wanted to decide the due process issue here 

25

since it wasn't decided by the court of appeals.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MR. GANNON: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4
5

It was raised. 
It certainty was raised. 
And it's  and it's argued 

here. 
 MR. GANNON: 

It  it has been argued in the 

6

red brief here.  And we do think that we're correct on 

7

the merits with respect to the due process issue and 

8

that  for two principal reasons.  One is that what is 

9

at stake here is not the equivalent of what was going on 

10

in the due process cases.  This is not like the 

11

delicensing of optometrists in the Gibson v. Berryhill 

12

case.  It's not like the wage and hour requirements in 

13

Carter Coal, because  because the analogy to those 

14

things here is the statutory preference requirement 

15

rather than the antecedent metrics and standards. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.  But the statutory 

17

preference requirement requires  would require 

18

consideration of whatever is determined by this body, 

19

right? 

20

 MR. GANNON: 

The statutory preference 

21

requirement is independent of the metrics and standards 

22

and preexists them.  That is what the Surface 

23

Transportation Board would be enforcing in a proceeding 

24

under Section 24308(f).  The metrics and standards 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What must it consider?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

 MR. GANNON: 

The metrics and standards play 

2

a triggering and gatekeeping role.  The  these 

3

provisions are reprinted in the government's brief on 

4

pages 15A and 16A of the appendix, that the  the 

5

investigation by the Surface Transportation Board is 

6

triggered by their having been a failure by Amtrak to 

7

satisfy the metrics and standards.  But I think that 

8

that  that is  and if we're talking about the due 

9

process cases, that is not the prohibition that 

10

the Court has been concerned about.  If you look at 

11

cases like Roberge, which talked about Cusack, it said 

12

that it's okay to have something that is presumptively 

13

bad banned by the legislature. 

14

 Here, the analogy to that is the statutory 

15

preference, and it's okay, then, to allow a private 

16

party to relax its application in certain circumstances. 

17

And we think that's the role that the metrics and 

18

standards play here, because Congress could have allowed 

19

Amtrak to ask for an STB investigation into violations 

20

of the statute any time it wanted to.  And instead what 

21

they said is that it is only  you are only going to 

22

get that investigation when you have failed to  to 

23

perform at an adequate level such that we think there's 

24

been adequate injury.  And then in that investigation, 

25

you are going to have to establish that the injury to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1
2

you was caused by the violation of the statute. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So in your  in your 

3

view, the case would come out the same way if Amtrak 

4

could issue these metrics and standards entirely on its 

5

own, without consultation with the  or cooperation 

6

with the government.  Same  same case 

7

 MR. GANNON: 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9

 MR. GANNON: 

One of the 
 same result? 
One prong of our argument is, 

10

yes, that because this is not regulatory in that sense, 

11

this is more like the neighbors being able to veto the 

12

billboard in the neighborhood in Cusack, which the Court 

13

said was okay in Roberge, because the statutory 

14

preference is presumptively bad.  Violations of the 

15

statutory preference by the freight railroads were the 

16

thing that Congress wanted to be enforceable here, and 

17

the metrics and standards just cabin the circumstances 

18

in which Amtrak can seek that type of enforcement. 

19

 If I could return to the Chief Justice's 

20

question about the 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You may.  You may. 
That doesn't stop  do 

23

the metes and standards stop you from initiating or stop 

24

the agency from initiating a review, even if a carrier 

25

meets the metes and standard?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, it's  it's not the 

2

carrier.  It's not the host railroad that would meet the 

3

standards. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5

 MR. GANNON: 

6
7

No, it would be 
It would be Amtrak's own 

performance. 
 But there is  there is  that would 

8

depend upon the reading of the beginning clause of 

9

(f)(1) which refers to if ontime performance fails to 

10

satisfy 80 percent for two consecutive quarters or the 

11

service quality isn't complied with for two quarters, 

12

then those are the circumstances in which an 

13

investigation could be requested and  in which 

14

instance the STB would need to start the investigation 

15

or the STB could initiate the investigation. 

16

 And there is an open question about that 

17

first clause about whether the 80 percent ontime 

18

performance reference is something that has to be 

19

predicated upon the metrics and standards.  That's been 

20

briefed before the Surface Transportation Board in the 

21

proceeding brought against Canadian National, the 

22

complaint of which is reprinted  a snippet from which 

23

is reprinted at the end of the joint appendix.  And so 

24

the question there would be whether ontime performance 

25

there depends upon a prePRIIA definition rather than

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1
2
3
4

the ones that are included in the metrics and standards. 
 So there's a possibility that the agency 
could 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If we were  if we were 

5

to rule that this is not a regulatory action, would that 

6

satisfy the entire case?  We wouldn't have to go to the 

7

delegation issue or to whether it was public or private, 

8

et cetera. 

9

 MR. GANNON: 

I  I think that that is 

10

right.  And I think even in those circumstances, because 

11

it  because if it's not regulatory, it's okay for 

12

private persons to have that power, and I think that 

13

would cover even the question of whether  if  if the 

14

arbitrator is assumed to be private.  That is not what 

15

we think is the case. 

16
17

 And we also think that we don't have to win 
on that agreement either on  on the question of 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

On 
If the  if the 

20

actions are not regulatory, why  why did Amtrak's 

21

performance drop dramatically as soon as the Court 

22

issued its decision in this case? 

23

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think that's because of 

24

the  that had decreased the threat of enforcement of 

25

the statutory preference.  I do think that the  it is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

the statutory preference that is having the regulatory 

2

impact here.  The freight railroads are not going to be 

3

held liable for Amtrak's failure to satisfy the metrics 

4

and standards.  They're going to be held liable for 

5

failing to 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

They're going to 

7

be  Amtrak can then force a proceeding at which the 

8

freight carriers will have to defend, right? 

9
10
11

 MR. GANNON: 

That  that is correct.  And 

the same thing 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that's a 

12

significant regulatory impact, to tell railroads I, a 

13

private party, get to start a governmental proceeding 

14

and you have to show up to defend it. 

15
16
17

 MR. GANNON: 

Yes.  But that  that 

happens 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And, by the way, if 

18

I don't  it's triggered if I don't comply with 

19

standards that I get to set. 

20

 MR. GANNON: 

It's  but we allow private 

21

parties to initiate governmental investigations and 

22

enforcement proceedings all the time, either before 

23

administrative agencies or courts, and we don't think 

24

that that is a delegation of legislative power 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Gannon 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1
2
3

 MR. GANNON: 

 to the person who is 

beginning the investigation. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is the  is the government 

4

able to award damages without the showing that there's 

5

been a violation of the metrics and standards? 

6

 MR. GANNON: 

No.  That is  that is going 

7

to be a threshold determination.  But as I said, that is 

8

a  it's serving as a threshold gatekeeping function 

9

to  of  of limiting the circumstances in which the 

10
11

investigation can begin and when there will be damages. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I would think if that's 

12

the case, if the statutory preference does not get  is 

13

a  if a violation of the statutory preference doesn't 

14

get you all the way to damages, if there is essentially 

15

a second requirement which is a violation of the metrics 

16

and standards, I mean, in effect what the  a statute 

17

does is it says there are two things you need to show, a 

18

violation of the preference and a violation of the 

19

metrics and standards, in order to get to damages.  That 

20

seems  if  if that's the case, it seems kind of 

21

regulatory. 

22

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I  I  I understand 

23

the impulse, but I think that seems  it  it also 

24

seems like the ability of the neighbors to veto the 

25

billboards in Cusack because what Amtrak  all Amtrak

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

has done is relax certain circumstances in which the 

2

freight railroads can be held liable for violating the 

3

statutory preference.  A violation of the statutory 

4

preference is presumptively a bad thing. 

5

 And what has happened here is Congress has 

6

recognized that if it doesn't actually cause Amtrak to 

7

be  to have sufficiently subpar performance, then we 

8

are not going to make a Federal case out of it and we're 

9

not going to let Amtrak do so.  But  and  and there 

10

aren't going to be damages at the end of the day. 

11

 But I do think that the realworld reason of 

12

why the freight railroads had greater incentive to 

13

cooperate and Amtrak believes that it was their 

14

cooperation under the regime in which the metrics and 

15

standards were in effect, and there was still the 

16

possibility that there would be enforcement proceedings 

17

before the STB to determine whether the freight 

18

railroads had failed to comply with the statute 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The statute says that the 
Can we  can we get back 

21

to the arbitrator?  I think the Chief asked that 

22

question that  and we passed it and assume it's 

23

regulatory. 

24

 MR. GANNON: 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
The arbitrator, it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

argued, need not be a government officer.  It could be a 

2

private officer.  I have a question to ask about that 

3

provision. 

4

 Is it  is this a onetime operation, that 

5

is, the setting these metrics and standards?  In  in 

6

fact, there was no arbitrator in this picture.  Will 

7

there be a renewal of this, a repetition where there 

8

might be an arbitrator? 

9

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I  I don't think that 

10

the terms of 207(d) contemplate that the arbitrator will 

11

come into effect again.  I think that because the 

12

beginning of it says that it  it is only triggered if 

13

a development of the metrics and standard is not 

14

completed within the 180day period required by 

15

subsection (a), which is the 180 days after PRIIA was 

16

enacted in 2008. 

17
18
19

 And so the arbitration provision was, I 
think, good for one time only.  It was never invoked. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but does that 

20

matter?  I mean, the idea is that having the 

21

arbitrator  arbitration provision there affected the 

22

issuance of the regulations. 

23

 MR. GANNON: 

Yes, I  I understand that 

24

question, Mr. Chief Justice.  I  I think that's 

25

it  it mattered the first time around.  To the extent

Alderson Reporting Company

16

that there may be any amendments to the metrics and

 MR. GANNON:

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 MR. GANNON: 

If 

 standards in the future 
Right. 

 the arbitrator wouldn't be 

6

applicable.  We do not think that the best reading of 

7

the arbitrator reference is that that would be a private 

8

person.  We think that 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I know  if I 

10

could  there's  the issues are pretty intertwined 

11

here, so I know it's a difficult thing to keep track of 

12

for you.  But if  if  and for us.  But if we think 

13

that the regulations have a regulations  not to load 

14

the question 

15
16
17

 MR. GANNON: 

The metrics and standards have 

a regulatory affect. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay.  Metrics and 

18

standards are regulations.  And if we think there is 

19

nothing in the statute that requires  well, I guess it 

20

doesn't  doesn't  doesn't really matter. 

21

 If that's the case, is the arbitrator an 

22

officer of the United States?  In other words, if he is 

23

the one that ends up issuing what we will hypothetically 

24

conclude are regulations, I assume he has to be an 

25

officer of the United States.

Alderson Reporting Company

17
1

 MR. GANNON: 

I  I think that would 

2

constitute significant governmental authority under 

3

Buckley against Valeo, and that would be 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, you know, I'm quite 

5

interested in the government's view of this case, and I 

6

hope you will calm me down. 

7

 The reason that I find it interesting is 

8

because it seems to me there are hundreds, maybe 

9

thousands of organizations that set standards for the 

10

industry.  And some of them operate under government 

11

memoranda or authority that ask them to do it, the most 

12

noted being ICANN which sets all the standards for the 

13

internet. 

14

 Now, it also seems to me very possible that 

15

a member of such an organization that fails to follow 

16

the standard could run afoul of other government rules 

17

or other agency rules or other laws, for example, by 

18

stalling the internet delivery of services and being 

19

delayed, and violating some FCC requirement.  And since 

20

I know that there are about 2 or 300 international 

21

organizations that we belong to, to do such things, I 

22

just wonder what the implications would be if you lose 

23

this case.  That is to say, if this Court held here that 

24

if a government, say, Congress, agency, Commerce 

25

Department, says to a group of private people set

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

standards, and then if they fail  or if they do so and 

2

a member fails to meet a standard, it runs afoul of a 

3

different rule, such as a rule that you have to have a 

4

certain speed on the Internet or some such thing.  Were 

5

we to hold that unconstitutional, I have a feeling 

6

that this is what I want assurance on that I'm wrong  that 

7

it would work havoc, possibly with the Internet, 

8

possibly with industry throughout the United States, I 

9

know not where, possibly in communications, possibly 

10
11

with the 200 or so organizations regulated by treaty. 
 Now, you've looked into this more than I 

12

and, therefore, I want you to calm me down and say no, 

13

this isn't a bigdeal case.  Don't worry about it. 

14
15
16

 MR. GANNON: 

I think it depends upon how 

broad the Court's ruling is.  I think 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no.  The ruling is 

17

narrow.  It just says the following.  It says, these are 

18

standards which equal legislation and as a result of 

19

these standards being legislated by this, I think, 

20

Quango or something, or whatever, by  by this 

21

particular entity, bad things happen to freight trains 

22

when they fail to meet the standards or something and 

23

they violate some other law and that's all 

24

unconstitutional. 

25

 MR. GANNON: 

And I frankly

 MR. GANNON:

 JUSTICE BREYER:

Going back to Carter v. 

Yes. 
We could go back to 

Lochner. 
 MR. GANNON: 

I don't think that  that 

7

Respondent is asking for a ruling of that nature.  And I 

8

think that the question here would be because of the 

9

role that the metrics and standards play in the STB 

10

investigation.  I think that would be the only way in 

11

which the Court would conclude that it is  is 

12

tantamount to regulations.  We don't believe that they 

13

have that effect.  We don't think that other standards 

14

that are conditions for application of  of the law out 

15

there in the world have necessarily the same effects 

16

under even Respondent's view of the case.  But I  and 

17

so I  I think that the one you want to get 

18

reassurances from is actually Respondent, that the 

19

nature of their challenge is  is narrower than that. 

20

But if I could return to the arbitrator

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 MR. GANNON: 

It  it would be the STB that 

appointed him. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 MR. GANNON:

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

11

But he's an 

arbitrator. 

8

10

Okay.  Then who 

He's an arbitrator. 
One of the parties 

to the arbitration. 
 MR. GANNON: 

I don't think the STB is a 

12

party to the arbitration.  I think that the  the two 

13

parties who have to issue the  their metrics and 

14

standards are Amtrak and the Federal Railroad 

15

Administration.  If they don't agree, then an 

16

arbitration  the arbitrator would be resolving a 

17

dispute not  the STB wouldn't be a party to that. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So if the STB 

19

doesn't like the arbitrator's decision, can the STB 

20

change it under the law? 

21

 MR. GANNON: 

I doubt it because it's 

22

supposed to be a binding arbitration.  But we think that 

23

from the beginning, this is yet another reason to 

24

construe the arbitrator as being somebody who is 

25

governmental, probably somebody who is actually at the

Alderson Reporting Company

STB. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't  I don't see how 

3

you can say he's an inferior officer.  He's supervised 

4

by nobody.  That's what we have held to be the  the 

5

touchstone of principal versus inferior.

 MR. GANNON: 

 to perform a limited task. 

He could be removed by the STB. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

A limited task is  is not 

13

the touchstone.  I mean, that's what we said in Morrison 

14

and we repudiated it in a later case, which said the 

15

touchstone of a  of a principal officer is whether 

16

that person is not subject to control by somebody else. 

17

And I don't see how this person is subject to any 

18

control in  in the task that he's assigned. 

19

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, in that sense, it's 

20

consistent with Morrison, and it is not consistent with 

21

what the Court said was sufficient to enter the question 

22

in Edmund, but did not say was necessary to answer the 

23

question in Edmund about there being review within the

Executive Branch of the decisions being made by the 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Let me  let me talk about 

2

regulatory effect.  As I understand it, once these 

3

what do you call them? 

4

 MR. GANNON: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The metrics and standards. 
Metrics and standards. 

6

Once they were issued, wow, the  the ontime record of 

7

Amtrak went way, way up.  So they had a very immediate 

8

and clear effect on the behavior of  of the parties. 

9

 Now, do you think that because the 

10

sentencing guidelines are now just advisory that we 

11

could have the sentencing guidelines issued by some 

12

private party that  that is not appointed pursuant to 

13

the requirements of the Constitution?  Because after 

14

all, they're just advisory.  Now, the reality is, they 

15

have a significant effect on  on the behavior of  of 

16

lower courts.  And I think it's the same thing here. 

17

There's a significant effect.  I don't know 

18

 MR. GANNON: 

I  I don't think that this is 

19

the same as the sentencing guidelines, the effect that 

20

it has on the judges, because those are advice to the 

21

judges.  Here, what the metrics and standards do is they 

22

satisfy conditions in the world when  when the Federal 

23

statute is going to be applicable.  It's in that sense, 

24

just like the Court contemplated in JW Hampton or indeed 

25

in cases like Currin v. Wallace and Rock Royal

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Cooperative, where the policy was established by the 

2

Federal government, the Secretary of Agriculture wanted 

3

to put a price order in effect or to say that a 

4

particular tobacco market would be subject to a Federal 

5

inspection regime and that could not occur until 

6

until there was approval from private entities. 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why did the record improve 

so  so rapidly and so promptly? 
 MR. GANNON: 

Because for the first time in 

10

decades there was a meaningful threat that there would 

11

be an enforcement proceeding, not to enforce the metrics 

12

and standards, but to enforce the statutory preference 

13

requirement, which is not challenged here, which was not 

14

written by Amtrak, and which would be enforced by the 

15

Surface Transportation Board in an independent 

16

adjudication in which they would take evidence from both 

17

sides and determine what the real story was.  There's 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can  can I go back to 

19

my question, okay?  Can the STB on its own start an 

20

investigation? 

21

 MR. GANNON: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 MR. GANNON: 

I 
If  if it gets 
That depends, Justice 

24

Sotomayor, on  on the answer to as I said is an 

25

unresolved question about whether the 80 percent ontime

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

performance trigger at the beginning of 24308(f)(1) 

2

is  is read as being confines to the ontime 

3

performance metrics and standards that were adopted 

4

under PRIIA or whether that can be a reference to a 

5

prePRIIA, ontime performance metric.  And so for 

6

decades, Amtrak, pursuant to ICC  originally pursuant 

7

to an ICC order used endpoint ontime performance 

8

metrics that looked very much like the ones that were 

9

ultimately adopted 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So doesn't this show 

11

something?  Actually, the sentencing guidelines are a 

12

pretty good example.  You do have the Model Penal Code. 

13

We have law professors telling judges what to do all the 

14

time.  We have judges who receive information in briefs. 

15

We had lots of guidelines promulgated by the states. 

16

There are all kinds of systems, and judges do use them, 

17

and some of them do have a practical effect and make a 

18

difference. 

19

 But once this Court starts down the road 

20

and it would be starting, because I am aware of no 

21

precedent  once we start down the road of saying 

22

Congress cannot tell even a private agency to go and 

23

make some standards, which we all know will be followed, 

24

once we start down that road there is no stopping place 

25

and, therefore, the measure has nothing to do with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

separation of powers.  It is exactly what Justices 

2

Cardozo, Hughes, Brandeis and Stone said in Carter Coal, 

3

the measure is the due process clause, and we're all off 

4

on something of a wild goose chase in this case.  That's 

5

what is suggested to me by the sentencing guideline 

6

analogy. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 MR. GANNON: 

Wow, I didn't mean that. 

To the extent that Justice 

10

Scalia also doesn't see a nondelegation problem in 

11

Carter Coal, then I  I take it that you are agreeing, but I 

12

think here that  that the criminal sentencing context 

13

may present different issues.  And I do think that the 

14

basic  the basic reasons why the due process issue is 

15

not one where we would have a problem is both because of 

16

the  what we think is the  the fact that this is 

17

relaxing the regulatory effect of  of the statutory 

18

preference.  And secondly, because those cases about 

19

bias in the due process context involve the entity 

20

that's actually doing the adjudication.  And here the 

21

analogy is that's the STB is acting as the Board of 

22

Optometrists in  in the Gibson v. Berryhill. 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I think it was the 

24

Respondent's brief in which they gave the hypothetical. 

25

Suppose that the government together with auto

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

manufacturer A made standards, but then auto 

2

manufacturers B and C had to follow them.  That seems 

3

wrong.  Why is this different? 

4

 MR. GANNON: 

I take the point that that 

5

seems wrong.  We don't think that this is the equivalent 

6

of regulating the automotive industry because Congress 

7

has put the regulation in place.  That's the statutory 

8

preference requirement.  This is something in which 

9

automobile manufacturer A would be, in advance, saying, 

10
11

I, automobile manufacturer 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose Congress put that 

12

in place?  Suppose Congress said, and once this is 

13

promulgated, all manufacturers have to obey it. 

14

 MR. GANNON: 

I think that that would 

15

without the federal agreement that we also have here, 

16

the federal railroad administration's contemporaneous 

17

agreement with the standards, that would present non 

18

delegation problems.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Dupree. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR. 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. DUPREE: 

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

please the Court: 

2

 The constitution does not permit Congress to 

3

create a corporation, deem it nongovernmental, and then 

4

launch it into the commercial sphere with a forprofit 

5

mandate and then vest it with regulatory authority over 

6

other companies in the same industry. 

7

 The text of the constitution places all 

8

legislative power in the Congress.  Although this Court 

9

has approved grants of rulemaking authority to executive 

10

branch agencies or judicial branch agencies, it has 

11

never approved a grant of regulatory power to a private 

12

corporation. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBERG: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What do you do about 
That's the big problem 

15

here, regulatory authority.  As far as I'm concerned, 

16

that's the big difficulty.  Why is this an exercise of 

17

regulatory authority when all it does is enable an 

18

investigation? 

19

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, Justice Scalia, I don't 

20

think it's quite correct to say all it does is enable an 

21

investigation.  For one thing, there is the provision in 

22

Section 207 (c) that requires the freight railroads to 

23

amend their contracts with Amtrak to the extent 

24

practicable to incorporate the metrics and standards. 

25

So there is a direct regulatory command on the freight

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

3
4

railroad. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but to the extent 

practicable, I mean, what does that mean? 
 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, unless it's a null set, 

5

Justice Kagan, it has to mean something.  And I don't 

6

think the government has ever said that the freight 

7

railroads

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So instead you want a 

rule that lets the STB investigate even when you have 
one failure to accommodate? 
 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, I'm not sure that's the 

12

rule we want, Justice Sotomayor, but at least that would 

13

have the merit 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you would prefer 

that? 
 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, it would at least have 

17

the merit of being constitutional.  In other words, the 

18

problem here is not necessarily the scope of the 

19

investigatory power.  It's the fact that Congress gave 

20

Amtrak the pen or coauthorship of the regulation. 

21

That's the constitutional vice here 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Just like the Department of 

23

Commerce acting under authority from Congress gave ICANN 

24

the power to write standards for the internet. 

25

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, and, Justice Breyer, let

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

me address your concern head on.  Because we've been 

2

litigating this case against the government for several 

3

years now and to my knowledge no party involved  the 

4

parties, the amici have foreseen the dire consequences 

5

that you honor posits 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm not saying it's a dire 

7

consequence.  By coincidence, I happen to be reading 

8

about the internet.  I'm trying to learn about 

9

something. 

10

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, Justice Breyer, I can 

11

make a few points in response.  One is that in the ICANN 

12

case that's not a situation where you have a company 

13

trying to regulate other competitors in the market. 

14

That is one difference.  Another difference is that a 

15

lot of these organizations tender their proposed 

16

standards to the agency for approval.  So at the end of 

17

the day, it's the agency that has the final say in many 

18

cases.  That's this model that Congress enacted. 

19

 And here, Congress plainly could have given 

20

Amtrak an advisory role, Section 207 (a) gives all sorts 

21

of entities and participants with a stake in these rules 

22

an advisory role.  And there is absolutely no reason 

23

that Congress could not easily have drafted that statute 

24

to give Amtrak an advisory role. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if the government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

agency, the FRA, it says, you know, what Amtrak 

2

proposes, the government's assent is essential to this 

3

scheme, right? 

4

 MR. DUPREE: 

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.  But 

5

I think the key point here is that Amtrak's assent is 

6

also essential.  So, to be sure, the government could 

7

halt a regulation that Amtrak wanted to put in effect, but the 

8

constitutional advice here is that Amtrak has the same 

9

power.  It could prevent the government from putting the 

10

government's preferred regulation in place.  And that's 

11

giving too much power to a private entity to be able to 

12

dictate to the federal government what regulations will 

13

be issued 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You don't have to answer 

15

this question, but have you thought through what this 

16

means  what I think is called the Baal conference 

17

where you have groups of regulators and banks meeting 

18

together to determine what they are going to do about 

19

interest rates, money supplied, et cetera.  You have 

20

not, is the answer, and I don't know enough about it, so 

21

skip it. 

22

 MR. DUPREE: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Very good. 
Well, but then, how do 

24

you  do you say that we were just plain wrong when we 

25

let the tobacco industry and milk producers veto

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

regulations in our two prior cases Currin and Rock 

2

Royal? 

3

 MR. DUPREE: 

Yes, the difference in those 

4

cases, Justice Sotomayor, is that in those cases it was 

5

a federal government that drafted the regulation.  And 

6

what happened at that point was that Congress gave the 

7

industry  or in those cases a super majority of the 

8

industry the power to vote whether to subject themselves 

9

to the regulation.  And the distinction there is between 

10

the government exercising the legislative authority and 

11

the private company determining when that 

12

authority becomes effective.  That's 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's  that line is 

14

too thin for me.  Because consent to me means it has to 

15

satisfy both parties.  And that's no different than a 

16

veto.  This is the STB saying, this satisfies us, this 

17

is what we would like to do.  Amtrak is this  are you 

18

willing to be regulated, just like the tobacco produce 

19

 the tobacco industry and the milk producers. 

20

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, for one thing my clients, 

21

the regulated parties, were not given a say in this.  So 

22

to say Amtrak, is this what you want 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's the due process. 

That's the due process. 
 MR. DUPREE: 

Fair enough.  Then, with regard

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1
2

to Your Honor's point 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And that's fair enough 

3

by the way.  That's an issue that's fair enough.  But 

4

and subject to more talk.  But I'm not quite sure why 

5

this becomes 

6

 MR. DUPREE: 

With regard to Your Honor's 

7

earlier point about that being a thin line, I understand 

8

that but at the same time that is the line, the precise 

9

line that this Court explicitly drew both in Curran and 

10

in J.W. Hampton where it said that allowing this vote of 

11

the regulated parties, that doesn't amount to 

12

legislative action.  Agreed it may be a fine line but it 

13

is the line that this Court has reverted to time and 

14

again. 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't know what they 

16

meant because they were subjecting themselves to 

17

standards. 

18

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, and I would simply go 

19

back to our point that we never had a vote in this 

20

process. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What do you make of the 

22

provision to which you referred earlier that says that 

23

the metrics and standards shall be incorporated into the 

24

operating agreements to the greatest extent practicable 

25

or to the extent practicable.  If a particular railroad

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

took the position that it will never agree to the 

2

incorporation of the metrics and standards into an 

3

operating agreement, is there anything that the federal 

4

government could do? 

5

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, Justice Alito, I think in 

6

that situation what would likely happen if Amtrak and 

7

the freight railroad could not reach agreement and 

8

therefore there was no agreement on the terms of the 

9

operating agreement, is that the Surface Transportation 

10

Board ultimately would be called upon to step in and 

11

essentially dictate terms or help the parties reach 

12

terms and proscribe the terms of the operating 

13

agreement.  And I think in that situation  again, it 

14

hasn't yet arisen but it would not surprise me in the 

15

slightest if Amtrak's argument at that point to the 

16

Surface Transportation Board was pointing to the 

17

language of 207 (c) and saying, this freight railroad is 

18

under a statutory mandate that it shall amend its 

19

agreements to the extent practicable.  And nothing in 

20

the statute suggests that the determination as to 

21

practicability is something that falls within the 

22

exclusive jurisdiction of the freight railroads.  The 

23

statutory language doesn't suggest that.  If this Court 

24

were to hold that, I certainly wouldn't quarrel with it, 

25

but I'm not quite sure the statutory language gets you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1
2

there. 
 I think one fundamental flaw with the 

3

statute which we've not yet touched on, an additional 

4

flaw, is the problem of accountability.  That, of 

5

course, is the concern that has animated this Court's 

6

non delegation and due process jurisprudence.  And here 

7

you have a situation where Congress, the President and 

8

Amtrak itself have repeatedly declared to the public in 

9

explicit terms that Amtrak is not the government. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you think that's 

11

dispositive?  Because I've always thought that the 

12

labels that Congress decides to put on these things is 

13

not of particular relevance. 

14

 MR. DUPREE: 

I'm not so sure I would go so 

15

far as to say it's dispositive, Justice Kagan.  But I do 

16

think it's highly relevant.  I think when this Court has 

17

spoken about transparency and accountability in the 

18

legislative process, what it's been talking about is the 

19

ability of the public to look at a regulation or a law 

20

and make a judgment as to where to assign blame.  And 

21

when you have all parties involved assuring the public 

22

that Amtrak is not a government actor, I think the 

23

public is entitled to take the President and the 

24

Congress at their word and say that this is not the 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And not look at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

animal as it exists?  Lebron said that the government 

2

exerts control over Amtrak as a policy maker.  This 

3

Amtrak, you will agree, is not like a private 

4

corporation.  It's  there's a great deal of federal 

5

involvement in Amtrak, right? 

6

 MR. DUPREE: 

I agree.  I agree.  But I think 

7

what resolves this case is the fact that Amtrak operates 

8

under a statutory mandate to conduct its affairs as 

9

though it were a nongovernmental entity and a 

10
11

forprofit corporation.  In fact, in the briefing 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, the post office is 

12

supposed to be a forprofit corporation, too, to the 

13

same extent, right? 

14

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, yes, Justice Kagan, keep 

15

in mind the post office is expressly created as a 

16

federal entity, it's in our Constitution and in Federal 

17

statutory law it says the post office is an agency or an 

18

entity within the executive branch. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But then that all goes back 

20

to labels.  I mean, I guess I'm just wondering what 

21

about Amtrak is not governmental other than the label. 

22

 MR. DUPREE: 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well 
Subject to the policy 

24

control of Congress, which Congress exercises pretty 

25

much on a routine basis, it's entirely funded by

Congress, all the members of the board are appointed by 

2

the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, 

3

save the  save one. 

4

 You know, I guess I'm just wondering other 

5

than this label, what suggests that this is not the 

6

government? 

7

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, first, I would take issue 

8

with just the label.  In other words, the organic 

9

statute of Amtrak in the US Code says it is not the 

10

government.  So it may be a little more than just a 

11

label. 

12

 But taking Your Honor's point, I think what 

13

makes Amtrak not the government for nondelegation 

14

purposes is that Amtrak's officers and employees are not 

15

Federal employees, they don't take an oath of office and 

16

they are constrained by various financial incentives and 

17

statutory mandates to operate Amtrak not in the common 

18

good, not as a neutral, disinterested regulator would, 

19

but as a forprofit commercial actor. 

20

 That's actually the very point that Amtrak 

21

made to this Court in its Lebron brief where it said 

22

keep in mind, we are not neutral government regulators, 

23

we are hungry capitalists.  That's how we run Amtrak. 

24

We have a 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  We rejected that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1
2

argument. 
 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, it rejected the ultimate 

3

constitutional conclusion for purposes of the First 

4

Amendment claim, but I don't think this Court took issue 

5

with the fact that Amtrak's officers and directors have 

6

said from day one very publicly that we don't govern in 

7

any sense.  We are not neutral, disinterested 

8

regulators.  We are a forprofit business.  And that's 

9

what makes this case different, Justice Kagan. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So for  I mean, for that 

11

purpose, what difference does it make whether it's a 

12

governmental entity or not, so long as it is operating 

13

on a forprofit basis and is giving  is given the last 

14

word on some regulatory matters that disadvantage its 

15

competitors, there's a violation of due process.  I  I 

16

don't see how it makes any difference whether you call 

17

it governmental or not. 

18

 MR. DUPREE: 

Justice Scalia, I certainly 

19

agree a hundred percent with you on the due process 

20

point.  I think that whether it is government or 

21

nongovernmental may play a role if this Court were to 

22

approach this case through the lens of nondelegation, 

23

but as far as due process goes, Your Honor is exactly 

24

correct.  No matter what we call Amtrak, the question 

25

ultimately at the end of the day is whether this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

Federallychartered corporation with all of the various 

2

financial incentives, statutory mandates and commands, 

3

can exercise regulatory power over other commercial 

4

actors in the marketplace. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The due process question 

6

wasn't  the due process question wasn't aired below at 

7

all; isn't that so? 

8
9

 MR. DUPREE: 

It was aired below, Justice 

Ginsburg.  We have fully briefed due process at every 

10

stage of this case, as has the government.  The district 

11

court resolved it on the merits and the D.C. Circuit 

12

didn't need to reach it because it resolved it on 

13

nondelegation grounds, but it did drop a footnote and 

14

said, nondelegation and due process are so closely 

15

intertwined in this context and, frankly, we're not 

16

sure, as Justice Scalia suggested, whether ultimately it 

17

would make a difference.  So that's why I took the 

18

nondelegation route.  But there's no question that due 

19

process is fully briefed, fully teed up for this Court's 

20

review. 

21
22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And not decided by the 

D.C. Circuit. 

23

 MR. DUPREE: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

 MR. DUPREE: 

I beg your pardon? 
And not decided 
That's correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 because the D.C. 

Circuit went on a delegation. 
 MR. DUPREE: 

That's correct.  But as I said, 

4

they said in the footnote, Footnote 3 toward the 

5

beginning of the opinion, that they didn't see much of a 

6

difference in this context because Carter Coal speaks 

7

both to nondelegation and due process and it did an 

8

analysis under Carter Coal. 

9

 So regardless if this Court thinks that 

10

Carter Coal is more properly characterized as 

11

nondelegation of due process, the merits of that 

12

question are squarely before this Court. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So are you attacking the 

14

statute that says that competitors have to accommodate 

15

Amtrak?  Is that what you're saying is the due process 

16

violation? 

17

 MR. DUPREE: 

It's not, Justice Sotomayor. 

18

The statute that we're attacking is Section 207 of 

19

PRIIA. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But the  but the 

21

investigation is only going to determine whether you 

22

violated the statute's failure to accommodate Amtrak. 

23

 MR. DUPREE: 

I don't think that's quite 

24

right, Your Honor.  In other words, the  a necessary 

25

predicate for liability is not just violation of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

preference statute, but also a violation of the metrics 

2

and standards.  The government needs to prove both.  It 

3

needs to prove violation of the metrics and standards 

4

and violation of the preference requirement. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can the government  what 

6

is the due process violation?  That is to say, if the 

7

Department of Energy under delegated authority says that 

8

the makers of the bulbs that are energy efficient must 

9

use, and they may choose any one of the five methods 

10

that produces green light or white light or whatever it 

11

is, and they are  they are to choose the method, and 

12

that's just it.  Now, that puts at a disadvantage those 

13

competitors who do not use energyefficient bulbs.  Is 

14

that a violation of due process? 

15

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, if I'm understanding Your 

16

Honor's hypothetical, it doesn't sound like it because 

17

you have a situation where it's the government that's 

18

prescribing the regulations. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No.  It gives them 

20

considerable leeway as to make subsidiary decisions.  I 

21

was trying to make it realistic.  They make subsidiary 

22

decisions as to how they go about fulfilling the basic 

23

energy efficiency mandate. 

24
25

 MR. DUPREE: 

Right.  It  it  the way 

Your Honor described that 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1
2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I just described it 

now. 

3

 MR. DUPREE: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
They have broad authority, 

5

but they have to meet certain energyefficient mandates 

6

and they can prescribe standards and so forth that will 

7

allow them to do it.  Does that violate due process 

8

because it hurts the manufacturers of ordinary energy 

9

bulbs? 

10

 MR. DUPREE: 

If  when you say "prescribe 

11

standards," it would pose a problem if the standards 

12

they're prescribing apply to others in the industry.  If 

13

the way Your Honor posited it originally, it sounded as 

14

though Congress was essentially giving 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It applies.  They don't 

16

have to meet it.  What happens is it gives them an 

17

advantage the way they choose over nonenergy efficient 

18

bulbs. 

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

 MR. DUPREE: 

That doesn't sound like a due 

process violation. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Then what is your violation 

here?  I'm trying to figure out what your violation 
 MR. DUPREE: 

The violation here is that 

Congress has given Amtrak the pen. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The what?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1
2
3
4

 MR. DUPREE: 

The pen.  To write the Federal 

regulations. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You have to posit that the 

energy department manufactures bulbs. 

5

 MR. DUPREE: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No. 
And that it keeps the 

7

profit from the bulbs on its own.  It doesn't have to go 

8

deposit it in the treasury.  So the  so the  it is a 

9

profitmaking entity and it prescribes standards, as 

10

Justice Breyer suggested, that harms other people.  That 

11

would be a parallel to this. 

12

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well  and if that's the 

13

situation where the government is both acting in the 

14

marketplace as a commercial actor and as a regulator of 

15

the industry, that's a problem. 

16

 But what makes this case, I think, so 

17

difficult is that being a commercial forprofit actor is 

18

fundamentally incompatible with the notion of being a 

19

disinterested government regulator.  That's because the 

20

essence of a 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's what I was  I'm 

22

trying to get at  I started with the statement, I 

23

think, that due process  your argument  it didn't 

24

matter whether you called them private or public; am I 

25

right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

 MR. DUPREE: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right. 
Okay.  Now, let's imagine 

3

they're just a company, not the Department of Energy. 

4

The Department of Energy has a broad energy efficient 

5

standard.  It delegates to the people who make that kind 

6

of bulb all kinds of minor interstitial standards to 

7

make.  They make them.  They hurt the energy bulbs, the 

8

ordinary energy bulbs.  Is that a violation of due 

9

process?  If so, why?  If not, how is yours different? 

10

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, that  I think that 

11

might be a violation of due process because in that 

12

situation what happens is that the Department of Energy 

13

is giving authority to private corporations to set 

14

rules, standards that govern the conduct of other 

15

private corporations. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

private organizations. 

18

 MR. DUPREE: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It will hurt the other 

Right. 
My reaction was the way you 

20

deal with that normally is the statute would be 

21

interpreted not to give them the authority to write 

22

anticompetitive regulations and you'd attack it under 

23

the antitrust laws.  There may be other ways to do it. 

24

I've never heard of an example where the due process 

25

problem really was a constitutional problem under due

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1
2

process. 
 Now  now, maybe there's some cases I've 

3

overlooked.  The only one coming close, it seemed to me, 

4

is Carter v. Carter Coal, which I always put in the same 

5

box as Lochner.  Now  now, are we supposed to 

6

resurrect that?  Is there other authority for that 

7

proposition?  What is it? 

8
9

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, Justice Breyer, I do 

believe that this Court on multiple occasions subsequent 

10

to the Lochner era has reaffirmed the core holding of 

11

Carter Coal about delegations to private parties are 

12

forbidden.  This Court said that in Mistretta.  A number 

13

of justices have said in separate opinions that that 

14

holding remains 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But your due process, I 

16

want some authority for your due process point on the 

17

private agencies. 

18

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, our  the foundational 

19

case we have for due process in this context is Carter 

20

Coal.  Absolutely.  But again, I simply take issue with 

21

Your Honor's suggestion that it's a remnant of the 

22

Lochner era.  I think it retains its vitality today as 

23

many subsequent opinions of this Court have recognized. 

24
25

 Let me address Mr. Gannon's point very 
briefly, if I may, on the notion that it was somehow the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

preference requirement that was driving the dramatic 

2

change in Amtrak's performance.  The preference 

3

requirement was enacted in the early 1970s.  So Mr. 

4

Gannon is unable to explain why this magical change 

5

didn't occur until the metrics and standards came into 

6

effect. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, he said the metrics 

8

and standards for the first time made it realistic that 

9

there would be enforcement of that requirement. 

10

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, first, I would say if 

11

that's true, that, to me, strikes me as a pretty plain 

12

regulatory effect in that the metrics and standards are 

13

on the books and the freight railroads know that they 

14

now need to comply or they're going to face enforcement 

15

actions.  The government 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  I think  I think you 

17

can allow a private party to bring an enforcement 

18

action. 

19
20
21

 MR. DUPREE: 

You can allow a private 

party 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, even if they just 

22

said an enforcement action shall be commenced if Amtrak 

23

requests it.  I think that would be perfectly 

24

constitutional. 

25

 MR. DUPREE: 

I agree, Justice Scalia, but at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

the same time the problem here is that Congress has 

2

given Amtrak the power to define the terms and to draft 

3

the regulations in which it may bring an enforcement 

4

action.  If 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dupree, I mean, one way 

6

to look at this on the delegation question, not on the 

7

due process question but on the delegation question, is 

8

that there is government all over this at every step, 

9

that there is all kinds of supervision of Amtrak itself, 

10

no matter what Amtrak does that; but with respect to the 

11

metrics and standards, particularly, that there is no 

12

way Amtrak is actually going to be able to get anything 

13

unless the FRA comes aboard, and that furthermore, that 

14

even those metrics and standards are useless unless the 

15

Surface Transportation Board decides to enforce the 

16

preference requirement. 

17

 So there is, like, no place at which a 

18

private actor can do something itself in this scheme, it 

19

would seem to me. 

20

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, I  I take the point 

21

that the FRA is involved in the development of the 

22

standards, but I don't think it follows from  from 

23

that premise to say that Congress can give a private 

24

company and the Federal government joint ownership of 

25

the pen in drafting the regulations.  That's the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1
2

problem. 
 And with regard to the issue of government 

3

control over Amtrak, the government conceded in the D.C. 

4

Circuit that it did not control Amtrak on a daytoday 

5

basis and that includes, for present purposes, the 

6

rulemaking at issue.  In fact, Congress certainly did 

7

not view the Federal government as controlling Amtrak in 

8

the rulemaking, because if it did, it would not have 

9

inserted the arbitration provision. 

10

 Congress clearly understood that in the 

11

context of this rulemaking, the Federal government did 

12

not control Amtrak.  That is why the arbitration 

13

provision is in there. 

14
15

 Unless there are further questions, we'll 
ask that the judgment below be affirmed. 

16

24

for the Federal government.  The Federal government's 

25

fingerprints are all over not just Amtrak but also the

them. 

3

 On the Amtrak side here, the metrics and 

4

standards were approved by Amtrak's president who is 

5

somebody who is appointed by the eight presidential 

6

appointees and serves at their pleasure.  And so the 

7

notion that this is just somebody down in the bowels

10

misguided.

18

does require the contracts to be incorporated to the 

19

extent practicable.  We have actually said in our brief 

20

that we think that that is something that is largely due 

21

to negotiation between the parties.  There are certain 

22

aspects of the metrics and standards that it would not 

23

make sense to incorporate in the contracts, and what the

which would include the requirement that, to the extent

practicable, the standards set forth by Amtrak be

12

 MR. GANNON: 

But we  we don't think that 

13

that requires they be  they are not things that would 

14

be binding on the freight railroads.  The statute 

15

provides that there needs to be an incentive payment. 

16

For instance, the statute provides that there needs to 

17

be an incentive payment in the contracts.  But it 

18

doesn't mean that that  that the incentive payment now 

19

has to correspond precisely to what the metrics and 

20

standards are.  That is something that's subject to 

21

negotiation between the parties, and 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, as  as your friend 

23

said, to the extent practicable, unless the whole thing

is nugatory, certainly does not wash out the whole 

25

provision.

 MR. GANNON: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3
4

Well, I think that 
It must have some bite. 

What bite does it have? 
 MR. GANNON: 

I think it was to encourage the 

5

parties to ensure that they are now collecting data in 

6

systematic ways, that they can nationalize things, 

7

that  that they now measure things in the same 

8

fashion, they use minutes instead of seconds or 

9

whatever, and also that there are some parts of the 

10

metrics and standards that wouldn't make sense to go in 

11

the contracts at all, things that have to do with 

12

customer service surveys about  satisfaction surveys 

13

about the cleanliness of the cars.  And so  and 

14

ultimately even the canon of constitutional avoidance 

15

could be used to prevent that from doing the work that 

16

would  that would make it regulatory in this context 

17

if that were to make it a problem here. 

18

 I think that it's also the case that 

19

Mr. Dupree is talking about Amtrak as a competitor of 

20

the freight railroads, and we think that that's the 

21

wrong analogy, that Amtrak is effectively like a 

22

customer of a common carrier that is entitled to get 

23

services from the railroads at a particular rate.  And 

24

that's the way it's always been.  And under Respondent's 

25

approach, there would be both nondelegation problems and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

due process problems, apparently, with the type of thing 

2

that occurred in Boston against Maine, where this Court 

3

held that Amtrak was able to initiate a condemnation 

4

proceeding for rail property before the ICC, and its 

5

determination that it needed that particular property 

6

had a strong presumption that it was going to be true 

7

and governing in that proceeding.  This Court held that 

8

that was not an impermissible delegation of eminent 

9

domain authority, because the ICC made the ultimate 

10

determination there, notwithstanding the fact that 

11

Amtrak had to trigger the proceeding and Amtrak's 

12

decision to do so created a statutory presumption that 

13

there would be need. 

14

 I think that Mr. Dupree also is concerned 

15

about the need for Amtrak's consent here.  This goes 

16

back to the very  first argument that we have in our 

17

brief that under cases like Currin and Rock Royal 

18

Cooperative, the fact that the government needed to 

19

secure the consent of Amtrak is not something that makes 

20

that a delegation outside the government.  Even though 

21

they had the pen along the way, the veto power is what 

22

is most important, and we think it's especially easy to 

23

get there in the context of an entity like Amtrak which 

24

is, at worst, for us quasiprivate rather than entirely 

25

private.

 And we think if you take that into account

here, also the limited effect that the metrics and

standards have, that this is not a nondelegation

problem for any of the three problems the court of
