ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE WINFREE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. WINFREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Since 2009, when Maryland began to collect

12

DNA samples from arrestees charged with violent crimes

13

and burglary, there have been 225 matches, 75

14

prosecutions, and 42 convictions, including that of

15

Respondent King.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's really good.

17

I'll bet you, if you conducted a lot of unreasonable

18

searches and seizures, you'd get more convictions, too.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21
22

That proves absolutely

nothing.
MS. WINFREE:

Well, I think, Justice Scalia,

23

it does, in fact, point out the fact that -- that the

24

statute is working, and, in the State's view, the Act is

25

constitutional.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So that's its purpose, to

2

enable you to identify future criminals -- the

3

perpetrators of future crimes?

4

it?

5

the -- in the statute. 


That's the purpose of

I thought that that wasn't the purpose set forth in

6

MS. WINFREE:

No, not -- not just to 


7

identify people -- the purpose of the statute is to 


8

enable the State to identify perpetrators of serious 


9

crimes and -- and to use the information to make bail 


10

determinations for people who are validly in their

11

custody.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I'm having a hard

13

time understanding the bail argument because, in my

14

time, most bail decisions were made at the time of

15

arrest.

16

results didn't come up until August.

17

MS. WINFREE:

And, here, the arrest was in April, and the

That's true,

Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

detained anyway, correct?

21

MS. WINFREE:

He was detained anyway.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and there might

23

be a case where someone's gotten out, but it would be

24

the rare case.

25

MS. WINFREE:

Well -4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's -- you don't use it

2

routinely for the bail determination.

3

MS. WINFREE:

At this point, you're

4

absolutely correct, Justice Sotomayor.

5

routinely for a couple of reasons.

6

Mr. King's case, there has been, in the past, a more 


7

substantial delay in getting those results back. 


For one, as in 


Our -- our lab now is getting results 


8
9

We don't use it

between 11 and 17 days.

Now, that, of course --


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

Well, that doesn't

11

include the time to collect the sample, send it to you,

12

or the time to do the match.

13

rapid, correct?

14

MS. WINFREE:

It's just to do the genome

No, that's for the whole ­-

15

that's for the whole process, Justice Sotomayor.

16

for getting the sample and getting it into the system,

17

the DNA profile, and getting the match back.

18

what we're being told.

19

It's

That's

It's from 11 to 17 days.

Now, of course, that wouldn't be timely for

20

that first bail determination, but the State, under

21

Maryland's procedure, certainly has the ability to go

22

back to -- to the judge and ask that sentence -- or

23

that -- I'm sorry -- that bail determination to be

24

modified.

In California's amicus brief, which was

2

joined by the 49 other States and D.C. and Puerto Rico,

3

they actually do cite two particular examples where --

4

where two people, Castillo and Shamblin, were arrested.

5

One was arrested on a credit card charge and

6

another on a drug charge.

Mr. Castillo was actually

7

released on his -- on OR, and, when his sample was

8

matched, it came back to a -- an unsolved rape and

9

sodomy, and his OR was revoked.

10

In Mr. Shamblin's case, he was granted

11

diversion because his drug charge was a relatively

12

low-level offense and, when the match came back, it --

13

it tied him to a rape and murder.

14

revoked, and he's currently pending charge -- pending

15

trial on both of those charges.

16

His diversion was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your -- your

17

procedure limits the collection to certain violent

18

offenses, right?

19

MS. WINFREE:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

would not be so limited, would it?

22

there's no reason you couldn't undertake this procedure

23

with respect to anybody pulled over for a traffic

24

violation?

25

MS. WINFREE:

It does, Mr. Chief Justice.
But your argument
Under your theory,

Well, in Maryland, it's not

2

and burglaries.

someone is physically taken into custody.

Actually, we don't collect DNA unless

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I understand.

6

But there's no reason you couldn't, right?

it's not that hard.

Breathalyzer tests, they can also take a Q-tip or

9

whatever and get a DNA sample, right?

Police officers who give

MS. WINFREE:

10

I gather

Well, what I would say to that

11

is that, with respect to a traffic stop, this Court

12

said, in Berkemer, that a motorist has an expectation

13

that a traffic stop is going to be relatively brief and

14

temporary, that he or she will be given a citation and

15

sent on their way.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how long does

17

it take to -- to undergo the procedure?

18

say, ah, and then -- you know.

19

MS. WINFREE:

You know, you

It doesn't take long, but what

20

I was suggesting is that, because of the nature of a

21

traffic stop, this Court might well decide that a

22

motorist has a reasonable expectation of privacy not

23

to --

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about a Terry stop?

A Terry stop?
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

MS. WINFREE:

In a Terry -- well, this

Court, I guess we would look at two -- one case in

particular, this Court's case -- decision in Hayes

4

v. Florida.

5

into custody, so his -- he was not arrested, but taken

6

into custody for -- to get his fingerprints, and this

7

Court held that that was not -- that was not

8

constitutional.

9

That involved a defendant who was taken

But the Court further said that there could

10

be a circumstance in a Terry stop, if the officer had

11

reasonable suspicion to believe that -- that the

12

individual was --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But these -- these are

14

all cases -- I mean, the dominant use is to solve what

15

they call cold -- cold cases, and you gave one example.

16

This case is another.

17

right?

18

A rape committed 6 years before,

And there was no reasonable suspicion, there

19

was no -- nothing, right?

And the suspicion comes up

20

only because the DNA sample comes back as a match.

21

is it the -- this is a very reliable tool, but it's not

22

based on any kind of suspicion of the individual who's

23

being subjected to it, right?

So

24

MS. WINFREE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

25

And, if I could go back to your question
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about the Terry stop, the cornerstone of our -- and I do

2

believe that this Court could -- could -- who knows how

3

this Court would come out in that situation, but I

4

think, in terms of our argument, the corner --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MS. WINFREE:

I know.

Well, happily, we don't have

8

to decide that one today.

But what -- what I -- the

9

cornerstone of our argument is that when an individual

10

is taken into custody, an individual is arrested on a

11

probable cause -- a probable cause arrest, that person,

12

by virtue of being in that class of individuals whose

13

conduct has led the police to arrest him on -- based on

14

probable cause, surrenders a substantial amount of

15

liberty and privacy.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Ms. Winfree, that can't

17

be quite right, can it?

I mean, such a person -- assume

18

you've been arrested for something, the State doesn't

19

have the right to go search your house for evidence of

20

unrelated crimes; isn't -- isn't that correct?

21

MS. WINFREE:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

That's correct, Justice Kagan.
It doesn't have the right to

go search your car for evidence of unrelated crimes.

24

MS. WINFREE:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct.
Just because you've been
9


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

arrested doesn't mean that you lose the privacy

2

expectations and things you have that aren't related to

3

the offense that you've been arrested for.

4

MS. WINFREE:

That's correct, but what we're

5

seizing here is not evidence of crime.

6

information related to that person's DNA profile.

7

26 numbers --

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What it is, is
Those

Well -- and if there were a

real identification purpose for this, then I understand

10

that argument.

11

which is the way you started, then it's just like

12

searching your house, to see what's in your house that

13

could help to solve a cold case.

14

But, if it's just to solve cold cases,

MS. WINFREE:

Well, I would say there's a

15

very real distinction between the police generally

16

rummaging in your home to look for evidence that might

17

relate to your personal papers and your thoughts.

18

a very real difference there than swabbing the inside of

19

an arrestee's cheek to determine what that person's

20

CODIS DNA profile is.

21
22

It's

It's looking only at 26 numbers that tell us
nothing more about that individual.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but, if that's what

24

you're basing it on, then you're not basing it on an

25

arrestee.

I mean, then the Chief Justice is right, it
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could be any arrestee, no matter how minor the offense.

2

It could be just any old person in the street.

3
4
5

Why don't we do this for everybody who comes
in for a driver's license because it's very effective?
MS. WINFREE:

I think the difference there

6

is these people are lawfully in custody, having been

7

arrested based on probable cause, and that --

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
see two lines of cases, okay?

All right.

So, now, I

The Fourth Amendment,

10

which says you can't do a search without a warrant and

11

probable cause, and Samson, and most of your brief

12

argument was based on Samson.

13

As I read Samson, it was the special

14

relationship between the parolee or the probationary

15

person, that line of cases, and the assumption being

16

that they're out in the world, I think, by the largesse

17

of the State.

18

home, just as it would their cell, essentially.

19

So the State has a right to search their

Why is that true for an arrestee?

What

20

about -- what creates this special relationship that

21

permits you to intrude, search their home, search their

22

car, search their person, to solve other cases?

23

MS. WINFREE:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Well -Because you're going to

have to tell me why searching their person is different
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

than searching their home or car.

2

MS. WINFREE:

Well, if I could start at the

3

back end of your question, Justice Sotomayor, we're not

4

suggesting -- and this statute doesn't permit the State

5

or police to search an arrestee's home or his person

6

beyond -- beyond simply swabbing the cheek for the DNA.

7

Now, in terms of the -- the individual's

8

relationship to the State, an arrestee is not that

9

dissimilar.

There is, obviously, a range of -- of

10

relationships with the State.

11

on the street, ordinary citizens are at one end, people

12

who are imprisoned upon conviction are at the other end.

13

Those of us who are out

And -- but, in terms of when an arrestee is

14

physically in custody, he has a reduced expectation of

15

privacy, and that's what makes, in our view, it makes

16

this case more similar.

17

It's -- there's no -- there's no one case in this

18

Court's jurisprudence that's exactly like this.

19

To be sure, this is not Samson.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's no other case,

20

but Samson, in that line that permits searches on this

21

balancing.

22

MS. WINFREE:

Well --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what I want to know

24

is what's the legal theory now?

How far do we let the

25

State go each time it has some form of custody over you,
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in schools, in workplaces, wherever else the State has

2

control over your person?

3

MS. WINFREE:

Well, those are different

4

situations, Justice Sotomayor.

5

that -- that the police could swab a student for -- for

6

a DNA sample.

7

people who, by their conduct, have -- have been arrested

8

based on probable cause.

9

We're not suggesting

We're talking about a special class of

10

specific quick question?

11

MS. WINFREE:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I ask you a particular

Yes, Justice Breyer.
As I read this, this

concerns people arrested for a felony, a crime of

14

violence, attempted crime of violence, burglary, or

15

attempted burglary.

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

about people who are driving cars and traffic stops and

19

all these other things?

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

The only thing we have to

22

decide is whether a person, where there's probable cause

to arrest a person for those four crimes, their

14

MR. DREEBEN:

That is certainly correct,

15

Chief Justice Roberts, and the reason for that is going

16

into the house will expose a substantial number of

highly private things to the view of the State.

a DNA sample is not of that character.

19

like taking a fingerprint.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Taking

It is far more

Well, that -- this

is a factual question.

I understand your emphasis on

Does the sample that you retain, can it be

the law says we only look at these 13, but we have this

3

saliva, we want to look at all sorts of other stuff.

4

In other words, saying, well,

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, by law, the -- the

government, under CODIS, and the States cannot look at

anything except identification information.

7

contains the entire genome.

8

at as a matter of law.

9

The sample

The sample cannot be looked

And I think it's critical to this case to --

10

for the Court to understand that, if the Court

11

concludes, as is probably correct, that the individual

12

will retain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the

13

genomic material that does not reveal identity, then

14

additional Fourth Amendment scrutiny would be required

15

before the government could make use of the rest of the

16

genome.

17

Here, it's making use of an identity

18

indicator that is highly similar to fingerprints with

19

one significant difference:

It is far more accurate.

20

When Respondent committed his rape --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Dreeben, is it

22

really?

Because, if this were like fingerprints, I

23

think that you would have a quite good case.

24

I've been reading about this, it -- it seems as though

25

the technology is not the same as the fingerprint
16

Alderson Reporting Company

But, as

Official

technology; and, because the technology is different, it

2

is used differently.

3

Fingerprints, you go in, you put in a

4

fingerprint, there is identifying information that comes

5

back to you in 5 minutes, right?

6

This, you put in something, and Ms. Winfree

7

said was 11 to 17 days, in this case, it's four months,

8

and it doesn't seem to be used because the technology

9

doesn't allow it to be used as the kind of routine

10

identifier that fingerprints does.

11

So am I wrong about that?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

You are not wrong, Justice

13

Kagan, but the future is very close to where there will

14

be rapid DNA analyzers that are devices that can analyze

15

and produce the identification material in -- in the DNA

16

within 90 minutes.

17

put them at the booking station, so that DNA can be

18

taken, and, within 90 minutes, that information is

19

known.

And the design of this program is to

In that circumstance, it will be highly

21

relevant to the immediate release/custody decision,

22

which it already can play a role in --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

That -- that part is

24

surprising.

Then do you think the States are wrong?

identification database samples have been processed in

as few as 2 days in California and -- although around

process this in 2 days, not 9 days.

The swab is taken,

of crime scene DNA, is that correct?

Because that suggests that,

some crimes, but not as an identification device because

be comparing it to the known offender database, not to

MR. DREEBEN:

I agree with that, and I think

that, in California, the brief for the States indicates
20

that many States do that, and California itself uses it

2

to resolve discrepancies in identity when a fingerprint

comes back and it returns to multiple names, or the

identification.

California cross-checks, so it does

And, as I suggested, with the advent of

8

rapid DNA, it's not that it is unconstitutional before

9

rapid DNA, but rapid DNA will permit DNA identification

10

to replace fingerprint identification because it's far

11

more accurate, and it has far more utility in the

12

secondary purpose of fingerprints, which is to match

13

them to latent prints and solve crimes.

14

And this is highly relevant to both of the

15

major purposes for taking DNA, crime solution and

facilitating the release/custody determination.

State because, after all, both Samson and Knights were

cases in which the individual was still under State

what we -- we have been presented with in the briefs and

what we have heard this morning -- and, by the way, I

think this is perhaps the most important criminal

procedure case that this Court has heard in decades.

If it was

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Alito, we think that

3

fingerprinting is distinguishable on three grounds.

4

First of all, as a practical matter, an individual's DNA

5

contains far more information and far more personal

6

information than an individual's fingerprints.

7

a doctrinal matter, we think that fingerprinting is

8

distinguishable --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, as

Well, as to -- as to the

10

first, in our cases involving searches for -- where a

11

urine sample is taken to determine drug use, the urine

12

can be analyzed for all sorts of things besides the

13

presence of drugs, and the Court has said, in those

14

cases, we are only going to consider that -- we are

15

considering that this is a reasonable search with

respect to the determination of whether the person has

-- that might be obtained

MR. SHANMUGAM:

from it.

22

Justice Alito, in those cases, cases like Skinner and

view is that fingerprinting is not a search, and, to the

15

extent that this Court has addressed the question, it

16

has suggested that fingerprinting is not a search

17

because an individual has no expectation of privacy in

18

their fingerprints because their fingers are constantly

19

exposed --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would like a complete

21

answer to what Justice Alito and Justice Kagan both were

22

asking, I think.

23

in terms of intrusion, I am not talking legally, I am

24

talking practically.

25

argue that it is certainly a much lesser intrusion than

I mean, to summarize that, if I look,

It doesn't seem to me -- I can

2

3

hard to say it's more, for me, I'm not saying for

4

others.

5

You have to stand there, have the thing
I mean, it's

Accuracy, it's much more accurate, and that

6

doesn't just help the defendant.

There is a whole brief

7

here filed by the victims that have case after case,

8

where people spent 5 years in prison, wrongly, and where

9

this system and the CODIS helped victims avoid being

10

arrested and sent to jail when they were innocent, so it

11

works both ways.

12

So, one, it's no more intrusive; two, it is

13

much more accurate.

And three and four and five, how

14

it's different and worse in practice, is what I would

15

ask you to summarize.

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Sure.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well --

And, by the way, when you

18

talk about what information you could get out of it,

19

there is a brief filed by leading scientists in the

20

field, and I came away from the brief thinking there

21

isn't much more information because fingerprints can be

22

abused, too.

23

Of course, you can learn loads from

24

fingerprints.

Photos, try photos; my God, you could

25

learn a lot, who he was, who recognized -- you know, so
38

Alderson Reporting Company

1

all these things could be abused.

2

that brief, frankly, to think, well, in terms of the

3

possibility of abuse, it's there, but these other

4

things, photos, too.

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

But I came away from

Justice Breyer, let me --

Okay.

So, now, you tell 


me, in light of that hostile question --

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I promise.
I

Will you drop the shoe?

Let me -- I will gladly get

17

to three with regard to fingerprinting, and then I would

18

like to say a word about balancing, in the event that

19

the Court reaches it.

20

balancing is appropriate here because we don't think

21

that the Special Needs Doctrine is applicable, and we

22

don't think that Samson should be extended to arrestees.

23

Obviously, we don't think that

But, with regard to fingerprinting, the

24

other reason why we think fingerprinting is different,

25

above and beyond the fact that we think the better view
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is that fingerprinting is not a search, is because

2

fingerprinting, as it is currently practiced, does serve

3

a special need.

4

The primary purpose of fingerprinting is to

5

identify an individual who is being taken into the

6

criminal justice system.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Shanmugam, that

8

seems to me a real distinction in this case, as it's

9

been litigated.

I take what the government is saying is

10

something like, give us 5 years, and those won't look

11

very different.

12

In other words, we will be able to do, in 5

13

years' time, exactly what we can do with fingerprinting,

14

except it will be, as Justice Breyer says, more

15

accurate.

16

so give us a break.

17

So we are just about 5 years ahead of that,

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And my response to that

18

would be that, under the Special Needs Doctrine, what is

19

relevant is not how a system could conceivably operate;

20

what is relevant is the primary purpose behind the

21

program at issue.

22

So, if the government were to come back in 5

23

years' time with a DNA testing program, the primary

24

purpose of which was pretrial supervision or

25

identification, one of these other purposes that is
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

being offered, then, sure, the analysis would be

2

different.

3

That is simply a consequence of the fact

4

that this Special Needs Doctrine, unlike the rest of the

5

Fourth Amendment, looks to purpose, namely, the purpose

6

of the program at issue.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

A person -- a person has

8

been arrested for a felony and is in custody, do the

9

police -- does the justice system have an interest in

10

knowing whether that person committed other crimes?

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The justice system always

12

has an interest in law enforcement and solving crimes,

13

and we certainly don't dispute that proposition.

14

what we do dispute is Mr. Dreeben's principal submission

15

to this Court, which is that simply because law

16

enforcement can do certain things to arrestees, it can

17

do others.

18

The primary thing is --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

My question is whether or

20

not the police, who have John Doe in custody for a

21

felony, have an interest in knowing, at the outset or

22

within a few weeks' time, whether or not that person has

23

committed other crimes?

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The difference between an

arrestee and an ordinary citizen, Justice Kennedy, is
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that, as to an arrestee, the police have probable cause

2

to believe that the arrestee committed a particular

3

offense.

4
5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But they also have a

reason for keeping him in custody.

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Related --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And my -- my question is,

8

do they have an interest -- a legitimate interest in

9

knowing if that person has committed other crimes?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

10

They have that interest,

11

but, if they want to investigate other crimes, they have

12

to do what they would have to do as to an ordinary

13

citizen.

15

They have to have a warrant or some level of

There are two

18

sure -- we have someone in our custody, and we want to

19

be sure, before he is released back into the community,

20

that he isn't a person who has committed five violent

21

crimes before that.

22

One is we want to

Now, your brief says, well, the only

interest here is the law enforcement interest.

24

found that persuasive because of the concern that it's

25

going to take months to get the DNA back anyway, so they
42

Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official

1

are going to have to release him or not before they know

2

it.

3

But if we are in a position where it now

4

takes 90 minutes -- or will soon take 90 minutes to get

5

the information back, I think that's entirely

6

different because, there, you can find out whether --

7

it's just tied in with the bail situation, do you want

8

to release him or not?

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The touchstone of the

10

analysis, under the Special Needs Doctrine, is what was

11

the primary purpose of the program at issue.

12

is no evidence that pretrial supervision was a purpose

13

of any of these.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And there

Well, that's

15

because -- that's because we are not yet at a situation

16

where it takes 90 minutes.

17

18

in this case.

19

Sure, it's not going to do

But, if it's at the point where it's 90

minutes, it would be critical to make that

21

determination.

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as

23

I said to Justice Kagan, the constitutional analysis may

24

very well change at later point.

25

important to underscore that neither the State of

But I think it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Maryland nor the Federal government identifies a single

2

instance in which a pretrial supervision decision in

3

their jurisdictions was altered as a result of the DNA

4

test.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's put it

6

this way.

Let's -- let's say the judge or the

7

magistrate is going to make a bail determination and he

8

says, well, it's important to me to know whether you are

9

going to commit another crime.
So we are not saying you have to give a DNA

10
11

sample, but it will enter into my calculation if you

12

refuse to do it.

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, outside the

14

programmatic context, ordinary Fourth Amendment rules

15

would apply.

16
17
18

And ordinary -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

mean?

Well, what does that

Is that okay or not?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think, in that

19

circumstance, where there is no individualized

20

suspicion, a search cannot occur.

21

22

And an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, we do it --

23

doesn't that sound just like a Breathalyzer?

24

pulled over, they say, we want you to take a

25

Breathalyzer test.

You are

They say, you don't have to, but, if
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you don't, your license is suspended for 6 months or

2

whatever.

3

Why isn't that the same thing.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well -- you know, I will say

5

that the one thing that is slightly different about your

6

hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the analysis

7

might be somewhat different where what you are talking

8

about is a condition of release.

9

trigger the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine and the

I think you would

10

analysis might operate somewhat separately -- somewhat

11

differently.

12

But, just to conclude with regard to my

13

answer with Justice Kennedy and then to get back to the

14

rest of Justice Breyer's question, Justice Kennedy, with

15

regard to arrestees, the intrusions on privacy that are

16

permissible are all intrusions that relate to the

17

arrest.

18

So to take the two principal examples, the

19

Search Incident to Arrest Doctrine, which you mentioned,

20

and searches associated with an individual's continued

21

detention, so the strip searching example, those

22

doctrines have discrete justifications that limit their

23

scope.

24
25

So the Search Incident to Arrest Doctrine
permits searches for officer safety, to prevent
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

destruction of evidence, and at least in the vehicular

2

context, to search for evidence related to the offense

3

of arrest.

4

Now, none of those rationales apply here,

5

and I would note, parenthetically, that in

6

Schmerber v. California, this Court suggested that the

7

Search Incident to Arrest Doctrine would not permit

8

searches into the body.

9

It will permit only --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we are also talking

10

about identity.

11

number of States, the time between release on bail and

12

return for trial is more than four months.

13

I assume that, in Maryland and in a

And, if it's found, as an identity matter,

14

that this person has a criminal record or that they

15

are -- suspected of serious crimes, that is a

16

mandatory ground for reconsideration of bail.

17

say there is no interest in that.

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And you

I am not disputing that the

19

government has an interest in knowing about prior

20

offenses that an individual has committed.

21

simply saying is that the primary purpose of DNA

22

testing, unlike fingerprinting, is to investigate

23

unsolved crimes.

24
25

What I am

That is the ordinary interest in law
enforcement, and when the government is indicating -46

Alderson Reporting Company

fingerprinting was used to determine whether they -- the

person has a record.

record, that's different from to find out if he has 


7

I thought

We have this person, and now, we

But -- but are fingerprints used to 

determine whether the person has a prior record? 

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Fingerprints taken upon

11

booking are primarily used for the purpose of

12

identification, and, by identification, I would include

13

determining whether the individual had a prior criminal

14

record because, as IAFIS is currently structured, that

15

is information that is returned once there is a hit for

16

that initial search.

17

Now --

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

What was the purpose of

19

fingerprinting before it was possible to make

20

fingerprint comparisons by computer?

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think fingerprinting

22

really has, from the outset, served the purpose of

23

identification because fingerprinting really came into

24

being approximately 100 years ago because, in large

25

urban areas, officers could no longer identify
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

individuals on sight.
Now, to be sure, fingerprinting does serve a

3

law enforcement purpose as well.

4

indicated, there is a latent fingerprint database that

5

roughly corresponds to --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

As Mr. Dreeben

Well, I would assume that,

7

before it was possible to do computer searches, the way

8

in which fingerprinting established identification, what

9

it did in that respect was to identify the person

10

arrested on this occasion, so that, if the person was

11

arrested again, then the police would know that it was

12

the same person.

13

There was no way of -- no practicable way of

14

taking the fingerprints of somebody who was booked and

15

determining whether that person -- you didn't have

16

anything to compare it to.

17

couldn't do it manually.

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And they certainly -- you

That is true.

But, again,

19

the purpose of fingerprinting, as it developed over

20

time, was identification in the sense that, as

21

fingerprints were being collected, individuals could

22

proceed to be identified based on prior --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

Can we go back to --

Yes, so you know that, on

day one, you have arrested -- you've arrested Mr. X, and
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then, a year later, you arrest somebody else, and you

2

know it's Mr. X again.

3

thing, except more accurately.

4

And DNA can do exactly the same

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I think it's important

5

to realize, Justice Alito, that at least, as the DNA

6

system is currently constituted, when an arrestee's

7

profile is prepared, it is compared against the offender

8

and arrestee indices, not the forensic index.

9

And, indeed, as we understand it -- and I

10

think Mr. Dreeben's discussion of this is probably

11

consistent with this, at least on the Federal level, it

12

is not permissible to take that profile and search it

13

against the offender and arrestee indices.

14

Now, that very well may occur in certain

15

States.

16

is what takes place in Maryland.

17

really what distinguishes the way in

18

which fingerprinting is --

unsolved crimes, but criminal history.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9

Sure.

Get to that day.

Well,

Justice Sotomayor -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Tell me what the -- tell

10

me what the -- why you would then say that would still

11

be unconstitutional?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Sotomayor, assuming

13

that this Court does not accept the proposition that

14

arrestees are somehow subject to a lessened expectation

15

of privacy, the only other --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

Let's assume we

17

go under a normal Fourth Amendment, you need probable

18

cause to search.

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Right.

And the only other

20

potentially applicable exception to the principle that

21

warrantless, suspicionless searches are unconstitutional

22

is the special needs exception, and that exception looks

23

to the primary purpose of the program at issue.

24
25

And the mere fact that DNA testing could be
used for other purposes wouldn't necessarily be
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dispositive of the inquiry.

DNA testing is still to investigate unsolved crimes, the

9

says, we are really switching over to a fingerprint

It's not the world we are living in

10

system -- to a DNA system, and what that system is going

11

to allow us to do is it's going to allow us to identify,

12

and it's going to allow us to bring up the old criminal

13

history, and it's going to allow us to see whether there

14

are also unsolved crimes that we can tag to this person

system into effect.

18

And so the government puts that

Is it constitutional?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think that it could be,

19

and that would simply be because you would have a system

20

where DNA testing is essentially being used as

21

fingerprinting is being used today.

22

think --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well -- well ­

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Which is, there is

3

something inherently dangerous about DNA collection that

4

is not the same as fingerprinting.

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, there is, and that

6

gets me back, finally, to the rest of Justice Breyer's

7

question from a few minutes ago because Justice Breyer

8

had kind of asked how the analysis should work, in the

9

event that the Court were to proceed to balancing.

10

And so I just want to say a word about the

11

relevant privacy interests and the relevant governmental

12

interests and to explain why we think that the relevant

13

privacy interests outweigh those governmental interests.

14

On the privacy side of the ledger, we

15

certainly believe that there are profound privacy

16

concerns associated with the government's collection of

17

an individual's DNA.

18

how much personal information is contained in the 13

19

loci -- and we certainly think that there is significant

20

personal information, even as to those loci -- I don't

21

think there can be any dispute that, when you evaluate

22

the entirety of an individual's DNA, there is a great

23

deal of personal information contained there.

24

our view, that has to be taken into account when

25

engaging in balancing.

And, leaving aside the question of

54

Alderson Reporting Company

And, in

Official

1

Now, the government's response to that is

2

essentially the "just trust us" defense; namely, that

3

the government is not looking at all that information,

4

it is only looking at a certain subset of that

5

information.

6

analyzed privacy interests, at least outside the special

7

needs context.

8
9

But that has never been how this Court has

Probably the closest analog is this Court's
decision in Kyllo v. United States, where the Court said

10

that it was of no moment that the heat-sensing device

11

that was at issue in that case did not detect any

12

information about the intimate details of activities

13

within the home.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

all of this intimate private information when you take a

16

drink of water and leave -- leave the glass behind.

said at the outset, we believe that there might still

19

be -- indeed, we think the better view under this

20

Court's cases is that there would still be a Fourth

21

Amendment search there.

22

The only difference would be that you don't

23

have the intrusion into the body that makes the question

24

of whether or not there is a search here an easy one.

25

Now, I want to say just a word about the
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

governmental ­JUSTICE ALITO:

What if someone has a bloody

3

shirt and throws it away in the trash -- in a public

4

trash can along the street, you are saying that the

5

police can't analyze that without a search warrant?

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The argument would be that

7

the subsequent analysis of the DNA, nevertheless, still

8

constitutes a search.

9

on this issue, to date, is the Fourth Circuit's decision

And the most significant decision

10

in United States v. Davis, which I would encourage you

11

to look at, if you are interested in this issue, because

12

it holds that the extraction of the DNA from an item

13

that was lawfully in the government's custody still

14

constitutes a search.

15

Let me say just a word, though, about the

16

governmental side of the balance here because I think

17

this is important.

18

statistics about the efficacy of DNA testing of

19

arrestees, but our submission is, simply, that, when you

20

look at the relevant subset of cases, namely individuals

21

who have been arrested, but who are not subsequently

22

convicted of the offense of arrest, the law enforcement

23

value of DNA testing is relatively modest.

Ms. Winfree started with the

24

My understanding is that --

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

convicted of the offense of arrest. 


2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is correct. 


3

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it was a serious 


4

offense, punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment. 


5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, my client --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't that correct?

7

was sentenced to 4 years.

8
9

And he

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is -- my client was

convicted of the crime of arrest, to be sure.

But,

10

under the Maryland statute, that crime was not a serious

11

enough crime to qualify for DNA collection at that

12

point.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

For Fourth Amendment

14

purposes -- for Fourth Amendment purposes, do you think

15

that it is -- that it is permissible to take a DNA

16

sample from someone who is convicted of an offense that

17

would qualify as a felony under common law?

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We think that it would be

19

permissible to collect DNA from any individual who has

20

been convicted and is subjected to the continued

21

supervision of the State.

22

those individuals have a lessened expectation of

23

privacy.

And that is simply because

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does a felon -- does a

person who has been arrested for a felony have a reduced

expectation of privacy at the time of his arrest?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I would not say that that

17

person has a reduced expectation of privacy.

18

would say is that there are certain intrusions on

19

privacy, some of which are quite substantial, that are

20

permissible because there are justifications unique to

21

the arrest.

Ms. Winfree, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE WINFREE

5
6

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. WINFREE:

On the question of rapid DNA,

7

the FBI estimates that we're about 18 to 24 months away

8

from that world, and I would cite the National District

9

Attorneys Association's amicus brief on page 20 where it

10

discusses the -- that this is not science fiction.

11

we are very, very close to that.

12

So

And I wanted to just address a couple of the

13

questions that arose during Respondent's presentation.

14

Justice Kennedy, the State does have a compelling need

15

and a compelling interest in knowing who is in its

16

custody, and arrestees do not have a legitimate

17

expectation of privacy in their identity.

18
19
20

We have a legitimate and compelling need to
identify suspects and to aid in solving crimes.
And our -- and our definition of what

21

identification is, is somewhat broader than

22

Respondent's.

23

his face is and what his fingerprints show.

24

CODIS DNA profile, those 26 numbers, so that -- in our

25

view, that's a broader definition of -- of identity.

It's not just what his name is and what

59

Alderson Reporting Company

It is that

Official

1

And I wanted also, just finally, to address

2

Justice Alito's question.

This is the fingerprinting of

3

the 21st century, but it's better.

4

evidence is used to identify rapes and murderers.

5

Fingerprints typically do not solve those kinds of

6

crimes.

Typically, DNA

7

And, if the primary purpose of

8

fingerprinting is just to identify, it also is used --

9

fingerprinting, now, is used -- the prints are compared

10

against the latent database in IAFIS, and they are used

11

to solve crimes.

12

kind of crimes that we are talking about here, and it

13

wouldn't have been solved in Mr. -- in Mr. King's case.

14

But they typically don't solve the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How can I base a

15

decision today on what you tell me is going to happen in

16

2 years?

17

DNA available, but we don't now.

You say, in 2 years, we will have this rapid

18
19
20

Don't I have to base a decision on what we
have today?
MS. WINFREE:

Well, that's really only one

21

component of our argument, Mr. Chief Justice, that,

22

certainly, with respect to a bail determination, we will

23

be able to make it more rapidly at the time that that

24

rapid DNA comes into effect.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -Yes, but, if we believe

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the purpose of it has much to do with whether it's

2

legitimate or not, you can't demonstrate that the --

3

that the purpose is immediate identification of the

4

people coming into custody, you just can't demonstrate

5

that now.

Maybe you can in 2 years. 


6

The purpose now is -- is the purpose you 


7

began your presentation with, to catch the bad guys, 


8

which is a good thing.

9

Amendment sometimes stands in the way. 


But -- you know, the Fourth 


MS. WINFREE:

10

It has a corollary purpose,

11

Justice Scalia.

12

that solving crimes, to be sure, is the key component,

13

but in solving crimes and connecting an arrestee to a

14

crime that's unsolved informs a judge's determination

15

about whether to release that individual.

16

What we are suggesting and arguing is

And, as Mr. Dreeben said, bail modifications

17

can happen; they do happen all the time.

18

Maryland, it's going to have -- it's going to be

19

happening before rapid DNA.

20

make that determination in a period between 11 and

21

17 days.

22

And, in

Right now, we are able to

So we are not asking you to base your

23

decision on the futuristic world, which is really only 2

24

years out, with rapid DNA anyway.
