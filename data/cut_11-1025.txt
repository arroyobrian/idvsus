ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


9
10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:

11

The question in this case is whether

12

Respondents have standing to bring a facial challenge to

13

the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence

14

Surveillance Act.

15

the executive to conduct surveillance targeted at

16

foreign persons located abroad for foreign intelligence

17

purposes.

18
19

Along with that grant of authority, Congress
imposed statutory protections designed -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

Those amendments provide authority to

General, is there

anybody who has standing?

22

As I read your brief, standing would only

23

arise at the moment the government decided to use the

24

information against someone in a pending case.

25

that -3

Alderson Reporting Company

To me,

Official

1
2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Several points,


Your Honor --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- would seem to say


4

that the Act -- if there were a violation; I'm not


5

suggesting there is -- but that if there was a


6

constitutional violation in the interception, that no


7

one could ever stop it until they were charged with a


8

crime, essentially.


9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Your Honor, under the


10

statute, there are two clear examples of situations in

11

which the individuals would have standing.

12

The first is if an aggrieved person, someone

13

who is a party to a communication, gets notice that the

14

government intends to introduce information in a

15

proceeding against them.

16

standing could include a facial challenge like the one

17

here.

18

They have standing.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That

General Verrilli, can you

19

be specific on who that person would be?

Because, as I

20

understand it, it's unlikely that, for example, the

21

lawyers in this case would be charged with any criminal

22

offense.

23

be; but, according to the government, their clients have

24

no Fourth Amendment rights because they are people who

25

are noncitizens who acted abroad.

It's more probable that their clients would

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So it's hard for me to envision.

I see the

2

theoretical possibility, but I don't see a real person

3

who would be subject to a criminal charge who could

4

raise an objection.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, if the

6

information were -- if anyone gets notice, including the

7

client, then the lawyer would know, and the lawyer would

8

be in a position at that point to act.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the client is somebody

10

who is abroad and who acted abroad, and is not a U.S.

11

citizen.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That's certainly true.

13

But, in addition, Your Honor, the statute provides that

14

-- that electronic communication service providers can

15

challenge authorizations under the Act, so you -- there

16

certainly would be standing in that instance.

17

There was such a case.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19
20

How likely is it that a

service provider would object?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, the service

21

provider did object to the immediate statutory

22

predecessor to the 2008 amendments.

23

FISA court litigated that constitutional challenge.

24

there's a concrete context there in which it arises.

25

But even -- but beyond that -5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the litigation was

unsuccessful.

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, that's right.

4

Court found there was no Fourth Amendment violation

5

there.

6

The

But I think the point here, Your Honor,

7

is -- the key point is this, that the -- in a normal

8

case, a plaintiff would challenge the application of the

9

authority to that plaintiff.

In a situation like this

10

one, we acknowledge that it may be difficult for a

11

plaintiff to do so because an -- a challenge to the

12

application gets into classified information pretty

13

quickly.

14

I think what the Respondents have tried to

15

do here is to find a theory of the case that avoids that

16

difficulty.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, using what you just

18

mentioned, suppose -- just let's suppose that the Court

19

should hold there is standing.

20

then say as far as the merits of the complaint, this

21

information is classified, these are state secrets, we

22

can't -- we can't go forward with the litigation?

23

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Couldn't the government

That is a possibility.

24

Of course, there's a procedure that the executive branch

25

would have to go through, but that's a possibility.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

But I don't think we can get to that point,

Your Honor, because I do think the key point here is

3

that the Respondents' claims about this statute depend

on a cascade of speculation.

5

authority.

6

for the Respondents to make a claim that they are

7

injured, in fact, by this statute --

8

10
11

This statute only grants

It doesn't command anything.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in order

General, I don't know

that you've answered my question.

Perhaps you have, but

I just want to make sure that I'm clear.
Given that lawyers are unlikely to be the

12

targets of an investigation, if they -- if their

13

conversations would be intercepted, according to you

14

they'd never have standing.

15

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I don't think it's

16

appropriate, Your Honor, to relax the Article III

17

standing requirement of injury in fact based on the

18

reality that the specific applications of this statute

19

may involve classified information.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Verrilli, we've had --

21

we've had cases in the past where it is clear that

22

nobody would have standing to challenge what is -- what

23

is brought before this Court.

24

GENERAL VERRILLI:

25

That's exactly right,

Justice Scalia.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we've said that that

2

just proves that under our system of separated powers,

3

it is none of our business.

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That the Court's

5

authority cannot be invoked in that circumstance.

6

the mere fact that a specific application requires

7

getting into classified matters can't change that basic

8

Article III requirement.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Is the test that you

10

propose that the injury -- I think your brief used the

11

word imminent -- is another way of saying that -- is it

12

unfair to characterize the government's position as

13

saying that you're submitting that the injury must be

14

certain?

15
16
17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.

The key point, I

think, is narrower than that, Justice Kennedy.
This is a case in which the speculation is

18

about the government's conduct, not the connection

19

between the government action and an ultimate effect on

20

the Plaintiff.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let's assume --

22

let's assume for the moment that the lawyer would be --

23

that the lawyer would be injured if his communication

24

with the client were intercepted, or at least that he

25

would have standing to prove injury.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Let's assume that

for the moment.

If that is an acceptable premise, assume

3

that it is, are you saying that it has to be certain to

4

occur?

5

likelihood, and then we get in the middle, is it a


6

substantial likelihood.

7

imminent.


8

And another test is there's a reasonable

9

You have to say -- you say


GENERAL VERRILLI:

being challenged has to either have occurred or be


10

certainly impending.

11

opposite, Your Honor.

12

about --

And here, we have the polar
I think it is important to think

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

15
16

The government conduct


Certainly impending.
Certainly impending.

That's the language from this Court's opinions.
And I think -- I think, if the Court thinks

17

about it, every single case in which the Court has found

18

standing, there's never been a dispute about whether the

19

government was going to act or not; the dispute was only

20

about the connection between the government action and

21

the plaintiff's injury.

22

Here, they're fighting about what --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

this case the Complainant can never know.

25

know you emphasize the speculative nature of this claim,

General Verrilli, but in

9

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, I

Official

1

but it's not speculative if the government being given

2

this authority by Congress is going to use it.

3

that so?

4

I mean, are we to assume that --

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Isn't

Yes, that's not

6

speculative, Justice Ginsburg, but what is speculative

7

is the connection between the grant of authority and a

8

claim of injury.

9

I do think it's important --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it -- you were

10

talking -- you wanted to say there's a cascade of

11

inferences, I think was your phrase.

12
13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

There's a cascade of

speculation --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You want to tell us that

15

in your view these -- all these inference that we're

16

required to go through, if the Respondents' theory is

17

adopted, you were going to tell us about --

18
19
20

GENERAL VERRILLI:
that.

I'd like very much to do

Thank you, Your Honor, yes.
First, the Respondents have to speculate

21

about what the intelligence priorities and objectives of

22

the executive branch are.

23

Second, they have to speculate about how the

24

executive branch officials are going to exercise their

25

judgment to translate those priorities into procedures
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and procedures that comply with the statutory targeting

2

and minimization requirements.

3

Third, they have to speculate about the

4

independent judgment of an Article III court assessing

5

the lawfulness of those procedures and assessing whether

6

those procedures comply with the Fourth Amendment.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there much of a

8

speculation involved in how -- I think it's only one

9

time, and it was under the pre-amended statute, that the

10

FISA court ever -- ever turned down an application.

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, but that, Your

12

Honor, is, I think, not a fair assessment of the

13

process.

14

which there's a dialogue between the executive branch

15

and the FISA court in which the court can demand more

16

information, raise objections.

17

and then there's a final order.

18

It's really very much an iterative process in

Those get worked out,

So I don't think it's fair to infer from the

19

fact that there's only one rejection that this -- that

20

it's a process that isn't rigorous.

21

But, in addition to the speculation I just

22

described, once you get through all that, you still have

23

to speculate about whether the communication that --

24

whether the persons with whom the Respondents are

25

communicating are going to be targeted, and that
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Respondents' communications will get picked up and --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, here is -- I assume

3

that it is an injury for an American speaking in America

4

to have his communication intercepted against his will

5

by the American government.

6

that right?

We take that as a harm; is

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

It may be a harm, yes.
Okay.

So the question is

how likely is that to occur?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

10

No, I think the question

11

under this Court's cases, Your Honor, is whether the

12

government is going to take an action that makes that

13

certainly impending.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Fine.

That's

15

why I say certainly -- it might not be a storm tomorrow.

16

I mean, you know, nothing is certain.

17

some degree of what you say -- some people say

18

certainly, some people say likelihood, etc.

19

to the side.

20

But I see it's

So put that

What I want to know is, we have the

21

declaration of Mr. Scott McKay.

Now, Mr. Scott McKay

22

says he's represented two of the people who are

23

allegedly part of al Qaeda and committed crimes, and he

24

has represented them for some time.

25

Guantanamo.

One was in

Another is charged with various crimes and
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is subject to many, many civil suits.

2

In the course of that, he has to phone and

3

has phoned lots of people in Saudi Arabia, in the

4

various Arab states, and in the past the U.S.

5

intercepted some 10,000 telephone calls and

6

20,000 e-mail communications involving his client.

7

So isn't it a fair inference, almost pretty

8

certain, maybe about as much as the storm, that if the

9

security agencies are doing their job, they will, in

10

fact, intercept further communications involving this

11

particular individual, the two that he's representing?

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Actually, Your Honor -And why doesn't that meet

the test?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

15

-- I think that gets to

16

the last speculative inference that needs to be drawn in

17

order for them to make out their chain of causation, and

18

it's this:

19

surveillance occurs will occur under this authority, as

20

opposed to other forms of lawful authority that they do

21

not challenge.

22

They have to speculate that whatever

And Mr. McKay, that situation is a very good

23

example of this.

We point out in footnote 11 at page 32

24

of our brief that Mr. McKay says, yes, my client was

25

subjected to 10,000 interceptions of phone calls, 20,000

interceptions of e-mails.

3

before it was amended in 2008 --

4

Every one of those, it's a

JUSTICE BREYER:

But why can't we get an

5

answer to that question?

I mean, I see your point.

I'm

6

interrupting because I -- I see where you're going.

And

7

it seems to me that, at least, if held in camera, I

8

can't imagine what security it would violate, whether

9

the government were to say, if necessary privately to a

10

judge, would say, no, we do not intend to use this new

11

authority for this purpose.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But he's just -Or it could say the

14

contrary.

And so couldn't we find out whether he has

15

standing there without jeopardizing any concern of

16

national security?

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think you can't get

18

there without establishing that there's a case of

19

controversy.

20

And they haven't -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, there is if, in fact,

21

the government is going to use this statute to continue

22

to do some of the 10,000 or 20,000 --

23
24
25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But this case is at

summary judgment now, and the -JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

-- Respondents moved for

2

summary judgment based on the declarations that they

3

submitted.

4

contain the information I described.

5

And the declarations that they submitted

And so the only information that's in front

6

of the Court in making a decision now is information

7

that that surveillance occurred under another authority

8

that still exists and could still be applied --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't see how that

10

is pertinent.

What you're saying is they don't have

11

standing to challenge program A because they may also be

12

injured under program B.

13

a case where we've held that?

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And do you have an example of

I think it's -- I think

15

the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is redressability, in

16

that the argument of the lawyers is that we have a duty

17

to incur costs to avoid the surveillance, but that duty

18

is triggered by, according to their expert affidavit --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there again,

20

it depends how you phrase their injury.

21

their injury as being subject to surveillance under a

22

particular statutory provision that they think is

23

facially invalid, saying that, well, you're not going to

24

get any relief because you're going to be subject to

25

surveillance under a different provision, I mean, they

surveillance under 1881a.

show a concrete application of the authority they're

challenging.

13

we've cut the baloney that fine?

14

Do you know any case where we've --

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, I don't.

I do think the redressability point is a valid one.

16

They have to show --

19

going to be injured by being overheard.

20

saying that they will be overheard anyway, and,

21

therefore, by preventing the government from overhearing

22

them under this statute, we're not redressing their

23

grievance, which is being overheard by the government.

24
25

General Verrilli --

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, the thing is they are
And you're

That's precisely what I'm

saying.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, General Verrilli, this

2

statute greatly expands the government's surveillance

3

power.

4

these lawyers' perspective is, what chance do I have of

5

being overheard, and what precautions do I have to take,

6

this statute makes them think about that question in an

7

entirely different way, doesn't it?

8
9

Nobody denies that.

And so if the question from

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think, as

compared to -- let me make two points about that.

10

First, in terms of the expansion of authority, yes,

11

that's fair with respect to the authority that existed

12

immediately preceding the statute.

13

I actually think -- a bit of context is

14

relevant here -- that what this statute was trying to do

15

is reset the initial balance that Congress struck under

16

FISA in 1978, when the large majority of overseas

17

communications were carried by satellite and, therefore,

18

not within FISA.

19

And, of course, what --

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but if you take the

21

baseline position before this statute and the position

22

after this statute, these lawyers and other people in

23

their situation are going to understand that this is

24

just true, that the government is intercepting more

25

material, and that they have to take greater precautions
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in order to keep their conversations confidential, if

2

that's what they want to do, which lawyers want to do.

3

So they're going to take precautions that

4

they wouldn't have had to take the day before this

5

statute was passed, it seems to me, just from a kind of

6

commonsensical point of view.

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I don't agree with that,

8

Justice Kagan.

I think -- this statute does not

9

regulate them.

It confers authority on the government.

10

They take whatever precautions they choose to take based

11

on their beliefs about how that authority's going to be

12

exercised.

That depends on the speculation I described.

13

What this Court held in Summers is that you

14

have to have a concrete application of the authority in

15

order to meet the minimum constitutional requirement for

16

Article III standing.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now we're back at the

18

same circle we started with, which is the one that

19

Justice Breyer started with.

20

under -- who has been surveilled continuously, tens of

21

thousands of interceptions.

23

authority that it sought just for the purpose of

24

ensuring that it casts a broader net?

General Verrilli, this case is any different from

In Monsanto, the government deregulates


Now, there were these farmers who were


10

complaining, and they said, we don't know if that will

11

contaminate our crops or not; we think that there's a

12

significant risk that it will contaminate our crops.

13

Because we think that there's that significant risk, we

14

have to take precautions.

15

Now, why isn't that exactly what's happening

in this case?

18

conversations will be surveilled, a risk that didn't

farmers in Monsanto took; therefore, there is standing.

at all, General Verrilli --

GENERAL VERRILLI:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- and then --- because, in fact, what

10

Monsanto did -- it's not Congress; it's an agency -- but

11

the agency issued a rule saying that farmers could go

12

plant genetically modified crops.

13

And then there was the question whether,

14

because of that, essentially, delegation of authority,

15

the plaintiffs in that case were going to be burdened.

16

And the plaintiffs said, you know, we might be harmed,

17

and we have to take precautions in order not to be

18

harmed.

19

So it's the same thing.

It's a different

20

actor, but it's a delegation of authority and a -- and a

21

fear that that delegation of authority will result in

22

harm leading to a set of precautions.

23
24
25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

There is at least two

differences, Justice Kagan, with all due respect.
First, there is an exercise of the
20

Alderson Reporting Company

1

delegation of authority in Monsanto that is not present

2

here.

3

authority will be exercised.

Here, there is speculation about how the

4

Second, with respect to the authority, the

5

record in that -- in Monsanto showed the seeds were in

6

the ground, and the only question was a question of

7

scientific assessment about the likelihood that the

8

plaintiff farmers' crops were going to be affected, and

9

that was a scientific judgment based on the pollination

10

radius of the bumblebee, whether it would affect their

11

crops.

12

But what we're talking about here is

13

speculation about how government officials are going to

14

exercise policy judgments to implement the statute

15

and --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, is it really such

17

speculation, General?

18

that -- yourself in this lawyer's position, and the

19

lawyer says, I'm representing a person associated with a

20

terrorist organization, I'm representing KLM in the case

21

of one of these lawyers, and I'm going to be talking to

22

that person's family members and associates and trying

23

to find out everything that I can.

24
25

I mean, just imagine

Now, as a lawyer, would you take
precautions, or would you pick up the phone and start

writing e-mails to all those people?

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

If I took precautions, it

of me taking those precautions.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It doesn't change the

I don't even think it has to

8

do with an ethics rule.

9

forget the ethics rule and how the ethics rules apply.

10

Are you really going to tell me that you, as a lawyer,

11

would just pick up the phone in the face of this statute

12

and talk to -- these terrorists' associates?

13

If you're a good lawyer --

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Your Honor, it seems to

14

me that that hypothetical is a variant of exactly the

15

argument that the Court rejected in Summers.

16

isn't a concrete application.

17

There

In Summers, the Court said, even in a

18

situation where it would be likely that some members of

19

the Sierra Club would be affected by the exercise of

20

authority that the statute conferred, that you cannot --

21

you do not have a case --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In Summers, the Court

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Excuse me.

In Summers, the

2

Court said, well, we don't know that this person is just

3

going to stumble upon a piece of land that's affected by

4

this government action.

5

I asked you a different question.

You're a

6

lawyer representing a terrorist and talking to the

7

terrorist's affiliates, and the question is, is this

8

statute going to make you not use the e-mail in the way

9

that you ordinarily would use the e-mail?

10

Well, given the availability of traditional

11

FISA surveillance, surveillance under Executive Order

12

12333, surveillance by foreign governments, I don't

13

think it depends on this statute.

14

But -- but, in any event, whatever the

15

reasonable judgment of a lawyer in those circumstances,

16

there isn't a concrete application of the statute that

17

creates a case or controversy here.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You never know.

There

19

may be dozens of concrete applications affecting the

20

Plaintiffs in this case, but we will never know.

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I do think the

22

problem here, Justice Ginsburg, really is -- the heart

23

of the matter here really is that in a normal lawsuit a

24

plaintiff would challenge the application of a statute,

25

of the authority conferred under the statute.
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Here, that would run into classified

2

information.

3

theory that allows them to avoid that problem.

4

is inherently based on speculation, and I --

5

So the Respondents have tried to plead a

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it

Well, you think it's

6

speculation.

The government has a statute that says you

7

can wiretap in the United States organized crime when

8

life is at stake and you show it to a judge.

9

say, that isn't good enough.

Then they

We pass a new statute, and

10

it says, suppression of organized crime, wiretap when

11

you want, without a judge.

12

Now, a lawyer who represents organized crime

13

says, my clients have been wiretapped under the first

14

statute 400,000 times.

15

Now, I'll tell you, when the government gets

16

ahold of this second statute, it's going to be a million

17

times, because they want to suppress organized crime.

18

I'm not saying my clients are guilty, but we all know.

19

Okay.

20

So.
Now, the question, which I haven't thought

21

of before, you are saying no standing, no standing,

22

can't raise it --

23

GENERAL VERRILLI:

In a case like that, the

24

lawyer -- the normal course would be for the lawyer to

25

challenge the application of the statute.

here is that I think Congress was sensitive to the

Our cases, of

10

course, say, do say "certainly impending," not

11

"substantial risk."

12

MR. JAFFER:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

13

there is a -- a question even in cases that involve only

14

a future injury, whether "certainly impending" is in

15

fact the standard.

16

is not a case that involves only an allegation of future

17

injury.

between those two.

You have two arguments; one is likelihood of

Honor, that the Court has settled on certainly

impending.

3

are cases like -- I think that the one that the

government cites, relies on most heavily is Summers.

5

But in Summers, the distinction between likelihood and

6

certainly impending was not one that the Court relied on

in -- in that decision.

couldn't meet even the lower standard.

the discussion of certainly impending --

10

The cases that the -- the government cites

The Court said that plaintiffs

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So I think that

But both in Summers and

11

Monsanto the government tells us:

12

governmental act was occurring, and then once we knew

13

that, the question was substantial risk.

14

MR. JAFFER:

We knew that the

Justice Kennedy, the -- the --

15

the cases that we rely on, Monsanto, Laidlaw,

16

Meese v. Keene, these are cases in which the Court

17

didn't look to the certainly impending standard at all.

18

The question that the Court asked in those cases was:

19

Is there a substantial risk?

20

risk that effectively compels the plaintiff to act in

21

the way they are -- they are acting?

22

Is there a substantial

You are right that the government points out

23

this distinction in Monsanto.

They say Monsanto is a

24

case in which the government was actually doing

25

something, was known to -- to be doing something.
29

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official

1

even, in this case, first of all, we know that the

2

government is using the statute.

They have acknowledged

3

that they are using the statute.

So there -- there is a

4

certainty of government conduct.

5

But aside from that, those cases like

6

Monsanto and Laidlaw and Meese are not cases that --

7

that actually turned on the fact that the government was

8

doing something.

9

that there was a substantial risk of future injury, and

They are cases that turned on the fact

10

the substantial risk compelled plaintiffs to do

11

something immediately.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not enough, of

13

course, to know that the government is using the

14

statute.

15

clients have been injured, not whether the statute's

16

being used.

17

The whole question is whether or not your

MR. JAFFER:

I -- I agree with that.

I

18

don't think it would be enough for a plaintiff to walk

19

into court and say the government is using the statute

20

and therefore we have standing.

21

not in that position.

22

25

But our plaintiffs are

Our plaintiffs --

MR. JAFFER:

Sure.

I was just going to say

that our -- our plaintiffs have -- have reasons to

believe that their own communications will be monitored

5

under the statute.

6

information that they routinely exchange over the phone

it's also that -- that plaintiffs communicate with the

kinds of people the government is likely to -- to

monitor under the statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does that assessment take

12

into account the fact that a court is going to pass upon

13

the government's ability to intercept these

14

communications?

15

MR. JAFFER:

It does, Justice Scalia.

I

16

mean you -- you are right that there is a court that in

some sense stands between plaintiffs and the future

provisions would produce a violation of the Fourth

The -- the court --

would presumably know that.

20

So

MR. JAFFER:

Okay.

So the FISA Court

As I

target was identified and FISA decided whether there

cause.

6

8
9

Under this new statute, the government doesn't

So, there isn't that check.

MR. JAFFER:
Justice Ginsburg.

There isn't that

That's absolutely right,

There -- the whole point of the

10

statute was to remove those tests, to remove the

11

probable cause requirement, and to remove the facility

12

of requirement, the requirement that the government

13

identify to the court the facilities to be monitored.

14

So those are gone.

15

That's why we use the phrase "dragnet

16

surveillance."

I know the government doesn't accept

17

that label, but it concedes that the statute allows what

18

it calls categorical surveillance, which -- which --

19

which is essentially the surveillance the plaintiffs

20

here are concerned about.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you address --

If we accept the -- if we

23

assume for the sake of argument that "certainly

24

impending" is the, the general standard, if we accepted

25

your other argument, that the plaintiffs have standing
33

Alderson Reporting Company

because they took preventative measures, wouldn't that

undermine completely the -- the "certainly impending"

standard?

of the person's conversation being intercepted, but it's

not certainly impending.

MR. JAFFER:

You have a person who is in a situation where

So then the person simply

I don't think it would

undermine the -- the future injuries standard, Your

11

Honor, for a couple of different reasons.

12

that "fairly traceable," which is the standard that the

13

Court has used when there is an actual injury, is a

14

standard that does real work.

The first is

So if plaintiffs, for example, were acting

15
16

unreasonably in taking the measures they are taking, if

17

plaintiffs were gratuitously buying flight tickets, they

couldn't create standing out of nothing.

MR. JAFFER:

You are right, Justice Scalia.

But that's his question.

Doesn't it undermine the certainly impending?

MR. JAFFER:

And the only point I was trying

6

to make is that if there is a distance between these two

7

standards, it's a -- it's a pretty narrow distance.

8

the other point I want to make is just that the

9

reason -- to the extent the Court has imposed a higher

10

standard for cases involving only future injury -- and

11

again, we don't concede that the Court has imposed a

12

higher standard, but to the extent it has, it has done

so because it wants to assure itself that the future

injury is sufficiently concrete to warrant the Court's

intervention.

something like this -- and I don't think that they would

2

it actually does seem completely reasonable that they

-- causation, but that seems

to me the strongest of the government's arguments.

16

MR. JAFFER:

Well, Justice Kagan, this is

17

something that the declarations address specifically,

18

the distinction between the burden imposed by FISA,

19

traditional FISA, and the -- the burden imposed by the

20

new statute.

21

And it's true that the old -- under the old

22

statute, plaintiffs were required to take precautions

23

with respect to a subset of their communications.

24

they acknowledge that in their declarations.

25

And

But the new statute reaches whole categories

of people who couldn't have been reached under FISA.

2

FISA had a probable cause requirement.

It had to be a

3

foreign agent on one end of the phone.

And so when one

4

of the lawyers in this case was talking to somebody who

5

they thought the government might believe to be a

6

foreign agent, they took those precautions even before.

7

But now they have to take those

precautions -- some of which are very costly -- they

have to take those precautions with respect to people

assessment about the sensitivity of the information,

about the ways that information might be used against

So, for example, if she is talking to a

journalist in Afghanistan about the detention of one of

her prisoners at Bagram Air Base, that is a conversation

every area of practice.
But this is a statute that is focused on

3

gathering foreign intelligence information, and our

clients include lawyers who represent defendants charged

with foreign intelligence-related crimes.

Suppose you have a case where a lawyer says,

Whether he would have a claim is a different
question, but I think he would have standing.

a challenge to the rules that allowed for blood tests of

I think the -- which I

think is difficult, because it makes this case somewhat

unique, so that what you're worried about most is the

definition of foreign intelligence information, which

defines it to include information with respect to a

foreign power or foreign territory that relates to the

conduct of foreign affairs.

whole point of this statute was to allow the government

So there is a sense in which Americans --

6

the surveillance of Americans is incidental, but it's


7

a --

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't what you just


suggested as a way of resolving this case rather


10

bizarre?

Someone who is -- whom the government believes

11

to be a top terrorist and a great threat to the country

12

can stop the use of this surveillance by hiring an

13

American lawyer and then having the American lawyer come

14

into court and say -- you know, challenge the

15

constitutionality of this, and the way to resolve the

16

case would be for the government to go into court and

17

say:

18

target this -- this person whom we believe to be a great

19

security threat?

Well, we're not going to -- we're not going to

20

MR. JAFFER:

I -- I didn't mean to suggest

21

something like that, Justice Alito.

22

ultimately, the authority that the government has

23

claimed under this statute is what requires the

24

plaintiffs to take the measures that they're taking.

25

that plaintiffs had standing to bring a pre-enforcement

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Jaffer, apart -- apart

14

from the government's power that you point out to

15

conduct some of this surveillance without approval by

16

the FISA court in an emergency situation for 1 year,

17

leaving that aside, I don't see how the rest of your

18

challenge or your challenge to the remainder of this

19

statute can be characterized as a facial challenge,

20

because it necessarily assumes that the FISA court will

21

mistakenly say that there has been no Fourth Amendment

22

violation, doesn't it?

23

MR. JAFFER:

I don't think that's so,

realm of -- -- of the conceivable that -- that the court

"I raise soybeans and people around me raise soybeans,

15

up to this point, but, you know, this might be something

16

they will do in the future and if they do that, then I'm

17

going to have to take precautions."

18

MR. JAFFER:

I think that would be a much

19

harder case than the one that they've brought.

I mean,

20

in part because the Plaintiff would presumably know

21

when -- when the soybeans had been -- had been planted,

22

and the Plaintiff would then have an opportunity to come

23

into court.

24

And it would be hard to -- to establish, I

the problem of speculation there.

19

And if I could, Justice Breyer, go to your

20

proposed solution.

I don't think it's a solution.

21

think it's a mechanism for people who think they may be

22

under surveillance, foreign terrorists who think they

23

may be under surveillance, to find out whether they are

Now, three broader points, if I may.

2

First, the -- in every case in which the

3

Court has found standing, every one on which the

4

Respondents rely, the government conduct either happened

5

or was certain to happen.

6

In Meese against Keene, the films had been

7

labeled as political propaganda.

8

about how authority to do so would be exercised.

9

Laidlaw, the permit had issued, and the pollution was in

10

the water.

case.

14

That's true in every

And Summers drew a distinction with those

15

cases because, in Summers, there was no example of a

16

concrete application of the authority.

17

Second, their -- the fact that some of their

18

clients may take steps that incur costs doesn't change

19

the injury.

20

subjective chill that Laird said was -- was not

21

sufficient to establish standing.

22

It's still speculative.

It's the kind of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

is not about the merits of the statute.

4

no claim on the merits at all, and so there would be no

5

question of invalidation.

6

they make their argument to a court?

7

No, General Verrilli, this
They might have

The question is only:

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Can

But the whole point,

8

Justice Kagan, the basic, most fundamental point about

9

the case or controversy requirement and the

10

injury-in-fact requirement that is embedded in it is to

11

preserve the separation of powers.

12

They are asking the Court to consider

13

invalidating the statute based on an assumption either

14

that there is dragnet surveillance or an assumption

15

that their clients are going to be put under

16

surveillance, without a single fact to substantiate

17

either of those assumptions.

18

I submit to the Court that it would be --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which they can never,

20

never have, and that's what makes this -- if -- if there

21

22

23

You did mention minimization procedures as

24

one safeguard against abuse.

What are the minimum --

25

what -- what minimization standards are taken that will

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's a little bit hard to

3

talk about, Your Honor, because, to the extent we're

4

talking about the process of acquiring foreign

5

intelligence, that's a very sensitive intelligence

6

method; and, to the extent minimization plays into that,

7

it's -- it's not public information.

8
9

But there are some steps that are publicly
known, and they are, for example, that information

10

acquired can be retained only for certain limited

11

periods of time; that whenever -- when reports are done

12

on information, that the names of U.S. persons or

13

corporations are redacted.

14

on the ability to use the information.

15

steps of that nature.

16

There are other restrictions

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So there are

Are there restrictions on

17

giving the information to other government agencies, in

18

particular, the Justice Department?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, that -- that --

20

again, Your Honor, there are procedures that govern

21

those issues.

22

They're not public procedures, but there
