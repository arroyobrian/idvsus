ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN N. KOESTER, JR.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. KOESTER:

10
11

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the
Court:

12

In the course of a drunk driving

13

investigation, quickly securing blood alcohol evidence

14

with as little delay as possible is incredibly

15

important --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How come it took so long

17

for this State to figure out that it needed to do this

18

without a warrant?

19

MR. KOESTER:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

Well -The officer testified

that he's been making drunk driving arrests for years --

22

MR. KOESTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and I think in only

24

one circumstance did he need to do it without a warrant.

25

So what made the need here eminent in the sense of

impractical to get the warrant?

2

MR. KOESTER:

Well, Your Honor, back in

3

2003, there was a -- an appellate court case from

4

Missouri that dealt with the importance of the words --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, I understand why he

decided to do it, to forego getting a warrant.

11

The issue was, it was going to take a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it took a

considerable amount of time for all the years he did it.

16

MR. KOESTER:

That's true, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and he didn't

18

testify to it -- it causing a loss of any particular

19

case.
MR. KOESTER:

20

But in this particular case,

21

it was going to take 90 minutes to two hours to secure

22

the warrant.

23

probative evidence was going to be dissipating, was

24

going to be lost.

25

And during that period of time, the most

But he said -- he said in

the ten or so cases he had had in the past, I had -- I

2

3

cases.

4

on the facts from other cases on the facts.

There was nothing that distinguished this case

5

MR. KOESTER:

That's correct, Justice

6

Ginsburg, he never had a problem securing a warrant, but

7

there was a delay; and that's -- that's the difference.

8

We're -- we're looking at a delay, and quickly securing

9

blood alcohol evidence is important because the -- the

10

evidence is being lost at a significant rate with every

11

minute that passes.

12
13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What constitutional

right exists for a State to get the best evidence?
MR. KOESTER:

14

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

15

think that that is something that we should always

16

strive for, to be able to get the best possible evidence

17

in the case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

No, no, no.

You, the

19

State, want to strive for that.

20

Amendment contemplates that that's a right the State

21

must have, that is has to get the very best evidence it

22

can?
MR. KOESTER:

23

But what in the Fourth

The -- the touchstone of any

24

Fourth Amendment analysis is the reasonableness of the

25

search.

And it's reasonable -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how can it be

7

They don't intrude into your

13

Court's print, on:

Use the most intrusive way you can

15

MR. KOESTER:

16

would -- I would disagree with that.

17

in our favor, I think the end result will be more people

18

will agree to take the breathalyzer test.

19

the arresting officer gave the defendant an option to

20

take the breathalyzer test and when he clearly told him

21

he was not going to take it, that's when he decided to

22

take him to the hospital in order to draw the blood.

And, Justice Sotomayor, I

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If the Court rules

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what is the

3

difference between the reliability or the acceptability

4

by juries of a breathalyzer test, as opposed to a blood

5

draw?

6

MR. KOESTER:

Justice Scalia, both tests are

7

very reliable.

We rely on the breathalyzer test on a

8

daily basis, but for practical reasons it's very

9

difficult to force a drunk driver to take a breath test.

10

The breathalyzer instruments, they measure deep lung

11

alveolar air.

12

And you have to take a very deep breath.

13

And one police officer told me it's sort of like you can

14

put a balloon in front of somebody's mouth, but you

15

can't make him blow it up.

16

practical reasons to force someone to -- to blow into

17

the breathalyzer.

18

It's very difficult for

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we are talking about

19

reasonableness, do you think it's relevant for us to

20

look to the rules and practices of other States?

21

MR. KOESTER:

Justice Kennedy, as the

22

Respondent points out, there are 25 States that would be

23

opposed to -- to the warrantless blood draw at issue in

24

this case.

25

those States have joined amicus Delaware urging this

And as I point out in the reply brief, 15 of

2

Court, but I think --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the fact that those

4

States do have a warrant requirement and from what we

5

can best tell make it work very well, including some

6

expedited procedures where you can get warrants within

7

minutes -- it takes usually the policemen, say, 20

8

minutes to get just to the hospital or the police

9

station anyway.

10

MR. KOESTER:

And, Justice --

11

And if -- if we see that other States, a

12

significant amount of other States, number one, require

13

the warrant, number two, many of those have expedited

14

procedures, does that bear on our determination of

15

reasonableness?

16

MR. KOESTER:

I don't believe it does,

17

Justice Kennedy.

18

plainly teaches, individual State laws do not affect

19

whether or not this activity was reasonable under the

20

Constitution.

21

I think, as -- as Virginia v. Moore

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we have -- have

22

always -- correct me if I'm wrong.

23

always thought of Fourth Amendment reasonableness

24

standards as being a national standard.

think a vast majority of States disapproved of that

well not have permitted it because they were under what

you would call the mistaken belief that it was

I suppose that is -- that is a

18

possibility, Justice Scalia.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there any showing that

20

conviction rate in those States is lower than in the

21

States where the practice is -- is to take the test

MR. KOESTER:

2

pretty clear that if you have concrete evidence of a

3

drunk driver's blood alcohol content, concrete evidence,

4

that gives you a far greater case, a far greater chance

5

of securing a conviction at trial.

6

But I think it's -- it's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the new rule is we

7

have to strengthen -- the Fourth Amendment is going to

8

be suspended whenever the prosecution can't get the best

9

evidence to make its case out?

10

MR. KOESTER:

No, Justice Sotomayor.

I

11

think as long as a police officer has probable cause,

12

what -- what we're saying is it's objectively --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Probable cause is

14

not enough.

If you have probable cause, then you can

15

get a warrant.

16

rule that if you can get a warrant, you must do that.

17

Probable cause is surely not enough.

18

need a warrant when there's probable cause.

But it was and I think still is the main

MR. KOESTER:

19

Then we'd never

20

Justice Ginsburg, probable cause is not enough.

21

probable cause coupled with the indisputable fact that

22

alcohol is eliminated from the human body with every

23

minute that passes after a drunk driver is pulled

24

over --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But

Mr. Koester, suppose that,

10

instead of waiting two hours, there were procedures in

2

place in Missouri and, indeed, across the country where

3

it was possible to get a warrant in these circumstances

4

within 15 or 20 minutes.

5

there is a sufficient exigency to avoid the warrant

6

requirement?

7

MR. KOESTER:

Would you still be saying that

I think if a particular

jurisdiction had perfected the warrant process to the

9

point where they could routinely obtain search warrants

10

in 15 minutes, I think we would have a different

11

outcome.

case.

13

think it is a time-consuming process to obtain search

14

warrants.

I think that would affect the analysis of the

But with all due respect to the hypothetical, I

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

So why can't you do that?

16

I mean, the only virtue I see in saying you have to go

17

get a warrant is the officer picks up the phone, there

18

is usually somebody on duty, a magistrate somewhere, he

19

phones him up and says, I have a drunk driver here; he's

20

wobbling, he can't cross the center line; and he won't

21

take a breathalyzer; I want to give him a test.
Now, you have a second judgment and the

22
23

officer has to talk to somebody, so he's a little more

24

careful.

this person, but a protection for others who maybe

All right.

So I think that's the question

you're being asked.

Why -- what's the problem with

4

doing that?

5

this warrant really is -- this search is really

6

necessary.

Which adds a little bit of security that

sounds like that would be an instantaneous procedure,

3

but some of the lower courts that have actually examined

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Koester, in most

correct.

line where -- where the exigency would disappear.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So would the importance

17

of the search warrant suggest, as a constitutional

18

right, suggest that we should judge reasonableness by

19

the people who are the least efficient or by the people

20

who are the most reasonably efficient?

That would have to be

Jurisdictions have an

7

incentive to get a warrant, I would think.

Even if

8

they -- even if we were to say that they don't need one,

9

they certainly have a strong incentive to get warrants

because it insulates the search to a much greater degree

from later challenge -- at a suppression hearing.

12

why shouldn't it depend on the practicalities in a

13

particular jurisdiction?

So

14

Not every jurisdiction has prosecutors and

judges who are staying up at -- you know, 3:00 o'clock

So why -- but if you are in a big

just going to ask whether what they did was reasonable.

For example, Respondent here's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But there are so many

8

situations in which we require a warrant, nevertheless.

9

When there is drug dealing in a house, every time people

10

enter that house, it's almost a certainty that they're

11

going to use the drugs and that evidence is going to

12

disappear.

likely to be telltale signs left over.

You rely on hope -- on knowing that there's

And that's the same thing you do in an

15

alcohol situation.

You rely on the testimony of the

police officer, you rely on the implied consent

presumption.

evidence, and -- and not like a fleeing situation where

19

someone gets away, you have nothing left.

20

this is vastly different.

I mean, with respect, we

I mean, it is the case that blood alcohol

2

make it more important.

3

In 2005 you had --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You mentioned Schmerber.

4

Why did the Court go through all of the -- why -- it

5

could have made it a much shorter opinion by simply

6

saying, yes, blood alcohol dissipates.

7

It -- it pointed out that in that particular case there

8

was a delay to investigate the accident, the person had

9

to be taken to the hospital for care, so how much time

10

elapsed?

11

But it didn't.

I think it was two hours, wasn't it?
MS. SAHARSKY:

The Court -- made a mention

12

of two hours, but that was not a critical portion of its

13

analysis.

14

Schmerber because the Court said, first, there was clear

15

probable cause in that situation.

16
17

We don't think that that mattered to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Second of all --

What was all the -- why

was it in the opinion?

18

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, it's one line in the

19

opinion.

20

the percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to

21

diminish shortly after drinking stops, the body

22

functions to eliminate it from the system.

23

in a case like this, time had to be taken to bring the

24

accused to a hospital and to investigate the scene --

25

If you look at it, the Court says, we are told

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Particularly

They didn't need to

say any of that.

2

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, they said particularly

that the first thing wasn't enough.

if there was some uncertainty in Schmerber, the Court's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it doesn't mean
And what we say is

That doesn't mean that it

was enough, either, right?
MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, that gives me the

10

second part of my answer, which is the Court's cases

11

since Schmerber have relied on the destruction of this

12

evidence being enough for exigency.

13

And I would just point the Court to look at

14

Skinner, at South Dakota v. Neville, at Winston v. Lee,

15

and even in a footnote in Kentucky v. King.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This Court

Counsel for Missouri tells

19

us, Ms. Saharsky, that the breathalyzer is just as good

20

and that in fact he expects that the consequence of our

21

ruling in his favor in this case will be that drunken

22

drivers will agree to the breathalyzer test.

23

But I don't know why it isn't adequate to

24

produce that result simply to put the drunken driver in

say -- you know, we're going to be in the hospital in

2

20 minutes; we're applying for a warrant; when we get

there, we're going to -- we're going to -- you know,

4

stick a needle in your arm, unless, of course, you agree

5

to take the breathalyzer test.

6

to -- to force them into the breathalyzer test, so that

7

they will blow up the balloon.

8
9

MS. SAHARSKY:

Why isn't that enough

Well, because in that

situation, I think they're willing to take their chances

10

that the evidence is going to dissipate below the .08

11

standard or below these higher enhanced penalties, .15,

12

and then be able to challenge it, as opposed to if they

13

gave the evidence that they potentially wouldn't be able

14

to challenge it.

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, I think there are two

2

answers.

3

one officer on the scene who's proceeding with this and

4

he's the one that would have to prepare the affidavit,

5

typically the one to consult with the prosecutor.

6

the one who's going to drive to the hospital.

7

Presumably, we don't want him texting during driving, et

8

cetera.

9

One, you typically as a practical matter have

He's

The second answer is a legal answer, which

10

is that the Court has been very hesitant to second-guess

11

the police in these circumstances and to say when the

12

police are in a fluid situation they have to, say, try

13

to get a second officer on the scene and maybe do the --

14

20

have to have a written document.

record needs to be made of it.

there's the time to get to the hospital.

significant --

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then,

And -- you

So a

So is it okay -- is it

okay to let police officers take the blood?

12

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, we think that's a

13

different question and one that the Court reserved in

14

Schmerber.

15

in a medical setting taking the blood in that case.

16

That's the exact same thing that's happening here.

17

The Court said there was medical personnel

But it said if we had a different case, we'd

18

ask whether the -- the situation invited an unjustified

19

element of personal risk of infection and pain.

20

think the Court should get a case that has a record on

21

this and then it could make a determination as to

22

whether there is that risk.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So we

Oh, I bet that if we

rule in your favor, we will.
MS. SAHARSKY:

I'm not sure that that's
27


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

true.

2

having police officers get trained in this way is

3

basically out of necessity.

4

jurisdictions it's too far to get to the nearest

5

hospital.

6

The reason that a few States have considered

It is just in rural

But it's fair to say that police officers do

7

not want to be in this business of taking blood.

It

8

diverts them from their other activities.

It's -- you

9

know, it's an extensive training process.

So I -- I'm

10

not sure that that's true, but it's not something the

11

Court has to decide --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you want to be in

13

those rural places and be stopped without an independent

14

magistrate approving a field officer taking blood from

15

you?

16

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, what I'm saying is that

17

there are only a few States that are doing it now, and I

18

think it is -- it should be -- the Court should wait

19

until it actually has a record to make that

20

determination.

21

along those lines.

But -- you know, there has been training

22

That's something, for example, that NHTSA at

23

the Department of Transportation has helped these States

24

investigate whether it's a real option because the

25

police officers are very far away from -- you know, the
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

nearest hospital and that it's -- it's all based on this

2

concern about destruction of evidence.

3

But just to get back to --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think going back to

5

Justice Scalia's question, if a person does take a

6

breathalyzer, is there ever a reason for a warrantless

7

blood test?

8
9

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

As a general matter,

you would not need to obtain a blood test -- you know,

10

practically because the evidence is not the same, but --

11

you know, substantially as good.

12

little better in that you have a sample that sticks

13

around as opposed to one that is gone.

14

samples, so the defense can test it, and it is better

15

evidence with respect to whether it's susceptible to

16

challenge.

The blood test is a

You also get two

17

You also might have someone who consents to

18

a breath test, but because, as you pointed out, they're

19

so drunk they can't give a good sample, like they say

20

they'll provide a sample, but they really just can't.

21

And then there's another case that is not

22

the fact here, but something we would want the Court to

23

be careful about, which is driving under the influence

24

of drugs.

25

the police officers might have very good reason to

Those do not show up on a breath test, but

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

believe that the person is under the influence, such

2

that they might take a breath test and get a zero

3

reading, but still want to take a warrantless blood

4

test.

5

So all the Court needs to do to resolve this

6

case is say where this person refused a breathalyzer --

7

actually, the exact same facts of Schmerber -- it was --

8

it was reasonable for the police to say, we know this

9

evidence is going away, we know it's going to be lost,

10

maybe we can get a warrant quickly, maybe we can't, we

11

don't know what his blood alcohol is, we don't know when

12

it's going to dip below .15, .08, let's just go ahead

13

and proceed.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

All this talk about -- you

15

know, losing evidence every second, I mean, I suppose

16

the exact same thing could be said in other

17

alcohol-related crimes, public drunkenness, underage

18

drinking.

19

there, would you?

20

You wouldn't be making the same arguments
Or would you?

MS. SAHARSKY:

No.

I mean, the -- the

21

question you'd ask will be the same, which would be a

22

reasonableness balancing test, but I think the

23

government interest on the side of that balance would be

24

very different from the ones at issue here.

25

the Court here has said that drunk driving is a serious

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So it's not just exigency

5

that you're -- you're saying that there should be a

6

weighing of the costs and benefits here.

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

That's what the Court

8

did in Schmerber.

It looked at the intrusiveness of the

9

blood test in this context and then it looked at the

10

government's need for the evidence.

the evidence in the cases you're positing we suspect the

Court would not think as strong as the evidence here.

And the need for

questions the Court has had about the time to get

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN R. SHAPIRO
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the State

may stick a needle in the arm of everyone arrested on

2

suspicion of drunk driving without a warrant and without

3

consent.

4

even in routine DWI cases like this and regardless of

5

how quickly and easily a warrant could be obtained.

Missouri's answer to that question is yes,

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought the question was

7

if -- if in fact the person won't agree to a

8

breathalyzer.

MR. SHAPIRO:

The question is -- it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, aside from all --

2

the thing, what it boils down to, at least in my mind,

3

is, is yes, of course it would be better to -- to have a

4

neutral person hear what the policeman has to say and to

5

act as a second judgment on that; it would make it less

6

likely that people who are really innocent, in fact,

7

have this happen to them and so forth.

8
9

But they're arguing that that's a -- that's
a considerable burden in many, but not all States.

And

10

at some point -- and the addition in respect to the

11

second judgment, namely the magistrates that you get, is

12

not worth really what you're going to lose, which are

13

going to be people who are drunk driving around on roads

14

and -- and possibly killing people.

15

that side can be built up, too.

So at some point, I would

wish you would spend some time addressing that, that

19

practical argument.

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

I'd be happy to answer that

21

question right now, Your Honor.

I think there are two

22

responses.

23

and one is more generic because I think it's important

24

to remember they are not asking simply to reverse the

25

suppression motion in this case on the grounds that the

One is Missouri specific and case specific

34

Alderson Reporting Company

facts of this case made it reasonable to do a

warrantless blood draw.

What Missouri and the United States are

urging is a categorical exemption to the warrant

5

requirement in all DWI cases nationwide.

think not only about --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So we have to

Is this a lot of sound and

8

fury signifying nothing?

I mean, what -- what advantage

9

do you think your client would -- would really get from

10

the warrant requirement other than the delay that that

11

would entail allowing his blood alcohol to reduce

12

itself?

13

Are the -- for some warrants, let's say a

14

warrant to go into a building where the police contend

15

there may be drugs, the policeman will -- will you know,

16

the magistrate will say, What evidence do you have that

there's drugs?

it; he couldn't touch his nose with his index finger.

Are any of these warrants ever turned down?
Are they ever turned down in your experience?

Your Honor, I do not know the

answer to that.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

I bet you they're not.

But I think it's also true,

8

Your Honor, that warrants in general are rarely turned

9

down, that the overwhelming percentage of warrant

10

requests in all criminal cases are granted -- are

11

granted by magistrates.

Is that -- do you think that is consistent
with the Fourth Amendment?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, it's something very

14

close to what Missouri already has, Your Honor.

In Cape

15

Girardeau County the prosecutor has prepared

16

standardized forms which the police officer then fills

17

out, presents to the prosecutor, the prosecutors sends

18

on to the magistrate and the magistrate decides whether

19

to grant the warrant.

20

the opposite direction, which it shows that the process

21

of obtaining a warrant is not very elaborate and it need

22

it not be very timely.

But I think that cuts in exactly

23

And I can imagine, in answer to

24

Justice Scalia's questions, I can imagine circumstances

25

in which an officer might apply for a warrant in a

I don't think you need a warrant to require

that that is a search within the meaning of the Fourth

What about a

breathalyzer, do you need a warrant for that?

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think you probably do need a

8

warrant for a breathalyzer, Your Honor.

9

Missouri's position is you not only don't need a warrant

10

for a breathalyzer, you don't need a warrant for a blood

11

test.

12

But --

And we don't -- this is not a breathalyzer case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know what

13

Missouri's position is, and I know it's not a

14

breathalyzer test.

15

leads to the requirement of a warrant for breathalyzer,

16

that would be pertinent in analyzing your position.

what is reasonable for sticking a needle in your arm is

not necessarily reasonable for asking you to blow up a

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, I certainly want

10

to bite off as little as I have to chew in this case,

11

but -- but there are two salient facts because I think

12

it is important to focus on what is before the Court in

13

this case.

14

a warrantless blood draw, and the two salient facts in

15

my mind are, one, as I said, case specific.

16

And what is before the Court in this case is

You have a State trooper here who has been

17

doing this for 17 and a half years.

He testifies at the

18

suppression hearing that he has only been required to

19

seek a warrant fewer than ten times.

20

is because the overwhelming number of drivers, in fact,

21

give their consent.

22

17 years where he had to seek a warrant, he testifies

23

that he never had any difficulty obtaining a warrant,

24

and there is certainly no indication that those warrants

in any way interfered with the State's ability to

argument, is you incant the totality of the

5

circumstances test.

7

warrant was necessary or not under that circumstance?

14

court below saying, you -- you know, it's okay, you didn't

16

too long to get the warrant because that shows

inefficiency.

21

facts that are extrinsic to the warrant process itself

22

and that are beyond the control of the police that

23

significantly impede the ability of the police even to

24

initiate the warrant process.

25

I think the Court got it right in

I think the question is:

JUSTICE ALITO:

the morning to get the warrant.

4

too bad, everybody has -- the whole country has to

5

operate like New York City, you have to have somebody on

6

duty all the time.

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

You would say, that's

blood?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you agree that

2

that's an exigent circumstance which would allow a

3

warrantless blood sample?

4

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think it might well if the

5

magistrate were unavailable and there were no

6

alternative magistrate.

7

But the second salient fact, Your Honor --

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

isn't it?

Mr. Shapiro, that's a separate question,

I mean, one prong of your argument is you

10

need individualized circumstances, you can't have a per

11

se rule.

12

you get to count in the totality of the circumstances

13

test; is that right?

14
15
16

And now this other set of questions is about what

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct,

Justice Kagan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So one could disagree with

17

you and one could think, as Justice Alito and

18

Justice Kennedy suggested -- you know, you do take into

19

account that it's the middle of the night in a rural

20

county and it's going to take two hours, but still

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct,

opponent's argument, is we know that there are half the

5

They are listed on

Given that fact, in the face of that

6

reality, I don't think Missouri can plausibly claim that

7

a categorical rule that would then apply nationwide if

8

this Court were to announce it in the context of this

9

case, that warrants are never required in routine DWI

10

cases, could satisfy the standard that this Court has

11

established, namely that the exception to the warrant

12

requirement that is being proposed serves law

13

enforcement needs so compelling that a warrantless

14

search is objectively reasonable in every case.

15

There is no evidence that I am aware of, in

16

response to Justice Kennedy's question, and there is

17

certainly no evidence in the record in this case or in

18

the briefs in this case that those 25 States that

19

prohibit warrantless blood draws in the circumstances

20

that my client confronted here have a lower conviction

JUSTICE BREYER:

A lot of States have

23

varying degrees to which they want to enforce strict

24

rules against drunk driving.

25

exactly the kind of thing that worries me on your side.

And a State -- that's

The -- you have a bunch of States that don't -- you

2

know, it's not easy to get hold of a magistrate in

3

15 minutes or so forth.

4

And so what to do about that?

If you say, well, you don't have to because

5

you haven't got it provided, you give them every

6

incentive not to make the magistrate available.

7

cutting in your favor.

8

tough to say that all these States have to have the best

9

possible magistrate available 24 hours a day so somebody

That's

On the other hand, it's pretty

10

can call in ten instances a year because the guy won't

11

take the blood test -- won't take the breathalyzer.

12

And that's where I am in a dilemma.

And so

13

I'm looking for an answer to that.

14

an absolute rule or I don't see an absolute rule.

15

Should you say, look, here's what you have to do, it's

16

better to have a second opinion there, which is the

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I would say several

4

things.

5

reason to believe that there's any jurisdiction in the

6

country at this point that is not deeply concerned about

7

drunk driving, or recognizes that drunk driving is a

8

serious problem.

9

First of all, Your Honor, I really do have no

That is certainly not our position.

Secondly, the reason I think that there is

10

no evidence that in the States that prohibit warrantless

11

blood draws in routine DWI cases like this have lower

12

conviction rates is, number one, in most cases, they can

13

obtain consent; number two, in cases where they can't

14

obtain consent, they have been able to obtain warrants

15

in a timely -- in a timely fashion; and number three,

16

even in the absence of warrants, all the facts that lead

17

to probable cause often create a very compelling case

18

for conviction in the absence of the blood alcohol --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

My question is what you

20

don't want to do and you don't have to, but if you think

21

of a second-best solution it might always be better than

22

what I think of as a second-best solution.

23
24
25

MR. SHAPIRO:

I have enormous confidence in

you, Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- I want to know if you

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

want to say anything that would suggest -- we have a

2

number of them floating around and -- and I just wonder

3

if you want to express any view on a second-best

4

solution.

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, well -- well, our -- our

6

position, and I'm not sure whether you're classifying

7

this as our first position or -- or something else --

8

our position is that within the context of Schmerber, if

9

there are special facts external to the warrant

10

requirement, then you have to apply a totality of the

11

circumstances test, and you ought to apply a

12

reasonableness standard.

13

In the context of the delays that are

14

intrinsic to the warrant requirement, absent and if any

15

evidence that those intrinsic delays have interfered

16

with the ability of 25 States in the country to enforce

17

their drunk driving laws, this Court ought not to adopt

18

a categorical exception to the -- to the warrant

19

requirement.

20

And the risk of doing it, as you pointed

21

out, Justice Breyer, is then you create this odd

22

disincentive, which is the States that have the most --

23

have the slowest and most cumbersome warrant procedures

24

are the States that get a free pass and are able to

25

override the Fourth Amendment.

That seems to me -­

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's not true because

2

there's a great advantage to the prosecution in having a

3

search with a warrant as opposed to a warrantless search

4

in terms of suppression; isn't that correct?

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, there is some advantage

6

to having -- certainly, a search that is conducted

7

pursuant to a warrant is much less subject to

8

suppression than a search that is subject not pursuant

9

to a warrant.

But -- but there is generally speaking in

10

these cases a probable cause that is derived from the

11

officer's observations on the scene and the defendant's

12

performance in the field sobriety test, that -- that --

13

you know, can support the warrant -- support -- support

14

the search.

15

But I think --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I ask you this question?

17

How much blood has to be taken in order to test for

18

blood alcohol?

19

to -- I gather it's a -- it's a substantial amount.

20

what if it advances to the point that you don't need any

21

more blood than you need now to test blood sugar, and

22

you just have a little machine that makes a tiny prick

23

in somebody's finger and you've got enough blood to do a

24

blood alcohol test.

What if medical technology advances

Does it change then?

MR. SHAPIRO:

amount of blood that you take out of somebody's body.

think the Fourth -- an important, maybe not the

5

have checked off all the right boxes before they engage

22

in a process as intrusive as putting a needle in

24
25

Now, in answer to Justice Sotomayor's
question, I think -- I think there are multiple answers,
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Your Honor.

First, this Court has on two

2

occasions considered and rejected the notion that the

3

mere fact that alcohol dissipates over time is itself

4

sufficient to proceed without a warrant.
As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in

5
6

Schmerber, the Court's discussion of what the Court

7

itself called special facts would have been unnecessary

8

if all the Court needed to say was that this natural

9

dissipation of alcohol in the blood automatically would

10

lead to -JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

Mr. Shapiro, Schmerber is an

12

odd case because Justice Ginsburg and you are exactly right,

13

that they spend a lot of time talking about special

14

facts, and particularly so, but then you read the

15

opinion kind of backwards and forwards, and you can't

16

find the special facts.
MR. SHAPIRO:

17

I think the special facts,

18

Your Honor, were the accident and the injuries at the

19

scene, which delayed the police for two hours before

20

they could even get to the hospital and initiate the

21

process of applying for a warrant, at a time when there

22

were no cell phones, there were no faxes, there were no

23

internets, and all warrant applications had to be

24

presented in person.

situation.

That's a very, very different

police officers to the scene, they could have done

everything faster.

If they had sent more police

6

officers to the scene of the accident, if they -- then

7

they could have done it faster.

8

MR. SHAPIRO:

Perhaps.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what's the difference

10

between that practical limitation and the limitation

11

that exists in a world -- in a rural jurisdiction?

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I think that practical

13

limitation, whether or not there were other officers on

14

the scene, right, or that could have been sent to the

15

scene, we're not asking for a rule in which this Court

16

would direct police officers how they -- they ought to

17

deploy their resources.

18

officers on the scene, I don't think it's unreasonable

19

to say one can attend to the accident and the other one

20

can search -- can search for a warrant, and that becomes

21

part of the totality of the circumstances.

22

Schmerber is not the only case, Your Honor.

23

If there are multiple police

But

cases, probably not all, but in most of the cases, the

State's case is going to disappear down the drain along

with the drugs and the ability to destroy the drugs lies

entirely within the control of the defendant.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

raised as saying well, that's -- somebody is going to

19

scrape your fingernails, that's as intrusive as a blood

20

test.

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I would say three

22

things, Your Honor.

I don't think it is as intrusive,

23

although even in Cupp v. Murphy, which is that case, the

24

Court described it as a serious, but brief intrusion on

25

the cherished value of personal security.
59

Alderson Reporting Company

The Court

Official

1

recognized that even the -- the fingernail scrape was --

2

was a serious Fourth Amendment issue.

3

Secondly, that evidence, unlike the blood

4

alcohol evidence, was under the control of the defendant

5

and in that case, on the facts of that case, much like

6

many of the Court's other exigent circumstances cases,

7

there was evidence that suggests that the defendant was

8

actively engaged in the process of degrading the

9

evidence at the time that the police stepped in and said

10

we're going to preserve what is left rather than allow

11

you to be the agent of your own destruction.

12

And as the Court said in Kentucky v. King,

13

it is a very different situation when you have the

14

defendant himself destroying evidence.

15

circumstances, it may be reasonable for the Court to say

16

you can't simultaneously destroy evidence and then

17

protest that the destruction of the evidence -- evidence

18

has created the exigency that requires the State to act

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN N. KOESTER, JR.,

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. KOESTER:

Thank you.

Everyone agrees

20

that the closer a chemical test is taken to the time of

21

driving, the more reliable the evidence of intoxication

22

is, the more reliable the evidence of impairment is.

23

So under the Respondent's approach, it would

24

be mandated that we're going to allow the most reliable

25

evidence to dissipate and degrade over a period of time

61

in favor of admittedly less reliable evidence taken at a

2

later time.

inconsistent with -- with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence
