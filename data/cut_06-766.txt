CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

first today in Case 06-766, New York State Board of

5

Elections v. Torres.

6

Mr. Olson.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS NEW YORK STATE

9

BOARD OF ELECTIONS, ET AL.

10
11

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

For 10 years, New York relied on political

13

party primaries to nominate general election candidates

14

for supreme court justice, but that process discouraged

15

qualified candidates and spawned unseemly, expensive,

16

and potentially corrupting fundraising by judicial

17

candidates.

18

So the legislature substituted an indirect

19

party primary system at which delegates are elected who,

20

in turn, select general election candidates at political

21

party conventions.

22

The Second Circuit concluded that the

23

delegate convention statutes enabled political parties

24

to exercise too much influence at the expense of the

25

insurgent party members or insurgent candidates and
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

struck those statutes down as facially unconstitutional

2

and reinstated the discredited primary process.

3

The issue in this case is whether the

4

delegate-convention system is facially unconstitutional

5

because it allows party leaders to defeat the

6

aspirations of party insurgents.

7

States have broad, as this case has

8

repeatedly held -- broad constitutional latitude to

9

prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections,

10

particularly elections for State office.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

Just focus on, if you

would, Mr. Olson, on the election for the delegates.

13

Now, suppose it were shown -- a hypothetical

14

case -- that it's extremely difficult to get on that

15

ballot.

16

days.

17

that situation?

18

You need, let's say, 2,000 signatures in 30
Would there be a constitutional issue raised by

MR. OLSON:

Well, in the first place, as you

19

know, Justice Kennedy, that -- that is not the case

20

here.

It takes 500 signatures -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MR. OLSON:

A hypothetical case.

If it were an impossible burden

23

to get on the ballot, I still don't think that First

24

Amendment associational rights would be involved.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about Kusper, the

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Kusper case?

2

MR. OLSON:

I don't think the Kusper case

3

goes that far, Justice Kennedy.

4

cases of this Court -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think that, as the

I think we have made it

6

very clear that if you're going to use a primary system,

7

you can't have such burdensome registration requirements

8

that the primary system is not, to all intents and

9

purposes, to all intents and purposes open to those who

10

wish to participate.

11

MR. OLSON:

I think that the other factor

12

that is involved here is that, provided that there is

13

reasonable access to the general election, which is

14

another factor in this case, then the constitutional

15

rights to associate are satisfied.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you think that in

17

Kusper, if -- if there was reasonable access to a

18

general election, you can structure and stifle the

19

primary any way -

20

MR. OLSON:

Well, I think that -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm just looking at the

22

principle here, and it may be that you'll say that

23

there's no burden here, et cetera.

24

know:

25

are entitled and we must look at the fairness of the

But I just want to

Isn't there a constitutional principle that we

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

primary system insofar as participation of the voters?

2

MR. OLSON:

I think that the case that maybe

3

best answers that is the Munro case, in which the State

4

of Washington's practice -- and there was a different

5

practice of the State of Washington before this Court

6

earlier this week.

7

process was that there was an open blanket primary,

8

which was not held unconstitutional at that point, where

9

the major candidates -- the one and two positions of the

But at that point in time the

10

major candidates of each of the political parties would

11

get on the ballot, and then the Socialist Party was

12

complaining because it took 1 percent of the votes of

13

the primary process to get on the general election

14

ballot.

15

This Court held that that -- that that was

16

not an impossible burden, and that -- the principle from

17

that case and the other cases, the American political -

18

American Party of Texas v. White and so forth, the

19

Court's jurisprudence has held that, as long as there is

20

reasonable access for a candidate or a political party

21

to the general election process, then it does not have

22

to be provided in that level in the primary.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it right to

24

regard the election of delegates here as a primary

25

election?
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

My understanding, of course, is that that

2

simply elects -- it doesn't get you on the ballot.

3

elects delegates who then exercise the choice.

4

think our primary election cases are transferable to

5

this situation?

6

MR. OLSON:

It

Do you

Well, I think there are two

7

answers to that.

Your primary election cases talk in

8

terms of, the ones that have been mentioned in the

9

briefs here, talk particularly in terms of protection

10

under the Equal Protection Clause.

11

This is --

it's called a primary, but it's

12

an election of delegates by party members that -- and

13

then, when those delegates get together, they go to the

14

convention.

15

so much difference as this is a process that the State

16

has allowed the party to implement to choose its

17

leadership.

18

no point in the process -

19
20

23

The Court has repeatedly held that there is

JUSTICE SCALIA:
it.

21
22

So I'm not sure that the nomenclature makes

The State has not allowed

The State has required it, no?
MR. OLSON:

Yes, the State requires it, but

it JUSTICE SCALIA:

Although if we -- if we

24

hold it unconstitutional for the State to require it, I

25

suppose it would also be unconstitutional for the State
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

merely to allow it, wouldn't it?

2

selecting judges in any other State, if it has been

3

voluntarily adopted by the party, would be

4

unconstitutional?

5

MR. OLSON:

So that this manner of

That's the principle that the

6

Respondents in the Second Circuit advance.

7

strike down the conventions, because conventions are, by

8

definition, selections of individuals to represent the

9

broader constituency at a subsequent -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It would

Just to make it clear, is

11

it your position that, with reference to this election

12

for delegates, the State can make it as burdensome as it

13

chooses on those who wish to put themselves forward on

14

the ballot as a proposed delegate?

15

MR. OLSON:

I think, Justice Kennedy, as

16

long as the system in the State provides a reasonable

17

access to candidates and political parties to the

18

election process, that there is not a First Amendment

19

right with respect to the primary process or the

20

preliminary process, which in this case includes both

21

the so-called delegate selection primary -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if --

what if it were

23

the parties that objected to this and not some

24

individual who said, I'm not being given enough voice in

25

the party?

What if the parties said, we don't want to
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

select our candidates this way?

2

State could impose it upon them?

3

MR. OLSON:

Is it clear that the

It's clear the State has the

4

right, and this Court has said so in the American Party

5

of Texas v. White, that the State can require either a

6

primary election or a convention.

7

specifically addressed that.

8

said:

9

insist that intraparty competition be settled by primary

10
11

The Court

In fact, what the Court

It is too plain for argument that a State may

or convention.

That's the holding of that Court -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That convention -

12

conventions can come in all sizes and shapes.

13

argument here is that this system shuts out

14

rank-and-file party members and gives the total control

15

to the party leaders, and that the preliminary was the

16

primary or selection of delegates, but it's really a

17

sham because nobody is going to run for that except the

18

party faithful, someone picked by the party boss.

19

The

So the argument on the other side is

20

that this system, as complicated as it is, reduces to

21

the party leaders choose the candidates.

22

MR. OLSON:

Well, what this Court has said

23

in the California Republican Party v. Jones case, a cite

24

quoting the Eu case, the Eu case that the Court had

25

decided before, is that the political party has the
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right to select its leadership, to select its nominating

2

process, to select its candidates, and to exclude

3

members.

4

even arbitrarily, as long as the Fourteenth Amendment is

5

not violated in an election context, to exclude members

6

of its party.

So, Justice Ginsburg, the party has the right,

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the State can

8

restrict that right if it wants to.

9

require the party to select its candidates by -- by

10

primary.

11
12

The State can

MR. OLSON:

By primary or -- or by

convention.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. OLSON:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or by convention.

Right.
But if the State wants to

16

do it by smoke -- if the party wants to do it by

17

smoke-filled room, the State can say, if it wishes to

18

say, you can't do it by smoke-filled room.

19

MR. OLSON:

It can, Justice Scalia, but the

20

State must respect the rights of the political parties

21

in determining who their leaders and candidates must be.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

that's not the issue here.

24

in agreement.

25

MR. OLSON:

Well, but that -- but
The State and the party are

Yes.

Yes.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The State is not trying to

2

coerce the party into doing something that it doesn't

3

want to do.

4

MR. OLSON:

Yes, I totally agree with you.

5

But I'm answering hypothetical questions with respect to

6

something else.

7

Court vigorously protects the special place the First

8

Amendment reserves for the protection by which a party,

9

political party, selects a standard-bearer.

What this Court has said, that this

Selecting a

10

candidate is selecting the person that will communicate

11

the party's interests -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the party is -- you're

13

identifying the party with the party leader because the

14

argument comes down to this is not the rank and file

15

that's making this election; this is the party leader;

16

and the party might like that or the leadership might

17

like that, but the rank and file might not, and the

18

argument is that they have rights of association, too.

19

MR. OLSON:

Well, they have rights of

20

association, but they have -- they have associated in a

21

political party which has elected leadership which makes

22

decisions, Justice Ginsburg.

23

They do not have a right to belong to the

24

Democratic Party or the Republican Party.

25

file, so forth -- the definition of "insurgent," which
11
Alderson Reporting Company

The rank and

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is at the other side of the table here, are people that

2

are rebelling against the duly elected leadership of the

3

political party.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if there is a

5

State-mandated primary, I thought it's basic law that

6

the State may not place unduly restrictive barriers to

7

participation in that primary.

8

it seems to me.

9

Now, tell me if I'm wrong -

MR. OLSON:

10

I think that's a given,

I may be -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then we can argue

11

about whether the burden is too great here, which it may

12

not be.

13

MR. OLSON:

Let me say, Justice Kennedy,

14

that I may be wrong in terms of what this Court's

15

decisions stand for with respect to ultimately allowing,

16

as far as associational rights are concerned,

17

individuals and parties access to the total electorate.

18

But even if your premise is correct that there must be

19

an open access in a reasonable way to either the -- to

20

both the primary and the general election, then this

21

process is reasonable.

22

for a person to participate.

It's not unreasonably difficult

23

Let me say -- let me enumerate the ways.

24

individual, a rank-and-file member, can campaign and

25

vote for delegates.

An individual might become a
12
Alderson Reporting Company

An

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

delegate himself by -- or herself, by getting 500 names

2

on a signature, and that's far below what this Court has

3

indicated before was -- was an acceptable level of

4

requirement of access to the ballot.

5

attempt to form delegate slates, can attempt to persuade

6

the delegates, can -- the individual can form or switch

7

parties.

9

An individual can

In this case the Respondent Lopez Torres,
actually in the 2003 election, became a candidate at the

10

general election for supreme court justice of the

11

Working Families Party, and she did that without giving

12

up her registration and membership in the Democratic

13

Party.

14

Finally, and this is even if she hadn't been able to

15

secure the nomination of that political party, she could

16

run in the general election.

17

takes 3500 to 4,000 signatures to run as an independent

18

body in the general election.

19

She was in that election and she lost.

There's access to -- it

So there is way after way after way for

20

individuals in New York to participate in the election

21

process.

22

So in answer to your question,

23

Justice Kennedy, to the extent that your statement of

24

the principle with respect to access to both the primary

25

and the general election is -- is the law of this Court,
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

then that access exists here.
But I come back to the point that political

3

parties have the greatest possible latitude -- yes,

4

Justice Scalia, that the Court has upheld certain

5

restrictions with respect to how the nominee of the

6

party gets selected.

7

when the party is in that process, its powers and rights

8

and First Amendment freedoms to elect the

9

standard-bearer, to select the standard-bearer, are at

But the Court has also said that

10

their apogee, because the person selected as a

11

candidate, whether that person might be the most

12

favorable person to the rank and file, the duly elected

13

leadership of the political party might decide, well,

14

that person really isn't qualified to be a supreme court

15

justice even -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Have we -- have we imposed

17

any such restrictions on our own, as opposed to merely

18

upholding restrictions that were imposed by the State?

19

That is to say, have we held that the Constitution

20

itself imposes certain restrictions?

21
22
23

MR. OLSON:

Except in the context of

analyzing what State requirements have been?
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

I want a case where

24

the State did not impose the restriction and it was up

25

to us to decide whether the State could do that or not,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

but rather the State said the party can do whatever it

2

wants, and we have disallowed what the party itself

chose under no compulsion from the State -

MR. OLSON:

The only cases that I would

submit, that I'm aware of, that would answer that would

13

be Equal Protection Clause cases, because the -

14

these -- the political party is a group of people that

15

decide to form together because of common beliefs.

7

MR. ROSSMAN:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

I'd like to begin by responding to

10

Justice Kennedy's question regarding the election of

11

delegates and fairness for voters.

12

was conceded below that the requirement for delegates of

15

There are two

And secondly, I would say that in

16

considering that question, Justice Kennedy, the

17

important thing is to consider what is the intended role

18

that the State gives to the participants in this

19

process?

20

voters have the opportunity to vote for local delegates

21

who are to represent their interests at the convention.

22

As Cousins instructs, once they have the opportunity to

23

pull a lever for the delegate that shares their values

24

and their preferences, their right of suffrage is

25

satisfied.

And what the role here is that individual

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

What they do not have, what Respondents and

2

what the lower courts would like to have exist but

3

doesn't exist and isn't required under the Constitution,

4

is the opportunity for rank-and-file voters to vote

5

directly for the candidates at the nomination stage, and

6

that's the difference between a delegate-based

7

convention and a primary.

8

If we agree, and I think the Court would

9

agree, that there is no right to a primary -- that's

10

something, in fact, that's conceded in this case; there

11

is no constitutional right to a primary -- then there is

12

no State requirement that there be a direct opportunity

13

for association between voter and candidate at the

14

nomination phase; that it is perfectly appropriate and

15

constitutional for that association to be between voter

16

and delegate, and the voters then rely on their locally-

17

elected delegates to advance their interest in the

18

convention process.

19

That's the difference between a convention

20

and a primary.

21

the cases -

22

We think it's a critical one here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In practice, how many

23

people other than the slate selected by the party

24

leaders run in New York for this delegate position?

25

MR. ROSSMAN:

So

In New York City, the evidence
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

below was that approximately 12 to 13 percent of

2

delegate slates are contested.

3

the availability of a contest is the key.

4

frequency of the contest, because there's also evidence

5

in the record that for open primaries for civil court,

6

which is the closest parallel, that those are only

7

contested 28 percent of the time.

8
9

What we suggest is that
It's not the

So the fact that an election is not
contested, that there may be voter apathy out there,

10

that there may be party unity that causes people to

11

rally behind the parties and their leadership, is not a

12

constitutional problem.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

The theory of this, I take

14

it, is that, just as you said, voters elect convention

15

delegates, and those convention delegates choose the

16

official nominee, say, of the Democratic Party.

17

nominee goes on to the final ballot.

18

MR. ROSSMAN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that

Correct.
Well, what then of the fact

20

that the convention delegates when they meet won't let

21

people who would like the position of the judge appear

22

before them?

23
24
25

MR. ROSSMAN:

Well, that is not the general

MR. ROSSMAN:

But even if it is, the

important thing is not that individual candidates appear

to politic before the delegates, it's that delegates

have the freedom under the statute to vote for whatever

candidate they like.

at the convention because it would be unseemly for them

to do so.

There's evidence that there's

words, if that's the intent of this statute, then you

12

have a statute that's designed on the one hand to have

13

convention delegates who will choose, and on the other

14

hand to prevent the convention delegates from finding

15

out the qualifications of the different applicants, in

which case it would seem to be a statute that would give

In other words, go ahead.

MR. ROSSMAN:

Let me respond to the most

22

difficult part of your question first, which is the

23

constitutionality of the party leader selecting a

24

candidate we think is not troublesome at all.

25

there are many instances in New York and in other States

Alderson Reporting Company

In fact,

1

where the political leaders, through their structure, do

2

pick the candidates, for example in the case of vacancy

3

election, which this Court upheld as constitutional in

4

the Rodriquez case.

5

But the question that I think that you're

6

asking is, is there some denial of voter or delegate

7

education, and does that pose a constitutional problem?

8

We have here a bare statutory framework and the

9

statutory framework does not in any way, shape, or form

10

preclude the ability of delegates to become educated

11

about the candidates.

12

framework.

13

contend is core associational activity protected by the

14

First Amendment, participate in their own way of

15

choosing in educating delegates and in putting forth the

16

candidacies of judicial -- potential judicial nominees.

17

Within that bare statutory

The parties themselves, through what we

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose that the

18

State can make the judgment that it's more likely that

19

the delegates would be informed about the qualifications

20

of candidates for judgeship than voters?

21

MR. ROSSMAN:

In fact, we think that is the

22

very judgment that the State has made here.

23

as Mr. Olson said, when it went from a primary to a

24

convention process, the idea behind it in part was that

25

the delegates could be more educated, would be expected
21
Alderson Reporting Company

And when,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to be more educated than rank-and-file voters would be

2

about judges.

3

rank-and-file voters are not educated hardly at all

4

about the judge candidates that they select.

5

think this is clearly a legislative sensible policy

6

choice to put the selection process in the hands of

7

those who have the motivation and the opportunity to

8

become more educated about those that they're selecting.

9

And the evidence in this case is that

So we

Now, one thing that needs to be recalled in

10

this process is, of course, it is not merely a State-run

11

election.

12

party affair, too.

13

rights of the parties themselves that attach.

14

As -- as the Court observed in Jones, it is a
So there are core First Amendment

And the question -- I think in response to

15

Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there's

16

confusion between the party leaders and the parties, it

17

is our reading of the Eu, Tashjian and Jones cases that

18

the Court has recognized that parties have a structure

19

and have the core constitutional right to create their

20

own structure, and their leadership can make choices for

21

the parties.

So they can choose to endorse candidates,

22

for example.

They can choose to associate or not

23

associate with particular individuals.

24

choice that's made here by duly elected leaders of the

25

parties.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

And that's a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And if there's a problem with that, the

2

remedy for that problem is in the political arena.

3

remedy is for the rank-and-file voters to vote their

4

party leaders out when they come up for election if they

5

adopt a process that they don't like or they think

6

squelches the input of the rank-and-file members.

7

The

So the reason that -- the reason why that's

8

not happening here, we believe, could be attributable to

9

one of two things.

It could be attributable to apathy,

10

which the Constitution does not have a prerogative to

11

stamp out, or it could be attributable to party unity

12

and the fact that leaders are sensitive to who will be

13

best to advance the interests of their rank-and-file

14

members.

15

problem with that.

16

But we don't think there's a constitutional

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if the autonomy of

17

the party and, let's say, the leader is the

18

justification for this, the party -- how -- how

19

autonomous can a party be when it's told, even if you

20

want to be more democratic about how you choose your

21

candidates, you can't because New York is forcing this

22

system on you?

23

MR. ROSSMAN:

The burden

And that burden is -- is focused on two

18

points:

number one, the entrenched power of the

19

political bosses; and number two, the difficulty -

20

well, I guess three points -- the difficulty of

21

fielding, for a dissident to field a whole slate of

22

candidates who in effect, once elected, would make the

23

nomination desired; or, three, the capacity of the

Now, I think your -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it's still the case

4

that at the end of the day, the nub of your claim is

5

that the intending judicial candidate cannot effectively

6

politic, does not have a reasonable chance of getting

7

selected; and I don't see that as a -- as a direct

8

ballot access claim.

9

Let me put the question in another way:

10

Your -- your friend on the other side, Mr. Rossman, in

response to a question, said that if this election of

12

the judicial candidate for the party were made directly

13

by the political bosses, whatever their titles are, the

14

ones who are supposedly in control here, he would not

15

see any constitutional objection to that.

16

What if New York had a system that provided

17

precisely for that?

understand it, get elected every 2 years and the State

law would provide that those party bosses, whatever

20

their title is, would in fact select the candidate.

However, on the statute that I think you

4

MR. SCHWARZ:

Well, the -- first, on the

5

consent of the party leaders, which is really what we

6

have here, of course they are -- they like the system

7

because the State system entrenches them.

8

And -- and this Court -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

Well, the Federal system in

practice entrenches United States Senators.

11

I'm -- I'm not sure that, in terms of

12

political participation on the part of an intending or

13

an aspiring judge that the system that I suggested in

the hypo, in which the party bosses select the nominee,

15

is for constitutional purposes significantly different

16

from the Federal system for -- for picking district

for delegates.

Okay.

But isn't your

argument still that, because there is a limitation on

5

the participation of the intending judicial candidate,

6

there is ultimately a constitutional problem?

7

So let me pose a different question to you,

8

and this one is not hypothetical.

The nub of your case

9

is that the political bosses in effect are controlling

10

the process because they tell the delegates who to vote

11

for.

12

whom you represent have any difficulty in getting to the

13

political bosses and saying:

MR. SCHWARZ:

Yes.

They would not listen to

17

declined to hire an unqualified person as your law

18

clerk.

19

We won't listen to you in this

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure.

They -- for

20

political reasons, they're saying:

21

There are -- there are a lot of people who go to United

22

States Senators, and the United States Senators say:

23

Scram; we don't -- we don't like you; your politics

24

aren't good enough for us.

really, the question here is if you have a statute that

makes it difficult for the voters to participate, to

25

have a voice.

That's really the question.
37

It's -

And if I

could use something that the Board of Elections' brief

2

conceded in both their reply and their opening brief,

3

they said a person -- they said that party members who

wanted to attempt to assemble a slate to try to

influence the decision at the convention would be "well

served" -- that's their exact words -- to assemble and

run a slate.

I don't see why that would be unconstitutional.
MR. SCHWARZ:

I'm not sure I have a position

3

on that one way or the other.

What I do say, though, is

4

this Court in your Minnesota Republican Party v. White

5

decision said it makes -- and, you know, the question of

6

whether judges should be elected or appointed is a

7

controversial question.

8

said that if you're going to have an election -- and

9

here we have elections for delegates -- if you're going

But this Court in that decision

10

to have an election, you shouldn't structure that

11

election in a way that makes it in that case extremely

12

difficult or impossible or forbidden -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Schwarz, you're

14

talking about the election of the judge or the election

15

of the delegate?

16

apples there.

17

I think you're mixing two oranges and

MR. SCHWARZ:

Well, the -- I do believe that

18

the election of the delegates raises the constitutional

19

questions about has the State put its thumb on the

20

scale, has the State done something that severely

21

burdens the voters.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It -- the evidence shows

23

the thumb on the scale is just as strong as if the party

24

chairman picked the delegates.

25

to me, it presents the question of whether it would be

And, therefore, it seems

39

unconstitutional to enact a statute that allows the

2

party chairman to pick the delegates.

MR. SCHWARZ:

I'm not sure, Your Honor.
Well, if you're not sure,

it's difficult -

JuSTICE KENNEDY:

If I could interrupt,

Justice Breyer, for just a moment.

But in the Minnesota

8

case the thumb on the scale was to deprive the

9

constituents of a First Amendment right.

Smith v.

10

Allwright, it was a right not to be discriminated

11

against race.

12

substantive right?

13

Here what we're asking is:

MR. SCHWARZ:

What is the

Well, I think here it is the

14

right not to be burdened, severely burdened, in an

15

election.

16

And that just runs through all your cases JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but what you are

17

calling -- and correct me if I am wrong.

Maybe I

18

misunderstand this.

19

severe burden is the difficulty of assembling a whole

20

slate that can control the meeting or have a majority in

21

the ultimate meeting of that delegate, of those

22

delegates, and therefore actually select the candidate

23

who wants to put the slate together.

24

over result rather than the capacity of any individual

25

to get elected a delegate which I think you are

I think what you are calling the

40
Alderson Reporting Company

And it's control

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

objecting to.

2

Am I wrong?

MR. SCHWARZ:

We have never said that

3

there's a right to win.

4

right to meaningfully participate.

5

We have only said there's a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but when you say

6

"meaningfully participate" you talk about putting -- and

7

candidly talk about putting -- a slate of delegates

8

together.

9

If I put a slate of delegates together, it

10

is because once those delegates are selected they're

11

going to support me; and that's why it -- I think your

12

real argument is not that somebody has difficulty

13

becoming a candidate for a delegate or even getting

14

elected one.

15

that it's hard for the intending judicial candidate to

16

assemble a large enough group of people to give that

17

candidate success once the delegates are elected.

18

a success argument that you are making, not an access

19

argument.

20

The difficulty that you're claiming is

MR. SCHWARZ:

No.

It's

It's a compete argument,

21

not an access argument.

And I do think the Constitution

22

should be read to say that if the State passes laws that

23

make it very hard for voters to band together or for

24

insurgent candidates to compete, then -- and it is a

25

severe burden, they have to justify it.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

And, by the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

way, they haven't sought in their papers to justify it.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could a State decide it

3

doesn't want candidates to have any part in this

4

delegate-selection process?

5

have would-be judges engage in that kind of activity.

6

So it structures the system that says that they choose

7

delegates for a convention, but we don't want those

8

delegates to be the delegates of any particular

9

candidate.

We want to insulate this process from

10

would-be candidate influence.

11

unconstitutional?

12

It thinks it's unseemly to

MR. SCHWARZ:

Would that be

The problem is that in the

13

real world the statutes work to entrench the power of

14

the party leaders and to prevent voters from, to use the

15

Board of Elections' reply brief, I think, on page 5, to

16

use -- or 17, to use -- the voters are not able to band

17

together to try and influence the results at the

18

conventions.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course not.

You're

20

really arguing against the whole purpose this scheme,

21

which is not to have judges popularly elected.

22

you're saying no, we want them popularly elected.

23

purpose of the scheme is to -- is to have the people

Of course it works the way you say it does.

MR. SCHWARZ:

It's a basic judgment

We -- we have no problem with

the convention, but we don't think that the -- either

10

the insurgent candidate or the band of voters who wish

11

to support that person should be, by the State, fenced

12

out, severely burdened from attempting to -

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
I take it, if they don't prevail?

15

MR. SCHWARZ:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's all right,
For example -

Yes.
-- the other side

17

says that your argument is -- is implicated whenever a

18

convention leads to a different nominee than the

19

primary.

20

MR. SCHWARZ:

No, that's -- that's not -

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't think

22

there's anything wrong with the convention deciding that

23

the nominee is going to be someone other than the person

24

who would prevail in the primary election.

25

MR. SCHWARZ:

There is nothing wrong with
43

Alderson Reporting Company

that, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's all right to

fence them out to that extent?
MR. SCHWARZ:

If you want -- if we want to

5

call that fencing.

6

the -- if the convention is one that is put together

7

without the State burdening the ability for people to

8

get involved -

9

I don't call that fencing.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's

I take it, in

10

evaluating the burden, we should look at how difficult

11

it is for someone to be elected a delegate.

12

MR. SCHWARZ:

I think you should also look

13

at the -- since the party leaders run slates and they

14

have no difficulty in running slates because -- for

15

various reasons that the courts found, I think you

16

should look at the question of slates as well as

17

individual delegates.

18

delegates, I do think that Mr. Dunne's amicus brief

19

which describes, on his page 19, indicates that, you

20

know, it's -- it's a little unrealistic to think that

21

anybody other than -

And in considering individual

because Mr. Dunne was not supported by the party members

do to become on the ballot for delegate?

that's a sufficient burden, do you lose?

case, if you don't think that's sufficient burden.

19

you think -

20
21
22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If

But the State -- the trial

court didn't find that that was a burden.
MR. SCHWARZ:

No, I -- I'm not -- I'm

23

agreeing with the Chief Justice that I think that, if

24

you thought that just running for one delegate slot was

25

sufficient to solve the problem of a State statute that
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was designed -- their words, their admission -- to

2

entrench the power of the party leaders, I think that

3

gives us a problem.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

I mean I don't see

5

how you avoid answering Justice Stevens's hypothetical?

6

The reason I think you have to answer it is because the

7

New York system is the system he described in the

8

hypothetical, with a safety valve.

9
10

MR. SCHWARZ:

The safety valve being?

JUSTICE BREYER:

The safety valve being that

11

the party leaders cannot just choose anybody.

12

if it looks they're going to choose something really

13

nutty, then there will be opposition to these delegates

14

and something will happen.

15

MR. SCHWARZ:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17
18

I mean,

Well So they have leeway, but

you can't go too far.
MR. SCHWARZ:

The record, Your Honor, and

19

this is an extensive record, shows that the party

20

leaders can choose and do choose people who are, to use

21

your word, who are -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't like that.

23

That's why I say you have to answer it.

24

that that's so terrible, then you say no, the

25

Constitution forbids that, though you'd have to explain,
46
Alderson Reporting Company

If you feel

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wouldn't you, why, with all its faults, that is not

2

better in the judgment of New York than a system where

3

people raise $4 million from the lawyers in order to run

4

for office?

5

MR. SCHWARZ:

We -- no, we -- we have not

6

said that there needs to be a primary.

7

that.

8

that we have said that.

And sometimes our opponents leave the impression

9
10
11

We haven't said

We haven't said that.

You know, there are -- get rid of the
leaders JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the -- that's the

12

remedy that, the temporary remedy, that you sought was

13

-- at the bottom line, the court's order was, until New

14

York reacts to this decision, the candidates will be

15

chosen by primary.

16

MR. SCHWARZ:

Yes, the -- but the judge,

17

Your Honor -- the judge did two things in imposing that

18

remedy, three or four things actually:

19

He said, first, I'm not going to

20

micromanage.

21

I'm not going to get into all the details of fixing it

22

because the Legislature should do that and the Federal

23

courts shouldn't do that.

24
25

I think the statutes are unconstitutional.

Second, he relied on the fact that the
fall-back position in the State statutes is there is a
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

primary if there is no other system in place.

2

But, third and most important, he stayed his

3

decision to give the Legislature time to address the

4

question, and they were well on their way to addressing

5

it when this Court gave us the opportunity to be here.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you agree it's

7

not realistic that one way they would address it is by

8

having an entirely appointed system?

9

MR. SCHWARZ:

10

to do that.

11
12

No, they -- they're entitled

MR. SCHWARZ:

I know they are

Well, the As a practical

matter, is that a realistic option in New York?

16

MR. SCHWARZ:

If you look at the amicus

17

briefs filed in our favor, the State bar, the City bar,

18

the Fund for the Modern Courts, the City of New York all

(Laughter.)

2

MR. SCHWARZ:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, not I thought I read a

4

representation somewhere in the briefs that it's

5

unrealistic to expect that New York would move to an

6

entirely appointive system.

7

you're successful, the options will either be direct

8

election of judges or a pure convention with no role for

9

the voters at all.

MR. SCHWARZ:

No, it could be a role for the

voters that does not burden them in the way this statute

burdens them.

of all worlds.

1

think it was, in the Feerick Report that said, the worst

2

thing in the world would be to return us to the primary

3

system this system was intended to replace.

4

MR. SCHWARZ:

Yes, the -- actually the

5

Feerick report, which found that the party leaders all

6

over State however have always made the picks, they

7

voiced a favoring amending the law.

8

the law needs to be amended.

9

They -- they think

And Chief Judge Kaye, in her remarks after

10

the decisions came down and after the Feerick Commission

11

report came out, said the problems that had been

12

revealed in this case are pervasive both systemically

13

and geographically.

14

The Feerick Commission's view is that,

15

unless there's public financing, in which case they'd

16

favor some more involvement by the voters, is simply

17

amend the portions of the law that make it so burdensome

18

on competitors, on voters.

19

We're -- we're neutral.

We just say this

20

law is unconstitutional.

is up to the Legislature, but that it should be amended

With respect to the Kusper case,

That -- that case focused on the fact that the statute

was inhibiting the rights of an individual who wanted to

22

prevented both the individual and the association from

MR. OLSON:

that it was -- it was -- part of that is answered by

conceive of how that would be unconstitutional.

20

If the parties wanted to select the

delegates or select the candidates to be their standard

bearers, that seems to me to be perfectly within the

right of an association to do; and would be perfectly

one more preliminary point.

11

York.

12

case of 90 percent of the congressional districts in

13

this country, which are said not to be competitive.

14

in New York, six sitting judges testified in -- in -- in

15

the lower court that they successfully lobbied delegates

16

to, you know, to be candidates.

17

It is competitive in New

It may not be perfectly competitive, as is the

But

So that happens.

Between 1900 and 2002, this is appendix 130,

18

nearly one fourth of the general elections in New York

19

were competitive.

20

Lopez Torres, the Respondent, received 25

21

votes at the 2002 judicial selection convention, and

22

many of the districts in New York are not dominated by a

23

single party.

24
25

So the final point is it is important to
emphasize this is a -- a challenge on its face to the
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute that simply creates a delegate election and it

2

then creates a convention.

3

can possibly be constitutional, and so what the

4

Respondents are complaining about is what party bosses

5

do.

6

Neither of those provisions

But on page 38 of their brief, they state

7

categorically that the constitutional offense is not the

8

fact that party leaders act as one would expect in

9

choosing nominees.

10

In other words, they act -- party leaders act like party

11

leaders and exercise their influence.

They're not

12

saying that that's unconstitutional.

What they're

13

saying is that a statute that allows party leaders to be

14

party leaders, to be constitutional, to act in ways

15

which are not only permissible under the Constitution as

16

they knowledge, but constitutionally protected, is

17

somehow constitutional.

18

with any of this Court's jurisprudence, which says that

19

political parties must have the maximum opportunity to

20

select their leadership.

That simply is not consistent
