ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. CARVIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The board is unique among Federal regulatory

13

agencies in that the President can neither appoint nor

14

remove its members, nor does he have any ability to

15

designate the chairman or review the work product, so he

16

is stripped of the traditional means of control that he

17

has over the traditional independent agencies.

18

On the other side of the balancing test,

19

Congress provided no reason for stripping him of these

20

traditional means of control.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why do you call it an

22

independent regulatory agency?

I mean, Congress wanted

23

it to be independent of the profession.

24

clear.

25

so why are you characterizing it as an independent

That much is

It didn't want it to be independent of the SEC,

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

regulatory agency?

2

MR. CARVIN:

Justice Ginsburg, by making it

3

public, it made it free of the accounting profession.

4

So then the next question is:

5

same relationship between this agency and the President

6

that the FCC and SEC have?

7

Why didn't they have the

And, in those instances, the President can

8

appoint and remove the members.

9

that here?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. CARVIN:

Now, why didn't they do

But the --

There was -The SEC doesn't have

14

FCC, the other independent regulatory commissions, but

15

this is a board that has a relationship with the SEC,

16

where it can't do anything that doesn't have the SEC's

17

approval.

18

I mean, the SEC is set up like the

There is a buffer between the

19

President and the board, and that's called the SEC, and

8

what happened to the Petitioners here.

There is no

9

mechanism in the statute, in any way, shape, or form,

10

for the SEC to stop an inspection or investigation as it

11

is ongoing.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What happened to the

13

Petitioners here?

14

happened to the Petitioners here, certainly it would be

15

a question of how you would have to do that.

16

17

here you are bringing a facial challenge and you say,

18

never mind any particular proceedings; the whole thing

19

is no good.

No, no, and I'm dealing with

22

Petitioner or for anyone else, there is no mechanism --

23

no existing mechanism for the SEC, in any way, to say

24

25

Equally important --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When you say "no existing

mechanism," could the SEC adopt a rule that would give

2

the SEC authority to -- to stop it?

3

MR. CARVIN:

No, it couldn't, and -- but I

4

think the main point is, Your Honor, it hasn't, and

5

since it hasn't, it doesn't have that authority now.

rule.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

19
20

Yes, and right now it cannot,

It cannot issue such a

rule?

21

MR. CARVIN:

Absolutely not.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. CARVIN:

Why not?

Well, the provision they point

24

to, 7217(d)(1), says it can relieve the board of

25

responsibility, but there is nothing in the statute that
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

gives the SEC to conduct the board's statutory duties.

2

For example, it couldn't say, we will now

3

collect the fees that are going to the board, we will

4

now conduct the registration that's going to the board.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why -- why isn't this

6

simply relieving the board of responsibility, saying,

7

you no longer have responsibility for -- for

8

investigation and inspection in these areas?

9
10
11

MR. CARVIN:

But that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They could do that,

couldn't they?

12

MR. CARVIN:

13

could, my major point is it can't --

14
15
16

No, it can't.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
whether it can't or not.
MR. CARVIN:

But even if it

Well, let's talk about

Why can't it?
All right.

If you turn to 39

17

and 40a of the board's appendix, at the back of the red

18

brief, the board's brief, it walks you through the

19

statutes we have been talking about.

20

And at the bottom of 39a, that's 7217(d)(1),

21

and that's where it says it can relieve the board of

22

responsibilities.

23

And I have two points on that.

One is there's nothing in here that gives

24

the SEC the power to assume the responsibility.

25

simply says the board need not comply with that
7
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

obligation.

2

My second point is:

This doesn't stop the

3

board from doing something.

4

of the responsibility to give me a brief tomorrow, I

haven't told him he can't do it.

that would be -JUSTICE SCALIA:

When you no longer have

14

responsibility to perform a government -- governmental

15

act, you no longer have authority to perform it.

16

MR. CARVIN:

17

that would be an arguable principle.

18

the next page, 40a, you see a very specific provision in

19

the statute that talks about how they can impose

20

limitations on the board.

21

If you viewed it in isolation,

without reasonable justification or excuse.

2

So Congress has established very serious

3

barriers to the SEC even limiting the board's

4

responsibilities.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, they don't have to --

6

they can't issue a subpoena without the board's

7

approval, I take it -- the commission's approval.

8
9
10

MR. CARVIN:

They have very serious

information-gathering powers totally distinct from the
board.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. CARVIN:

What?

Any -- any person who is a

13

registered association or anyone who is associated with

14

them has to provide documents, witness testimony, wholly

15

apart from a subpoena, so anyone who is within the

16

regulatory --

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. CARVIN:

Or they will suffer the

sanctions that are listed in the statute.
JUSTICE BREYER:

change the sanctions?

MR. CARVIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm talk about the

So as far as -- if the

6

company was ever certain it was right and that the

7

Accounting Board was out of control, completely wrong,

8

the company would just say:

9

MR. CARVIN:

I'm not complying --

Well -- but --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. CARVIN:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- fine, do what you want.

But -And then at that moment,

13

the group that would decide whether they were right or

14

the board was right would be the commission; is that

15

right?

16

MR. CARVIN:

Well, I don't think there ever

17

would be a dispute about whether or not they would have

18

access to their documents and their testimony, because

19

it's written right in the statute --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

It says you don't -- you

21

can get it even without a subpoena?

MR. CARVIN:

MR. CARVIN:

I think there are

10

certain confidentiality restrictions as part of their

11

investigative and inspection thing.

12

normal kind of inspection, where you go through the

13

investigation and they would review the various

14

documents.

15

It's -- it's the

And my -- but my basic point is that that is

16

a very serious burden on American citizens.

17

something that is totally outside the SEC's control.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. CARVIN:

of compliance?

20

That is

I'm sorry.
The burden is because it's

difficult and expensive to comply?
MR. CARVIN:

That would be one.

9

those similarly situated.

10

MR. CARVIN:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
There's the cost of

12

compliance.

13

inherent in the power of the board unmonitored,

14

unchecked by the SEC, to investigate?

15

What other harms or dangers or risks are

MR. CARVIN:

You're right, Your Honor.

The

16

burden here is the burden that Mr. Olson suffered in

17

Morrison v. Olson.

18

19

subject to a burdensome investigation and that is the

20

burden that affects American citizens that is beyond the

have certain responsibilities?

25

MR. CARVIN:

You are suggesting

No, obviously they do.
14

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

what I'm -- you were asking for -- I'm now trying to

2

describe the relationship between the SEC and the board,

3

and the one difference between the normal employer-

4

employee relationship is that the board has statutory

5

authority wholly distinct from the principal.

6

Number two, if that subordinate didn't do

7

things the way the principal wanted in the employment

8

situation, the principal could fire the subordinate.

9

When can the SEC fire the board in these circumstances?

10

Only when they have committed gross abuses and after

11

notice and opportunity for a hearing.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if you have a statute

13

that says each Department -- Commerce, Justice -- the

14

Attorney General of the United States or the secretary

15

shall appoint an inspector general who will in fact

16

inspect and find ethics violations and that office -- he

17

cannot be removed from that office without cause.

19

unconstitutional.

the difference?
MR. CARVIN:

Well, two differences.
15

Alderson Reporting Company

One is

Official

1

the -- the Secretary of the Interior is the President's

2

alter ego, and so, therefore, the President --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you are saying that

4

the -- the chairman of the SEC does not under the

5

Constitution have the authority or the SEC does not have

6

the authority to appoint individuals who cannot be

7

removed without cause?

8
9

MR. CARVIN:

Well, I think there is two

points.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Or -- or you might

11

be saying they do not have the authority to appoint

12

inferior officers of the United States.

13

why they wouldn't have that authority if the Secretary

14

of the Interior has that authority.

15

4

what would be unconstitutional about that.

5

MR. CARVIN:

I can't imagine
What?

Well, Your Honor, if the

6

President called up the head of the SEC and said, I want

7

you to seek sanctions against the chairman of Exxon,

8

under the traditional understanding of Humphrey's

9

Executor the SEC commissioner would not be beholden to

10

follow the President's direction.

11

The same would be true if he called him up

12

and said, fire the chairman of the PCAOB.

13

is so, then the President has no ability to remove

14

somebody exercising a very important executive function,

15

and unless we are going to rewrite what has been

16

generally understood as the independence of -- of

17

independent agencies, then there is a fundamental

18

difference between the President's ability to fire an

19

inferior officer at the Justice Department and fire an

20

inferior officer at the independent agency.

argument, he cannot control, for example, the

7

Scalia asked earlier, I don't think it's a statutory

8

principle that you pretend --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it unconstitutional

10

for the President not to be able to appoint an inferior

11

officer?

12

MR. CARVIN:

Not an inferior officer.

13

of course, these are principal officers for three

reasons --

16

your characterization of them?

19

MR. CARVIN:

But,

Assuming we don't accept

Then I have two other

arguments, Your Honor.
One is:

The SEC cannot be a department

20

under Freytag, because it is an independent agency

21

indistinguishable from the Tax Court.

22

the Freytag majority opinion said was, if you are unlike

23

a cabinet department because you are not subject to

24

political oversight, then --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -- and what

I hope your case doesn't

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rest on Freytag.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. CARVIN:

So do I.

I want to take an

4

opportunity to focus on the real point of Freytag, which

5

was made very eloquently in the Freytag dissenting

6

opinion, which was --

7

(Laughter.)

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. CARVIN:

And the brief.

The Appointments Clause is

11

designed to achieve accountability, and even when you

12

are not talking about presidential advice and consent

13

positions, the way we achieve that accountability is by

14

vesting it, in the words of the dissenting opinion, in

15

"the President's direct lieutenant."

16

important because it makes the President accountable for

17

those positions, and it also makes them able to resist

18

congressional encroachments.

And that's very

19

And this scheme, besides, embodies precisely

20

the evil that was condemned by every member of the Court

21

in Freytag and in Edmond, which is it creates an

22

unaccountable system where a multi-member commission

23

beyond the President's political oversight and control

24

is making appointments.

25

in the President or the Senate, has any influence who --

Not one elected representative,

Yes, so what are -- so

what are the heads of the various divisions of the SEC?
MR. CARVIN:

The board and the SEC say they

are not inferior officers, because they do not under

15

Freytag have any specific statutory authorization.

16

are not, in the words of the Appointments Clause,

17

"established by law."

18

They

So if they are --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

commissions that have jobs comparable to people who are

21

22

MR. CARVIN:

Yes.

23

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CARVIN:

There are two differences.

2

is, for those lower-level people within the executive

3

departments, they have specific statutory creation of

4

those offices, the Solicitor General on down.

5

no statute saying that anybody below the commission

6

level at the SEC has any job.

7

There is

That's totally up to the discretion of the

8

commission.

9

they want or not.

10

They can vest them with whatever authority

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but the question is

11

-- I assume it's the follow-up question that Justice

12

Ginsburg is interested in -- under your view of the

13

case, why is that lawful?

14

One

MR. CARVIN:

No, it would only be unlawful

15

if they were inferior officers.

16

correct that they are not inferior officers, there would

17

be no constitutional problem at all with the SEC, for

18

example, appointing a general counsel.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if the board is

I should --

I don't understand that.

20

It's okay for them to appoint principal officers, but

21

not inferior officers?

MR. CARVIN:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. CARVIN:

25

No, no.
Oh.

Employees, Your Honor.
Oh, I see.

And the argument for them being

employees that the board has advanced is that they're -26
Alderson Reporting Company

3

that they're -JUSTICE SCALIA:

You really had me scared there.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. CARVIN:

6
7

I wish you had said that.

If I am scaring you, I'm not

doing my job.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're saying they are not

8

inferior officers and also not principal officers, but

9

merely employees?

10

MR. CARVIN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12
13

Merely employees.
And who appoints -- who

appoints the inferior officers at the -- at the SEC?
MR. CARVIN:

Well, that's my other point.

14

The chairman does, and so if you accept their view of

15

who the head of the department is, which is the

16

commission --

17
18
19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All those appointments are

presumably invalid.
MR. CARVIN:

-- all those appointments are

unconstitutional, so under their theory --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. CARVIN:

That would be a shame.

-- since the chairman didn't

23

appoint any -- the general counsel, the heads of any of

24

the departments, all of them are unconstitutional.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does the chairman serve as

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a chairman for a fixed term?

2

MR. CARVIN:

Not as chairman.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. CARVIN:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No?

Okay.

He just has -So, therefore, what you had

6

said before would not apply to the chairman, that is

7

to say:

The President can remove him at will --

8

MR. CARVIN:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Not -There is no statute to the

10

contrary; he does not serve for a fixed term, and so you

11

cannot imply that.

Since the chairman cannot --

12

MR. CARVIN:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But this statute doesn't --- can remove him at will

14

-- you do not have what you would call the gearing into

15

play, this somewhat mechanical jurisprudence, of what's

16

an independent agency.

17

MR. CARVIN:

No, he can remove the chairman

18

at his pleasure, which -- but not a commissioner.

19

that's our whole point.

20

And

That's a very key point.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you are saying that the

21

chairman, not the commissioner, is the person who does

22

the appointing?
MR. CARVIN:

23
24
25

opposite.

We argue that.

Under the statute -JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

28
Alderson Reporting Company

They argue the

Official

1

MR. CARVIN:

-- the commissioner does the

2

appointing.

3

President exercises such extraordinary control over the

4

chairman and therefore is able to control the SEC staff,

5

Congress, in the statute, took away that traditional

6

enforcement mechanism.

7

And that's our key point.

Because the

All of the SEC staff you were referring to

8

earlier, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg, are the

9

chairman's alter egos.

And since they are the

10

chairman's alter egos, they are completely

11

constitutional.

12

chairman's powers, which was a way of limiting the

13

President's ability to control the board.

14
15

And Congress, again, took away the

And I think they -- but our basic
observation --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So this whole thing would

17

be constitutional if, instead of giving the appointing

18

power to the commission, they had given it to the

19

chairman?

20

MR. CARVIN:

No, because we believe they are

21

principal officers for three reasons under Edmond:

22

run their own shop; the commission has no control over

23

the officers on the board, since it can only remove them

24

in these extraordinarily narrow situations; and as we

25

have discussed at length before, it can only review part

policies that the SEC absolutely abhors and thinks are

6

completely counterproductive, but under this

7

extraordinarily narrow removal provision --

Isn't that a highly

these two are working in harmony.

11

MR. CARVIN:

Well, it would work perfectly

if the board was an independent, autonomous entity that

was not subject to the plenary control of the SEC, and

14

that's exactly how the Senate report described it.

15

No, the New York Stock Exchange works

16

perfectly fine even though the SEC has oversight

17

responsibility over the New York Stock Exchange directly

18

analogous to the oversight responsibility it has over

19

the board.

20

you followed the congressional scheme, which was an

21

agency with its own autonomy and power.

22

And so, no, it would work perfectly fine if

And since it is an agency that has its own

23

revenue sources, its own statutory authority, it has to

24

be an agency composed of principal officers.

25

very powerful agencies, including the CIA, for example,
30

Elsewise

would be considered inferior officers simply because in

2

an organizational chain they report to some others.

3

And I would argue, to get back to my

4

original point, Justice Scalia, that that would

5

absolutely confound the accountability that the Framers

6

insisted upon, that either the President and the Senate

7

or a direct lieutenant of the President make the kinds

8

of appointments of inferior officers and that the

9

important officers go through the advice and consent

10

process.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNITED STATES
GENERAL KAGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Resolution of this case follows from a

22

simple syllogism, and it is this:

The President has

23

constitutionally sufficient control over the SEC; the

24

SEC has comprehensive control over the Accounting Board;

25

therefore, the President has constitutionally sufficient
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

control over the Accounting Board.

2

Now, Mr. Carvin has suggested that there ­-

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

The President

4

has adequate control over the SEC only because he can

5

dismiss the chairman of the SEC.

6

is not governed by the chairman of the SEC.

7

role whatever for the chairmanship.

8

governance of this board is by the members of the SEC.

9

So that's quite different from saying -- you know, I --

10
11

But the activity here
There's no

The -- the

I think your syllogism breaks down at that point.
GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I -- I think not,

12

Justice Scalia.

Humphrey's Executor said 70 years ago

13

the President does have constitutionally sufficient

14

control over the SEC generally, including the chair.

15

Now, the SEC has constitutionally -- has

16

comprehensive control over the Accounting Board.

17

is nothing that the Accounting --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There

The chairman, which is --

19

which is -- which is the -- what should I say -- the

20

knife that the President has into the SEC, has no role

21

in the control of this board.

22

GENERAL KAGAN:

The -- the chair has the

23

same role that he has with respect to pretty much

24

everything else that the SEC does.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
32
Alderson Reporting Company

The SEC -No.

I thought the

Official

1

employees were appointed by the chairman, not by the

2

commission.

3
4

GENERAL KAGAN:

Subject to the control --

subject to the approval of the commission.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So --

So you think -- you

6

think a -- a veto power is the same as an original --

7

original power?

8
9

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, in fact, the

commission could do the exact same thing in this case.

10

The commission could delegate its control over the

11

Accounting Board to the chair, subject to the control of

12

the commission again.

13

So I think that there is no difference with

14

respect to the SEC's supervision of the board than there

15

is with respect to the SEC's supervision of any of its

16

other functions or any --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

GENERAL KAGAN:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's say --

-- of its staff.
Let's say that

20

the -- let's say that the board issues -- demands

21

documents from a particular company.

22

them not to do that?
GENERAL KAGAN:

23

Can the SEC direct

The SEC has full control

24

over the investigative and inspection function of the

25

board.

This was what Mr. Carvin -- was the one thing
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that Mr. Carvin said the SEC lacked, but in fact it does

2

not, because the board's investigations and the board's

3

inspections are all done according to rule.

4

in a number of ways can change those rules.

5

And the SEC

The SEC can reach out and abrogate any board

6

rules, including rules relating to inspections and

7

investigations.

8

its own rules, if --

9

The SEC also has power to promulgate

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me, but, you know,

10

Congress -- Congress can change the statutory authority

11

of any agency just like that.

12

Congress is controlling the agency?

13

GENERAL KAGAN:

Does that mean that

Well, it's certainly part of

14

Congress's control mechanisms.

15

of the SEC's control mechanisms with relation to the

16

Accounting Board.

17

And this, too, is part

The Accounting Board can take no --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure that -- that

18

the ability to take away responsibility for an agency --

19

from an agency is the same as controlling what

20

authority that agency does exercise.

21

they are two different things.
GENERAL KAGAN:

22

It seems to me

And I think that the SEC has

23

both.

It certainly has the authority to take away

24

responsibility from the Accounting Board.

25

rescission provision in 7217 makes that completely
34
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

clear.

2

rules by which the Accounting Board does anything and

3

everything.

4

rule and say all inspections have to be approved by us,

5

all investigations.

6

But it also has authority to set the ground

It can say tomorrow -- it can promulgate a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Will that be

7

consistent -- do you think that will be consistent with

8

the intent of Congress in establishing the PCAOB?

9

GENERAL KAGAN:

I -- I do think it would be

10

consistent with the intent of Congress,

11

Mr. Chief Justice, because the intent of Congress was to

12

place the Accounting Board under the extremely close and

13

comprehensive supervision of the SEC.

14

independence that one finds throughout the legislative

15

record here are almost all references to independence

16

from the accounting industry, not from the SEC.

17
18

The references to

Quite to the contrary, Congress made it
clear -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

Why did -- just out

20

of -- I guess maybe it's not important, but why did

21

the -- why did Congress set up a separate board if it's

22

going to be entirely controlled by the SEC?
GENERAL KAGAN:

23

I think it is important,

24

Mr. Chief Justice, and I think that there were a few

25

reasons.

First, Congress wanted to make sure that this
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

board did not compete with the SEC's own resources.

2

Members of Congress thought that the SEC had been

3

resource-strapped and wanted to create something with

4

its own separate funding stream, which it was able to do

5

by declaring this a kind of quasi-governmental agency.

6

Second, it wanted to get the board outside

7

of the normal civil service laws, because it wanted to

8

attract people that it thought it could not attract on

9

normal civil service salaries.

10

And third, I think history and tradition

11

have a great role in -- in the question that you are

12

answering, because what -- the history and tradition of

13

SEC regulation of the financial industry in general

14

is -- is -- in -- in some part through the SROs, the

15

self-regulatory organizations.

16

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Before we get --

17

before you get too far into that, of those first two

18

things, is there any reason Congress couldn't have

19

achieved those same objectives by establishing the PCAOB

20

as a division within the SEC?

21

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I -- I think so.

I

22

think it would have been harder to establish a separate

23

funding stream to take the Accounting Board out of the

24

civil service when the rest of the SEC is subject to

25

normal congressional appropriations and is subject to
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

basic civil service laws regarding salary and so forth.

2

So, this was a way to -- to have both.

3

And it was also, I think --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's -- that's the

5

history and tradition of this board, which isn't very

6

long.

7

is that their investigative powers are independent.

8

Now, you say that there could be a rule, but that just

9

isn't the way it works.

But the history and tradition of boards like this

And if you refer us to history

10

and tradition for other purposes, we ought to look at

11

the operational principles, operational assumptions of

12

this board.

13

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I -- I -- I do think,

14

Justice Kennedy, that -- that the way this board is set

15

up, the statutory scheme and structure, makes it clear

16

that the SEC has comprehensive authority not just over

17

the rulemaking, but over the investigative and

18

inspection activities of the board; that no -- no

19

sanction arising from an investigation can be issued

20

except if the board agrees; that no inspection report

21

can be issued except if the -- excuse me -- except if

22

the SEC agrees.

23

And further, as I said before, that the SEC

24

can reach further back into the process and say, not

25

only do we have this kind of veto authority over any
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sanction that comes out of an investigation or over any

2

report that comes out of an inspection, but we can also

3

change the way those inspections and investigations are

4

conducted in the first place.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does it have

6

consequences for public companies subject to the board

7

if it refuses to turn over documents requested by

8

this -- this board?

9

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, for -- for -- for

10

public companies for -- not for the accounting firms in

11

general, but for their public company clients, any

12

subpoena would have to come, as Justice Ginsburg rightly

13

said --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, I know, but

15

presumably you only get a subpoena when people don't

cooperate.

17

GENERAL KAGAN:

That -- that's correct.

18

And -- and certainly public companies could cooperate,

19

and certainly public companies have cooperated with the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

23

And what happens if

they don't?
GENERAL KAGAN:

I -- I think that the board

25

SEC for a subpoena, and the SEC would choose whether to

If the public

19

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, the board does not

20

regulate the public companies themselves.

21

only regulates the accounting firms.

22

The board

Now, the accounting firms do, as a condition

23

of their registration, have to present any documents

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So there are in fact

collateral consequences that take place without any

involvement by the SEC?

5

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I -- I -- I think

6

again the SEC could change any of the rules that govern

7

inspections, any of the rules that govern

8

investigations.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you had a

10

statute here that said, look, if you don't comply with

11

the board's request for documents, your authorities will

12

be suspended, and if that were the statute, you would

13

say, well, that's okay, because the SEC can always

change that rule.

answer that there are no consequences whatever?

5

GENERAL KAGAN:

There are no consequences

6

with respect to the failure of public companies -- not

7

the accounting firms, but public companies -- to turn

8

over documents absent a subpoena, which the SEC needs to

GENERAL KAGAN:

Let's assume that that's

correct.

4

on Morrison to make the limitations on what the SEC can

I think -And you need to rely

11

GENERAL KAGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, removal

12

is just a tool.

Removal is not the ultimate

13

constitutional question.

14

question is the level of presidential control, and the

15

presidential control here is exactly the same with

16

respect to the board's activities as it is with respect

17

to the SEC staff's activities.

The ultimate constitutional

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

you have got an extra layer there.

20

that you have to have two violations of the for-cause

requirement in two places.

23

the board member, they can only do that for cause.

24

if they decide, well, there isn't cause, I'm not going

that's -- that's a significant limitation that

6

Humphrey's Executor didn't recognize and Morrison didn't

recognize.

8

GENERAL KAGAN:

But that for-cause provision

is surrounded by a panoply of other control mechanisms.

GENERAL KAGAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can they say, you are fired because we have control over

4

what you do and we don't think you should do that?

5

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think that they

6

effectively can.

7

that the easiest, quickest, most legally secure way

8

would be to -- to do it by -- by promulgating a rule

9

that says you can't do this.

10

They would have to do it by -- I think

And then --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The easiest way to

11

do it is to pick up the phone, not by promulgating a

12

rule.

13

GENERAL KAGAN:

I said the most legally

14

secure way to do it would be to do it that way.

15

that the fact that they have that formal mechanism means

16

that they could pick up the phone and accomplish the

17

exact same thing, because --

18
19
20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think

Can the President

pick up the phone and fire the SEC commissioners?
GENERAL KAGAN:

The President can pick up

21

the phone and fire the SEC commissioners for cause,

22

however "cause" has been defined.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He thinks -- he

24

thinks they -- the board should be getting the documents

25

from the other company, and the SEC thinks they can't.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

1

So the SEC tells the board, don't go after that company,

2

and because they do that the President fires the SEC.

3

Does that work under your theory?

4

GENERAL KAGAN:

So now the SEC has given the

5

board one order and the President doesn't like the order

that the SEC has given to the board?

respect to anything else.

11

12

That's just Humphrey's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
it's the same.

14
15

Again, the President has the

same level of control over the SEC as he has with

10

13

GENERAL KAGAN:
Executor.

I'm not worried if

I'm worried if it's enough.
Well, but that's Humphrey's

Humphrey's Executor said it was enough.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

GENERAL KAGAN:

18

Right.

Right.

And then --

And the question is whether

this goes any further.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

It goes further

20

because you've got to rely on the SEC to get to the

21

board.

22

Morrison.

23

So there you've got to rely on Perkins and

GENERAL KAGAN:

You always have to rely on

24

the SEC to do anything, to supervise anybody in its

25

field of operations, whether it's the SEC's own staff or
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether it's the board members, who stand in essentially

2

the same relationship to the SEC commissioners as the

3

own SEC staff does.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, do you dispute the

5

proposition that the more layers of for-cause removal

6

you add, the -- the less control the President has?

7

Suppose there were five layers.

8
9

GENERAL KAGAN:
all depends.

Justice Alito, I think it

I mean, we are not saying that a double

10

for-cause provision is always constitutional, just as we

11

are not saying that a single for-cause provision is

12

always constitutional.

13

The question is, in what context does that

14

for-cause provision operate?

15

context like this one, where it is surrounded by a

16

panoply of alternative and -- and equally effective

17

control mechanisms, it simply should not matter that

18

there's another for-cause provision.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And where it operates in a

Well, what do -- what do

20

you say in response to their formal argument that heads

21

of departments are those people whom the President has

22

at-will control over, like the Secretary of Defense, and

23

Freytag is support for that.

24

people, so the SEC's members must be inferior officers,

25

and the Constitution says nothing about and implicitly

And these aren't those

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

forbids inferior officers from appointing other inferior

2

officers beneath them.

3

All right, that's a formal argument, but I

4

got that out of their briefs, and I want to know what

5

you respond to it.

6

GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, Justice Scalia, who

7

doesn't much like Humphrey's Executor, nevertheless

8

wrote a brilliant opinion in Freytag saying that in fact

9

independent agencies were departments, and -- and -- and

10

so that commissioners of the SEC would be principal

11

officers, their appointees would be inferior officers,

12

if -- if those appointees were subject to the direction

13

and supervision of the principals in exactly the way

14

Justice Scalia said was necessary in the Edmond case.

15

He is --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

So I -- so we have to

17

take the dissent there as opposed to taking the

18

majority?

19
20

GENERAL KAGAN:

No, no, no.

Freytag --

Freytag reserves the question --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

GENERAL KAGAN:

I see.
-- whether the independent

23

agencies were departments for purposes of the

24

Appointments Clause and, indeed, in reserving that

25

question, suggested that they thought that the
50
Alderson Reporting Company

1

independent agencies, so-called, were a very different

2

kind of creature than the small, specialized units such

3

as the Tax Court.

4

So I think that the --

ask one thing:

want us to infer from the statute that there's a power

9

You want us to imply or find -- or you

All right.

And the

What is --

15

what is the authority for us to find that there is an

implication in the statute to remove just for cause?

17

There's -- wouldn't that be unique in our precedents?

18

GENERAL KAGAN:

I think that -- if I

19

understand the question correctly, I think that the --

20

the implication about -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

I mean, if there is a

22

removal power implied, why isn't it removal for all

23

purposes?

24

cause?

25

How -- why can it be limited to just for

What authority do we have to do that?
GENERAL KAGAN:

Well, I think that the
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

understanding about the SEC commissioners is that the

2

SEC commissioners were, essentially, the same as the FTC

3

commissioners, which, under -- which, under Humphrey's,

4

were removable only for cause, and as I believe --

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's because the

statute required it.

7

GENERAL KAGAN:

Yes, but -- you're exactly

8

right, and it's a -- it's a perplexity of this law, but

9

for many, many decades, everybody has assumed that the

10

SEC commissioners are subject to the same for-cause

11

removal provision, and the government has not contested

12

that in this case, nor has Mr. Carvin.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

General Kagan, the

14

government argues here that the head of department is

4

this regard has changed in different administrations,

fact the commission has ultimate authority over each and

8

every appointment.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do they have to

say about the theory that the SEC commissioners can be

removed by the President?

I believe,

Mr. Chief Justice, that nobody has contested that

question.

And you are not

contesting it?

GENERAL KAGAN:

very broad for-cause provision, in the way that Bowsher

21

MR. LAMKEN:

Do you

Well, there's a bunch of other

22

similar entities, such as the SIPC and the like, that

25

And so, yes, I think that's actually not an

uncommon feature, but the most -- but the most critical

Well, the board can

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the reason for

this?

Having read this enlightening opinion of Justice

3

Scalia in Freytag, which is enlightening to me if I've

4

read it correctly,

5

there are two separate questions.

6
7

One question is:

What is a department?

And the second question, which is separate
but mixed up in the cases, but not his, is:

When is it

10

constitutional for Congress to limit the President in

11

his ability to dismiss a -- an officer of the United

12

States or -- inferior or superior -- for cause?

13

And -- and what's -- if you can answer it,

what are the justifications here for imposing that

requirement?

developing -MR. LAMKEN:

The justifications for the

limitations on the removal of the officers of the board?

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. LAMKEN:

That's right.

Right.

And the answer to that

65
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is that these are the standard limitations -- the

2

standard removal provisions that exist throughout the

3

financial area where the SEC has a subordinate entity

4

under its control, and Congress presumed that because

5

the SEC's -- the SEC's control was so pervasive, it

6

didn't need to go back and revisit those standard

7

removal provisions, because -- precisely because -- the

8

SEC has power to rescind the board's enforcement

9

authority, establish rules requiring it to obey

10

commands, disobedience of which would be grounds for

11

removal, to withdraw the salaries.

12

The control is so pervasive that these

13

removal provisions did not have to be reconsidered.

14

from the board's perspective, they're just another means

15

of control, one that actually taints them, as Shurtleff

16

points out, with having committed misconduct.

And I really want to deal with that.

3

This notion that they could pass rules to

5

myth.

6

and everyone knows you can't govern the kind of manifold

14

decisions that prosecutors need to make through some

16

is why it is utterly mythical to pretend that they have

this power.

Justice Scalia, we assume that people

To the contrary, they have emphasized that

So, again -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we took away -- I

mean, one big point was the double for-cause.

So let's

10

say we have said that the SEC could fire board members,

period.

12

Would this statute then be constitutional?

13

Then that would remove the double for-cause.

MR. CARVIN:

Well, I don't think you can

14

sever that provision from the statute, because I

15

don't -- I think you'd be rewriting the statute and

16

re-striking the balance that Congress did.

17

course, it wouldn't solve the Appointments Clause

18

problem because, again, these are principal officers not

19

appointed by the President, and even if they are

20

inferior officers, the SEC is not a department. So --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Moreover, of

So, it's not the double

for -- the double for-cause isn't, in your judgment,

It is a very

serious -- yes, it is on my view absolutely dispositive
73
Alderson Reporting Company

of why the statute is no good.

MR. CARVIN:

Your -- I'm -- I'm to assume

12

that the Appointments Clause problem -- if they are

13

inferior officers, again, I have an Appointments Clause

14

problem, because they are appointed by somebody who is

15

not department head, i.e., the SEC commissioner.

16
17

Do you want me to take that out and assume
that that's okay as well?

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

MR. CARVIN:

Yes.

Okay.

So, if we are looking at

20

it strictly from a separation of powers perspective, it

21

is true that eliminating the for-cause removal provision

22

goes a long way towards fixing the problem, but it

23

doesn't go all the way and for one reason, which is we
