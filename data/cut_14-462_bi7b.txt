            ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

7

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

            MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9

and may it please the Court:

10

            The court below violated the Federal

11

Arbitration Act by refusing to enforce the parties'

12

arbitration agreement on grounds the Ninth Circuit

13

characterized as "nonsensical."

14

            The agreement provides for individual

15

arbitration and expressly precludes class arbitration.

16

And just to underscore that point, it specifies that if

17

State law would force the parties into class

18

arbitration, then the entire arbitration agreement would

19

be unenforceable.

20

            The court below interpreted the reference to

21

State law to mean inoperative State law preempted by the

22

FAA.  But neither respondents nor the court below

23

identified a single case in the history of California or

24

American law adopting that interpretation for any

25

contract.  And it would be

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What about the problem that

2

this is California law and a California court said

3

that's what the contract means under California law?  In

4

other words, I can't find a case that we're supposed to

5

say  or we have the power to say that they're wrong,

6

even if they were to say the words "do not turn on the

7

light" mean turn on all the lights.

8

            MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor.

9

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So  so  and they may

10

have done that in this case.

11

            MR. LANDAU:  Here 

12

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Nonetheless, what do we do

13

about it?

14

            MR. LANDAU:  What you do about it is look to

15

the Federal Arbitration Act.  There is not a general

16

Federal contracts act, but there is a Federal

17

Arbitration Act that Congress passed specifically

18

because a particular kind of contract was not getting

19

enforced by the courts, and Congress was concerned about

20

that.  So what Congress 

21

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The principle of

22

contract interpretation  I  I beg to differ with

23

Justice Scalia, the  I thought that what the court

24

asked itself is what did the parties intend when they

25

used the words "State law"?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

            MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

2

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is that correct?

3

            MR. LANDAU:  That's what the court purported

4

to answer.

5

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's the interesting

6

part.  You used the word "purported."  What California

7

law did it apply 

8

            MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

9

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   that disfavors

10

arbitration?  What contract principle did they use?

11

            MR. LANDAU:  Well, again, a lot of cases,

12

you have courts that are  are bringing in some

13

principle external to the contract, and those are kind

14

of easy cases.  This Court has now made clear that

15

courts can't rely on principles external to the contract

16

that are hostile to arbitration.

17

            But courts also, under the Federal

18

Arbitration Act, have a responsibility to enforce the

19

contract according to its terms with a reference to the

20

Federal substantive law  for more than 50 years, the

21

court has made clear that the Federal Arbitration Act

22

creates Federal substantive law.  What is the content of

23

that Federal substantive law?

24

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What was the point of

25

putting State law in at all?  If Federal law applies,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

then it makes no sense to have any reference to State

2

law.  If State law means State plus Federal law and

3

Federal law trumps State law, the reference to State law

4

is just inexplicable.

5

            MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor.  It's to the

6

contrary, Your Honor, with respect.  The reference to

7

State law was a recognition of the concern  the

8

problem that the parties were confronting, which is

9

State laws were being enacted, as in California in their

10

Discover Bank rule, that would force the parties into

11

class arbitration against their will.

12

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And we had not yet held at

13

the time this contract was made that those laws are

14

invalid.

15

            MR. LANDAU:  Precisely, Your Honor.  And so

16

at that point, the problem they were focusing on was

17

State law.  They could have also said, you know, if this

18

is unenforceable or used the passive voice.  But here,

19

they chose to take the bull by the horns and be honest

20

about what was actually the problem, and they said State

21

law.

22

            But the use of the term "State law" does not

23

indicate a recognition or a desire to  to have

24

inoperative State law that's been preempted by the

25

Federal Arbitration Act.  As the Ninth Circuit said,

Alderson Reporting Company

that 

2

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm still not sure that I

3

understood your answer to Justice Breyer's question.

4

His question was, this Court purported, and did, give an

5

interpretation of the intent the two parties had when

6

they entered into a contract.  And that is a matter of

7

State law.

8

            MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor.

9

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I understand the

10

problem of preemption.  I understand the problem that

11

preemption is  that a judicial decision is

12

retroactive.  This was not the State law.  But the 

13

let's assume that the trial court in the California 

14

pardon me  that the California appellate court said

15

the intent of the parties was to interpret the law to

16

mean A.  And  and "A" meant this superseded or

17

preempted State law.  How can we reverse that

18

determination if it's a matter of State laws

19

interpreting a contract made by two people?  I  I 

20

that was the question and I'm  I'm not quite sure what

21

your answer is.

22

            MR. LANDAU:  I'm sorry.  I'll try to be as

23

clear as I can.

24

            The answer is because  you wouldn't go any

25

further if you didn't have something called the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

Arbitration Act.  And the Federal Arbitration Act says

2

that this particular kind of contract, an arbitration

3

agreement, is not solely a question of State law.  There

4

is Federal substantive law created under the Act.

5

            To be sure as this Court said in Volt  and

6

I'm quoting from Volt:  "The interpretation of private

7

contracts is ordinarily a question of State law which

8

this Court does not sit to review."

9

            And we have no quarrel with that

10

proposition.  But the key word there is "ordinarily,"

11

and this case shows that ordinarily does not mean

12

exclusively.  Because the Court in Volt went on to

13

say  and I think this is critical, and I think you

14

could quote this passage from Volt and be finished with

15

this case.  It says, "In applying general State

16

principles of contract interpretation to the

17

interpretation of an arbitration agreement within the

18

scope of the Act, due regard must be given to the

19

Federal policy favoring arbitration and ambiguities as

20

to the scope of the arbitration clause itself resolved

21

in favor of arbitration."

22

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Does that mean that whenever

23

there is a dispute about the scope of an arbitration

24

clause and a State court says that it includes a certain

25

subject or doesn't  it doesn't include a certain

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

subject, that there is, then, the question of Federal

2

law because insufficient weight has been given to the

3

presumption of arbitrability?

4

            MR. LANDAU:  Yes, Your Honor.  There is a

5

Federal question.  Again, ordinarily you start out with

6

the proposition that contracts are governed by State

7

law.  And we should be very  let me be very clear.  We

8

are not by any means saying that the Federal Arbitration

9

Act federalizes this entire area.  We are kind of saying

10

the opposite, that it generally is a matter of State

11

law, but there is a Federal toll.  So you always have a

12

Federal question to be a check on the State court's

13

application of law for cases like this when it is

14

perfectly clear what is going on.

15

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, this may be an extreme

16

case, but where  how do you define the borderline?

17

            MR. LANDAU:  Again, Your Honor, I think in

18

the average case, the State court can interpret State

19

law as it sees fit, but then this Court's responsibility

20

in reviewing State law  this Court obviously can

21

decide what cases it wants to take to review State law

22

has  this Court's responsibility is to basically do

23

what Volt said it would do, which is did the State

24

court, in applying State law principles, give due regard

25

to the Federal policy favoring arbitration and construed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

out in favor of arbitration?

2

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And I found no case ever

3

that's done that.  And I have exactly the same problem

4

that Justice Alito has.

5

            MR. LANDAU:  Well 

6

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean, once we start with

7

this case, even if this is not too difficult under State

8

law, we've got every arbitration contract in the world

9

where one lawyer or another will suddenly be saying, oh,

10

the interpretation of the contract here by the State

11

court judge is not favorable enough to arbitration or

12

hostile to the act.  And suddenly we have Federalized,

13

if not every area, a huge area of State contract law.

14

            MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor 

15

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, there's another way to

16

do it.  We could just ask the California Supreme Court.

17

Now, what about that?

18

            MR. LANDAU:  Well 

19

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Or  or come up with an

20

answer to what Justice Alito just asked.

21

            MR. LANDAU:  No, your Honor.  Again, you

22

wouldn't ask the California Supreme Court because

23

ultimately this is a Federal law question.

24

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not ask.  No.

25

Ultimately, it's a State law question, what does the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

contract mean.  And the contract, on reading it, seems

2

to mean that it applies to laws that are laws, not laws

3

that have been held unconstitutional.  So what I've

4

looked at, I've looked at civil rights cases, for all

5

kinds of cases.  I can't find any.

6

            MR. LANDAU:  Even if this case came from the

7

California Supreme Court, and the California Supreme

8

Court said we  again, it has never done that, and

9

that's one of the odd things about this case.  But even

10

if the California Supreme Court were to say, we as a

11

matter of California law say that this  you know,

12

State  a reference to State law means preempted or

13

repealed or otherwise inoperative State law  again, I

14

think that's hard to imagine, but let's say they said

15

that, you as the Supreme Court of the United States

16

would still have a responsibility to make sure that that

17

comports with the Federal policy of arbitration.

18

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Maybe that's so.  But if

19

the California Supreme Court had said this, I would

20

look  they would read the Contract as if it said, if

21

there is a law in the State of California, a State law,

22

or if there ever has been, whether that law is

23

constitutional or not constitutional, whether it

24

violates the Supremacy Clause or not, if they ever wrote

25

those words in the State legislature into a law, there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

is no arbitration contract.  Okay?  I guess parties have

2

the right to do that.  And if the California court said

3

as a matter of California law they did it right here, I

4

don't know that we'd have a ground to stand on.

5

            MR. LANDAU:  And that's, Your Honor, where,

6

respectfully, the Federal Arbitration Act, again 

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you  you need a test,

8

Mr. Landau.  You're  you're  I  I sympathize with

9

Justice Breyer's point.  You need some test.

10

            MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor 

11

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where does it stop?  We're

12

going to reinterpret every State interpretation of  of

13

State law that  that ends up invalidating an

14

arbitration agreement?  Certainly not.  So what's the

15

test?

16

            MR. LANDAU:  The test is 

17

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can't you say that at least

18

in this case where  where the State court's

19

interpretation flouts wellaccepted universal contract

20

law principles, the most important of which is you

21

interpret a contract in a manner that makes it valid

22

rather than invalid.  And they went out of their way to

23

interpret this in a manner that causes the whole

24

agreement to be thrown out.

25

            MR. LANDAU:  Correct, Your Honor.  That is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

why this 

2

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So give us a test.  Say

3

that, you know.

4

            MR. LANDAU:  The test 

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You don't have to go any

6

further than that, where it  where it flouts standard

7

contract interpretation principles.

8

            MR. LANDAU:  Well, certainly, Your Honor,

9

that is clearly one way to look at 

10

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you really think that

11

the parties here  this is something that I don't know

12

whether to quarrel with or not.

13

            The California court said, we don't know

14

what the parties even thought about preemption.  And it

15

was three years into litigation that preemption was

16

settled by this Court.  Do you really think they would

17

have said that  one of the parties would have said,

18

your adversary, oh, yes, now I'll go into arbitration

19

after three years of litigation?

20

            MR. LANDAU:  Absolutely, Your Honor, because

21

the only reason that they were not arbitrating from the

22

getgo was because 

23

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was because California

24

law said 

25

            MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   you don't.

2

            MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's what they wanted.

4

If California law said no, they wouldn't.

5

            MR. LANDAU:  Right.  Right.  And so once it

6

is clear that the thing that would have forced them into

7

class arbitration is gone, either because the California

8

Supreme Court repealed it or because this Court held it

9

to be preempted, then it  again, it's nonsensical to

10

say 

11

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But when they entered 

12

when they entered the agreement, both parties

13

contemplated that State law meant California law.

14

That's why you did not object to the lawsuit being

15

brought in court.  So if the parties' intent at the time

16

they entered the agreement and at the time the lawsuit

17

in court was started was clear, the parties intended

18

that the arbitration agreement would be out because the

19

no class action was unenforceable in California.  That's

20

what they intended at the time they made the contract;

21

isn't that so?

22

            MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor.  What they

23

intended was that this would turn by reference to State

24

law.  At that time, State law was as Your Honor

25

describes.  You are absolutely correct.  But they didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

say, if State law as it exists today requires

2

arbitration.  In other words, there's nothing in the

3

contract that freezes this in a particular point in

4

time.  It takes a snapshot 

5

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we're trying to find

6

out what the parties meant, why wouldn't we look to see

7

what they meant at the time the contract was formed?

8

            MR. LANDAU:  Well, because, again, it's 

9

what the contract that they chose used an important

10

verb.  We've been talking a lot about the noun in the

11

sentence, the clause "the law of the State."  But then

12

the verb says if the law of the State would find, not if

13

the law of your State today finds.

14

            And imagine, Your Honor, if California had

15

repealed its CLRA, which has the antiwaiver provision

16

that they are relying on.  Well, I don't think anybody

17

would say, well, because the CLRA was in effect at the

18

time this thing was  was enacted, that if a CLRA is

19

later repealed, we still have disclaimed arbitration.

20

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So, Mr. Landau, let's assume

21

you're right, that this is a really bad mistake when it

22

comes to arbitration.  So just to take you back to

23

Justice Alito's point and Justice Scalia's point, you

24

know, usually we don't fix bad mistakes 

25

            MR. LANDAU:  Correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   when State courts

2

interpret State law.  I mean, there are a lot of

3

mistakes when it comes to interpretation of contracts,

4

including arbitration agreements.

5

            So, again, what's the standard?  There's

6

nothing on the face of this opinion that indicates

7

hostility to arbitration.  To the extent that you can

8

find reasoning in this opinion, which you have to search

9

to find, but to the extent that you can find reasoning,

10

it's about interpreting form contracts, interpreting 

11

whenever you see an ambiguity in a form contract, you

12

interpret it against the drafter.  And that's a

13

principle of contract interpretation that, as far as I

14

can see, has been used hundreds of times in California.

15

It appears to be a very common principle of contract

16

interpretation in California whenever California courts

17

look at a contract of adhesion.

18

            So why isn't that just what they did, and is

19

what they did?

20

            MR. LANDAU:  Fair enough.  But even by its

21

terms, the predicate for that is some ambiguity.  You

22

can't just say, well, guess what, contract of adhesion,

23

immediately we go to construing against the drafter.

24

You have to have an ambiguity.  There's no antecedent

25

ambiguity.  And the court really didn't identify

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

anything other than to totally question begging

2

assertion that the general  specific governs the

3

general.

4

            Again, Your Honor, I want to be very clear

5

here, our rule is very narrow.  And this Court does not

6

have to go any further than it went in Volt to say,

7

generally, contract interpretation, even if it's

8

erroneous, is a matter of State law.  But  and we're

9

not saying that every mistaken contract interpretation

10

gives rise to a Federal question.

11

            What we are saying, though, is just that the

12

Federal court's role is to make sure  to look at what

13

the State court did and say, can we see that this court

14

gave effect to the healthy Federal policy regarding

15

arbitration and construed doubts in favor of

16

arbitration?  Here, you see the opposite.  And, you

17

know, with respect, Your Honor, you can't see on the

18

face of it that they say it's hostile, but how 

19

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we draw the line

20

between 

21

            MR. LANDAU:  Excuse me, Your Honor.

22

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do we draw the line

23

between wrong and the standards you're arguing?

24

            MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, again, I think  I

25

was quoting to you the language from Volt.  That has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

worked for the last 30 years that it's been on the

2

books.  I think  this case, again, is not a great case

3

for saying how wrong does wrong have to be.  I mean,

4

clearly, here, it's nonsensical.  Again, I think there

5

may be cases that will have  and I think you have a

6

standard.  If I were to come  I could use other words

7

like unreasonable or manifestly wrong.

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm back to my point.  I

9

looked in civil rights cases.

10

            MR. LANDAU:  Right.

11

            JUSTICE BREYER:  The south passed statute

12

after statute like the sitin statutes and so forth to

13

try to prevent the Equal Protection Clause from being

14

implemented.  So I looked at a few of those that my law

15

clerk got.  In none could I find the court saying this

16

matter of State law where it isn't itself

17

unconstitutional, you know, what  what is a trespass

18

and so forth.  There  it violates the Federal law,

19

what they'd say is we interpret the State law.

20

            MR. LANDAU:  Well 

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:  They've gone that far,

22

because we think the State would interpret the State law

23

this way.  But I can't find an analogy to what you're

24

saying.

25

            MR. LANDAU:  Well, again, Your Honor 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

            JUSTICE BREYER:  We'd have to say an

2

interpretation of a contract where that interpretation

3

is  is what?

4

            MR. LANDAU:  Please go back to Volt.

5

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What  I'm looking for the

6

standard.

7

            MR. LANDAU:  Is not 

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You read me the words.  It

9

didn't say what to do.

10

            MR. LANDAU:  Okay.

11

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It said they have to

12

conform with Federal 

13

            MR. LANDAU:  Well, no.  It said  it said

14

they must read it with a  with the 

15

            JUSTICE BREYER:  That looks like we're the

16

supervisor of all State contract interpretation judges.

17

            MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor.  Again, what 

18

again, what Volt says, it's  ordinarily, it's a

19

question of State law.  Your  your role as under the

20

Federal  there is substantive Federal law under the

21

Federal Arbitration Act.  That has been clear and

22

established for more than 50 years.  The State  the

23

Federal Arbitration Act applies in State Court.  That

24

has been clear for more than 30 years.  If you say 

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  My other suggestion 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

we're not going to make too much progress on finding the

2

standard, but California does accept requests from us,

3

or other Federal courts, to explain what California law

4

is.  I've looked at that statute.  And if this is so

5

outrageous as a matter of contract interpretation of

6

State law, why don't we just ask them?

7

            MR. LANDAU:  Because, again, Your Honor 

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  They have not considered

9

this case.

10

            MR. LANDAU:  They  they denied certiorari

11

over the  one of the justices.  And  but, again,

12

what Your Honor's role is is to interpret this as a

13

matter of Federal law.  So the  again, it would go

14

away if  if they were to change the rule as a matter

15

of State law.  But ultimately, the Federal issue is

16

always present here.  The  again, there's always a

17

Federal issue just to make sure that the State court

18

hasn't gone too far.

19

            Again, I understand exactly what the Court

20

is grappling with.  Where do you draw the line on where

21

it goes too far.  Again, our point is this case is so

22

far on one side of the line.  And  for instance 

23

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why  give us all the

24

reasons why this case is on the wrong side of the line.

25

            Justice Breyer has  has mentioned the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

the rule of contra proferentem, that you interpret a 

2

a contract against  against the person who drafted it.

3

            Now, that's on the other side.  What are 

4

what are the rules of contract law that  that so

5

clearly outweigh that?

6

            MR. LANDAU:  I think, Your Honor, you

7

started out by, one, that you want a contract to be

8

valid.  They went out of their way to look to a way to

9

make this unenforceable.  And if you just take a step

10

back and look.  It is 

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Make what unenforceable?

12

            MR. LANDAU:  The arbitration agreement.

13

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, the arbitration

14

agreement was enforceable in lots of situations.

15

            MR. LANDAU:  No, Your Honor 

16

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  There was no agreement

17

to arbitrate class actions.

18

            MR. LANDAU:  Right.  But their 

19

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But there was an

20

agreement to arbitrate other disputes.

21

            MR. LANDAU:  That's not their 

22

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And single disputes.

23

            MR. LANDAU:  Their position is that the

24

arbitration provision is entirely unenforceable in this

25

case.  This arbitration is entirely unenforceable with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

respect to California.

2

            Again, what is going on here?  It's clear

3

the parties say we want to arbitrate our disputes,

4

unless State law forces us into arbitration.  Once State

5

law can no longer force you into arbitration, they don't

6

have any plausible narrative for why the parties would

7

have agreed to blow up and jettison their arbitration

8

rights if nobody is actually forcing them into

9

arbitration.

10

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Go back to Justice Scalia,

11

please.  What I understood this to be is one reason this

12

interpretation from your perspective is an unreasonable

13

really weird one is because the statute basically says

14

go to arbitration unless you are in a State where the

15

law would require class arbitration.  And if that's the

16

State you're in, dump the whole arbitration 

17

            MR. LANDAU:  Right.

18

            JUSTICE BREYER:   business.  Okay.

19

            Now, one reason that's a bad interpretation

20

is that probably what they meant is valid State law.

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course.

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  That's one.

23

            MR. LANDAU:  Right.

24

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Now, is there any other?

25

            MR. LANDAU:  There's another one, Your Honor

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

that in Section 10 here, there's a choice of law

2

provision specifically addressing the arbitration

3

clause.  And the general choice of law provision is in

4

Section 9 of the agreement, but  excuse me, in Section

5

10  but it says, "notwithstanding the foregoing."  In

6

other words, the fact that State law and FCC or other

7

law applies.  With respect to the arbitration provision,

8

the FAA shall govern.

9

            So our position is, it is nonsensical to say

10

that when the contract goes out of its way to say the

11

FAA shall govern the arbitration provision, that you

12

would take a reference to the law of your State in the

13

arbitration provision and say the law of your State

14

completely unaffected by the FAA.

15

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Landau, I completely

16

take your point as to what the parties must have wanted,

17

and it does make this State court opinion unsatisfying,

18

would be a kind word for it, but  but, you know, in

19

fairness to the State court, part of the problem was the

20

way this contract was worded.  Everybody else finds ways

21

to word contract provisions like this so that there

22

isn't a problem.  If the contract had said, you know, if

23

class action waivers are invalid in your State, then

24

Section 9 is unenforceable, there would have not have

25

been this problem.  This is  it's a very unusual

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

contract provision.  Most companies use very clear ones.

2

This one did not.

3

            And so the  the State court had to sort of

4

puzzle over what it meant and, as you say, probably got

5

the answer wrong.  Strike the "probably."  Got the

6

answer wrong.  But, you know, wrongness is just not what

7

we do here.

8

            MR. LANDAU:  Your Honor, but, again,

9

wrongness is not what you do here, but this is an

10

arbitration contract.  And, again, I think this is why

11

you have to 

12

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did you draft this

13

provision, Mr. Landau?

14

            MR. LANDAU:  I did not, Your Honor.

15

            (Laughter.)

16

            MR. LANDAU:  But, again, I  I  I am not

17

defensive about the way this was drafted.

18

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How 

19

            MR. LANDAU:  They said State 

20

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How was the provision

21

changed?  Now, this provision is no longer in DIRECTV

22

contracts; is that right?

23

            MR. LANDAU:  That's correct, Your Honor.

24

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And what  what  it

25

was taken out and what was put in instead?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

            MR. LANDAU:  The new provision, Your Honor,

2

which I have here, it says  it just  it takes out

3

the word "State law" and just says "if this is

4

unenforceable."

5

            And, again, the  but the reason it said

6

State law was not to suggest that inoperative State law

7

should do it.  It was recognizing the fact that the evil

8

against which it  the clause was being put in was

9

State laws that would force you into class arbitration

10

against your will.

11

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do we have  do we have

12

someplace that has the change that was made in the

13

language of the contract?

14

            MR. LANDAU:  I do, Your Honor.  I have the

15

new  here it is, Your Honor.  The current version of

16

the DIRECTV contract says, "A court may sever any

17

provision of Section 9 that it finds to be unenforceable

18

except for the provision on class representative and

19

private attorney general arbitration."  That's in

20

Respondent's brief on Page 36.

21

            Again, I'm not saying there aren't other

22

ways to write it, but the fact that there are other ways

23

to write it doesn't mean that it's ambiguous.  And

24

again, I'm sure this Court construes many statutes that

25

could have been written in other ways, but that doesn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

make them ambiguous.

2

            Let me just please underscore one more

3

point.  If the contract  and the California Court of

4

Appeals said, if in Section 9 the law of your State is

5

governed by the FAA, if that had been in Section 9, then

6

they would have had no problem with this enforcing the

7

arbitration provision.  But it does say that.  It just

8

says that in Section 10.  Section 10, the choice of law

9

provision, specifically says that the FAA shall govern

10

Section 9, the arbitration provision.  The law of your

11

State language in Section 9 is governed by the FAA.  So,

12

in fact, it is right there on the contract.

13

            And, again, at the end of the day, we know

14

that Congress had a  Congress was concerned because of

15

this kind of gimmick where courts were coming up with

16

strained interpretations to avoid enforcing arbitration

17

provisions.  This is FAA 101.  We are not asking this

18

Court to make any new law, but just to reinforce what

19

you said in Volt, which is ordinarily, it is a matter of

20

State law.

21

            And, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, you said

22

that you couldn't find any case.  Well, Volt is a case

23

where the Court went on to examine.  The Court didn't

24

say we defer to California State law and it is,

25

therefore, unassailable to use the words that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

Respondents would.

2

            To the contrary, Volt said we are going to

3

consider the  the interpretation proffered by the

4

State court and decide whether we think it is consistent

5

with the Federal policy favoring arbitration in the FAA.

6

So there is a Federal component.  It isn't 

7

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But the  Volt says the law

8

of the place interprets the law of the place exactly in

9

the way  or allows that interpretation exactly in the

10

way that this State court interpreted it.

11

            The law of the place was just the law of the

12

State unmodified by any possibly preempting Federal law.

13

            MR. LANDAU:  Right.  But in Volt, of

14

course  the issue in Volt was that the court there did

15

not refuse to enforce arbitration.  The Volt court said,

16

you know, we don't have a problem with this, because

17

this is all about the efficient process in terms of

18

arbitration.  And the Volt court went out of its way to

19

say we find that this favors the Federal policy

20

fostering arbitration.

21

            And the court reiterated that specific

22

interpretation of Volt and insisted on it in

23

Mastrobuono, Casarotto and Preston.  In other words,

24

Volt took pains to say that the interpretation that we

25

upheld there was a pro arbitration provision that gave

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

effect to the Federal policy favoring arbitration.

2

            I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

3

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

4

            Mr. Goldstein.

5

          ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

6

              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

8

Justice, and may it please the Court:

9

            This case is a reprise of Oxford Health.

10

The argument of the party that wanted arbitration in

11

Oxford Health, the arbitrator had just gotten it

12

terribly wrong under this Court's decision in

13

StoltNielsen.  And this Court may well have had

14

sympathy for that, but the Court realized that it was

15

going to actually have to write an opinion about the

16

case, an opinion that the lower courts were going to

17

have to apply in later cases.  And the difficulty is

18

that if you interject Federal law here, you are going to

19

have just a wealth of DIRECTV challenges, because in

20

every instance in which the State court announces here's

21

how we understand this language, which is State law

22

language in our contract, it will be open to the party

23

proposing arbitration to say no, actually, if there is

24

an ambiguity in the  in the law  excuse me  in the

25

contract, then you are obliged to apply a presumption in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

favor of arbitration, and this is always a Federal

2

question.

3

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, but that's 

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So if you said that 

5

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If  that may be a

6

problem with the FAA.  But the FAA was adopted because

7

State courts were hostile to arbitration and Congress

8

didn't like that.  Now, how were they hostile to

9

arbitration?  They were hostile to arbitration by

10

adopting special rules of contract interpretation that

11

disfavored arbitration.  And in those instances, what

12

the FAA says is that that's what they wanted to stop,

13

special rules of contract interpretation, ordinarily a

14

matter of State law, but not when it's hostile to the

15

FAA.

16

            And what could be more hostile to the FAA

17

than to interpret a phrase that says nothing about the

18

FAA to dispense with our holdings about  as they came

19

about  our holdings about what the FAA has to say.

20

And to do that even though there's a provision in the

21

contract that says this is governed by the FAA.

22

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So, sir 

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  In other words, I

24

understand  I'm sympathetic to the notion that this is

25

a matter of State contract interpretation, but that is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

precisely what the FAA was getting after, State judges

2

interpreting contracts under special rules hostile to

3

arbitration.

4

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  So, Mr. Chief Justice, if I

5

could deal with your real concern about where this

6

statute comes from, the idea that this is kind of the

7

core discrimination against arbitration that the statute

8

is after kind of structurally and then what exactly

9

happened in this case.

10

            The root of the FAA  and it's reflected in

11

the  in the statutory text in Section 2  is that

12

State courts were adopting doctrines that were hostile

13

to arbitration.  Discover Bank's one of them this Court

14

concluded.  What the FAA is not concerned with  and

15

Congress could well pass a law that would be  is the

16

threshold question of whether there's an arbitration

17

agreement in the first place; that is, we have been

18

unable to locate in this Court or any other court a time

19

when the courts overturned the determination under State

20

law whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate vel non.

21

That's an antecedent question.

22

            It may well be that Congress could conclude

23

that there is a problem like that and adopt a statute

24

like it.  But to do that here is to really open up an

25

enormous can of worms.  What you have is the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm not sure that I

2

understand what you're arguing.

3

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Sure.

4

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're arguing that the 

5

the FAA does not cover State gimmicks that disfavor

6

arbitration so as long as what they say is there is no

7

arbitration agreement in the first place.

8

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  No, Justice Scalia, don't 

9

don't misunderstand me.  If the Court were to 

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's what you said.

11

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I apologize, then.

12

            If the Court were to conclude that this is

13

just an effort to discriminate against arbitration, then

14

I think the Court has doctrines and the lower courts

15

have doctrines.  We are not saying that you have to turn

16

entirely a blind eye to the idea and let a State court

17

get away with anything.

18

            My point is different.  And that is, that

19

this is not a doctrine that is intended to discriminate

20

against arbitration.  It is not an indicia of a

21

pattern 

22

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if we were to

23

look to determine whether it is 

24

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah.

25

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   surely, that's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

Federal question.

2

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.  If you were to  we

3

agree that there is a backstop here, and it's an

4

important backstop.  And that is, if you conclude that a

5

court is just, you know, making it up and discriminating

6

against arbitration, we think that's an important role

7

for the court to play.  But the difference here is that

8

the argument is that the State court really got this

9

wrong and had an obligation to kind of presume that the

10

parties wanted to engage in arbitration.

11

            That is a very, very, very different

12

proposition of law because it asks the Federal courts to

13

interject and the State courts to interject 

14

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's exactly what Volt

15

says, what Mr. Landau quoted, is "Due regard must be

16

given to the Federal"  in interpreting a contract.

17

We're talking about interpreting the intent of the

18

parties  "Due regard must be given to the Federal

19

policy favoring arbitration and ambiguities"   we

20

could ask whether or not this clause is  this statute

21

is ambiguous  "and so the scope of the arbitration

22

agreement must be resolved in favor of arbitration."

23

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  There are two points

24

about that.

25

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Now, if this was a State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

law contract looking at State law principles, but there

2

is a Federal rule that must be followed in  in making

3

that interpretation, and that is a matter for us to

4

review.

5

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  There are two things

6

about that.  The first is, Justice Kennedy, the language

7

that kind of trailed off in your sentence is that the

8

Court has been very clear that ambiguities in the scope

9

of an arbitration agreement have to be construed in

10

favor of arbitration, and here's the reason.  And that

11

is, if we know these parties have agreed to arbitrate 

12

this is in the first options.  It's in lots of cases 

13

if we know you and I have agreed to arbitrate so that

14

there's an arbitration agreement, we're going to assume

15

that all of the cases fall into the bucket of

16

arbitrability, and that's a fair commonsense

17

presumption.

18

            But what the Court said in Justice Thomas's

19

opinion for the Court in Granite Rock is that the

20

question of whether there's an enforceable arbitration

21

agreement at all is not  is a State law question, not

22

a Federal law question, and here's the reason.  There

23

are two interpretive principles under the Federal

24

Arbitration Act.  Number one is, we want to only require

25

people to arbitrate when they have  we are convinced

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

under their State law contract they did intend to

2

arbitrate.  We can't presume that you and I intend to

3

arbitrate because that's the question we're asking.

4

            And the most important thing for you to

5

understand about the nature of this Section 9 in the

6

contract is that it does determine whether there is

7

going to be any arbitration at all in California.  That

8

is to say, is there any agreement between DIRECTV and

9

its California consumers to arbitrate?

10

            And I can point to  it's very important

11

that you understand that.

12

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess I just don't

13

understand, then, Mr. Goldstein  and maybe it's the

14

same question that Justice Scalia asked  I don't see

15

why it's better somehow to discriminate against

16

arbitration by declaring arbitration agreements

17

unenforceable writ large than it is by narrowing the

18

scope of arbitration agreements unfairly.

19

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  There are two just 

20

there are two rules at stake.  When it comes to the

21

question of whether you and I have an arbitration

22

agreement at all, what the court has said is two things.

23

One is, this is going to be a matter of State law.  But,

24

of course, if all you're doing is  this is a game.

25

You're just trying to evade enforcing the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

Arbitration Act.  That's a  you know, that's a role

2

for the Federal courts.

3

            What Mr. Landau is relying on and what the

4

language that's quoted from Volt that comes from Moses

5

H. Cone is talking about is something quite different.

6

And that is, construe every ambiguity in favor of

7

arbitration.  That's what I'm resisting, not 

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What he'll say, I think, is

9

 we certainly pressed him on it enough  is that

10

the  read the sentence, the relevant sentence.  "If

11

the law of your State would find the agreement to

12

dispense with class action procedure unenforceable, then

13

the entire Section 9 is unenforceable."  All right.

14

That's what it says.

15

            Now, would the law of California find the

16

agreement "dispense with class action" procedure

17

unenforceable?  The answer to that question is clearly

18

no.  Because they did have a law like that, but it was

19

invalid.  So in order to read this in your favor, you'd

20

have to say these words:  If, however, the law of your

21

State would find this agreement, you have to read it as

22

saying, if, however the invalid law of your State would

23

find this agreement to dispense with class action

24

unenforceable, then.

25

            Now, nobody  it's very hard to say that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

the parties meant if the invalid law of your State would

2

find it and, therefore, contract interpretation is a

3

question of law, this question of law was decided by

4

California to read the word "law" as "invalid law,"

5

there is no case in California or anywhere else, to our

6

knowledge, that has interpreted contracts in such way

7

out of the arbitration context, and therefore, this rule

8

of law interpreting this word this way is discriminating

9

against arbitration.  That's something like what the

10

argument he's making.  Your answer to that is?

11

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  First, is that there is no

12

administrable line that he can identify between

13

something that's wrong and really, really wrong.  But in

14

any event, it's not  it's not correct that the

15

contract is improperly interpreted.

16

            Here are the reasons:  The first is that,

17

Justice Breyer, if you and I have a contract that says

18

if California law would prevent us from having a class

19

action waiver, we will not arbitrate at all.  That is

20

not preempted.  That's the second holding of Volt.

21

Remember, all AT&T versus Concepcion is, is a rule that

22

says, if California forces us to engage in class action

23

arbitration.  But you and I can agree to anything at

24

all.

25

            This contract, when it says, "If the law of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

your State would find the class action waiver invalid"

2

is a perfectly fine thing for us to agree to.  That's

3

State law and even accounts for preemption because the

4

FAA does not preempt California law in that

5

circumstance.

6

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But does California have a

7

law, a valid law that would find the agreement to

8

dispense with class action unenforceable?  Does it or

9

doesn't it?

10

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It does.  It does.

11

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It does.  In other words,

12

California now has a law that makes it okay to dispense

13

with class action procedures.

14

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  In several respects.  The

15

first is there are several cases  there are an array

16

of cases that aren't subject to the Federal Arbitration

17

Act.  And the second is if you and I agree to follow

18

that law, it is not preempted.

19

            Let me also point to some other indicia

20

that's going to make it very hard for 

21

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But you have to agree with

22

Justice Breyer  or do you not  that California

23

interpreted this contract as saying if there is an

24

invalid State law that prohibits arbitration, then

25

that's binding on us.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.

2

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That's what you're saying.

3

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  We don't, Your Honor.

4

            So remember, my point is this:  If you and I

5

have a contract to follow that State law, which is this

6

is a contract, then it's not invalid because Concepcion

7

and preemption only apply when the State forces you to

8

do something.  But in all events 

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, sure.  The parties can

10

do anything they want.  But the question is, did the

11

parties do what they want  did the parties do that

12

here?

13

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Right.  And, Your Honor, my

14

problem is that that's going to be the question in every

15

case.  And if we say we're going to reverse this

16

decision, then every time there's going to be a Federal

17

question about whether this is really what the parties

18

intended, that every time that the contract is  is

19

ambiguous under State law.

20

            But I did have a couple of other things 

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's one horrible, and

22

the horrible on the other side is if we  if we agree

23

with you, the States can do whatever they want to  to

24

invalidate arbitration agreements so long as they're

25

doing it under the guise of contract interpretation.  Is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

that not also a horrible?

2

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  It is  is a possible

3

horrible, Justice Scalia.  So let me just give you the

4

choice between the two of them.  There is no evidence

5

that the latter is actually happening, and you do have

6

the backstop.  And that is, we fully agree that if you

7

conclude that a State court is just making it up and

8

discriminating against arbitration, the FAA has a role

9

to play.

10

            What I'm saying to you is that they do, in

11

truth, want a different legal rule, and that is, you've

12

got to construe these in favor of arbitration.  That's

13

the principle that he's trying to derive from Volt, Your

14

Honor.  That's a whole other kettle of fish than the

15

backstop that you and I are talking about.

16

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, if we could see a

17

State court opinion that doesn't say anything that is

18

explicitly against arbitration, but it interprets a

19

contract in such a strange way that the only possible

20

explanation for the interpretation is hostility to

21

arbitration, can that be invalidated?

22

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I think so, Your Honor.

23

And 

24

            JUSTICE ALITO:  So that's the question.

25

Does this case fall to that category?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  All right.  If that's what

2

the question is, because that is not the Volt principle.

3

That is the idea that this is just wildly out of bounds.

4

It's the incredibly factbound question about whether

5

this one decision is wildly out of bounds.  So let me

6

talk about the other reasons it's not remotely wildly

7

out of bounds.  Because if you write an opinion about

8

anything other than legal rule you just articulated,

9

Justice Alito, we are going to be in an incredible way.

10

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, you say that's not

11

the Volt principle.  Why isn't it the Volt principle?

12

Ambiguities.  I mean, this is even more than an

13

ambiguity.  Even ambiguities have to be interpreted 

14

resolved in favor of arbitration.  And this is more than

15

an ambiguity.

16

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay, Justice Kennedy.

17

Because in my  I may be mistaken, but I think that you

18

and Justice Alito are describing two different legal

19

rules.  Justice Alito is saying, as I understand it 

20

and I don't purport to speak for the Justice,

21

obviously  is that if this is a crazy decision, it's

22

invalid under the FAA.  The ambiguities construed in

23

favor of arbitration principle is an ordinary

24

interpretive principle.  And the reason, Justice

25

Kennedy, just to bracket this, why the Volt principle,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

the Moses H. Cone principle doesn't apply here, and that

2

is that it's ambiguities in the scope of an arbitration

3

agreement.  Here the question is whether the parties had

4

an arbitration agreement whatsoever.

5

            So we  I think we've now agreed on the

6

legal rule perhaps.  And so let me tell you, if I could,

7

why I don't think you can write an opinion that says

8

this is nuts.

9

            JUSTICE ALITO:  And add to that, what did

10

the Ninth Circuit say about this?  The Ninth Circuit

11

said it was absurd.  Was that the word?

12

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah, it was 

13

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Right.

14

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:   nonsensical.

15

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Nonsensical.

16

            If we agreed with the Ninth Circuit that it

17

was nonsensical, we 

18

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I mean, I just don't want to

19

 I don't want to play around with words, Your Honor,

20

about nonsensical or not.  I think you and I are

21

basically on the same page about the FAA principle.

22

            Here's what I have in terms of why this is

23

not remotely outside the bounds, why, if you write an

24

opinion reversing here, you are going to invite an

25

enormous amount of secondguessing of State law contract

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

interpretation.  The first is that Section 10 of the

2

contract expressly contrasts State and Federal law; that

3

is, it says the law of your State, and then

4

distinguishes Federal law from that.

5

            The second is, as Justice Ginsburg says, why

6

is it the parties even referred to State law at all if

7

what they are talking about is just "it would be

8

invalid."

9

            The third is both before this contract and

10

after this contract, DIRECTV wrote this contract very

11

differently in the way that it now says this contract

12

means, and it says if it would be found invalid, and as

13

was mentioned in the first half hour, every other

14

Fortune 500 company wrote it that way as well.  So there

15

are a whole series of very good contrasts for us.

16

            I also have what I think is the pushback to

17

the intuition that DIRECTV really must have always

18

intended for the contract to pick up Federal preemption

19

law.  And here's the reason why that's not right:

20

DIRECTV claims and has applied the power to unilaterally

21

change this contract, and that is a huge deal in the 

22

in the context of a national form contract.

23

            Here's what happened here:  DIRECTV put this

24

into the contract in 2006 before AT&T v. Concepcion was

25

a glimmer in anyone's eye at all.  And it referred to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

State law, and everybody agrees at that time that

2

California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act was going to

3

control and was going to prevent any arbitration in

4

California whatsoever.  DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in

5

Concepcion saying we will not arbitrate with anyone in

6

California before the court's decision in Concepcion.

7

            And the way that DIRECTV intended to account

8

for changes in the law is that they would change the

9

contract unilaterally when the law changed, and I can

10

prove it.  In the wake of Concepcion, DIRECTV rewrote

11

the contract.  It did it before the California Court of

12

Appeals' decision in this case.

13

            DIRECTV had another mechanism fully

14

available to it that would account for the idea that

15

now, under the Federal Arbitration Act, the State can't

16

forbid class action waivers.  It didn't need this

17

contract to do anything other than to pick up existing

18

California law.

19

            And I will add a couple of other points just

20

about whether, as a matter of Federal law, you would

21

want to say that right now we have to go to arbitration.

22

Remember, DIRECTV's position is in the teeth of the

23

efficiency of the Federal Arbitration Act.  Its view is

24

that the parties intended that three years into the

25

litigation, what they would want is to blow up the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

litigation and send everybody to thousands of individual

2

arbitrations.  That is an extremely implausible

3

interpretation of what the parties would want if their

4

goal was to have an efficient dispute resolution

5

mechanism.

6

            And so what I'm  the point that I'm trying

7

to make, Your Honors, is while I am sympathetic to the

8

concern, and it may be a concern directed at California

9

in particular, that we need to be attentive to whether

10

or not those courts are discriminating against

11

arbitration.  My point to you is that you may believe

12

this is wrong, like you were concerned in Oxford Health

13

that the arbitrator had got it wrong, but you have to

14

adopt a legal rule here.  And there are too many points

15

in favor of the California Court of Appeals' decision to

16

say that this is wildly out of bounds and have an

17

administrable legal rule that the lower courts can

18

actually apply.  You can say it's way out of bounds; you

19

could say it's nonsensical.  But then the lower courts

20

are going to look at what happened here, and they are

21

not going to view it as something that is just wildly

22

impossible.

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I guess I don't

24

understand why it's a question of way out of bounds or

25

slightly out of bounds.  It's a question of whether it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

demonstrates hostility to arbitration.  And I think the

2

way you show that is you say, well, look, here they

3

found a number of provisions illegal, and they struck

4

the whole thing.  Here, every other case that's not

5

about arbitration, when they find a couple of provisions

6

illegal, they just sever those; they keep  you know,

7

try to keep in effect the rest of the agreement.

8

            That's a different rule for arbitration

9

contracts than other contracts.  It's not a question of

10

way out of bounds or way in bounds.  It may be a hard

11

question in some cases; it may be easy in others.  But

12

it's a very simple question of  of what the rule is.

13

The rule is does it demonstrate hostility to arbitration

14

contracts?

15

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.  Mr. Chief Justice,

16

let me just distinguish this case from the one that you

17

granted in the Long Conference, which is the factual

18

scenario that you just described.  In that context, what

19

you have is an arbitration agreement.  You know that the

20

parties have agreed to arbitrate and what you then do is

21

assume that they intend the arbitration to be effective.

22

This is importantly, doctrinally a very different case.

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's  I

24

understand the point and  but, as I understand the

25

arbitration law, if you have an arbitration agreement,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

says you're going to arbitrate workplace disputes, but

2

not safety disputes 

3

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yes.

4

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   and if there's an

5

issue, is this a safety dispute or not, that's covered

6

by the arbitration agreement.  The arbitrator decides

7

that.

8

            If you have a contract that says you agree

9

to arbitrate with all of our subsidiaries except the one

10

that does this, that's not for the arbitrator because

11

you have to decide if that other subsidiary has agreed

12

or not.

13

            Now, this one talks about methods of

14

arbitration.  It doesn't seem to me to be covered by

15

either of those two paradigms.

16

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Excellent.  So you've just

17

described Prima Paint and the assignment between the

18

court and the arbitrator.  Here is why it is in the

19

paradigm of not favoring  not presuming arbitration,

20

and that is, the effect of this contract, Your Honor.

21

The effect of Section 9 is not to determine  this was

22

Justice Sotomayor's question about whether there'd be

23

some arbitration in California, but just not class

24

arbitration.  The effect of this provision is to mean

25

that there will be no arbitration between DIRECTV and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

any of its customers in California at all.  There is no

2

agreement to arbitrate any dispute.

3

            And let me just give you the proofs of that.

4

They filed an 

5

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but just clear

6

up, there is an agreement to arbitrate some disputes

7

between DIRECTV and its customers.

8

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Your Honor 

9

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It's the arbitration

10

agreement.

11

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Your Honor, so  if I could

12

just distinguish.  There is an agreement on the subject

13

of arbitration, that is to say, Section 9 is in the

14

contract.  What Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act

15

asks is, is there an agreement with  to resolve any

16

disputes by arbitration?  And what Section 9 tells you

17

in the States where it is effective, where the  what

18

we call the blowup clause takes effect, is that in all

19

of those States, DIRECTV will not arbitrate with

20

individuals, it will not arbitrate with respect to class

21

arbitration.

22

            If I could just give you the reasons we know

23

that's true.  DIRECTV filed an amicus brief in

24

Concepcion saying we do not arbitrate with anybody in

25

California.  It then  and you can see this in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

Stevens declaration in opposition to the motion to

2

compel arbitration said we have gotten 215 small claims

3

requests related to these early termination fees, which

4

is  and in court, which is the subject matter of our

5

complaint.  And we have arbitrated with one party.

6

            So what was going on  and so there  in

7

California, DIRECTV was arbitrating with no one

8

whatsoever because of this contractual provision.  And

9

that brings it not within the Volt principle, Your

10

Honor.  We interpret  when we have an arbitration

11

agreement, we're going to put things into the bucket,

12

your argument  your  your point, Your Honor, about

13

scope when it comes to safety disputes.  But rather,

14

within Granite Rock, which said quite expressly, what we

15

are  when we are talking about the antecedent

16

question, we're trying to figure out if you and I have

17

agreed to arbitrate any subjects whatsoever.  When we're

18

in that circumstance, we can't presume that we are

19

arbitrating, because the first principle of the Federal

20

Arbitration Act is to not force people to arbitrate when

21

they haven't intended, and to require people to

22

arbitrate when they have.

23

            So, Justice Kennedy, the distinction I was

24

drawing with Justice Alito is if we had an arbitration

25

agreement and we were trying to figure out if, say,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

class cases were in and individual cases were out, it

2

would make a little bit more sense to say we're going to

3

presume and resolve ambiguities in favor of putting

4

class cases in.

5

            But this is not that situation.  It is the

6

question whether we are going to arbitrate with anyone.

7

Now, that is not to say that Federal 

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It may be, but that's quite

9

different from the question of whether there was an

10

arbitration agreement.  Certainly, whether there was an

11

agreement in the first place is quite different from

12

what the meaning of the agreement is.  And the  the

13

courts decide the  the first thing, and it's  and

14

not the arbitrator.  But this is not a  there is no

15

doubt here that there was an agreement.

16

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  I 

17

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  There is no doubt that

18

there was an agreement.  The only issue was a matter of

19

interpretation of that agreement, whether a provision of

20

the agreement blew it up.

21

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Okay.

22

            Justice Scalia, what I am saying is you 

23

I  you and I agree, but the consequence of the place

24

we disagree is important; that is, you and I agree that

25

this is in the contract.  We have a contract on the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

subject of arbitration.  When this Court has said that

2

we will construe arbitration agreements and their scope

3

to include all the subject matter, that is, we will

4

construe them in favor of arbitration, it has been doing

5

so when we not only have an agreement on the subject of

6

arbitration, but we have an agreement to arbitrate some

7

disputes.

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It may have.  They may

9

have.  And I just don't want  I want to give you one

10

other issue.

11

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Yeah.

12

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Because it's in my mind,

13

and I'd like you to respond to it, if you wish.  Because

14

I think there's some pretty good arguments that this

15

particular interpretation, consciously or unconsciously,

16

is flying in the face of an opinion of this Court, which

17

I disagreed with.  That was an opinion that  that said

18

that this particular provision of California law is

19

invalid.  I dissented.

20

            All right.  So we have, on the one hand, the

21

risks that we'll get into, too many State law cases, if

22

we take their side.  On the other hand, there is the

23

risk that they'll run around our decisions.  Now, when

24

you get to that second thing, even though I dissented, I

25

think it's an extremely important thing in a country

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

which has only nine judges here and thousands of judges

2

in other places who must follow our decisions  and

3

think of the desegregation matters, et cetera  that we

4

be pretty firm on saying you can't run around our

5

decisions, even if they're decisions that I disagree

6

with, okay?

7

            Now, I raise that because I think it is a

8

factor, and so I would like you to  to say whatever

9

you want.

10

            (Laughter.)

11

            MR. GOLDSTEIN:  Justice Breyer, there's one

12

threshold point that needs to be made, and that is five

13

members of the Court in Concepcion, as I understand

14

their opinions, would not have applied Concepcion in

15

this circumstance.  They would not extend it here

16

whatsoever, because the four members of the Court who 

17

you and the other members of the Court who agreed with

18

it would not extend it to the circumstance in which the

19

parties have agreed by contract.

20

            And Justice Thomas explained in his opinion

21

in that case that the opinion there  that the  the

22

principle opinion depended on obstacle preemption, and

23

there is no argument here that this case implicates

24

obstacle preemption because it's a question of contract

25

law.  So at the threshold, I don't think Concepcion

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

would apply here at all.

2

            But your question is bigger.  And that is,

3

look, I'm concerned that if we, as the Supreme Court 

4

U.S. Supreme Court articulate a question of Federal law,

5

particularly on a statute that's as important as the

6

Federal Arbitration Act, particularly on a statute that

7

is  is rooted in a concern about hostility of the

8

State courts, we have to show people that we're serious.

9

A couple of things about that.

10

            First is, we know the California courts are

11

serious in the wake of  excuse me.  We have filed a

12

supplemental brief.  The California Supreme Court has

13

decided a case called Sanchez.  And Sanchez dealt with

14

the contract that is written like every other Fortune

15

500 contract is.  And it talks about if the  the

16

provision barring class action waivers would be deemed

17

invalid.  And the California Supreme Court said that's

18

controlled by Concepcion.  That is an enforceable

19

arbitration agreement right there.  And so now we are

20

dancing on the head of the pin about one contract that's

21

entirely defunct, and the question of whether the

22

reference to State law, when contrasted in another

23

provision of the contract with Federal law, is so far

24

out of bounds.

25

            I think that what you have to do is compare

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

two prospects, Justice Breyer.  One is the concern.  And

2

we recognize the concern that if you write in an opinion

3

that says, nah, we're not going to take too hard a look,

4

that the State courts will run wild.  All I can tell you

5

is that there really isn't evidence of that happening at

6

all.  And the Court has doctrines like discrimination

7

against arbitration that can handle it.

8

            The second is a reality.  We know for a fact

9

that if you announce an opinion that says, this

10

interpretation of State law  because we know what the

11

California law is here.  The California Court of Appeals

12

has told us.  This interpretation of State law is just

13

too bad and invalidated my arbitration agreement, that's

14

now a question of Federal law, and we are going to

15

relitigate what State law means.  That is a boundless

16

rule that is going to be invoked in every single

17

arbitration case.  And so you just have to choose

18

between those two prospects.

19

            One is you know what will happen.  You will

20

be going against the very first principle of Federal

21

arbitration law, which is that we look to State law in

22

determining whether an arbitration agreement is formed,

23

or you have the hypothetical prospect.  And what I can

24

say to Your Honor is we have a legislature that is there

25

in the event that the hypothetical prospect comes to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

pass.  We have doctrines to deal with this.  I am just

2

terribly worried about how it is that you write an

3

opinion that says this is not just wrong, it's really

4

really wrong, and explain why in the face of the other

5

things in this contract, the contrast with other

6

contracts that I have given you are out there.  You do

7

retain the possibility, of course, of not deciding the

8

case at all in the wake of Sanchez, why it is that we

9

need to have an opinion about this, given that this is a

10

contract that doesn't exist anymore, and the California

11

Court of Appeals has resolved it is a question that 

12

that is, you know, very difficult to answer.

13

            But if you are going to write an opinion in

14

the case, please do not do it in a way that just invites

15

litigation upon litigation upon litigation because you,

16

as in Oxford Health, are concerned that this Court got

17

it wrong, just like you were concerned that the

18

arbitrator got it wrong.  It is an unfortunate cost of

19

the Federal system that Congress decided this is the job

20

of the Federal courts.  Not everything is a Federal

21

case.

22

            If there are no further questions.

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

            Mr. Landau, you have three minutes

        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

2

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

            MR. LANDAU:  Thank you, Your Honor.  I'd

4

like to make three very quick points.  First, the fact

5

that opposing counsel, my friend, started with Oxford

6

Health is very telling because Oxford Health was a very

7

different case about the scope of this Court's review of

8

an arbitrator's decision.  Everyone there agreed that

9

the parties had delegated the question of the

10

interpretation of the clause to the arbitrator.  And

11

that's a very different question.  We don't have that

12

here.  We are  in this case, this Court is reviewing

13

what a court did.  You're not reviewing it under the

14

arguable standard.  It's a very different standard.

15

            Second, my friend said that, well, no

16

question that special rules for arbitration would be

17

preempted is discriminatory.  And again, those tend to

18

be easy cases.  You're not probably seeing as many of

19

those cases anymore.  But now this case in a sense shows

20

that there's a new frontier, when a court will just

21

basically reach the same goal by saying black means

22

white.  Guess what?  I haven't done any different rule.

23

I'm just applying State court principles of

24

interpretation.  But at some point, you can't just have

25

a rule 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Excuse me.  Why 

2

everybody is assuming that this is just a crazy

3

interpretation, but if you start with the proposition

4

that it's the intent of the parties, and everybody's

5

framing this as invalid State law, or valid State law,

6

but your own company decided before Concepcion that it

7

was okay, they would litigate everything, they would

8

take the words as they stood.

9

            MR. LANDAU:  Because prior to Concepcion,

10

State law was valid.  The question is 

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  No, it wasn't.  If it

12

was preempted, it was preempted back then.

13

            MR. LANDAU:  Well, Your Honor, but it's hard

14



15

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And  and it's

16

preempted forever.

17

            MR. LANDAU:  And it would have been futile

18

to make that argument.  In fact, we would have been

19

subject to punitive damages.  I mean, we were just

20

taking it at its 

21

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Probably could have done

22

what happened here and bring it up to the Supreme Court.

23

            MR. LANDAU:  Well, again, you know, hats off

24

to AT&T for doing that, but there are futility doctrines

25

that recognize that not everybody has to do that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  And how far does this

2

go?  When do we make this judgment?

3

            MR. LANDAU:  Again, Your Honor, you could

4

decide this case on the ground, as the Chamber of

5

Commerce urged in its amicus brief, that this is so far

6

beyond the pale as an interpretation, that it can only

7

be explained as discrimination.  Again, discrimination

8

is  you know, it is an existing category for knocking

9

these out.  It's not the exclusive category.  And I

10

think discrimination becomes a hard principle to apply

11

when you have individual contracts.  Somebody can always

12

say well, you know, my  you know, discrimination

13

anticipates you have two things that are similarly

14

situated.  So how can you say you're discriminating?

15

Again, I 

16

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why  why is it that

17

it's so farfetched 

18

            MR. LANDAU:  It's so farfetched 

19

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   to place the

20

legitimacy of this action at the time the complaint is

21

filed as opposed to three years later or the day before

22

a trial or the day after a trial before judgment is

23

entered?

24

            MR. LANDAU:  Because the parties use 

25

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You could come in and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

make a motion at any of those times.  Why does the

2

interpretation of the contract 

3

            MR. LANDAU:  They use 

4

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   have to be at the

5

time that you make your 

6

            MR. LANDAU:  Because they use the verb tense

7

"would find," Your Honor.  They didn't say State law

8

right now.  They didn't freeze it in place.  There's

9

nothing  and they have no way of saying when it would

10

be frozen in place.  Just a line  in a sense, this is

11

the ultimate gotcha kind of case.  And the question

12

before this Court is, is this Court going to basically

13

give a stamp of approval to a gotcha?

14

            The last point I want to make is that the

15

other  my friend says that there's a question here

16

about whether there was an arbitration agreement in the

17

first place.  There is absolutely no question that

18

there's an arbitration agreement.  The California Court

19

of Appeal acknowledged that there was an arbitration

20

agreement and construed it to be selfdefeating,

21

construed there to be a blowup provision that destroyed

22

what the parties were trying to accomplish.

23

            Thank you, Your Honors.

24

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.
