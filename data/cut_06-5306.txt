CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Mancino.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL MANCINO, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. MANCINO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Petitioner is before this Court because he

11

followed an order of the district court.

12

notice of appeal within the time authorized by the

13

district court.

14

the court of appeals was it raised that the district

15

court apparently had no authority to grant a 17-day

16

extension, although it specified a specific date rather

17

than the 14 days in connection with the case.

18

He filed his

It was only when the matter came before

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, it was authorized by

19

the district court in the sense the district court put

20

it on a piece of paper.

21

the district court had no authority to extend that.

22

MR. MANCINO:

It wasn't authorized because

The district court put it on

23

there.

When you look at the actual entry itself, it's a

24

handwritten entry.

25

handwritten entry whether that entry was even entered on

There's no way of telling from the

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the docket on the same date because all you have is the

2

handwritten entry, February 10, file your appeal by

3

February 27, which is unusual in a civil case because

4

normally in a civil case you get a judgment; you don't

5

get a directive from the Court that you have 30 days to

6

file a notice of appeal or anything in connection with

7

this.

8

directive from a court.

So I don't think it's unreasonable to rely upon a

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you knew that 14

10

days was the maximum because the motion asking for it

11

cited and quoted from the rule.

12

MR. MANCINO:

Well, that -- we did cite from

13

the rule.

14

well, first of all, we were glad to get the order to

15

allow time to appeal; but looking at the order, or just

16

looking at the date, something had to be done.

17

course, we filed on one day before the end date -

18

That is correct.

When the order came out -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And Of

What if, what if the

19

District Court gave you an extra month?

20

argument still be the same, that that -- because the

21

court set it, that trumps the limitation in the rule?

22

MR. MANCINO:

Would your

Well, then you get into

23

certain time limits, whether it's reasonable under the

24

circumstances, would a reasonable attorney or litigant

25

rely upon a, you know, expansive period of time that the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court gave to it.

2

unreasonable.

3

you have a specific end date, do your notice of appeal

4

by this date.

5

But here certainly this order is not

It's certainly within the confines.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wouldn't a reasonable

6

lawyer have said see, I referred to the rule, when I

7

made this motion for extension of time.

8

14 days; this judge obviously made a slip.

9

miscalculated.

10

And

The rule said
He

Wouldn't a lawyer faced with what the rule

11

clearly says and an inconsistency scribbled on an order,

12

say the judge probably made a mistake?

13

I want to protect my client, do what the rule says?

14

MR. MANCINO:

So I better, if

Well, looking back, that is

15

probably correct.

But looking at the order, and the way

16

it came out, and the fact that you know, the -- the rule

17

allowed for a reopening of the appeal, just looking at

18

the end date of the order, make sure the notice of

19

appeal is filed by that date, it would seem to me that

20

the party who is adversely affected by it may object on

21

that basis, saying Judge, you have no authority to do

22

this, what are you doing in connection with -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

just a notice of appeal.

25

it the same day?

Why isn't -- this is

Why would you -- why not file

In terms of looking at it from some
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

equitable sense, I don't understand why you wait toward

2

the end of the period assuming you hadn't focused on the

3

difference between the 14 days and the days allowed.

4
5

What -- why, why would you delay filing the
notice of appeal?

6

MR. MANCINO:

Well, the only reason for

7

delaying it is obviously workload.

And you don't want

8

to get all briefs due within a short period of time,

9

once you get your notice of appeal filed in a particular

10

case, because you have time limits for getting the

11

record, your briefing, and you know, there's a number of

12

appeals going out -- not in this Court, but you know

13

there were a number of appeals going on.

14

And my normal practice is you know, file

15

your notice of appeal near the end of the applicable

16

appeals time.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does it make -- does

18

it a difference that we're dealing with the safety valve

19

provision?

20

file; and then this rule allows you to -- it's a safety

21

valve, if you didn't get the notice or whatever, you've

22

got a certain procedure that can give you the extra 14

23

days.

24

safety valve on top of a safety valve.

25

In other words, you've got the 30 days to

And now it seems to me that you're asking for a

And I wonder if there's some point where you
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cut off the -- allowing an out for missing the deadline.

2

MR. MANCINO:

Well, I suppose at some point,

3

someone may say well, if the court gave you 180 days to

4

do the act, someone may say well, that appears to be

5

unreasonable in connection with that.

6

thing is just to put the order down, say application,

7

reopen the appeal time, granted.

I think the safer

8

And then it would cause someone to go you

9

know, go back, look at the rule, see how much time is

10

allotted under the rule in connection with the case.

11

But I don't think it's unreasonable; in these

12

circumstances we're only talking about three days to do

13

an act.

14

The act was done in two days.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but as soon as

15

you start talking about an exception from the provision

16

in the rules, then you're going to get a lot of

17

applications and there are going to be a lot of

18

different reasons for why it wasn't filed on the last

19

day.

20

indeterminate ruling.

21

Once that -- it seems to me, you open it up for an

MR. MANCINO:

Well, this is an equitable

22

rule in itself.

Because it allows something where an

23

appeal time has expired, can you come in and show the

24

circumstances, one, you were not notified, which

25

obviously the court did.

The other side's prejudiced 7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well it is an equitable

rule conditioned upon compliance with time limits.

3

MR. MANCINO:

Well, that's -- that's once

4

it's granted.

5

the seven day after you received or became aware actual

6

notice -

7

It's not, the time limit is 180 days or

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but

8

Justice Kennedy's point I think is critical.

In other

9

words, the drafters of the rule obviously wanted to

10

provide a safety valve.

11

you can't have it open-ended.

12

on the -- if you want to call it equitable exception to

13

the 30-day rule.

14

restrike the balance the drafters of the rule struck if

15

you allow further equitable departures from their, their

16

rule.

17

But they also appreciated that
So they did impose limits

And it seems to me that you sort of

MR. MANCINO:

Well, I think in past cases

18

the Court has always recognized there are deadlines but

19

there are exceptions to deadlines.

20

compelling exemption is where a court says do the act at

21

this particular time.

22

judicial officer, it's not coming from someone

23

miscalculating on the calendar, calculating the time

24

when it's 30 days run, when is 14 days run, when it's 10

25

days run in connection with the case.

And the most

And you know, it's coming from a

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Because in civil

Official - Subject to Final Review

litigation you are not given any specific time to do an

2

act.

3

are told about an appeal, when an appeal has to be filed

4

in connection with a case.

5

when you get your final order -- you know you have 30

6

days to do it.

7
8

Criminal cases are a little bit different.

You

You do not have in civil,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Mancino, your position

here is that this rule is not jurisdictional.

9

Now, what -- what are the consequences of

10

that?

I take it that that would mean that the court of

11

appeals has no obligation to inquire on its own whether

12

the matter has been filed too late?

13

MR. MANCINO:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I believe Right?

If the parties

15

don't make anything of it, the court of appeals can -

16

can take a late, a late filing?

17

MR. MANCINO:

Well, I think when the court

18

of appeals does that, I think in all fairness, they

19

should advise the parties in advance that they we're

20

considering this on our own, that the appeal was out of

21

time, and would you like to -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, but I'm asking

23

whether a court of appeals has to even worry about that?

24

If the parties don't make anything of it, the court of

25

appeals can just assume it's okay and go ahead, right?
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. MANCINO:

Correct.

Because I think

2

they've waived any -- the other side obviously has

3

waived or forfeited any right to object to the -- you

4

know, to the -

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

or else it's, it will be okay?

7

MR. MANCINO:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

I'm sorry?
And you need an objection

or else it will be all right?

10
11

And you need an objection

MR. MANCINO:

Yes.

The objection in this

case came -- you know, in the -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That means that a rule -

13

that -- 14 days is really a rule left to the discretion

14

of the district judge.

15

giving a little more, this would be no control, unless

16

the opposing side objects; is that right?

17

MR. MANCINO:

If the district judge feels like

Well, I -- I believe it does

18

call for a timely objection by somebody to say

19

something, rather than to just sit back and let it

20

expire, knowing that someone did something that they

21

should not do in connection with -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose you have problems

23

at home.

I don't know, you have an illness at home.

24

And you ask counsel for the other side, you know, I know

25

it's a 14-day limit, but would you give me 20 days?
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Right?

And opposing counsel being as friendly as they

2

are nowadays -

3

(Some laughter.)

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- the other, the other

5

side would say sure, take 20 days.

6

prepare a paper for signature by the judge and he signs

7

off on it, gives you 20 days.

8

MR. MANCINO:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay?

So you

That's okay then, right?

Well I Because the other side's

10

agreed.

He won't object on the court of appeals.

11

suddenly, suddenly, you've got 20 days even though the

12

rule says 14.

13

MR. MANCINO:

And

Well, there you have somewhat

14

advance knowledge that you're doing something possibly

15

contrary to a rule.

16

you do it, are you forfeiting your right to object and

17

claim a deficiency in the process.

But then you have the issue of once

18

Here you're only -- what you're doing -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

may, that may be true of this stage; but

21

Justice Scalia's question points up the problem of what

22

do we do if we write this case?

23

this rule?

24

not binding, then going forward, it seems to me to allow

25

the hypothetical that he puts to you.

Well, I mean, that -- that

How do we formulate

And if we say that it's not jurisdictional,

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What I think is the

That's why we're wondering

how to write the opinion.

(Laughter.)

7

MR. MANCINO:

And where did the litigant

reasonably rely upon an order of the court, which

9

apparently the court had authority to issue, regardless

10

of the court making a mistake or doing something

11

intentionally -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the person who did the

reliance was you, I guess?

14

MR. MANCINO:

Yes, that's correct.

Would your -- would

and set a date certain for you to file the notice of

than 14, and you filed it on the ninth day, in other

words within the 14 days given under the rule.

I

Would you be out of luck because of what the

district court set out in its order as what's binding,

2

as opposed to what the resume says?

3

on the fact the rule says you get 14 days?

MR. MANCINO:

Why wouldn't the

3

And in looking back later on, in connection with

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know sometimes,

4

sometimes district courts take jurisdiction over a case

5

that they -- that they shouldn't have jurisdiction over.

6

MR. MANCINO:

Well -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And sometimes in reliance

8

on that, you go through a whole trial and it comes up to

9

the court of appeals and we say huh, there was no

10

jurisdiction here; too bad.

11

MR. MANCINO:

Well -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even though the court said

13

it and you went through a whole trial in reliance on the

14

district judge.

15

District judges make mistakes.

MR. MANCINO:

Well, that's a whole -- I

16

believe that's a whole different scenario than presented

17

here.

18

That goes to the subject matter JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

to me.

20

and so forth.

It's even worse, it seems

I mean, you've wasted weeks, you know, in trial

21

MR. MANCINO:

Right.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if it's jurisdictional,

23

we have to say, you know, too bad.

Yes, you were misled

24

by the judge.

In reliance on the district judge, you

2

And that's the end of the matter.

MR. MANCINO:

Well, the rule I always

3

remember from law school is that parties cannot

4

voluntarily confer jurisdiction on a court that does not

5

have it.

6

have subject matter jurisdiction, is free to dismiss the

7

case whether it's at trial level, the appeal level, or

8

whatever.

9

And the court, at any point, if they do not

This is not that situation.

Obviously, the

10

court by the rule could look into this matter.

11

court by the rule could grant relief in connection with

12

this matter.

13

It's a question whether the three days -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I know I could find this

14

out by looking at a calendar.

15

of the week February 24th was, or 26th?

16

MR. MANCINO:

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

Do you remember what day

I believe We don't have a weekend

problem, do we?

19

MR. MANCINO:

20

don't believe it was a weekend, no.

21

The

I believe it was not -- I

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I looked at this.

There's

22

a time start.

23

when this document was entered on the ultimate appeal.

24
25

And I think it might be the time stamp

But -- but something you said at the outset
prompts this question, that -- Did you think that -- the
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

time runs from $14 days after the date when the district

2

court's order is entered.

3
4
5

MR. MANCINO:

When it's entered.

That's

correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And was there a submission

6

or an implication in your remarks that you thought that

7

the order was not entered until three days later?

8

MR. MANCINO:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10
11
12
13

No.
Is there an entry -- is

there a time entry on the dock -- on court's order?
MR. MANCINO:

No.

It's a handwritten one

that doesn't say anything JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I know that it's a

14

handwritten one.

But that that -- that shows how long

15

he has to appeal.

is there a date when the order was

16

put on the docket?

17

Does that show on this sheet?

MR. MANCINO:

No.

There's nothing from the

18

clerk indicating -- on the docket there is, but nothing

19

on the document that was sent, because the document only

20

was sent -- it was just handwritten over the -- on top

21

of the motion, so there was no way of telling when it

22

was entered.

23

this case, when the court dismissed the original

24

petition, the court had a date on it.

25

days later that it was actually entered by the clerk,

Because you look back at the history of

17
Alderson Reporting Company

It was only 18

and of course that triggered the time for asking for

2

reconsideration.

3

So -- but -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about the weekends?

5

mean, maybe the judge -- I -- it looks from my

6

calendar -- I wondered what day of the week it was.

7

don't remember.

8

the week was it?

9

That I cannot answer.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It looks like it was the

11

middle of the week.

12

weekends.

13

didn't know how to count the weekend rule.

So maybe there were one or two

So maybe what the judge's mistake was, he

2

What's -- what's -- what's the three-day
mail rule?

3

MR. MANCINO:

Well, normally if you are

4

allowed to do an act by mail, you have three days, you

5

can serve a party and then you have three days to file

6

with the court as part of the Civil Rules.

7

think that's what the judge -- because this was going

8

out by mail -- he probably didn't get -- I wish I would

9

have saved the envelope, but I don't have the envelope,

I sort of

10

but it probably didn't get to my office for three days

11

anyway.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Speaking of the three-day

13

mail rule, maybe the judge's intent when he signed this

14

was that it actually was entered, took effect as of

15

three days later.

16

MR. MANCINO:

Well, there's really no -

17

looking at the document, there's no way of telling that.

18

That is correct.

19

believe that was probably the reasoning of the court

20

that, you know, it took three days to get mail because

21

you didn't get -- it wasn't sent out last time,

22

obviously you did not get the mail the last time, so he

23

added the three days, and then you have the 14 days to,

24

you know, perfect or file your notice of appeal to get

25

it to the court in this case.

There's no way of telling that, and I

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One of the things I

think the drafters of the rule wanted to assure is that

14

there would be a point at which the prevailing party in

15

the district court could know with certainty there

16

wasn't going to be further proceedings in the case, and

17

that's the purpose of the 180-day period and all that.

18

It's not open-ended.

19

Under your rule where the actual time for

20

filing could be at some indefinite point, they'd never

21

really quite have that assurance, would they?

22

MR. MANCINO:

Well, unless the court

23

specifically granted to the litigant a specific period

24

of time, and you know, normally litigants and lawyers do

25

not ignore what the court says.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. MARSHALL

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

MR. MARSHALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The petitioner's failure to meet the 14-day

23

statutory deadline for filing his notice of appeal is

24

fatal to his case for three reasons.

25

First, the 14-day period is mandatory and
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdictional, and Federal district courts do not have

2

the power to enlarge this time period.

3

Second, the 14-day rule was not forfeited by

4

the state of Ohio and may be raised by the court sua

5

sponte in any event.

6

Third, even if there could be some sort of

7

limited equitable exception to the 14-day time

8

requirement, the petitioner here falls far short of

9

demonstrating why he is entitled to such extraordinary

10

relief.

11

Let me explain why.

The petitioner's claim

12

that notice of appeal time requirements are not

13

jurisdictional contradicts 150 years of practice,

14

countless lower court decisions, settled congressional

15

understanding as to the meaning of its governing -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What type of jurisdiction

17

are you speaking of?

18

jurisdiction in the sense of subject matter

19

jurisdiction, like a specific case arising under Federal

20

law.

21

It's certainly not Federal

What kind of jurisdiction do you have in mind?
MR. MARSHALL:

Your Honor, I think it is its

22

own form of subject matter jurisdiction in the same way

23

that final judgments on appeals are subject matter

24

jurisdiction.

25

appeals are classically jurisdictional in that sense, in

And the reason why is that notice of

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that they transfer the locus of the case from one court

2

to another.

3

changing of the jurisdiction, and the notice of appeal

4

is that triggering mechanism.

5

classically jurisdictional and different from the other

6

kinds of time limits that this Court addressed in

7

Kontrick, in versus Eberhart because those took place

8

within a particular court system, the district court

9

system, where here there was a transfer of jurisdiction

10

triggered by the notice of appeal from one court to the

11

other.

12

In the appellate system, there's actually a

JUSTICE ALITO:

And in that sense, it is

Isn't that just a word game?

13

It's jurisdictional because it transfers jurisdiction

14

from one court to the other.

15

does that make it jurisdictional?

16

MR. MARSHALL:

Why should that be -- why

Well, I think, Your Honor,

17

the same way that final judgments are.

18

judgments are a jurisdictional prerequisite to transfer

19

from one case to another.

20

I mean, final

The second reason, Your Honor, by the way,

21

is congressional, is the congressional reenactment of

22

the notice of appeal time deadlines, which

23

also indicates that Congress treats these -

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can you think of anything

that's enacted by Congress as jurisdictional?
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. MARSHALL:

No, Your Honor, but when

2

there is a background, as there is in this case, of 150

3

years of practice where Congress has enacted against

4

that background, it is presumed to be jurisdictional.

5

And I'd also point out that with respect to this Court's

6

jurisdiction, the Court has treated petitions for

7

certiorari as jurisdictional in civil cases because

8

there is a statutory underpinning, but has not treated

9

them as jurisdictional in criminal cases in part because

10

there is not a statutory underpinning.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't the latter suggest

12

that a rule that concerns the transfer of a case from

13

one court to another is not necessarily jurisdictional?

14

MR. MARSHALL:

Your Honor, I think the

15

latter recognizes the fact that it doesn't necessarily

16

have to be.

17

That is correct.
However, that Congress and this Court can

18

treat such a thing because it is in a -- because it is

19

a -- because it does transfer the case from one to

20

another.

21

certiorari case, with respect to criminal, it might be

22

an indication there that there might be some relation.

23

But I would also suggest that with respect to certiorari

24

practice, you've already -- you're already in the

25

appellate mode and you're not dividing the jurisdiction

I think that the criminal -- that in the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

between trial courts and appellate courts.

2

But the quick answer is yes, Your Honor, I

3

don't think it has to be jurisdictional, but certainly

4

it can be jurisdictional.

5

and Congress has treated this particular division as

6

jurisdictional.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And for 150 years, this Court

Well, it seems to me that's

8

what we're back to, that it's long been treated as

9

jurisdictional.

But you just said that it's not

10

sufficient that it's been enacted by Congress and it's

11

not sufficient that it transfers the case from one court

12

to another.

13

So we're back just to history, right?

14

MR. MARSHALL:

Well, Your Honor, it's more

15

than just history, because I think Congress reenacting

16

2107 against this background for 150 years, that this

17

issue has been treated as jurisdictional, puts Congress

18

behind this as well.

19

not a matter of -

chapter that deals with procedures, as opposed to

jurisdiction.

13

MR. MARSHALL:

But this

15

something is jurisdictional or not, one looks at the

context of the particular location.

and reenacted against the background of this Court

consistently saying it's jurisdictional and treating

this rule as jurisdictional, and that's since cases as

far along as Edmondson.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You know there have been

24

been vastly overused, it's a word of many meanings.

25

you are telling me that the meaning of these statutes is

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

subject matter jurisdiction, just like it's diversity,

2

is there a federal question?

MR. MARSHALL:

Yes, Your Honor, in the same

4

way that amount in controversies are also subject

5

matter.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But amount in controversy

7

is in 1332.

8

It says diversity of citizenship plus amount in

9

controversy, all in 1332.

10
11

Congress putting it right there together.

Here the limit appears in a

statute, a rule of procedure, not jurisdiction.
MR. MARSHALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

But that

12

statute has been enacted against, as I keep

13

reemphasizing, 150 years of practice, including the

14

Edmondson case in 1869, where the Court on its own

15

motion raised the matter as being jurisdictional and

16

because the time period had not been complied with

17

dismissed the appeal.

18

The question essentially isn't whether we're

19

going to call it jurisdictional or not.

The question is

20

the effect of the particular rule.

courts call its indications of jurisdiction or a

22

prerequisite to jurisdiction.

21

according to Mr. Mancino the only reason he took 16 days

was the judge authorized that.

authorized that, the rule wouldn't have been discarded

22

wait until the 17th day.

23

MR. MARSHALL:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

But this is just -

In other words, he
He didn't have to

That's correct, Your Honor.
Why does that matter?

I

mean, also Osterneck I happened to guess involved a case
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that took place on Tuesday.

2

Thursday.

3

you could say doesn't quite fit it, but so what?

4

purpose of this Osterneck I take it is to have a very

5

narrow exception where a judge tells you basically what

6

to do, and you follow what the judge said, and then, lo

7

and behold, they hit you with this jurisdictional thing

8

and you didn't get it right.

9
10
11

This case took place on

I mean, I grant you the language literally
The

Now, that seems to be its purpose, and the
language is very close, so why not follow it?
MR. MARSHALL:

Your Honor, the purpose of

12

the unique circumstances doctrine is not to give a

13

license to litigants to rely on district court errors.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That would be the

15

very narrow circumstances doctrine, not the unique

16

circumstances doctrine.

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

I notice the court applied

19

it twice, so it couldn't quite be the unique

20

circumstances.

21

MR. MARSHALL:

That's right, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question.

23

Supposing there was a dispute as to whether the order

24

had been entered on February 10 or February 12.

25

handwriting was illegible.

Say his

Would that be a dispute that
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would remain open throughout the appellate process?

2

MR. MARSHALL:

Your Honor, the question is

3

when the clerk of court would have entered for the entry

4

of judgment.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If he'd entered this order

6

on February 12 or 13 -- I forget which day it was -- the

7

appeal would have been timely?

8

MR. MARSHALL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And I'm just -- and the

10

order was defective because it didn't make findings

11

required by the rule.

12

it was ambiguous as to the date it was actually entered.

13

Would the party then be entitled to rely on the date,

14

February 27th, set in the order, or would he have a duty

15

to investigate and find out exactly when the judge

16

signed the order?

17

And I'm just wondering, supposing

MR. MARSHALL:

I think the key question,

18

Your Honor, I think is when the -- when the order is

19

entered into the docket, which is done by the clerk of

20

course.

21

I think that is the triggering time.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

My question is what if

22

that's somewhat ambiguous?

A busy court, he handed it

23

to the clerk and the clerk didn't enter it into the

24

docket.

25

that.

You're not sure, there's a fact dispute about

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. MARSHALL:

Your Honor, that's a

2

different case.

3

beginning case, if there was some ambiguity there.

4

The beginning time period is a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand.

I'm just

5

wondering what your view is, how should courts resolve

6

that kind of dispute?

7

remains open throughout the appellate process/

8

a factual dispute as to when the judge signed order.

9
10

Should that be a dispute that

MR. MARSHALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

There's

Again, the

factual dispute is when the -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If he had written here,

12

instead of "2-10," he had written down "2-12," then the

13

prosecutor 3 days later realized he had written down the

14

wrong date, would that have made the appeal untimely?

15

MR. MARSHALL:

Your Honor, I think the

16

question at that point is what is the time period

17

entered into the formal docket, and what is the actual

18

judgment.

19
20
21

JUSTICE STEVENS:
saying.

And that's ambiguous, I'm

That's ambiguous.
MR. MARSHALL:

If for some reason the court

22

records are jumbled for some reason or another and

23

nobody can determine when that entry of order is, that's

24

a different case.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In that case, you then

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rely on the February 27 date in the order?

2

be permissible to rely on appeal to be filed by 2-27?

3

In such a case it would be okay.

4

MR. MARSHALL:

Then it must

Again, Your Honor, the

5

critical thing with the rule period is the time period

6

from the entry of judgment.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I know, and I say it's

8

hard to figure out when the order was actually written

9

down in the docket.

10

MR. MARSHALL:

I think that the question

11

that would be required then was for whoever was filing

12

the notice of appeal to determine when the entry of the

13

docket is.

14

on the litigant to err on the side of caution, Your

15

Honor.

16
17

If that's ambiguous, I think it's obligatory

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And not rely on the 2-27

date.

18

MR. MARSHALL:

I would certainly suggest

19

that a litigant argue on -- err on the side of caution

20

if at all.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Justice Breyer quoted

22

from the Osterneck case.

There was another statement of

23

the rule which goes like this:

24

exception covering cases in which the trial judge has

25

misled a party who could have and probably would have

There is a sharply honed

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

taken timely action as a trial judge conveyed correct

2

rather than incorrect information.

3

into that description, doesn't it?

4

PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL:

This case fits right

No, Your Honor.

The

5

case that they're citing to is Thompson, and in Thompson

6

what occurred in that case is that the litigant in that

7

case -

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The case that I'm reading

from is the concurring opinion in Carlisle against
United States.

It does cite Thompson.

MR. MARSHALL:

Thompson is the case,

12

Thompson -- this Court has not relied on the unique

13

circumstances doctrine in 40 years.

14

what occurred was the Petitioner requested a new trial

15

untimely, but was told by the court that they had timely

16

requested a new trial.

17

they were entitled to a new trial, they did not do

18

something else, which was file the notice of appeal.

19

the court basically sent them down the wrong avenue.

20

Here there was no wrong avenue that the court -- that

21

the litigant was being sent down.

22

Buy in Thompson

Because they were informed that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So

But they would have filed

23

that notice of appeal earlier if the judge had said,

24

your motion for a new trial is untimely.

25

the same as in this case.

The judge said:
42

Alderson Reporting Company

It seems to me
Your motion

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is timely, so you're going to have the trigger so much

2

later.

3

untimely and you know you've got to get your notice of

4

appeal in sooner rather than later.

5

judge said, well, you've got until 17 days later.

6

Fine.

If the judge had said, your motion is

Similarly, here the

If the judge had done right and said the

7

14-day period, then surely Mr. Mancino would have filed

8

within that period.

9

MR. MARSHALL:

But, Your Honor, there is

10

nothing that the court did that prevented the litigant

11

here from filing on time.

12

have prevented the litigation here from filing within

13

the 14-day period.

There was nothing that would

And when -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

There was nothing in

Thompson that prevented filing the notice of appeal.

17

MR. MARSHALL:

Except in Thompson, Your

18

Honor, he was told that he had the right to proceed on a

19

motion for new trial.

20

that my time is up.

21
22
23

If he had -- Your Honor, I see

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can finish your

answer.
MR. MARSHALL:

In Thompson, Your Honor, the

24

difference is that -- that the litigant was sent down a

25

different road which was inconsistent with his filing a
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

notice of appeal.

2

about filing a notice within 14 days as opposed to 17

3

days.

Here there is nothing inconsistent

Mr. Marshall.

MR. MARSHALL:

THE COURT:

12

Thank you,

Thank you, Your Honor.

We'll hear from Mr. Stewart.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MR. STEWART:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court.

13

For four basic reasons the deadline for

14

filing a notice of appeal in a civil case should be

15

treated as jurisdictional and therefore as nonwaivable.

16

First, the time limit sent forth in Section 2107

17

directly implicates the concerns that underlie the

18

special treatment of jurisdictional issues.

19

fundamental precept of our legal system that Federal

20

courts should take special care to avoid adjudicating

21

cases where Congress has not authorized them to do so.

22

Or to put it another way, our legal system has

23

presupposed that the unauthorized exercise of

24

jurisdiction is an error different in kind from the

25

misapplication of law in cases that a court is
44
Alderson Reporting Company

It's a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

authorized to adjudicate.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Stewart, do you think

3

this is subject -- that question is subject matter

4

jurisdiction?

5

MR. STEWART:

We would -- we would

6

characterize it as a species of appellate jurisdiction.

7

That is, this Court has often said that it's the

8

fundamental duty of this Court when doubt is -- when

9

doubt is apparent, to inquire into its own jurisdiction

10

and that of the court from which the record comes.

11

that division presupposes that there are cases over

12

which the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction,

13

over which this Court would not have appellate

14

jurisdiction.

15

And

For example, situations sometimes arise,

16

particularly in cases that are adjudicated by

17

three-judge district courts, in which there is a dispute

18

as to whether a particular district court order is

19

directly appealable to this Court or should go instead

20

to the court of appeals.

21

Court and this Court determines that the appeal should

22

have gone to the court of appeals instead, the error is

23

characterized as one of appellate jurisdiction.

24

Court lacks jurisdiction to review the ruling even

25

though there's nothing to suggest that the case as a

And if somebody comes to this

45
Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whole fell outside the subject matter jurisdiction of

2

the district court.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Stewart, that's one

4

those interesting examples.

5

case but we have power to order it refiled, to vacate

6

the order and have it refiled, don't we?

7

MR. STEWART:

We lack jurisdiction of the

That is an anomaly.

The Court

8

has said on occasion that because it lacks appellate

9

jurisdiction it has no power to do anything with the

10

case except to vacate the order.

11

court that I'm not going to try to explain.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. STEWART:

And I think that's a

But I think Mr. Marshall has

14

identified the second example, namely the final decision

15

requirement of 28 USC 1291.

16

conceded to be a jurisdictional rule, even though it has

17

nothing to do with whether the district court had

18

subject matter jurisdiction over the case.

19

whether this particular decision over -- for which

20

review is sought falls within the appellate jurisdiction

21

of the court of appeals.

22
23
24
25

That is, that's universally

It is simply

And our point -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Stewart, should we

repudiate the unique circumstances doctrine?
MR. STEWART:

I don't think you need to -- I

think you should repudiate any conception that Federal
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

courts have freewheeling authority to excuse

2

noncompliance with statutory time limits for taking

3

appeals.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the unique

5

circumstances doctrine is one circumstance in which

6

courts, say yeah, you can excuse it.

7

MR. STEWART:

Well, I -- I think actually

8

both Harris and Thompson are explicable on other

9

grounds.

10
11

And may even be correct in more limited ways.

For example, Harris JUSTICE SOUTER:

But on the grounds for

12

which they have been taken as authority, is it your view

13

that we should repudiate those grounds?

14

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

With respect to civil

15

cases for which the time for taking an appeal is

16

specified by statute, it's our view to the extent that

17

Harris and Thompson would otherwise support the

18

proposition that district courts may excuse

19

noncompliance with the time limits, those cases should

20

be repudiated.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. STEWART:

Well -- in criminal.

In criminal cases the time for

23

taking an appeal is not specified by statute.

24

imposed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b).

25

But there's no statutory basis for it.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

There was up

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

until 1988 a provision of Title 18 of the U.S. Code,

2

Section 3772, that specifically authorized this Court to

3

promulgate rules that would establish the time for

4

filing a notice of appeal -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But in -- though of course,

6

you'd have to confine it very narrowly, I take that

7

doctrine, if there weren't a statute, you read it into

8

the rule.

9

statute as saying well there could be very some very

So there is a statute and you read the

10

narrow circumstances that Congress would have been

11

willing to make an exception.

12

couple of days and the judge tells you, "do it" or lets

13

you do it.

14

For example it is a

It's roughly the same thing, isn't it?
MR. STEWART:

Well I think it makes a

15

fundamental difference that there is a statute in place.

16

And certainly with respect to circuit certiorari

17

petitions coming from the court of appeals to this

18

Court, this Court has recognized that distinction to be

19

fundamental.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're sure habeas

21

cases are classified for this purpose as civil rather

22

than criminal?

23

MR. STEWART:

Yes, there's no -- no dispute

24

about that.

And indeed if the -- if this case were

25

classified as civil for purposes of -- I mean, as
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

criminal for purposes of the time limit for taking an

2

appeal, it would have been far out of time under Federal

3

Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b).

4

of the district court to have granted the reopening

5

period 180 days later wouldn't have been present in the

6

criminal context.

7

Indeed the authority

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Looking at the rule,

8

it does require these findings.

Has that been

9

interpreted to require that they be written on the

10

record or is that simply something that's supposed to

11

guide the district court?

12

MR. STEWART:

I think the courts of appeals

13

have not required that they be written on the record but

14

have required that there be a basis appearing in the

15

record for those findings.

16

Petitioner's counsel had filed a document asking to

17

reopen in the time, but had not represented that he had

18

not been informed of the judgment, then I think that if

19

the court had granted the reopening, that could be set

20

aside on appeal on the ground that there was no support

21

in the record for such a finding.

22

the courts of appeals have required there be explicit

23

findings as opposed to findings that are implicit in the

24

grant of the reopening.

25

So, for instance, if

But I don't believe

The point I was going to make about the
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certiorari petitions is that this Court's Rule 13.1

2

imposes a 90-day limit for filing a cert petition in all

3

cases.

4

But this Court has recognized that the 90-day limit has

5

a very different status is criminal cases than in civil

6

cases.

7

states that when a cert petition is jurisdictionally out

8

of time, the clerk is directed not to file it.

9

13.2 cites USC 21.01(c).

10

It is not divided between civil and criminal.

That is Rule 13.2 of the rules of this Court

And Rule

So the clear implication is that the Court

11

recognizes the time limit imposed by statute in civil

12

cases to be a jurisdictional limit.

13

point of Rule 13.2 is not simply that it uses the word

14

jurisdictionally.

15

the clerk not to file the petition regardless of whether

16

any other party objects.

17

that a court will do as to matters of its jurisdiction,

18

as to matters over which it has an obligation to take

19

cognizance, regardless of the other party's objection.

20

And the crucial

It's that it gives an instruction to

It's the very type of thing

In criminal cases by contrast the 90-day

21

rule applies under the rules, but the Court has

22

recognized that it retains the authority to grant

23

petitions that are untimely filed even in cases where

24

the other party objects.

25

The other thing I would say about 2107(a)
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and it's -- part of it is reprinted at page 16 of the

2

Government's brief.

3

16, it says, the basic time limit for appeals in similar

4

cases is set by 28 U.S.C 2107(a), which states that -

5

and then the part we haven't reproduced says except as

6

otherwise provided in this section.

7

In the last full paragraph of page

And then it goes on to say no appeal shall

8

bring any judgment order or decree in an action, suit or

9

proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals

10

for review unless notice of appeal is filed within 30

11

days.

12

And the significance of this provision, this

13

language, is it doesn't simply say a notice of appeal

14

must be filed within 30 days.

15

conceivably leave open the question of what happens if

16

the notice of appeal is untimely filed.

17

actually says if a notice of appeal is not filed within

18

30 days, the appeal will not bring the judgment -

19
20
21
22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This language

But it begins with the

exception as provided in subparagraph (c).
MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

So we're not

saying that the 30-day limit is absolute -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

MR. STEWART:

25

Language like that would

Yeah.

-- but we're saying that the

rule specifies that if the various time restrictions are
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not complied with, the appeal will not bring -- I'm

2

sorry, the appeal shall not bring the judgment, order,

3

or decree before the court of appeals.

4

specifically framed as a limitation on the authority of

5

the reviewing court.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is

What do you think, if we

7

did go to Thompson and looked at that, this would be a

8

fortiori from Thompson, as described in Osterneck, was a

9

case in which the judge simply said from the bench look,

10

your -- your -- the new trial motion is timely, though

11

it wasn't; it was out of by two days.

12

have a formal court order, it is a formal order entered

13

with a -- you know, stamp of the judge, and it says you

14

have till the 27th to file.

15

MR. STEWART:

While here, we

Well, are two things we would

16

say about Thompson.

17

explained in its recent decision in Hibbs versus Winn,

18

it's long been recognized that a timely motion for

19

reconsideration will suspend the finality of the

20

judgment and toll the time for taking an appeal.

21

the Court in Hibbs versus Winn further explained that

22

under certain circumstances, even an untimely motion for

23

reconsideration will have that effect, if the judge

24

appropriately considers it on the merits.

25

The first is that as this Court

And

And Thompson can be explained as holding
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

simply that where the Government does not object and the

2

district court evinces an intent to treat the motion as

3

timely and consider it on the merits, it will suspend

4

the finality of the judgment I don't think Thompson has

5

to read -- has to be read to stand for a broader

6

equitable principle.

7

The other thing I'd say about Thompson is

8

that for better or for worse, the Government's brief in

9

opposition in Thompson, and the case was decided on the

10

cert papers, didn't cite 28 U.S.C. 2107; it relied

11

exclusively on the time limit that was stated in the

12

Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure.

13

Court in Thompson was not required to grapple with

14

congressionally imposed limits.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

21

MR. MANCINO:

If this were a case where

22

someone just missed the 30-day deadline, I don't think

23

we would be talking.

24

a judge properly found, properly ruled that notice was

25

not given and had the authority to reopen the case.

We are talking about a case where

53
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

we talk about mandatory and jurisdiction of the case.

2

All that were involved in this case is how is the case

3

moved from one court to another.

4

And the -- was it moved properly in this

5

case?

The unique circumstances, I think you cannot find

6

a more compelling case for unique circumstances.

7

Did the party rely upon the court?

Here you

8

have a handwritten notation from the court, signed by

9

the judge -

10
11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

record tell us how you got notice of that order?

12

MR. MANCINO:

13

did get notice of it.

14

doesn't -

15
16

Mr. Mancino, does the

No, it doesn't.

But I mean, I

It came in the mail, but it

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You, you got that order in

the mail?

17

MR. MANCINO:

In the mail, correct.

And

18

that's why I believe the three days was added, thinking

19

of the mail rule that we have three additional days to

20

do it in connection with the case.

21

believe the, how the 17 days came up.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's how I

And I asked this once

23

before:

Did the document you received show the dates

24

that it was entered on the docket, so you knew when the

25

14 days was running from?
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. MANCINO:

No, the only information it

2

had was the printed -- the printed date by the judge.

Did not show it was entered that same day.

thing, it says entered on February 10.

6
7
8
9
10
11

MR. MANCINO:

Yeah, but in the -- in this

Yeah, that's correct.

The

docket does show that.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But how did you find out

it had been entered on February 10?

Because you did

know that at the time you filed your notice of appeal.
MR. MANCINO:

Well, I just went off what the

12

date on the -- the handwritten date on the pleading we

13

received from the court.

14
