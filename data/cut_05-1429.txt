ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Ninth Circuit's Fobian rule creates an

12

unwarranted Federal common law rule that exists outside

13

the structure of the Bankruptcy Code.

14

Code has a distinct structure.

15

has a right to an attorneys' fees valid under State law,

16

after the petition date, the date the debtor files for

17

bankruptcy, that right passes to the bankruptcy estate.

18

If a creditor has a State law right to attorneys' fees,

19

after the petition date, that right becomes a claim in

20

bankruptcy.

The Bankruptcy

For example, if a debtor

21

The Ninth Circuit's Fobian rule intercepts

22

those rights even before we get to what the Bankruptcy

23

Code provides or does to them and basically says, if

24

you're litigating Federal issues, you simply cannot have

25

a right to attorneys' fees unless the Federal law
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authorizes that right, in this case, contractual rights,

2

or alternatively rights available under State statute.

3

That, we submit, is an impermissible

4

creation of a Federal common law rule.

5

basis for it under this Court's preemption precedents.

6

There's no conflict between Federal policy and State

7

policy which would justify the creation of the rule, and

8

accordingly, it is unwarranted.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

In our

8

reply brief, we do cite to Collier, where we talk about

9

exactly that scenario and it is described.

And it

10

basically works like this.

A claim under the Bankruptcy

11

Code is defined under Section 1015.

12

any right to payment whether it's contingent or fixed,

13

matured, unmatured, et cetera.

14

literally any right to payment, when the debtor files

15

for bankruptcy, that becomes a claim.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

it's a post-petition action.

18

MR. BRUNSTAD:

The claim includes

Any right to payment,

No, no.

If the right But in my case,

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

The

19

key concept -- and this is explained clearly in Collier

20

-- is where does the right come from?

21

of a pre-petition contract, then the right is

22

pre-petition in nature, even though the fees are

23

incurred post-petition.

24

if PG&E had guaranteed its parent's debt for the $100

25

million, let's say.

If it arises out

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could you just back up

just for a second?

Supposing at the time of the

bankruptcy that the services have not been performed.

4

It's post-petition conduct by the lawyer.

5

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Right.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, in that case,

7

are you saying that routinely the lawyer recovers fees

8

in the bankruptcy case even if the debtor, the debtor

9

was insolvent?

10
11

And we're assuming insolvency in the

hypothetical, although it may not fit this case.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

Exactly, yes, Justice

12

Stevens, if in fact, though, the creditor bothers to

13

assert the claim for fees in the bankruptcy case.

14

most cases, creditors don't, because it's not worth the

15

effort of asserting the claim for fees subsequently.

16

cases such as this, where you have a solvent debtor who

17

can pay all claims in full, there's no reason why they

18

should be able to get out of their contractual

19

obligations in bankruptcy.

In most

Official - Subject to Final Review

cases, Justice Stevens, creditors don't even hire

2

attorneys to pursue or file a claim in bankruptcy.

3

most Chapter 7 cases, for example, they are no-asset

4

cases.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you telling me just

6

based on your experience that in Justice Kennedy's

7

hypothetical, normally, no fees are recovered?

8

MR. BRUNSTAD:

In

Normally, there's no

distribution on unsecured claims in most bankruptcy
cases.

So why bother?
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But assuming in those

12

cases where there's some distribution, is it correct, as

13

I'm assuming your answer to Justice Kennedy's question,

14

that the normal practice is you don't bother because

15

there is not enough involved?

16

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Typically, Justice Stevens,

17

that is correct.

18

attorneys' fees are substantial, the debtor is solvent,

19

and there are substantial -

20

But in cases such as this, where the

But if it is defined as

broadly as this, we're in a situation exactly like this.

There has been no default on the obligation, and prior

20

to getting to this Court, $167,000 has been racked up in

21

legal fees that accomplishes absolutely nothing.

22

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Absolutely false, Justice

23

Souter.

In bankruptcy, if you do not present your

24

rights, if the rights of the workers themselves are not

properly treated, they are lost.

Under Section 1141,

never a time that the plan said we are not going to pay

MR. BRUNSTAD:

The problem, Justice

Ginsburg, is that the plan said nothing at all.

bankruptcy is that rights are extinguished; they are

That is why one must come to the bankruptcy

21

That's why the surety here stepped forward, said it has

22

subrogation rights; the workers have rights.

23

bankruptcy court agreed with Travelers.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Travelers -

I thought there was a

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That's Section 509, Justice

Ginsburg.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes.

But that's not what I was

6

speaking of just momentarily.

employees, the workers, when they filed for -- when PG&E

filed for bankruptcy, the injured workers had claims.

They were going to receive periodic benefit payments off

11

those claims in the bankruptcy case in their plan, those

12

claims would have been extinguished.

13

though, Travelers would not have been off the hook on

its surety bond, Travelers would have had to have

stepped forward and make the payments if PG&E did not.

16

If PG&E had not properly provided for

As a result,

plan of reorganization.

is not allowed, but if it becomes fixed at some time,

In our brief, we cite to many, many cases in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

But -- but we are

talking about attorneys' fees for services performed in

18

the bankruptcy proceeding?

19

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The cost of filing the

21

claim, the cost of talking to the bankruptcy judge, et

were properly part of the unsecured claim, but it

couldn't be any clearer.

And the Second Circuit -

But again this is a rational

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do we

If it is a rational

10

predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in

11

the opposition to certiorari.

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

I

13

apologize for focusing only on the issue that Travelers

14

was focusing on, which was whether this was, whether the

15

Fobian rule was itself cert-worthy question.

16

a rational predicate because, as you can see from

17

Travelers' brief, Travelers says no fewer than a dozen

18

times, including in two point headings:

19

read the code.

20

creditors have an allowable claim for post-petition

21

attorneys' fees, and only if you begin by reading the

code can you figure out whether the Fobian common law

overlay is correct or not.

5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, we do have

affirmative harm that can come from this Court simply

saying, let us conclude that the Ninth Circuit was wrong

in disallowing these claims on the logic that the Ninth

Circuit followed, but we will reserve for a later day an

21

open question of law on what Section 502(b) and 506(b)

22

means.

23

overwhelmingly the lower courts in the last 10 years

24

have concluded that 502(b) and 506(b) mean that

25

unsecured creditors do not have these claims.

And the harm comes from the fact that

If this Court declares that it is now an
open question -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

contract provides that.

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

impair the rights of the general creditors at all.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That's one logic of the -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If that's so, why isn't

19

their argument that, well, your client is solvent, the

20

complete answer to your position?

21

MR. SHORR:

Well, Your Honor, because

22

Congress didn't say that.

Congress gave only one answer

23

to the question whether unsecured creditors get their

24

attorneys' fees allowed, that is post-petition

25

attorneys' fees allowed.

It's either yes or no.
30

Alderson Reporting Company

There

is no on-off switch for solvent or insolvent creditors

2

within the code, which is why Travelers never argued

that as a, an objection to the plan of confirmation.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They argue it in their

reply brief here.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor, and that

7

is absolutely incorrect.

If you look at the case that

8

they cite, that case relies on a provision of the code,

9

which is Section 726.

And Section 726 is only about

post-petition interest for solvent debtors, not

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, how do you avoid -

what about their statement from Collier?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the statement

that Travelers quotes from Collier is about a

proposition that we don't dispute, which is whether it

17

is a pre-petition claim.

18

But Collier.

It said -- a

The answer under the code is

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's because 506

2

how to deal with secured claims.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That doesn't -- and then

5

you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius

6

argument, whatever, which I think is misplaced in this

7

context.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, Congress put

506(b) in the code for one purpose and one purpose only,

Do any of them involve attorneys' fees simply

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, as to

17

creditors, four of them apply to attorneys' fees as

18

administrative expenses.

19

because the code says and it adopts this age old rule

20

that if you are going to take money away from some

21

unsecured creditors and give it to attorneys it better

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, for the, for

Four of them

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, so six.

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So six are administrative,

collect it as an unsecured debt?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which are those two?

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, one of them does.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which is that?

That is the provision that

this, but I mean, if we were to say Fobian is wrong,

everybody will agree with us.

Your proposed solution here doesn't address the issue in

DeRoche because there it's the debtor that's seeking

attorneys' fees.

5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So we still have to

7

decide the Fobian issue.

And your failure to defend it

8

here means that we're going to have to decide in on that

9

inadequate record.

If you have mentioned that in an

10

opposition to certiorari, perhaps we would have granted

11

cert in the DeRoche case and had an argument about the

12

rule that we have to decide.

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, I appreciate

14

that, and I apologize for not having raised it in the

15

cert petition, cert opposition, we were simply focused

16

on why it is that this little sliver of the Fobian rule

provision for attorneys' fees that you're relying on.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, no, Your Honor.

We've been talking about why the only natural way to

read the code is to disallow attorneys' fees, and I'm

explaining that if attorneys' fees are generally

disallowed to everyone, there's no exception to that

otherwise.

What I'm saying

is 502(b) when you read "as of the time of the filing of

5

that it doesn't apply to post-petition attorneys' fees,

this Court did in Timbers, of the rest of the code.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

with Colliers, but I don't think Colliers comes out one

refer the Court to page 24a of the -- of the cert

there is an asterisk eliminating a paragraph.

would develop on remand.

2

But all of their arguments about Section

Congress did not think there was a

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Justice Stevens, what I take,

2

what I take from their analysis is a hostility towards

3

attorneys' fees being allowed in bankruptcy.

4

perhaps maybe as a matter of policy, if we were to start

5

from scratch, well, maybe we shouldn't allow attorneys'

6

fees to be allowed in bankruptcy.

7

allow tort claims to be allowed in bankruptcy.

8

shouldn't allow certain kinds of environmental claims to

Yes, Justice Stevens.

dramatically since then.
