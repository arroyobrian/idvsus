            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

5

Raymore.

6

            Mr. Duggan.

7

              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DUGGAN

8

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

            MR. DUGGAN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court:

11

            Persons who jointly and severally agree to

12

repay the appliedfor debt are applicants under ECOA.

13

And that is precisely what occurred here.  My clients

14

were required, in violation of Regulation B in ECOA as

15

spousal guarantors, to become jointly and severally

16

liable to repay the debts of their husbands' business,

17

which clearly qualifies them as applicants both under

18

the straightforward language of ECOA, as well as the

19

Regulation B that was adopted by the regulators.

20

            In this particular instance, as in many

21

credit transactions, the real applicants in this

22

transaction are not a tobe formed limited liability

23

company or corporation, but the persons that will stand

24

as guarantors behind that company.

25

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Didn't the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

Reserve Board originally, I think, in 1977 take the

2

opposite position and said explicitly that applicant

3

excludes guarantors?

4

            MR. DUGGAN:  Your Honor  Your Honor, with

5

regard to that position that was taken by the FDIC in

6

1977, they were responding to claims by the industry

7

that they did not want applicants broadly defined to

8

include guarantors for notice provisions.  And in

9

response to that, the regulation was crafted in a way

10

that did, in fact, address that concern, but it was

11

never intended to eliminate the potential claims for

12

spousal guarantors.

13

            When the case law came down and said we're

14

relying on the Regulation B of 1977, according to what

15

the regulators adopted then in 1985 they said, we were

16

mistaken.  We've been misinterpreted about what our

17

intent was.  We  we now need to modify the regulation

18

and make it clear that those persons who were

19

discriminated against based on marital status have the

20

right to bring the claim.

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have to give notice

22

to  to guarantors now?

23

            MR. DUGGAN:  No, you do not, Your Honor.

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, how can that be?  I

25

mean, they're either applicants or they're not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5

applicants.

2

            MR. DUGGAN:  Well, I think 

3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If they're applicants, you

4

have to give them notice.

5

            MR. DUGGAN:  I think the 

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying they're

7

applicants for one purpose, they're not applicants for

8

another?

9

            MR. DUGGAN:  Yeah, in this case 

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The agency can make that

11

up?

12

            MR. DUGGAN:  Well, I think the Court has

13

already ruled in the Duke Energy case that regulators,

14

in appropriate circumstances, can even take a defined

15

term under the statute, in that case the term

16

"modification," and cause it to mean different things in

17

different subsections.

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I never liked that case.

19

            MR. DUGGAN:  My apologies.

20

            (Laughter.)

21

            MR. DUGGAN:  What  what happened in this

22

case, Your Honor, was very, very reasonable by the

23

regulators.  They came out in 1985 

24

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Just out of curiosity, why

25

 well, everybody agrees that PHC Development is an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

applicant, right?

2

            MR. DUGGAN:  Agreed.

3

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Why didn't PHC Development

4

sue and claim that requiring the guaranties was in

5

violation of the law?

6

            MR. DUGGAN:  At that point in time, the case

7

law that had developed so far, and the Regulation B,

8

made it clear that the spouses had standing to bring the

9

claim, and the spouses were the ones that asserted the

10

claim.

11

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why does it matter, if

12

there's always somebody to bring a claim?  In what set

13

of cases does the answer to this question matter?

14

            MR. DUGGAN:  I think it's important for

15

several reasons.  First of all, spouses who are required

16

to sign jointly and severally with their husbands'

17

businesses and their husbands are going to undertake

18

potential adverse credit consequences in the future.

19

            Let me give you an example.  Divorce or

20

death of the primary operator of the business.  If the

21

wife has become jointly and severally liable to repay

22

the husband's debt, she then is going to be strapped

23

with his credit profile in a business that she never had

24

any operational authority, that she never was involved

25

in, and she wasn't an investor on.  She was simply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

required to sign because she was the spouse of the

2

husband.  And what's important to understand in these

3

cases 

4

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait, wait, wait.  You say

5

she was required to sign.  She wasn't required to sign.

6

Somebody put a gun to her head?  She wanted the husband

7

to get the loan, and this was the deal.

8

            MR. DUGGAN:  And I think that's exactly what

9

the regulators 

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, but don't talk about

11

it as she was required to sign.  She was not required to

12

sign.

13

            MR. DUGGAN:  There was a requirement placed

14

upon 

15

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  If he  if he was to get

16

the loan, he had to get her to sign, but she was not

17

required to sign.

18

            MR. DUGGAN:  I'd agree.  She signed the

19

guaranty by virtue of a condition being placed upon the

20

extension of credit to her husband and the lend  and

21

the borrowing entity.  And what's important to

22

understand is that in these cases, these borrowing

23

entities, and in this very case, which typifies these

24

small business organizations, that, in fact, it's never

25

really the "tobe formed limited liability company"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

that's the borrower, it's always the guarantors.

2

            We need to look no farther than Doc 797,

3

Page 1 to 3, which is the bank's actual approval of this

4

credit application.  In that document, which was a part

5

of the trial court record, the bank, in responding to

6

its own internal writeup on the operating history and

7

the potential for the entity to pay back the debt, it

8

said "nonapplicable."  Financial projections of the

9

borrowing entity?  "Nonapplicable."

10

            The precise reason to approve the loan, "I

11

recommend approval of this loan request based on the

12

financial strength of the guarantors and our collateral

13

position."  The only collateral that was ever taken in

14

that transaction was the collateral of the guarantors.

15

To suggest that guarantors are not the real applicants

16

in these loan transactions is to be divorced from

17

reality.  They are the true applicants.

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let's  let's  let's

19

assume that I  I write a letter of recommendation for

20

some  some young woman who is applying to a law

21

school, or to a college.  I would really like her to be

22

admitted, and I've written a letter of recommendation to

23

sort of put my judgment, my reputation on the line on

24

her behalf.  Am I an applicant to the law school?

25

            MR. DUGGAN:  No.

Alderson Reporting Company

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Would anybody use the

2

English language that way?

3

            MR. DUGGAN:  Well, I believe, in that

4

context, that person is not agreeing to become jointly

5

and severally liable to pay the tuition.  They're not 

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What difference does it

7

make?  Instead of putting my financial solvency on the

8

line, I put my reputation on the line.

9

            MR. DUGGAN:  Well, I think it's very

10

important, because the regulators made a reasonable

11

interpretation under their broad grant of authority that

12

when they're required, when a condition is placed upon

13

the approval, that they have to come forward and be

14

contractually obligated to repay the appliedfor debt,

15

they are an applicant.

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  They are not applying.

17

It's  it's their husband who's applying, and they

18

don't have to  or  or it's a company that's

19

applying.  They don't have to go in.  It's up to them.

20

            MR. DUGGAN:  The guaranties in this case

21

have specific requirements for independent performance

22

by the guarantors, such as providing financial

23

statements, repaying the debt, paying their debts on

24

time, honoring all their obligations with the lender.

25

If they breach one single obligation that's independent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

to their guaranty, they're obligated to repay the debt

2

in full, and 

3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That doesn't show 

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What if I have a child, and

5

I apply for that child to be admitted to the XYZ public

6

school for which I will pay  a private school, for

7

which I will pay the tuition.  Am I an applicant?

8

            MR. DUGGAN:  I don't think so.

9

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You don't think so?

10

            MR. DUGGAN:  I think in part you may be, but

11

my  my contention 

12

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Wait, wait, wait.  This was

13

a favorable question.  I thought it's obvious that when

14

a parent applies 

15

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, you shouldn't  you

16

shouldn't have asked that.

17

            (Laughter.)

18

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I have a parent that

19

applies for 

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You and I share that

21

concern.

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What?  Wait.  A parent

23

applies for a child, her child, to be admitted to a

24

school which she will pay.  The child is seven years old

25

and has a hard time writing the application.

Alderson Reporting Company

11
1

            (Laughter.)

2

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Isn't it normal for us to

3

refer to the parent as the applicant, even though the

4

child doesn't?

5

            MR. DUGGAN:  Yes.

6

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And it is not normal for us

7

to refer to the applicant for college as the parent,

8

even though, unfortunately, the parent foots the bill?

9

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Was this corporation a

10

minor?

11

            MR. DUGGAN:  What?

12

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The corporation that

13

applied, was it a minor?

14

            MR. DUGGAN:  No, but the point 

15

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Change the  the

16

sevenyearold to a young man who is applying to law

17

school, who is already shaving, for Pete's sake.

18

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But my point 

19

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is Justice Breyer the

20

applicant?

21

            MR. DUGGAN:  He may.

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I think our point for both

23

of us is that how we use the word "applicant" depends

24

upon the context.

25

            MR. DUGGAN:  Very true.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And, therefore, what is it

2

about the context of the guarantor of a loan that makes

3

it reasonable in that context to call that person an

4

applicant?

5

            MR. DUGGAN:  Let me answer that question

6

directly.

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I don't agree with

8

the hypothesis.  Why do you accept the hypothesis?  What

9

it means depends upon the  upon the context?  It means

10

what it means.  Now, whether the person is an applicant

11

within the understood meaning of "applicant," that

12

depends upon the context, but the meaning of the word

13

doesn't change.

14

            MR. DUGGAN:  May I address the questions,

15

Mr. Chief Justice?

16

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's all right

17

with me.

18

            (Laughter.)

19

            MR. DUGGAN:  Thank you so much.

20

            The definition of the word "apply" is to

21

appeal to a request.  And in this particular case, I

22

believe that anybody who signs a written contract that

23

says, I have independent obligations to perform under my

24

guaranty that make me jointly and severally liable to

25

repay the debt in full, and if I fail to perform, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

agree to repay the appliedfor debt in totality, I don't

2

know how in the world that person is not somebody who is

3

appealing to and requesting that credit be extended by

4

putting their own financial wherewithal and capacity to

5

repay the loan on the line based on their own

6

independent requirement to perform.

7

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Under your  under your

8

view  let me understand the theory of the case.  Let's

9

say that you prevail, that a guarantor is an applicant

10

and that there is a violation of the duty to the

11

guarantor and that there are five guarantors.  Can each

12

of the five guarantors bring a separate suit for

13

punitive damages?  And also  this is also part of my

14

question  can the loan be declared unenforceable?

15

            MR. DUGGAN:  No, the loan cannot be declared

16

unenforceable under the laws that exist today.  The only

17

thing that could be declared unenforceable would be the

18

spousal guaranties which are deemed illegal under

19

Regulation B.  Not all of the guarantors can bring a

20

claim.  The husbands can only bring a claim to the

21

extent they suffer damage as a result of their wives

22

being required to be guarantors on the case.

23

            Mr. Chief Justice, I see that my time is

24

limited.  I may like to reserve the remainder for

25

rebuttal, if there are no further questions.

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.

            MR. DUGGAN:  Thank you so much.

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER

4

              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5

            MR. FLETCHER:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

6

and may it please the Court:

7

            For 30 years, Regulation B has provided that

8

guarantors, cosigners, and other similar parties to

9

credit transactions, qualify as applicants, are entitled

10

to protection from discrimination under the Equal Credit

11

Opportunity Act and the Additional Parties rule.  That

12

longstanding regulation is reasonable, and it reflects a

13

reasonable interpretation of the Act's broad definition

14

of the term "applicant."

15

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, we've been

16

talking about applicants  is it  is the person an

17

applicant in the abstract?  But one of the important

18

things about context here is there are two terms,

19

"applicant" and "guarantor."  And that's the way it's

20

always worked in the industry.  Somebody in the industry

21

would not call a guarantor an applicant.  The person is

22

a guarantor.  So I just wonder how we can pluck

23

"applicant" out.  Obviously, in some sense, anybody who

24

is supporting the loan, you know, you can describe,

25

well, they're applying for it.  But there's a separate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

term, "guarantor."  And if you ask somebody, well, what

2

is this person?  Is this person an applicant?  They

3

would say, no, it's a guarantor.

4

            MR. FLETCHER:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the

5

term "guarantor" doesn't appear in the statute.  And I

6

don't think it's true that the term "applicant" and

7

"guarantor" have fixed meanings in the industry and that

8

you could never construe a guarantor to be an applicant.

9

I think, in fact, often, as we explain in our brief,

10

guarantors and cosigners might fill out the same

11

application and join together in the same application

12

that they submit to the borrower in seeking the loan.

13

And so I  I don't think there's an industry

14

understanding that you can't reasonably regard a

15

guarantor or a cosigner or another secondary obligor

16

who's playing that sort of 

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Wait.  Do you think

18

there's an industry understanding that there are

19

guarantors and there are applicants?  I mean, if you

20

weren't in the industry and you're looking at this, you

21

wouldn't call the Petitioner an applicant.  You'd call

22

her a guarantor.

23

            MR. FLETCHER:  I think you  in

24

some  certainly, in some context, you might use the

25

two terms differently.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Wouldn't you

2

call  wouldn't you use the word "borrower" instead of

3

applicant?

4

            MR. FLETCHER:  I think certainly after the

5

loan had been extended, you would  you would use the

6

term "borrower."  But I think if you look at the  the

7

context in which Congress used the term, it wrote a very

8

broad statute.  It said, "It shall be unlawful for any

9

creditor to discriminate against any applicant with

10

respect to any aspect of a credit transaction."  And

11

then it defined an applicant to be any person who

12

applies to a creditor directly for an extension,

13

renewal, or continuation of credit.

14

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Would you disagree that in

15

ordinary speech, an applicant is understood, as

16

Judge Colloton said, to be someone who is asking for

17

something for himself or herself?  And if you don't

18

agree with that, could you give me your best example of

19

the situation in ordinary speech in which the term

20

"applicant" is used to refer to someone who is not

21

asking for something personally?

22

            MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Alito, I agree that

23

very often, applicant refers to the person who's going

24

to receive the thing that's being sought.  I don't

25

think, though  and this is what the other side has to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

convince you of  that it unambiguously excludes any

2

other meaning.  And in terms of my best examples in

3

terms of ordinary speech, I think the one that

4

Justice Breyer gave earlier was a good one.

5

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, let me come back to

6

that.  Suppose that this child is rejected for

7

kindergarten, and then the parent is glum the next day

8

at work.  And someone says, why are you down today?

9

Would the  would the parent say, well, I'm down today

10

because I was just rejected for this fancy kindergarten?

11

            MR. FLETCHER:  I think you wouldn't say I

12

was rejected, but you might 

13

            JUSTICE ALITO:  My application was rejected.

14

            MR. FLETCHER:  I think you very well might.

15

I think if you filled out the application, and you made

16

the request, and you were upset that it was denied, I

17

think it would be perfectly sensible to say my

18

application was denied.

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Fletcher, in  in some

20

ways, the Agency itself has admitted that this is not

21

the most natural reading of the term.  When the Agency

22

explained why it was articulating this rule, it said,

23

well, the problem is that Section 706 of the Act confers

24

standing to sue only upon an aggrieved applicant.  And

25

so we have to come in and kind of fix that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

            And  and so, too, the regulation itself

2

talks about applicants and additional parties as though

3

the two are different.  And then the regulation, as I

4

think Justice Scalia said, says, well, this  this is

5

our definition of applicant, but it's really only for

6

this purpose, not throughout the statute.  And all of

7

those, it seems to me, are quasiadmissions that this is

8

not the most natural way to read the word "applicant."

9

            MR. FLETCHER:  Justice Kagan, I'm glad you

10

brought that up because I very much disagree that that's

11

how the Agency has viewed this.  I think, in particular,

12

you referred to the way that the Agency described the

13

change it was making in 1985, when it amended the

14

regulation to expressly include guarantors for certain

15

purposes.  And you're right.  They said, we're doing

16

this because courts have ruled guarantors out of court.

17

But the reason that it said that was not that it

18

believed that guarantors were unambiguously excluded by

19

the statute or that it was rewriting the statute.  It

20

did that because between 1977 and 1985, the Agency's own

21

regulation had expressly said that applicants do not

22

include guarantors, cosigners, and other similar

23

parties.  And so the courts that had said that

24

guarantors didn't get to bring a suit were pointing to

25

the Agency's regulation and says this statute only

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

protects applicants.  And the Agency is telling us

2

expressly that you as a guarantor aren't an applicant.

3

            And so the Agency came in in 1985, and it

4

said, our own regulation, our previous version of our

5

regulation, which excluded guarantors, is creating this

6

problem, and we want to fix it by defining them to be

7

applicants.

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you  you don't  you

9

don't solve a problem by  by fixing a definition.  I

10

mean, why was it a problem?  It  it was not a problem

11

if applicant meant what the prior regulation said it

12

meant.  Why was that a problem?

13

            MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think  I think it

14

was a problem because it left guarantors who had been

15

improperly required to sign loan documents without a

16

remedy.

17

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.  But that's what the

18

law read.  I mean, if that's a problem, it was a problem

19

with the law.

20

            MR. FLETCHER:  Well, that was a problem with

21

the Agency's own prior regulation, which expressly

22

excluded guarantors.  When the Agency  and let me step

23

back.

24

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can I just start?  Why

25

did you have to pass the first regulation at all?  What

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

caused you  if it was as clear as Justice Scalia

2

believes, why did you need the regulation at all saying

3

it doesn't include?

4

            MR. FLETCHER:  So if I could just give you a

5

little bit of the history of how the regulation

6

developed.  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed

7

in 1974.  When the Agency, the Federal Reserve Board,

8

first passed regulations in 1975, it just incorporated

9

the statutory definition of applicant in relevant part.

10

It didn't speak to the guarantor question one way or

11

another.

12

            But in 1976, just a year later, it added a

13

substantive provision that made clear that at that time

14

in 1976, it regarded guarantors as applicants.  It said

15

that for purposes of a provision of the

16

regulation  and this is something we cite at Page 7 of

17

our brief  for purposes of a provision of the

18

regulation, it required creditors to give notice of

19

their credit decisions to applicants.  If you have

20

multiple applicants, creditor, you can just give notice

21

to one of them.  But then the regulation provided you

22

may not give that notice to an applicant who is a

23

secondary obligor, such as a surety or a guarantor.

24

            So the Agency's first interpretation was

25

actually that the  the plain language of the statute,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

which had been incorporated into the regulation,

2

included guarantors.

3

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it correct that this

4

issue matters only where there are adverse  where

5

the  the borrower and the guarantor have adverse

6

interests?  And if that's correct, how often does that

7

arise?

8

            MR. FLETCHER:  So Justice Alito, I think

9

it's particularly important where the borrower and the

10

guarantor have adverse interests for the  for

11

instance, if there's been a divorce.  And so the

12

spouses' interests are no longer aligned.  Then I think

13

it's very, very important.  But I don't think it matters

14

only in those cases.  And this goes to  to the

15

question that Justice Kagan raised earlier, which is why

16

does this matter?

17

            And the reason that it matters is that a

18

guarantor who's improperly required to provide a

19

guaranty suffers a unique economic injury that is not

20

suffered by the applicant.  So in  in a common case,

21

the lender says, I won't extend this loan without a

22

signature from your spouse.  And everyone agrees that

23

that's a violation of Regulation B, and everyone agrees

24

that that's not permitted.

25

            And if, in that case, the spouse provides

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

the signature, as often happens, then the primary

2

applicant, the borrower, hasn't suffered any harm at

3

all.  They've gotten the loan that they wanted.  So they

4

have suffered discrimination in some sense, and they

5

would have a claim in some sense.  But in many cases,

6

they're not going to have economic damages to assert in

7

court.

8

            The guarantor, on the other hand, oftentimes

9

will have that obligation on her credit report

10

immediately.  It could adversely affect her credit

11

scores immediately.  And as we explain in our brief, if

12

there's a default on the underlying loan, then that's

13

going to be a black mark that's going to tarnish the

14

guarantor or the cosigner's credit going forward even if

15

she ultimately pays the debt.

16

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  One of the things that

17

Judge Posner said against your interpretation is that

18

this actually creates liability on a scale that Congress

19

wouldn't have expected because if you are right, the

20

guarantor can come in and  and declare the entire loan

21

invalid, and  and the damages would be much higher

22

than it is for the borrower himself.  I mean,

23

what's  what's the answer to that?

24

            MR. FLETCHER:  So I think 

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is there an answer?  It's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

just like, well, that's what it is.

2

            MR. FLETCHER:  Well, I think the  the

3

first answer is that that  the availability of that

4

remedy of allowing a guarantor to assert and actually

5

invalidate the guaranty that's been illegally required,

6

that won't be resolved one way or the other by the way

7

you answered this question today, which is just are

8

guarantors reasonably regarded as applicants as they've

9

been defined for 30 years?

10

            But  but I understand, though, why you

11

would be interested because it is a related question of

12

what remedies might guarantors have available.  And we

13

think the answer to Judge Posner's question in that case

14

is that there's nothing at all unreasonable about

15

requiring a lender that has improperly demanded a

16

guaranty to not be able to enjoy the benefit of that

17

guaranty.  As we explained at the end of our brief,

18

that's been the enforcing agency's longstanding policy

19

when the FDIC or the Federal Reserve Board or other

20

agencies conduct examinations of the books of banks and

21

when they find violations of the additional party's rule

22

like this.

23

            The remedy that they apply is to require the

24

bank to release the improper guaranty, or in cases 

25

and I think this is another important point 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

Regulation B doesn't prohibit spousal signatures under

2

all circumstances.  To the extent that what the bank

3

wants to do is ensure that in the event of a default,

4

it's going to be able to reach specific property that

5

the primary applicant is relying on, it can require a

6

signature from the spouse, not for personal liability,

7

but just to allow it to reach the property that is being

8

relied upon to support the loan.

9

            And so if 

10

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So 

11

            MR. FLETCHER:  I was just going to say, so

12

in that case, I think the proper remedy wouldn't be to

13

void the loan altogether.  It would be to give the

14

lender what it had the right to demand, which was a more

15

limited instrument.

16

            I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Can  can you explain

18

quickly  I'm now uncertain.  I accept the point that I

19

could be a rejected application for kindergarten on

20

behalf of my  I've said  I've got that.  But what is

21

this actually about?

22

            The law says you cannot discriminate against

23

a borrower, for example  for example  by saying that

24

you, the borrower, has to  have to have a guarantor

25

from someone you're married to.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

            MR. FLETCHER:  Right.

2

            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what the law says.

3

            MR. FLETCHER:  It says you can't

4

discriminate against any applicant with respect to any

5

aspect of a credit transaction.  Yes.

6

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And this has been

7

interpreted to include you cannot say to a married

8

person you have to have the marriage  the spouse sign.

9

            MR. FLETCHER:  That's correct.

10

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So that's where

11

we start.  Now, if the applicant were just the applicant

12

for the credit himself, what would be wrong with that?

13

Then you'd say, well, the person who's hurt here among

14

the people  just as if, for example, when you run a

15

train into a  into a wall, there are a lot of people

16

hurt.  So if the person  namely, the spouse  really

17

is hurt, why does  why does she have to be an

18

applicant?  Why can't you just sue for harm as a

19

result  caused as a result of the forbidden

20

discrimination?

21

            MR. FLETCHER:  So the statutory cause of

22

action gives any applicant a right to sue.

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I know.  But why wouldn't

24

you sue if you're  if you're  if you're directly

25

injured as a result of a  of an unlawful act?  Which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

is what the regulation 

2

            MR. FLETCHER:  So  and I think the

3

Petitioner has suggested that there might be State law

4

causes of action, but I think in terms of having the

5

right 

6

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Not State, just right under

7

this statute, you say I have suffered harm, I was about

8

to take this ticket, and everyone admits I would have

9

taken the money, invested in the lottery, and would

10

today be a millionaire.  Hard to prove, but nonetheless,

11

if proved, maybe she was hurt.  So why can't she sue?

12

            MR. FLETCHER:  Because the statute gives the

13

right to sue to applicant.

14

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But it doesn't say 

15

okay.  So you're 

16

            JUSTICE BREYER:  To an aggrieved  to an

17

aggrieved 

18

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  To have gotten too far,

19

and so your whole idea here is say she's an applicant,

20

too.

21

            MR. FLETCHER:  Right.

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And then she can sue.

23

            MR. FLETCHER:  She's an applicant.

24

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Now  now, it seems to me

25

maybe you're pushing the edge of the word "applicant" as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

they did intend it in the statute.  That's  that is a

2

problem.

3

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On that point 

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Can you give an example?

5

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:   are there places in

6

the  in this statute where guarantor and applicant is

7

a distinction that has to be made?  In other words,

8

under your view, does applicant include guarantor in

9

every part of the statute?

10

            MR. FLETCHER:  So in our view, there's no

11

place where reading applicant to include guarantor

12

wouldn't work or would create a problem.  What the

13

Agency has done, when it amended its regulation to

14

include guarantors, is it asked for comments on whether

15

there are specific provisions of the regulation that

16

guarantors should be exempted from.  And in response to

17

those comments, it decided to exercise its broad

18

rulemaking authority to exempt them and to not treat

19

them as applicants for purposes of other provisions of

20

the statute.  So I don't think 

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where  where does it get

22

that discretion?  I mean, it says applicant in the

23

statute.  When it says applicant, the Agency has

24

discretion to say, oh, yeah, it says applicant, but

25

sometimes we're going to ignore that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

            MR. FLETCHER:  Yes, Justice Scalia.  It's

2

under the grant of a rulemaking authority which is in

3

Section 1691(b), subsection (A).

4

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which says what?

5

            MR. FLETCHER:  Which says that, "The bureau

6

shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes

7

of this"  "this subchapter, and the regulations may

8

contain, but are not limited to, such classifications,

9

differentiation, or other provision and may provide for

10

such adjustments and exceptions for any class of

11

transaction."

12

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But have you got an

13

example?  Any example at all from a magazine having to

14

do with finance, from anything you can find where, in

15

fact, in the context of financial transactions, there

16

are references to a surety, a guarantor, or a mortgage

17

insurance, there is a reference to such a person with

18

the word "applicant"?

19

            MR. FLETCHER:  So here's my best example,

20

Justice Breyer.  They're on Page 24 of their brief  my

21

brief.  And they don't use the word "applicant," but

22

they talk about who's regarded as receiving an extension

23

of credit.  And this is our secondary argument,

24

Justice Alito.

25

            Even if you think that an applicant is only

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

someone who seeks something for themselves, we think a

2

guarantor is reasonably regarded as seeking an extension

3

of credit for themselves.  As we explain on page 24 of

4

our brief, for purposes of the Fair Credit Reporting

5

Act, lenders and other banks rely every day on reading

6

the Fair Credit Reporting Act to mean that the same

7

definition of credit  of credit, which refers to the

8

extension of credit, includes a guaranty.

9

            The authority in the Fair Credit Reporting

10

Act that allows a lender, who has a prospective

11

guarantor before him, to look at that guarantor's credit

12

report is a provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act

13

that says you can pull the credit report of someone

14

who's going to receive an extension of credit in

15

connection with the transaction.

16

            And we cite there a 2001 letter from all of

17

the banking regulators that explains in detail why it is

18

reasonable to regard guarantors and other secondary

19

obligors as receiving an extension of credit, and why,

20

in fact, that's essential to the effective

21

administration of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

22

            Thank you.

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

25

         ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2

            MR. McALLISTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

3

it please the Court:

4

            This is a Chevron step one case.  The FRB

5

gets to be the sorcerer's apprentice, but not the

6

sorcerer.  It's trying to rewrite the statute here, not

7

define ambiguous terms.  The government takes the view

8

that the statute has to unambiguously exclude

9

guarantors.  That's the wrong starting point.

10

            The question is simply:  Is the statute

11

ambiguous with respect to whom it covers?  Under the

12

government's view, every statutory definition would have

13

to have two parts; the part that defines who is an

14

applicant, and part two that says who's not an

15

applicant.

16

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. McAllister, I take it if

17

there were two borrowers, you would include both of

18

them, both would have a cause of action?

19

            MR. McALLISTER:  Absolutely.  They're  if

20

they're  if they're joint applicants, the statute 

21

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  They're joint applicants.

22

            MR. McALLISTER:   covers them.

23

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  How about if they're

24

cosigners?  I take it that  is  a cosigner is

25

somebody who's jointly and severally liable, but is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

not himself 

2

            MR. McALLISTER:  Is not an applicant.

3

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   receiving the money.

4

            MR. McALLISTER:  Exactly.  So 

5

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  You would  you would count

6

that out.

7

            MR. McALLISTER:  Count that out.  They 

8

they are not an applicant.  So the statute refers to

9

applicants, and certainly, the regs and the statute

10

contemplate the joint applicants who go in together.

11

They want the credit together, and they have an

12

obligation to make the repayments, either or both.  But

13

a cosigner is different.

14

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And this is so even if the

15

cosigner had to file the exact same kind of papers and

16

do everything else that the borrower himself had to do?

17

            MR. McALLISTER:  Exactly.  And  and part

18

of that is because of the statute's definition of

19

credit, which no one has talked about.  But the

20

statute's definition of credit, that is defined

21

explicitly just like applicant.  And it's part of the

22

applicant definition.  And credit means a right to defer

23

payment of debt.  A cosigner and a guarantor never have

24

a right to defer payment of debt.  If they become

25

responsible, they were responsible then.  So what that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

is contemplating, in our view, is the borrower.  It's

2

the person who's making the regular payments.  That's

3

what's encompassed in the statutory definition.

4

            I would refer the Court also to comparable

5

civil rights statutes of this era.  In particular, the

6

Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the AIDS

7

Discrimination and Employment Act.  All of them use the

8

word "person" to describe who can bring a claim.  In the

9

ECOA, Congress very deliberately chose something

10

narrower, and not only did it choose it, but it

11

expressly defined it in the statute.

12

            And we describe this as a gateway provision.

13

We don't argue that the Fed doesn't have broad authority

14

in many respects in implementing the ECOA.  But what it

15

does not have the authority to do is to rewrite the

16

statutory definition that Congress very deliberately and

17

precisely put in the statute.

18

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So suppose  suppose that I

19

have a credit card, and now I get married, and I'd like

20

a secondary credit card for my spouse, and I apply to

21

the credit card company for a secondary credit card.

22

Who's  who's the applicant there?

23

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I think you are still

24

the applicant there.

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So even though I receive no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

direct benefit, the credit is actually given to my

2

spouse now?

3

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, if they have the

4

ability to charge on the account same as you, then I

5

guess they would, in effect, become a joint applicant at

6

that point in time.

7

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  They would effectively

8

become a joint applicant, even though I'm the only one

9

who's filling out the  the  all the papers.

10

            MR. McALLISTER:  But the statute

11

contemplates that there can be situations in which a

12

thirdparty requests credit on behalf of another, and

13

that's another reason why we think guarantors are not

14

included because it is contemplating, for example, the

15

parent who goes in, says I want to arrange a loan for my

16

son or daughter to buy their first car.  The son or

17

daughter is actually ultimately going to be the

18

applicant.  The parent may well be a cosigner.  The

19

parent may initiate the transaction, but the  the

20

recipient of the credit, the right to defer payment of

21

the debt, is an applicant.

22

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess  I guess  you

23

know  and this is a  a functional point for sure.

24

But it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense that

25

suppose a lender doesn't want to provide credit to a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

married woman because it has all these sex, gender

2

stereotypes in the lender's head or  and the lender

3

couldn't require that the  that the husband be listed

4

as a  a joint applicant, but could require that the

5

husband be listed as a cosigner, even though the effect

6

of those two things are exactly the same, which is that

7

it's a requirement that the spouse essentially become

8

joint and severally liable for the loan.

9

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I  I don't think

10

there is a difference.  I think the cosigner is in the

11

same category as the guarantor.  But here's  here's my

12

fundamental answer to your question, Justice Kagan, is

13

the purpose of this statute is abundantly evident.  The

14

language we think, but if you look at the legislative

15

history, the point was to get the credit in the hands of

16

people who were being denied, in particular, women.

17

That is the applicant.  So the way the statute is

18

intended to work, and works just fine with the

19

definition of applicant we use, is to say when that

20

person shows up, and the bank says, oh, no credit for

21

you unless a spouse signs, the violation has occurred

22

then.  And the discrimination is against the person who

23

wanted to borrow the money.  The government may wish

24

that the discriminatory provisions were broader than

25

that, but that's the way the statute works.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

            So the applicant has a claim, the borrower

2

who is told you need more signatures  otherwise, you

3

could imagine scenarios  I think one of the amicus

4

briefs spins out one where, say, the person comes in and

5

the bank says, I need  because you're of a certain

6

religion or a certain race, I need 15 guarantors for

7

your  well, all 15 guarantors can simply say no, but

8

under their view, all 15 guarantors actually have a

9

claim under the ECOA.  And that just makes no sense.

10

That's far beyond what Congress 

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's not  that's not

12

quite accurate, because the only person who's given a

13

right not to be discriminated against is the

14

applicant  an applicant on the basis of marital

15

status.

16

            MR. McALLISTER:  No, Your Honor.  No, that's

17

not true.  I mean, the statute covers  covers marital

18

status, sex, religion, race, age even.  So there are a

19

number of prohibited bases.  The original statute was

20

sex and marital status, but then in 1976, it was

21

expanded to cover other 

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Mr. McAllister, why  why

23

does it matter?  A person sitting at the table says,

24

please lend me $10,000.  Now, the  the lender says, I

25

want you to have someone from a forbidden category as a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

guarantor.  So he's outside, he walks in and he says,

2

I'll guaranty this loan.  I want you to lend him $10,000

3

and I'll guaranty it.

4

            Well, why hasn't that guarantor applied for

5

a loan to another person?

6

            MR. McALLISTER:  It is  it 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What is it  because who

8

are the ones you said do fall within applicants?  It's

9

not just 

10

            MR. McALLISTER:  So it's 

11

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It's the person sitting at

12

the table, then others come up, and they have to get 

13

there's like sureties, they're like guarantors, there

14

are a bunch of different things.

15

            MR. McALLISTER:  None of them 

16

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It seemed to me some of

17

them you thought might.

18

            MR. McALLISTER:  None of them actually

19

should be included.  And if I suggested that  ours is

20

a straightforward definition adhering to the statute.

21

You can certainly have joint applicants, joint

22

borrowers, but that means they are receiving the benefit

23

of the credit directly.  Credit is flowing to them.

24

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why?  I mean, the thing I

25

don't get is why can't you apply?  An applicant means a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

person who applies for something.  So why can't you

2

apply for the thing being, give some money to this other

3

person?

4

            MR. McALLISTER:  Because, again, I come back

5

to the statutory definition, Justice Breyer, which says

6

you are applying for credit.  And the statute defines

7

credit.  So it says credit is the right to defer payment

8

of a debt.

9

            And the person who has asked for 

10

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  And you say, I am

11

applying for just that.  And I am applying for just

12

that.  My application, here it is, in writing, is that I

13

want you to do just that for Smith, who's sitting at the

14

table.

15

            MR. McALLISTER:  And in our view, the

16

statute means Smith is the applicant.

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Because?

18

            MR. McALLISTER:  Because, again, the  the

19



20

            JUSTICE BREYER:  The person who filled  I

21

don't want you to repeat yourself.  You don't have to.

22

            MR. McALLISTER:  Okay.

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But I mean, you see where

24

I'm having the problem, that Jones, who came in, he

25

fills out the papers and he signs the signature, he puts

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

in all the things and he says, please, please, please

2

give that credit to Smith.

3

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, again, I don't think

4

that 

5

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why hasn't  he's applied.

6

He's applied for the credit to go to Smith.  I mean, in

7

English, hasn't he?  Why not?

8

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I  I think that's

9

in a sense contrary, really, to the  the most ordinary

10

understandings of the word "applicant."  Of course,

11

we've got a statutory definition.

12

            If I go back to the university admissions

13

process 

14

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  The  the

15

definition, the common definition, the Chief has defined

16

it that way, but the only dictionary that uses it in the

17

way you want is Webster's Third.  Every other

18

dictionary  and Webster's Third has been criticized by

19

at least one of my colleagues, if not more.  All right?

20

            MR. McALLISTER:  I'm aware of that.

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a terrible dictionary.

22

            (Laughter.)

23

            MR. McALLISTER:  I'm aware of that.

24

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  All the others don't use

25

a direct benefit language.  They all say you're just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

asking for an extension of credit.  And they don't

2

suggest it has to be for yourself, it could be  you're

3

asking for an extension of credit for anyone.

4

            So I  I mean, I'm  I'm quarreling with

5

the  with your reliance on some common understanding

6

of a word.

7

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I come back 

8

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You've got cosigners,

9

you've got parents who  who sign as cosigners rental

10

agreements for their kids.  They're not getting the

11

benefit of the apartment.  Nobody believes that they are

12

using the apartment.  They're doing it to bolster up the

13

credit of their child.

14

            So I don't know why applicant can't mean, in

15

common parlance, that you're asking for credit to be

16

extended to anyone, whether it's you or  or another

17

person.

18

            MR. McALLISTER:  Perhaps that's the key,

19

Justice Sotomayor, is that you're talking common

20

parlance.  In my view, common parlance is the definition

21

that  that we assert and that the statute asserts.

22

Judge 

23

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Then why did  why did

24

the Federal Reserve Board initially  specifically

25

exclude guarantors?  If it was so clear that applicant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

excludes guarantors, why did the Federal Reserve Board

2

do something so unnecessary to specifically exclude

3

them?

4

            MR. McALLISTER:  Because I think they

5

created confusion, Justice Ginsburg.  So I agree with my

6

colleague, Mr. Fletcher, that there was a reg for a

7

short period of time that suggested in one particular

8

setting, multiple applicants, who do you give notice to?

9

            The Fed put in a  some language that said,

10

well, don't give to  notice to applicants such as

11

secondary obligors, such as guarantors.

12

            The Fed then, a couple minutes later,

13

proposed maybe we should just make this a general rule

14

that guarantors are included.  They took in notice and

15

comment, and a few months later they said, oh, we've

16

really sort of stirred up the pot here.  Let's just make

17

clear that guarantors and secondary obligors are not

18

included.  And that's why we got the 1976 version.

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr.  Mr. McAllister, in

20

Corbin on Contracts, when they talk about guaranties,

21

they say, in most cases of guaranty contracts, the offer

22

comes from the guarantor requesting the giving of credit

23

to a principal debtor.

24

            So Corbin on Contracts is  clearly thinks

25

that the guarantor is a requestor, is an applicant for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

credit, and just to a thirdparty, to the principal

2

debtor.

3

            But why  why  I mean, that's a pretty,

4

you know, creditspecific definition of what it means to

5

apply for credit.  And including, pretty clearly,

6

guarantors.

7

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, that's  that 

8

that is a  what Corbin says.  But again, I would come

9

back to guarantors do not sign the same document as the

10

borrower.  They are not liable in the same way.  They

11

have a separate contract with the lender, which the

12

borrower is not even party to the guarantor's contract.

13

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, do you think that it's

14

really contingent on that, on exactly which contract you

15

signed?  I mean, these folks give you a lot of

16

information, they sign their names to a lot of

17

information, and  I mean, unlike the usual guarantor

18

case where the guarantor is only liable if there's a

19

default, here the guarantor is jointly and severally

20

liable, much like a cosigner is.

21

            Or at any rate, cosigners are jointly and

22

severally 

23

            MR. McALLISTER:  That's  cosigners are

24

jointly and severally liable.

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you want to put them in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

the same box, too.  So it doesn't really matter 

2

            MR. McALLISTER:  Right.  But that is a

3

mischaracterization.  These are guaranties 

4

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  It doesn't matter.

5

            MR. McALLISTER:   that are not joint and

6

severally liable.

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I bet we could find 50 like

8

that.  This is the collegiate dictionary.  Maybe that

9

makes it too simpleminded.

10

            (Laughter.)

11

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But the  the  it says,

12

an applicant  this is very helpful  an applicant is

13

a person who applies for something, all right?  We're

14

not making too much progress.

15

            But then when we go to apply, the second

16

definition down here, is to make an appeal or request.

17

Does the guarantor make an appeal or request?  Yes.

18

Especially in the form of written application.  Even

19

writes it, e.g., for a job.  No, doesn't apply for a

20

job, doesn't have to be a job.

21

            Do you see, it's a general kind of thing,

22

and we're at step one of Chevron, and we're only talking

23

about what 

24

            MR. McALLISTER:  And we're talking 

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:   the meaning.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume that that

2

definition would  would cover my letter to somebody

3

urging that person to hire somebody else.

4

            MR. McALLISTER:  I think that's

5

exactly right.  Yep.

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I would be  I would be an

7

applicant under  under that definition, which is, of

8

course, absurd.

9

            MR. McALLISTER:  And two  two things about

10

that absurdity, Justice Scalia.  One absurdity is this

11



12

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, he's not asking

13

for money.

14

            MR. McALLISTER:  Pardon?

15

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  He's recommending

16

someone, but this is about an extension of credit.

17

            MR. McALLISTER:  Right.  But still, you'd be

18

asking for the same result that the applicant is

19

seeking.  So I mean, I take the question in that

20

fashion.

21

            But, two  two things about that 

22

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, it would be a

23

different thing if the statute said, don't discriminate

24

on the basis of someone being a Justice.  That  that's

25

what you 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

            MR. McALLISTER:  It should say that, but 

2

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The analogy would work

3

only if you did that, right?

4

            MR. McALLISTER:  But  but what I was going

5

to say is the government concedes that the statute uses

6

 well, in fact, they didn't say this, but I believe

7

the statute uses the word "applicant" something like 50

8

times, and only for one purpose do they say this

9

definition should apply.  That runs counter to

10

presumptions this Court has long stated.  The statute is

11

used repeatedly 

12

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought that the

13

government answered that question differently.  I  I

14

thought their position was that if they prevail, their

15

definition of the word "applicant" to include guarantor

16

apply  A, applies across the board 50 times, and B,

17

makes the Act perfectly workable.

18

            Did  did 

19

            MR. McALLISTER:  Neither one is  I don't

20

think either one is true 

21

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You may disagree 

22

            MR. McALLISTER:   Justice Kennedy.

23

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Maybe I misunderstood

24

their answer.

25

            MR. McALLISTER:  Oh, I don't think they say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

that it would apply across all 50 uses.  They said we

2

could change it  and actually, they're suggesting they

3

could have 49 other definitions of applicant.  Every

4

time it's used somewhere else in the statute, they could

5

define it differently for that purpose.

6

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And can you give me an

7

example of where it would be really contrary to a

8

sensible interpretation of the Act to use the term

9

"guarantor" and 

10

            MR. McALLISTER:  For example 

11

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:   "applicant" as

12

synonymous, other than for what we're talking about

13

here?

14

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, for example, giving

15

notice of adverse action.  I mean, the Agency itself has

16

said a guarantor cannot be subject to adverse action,

17

and yet you would have 

18

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I frankly  I frankly

19

don't believe why that makes the statute unworkable.  If

20

I'm a guarantor of someone's debt, I want to know when

21

they're in default because I'm going to call them up and

22

start  if it's my child, I'm going to start

23

browbeating them, meaning  I don't know what the

24

rationale for that was, whether I agree with it or not.

25

But why does it make it unworkable?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, it would  it is not

2

just that, Justice Sotomayor.  It's not just at some

3

point down the road.  Usually, this is focused on the

4

application itself.  So again, if you have the case of

5

multiple guarantors, the bank turns down the borrower,

6

then they're under obligation, if you take that view of

7

the statute, to notify everyone who had any connection

8

to the transaction.  But the Agency has long said that

9

is not required.  The Agency's commenter  if you look

10

at  if you look at supplement one, the interpretations

11

of the regs and other commentary by the agencies, except

12

for this purpose, the Agency always talks about

13

guarantors as different than joint applicants,

14

coborrowers.  No one in the industry would think of

15

these two things as the same.

16

            To come back to the Chief  Mr. Chief

17

Justice's point, a bank would not say a borrower is

18

equivalent to a guarantor.  Not even close.  They're two

19

very different things.

20

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  They certainly wouldn't

21

say a borrower is equivalent to a guarantor.  But the

22

question is whether an applicant is equivalent to 

23

            MR. McALLISTER:  They would say the person

24

who wants the credit, the applicant, is not the same as

25

a guarantor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So what  what 

2

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  The entire idea of a

3

guaranty contract, right, why is a guaranty agreement

4

even enforceable?  Is it there is consideration, and the

5

consideration has to do with the fact that credit is

6

going to a thirdparty, right?  And so the guarantor is

7

stepping in and saying, I'm asking for something and I'm

8

getting something when I enter into this contract, and

9

that's the credit will go not to me, but to a third

10

party.

11

            So the question I think is, like, why should

12

that be, you know  just because it's to a third party,

13

the appeal, the request to the application is as to a

14

third party rather than to yourself, why that should

15

make any difference if the question is just what does

16

applicant mean?  Applicant doesn't have to be for

17

yourself.

18

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I  I agree that's

19

the consideration for the guaranty.  But what that opens

20

the door to, Your Honor, is there have been 60 or 70

21

reported ECOA decisions since the change in 1985.  More

22

than half of those are within the last five years.

23

After the 2008 crash, massive defaults, this is coming

24

up more and more for banks as a defense.

25

            And if I can just have one minute, I'll tell

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

you where this leads for banks.  So if the rule is a

2

spousal guaranty can be voided  and that's what  the

3

relief sought.  They're not asking for damages.  They

4

want to invalidate, void the entire guaranty.  That was

5

Judge Posner's point.  So if that is the rule, what is a

6

bank to do when a married person comes in and seeks

7

credit?

8

            Well, one thing the bank may do is say only

9

secured credit because I cannot rely on any guaranty.  I

10

can't even rely on a spousal guaranty if the spouse says

11

I want to give the guaranty, because when this goes in a

12

bad direction and it's time to collect, then years

13

later, that spouse may do what these spouses have done

14

and say I was required to do this, this was a violation

15

of the statute.  And at a minimum, the lender is then

16

engaged, as this lender has been, in extensive

17

litigation costs just to even try to resolve the

18

situation.

19

            All of that leads to lenders are going to be

20

less likely to want to  to lend to married couples

21

except if they are secure in their loans.  And that may

22

mean you have to put up assets, a guaranty no longer

23

suffices, and it may mean you have to get more

24

guarantors because they can't rely on the spouse.  None

25

of that furthers the purpose of the ECOA, which was to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

get the credit in the hands of people who were at that

2

time being discriminated against.

3

            So the fundamental problem with Reg B is it

4

opens the door.  And now that the lawyers have

5

discovered this provision and are bringing it up

6

regularly, it will have a dramatic impact on the credit

7

industry.

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  On the  on the question

9

of the guarantor entering a contract just as the

10

borrower enters a contract, the two contracts are quite

11

different.  The borrower enters a bilateral contract, I

12

promise to pay back the money if you  with interest if

13

you promise to lend me the money.  The guarantor

14

is  is asking for a unilateral contract.  The

15

guarantor is just saying, I make no promises, but if you

16

lend money to this person that I'm guarantying and that

17

person defaults, I'll make good.  That's  that's a

18

unilateral contract, which doesn't bind the  the

19

lender at all.  It's if the lender chooses to do that,

20

I'll stand good for the  for the default.

21

            The two contracts are quite different.  And

22

in that respect, you can't call both  both of them

23

applicants just because they both  they both have

24

contracts.  Of course they both have contracts.

25

            MR. McALLISTER:  I agree with that,

Justice Scalia.

2

            And unless the Court has further questions,

3

I would ask that you affirm the decision of the Eighth

4

Circuit.

5

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.

6

            Mr. Duggan, you have four minutes.

           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN M. DUGGAN

8

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

            MR. DUGGAN:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10

and may it please the Court:

11

            I think the primary answer to talk about, to

12

start with, is these guaranties are not simply

13

guaranties of the performance of the borrower.  They are

14

separate, independent performance required by the

15

guarantor under the guaranty.  The guarantor must pay

16

its creditors on time.  The guarantor must provide

17

financial statements to the lender.  The guarantor must

18

fulfill all other obligations and any other agreement

19

that the guarantor has with the lender.  If the

20

guarantor fails to perform any one of those single,

21

independent requirements of performance under the

22

guaranty, the guarantor agrees to repay the debt in

23

full.  There is separate performance under the guaranty.

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Could you ask  could you

25

respond to counsel's last point?  Why would a bank ever

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

decide to give a loan with a spousal guaranty?

2

            MR. DUGGAN:  I'm not sure I 

3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Why would  why would a

4

bank do that?

5

            MR. DUGGAN:  There's several circumstances.

6

Number one, husbands and wives can come under the

7

regulation safe harbors as joint applicants

8

contemporaneously and say we want joint credit.  It's

9

only a violation of the Act if the lender, once an

10

independent spouse comes forward and says I want credit,

11

says as a condition to me extending you the credit you

12

want, you must bring your spouse along.

13

            The second thing is I think this regulation

14

has got to be the easiest regulation to comply with.  A,

15

B, C, 1, 2, 3.  There's safe harbors under the

16

regulation.  If a lender is relying upon jointly owned

17

assets of a husband and wife, the regulation and the

18

statute, 1691(d), create a specific safe harbor that

19

says get a security interest in the asset and don't get

20

a guaranty, or simply ask the spouse to waive her

21

marital interest in the jointlyowned property so that

22

if in fact you have to execute on that jointlyowned

23

property to collect the debt, you're permitted to do

24

that.  Two very simple safe harbors to comply with.

25

            What they don't want you to do is to strap

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the spouse with the potential adverse credit in the

2

future where she has to use her income or her earnings

3

or her ability to get future credit to pay off either a

4

divorced or deceased spouse.  One of the rationales.

5

Makes a ton of sense.

6

            Back to the other points that were made.

7

The application here, the dictionary definitions run the

8

gamut, but they all have two specific statements.

9

Appeal or request.  And the statute here says they

10

repeal  applies for an extension renewal of credit.

11

Doesn't say of credit to the borrower.  Doesn't say of a

12

loan to the borrower.  It says of credit generically.

13

            And back to Justice Breyer's comments, in

14

fact, why in the world that somebody who becomes

15

contractually, jointly and severally liable to repay the

16

debt in full and says, I have my independent obligations

17

under my guaranty, and if I don't perform, you can

18

collect the entire debt from me, how is that person in

19

that context not saying to the lender, I am appealing to

20

you and requesting an extension of credit?  I'll go so

21

far as to say I'll stand behind the loan, and I have my

22

independent obligations to perform under the guaranty.

23

And if I don't perform, I'll pay.  That, to me, can be

24

nothing but an applicant.

25

            Thank you so much for your time.  I'm happy
