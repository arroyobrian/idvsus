ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


9
10

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


11

In 1974, when it enacted the Family Educational


12

Rights and Privacy Act, Congress conditioned Federal


13

funding for educational institutions on the institution


14

not having a policy or practice of releasing student


15

records without consent.

16

condition in terms of individual rights.

17

example, follow the model of title IX, enacted 2 years


18

earlier and also dealing with educational institutions,


19

and say something like, no student at a school receiving


20

Federal funds shall have his records released without his


21

consent.

22

said that no funds shall be made available to any


23

institution having a policy or practice of releasing


24

student records without consent.


25

Congress did not phrase this

It did not, for


Instead, Congress proceeded more indirectly.

The statute is directed to the Secretary of

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It


1

Education.

2

available, not to the institution receiving the funds, and


3

certainly not to the individual student.

4

cases establish that that is a distinction that makes a


5

difference.

6

would be far less reason --


7

He's the one who makes Federal funds


This Court's


In Cannon, for example, the Court said there


QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, isn't it primarily a


8

distinction that makes a difference in connection with


9

whether there's an implied cause of action, rather than


10
11

whether 1983 authorized a cause of action?

MR. ROBERTS:

In the implied right of action


12

question there are two questions, did Congress intend to


13

create a right, and did Congress intend to provide a


14

judicial remedy?

15

questions, did Congress intend to create a right, and did


16

Congress intend to preclude resort to the 1983 remedy, so


17

that first question I think is the same under both


18

categories of cases, and as the Court said in Cannon, if


19

Congress phrases the statute as -- quote, as a prohibition


20

on the disbursement of public funds, there's far less


21

reason to think that they intended a private remedy.


22

In addition, purpose speaks in terms of an


In the 1983 context, there are two


23

institutional policy or practice, not individual instances


24

of disclosures.

25

creating provision like title IX is stark.

Again, the contrast with a rights-

Title IX says,


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

no student shall be subject to discrimination, but FERPA


2

doesn't look at what happens to individual students.

3

looks at institutional behavior, institutional policy or


4

practice.


5

QUESTION:

It


The statute does talk about rights of


6

students and rights of parents.

7

say, preceded by the mandate that there shall be no


8

policy, but in this regard it seems to me to be at least


9

more specific than -- with references to rights than some


10
11

It's, of course, as you


of the other funding statutes we've looked at.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, of course, the word rights


12

does not appear in the disclosure provision, subsection


13

(b), and in Pennhurst, where the Court was dealing with


14

developmentally disabled bill of rights, the Court


15

explained that just because the statute uses the word


16

rights doesn't mean that it creates a 1983 right.


17

QUESTION:

Yes, I recognize in the one section


18

that we're talking about here you have a stronger argument


19

than the other, but if we assume for the moment would have


20

a 1983 cause of action under the whole act without going


21

down provision by provision, then I do think you have to


22

recognize that the act does talk about rights of students,


23

rights of parents to look at files, et cetera.


24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, first of all, the Court in


Blessing said that you don't look at the whole act.
5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

You


1

have to look at the particular provision that is relied


2

upon to create the 1983 right.


3

Second of all, we're 6 years before Maine v.


4

Thiboutot when Congress passed this, so it's not as if


5

they're using rights as some term of art under the


6

established jurisprudence, and finally, I think Congress


7

can use the term to refer to the opportunity of parents


8

and students to participate in the administrative remedy,


9

to the criteria that the Secretary of Education is to use


10

in deciding whether to terminate funds, without thereby


11

necessarily triggering coverage under section 1982.


12

QUESTION:

Well, I think it's that latter


13

rationale that might be stronger for your case.

14

somewhat reluctant to parse through this statute and say


15

there's no right under (b), there is a right under (e), et


16

cetera.


17

MR. ROBERTS:

I'll be


Well, whatever rights, whether


18

you're talking -- putting aside the question whether it's


19

a 1983 right or a right to participate in the process


20

that's established under the statute, it is part of the


21

policy or practice that the Secretary of Education is to


22

look to in deciding whether to disburse funds.

23

obligation is to the Secretary, not to the institution,


24

and that is made clear when you look at what Congress said


25

about enforcement.


The


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The Congress said, the Secretary shall enforce


2

FERPA, and the Secretary shall deal with violations.

Now,


3

that deal-with-violations language should strike the Court


4

as unusual and, in fact, nowhere else in the United States


5

Code does Congress tell an agency to deal with violations. 


6

It has almost a colloquial tone to it.

7

FERPA is your problem, you deal with the violations. 


8

There's no suggestion that they would be dealt with by


9

private actions brought in court and, in fact, that


Mr. Secretary,


10

conclusion is reinforced when you look at subsection (g),


11

which tells the Secretary, you set up an office to deal --


12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ROBERTS:

14

Whereabouts is this, Mr. Roberts?

12a of our statutory appendix,


Your Honor.


15

QUESTION:

Thank you.


16

MR. ROBERTS:

It says to the Secretary, you set


17

up an office to investigate, process, review, and


18

adjudicate complaints about violations under FERPA.

19

think this is something --


20

QUESTION:

I


You say violations of this section. 


21

You tell us that there's no violation of this section


22

unless there's a policy, right?


23

MR. ROBERTS:

24
25

There's no violation unless


there's a policy.

QUESTION:

So he doesn't have to investigate any

7

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

individual complaint, unless the person comes in and says,


2

not only do they do it to me, but this is their policy,


3

right?


4

MR. ROBERTS:

It's evidence that there might be


5

a problem with the school's policy, and this is what makes


6

it different, for example, from the Wright case.

7

Wright, the Court said, look, all

8

funding.

9

attention of the Secretary.

In


you can do is terminate


There's no process to bring complaints to the

That's not enough.


10

Here, Congress said to the Secretary, you set up


11

a complaint procedure, and if someone's got a problem with


12

the release of their records you investigate it, you


13

process the complaint, you review it, and you adjudicate


14

it, and what has happened is that complaints have come in,


15

and the Family Policy Compliance Office have gotten


16

responses from the university, and voluntary compliance


17

has ensured that the policy and practice of the


18

institution complies with the Secretary's view.


19

QUESTION:

I guess that that's all that the


20

plaintiff could accomplish in court anyway.

21

plaintiffs here don't contend that they would be entitled


22

to recovery if there is no policy or practice.


23

MR. ROBERTS:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct.

The


That's correct.


So the Secretary's enforcement


authority is coextensive with what the court did.

MR. ROBERTS:

In terms of the scope of


liability --

QUESTION:

You'd need an allegation of a policy


or practice.

MR. ROBERTS:

Exactly, but it is the fact that


6

Congress focused on the policy or practice that helps


7

establish that they were not concerned with individual


8

instances of disclosure.

9

distinctly individual right being protected when whether


10

it's protected or not depends on whether the school does


11

the same thing to others.

12

concern, not an individual concern, and it's the --


It is odd to speak of a


That looks more like a systemic


13

QUESTION:

14

mutually exclusive?

15

I think your argument would be more impressive if this


16

were a large operation.

17

courts, that the institutions will be harassed by all


18

these lawsuits across the country, and yet this one agency


19

that you are saying will take care of it, this centralized


20

administration, we're told that as of 2000 it had all of


21

seven staff members in that entire office, hardly a number


22

that is likely to be able to handle a lot of complaints.


23

Well, Mr. Roberts, why are they

The Secretary has this authority, and


MR. ROBERTS:

On the one hand you say, the


It's very important to keep in


24

mind the distinction between how matters are handled


25

before the Family Policy Compliance Office and in court.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

FERPA places a premium on voluntary compliance, on


2

informal and inexpensive adjudication.

3

action in Federal court doesn't.

4

Secretary shall deal with violations, not the court.

5

Secretary says -- and the statute goes on to say, we're


6

going to tell you how to deal with individual


7

complainants.

8

the office that's set up by the Secretary, and there they


9

will find an informal, inexpensive procedure in which


A 1983 damages


The statute says the


They don't go to court, either.

The


They go to


10

people can quickly find out what the school's answer is


11

and, in a case in which it suggests that there's a policy


12

or practice problem, secure voluntary problem.


13

QUESTION:

Do we know from the -- maybe the


14

Solicitor General can tell us -- if the seven people are


15

overworked?


16

MR. ROBERTS:

In fact, in practice most of what


17

they do is field questions from the school, how do we


18

handle this situation, what do we do about this?


19

QUESTION:

But how do you get a stop order?

One


20

of the points that were made is that if records are about


21

to be divulged to, say, a newspaper, and the student or


22

the parent wants an immediate stop order, you can go into


23

court and get a TRO.

24

Secretary's arsenal that has that kind of muscle behind


25

it, is there?


There's nothing comparable in the


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBERTS:

There certainly is.

The first


2

thing, if you're a student subjected to that, what you


3

would do is call the Family Policy Compliance Office and


4

the Secretary, keep in mind, has the cudgel of terminating


5

funding behind the most informal telephone call or


6

correspondence.

7

Education tells them to do with respect to FERPA, because


8

they appreciate the sanctions that can be brought.

9

the way the system has worked effectively since FERPA was


10
11

Schools respond to what the Secretary of


That's


enacted.

QUESTION:

This office can't really give relief


12

to any individual, however, right, except to tell the


13

school not to release, wrongfully release records in the


14

future, right?


15

MR. ROBERTS:

The focus of the office is in


16

vindicating what the statute provides.

The statute is


17

directed to institutional behavior.

18

complaints in order to secure compliance with the proper


19

policy or practice.


20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ROBERTS:

22

QUESTION:

The office reviews


So all --

It is -- it is --


All you have to do is eliminate the


23

policy, and everything that's happened in the past is


24

water over the dam --


25

MR. ROBERTS:

Because --

11

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

-- and go and sin no more is what the


2

Secretary says, right?


3

MR. ROBERTS:

Because the statute is directed to


4

prospective compliance, not retrospective compensation for


5

injuries.

6

The 1983 --


7

That is a different focus than section 1983. 


QUESTION:

What do you do about the language


8

where it says, no funds shall be made available to a


9

school that effectively prevent, et cetera, the student --


10

it says, of the right to inspect.

11

inspect right in the first sentence, and then later on it


12

says in (b) no -- or later on it says that you have to


13

tell the parent in (e) of the rights accorded them by


14

this.

15

get -- that others have asked, but I want to have very


16

clear in my mind the specific answer.

17

give you any money if you interfere with the right.


18

It says of the right to


I mean, that's the same question, but I want to


It says, we won't


Now, that sounds as if there's a right, and then


19

they underline it by saying, and you have to tell them


20

about the right, and what's -- your direct response to


21

that is what?


22

MR. ROBERTS:

The direct response is that -- you


23

left out words in the quote, which is that no funds shall


24

be made available to an institution that has a policy or


25

practice, and the question is, is Congress focusing on

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

protecting individual rights in, as the Court said in


2

Blessing, an individual way, or are they addressing a


3

systemic concern.

4

Secretary -- this statute is directed to the Secretary. 


5

Don't make funds available, and it says, look at the


6

policy or practice.

7

which would suggest the conferring of an individual right.


8
9

The policy, or the focus on the


It's not written the way title IX is,


Secondly, you're quoting from subsection (a). 

Subsection (b) does not talk about rights.


10

And finally, the answer --


11

QUESTION:

Well, but Mr. Roberts, let me just be


12

sure I understand your answer.

13

Justice Breyer does, because in 1232g(1)(B) on page 2a, 


14

no funds and so forth shall be made available if the


15

agency has a policy of denying or effectively prevents the


16

parents of students the right to inspect.

17

right to inspect a Federal right?


18

MR. ROBERTS:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ROBERTS:

I have the same problem


Now, is the


I think not, because --


What is its source?

The right to inspect is not an


21

independent and freestanding right.

It is a description


22

of the sort of policy or practice that should prompt the


23

Secretary of Education to withhold funds.

24

this is not the provision that's at issue in this case. 


25

Subsection (b) --


In addition,

1

QUESTION:

Well, I understand, but your initial


2

submission is that this is not a rights-creating statute,


3

it just -- but I don't know where the right comes from


4

that they refer to in that section and also in -- on 12a


5

informing parents and students of rights under this


6

section.


7

MR. ROBERTS:

Under this section.

I think


8

Congress can use the term, rights, to refer to the


9

opportunities that are provided to the parents and


10

students and to the criteria that the Secretary of


11

Education will look to in deciding funding, without


12

thereby triggering coverage under section 1983.


13
14
15

Just like in Pennhurst, Congress used the word

rights repeatedly in --

QUESTION:

But do you think that they would have


16

had the rights described herein even if this statute had


17

not been passed?


18

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

There would not have been --


19

no rights are conferred under this statute.

What is


20

conferred is discretion on the Secretary of Education to


21

withhold funds depending upon a policy or practice.

22

describing the policy or practice that should trigger


23

action by the Secretary of Education, the statute refers


24

to opportunities that must be provided to parents and


25

students by that institution, but in doing so I don't

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

In

think Congress is necessarily triggering the right to a


2

damages action.


3
4

QUESTION:

You use the word opportunity in the


statute wherever the statute used the word rights.


5

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the statute doesn't use the


6

words right under subsection (b).

7

Pennhurst was called the Bill of Rights, and this Court


8

concluded that that did not confer rights.

9

is whether Congress acted in a way that indicated an

intent to confer an individually enforceable right.

MR. ROBERTS:

What section is the one at issue?

1232g(b) is the section at issue. 


16

Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer were quoting from

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

If I could begin by responding to Justice


11

Kennedy's question about whether the Family Policy


12

Compliance Office is overworked, I will tell you that they


13

do work very hard, but they handle -- for a small staff,


14

they handle an amazing amount of work, and have been doing


15

so for 28 years under this statute.

16

pieces of correspondence a year, up to -- close to 100 of


17

things that are formally categorized as complaints as they


18

go through the investigation stages.

QUESTION:

That's 10 phone calls a day.


3

(Laughter.)


4

MS. MILLETT:

That's right, and well over 1,000


5

e-mails, and I think one of the reasons that there


6

isn't -- I mean, if you look at the legal landscape out


7

there, too, there hasn't been an enormous volume of 1983


8

actions, and that is because the Secretary has been very


9

successful, I think, in communicating and enforcing this


10

in an informal manner with the universities.

11

universities wish to comply with this, and a lot of it


12

is -- we've had 28 years now to explicate what this


13

statute means and to clarify what it means.

The


Now, I fear that may change if this Court were


15

to recognize a 1983 action --


16

QUESTION:

What is your opinion about the idea


17

that this could be bifurcated, that it orders a right to


18

inspect, that isn't going to be too tough, you let the


19

person look at the record, but there's a policy of


20

disclosure.

21

to say there's a private right under (a) but not under


22

(b)?

Does that make sense in terms of the statute


What's your opinion of that?


23

MS. MILLETT:

Okay, I'll answer that in two


24

stages.

It makes sense to bifurcate analysis as a matter


25

of this Court's 1983 precedents, and specifically that's

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

exactly what the Court did in the Blessing case, which is


2

your most recent case up here.


3

As a whole, we don't think it actually makes


4

sense to do so under this statute.

The Court may not


5

decide that today because the only provision at issue is


6

subsection (b), which does not refer to rights and focuses


7

on policies or practices, but our position is that there


8

are three mutually reinforcing features here, both in (a)


9

and (b), that show there is not a right under 1983, and


10

that is -- even under (a), the very beginning of the


11

sentence, and the operative command is that no funds shall


12

be distributed, or shall be distributed by the Secretary


13

of Education, and that is distinctive, unique language


14

that this Court recognized, suggested in Cannon, and held


15

just last term in Sandoval.

16

Congress would use to create individual rights and in


17

particular, in 1974, 2 years after title IX was enacted,


18

Congress chose different, distinctly different language


19

that is very uncommon in the U.S. Code.


20

QUESTION:

It's not the type of language


If you go through the first three


21

factors listed in Blessing, Congress intended to benefit


22

the plaintiff, and it not be beyond judicial competence --

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

25

Not not be --


-- and there must be an unambiguously


binding obligation on the State, it would seem to me that

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those are met here, and that you then have to go to the


2

next part of the test which is -- that creates a


3

presumption that there is a right.


4

MS. MILLETT:

Well, as we said in our brief, we


5

think that the problem here is not that it's vague or


6

amorphous, and it's not that there's not binding


7

obligations, which is the second two prongs of the


8

Blessing test, but the first prong of the Blessing test,


9

while phrased in terms of benefiting individuals, the


10

Court made clear in Blessing it's not just a general


11

inquiry if it's of some good to people, because all


12

legislation is of some good to somebody.

13

creates individual entitlements, and that's where we think


14

this statute fails, a statute that --


15

QUESTION:

It is whether it


Well, with reference to the other


16

parts, the non-(b) parts of the statute, it does seem to


17

me that it talks about the student and the parent in very


18

specific terms, and it uses the term, rights.


19

MS. MILLETT:

Well, again, this Court made clear


20

in Pennhurst that you can't just look at the word right in


21

isolation.

22

some important contexts I would like to stress, again even


23

up through subsection (a).

2

education records of the children -- I'm sorry, I'm


3

reading from -- this is my appendix. I hate to confuse the


4

Court, to my brief, at 1a, where subsection (a) is, and


5

there has to be a policy of denying or effectively


6

preventing the parents of students, plural, access to


7

these records, so we think that makes clear that you have


8

the same programmatic, system-wide rule here, and in fact


9

the Secretary's position is that if you had one instance


10

of a failure to allow someone access to records during


11

nonpolicy or nonprogram-wide failure to allow access to


12

records, that would not violate FERPA.

13

still -- it's written differently.

18

question I asked Mr. Roberts, I suppose, but the first

access, denying the right to inspect and review education

QUESTION:

it's the first sentence of 1232g on


2

page 2a of the blue brief, and the first, very first


3

sentence in the statute ends by saying the right to

inspect and review the education records of their


5

children, and my question is whether you think that is a


6

federally created right and, if not, what is the source of


7

that right?


8

MS. MILLETT:
answers.

I think it's not -- I have two


First of all, whatever it is, it's a collective,


10

program-wide, aggregated right, because it speaks in the


11

plural, but secondly it;'s not -- I think it is used as


12

Mr. Roberts said here in a shorthand way, and the


13

legislative history says that one of the things they were


14

trying to enforce here is what Congress considered to be


15

pre-existing moral or legal --


16

QUESTION:

Let me be sure you have my question


17

in mind.

18

refers is a federally created right, or right with a


19

different source?


20

Do you think the right to which the statute


MS. MILLETT:

I think what the statute is


21

creating there is a Federal overlay to protect pre -- as


22

was said in the legislative history on page 17 of our


23

brief, preexisting legal or moral right.


24
25

QUESTION:

So that if a school came back and


said, in our State there's no such right, then the statute

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would not apply?


2

MS. MILLETT:

Congress felt that when it said


3

preexisting moral or legal rights, there was a sense of


4

Congress that this is a type of, not in a bright sense


5

that we use for purposes of 1983 actions, but the


6

legislative history was that Congress had a sense here


7

that this was something all individuals should have.

8

this --


9

QUESTION:

But


It is something they should have by


10

reason of this statute, and therefore it's created, or by


11

some preexisting rule of law in some -- at some other


12

source?


13

MS. MILLETT:

Well, Congress' language was


14

preexisting moral or legal rights, and so I'm not sure


15

what one considers --


16

QUESTION:

If it's another source, it seems to


17

me that the State or the institution could say, in this


18

locality there is no such right, and that would make the


19

statute totally inapplicable.


20

MS. MILLETT:

No, it wouldn't, because what you


21

still have is, once you take these funds you have a


22

Federal overlay.

23

prior law doesn't matter, which you have --


24
25

there's no doubt that there's a Federal level of

protection here for privacy, and it's at an aggregated,

collective system-wide level.

Stevens' line of questions and concluded that there is a

position -- would that be fatal to your position, or would


12

you say it's a right that can be enforced through a


13

comprehensive administrative scheme?


14

MS. MILLETT:

In two ways it wouldn't.

It's not


15

at issue in this case, and the second argument is that the


16

nature of the

17

that's created here, Congress has created the very type of


18

scheme that it thinks is appropriate to enforce these


19

collective, aggregated, system-wide rights that it created


20

here, that in fact --


21

-- whatever the nature of the right is


QUESTION:

Well, are you in effect saying, as


22

Mr. Roberts did, I think when he used the word,


23

opportunity, that this is kind of, that the scheme of this


24

section is sort of an if-then sort of scheme.

25

them the opportunity then -- and you do so on a systemic

certain action.

same thing that he did.


Is that -- you are saying essentially the


4

MS. MILLETT:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.


So when you say there's a Federal

right, you really mean there's an opportunity.

7

opportunity is denied, then certain administrative action


8

can be taken.


9

MS. MILLETT:

That's right.

If the


There's a Federal

obligation -- to use Mr. Roberts' words, a Federal

obligation, once you take these funds, to not have system-


12

wide practices or policies that either deny access or, in


13

this case, disclose without consent, or an authorized


14

basis for disclosure, and I think it's very -- again, very


15

unique language.

16

the two separately, but when you combined the no-funds

language and the focus on system-wide policies and

practices, that this Court made clear in Blessing that

type of aggregate language doesn't create individual


20

lights -- rights, excuse me, and then you marry to that

the fact that Congress has enacted an administrative

QUESTION:

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN


3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


4
5

Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.


MS. BRINKMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


6

In FERPA, Congress gave parents the right to


7

prevent the release of certain educational records. 


8

That's evident from Congress' choice of words and the


9

structure and history of the statute.

There are at least


10

five indications of that intent, including references to


11

rights under that provision, which I'll get to in a


12

moment.

It involves reading two sections together.


13

First, in section -- this is on page 9a of the


14

red brief, at the very top.

15

of page 9a, Congress prohibited a recipient from having a


16

policy of releasing education records, quote, unless there


17

is written consent from the students' parents.

18

did not say, unless there is a policy of obtaining written


19

consent.

20
21
22

Congress


Congress thereby --

QUESTION:

Brinkmann?

In 1232g(b)(2)(A), at the top


Now, you're reading from 9a, Ms.


Whereabouts on page 9a?

MS. BRINKMANN:

At the very top, Your Honor,


23

paragraph 2 begins that no fund shall be given to an


24

agency, and explains that has a policy or --


25

QUESTION:

-- see it either.

8

MS. BRINKMANN:

9

It's on page 8a of the --


You're switching briefs on us.


brief, if you prefer that.

I'm sorry.


It's on page 8a of the blue

The problem is, there are


10

other provisions in here I need to refer to.

11

top of the page, it explains that no funds shall go to a


12

school that has a policy of releasing information, and at


13

the end of that first paragraph, quote, unless, and then


14

we go to subparagraph (A), there is written consent from


15

the students' parents.


16

At the very


Congress did not say, unless the school has a


17

policy of obtaining consent.


18

QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

It says no money will


19

go to an educational agency or institution which has a


20

policy or practice.


21

MS. BRINKMANN:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. BRINKMANN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Unless.


Unless.

Yes.


Now, if you don't have a policy or


practice, the whole provision doesn't apply.

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

If you don't have a policy or


2

practice of releasing information other than under the


3

preceding (b)(1), you're correct, Your Honor.


4
5

QUESTION:

The whole thing wouldn't apply, so I


don't --


6

MS. BRINKMANN:

And (b)(2)(A) is -- (b)(1) says


7

you can't -- a school can't have a policy of releasing


8

without consent, other than to certain categories.


9

QUESTION:

It's a question of whether you read


10

the word policy, what policy?

11

reading it as, what policy?


12

MS. BRINKMANN:

13

QUESTION:

14

I think Justice Scalia is


It's a policy --


A policy of releasing records without


written consent.


15

MS. BRINKMANN:

16

not what (b)(2)(A) says.

17

the without consent is in (b)(1).

18

says, has a policy or practice of releasing or providing


19

access to any personally identifiable information, other


20

than direct information, or is permitted under paragraph


21

(1).

22

23

going to require parental consent.


24
25

That's not what not -- that's

That language is not -- that is,

It's not in (b)(2).

That's what paragraph (1) does.

It

do you think the unless goes to?

MS. BRINKMANN:

MS. BRINKMANN:

9

QUESTION:

What


I take it that the


Yes.


Unless.

Yes.


Okay.


10

MS. BRINKMANN:

11

QUESTION:

So --


But that whole provision, no funds


12

shall be made available, only applies to an educational


13

agency or institution which has a policy or practice of


14

releasing.


15

MS. BRINKMANN:

16

QUESTION:

Absolutely.


If it doesn't have a policy or


17

practice of releasing, it's entirely exempt from that


18

provision.


19

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor,


20

because they did not -- Congress did not intend to go


21

after inadvertent releases.


22

For example, the school makes a decision if they


23

are going to have a policy of releasing information to a


24

scholarship program, or to the press, and if they have a


25

policy release, they have to abide by this very specific

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

requirement in (b)(2)(A).


2

QUESTION:

Well --


3

MS. BRINKMANN:

They may choose not to.

It's


4

parallel to the directory information provision in the


5

statute.


6

Congress also said, you, school, can make a


7

choice.

If you want to release things like names,


8

classes, awards receipts under the directory information


9

provision, you can make that decision.

You have to give


10

notice at the beginning of the year, and you have to give


11

parents enough time to respond whether or not they want to


12

opt out of that.


13

Same thing under (b)(2)(A).

If you as a


14

university decide that you want to have a policy or


15

practice of releasing things beyond what is already


16

authorized under (b)(1), which includes other teachers,


17

emergency situations, Federal officials, all kinds of


18

situations, then you have to abide by (b)(2)(A), and you


19

cannot have that policy or practice unless there is


20

written consent from the students' parents.


21

QUESTION:

But it appears to be a scheme, at


22

least as I read it, just directed at when Federal funds


23

are going to be given to a school, and you determine that


24

by whether the school has a particular policy or practice,


25

and the remedy is withholding funds. I don't see how you

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

extrapolate from this statute the intent to create a


2

private cause of action for damages.


3

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, in addition to the


4

language, unless there is, our position is, because there


5

is that requirement, unless there is written consent from


6

the parent, Congress intended to directly benefit the


7

parents and to say to the parents in a particular


8

situation, you can say no, I don't want this information


9

released.

10
11

Parents may have different decisions based on


whether or not they think it will benefit the child.

QUESTION:

But they can't do that, because I


12

mean, if the information is released and the parent says,


13

I object, the institution can say, oh, I'm sorry, that was


14

just a mistake.

15

released it.

16

there is no absolute right on the part of the parent to


17

prevent it.


18

We don't have that policy.

Too bad.

MS. BRINKMANN:

You know, we


We don't have the policy.

So


There is, Your Honor, because


19

the -- if they do have a policy and practice, it's akin to


20

the standard that the Court adopted in Gebser, and here


21

Congress did that.

22

every institution with inadvertent release, but to the


23

extent, as under Monell, if there is requisite knowledge


24

by the school that they have a policy or practice, they're


25

intending to be releasing information, they are charged


They said, we are not going to charge


30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

with getting the consent from the parents, and again I


2

have to --


3

QUESTION:

The consequence, if they don't get


4

consent from the parents, the express consequence is no


5

funds shall be made available.


6

MS. BRINKMANN:

Which is the commonality in all


7

of the Spending Clause cases that have come before the


8

Court, Your Honor.


9

QUESTION:

Ms. Brinkmann, but not the emphasis,


10

as was pointed out by Mr. Roberts.

11

say, no person shall be, and this starts out with no


12

funds.

13

that uses the no funds shall, instead of no person shall


14

be denied, where this Court has either implied a private


15

right of action, or has found a right which 1983 can then


16

be used to enforce?


17

Title IX, title VI


Do you have any statutes, any spending statutes


MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, there's never


18

been a formula.

19

found a right has included that language, Wright, Wilde,


20

or Blessing, none of them have the language the petitioner


21

and the Solicitor General now urges.


22

None of the statutes where the Court has


In fact, in footnote 12 of the Suter opinion the


23

Court contrasted the language where they were not finding


24

a right to a statute that, quote, said, no Federal payment


25

may be made under this part, and they said, now, there's a

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

specific requirement, so there's no formula.

2

courts have had this language that they're now urging. 


3

The Suter opinion refers to this type of language as being


4

more specific, and it doesn't as a practical matter make


5

any difference what these Spending Clause statutes do say. 


6

If you receive Federal funds, you have to abide by these


7

conditions.


8

QUESTION:

9

question precisely.

None of the


I'm not sure that I gave you my

There are title VI, title IX,


10

statutes that use the formula, no person shall, and under


11

those statutes a right of action has been implied, and


12

what I'm asking is, is there any statute with the


13

language, no funds shall, where a right of action has been


14

implied?


15

MS. BRINKMANN:

No statute of that language has


16

ever come before the Court, Your Honor, and all I'm saying


17

is, there are many other cases in which statutes have been


18

found to accord rights under section 1983 that don't have


19

that no-student-shall language.


20

QUESTION:

What about -- you say, you agree


21

there is no example of a case we've decided where the term


22

is no funds shall?


23

MS. BRINKMANN:

That statute has not come before


24

the Court.

I have to say in the title IX and title VI


25

context, it was a broader inquiry of whether or not there

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was implied cause of action, but in Your Honor's opinion,


2

in Suter, in footnote 12, it does refer to this type of


3

statute and suggests that that is a direct requirement.


4

QUESTION:

If I may --


5

QUESTION:

Well, where is the statute -- the


6

footnote you're quoting speaks in terms of, or addresses


7

the no funds shall?


8
9

MS. BRINKMANN:

The precise language in that


statute which is quoted in that footnote says that no


10

Federal funds payments shall be made, Your Honor.

11

page 361 of the opinion, and it's citing 42 U.S.C. 672(e)


12

that says, quote, for example, no Federal payment may be


13

made under this part, and then it goes on and it says that


14

that is an example of more precise requirements as


15

contrasted to the statute in Suter.

It's on


If I may, there are four other provisions I'd


17

like to speak to in addition to the language, unless there

is.

not just unless there is written consent.

20

has to have included a provision of a copy of what is


21

intended to be released by the school to the parents.

22

parents have to be told why the information is being


23

released, and the parents have to know to whom it is being


24

released. That is exactly what the Court referenced in


25

Blessing about Congress addressing the particular need of

need to know why the information was provided, exactly

what it is, and to whom.

release financial information, personal information about

their household for a scholarship or an honorary award

low income families in the school district.


Parents may think it's fine to

Third, the history of the -- before I go to the


10

history, actually, I want to explain another provision of


11

the statute which I think --


12

QUESTION:

13
14

Two more. You have two more coming. 


You said you had four.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes.

Yes.

Actually, I'm going


15

to jump in, though, because this responds to questions of


16

the Court about the use of the word, right.

17

turn to page 12a in the red brief, subsection (d),


18

1232g(d), is entitled, "Students Rather than Parents'


19

Permission or Consent."

20

permission or consent under (b)(2)(A).

21

permission or consent is referenced in FERPA, and it


22

explains there the purpose of it, to explain that when a


23

student becomes 18, as the student here was, or attending


24

a school of higher education, the permission or consent


25

required, and the rights accorded to the parents of the


If you could

then gives the right to deny permission or consent.

is a direct reference to the rights under (b)(2)(A). 


5

Moreover, as members of the --

That


So we have right, the word right used


7

in (b) as well as in (a), or at least with reference to


8

(b) as well as with reference to (a).


9

MS. BRINKMANN:

Much more precisely, Your Honor,


10

here, because they are specifically talking not just about


11

(b) generically, but about permission or consent.


12
13

QUESTION:

Why does right refer to (b)?

I mean,


rights could refer to (a).


14

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because the whole provision of


15

(d) refers to permission nor consent, Your Honor. There is


16

no permission or --


17

18

No, it says permission or consent of

is that.

MS. BRINKMANN:

But if you look at the structure


of the provision, they are referring to the actual

to know, do I go to the -- when I -- for a college

QUESTION:

The right to inspect after he's 18 is


a right that goes to the student, not to the parent.


6

MS. BRINKMANN:

But Your Honor, this is


7

specifically addressing the permission or consent


8

provision.

9

You can tell by the heading of subsection (d).

Moreover, under (e), as Your Honor pointed out


10

before, the school is obligated to inform parents or


11

students of their rights under the regulations promulgated


12

by the Secretary of Education.

13

required to inform parents and students about is the

Where does


it say that?

MS. BRINKMANN:

It would be in the regulations,


Your Honor.


21

QUESTION:

In the regulations, okay, fine.


22

QUESTION:

Even if we say that you met the three


23

Blessing standards, Blessing still kind of said in that


24

opinion, there's something more, and the more is what


25

seems to be the strongest emphasis of the case that Mr.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Robert and Ms. Millett made, and that is that Congress


2

created an enforcement scheme that they meant to be it,


3

that would be incompatible with individual enforcement.


4

MS. BRINKMANN:

Actually that, ironically, leads


5

me to my third point, in fact.

When you look at this


6

history, Congress clearly was addressing the interest of


7

parents in controlling dissemination of information about


8

their children.

9

were worrying about, information that's gossip,


This is a paradigm example of what they


10

unsubstantiated, never had a chance to respond to it,


11

could have a devastating effect on a student's career.


12

Under petitioner's interpretation --


13

QUESTION:

14

worried about that.

15

eliminate that worry by having the Secretary police the


16

thing, or by having lawsuits to vindicate private rights.


But the issue isn't whether they were

The issue is whether they wanted to


17

MS. BRINKMANN:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, and I think --


I don't see how you advance the ball


19

at all by saying what they were worried about was


20

precisely this thing.

21

stipulate that.


22

I mean, I think Mr. Roberts would

Well, it was the point that


23

Justice Ginsburg brought up before, which actually I think

responds to your inquiry.

prove was false, he would have no avenue to prevent the

6

There was no method at the Department of


QUESTION:

It may not be the ideal remedy.

It


7

may not be the best remedy, and one of the anomalies here


8

that wouldn't be present in title IX is working through


9

1983, where you must have a State action pegged.

Now,


10

here, it happened that there was a connection with a


11

State, with a State officer.

12

private institutions and State officer, but suppose we


13

have two schools, and one is about to give a record to a


14

newspaper, and the other is about to do the same thing,


15

and one is the State university, and one is the private


16

university.


17

The conversation was between


Under your scheme, the private university would


18

be home free, it wouldn't be subject to 1983 liability,


19

but the public would, and I think that would be a strange


20

scheme for Congress to enact.


21

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, actually it's much


22

more complicated than that.

It's just not whether or not


23

suits are available against public or private, because, of


24

course, State universities are often deemed arms of the


25

State, so they're not subject to suit at all.

The only

action that can be brought against a State official is for


2

injunctive relief.

3

secondary schools, as was pointed out in the amicus brief


4

in support of respondent, don't receive Federal funding,


5

so there are a lot of different ways in which there may be


6

different actions, but that is because of 1983 Eleventh

Amendment --

QUESTION:

Moreover, most private elementary and


Well, maybe that shows that 1983


really doesn't fit this pattern, because why -- even, why


10

should certain kinds of institutions be stopped, and


11

others not, from doing the same thing?


12

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because the relationship of


13

students at the private school is different than a


14

relationship with a public school.

15

student at public school is defined by State law.

16

is -- and that's what an action under 1983 is, it's under


17

color of State law.

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

Only universities, Your Honor. 


2

Actually, the amicus brief of the ACLU cites a letter from


3

the Department of Education explaining that the vast


4

majority of private schools, elementary and secondary, do


5

not receive Federal funding, but if I may, I think that


6

the important point here is, the relationship of a student


7

with a private school is different.

8

contractual relationship there, and there may very well be


9

other remedies against a private school arising out of --


There is a


10

for example, here in Exhibit 1 at the trial, the handbook,

That's why


There was --


Ms. Brinkmann, can I come back to

your assertion that there is no right to an injunction,

you can't get an injunction under this act, but you can't


19

get an injunction, even if we accept your theory of the

act.

also that this is their practice or policy.

have to go in --

So what good does that do you?

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because in this case you needed


the testimony of one witness --


5

QUESTION:

Which suggests that you're not


6

vindicating a private right of yours, that somehow what


7

Congress is concerned with is the existence of a policy or


8

practice that it doesn't like, even though --


9

MS. BRINKMANN:

10

QUESTION:

With all due respect --


Even though you're being harmed by


11

this release, under your theory you can't get an


12

injunction against it.


13

MS. BRINKMANN:

14

QUESTION:

15

Unless you show that there's a policy


or practice.


16
17

I respectfully disagree.


MS. BRINKMANN:

You absolutely could get an


injunction, Your Honor.


18

QUESTION:

How so?


19

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because you needed the testimony


20

of one witness in this case who said, we do this all of


21

the time.

22

before --


23

We disclose information to the State agency


QUESTION:

You need that witness, and if you


24

don't have such a witness, you cannot get an injunction,


25

isn't that right?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's right.

That's a matter


2

of proof, and Your Honor, what -- I just have to emphasize


3

that what the provision here goes to with the policy and


4

practice in (b)(2)(A) is Monell, Gebser, it is Congress


5

saying, we're not going to charge every university with


6

this requirement.

7

this decision is made at a high enough level that they


8

would have requisite knowledge, that's the only place in


9

which this section 1983 liability would be triggered.


If they have a policy or practice, if


10

QUESTION:

11

question on the practicality?

12

is ambiguous, et cetera, and I would like you to remove


13

this image from my mind, the image that I have in my mind


14

was an earlier case argued here in this Court, and as a


15

result of the lawyer's argument in that case I focused on


16

the language, educational record, and I realized it's a


17

close question, perhaps, as to whether those words do


18

include things like a gold star the third grade teacher


19

might give out in class, or the statement, you're going to


20

get a bad mark on your report card.


21

Is there -- can I ask you one

Assuming all the language


I suddenly realized it's highly ambiguous, and


22

the lawyer said that he had been cross-examining the


23

school officials on this and related questions in the


24

courtroom for several hours, I thought.

25

for a time, and suddenly it occurred to me, how are they


I mean, at least


42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

teaching or running the school district, and the image


2

that came up in my courtroom was of private actions all


3

over the place trying to bring into court school officials


4

to interpret language which really doesn't explain itself.


5

Therefore, a need for centralized


6

administration, which of course would be harmful to some


7

parents, but counterbalanced by the need for effective


8

school administration, and those were the things in my


9

mind, and that's the image it called up, and I want you to


10

reply to that, because I think that's at the heart of


11

this, at least the practical part.


12

QUESTION:

I think I have at least five answers. 


13

I haven't counted them off.

14

important to realize that that's one of the reasons you


15

have the particularized examination in Blessing.

16

not saying there's a right under every one of these


17

provisions, but if you look at (b)(2)(A), unless there is


18

the specific requirement, the history of it, and also if


19

you compare it to the other release provisions that do not


20

have this kind of right, they say you have to notify the


21

parent, or you have to make the person who's getting it


22

promise to destroy it when they're done with it.

23

don't have this right.


24
25

First of all, I think it's


We are


They


So if you look at this particular right, then

you step back and you realize what the Department of

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Education has been saying.

2

statute.

3

you ask the parents -- tell the parents why and to whom it


4

is going.


5

Schools comply with this


It is clear and simple.

You give them a copy,


In the 28 years since this statute has been


6

enacted, there has been no flood of litigation, despite


7

the fact that the Second Circuit, I think 15 years ago,


8

held that there was a section 1983 cause of action, the


9

Fifth Circuit more than 10 years ago.

There is no Federal


10

court of appeals that has taken petitioner's position. 
 I

11

think in the past 5 or 6 years there have been at least


12

two more circuits.

13

QUESTION:

People comply.

But Ms. Brinkmann, if your -- if the


14

force -- if we accept the force of your argument, then I


15

think we'd have to say, well, Congress really didn't need


16

to bother with the centralized administration provision,


17

and yet Congress did put it in, and it seems to me the


18

most likely reason that it put it in is the reason that


19

Justice Breyer just gave.


20

MS. BRINKMANN:

21

QUESTION:

I think --


So you may have made a good argument


22

for getting rid of it, but as long as it's there, it seems


23

to have the same lesson that his question suggests.


24
25

MS. BRINKMANN:

I think that the FPCO office


serves a admirably meritorious role.

It answers countless


44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

numbers of phone calls and inquiries about this, but its


2

own interpretation of its role I think is really


3

illustrated by footnote 6 in our brief, which is on page


4

35.


5

In 1987, when FPCO changed regulations, it


6

explained that it wasn't going to require schools even to


7

afford them access to education records information


8

because they don't go out and investigate.


9

What more accurately reflects their


10

investigation is allowing schools to submit reports -- and


11

this is quotes -- since its inception, FPCO has not


12

conducted any on-site visits to resolve complaints. 


13

Rather, it has resolved complaints through correspondence


14

and telephone calls with the affected parties, and that


15

works in the vast majority of cases.


16

In the limited number of cases that are brought


17

under FERPA in the Federal courts, Federal and State


18

courts since its enactment, this is the only reported case


19

that anyone has located for punitive damages, and the only


20

other case that had any damages was $1 of nominal damages


21

that we've been able to --


22

QUESTION:

But that may be a very good argument


23

for saying that what Congress had in mind, in effect, in


24

confining the enforcement the way it seems to have done by


25

this exclusive authority provision works in the general

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

run of cases, and therefore there is not a good reason to


2

say that Congress probably would have wanted this private


3

right of action with the punitive damages.


4

MS. BRINKMANN:

I think it works generally, and


5

then you look at the Blessing inquiry to see if Congress


6

intended to create a right, they intended to create a


7

right from all of those reasons I said.

8

there, it's clear, it's mandatory --


9
10

QUESTION:

But we're at the

MS. BRINKMANN:

12

QUESTION:

14

-- we're beyond


stage 1, 2, 3 --


11

13

Once you get


It's -- yes.


-- and we're saying, okay, are there


particular reasons to think that they did not.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Then it's presumptively


15

available, a section 1983 action.

16

cause of action.

17

have a Federal right, you can enforce it in court.

18

against that presumption the petitioner has to carry the


19

heavy burden that this Court has found met only twice, in


20

the Sea Clammers case and Smith v. Robinson.


21

It's not an implied


Congress created 1983 and said, if you


QUESTION:

It is


Why isn't the theory of centralized


22

administration, spelled out in the statute, with the


23

Secretary's office doing this thing, why doesn't that


24

overcome the presumption?


25

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because the presumption has to

46

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be overcome by an enforcement scheme, an administrative


2

scheme that supplants the section 1983 that has some


3

address for a private remedy.


4

QUESTION:

Well, certainly it doesn't have to be


5

a duplicate of section 1983, or there would be no point in


6

saying it supplants it.


7

MS. BRINKMANN:

Absolutely, Your Honor, but here


8

there is absolutely no availability for any remedy for an


9

individual injury, and Sea Clammers --


10

QUESTION:

Ms. Brink --


11

QUESTION:

Well now, wait a minute.

As I


12

understand it, people who are aggrieved by some practice


13

in the schools can get a hold of the Secretary's office


14

and -- by a phone call and perhaps by the Secretary's


15

action in saying, either you fly right or we'll cut off


16

funds, they do have a remedy.


17

MS. BRINKMANN:

Not under (b)(2)(A), if they


18

have released records.

19

of damages compensation for an individual, and the Court


20

has looked at that role of the administrative scheme in


21

its line of cases, deciding whether or not it was


22

sufficient to supplant this congressionally created right


23

under section 1983.

24

QUESTION:

25

There's no provision for any kind


In the two cases --

Ms. Brinkmann, can you give us one


other example of a right that depends upon whether the

1

person allegedly violating the right has done it before?


2

MS. BRINKMANN:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.


Or has a policy or practice of doing


4

it?

For example, you know, your right to be free from


5

unreasonable searches and seizures.

about the Monell case.

11

MS. BRINKMANN:

12
13

I was going to cite the Monell


No, no, no.

-- exactly what the Monell case


is about.

QUESTION:

That depends on whom you can sue. 


14

That depends upon whom you can assert the right against,


15

but against the individual you can assert that right,


16

whether there's a policy or practice or not.

17

simply the question of whether you can reach the


18

municipality, but I cannot think of a single other right


19

in the world which only exists as a right when somebody is


20

a two-time loser, or has a policy, or practice.


21

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's

may not have injured anyone in the past.

otherwise in violation of the privacy rights of students.

I don't believe so, Your Honor. 


I have to --

QUESTION:

Does it refer to existing State

privacy rights, or just sort of a moral notion of what


20

things should be kept private?


21

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, I have to emphasize, our


22

statutory argument about rights is not based solely on the


23

1232g(d) referenced rights.

24

there is consent from the parents, and on this

particularized consent required, giving parents a copy,

under the Blessing standard it was intended to benefit


3

parents and to address their specific needs to protect


4

their children from information they have never been


5

informed about, as in this case, that destroyed this


6

person's career.


7

That's exactly what Congress was aiming at, and


8

without -- in petitioner's position there was absolutely


9

nothing that anyone can do to protect that right.

Department of Education cannot give individual relief, and

Honor, if I may.

First of all, deformation would not

make clear, what I think -- first of all, this involved

compensatory damages, just not punitive, but of course


4

this Court's ruling will affect injunctive actions also,


5

but in this case, because this information was released at


6

the very outset of this investigation, it affected the

school's decision about whether or not to issue an


8

affidavit to my client.


9

There was disagreement -- even as it stood,


10

without any information from my client to say this was


11

false, there was disagreement amongst the school officials


12

about whether or not to issue this, and plaintiff's

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.


19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


20

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Your Honor.


21

Two statutes enacted within 2 years of each


22

other:

title IX, no person shall be subject to


23

discrimination; FERPA, no funds shall be made available to


24

an institution that has a policy or practice described in


25

the statute, and the Secretary shall deal with violations,

51
Alderson Reporting Company

1

and the Secretary shall do that at one place, because


2

we're worried about multiple interpretations causing


3

confusion.


4

Now, that is two -- those are two very different


5

ways of approaching a problem.

6

precedents the former, the title IX model confers


7

privately enforceable rights.

8

would Congress proceed differently in dealing with


9

educational institutions in those two different contexts? 


10

Because of the appreciation that the regulation of student


11

records from kindergarten through graduate school directly


12

implicated pedagogical concerns.


13

Under this Court's


The latter does not.

Why


It would have been a radical notion, even in


14

1974, for Congress to confer individual rights on every


15

student from kindergarten to graduate school in a way that


16

would directly implicate the day-to-day running of schools


17

across the country, and there's no evidence to suggest


18

that that's what Congress had in mind.


19

The evidence is the opposite.

It proceeded


It said, this is directed to the Secretary. 


20

gingerly.

21

It's directed to policies and practice.

22

deal with violations?

23

violations, and do it in one place.

24

FERPA was enacted, in response to what was called by the


25

sponsors the perplexity and frustration it had caused --


Who's going to


Mr. Secretary, deal with

Four months after

6

The reason?

We're afraid of multiple

after all, answerable to the Secretary.

by the Federal funds requirement, that would give rise to

15

QUESTION:

They're answerable to us, presumably. 


We could take care of all of that, right?


16

(Laughter.)


17

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, it is implausible to suppose


18

that the same Congress that was so worried about multiple


19

interpretations of the law from the regional offices of


20

one Department would have been perfectly content and, in


21

fact, intended to confer the right for every one of 62


22

million students to go into court in a 1983 action.
