ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FLEMING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Hernandez-Casillas, the Attorney General

11

confirmed that a lawful permanent resident subject to

12

deportation, quote, "must have the same opportunity to

13

seek discretionary relief as an alien who has

14

temporarily left this country and upon reentry been

15

subject to exclusion."

16

Two months later in its published decision

17

in Matter of Meza, the BIA again confirmed that an

18

immigrant deportable for an aggravated felony could seek

19

relief because his conviction could also form the basis

20

for excludability.

21

indistinguishable from Mr. Judulang's applied for and

22

received relief under this rule.

23

Immigrants in situations

The BIA's decision in Blake changed the law.

25

I agree, Matter of Wadud is the

And that's confirmed later in the case of

20

Matter of Jimenez-Santillano, which also involved a 1546

conviction, where the BIA says that if Mr. Jimenez had

22

left the country and returned, it appears that he would

23

not have been inadmissible, and compares that situation

24

to someone convicted of a firearms offense, which the

25

board and the Attorney General had always said were not

2

To the extent there's any ambiguity in the

3

language that Your Honor read, it could not have

4

survived the Attorney General's decision in

5

Hernandez-Casillas, which I just quoted at the beginning

of the presentation, which said that what one looks to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

there was a statutory counterpart problem.

that do to your argument if that's the way one

3

understood Blake?

4

MR. FLEMING:

What would

Obviously, Justice Kagan, we

5

don't think that is the proper way to understand Blake.

6

But to answer the question, for purposes of the

7

retroactivity analysis, the Court uses what the Court in

8

St. Cyr called "considerations of fair notice,

9

reasonable reliance, and settled expectations."

And we

10

would submit that reliance was more than reasonable and

11

expectations more than settled as to how the board was

12

addressing crime of violence aggravated felony

13

convictions prior to Blake, as is shown by the evidence

14

that I cited a minute ago, namely the position that the

15

government itself was taking in these cases and the way

16

that immigrants would have been advised by both criminal

17

defense counsel and immigration counsel, including, for

18

that matter, INS trial counsel.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, reliance on confused

20

law is certainly not reasonable reliance.

21

you accept the -- the premise that Justice Kagan

22

operates from, how can you say that -- that you're

23

reasonably relying on confused law?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. FLEMING:

Well, that's a -

-- that the law was confused.
That's a different point.

But even if -- even if there

5

was some lack of clarity in the law, and we don't think

6

there was, I think the record in this -- before the

7

Court is very clear, that people were advised by

8

competent counsel and that the government itself took

9

the same position in front of the immigration courts and

10

the courts of appeals that someone with a crime of

11

violence aggravated felony conviction could seek relief

12

because that conviction would make him or her

13

excludable.

14

deportation proceedings is meant to be the same as it

15

would be in exclusion proceedings.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the availability of relief in

17

advice of counsel, but what is the reasonable

expectation of that's been altered?

MR. FLEMING:

The reasonable expectation

20

that once someone pleads guilty, Mr. Chief Justice, to

21

an excludable offense, one that would be waivable in

22

exclusion proceedings, that a waiver may be sought in

23

subsequent deportation proceedings on exactly the same

24

basis.

And that is -

-- that the

expectation is when he pleads guilty to a violent

felony, that he expects, well, if I'm deported because

6

of that I am going to be able to seek discretionary

7

waiver?

9

MR. FLEMING:
Mr. Chief Justice.

Yes, that's quite correct,

That's the ruling in St. Cyr, that

10

when someone is -- when someone pleads guilty to an

11

offense that is eligible for relief under section

is facing a serious charge and is entering a plea

that's a very likely situation.

because he could seek 212(c) protection.

For them, section 212(c) is

very important, and they could rely on its availability,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay, but there's a large

11

category of people who -- who plead guilty to crimes

12

that do not involve moral turpitude and yet are not

13

otherwise excludable under 212(c), right?

14

MR. FLEMING:

I don't know which category

15

Your Honor is thinking of.

16

plead guilty to a crime that does not involve moral

17

turpitude; then you would not be eligible for section

18

212(c) relief; but there might be some other way that

19

you can -- that you can get at it.

20

But, certainly, you can

But that is not this category of people.

21

The category of people at issue here are people who pled

22

before 1996 to aggravated felony crimes of violence,

23

almost all of which, if not all of which, are going to

24

be crimes involving moral turpitude that are excludable

25

and therefore eligible for a waiver.

they have the right to ask the Attorney General to

11

The remaining question for purposes of the

retroactivity analysis is only the strength of the

13

agency's interest in applying the rule retroactively.

14

I'd submit that that interest here is no stronger than

15

it is in the ordinary mine run of cases, and in fact it

16

is weaker, because all that we are talking about is the

17

opportunity to submit an application for adjudication on

"We shall

cases has gone off along the wrong track quite a while

17

St. Cyr should have been overruled on that basis.

19

It -- it seems to

responses to that, Justice Kennedy.

The first is the

agency has accepted that in Matter of Silva as a correct

11

interpretation of the statute, and that has been on the

12

books for 35 years now, approximately, and Congress has

13

never suggested any disapproval of it.

14

contrary, it has assumed that that is the law.

15

that's after the Solicitor General refused to seek

16

certiorari of that decision.

deportation.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, if we thought that

20

they had gone down the wrong path originally, there's

21

nothing we can do about it, and we just say we're in

22

this wilderness and we can't get out?

23

MR. FLEMING:

I think, Justice Kennedy,

24

Congress at this point has not only acquiesced but

25

indicated its understanding of the -- of the way that
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the agency has applied the law.

2

this is a -- a question for the Government, because the

3

agency has never suggested that there was any basis for

4

retreating from that position at this late date.

5

And, honestly, I think

Unless the Court has further questions on

6

retroactivity, I would move quickly to our substantive

7

position, which is that even without regard to

8

retroactivity, the Blake rule is arbitrary and

9

capricious.

And there are two basic reasons for that:

10

First, that it rests on improper factors; and, second,

11

that it leads to results that the BIA itself has

12

disavowed.

13

First of all, Congress has never suggested

14

that the words that it chooses in deportation provisions

15

are somehow a key to eligibility for section 212(c)

16

relief.

17

board relied on in Blake, was a comparison of the choice

18

are excludable.

MR. FLEMING:

Well, the board in Blake

2

concluded that that was -- that the linguistic

3

comparison worked there so that it did not have to find

4

itself at odds with this Court's decision in St. Cyr.

5

That's true.

6

board originally made that decision in Matter of Meza,

7

they didn't just look to the linguistic comparison.

8
9

But when the Court -- when the

I agree that if there's a perfect linguistic
match, then you might not need to go to look at the

10

conviction, because someone who falls under one will

11

necessarily fall under the other.

12

Congress uses different words in the deportation

13

subsection that's asserted against a particular alien

14

doesn't mean that the analysis stops there, because the

15

conviction might well make the person excludable such

16

that the application that they're able to file in

deportation proceedings should give them the same relief

as they would have in exclusion proceedings.

But just because

So, what happened in 1990 when "crime of

that that was a radical change in section 212(c)

it could have said that.

that broad premise that the government could develop a

system which treated those two groups differently?

Do you dispute

most salient example is the one that the Government

admits on page 26 of its brief, which is that the -

3

in the Jimenez-Santillano decision and also in firearms

that the board had been consistent in firearms offenses.

involving moral turpitude?

2

MR. GANNON:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

The

3

board pointed out in the Brieva-Perez decision that

4

minor but relatively common crimes of violence,

5

including simple assaults and burglary, generally are

6

not considered to be crimes involving moral turpitude.

7

In the reply brief, Petitioner points to a

8

board opinion in Louissaint saying that the -- that the

9

record is muddled on burglary, but that opinion only

10

showed that residential burglary isn't a crime involving

11

moral turpitude, and a crime of violence, in the

12

definition, is one that involves the use of physical

13

force against person or property of another.

14
15

And so, it doesn't need to be aggravated in
any other sense.

16
17

It doesn't need to be -

trying to say, Justice Ginsburg, is that Petitioner's

23

approach of looking to the conviction is inconsistent

24

with the board's repeated -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Look to the category.

And

5

the category here is not -- you know, the category isn't

6

crime; the category is what kind of a crime.

is a crime of violence.

at what was charged, it's called voluntary manslaughter.

Either way, I would think those categories as categories

11

MR. GANNON:

Well, but the category that is

relevant is the crime of violence.

of violence that satisfy the statutory definition in 18

Well, if I -
Thank you.

If I could finish up on the

24

firearms analogy, I think that this is responsive,

25

Justice Breyer, to your point about looking at the
31

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

category, and that in Montenegro, the board specifically

2

concluded that this offense, assault with a firearm -

3

it's a firearms offense, but because we've already

4

concluded that as a categorical matter, firearms

5

offenses aren't on the list of exclusion crimes; we

6

don't care and we're not going to ask ourselves whether

7

it could have been a crime involving moral turpitude.

8
9
10

The board applied that same reasoning again
in a 1995 opinion, in Espinoza.

We quote all of these

opinions on page 41 of our brief.

11

And so, in these two categories, firearms

12

offenses and visa fraud offenses, both of which could

13

often involve moral turpitude on an -- in any individual

14

case -- that such offenses could involve moral

15

turpitude, just like a crime of violence may well

16

involve moral turpitude.

17

that because as a categorical matter, this is not

18

comparable to any ground of exclusion, it was going to

19

say that it was not going to extend this relief, that -

And yet, the board concluded

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

What -- what -
Let's let Justice

Sotomayor jump in now with her question.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I go back to

24

Justice Breyer's question.

What you just said made

25

logical sense; the category of gun possession doesn't go
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

in.

Visa fraud doesn't become a crime of moral

2

turpitude.

3

generically, manslaughter, which involves violence, is a

4

crime of moral turpitude.

5

abuse of a minor.

6

think that that category of crimes, whether you call it

7

indecency, touching, or -- we've already said touching

8

alone may not qualify, but my point is you now are

9

saying, I think -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- that

But we have cases that have said,

Others have qualified sexual

aggravated violent felons is an entire category, and

11

anything that falls under that label can't be a ground

12

of exclusion.

13

MR. GANNON:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16

No -
That's how I read your

categorical comparison now.
MR. GANNON:

No, the board has made it clear

17

from as early as the Meza decision that it would look

18

into the specific category within the definition of

19

aggravated felony -

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR GANNON:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24
25

All right.

So, now -

-- in order to do a categoric -
-- why is manslaughter

not a crime of moral turpitude?
MR. GANNON:

Because that's not the category

in the aggravated felony definition that we're talking
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about.

2

That's the category.

3

What we're talking about is crimes of violence.
And so -

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Gannon, suppose

4

this:

5

category of crimes of moral turpitude, and suppose on

6

the deportation side, which I think is right, you have a

7

category called crimes of violence, and you also have a

8

category called crimes of moral turpitude.

9

time limit on that.

10
11
12

Suppose that on the exclusion side, you have this

MR. GANNON:

There's a

We do have that category here.

Right.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's right.

Suppose that

13

you -- the government could have slotted manslaughter

14

into either of those categories on the deportation side.

15

And I understand that there's a dispute about whether it

16

could have, but let's suppose it could have.

17

manslaughter is categorized on the deportation side as a

18

crime of violence, you say it doesn't match with the

19

category on the exclusion side.

20

So, if

But if the same crime is categorized in a

21

different way by the government, then it does match on

22

the exclusion side.

23

government's decision about how to categorize a given

24

offense on the deportation side is going to determine

25

whether a person gets relief.

So, what sense does that make?

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that there's no

MR. GANNON:

6

If

The Petitioner just says -

-- it could have been charged

either way.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The Petitioner just says we

8

look to manslaughter, and we ask whether that qualifies

9

a person for relief on the exclusion side -

10

MR. GANNON:

And what I'm trying -

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you're saying, no,

12

first, we have to put manslaughter in a category on the

13

deportation side, and then we have to match that to the

14

category on the exclusion side.

15

is kind of what sense does that make?

16

everything depend on which category you put manslaughter

17

into?

18

MR. GANNON:

And what I'm asking you
Doesn't

Well, what it -- the reason it

19

makes sense is because the statute only provides for

20

relief from grounds of inadmissibility or exclusion.

21

By its terms -

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You are so far from the

23

statute, Mr. Gannon, you can't even tell what's closer

24

to the statute.

25

statute.

I mean, you are miles away from the

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. GANNON:

Well, the way -- the way this

2

doctrine developed, Justice Kagan, is that it developed

3

in the context where the board recognized that the

4

statute only applied to waiver of grounds of

5

excludability, and it extended that to deportation cases

6

when it was on the basis of the same grounds that could

7

have been presented in an exclusion proceeding.

8
9

And so, that's all we're trying to do here,
is to continue without -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what your position

11

means that it's up to the agency -- up to the person who

12

makes the charge, because take Mr. Judulang, he could

13

have been categorized as deportable because he committed

14

a crime involving moral turpitude, or he could have been

15

categorized as somebody who committed an aggravated

16

felony.

17

who is making the charge whether there will be a match

18

or not.

It is then totally in the hands of the person

19

MR. GANNON:

The reason why that's so is

20

because the thing that is going to be waived at the end

21

of the proceeding is the -- is the ground of

22

deportation.

23

for an aggravated felony crime of violence, then it

24

needs to be one for which there's 212(c) eligibility.

25

The same would be true if it were a firearms offense.

And so, if the ground of deportation is

36

Alderson Reporting Company

1

If it were -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that doesn't -- if

3

the -- if the officer labels the manslaughter in this

4

case a crime involving moral turpitude, then there's a

5

match -

6

MR. GANNON:

That's -

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if he labels it

aggravated felony crime of violence, then there's no

9

match.

10

So, it's up to the charger whether there will be

this match or not.

11

MR. GANNON:

That's true.

It's also true in

12

the firearms offense cases and the visa fraud offense

13

cases, because those are all instances in which,

14

depending on the circumstance of the offense and

15

depending upon what it was charged, the board has

16

concluded that the 1546 offense is divisible.

17

those crimes are involving moral turpitude; some of them

18

are not.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But this isn't a question

20

about the history, Mr. Gannon.

21

you are right about the history, this is a question

22

about whether this is an arbitrary system, and where

23

you're devising it from and what lies behind it.

24
25

MR. GANNON:

Even if we assume that

And I think that this is not

only consistent with the history; it's consistent with
37

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the text of the regulation that Petitioner is invoking

2

here, which makes it clear that what is being waived is

3

a ground of exclusion or deportability or removability.

4

And so, what's relevant is whether the

5

ground of removability is the aggravated felony crime of

6

violence ground or the crime involving moral turpitude

7

ground.

8

he's seeking relief for -

9

Depending on which ground it is, that's what

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then -- then you have to

10

say, yes, you can have somebody who would get a waiver

11

of inadmissibility for a crime and the very next day be

12

put in deportation without any waiver for that same

13

crime.

14

MR. GANNON:

Well, we have no cases in which

15

that has happened.

And the cases in which the board

16

said that that result would be clearly repugnant were

17

ones in which there was a comparable ground.

MR. GANNON:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

MR. GANNON:

25

But I'm giving you -

-- these categories -

Pardon?
These categories.

No, there -- there are no cases

that address that principle in the context where there
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is no comparable ground.

2

one point about this claim of Petitioner's in his reply

3

brief, that he could have been subject to a charge of

4

deportability on the basis of a crime involving moral

5

turpitude, I would caution the Court against relying on

6

that for two reasons, one factual and one legal.

7

And if -- if I could just make

One is that there's no factual basis in the

8

administrative record to -- to talk about this 1987 trip

9

to the Philippines.

We do have evidence from outside

10

the record that makes us believe that it occurred, but

11

the statute that provides for judicial review here of

12

the order of removability in 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(4)(A)

13

specifically says that the determination needs to be

14

made on the basis of the administrative record.

15

only evidence in the record about that trip is actually

16

a statement from Petitioner's mother that says that it

17

occurred in 1989, the year after the crime.

18

And the

But even assuming that -- that the trip

19

happened, in light -- as I said, we do believe on the

20

basis of evidence outside the record that it did occur

21

-- there's a legal reason why I would caution the Court

22

against assuming that that means the Petitioner could

23

have been deportable for a crime involving moral

24

turpitude, and that's the so-called Fleuti doctrine.

25

Under this Court's 1963 decision in Rosenberg v. Fleuti,
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which is actually relevant to a case on which you

2

granted certiorari a couple of weeks ago, this Court

3

concluded that if an LPR takes a brief, casual, and

4

innocent trip outside the country and returns to the

5

United States, that will not trigger an entry upon his

6

return to the United States.

7

And so, I think it's very likely that under

8

Ninth Circuit precedent, in 1989 when Petitioner was

9

pleading guilty to his voluntary manslaughter charge, he

10

wouldn't have had any reason to think that he was doing

11

so within 5 years of when he committed -- when he

12

entered the country for purposes of the statute.

13

I think it's also -

21

gun crimes, and I look at crime of violence.

I'd only do it for the sake of this question.
The

And then I look at

My non-schooled reaction is, well, gun

23

crimes, I can see why they said that wasn't really a

24

crime of moral turpitude, because there are a lot of

registration requirements, there are all kinds of

Now, I think crimes of violence, I say, hey,

I am having trouble here.

Why don't you try to list a

8

few crimes of violence that when they come into the

9

country you're going to say, oh, that wasn't a crime of

10

moral turpitude?

list specific examples; I am asking you to list

12

categories.

when the person comes in, you're going to say, hmm, no

14

moral turpitude there.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're saying good-bye to

Jackson and Thornburgh, because you have driven such a

5

wedge between these two statutes that there's hardly

anybody who would be able to qualify for the Jackson-

Thornburgh approach to this statute.

8

MR. GANNON:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11

I just -
I overstate slightly, but

you see my point.
MR. GANNON:

I see your point,

12

Justice Breyer, and if you look at all of the cases that

13

predate the era that we're talking about here, they all

14

-- almost all involve two categories of offenses, drug

15

trafficking or controlled substance offenses and crimes

16

involving moral turpitude, things that were actually

17

charged under the ground of deportation for crimes

18

involving moral turpitude.

19

And here, Congress added aggravated felonies

20

to the deportation side of the ledger but didn't add it

21

to the exclusion side of the ledger.

22

repeatedly expanded the definition of "aggravated

23

felony" between 1988 and 1996 in ways that made these

24

offenses treatable in different ways for purposes of

25

deportation than they were for exclusion.

Alderson Reporting Company

And then it

And as a category -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

to my question.

4

aggravated violent felony.

5

you're looking at.

6

That -- that is your test.

7
8

There's only one category now,

9

That's the only category

It doesn't matter, in your judgment.

MR. GANNON:
Sotomayor.

Well, I keep going back

That's -- I disagree, Justice

If -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If it qualifies as an

10

aggravated violent felon, it cannot be a crime of moral

11

turpitude.

12
13
14

MR. GANNON:

I disagree with that -- the

fact that that's the category we're looking at.
We're looking inside the definition of

15

aggravated felony, to the particular ground which is

16

crimes of violence.

17

the analysis needs to be done at a categorical level.

18

And the board has said that you cannot get a 212(c)

19

waiver from a ground of deportability unless that ground

20

of deportability is substantially equivalent to a

21

waivable ground of exclusion.

22

And then what we are saying is that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's go back to a

23

concrete example following Justice Ginsburg's example.

24

Someone is charged with a crime of violence, voluntary

25

manslaughter.

And would an officer at the airport say
44

you're not admittable; that's a crime involving moral

turpitude?

Could the officer say that?

MR. GANNON:

Now -

We're talking about pre-1996

offenses.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now let's assume that he

13

did, that he waives that crime of moral turpitude.

across and would prevent this alien from being

deportable in a subsequent proceeding, an important

purpose would still be served by encouraging the alien

concluded would be a rational basis for differential

treatment in encouraging aliens to seek 212(c) waivers

You're also telling me

argument -- that if we have Jack the cat burglar who was

of excluding that person, should he try -- I've heard

criticisms of our immigration policy, but this seems

surprising to me, that we have no way of excluding that

buildings and assaults.

13

crime, which would be -- could potentially be a ground

14

for exclusion, would automatically guarantee that -

15

that the alien could receive a waiver of any ground of

16

deportability based on the same conviction.

MR. GANNON:

Could I ask just a

4

practical question?

5

when there are no more St. Cyr people?

6

any -- there's no 212(c) anymore.

7

Does this issue go away finally

MR. GANNON:

Meaning is there

Well, there -- there's a new

8

provision, cancellation of removal, which indisputably

9

just simply is unavailable to anyone with a aggravated

10

felony conviction.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. GANNON:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Exactly.

And -- and -
And so, really the issue

14

that we have at the moment is whether your decision to

15

effect what has happened now in the past, to do what

16

Congress has done moving forward, and to avoid St. Cyr,

17

is just to say, if it's an aggravated crime of violence,

18

it just doesn't qualify anymore.

19
20
21

That's what you are doing.

You're not

giving 212(c) to anybody anymore.
MR. GANNON:

Well, we're giving it to aliens

22

like this, aliens who -- who have older convictions,

23

pre-1996 guilty pleas -

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you were just saying

if they're aggravated -- if they've committed an
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

aggravated crime of violence, they're not getting it

2

anymore.

3

MR. GANNON:

That -- that is if it's a crime

4

that was -- a conviction that occurred after 212(c) was

5

repealed.

6

the board considers one of the other charge grounds of

7

deportation -

8

10

So, for instance, in this case, if on remand

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But this whole thing

goes away once all the St. Cyr people have.
MR. GANNON:

Yes, because 212(c) only lives

11

on by virtue of St. Cyr right now.

And I -- but -- but

12

I do want to stress that this -- I think Justice Kagan

13

was correct to point out that this was clarifying a

14

previous state of the law.

15

very clear principles in the cases that are cited on

16

23

reaffirming the statutory counterpart doctrine as it

24

says that he rejects the board's attempts to extend

In fact, he was.

the issue of the factual basis of my client's

Alderson Reporting Company

On

1

deportability at the time of the plea, Mr. Gannon is

2

correct; there's nothing in the administrative record

3

that says that, and that is why this Court typically

4

does not countenance arguments based on the facts by the

5

respondents that are raised only in the brief on the

6

merits.

7

on which a factual record needed to be developed, we

8

could have done it; it would not have been hard.

If anyone had suggested that this was an issue

9

I also want to comment on one point that Mr.

10

Gannon made, which is that the thing that -- that is

11

waived under 212(c) is a ground of deportation.

12

not correct.

inadmissibility.

14

is how the regulations and the decisions have always

excerpts in its brief; and Justice Ginsburg is correct,

sense.

That is the

If it is granted to waive inadmissibility, it

2

subsection based on that same conviction.

3

I thought it was telling, Justice Breyer, in

4

reaction to your question which -- which was seeking an

5

explanation of how this scheme is reasonable, the answer

6

that counsel for the Government gave was that the BIA

7

has been consistent with firearms and visa fraud cases,

8

but there was no explanation as to how the Blake rule as

9

it is now drawn is in any way a reasonable application

10

of the law.

11

Honor pointed out, which is that we have a number of -

12

whether one calls them convictions or whether one calls

13

them categories of crimes -- voluntary manslaughter,

14

aggravated burglary -- recall that we're talking about

15

aggravated felony crimes of violence.

16

I would submit for the reasons that Your

I recognize that if we talk about

17

third-degree burglary, which could be charged on the

18

basis of someone opening an unlocked door and walking

19

across the threshold, maybe that's not a crime involving

20

moral turpitude, but it is probably not an aggravated

21

felony crime of violence either, certainly not in this

22

Court's decision in Leocal.

23

So, I would submit that the Government has

24

not identified a crime that would be both an aggravated

25

felony crime of violence and yet not a crime involving
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

moral turpitude.

The overlap is, I would submit, total.

2

And even if it's not total, that is not the end of our

3

argument because the board itself has said you, don't

4

need a perfect match; you just need substantial overlap.

5

And the overlap is at the very least substantial, if not

6

complete.

7

The crime that was charged in Brieva-Perez

8

itself, unauthorized use of a vehicle under Texas law,

9

has subsequently been held by the Fifth Circuit not to

10

be an aggravated felony at all.

11

own terms is no longer good law, as we point out in our

12

reply brief.

13

So, Brieva-Perez on its

The interest that Mr. Gannon asserted at one

14

point about getting immigrants to put themselves into

15

exclusion proceedings -- this is a very important point.

16

The agency has never suggested that that is the way that

17

it runs the railroad.

18

said the opposite.

On the contrary, it has expressly

19

It does not matter whether the 212(c)

20

application is filed in exclusion proceedings, in

21

deportation proceedings, or outside of proceedings

22

entirely by sending a letter to the district director

23

saying:

24

travel abroad.

25

Please give me an advance waiver before I

The regulations make very clear and the
57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decisions make very clear -- I quoted Matter of A-A- in

2

my opening argument -- that an application is identical

3

and the relief that is given is identical, regardless of

4

the proceedings.

5

For Mr. Gannon to stand up and say that the

6

agency is now creating a sharp distinction, saying that

7

applications filed in exclusion are omnipotent, and

8

applications filed in deportation proceedings are

9

meaningless is a clear change in the law, and it is

10

unfair to apply it against immigrants like Mr. Judulang

11

and others who relied on the availability of section

12

212(c) as protection from removal, whether exclusion or

13

deportation in the future, when they pled guilty.

14

Justice Sotomayor, your question about how

15

many people are involved here, it is difficult to

16

identify specific numbers because very often these cases

17

are decided at the immigration judge level that are not

18

reported.

19

certiorari, we identified over 160 people who have been

20

subject -- who have suffered under the Blake rule since

21

Blake was decided in 2005.

22

In the appendix to our petition for

And part of the problem is that we are

23

talking about a group of people who have been in the

24

country for a long time, whose convictions are dated,

25

who are law-abiding, who are reformed, and may only come

to the attention of the authorities subsequently through

2

perfectly law-abiding conduct such as applying for

naturalization or renewing a green card so that they -

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If they weren't

5

law-abiding, they would have committed a new felony that

6

would render them inadmissible and -

7

MR. FLEMING:

That would potentially -

8

potentially subject them to removal, exactly.

9

and there might be other forms of relief, as Mr. Gannon

10

mentioned.

11

number of the people here who have been harmed by the

12

Blake rule are people who are the most deserving

13

candidates for relief.

14

sets that out I think quite convincingly.

15

But -- that's certainly right.

Now -

But a good

And the NIJC brief, I think,

We would submit that the only reasonable

16

approach here is the one that the agency took for years

17

under Meza and under the eight decisions that Justice

18

Breyer referenced, where the immigration judges knew the

19

rule, they applied it, they looked to the conviction,

20

they figured out whether the conviction would trigger

21

excludability; if it did, then the alien was entitled to

22

apply on the same basis and with the same effect as if

23

he had found himself in exclusion proceedings.
