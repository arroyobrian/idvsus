ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK C. FLEMING

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FLEMING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Hernandez-Casillas, the Attorney General

11

confirmed that a lawful permanent resident subject to

12

deportation, quote, "must have the same opportunity to

13

seek discretionary relief as an alien who has

14

temporarily left this country and upon reentry been

15

subject to exclusion."

16

Two months later in its published decision

17

in Matter of Meza, the BIA again confirmed that an

18

immigrant deportable for an aggravated felony could seek

19

relief because his conviction could also form the basis

20

for excludability.

21

indistinguishable from Mr. Judulang's applied for and

22

received relief under this rule.

4

MR. FLEMING:

What would

Obviously, Justice Kagan, we

5

don't think that is the proper way to understand Blake.

6

But to answer the question, for purposes of the

7

retroactivity analysis, the Court uses what the Court in

8

St. Cyr called "considerations of fair notice,

9

reasonable reliance, and settled expectations."

And we

10

would submit that reliance was more than reasonable and

11

expectations more than settled as to how the board was

12

addressing crime of violence aggravated felony

13

convictions prior to Blake, as is shown by the evidence

14

that I cited a minute ago, namely the position that the

15

government itself was taking in these cases and the way

16

that immigrants would have been advised by both criminal

17

defense counsel and immigration counsel, including, for

18

that matter, INS trial counsel.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But even if -- even if there

was some lack of clarity in the law, and we don't think

6

there was, I think the record in this -- before the

Court is very clear, that people were advised by

competent counsel and that the government itself took

9

the same position in front of the immigration courts and

10

the courts of appeals that someone with a crime of

violence aggravated felony conviction could seek relief

But that is not this category of people.

The category of people at issue here are people who pled

before 1996 to aggravated felony crimes of violence,

be crimes involving moral turpitude that are excludable

23

MR. FLEMING:

I think, Justice Kennedy,

Congress at this point has not only acquiesced but

25

indicated its understanding of the -- of the way that
18

Alderson Reporting Company

the agency has applied the law.

2

this is a -- a question for the Government, because the

3

agency has never suggested that there was any basis for

4

retreating from that position at this late date.

5

And, honestly, I think

Unless the Court has further questions on

6

retroactivity, I would move quickly to our substantive

7

position, which is that even without regard to

8

retroactivity, the Blake rule is arbitrary and

9

capricious.

And there are two basic reasons for that:

10

First, that it rests on improper factors; and, second,

11

that it leads to results that the BIA itself has

12

disavowed.

13

First of all, Congress has never suggested

14

that the words that it chooses in deportation provisions

15

are somehow a key to eligibility for section 212(c)

16

relief.

17

board relied on in Blake, was a comparison of the choice

18

of words in deportation provisions to the choice of

19

words in exclusion provisions.

20

provisions of the deportation statute are not some

21

enigmatic code from which the BIA can discern section

22

212(c) eligibility.

23

but they have nothing to say about who is eligible for

24

section 212(c).

25

And, yet, that is largely everything that the

comparison worked there so that it did not have to find

4

itself at odds with this Court's decision in St. Cyr.

That's true.

7

they didn't just look to the linguistic comparison.

But when the Court -- when the

I agree that if there's a perfect linguistic
match, then you might not need to go to look at the

10

conviction, because someone who falls under one will

11

necessarily fall under the other.

12

Congress uses different words in the deportation

13

subsection that's asserted against a particular alien

14

doesn't mean that the analysis stops there, because the

15

conviction might well make the person excludable such

16

that the application that they're able to file in

as they would have in exclusion proceedings.

But just because

So, what happened in 1990 when "crime of

21

that that was a radical change in section 212(c)

The arbitrariness

Mr. Fleming, the Government

says that it has an interest in treating people in

15

that broad premise that the government could develop a

17

system which treated those two groups differently?

MR. FLEMING:

Do you dispute

That is not the way that the

clearly a change in the law.

Now, the agency cannot have

The

not considered to be crimes involving moral turpitude.

In the reply brief, Petitioner points to a

board opinion in Louissaint saying that the -- that the

record is muddled on burglary, but that opinion only

showed that residential burglary isn't a crime involving

moral turpitude, and a crime of violence, in the

definition, is one that involves the use of physical

force against person or property of another.

this:

category of crimes of moral turpitude, and suppose on

And I understand that there's a dispute about whether it

could have, but let's suppose it could have.

manslaughter is categorized on the deportation side as a

crime of violence, you say it doesn't match with the

20

So, if

But if the same crime is categorized in a

21

different way by the government, then it does match on

doctrine developed, Justice Kagan, is that it developed

in the context where the board recognized that the

is to continue without -­

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what your position

11

means that it's up to the agency -- up to the person who

12

makes the charge, because take Mr. Judulang, he could

13

have been categorized as deportable because he committed

14

a crime involving moral turpitude, or he could have been

15

categorized as somebody who committed an aggravated

16

felony.

17

who is making the charge whether there will be a match

18

or not.

It is then totally in the hands of the person

The reason why that's so is

20

because the thing that is going to be waived at the end

21

of the proceeding is the -- is the ground of

22

deportation.

23

for an aggravated felony crime of violence, then it

needs to be one for which there's 212(c) eligibility.

The same would be true if it were a firearms offense.

If it were -­

cases, because those are all instances in which,

depending on the circumstance of the offense and

depending upon what it was charged, the board has

JUSTICE KAGAN:

about the history, Mr. Gannon.

But I'm giving you -­

Pardon?
These categories.

No, there -- there are no cases

that address that principle in the context where there

Alderson Reporting Company

is no comparable ground.

2

one point about this claim of Petitioner's in his reply

3

brief, that he could have been subject to a charge of

4

deportability on the basis of a crime involving moral

5

turpitude, I would caution the Court against relying on

6

that for two reasons, one factual and one legal.

7

And if -- if I could just make

One is that there's no factual basis in the

8

administrative record to -- to talk about this 1987 trip

9

to the Philippines.

We do have evidence from outside

10

the record that makes us believe that it occurred, but

11

the statute that provides for judicial review here of

12

the order of removability in 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(4)(A)

13

specifically says that the determination needs to be

14

made on the basis of the administrative record.

15

only evidence in the record about that trip is actually

16

a statement from Petitioner's mother that says that it

17

occurred in 1989, the year after the crime.

18

And the

But even assuming that -- that the trip

19

happened, in light -- as I said, we do believe on the

20

basis of evidence outside the record that it did occur

21

-- there's a legal reason why I would caution the Court

22

against assuming that that means the Petitioner could

23

have been deportable for a crime involving moral

24

turpitude, and that's the so-called Fleuti doctrine.

25

Under this Court's 1963 decision in Rosenberg v. Fleuti,
39

which is actually relevant to a case on which you

2

granted certiorari a couple of weeks ago, this Court

3

concluded that if an LPR takes a brief, casual, and

4

innocent trip outside the country and returns to the

5

United States, that will not trigger an entry upon his

6

return to the United States.

7

And so, I think it's very likely that under

8

Ninth Circuit precedent, in 1989 when Petitioner was

9

pleading guilty to his voluntary manslaughter charge, he

10

wouldn't have had any reason to think that he was doing

11

so within 5 years of when he committed -- when he

entered the country for purposes of the statute.

few crimes of violence that when they come into the

moral turpitude?

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. GANNON:

I see your point,

12

Justice Breyer, and if you look at all of the cases that

13

predate the era that we're talking about here, they all

14

-- almost all involve two categories of offenses, drug

15

trafficking or controlled substance offenses and crimes

16

involving moral turpitude, things that were actually

17

charged under the ground of deportation for crimes

18

involving moral turpitude.

19

And here, Congress added aggravated felonies

20

to the deportation side of the ledger but didn't add it

21

to the exclusion side of the ledger.

22

repeatedly expanded the definition of "aggravated

23

felony" between 1988 and 1996 in ways that made these

24

offenses treatable in different ways for purposes of

25

deportation than they were for exclusion.

you're looking at.

It doesn't matter, in your judgment.

MR. GANNON:
Sotomayor.

That's -- I disagree, Justice

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If it qualifies as an

aggravated violent felon, it cannot be a crime of moral

11

turpitude.

MR. GANNON:

I disagree with that -- the

fact that that's the category we're looking at.
We're looking inside the definition of

15

aggravated felony, to the particular ground which is

16

crimes of violence.

17

the analysis needs to be done at a categorical level.

18

And the board has said that you cannot get a 212(c)

19

waiver from a ground of deportability unless that ground

20

of deportability is substantially equivalent to a

21

waivable ground of exclusion.

22

And then what we are saying is that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's go back to a

23

concrete example following Justice Ginsburg's example.

24

Someone is charged with a crime of violence, voluntary

25

purpose would still be served by encouraging the alien

that the alien could receive a waiver of any ground of

provision, cancellation of removal, which indisputably

12

MR. GANNON:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and -­
And so, really the issue

14

that we have at the moment is whether your decision to

15

effect what has happened now in the past, to do what

16

Congress has done moving forward, and to avoid St. Cyr,

17

is just to say, if it's an aggravated crime of violence,

18

it just doesn't qualify anymore.

19
20
21

That's what you are doing.

You're not

giving 212(c) to anybody anymore.
MR. GANNON:

Well, we're giving it to aliens

22

like this, aliens who -- who have older convictions,

23

if they're aggravated -- if they've committed an

aggravated crime of violence, they're not getting it

2

anymore.

MR. GANNON:

That -- that is if it's a crime

5

repealed.

So, for instance, in this case, if on remand

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

goes away once all the St. Cyr people have.
MR. GANNON:

11

And I -- but -- but

12

I do want to stress that this -- I think Justice Kagan

13

was correct to point out that this was clarifying a

14

previous state of the law.

15

very clear principles in the cases that are cited on

questions that Justices Ginsburg and Kagan asked to my

15

involving moral turpitude.

16

looks at the decisions in the appendix to the petition

for certiorari, specifically at page 11a, it's clear

18

that his conviction is asserted not only as an

19

aggravated felony crime of violence, but also as a crime

20

involving moral turpitude, and the immigration judge

21

found that he was in fact deportable with that

22

conviction forming a crime involving moral turpitude.

23

In fact, he was.

language of Matter of G-A-, which the Government itself

23

excerpts in its brief; and Justice Ginsburg is correct,

24

that is -- they admit that a waiver is durable in that

25

sense.

That is the

If it is granted to waive inadmissibility, it

2

subsection based on that same conviction.

3

I thought it was telling, Justice Breyer, in

4

reaction to your question which -- which was seeking an

5

explanation of how this scheme is reasonable, the answer

6

that counsel for the Government gave was that the BIA

7

has been consistent with firearms and visa fraud cases,

8

but there was no explanation as to how the Blake rule as

9

it is now drawn is in any way a reasonable application

10

of the law.

11

Honor pointed out, which is that we have a number of -­

12

whether one calls them convictions or whether one calls

13

them categories of crimes -- voluntary manslaughter,

14

aggravated burglary -- recall that we're talking about

15

aggravated felony crimes of violence.

16

I would submit for the reasons that Your

I recognize that if we talk about

17

third-degree burglary, which could be charged on the

18

basis of someone opening an unlocked door and walking

19

across the threshold, maybe that's not a crime involving

20

moral turpitude, but it is probably not an aggravated

21

felony crime of violence either, certainly not in this

22

Court's decision in Leocal.

23

So, I would submit that the Government has

24

not identified a crime that would be both an aggravated

25

felony crime of violence and yet not a crime involving
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

moral turpitude.

The overlap is, I would submit, total.

2

And even if it's not total, that is not the end of our

3

argument because the board itself has said you, don't

4

need a perfect match; you just need substantial overlap.

5

And the overlap is at the very least substantial, if not

6

complete.

7

The crime that was charged in Brieva-Perez

8

itself, unauthorized use of a vehicle under Texas law,

9

has subsequently been held by the Fifth Circuit not to

10

be an aggravated felony at all.

11

own terms is no longer good law, as we point out in our

12

reply brief.

13

So, Brieva-Perez on its

The interest that Mr. Gannon asserted at one

14

point about getting immigrants to put themselves into

15

exclusion proceedings -- this is a very important point.

16

The agency has never suggested that that is the way that

17

it runs the railroad.

18

said the opposite.

On the contrary, it has expressly

19

It does not matter whether the 212(c)

20

application is filed in exclusion proceedings, in

21

deportation proceedings, or outside of proceedings

22

entirely by sending a letter to the district director

23

saying:

24

travel abroad.

25

Please give me an advance waiver before I

The regulations make very clear and the
57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decisions make very clear -- I quoted Matter of A-A- in

2

my opening argument -- that an application is identical

3

and the relief that is given is identical, regardless of

4

the proceedings.

5

For Mr. Gannon to stand up and say that the

6

agency is now creating a sharp distinction, saying that

7

applications filed in exclusion are omnipotent, and

8

applications filed in deportation proceedings are

9

meaningless is a clear change in the law, and it is

10

unfair to apply it against immigrants like Mr. Judulang

11

and others who relied on the availability of section

12

212(c) as protection from removal, whether exclusion or

13

deportation in the future, when they pled guilty.

14

Justice Sotomayor, your question about how

15

many people are involved here, it is difficult to

16

identify specific numbers because very often these cases

17

are decided at the immigration judge level that are not

18

reported.

19

certiorari, we identified over 160 people who have been

20

subject -- who have suffered under the Blake rule since

21

Blake was decided in 2005.

22

In the appendix to our petition for

And part of the problem is that we are

23

talking about a group of people who have been in the

24

country for a long time, whose convictions are dated,

25

who are law-abiding, who are reformed, and may only come

to the attention of the authorities subsequently through

perfectly law-abiding conduct such as applying for

naturalization or renewing a green card so that they -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If they weren't

5

law-abiding, they would have committed a new felony that

6

would render them inadmissible and -­

7

MR. FLEMING:

That would potentially -­

8

potentially subject them to removal, exactly.

9

and there might be other forms of relief, as Mr. Gannon

10

mentioned.

11

number of the people here who have been harmed by the

12

Blake rule are people who are the most deserving

13

candidates for relief.

14

sets that out I think quite convincingly.

15

But -- that's certainly right.

Now -­

But a good

And the NIJC brief, I think,

We would submit that the only reasonable

16

approach here is the one that the agency took for years

17

under Meza and under the eight decisions that Justice

18

Breyer referenced, where the immigration judges knew the

19

rule, they applied it, they looked to the conviction,

20

they figured out whether the conviction would trigger

21

excludability; if it did, then the alien was entitled to

22

apply on the same basis and with the same effect as if

23

he had found himself in exclusion proceedings.

24
25

The judgment should be reversed, and Mr.
Judulang should be entitled to file his application for
