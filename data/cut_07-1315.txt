CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument this afternoon in Case 07-1315, Knowles v.

5

Mirzayance.

Mr. Mercer.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MERCER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Under the deferential review required by the

12

ADPA, Mr. Mirzayance was not entitled to Federal habeas

13

corpus relief on his ineffective counsel claim because

14

the State court adjudication of that claim was not

15

contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, the

16

clearly established Strickland test.

17

Strickland rule is a general one, the California Supreme

18

Court had wide latitude in resolving that claim.

19

And because the

In this case, the Ninth Circuit applied

20

something different from Strickland, finding that Wager

21

was duty-bound to present a State law affirmative

22

defense because no other defenses were said to be

23

available at that time and because it merely might have

24

worked.

25

Court has never announced such a test.

But even the Ninth Circuit conceded that this

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At some point during the

2

oral argument, and perhaps at the beginning because it

3

is the beginning inquiry:

4

hearing, how does the standard for the court of appeals

5

differ than when there has been no evidentiary hearing?

6

MR. MERCER:

When there is an evidentiary

Well, I think it depends on

7

whether the Federal habeas court is doing a section

8

2254(d) analysis.

9

example, doesn't speak to denying a claim on the merits,

The fact is that section 2254(d), for

10

even if it's unexhausted.

So, in theory, a Federal

11

habeas court could perhaps accept new evidence that the

12

State court never had before it in order to deny relief.

13

But we cannot envision a situation where it would ever

14

be efficacious to hold a hearing in light of -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. MERCER:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let me put it -

-- a Let me put it this way:

18

We're the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, let's

19

assume.

20

court did, and how would that -- how would the case be

21

different than if we were simply reviewing the same

22

situation and it came from the State court?

23

difference?

What effect do we give to what the district

MR. MERCER:

What's the

Well, there shouldn't be a

difference.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We just pretend the

hearing didn't happen?

3

MR. MERCER:

Well, I would say that in

4

virtually every case it, in fact, is a meaningless

5

distraction from what the State court did based on the

6

record presented it, and here's why.

7

State court made a reasonable adjudication of the merits

8

of the claim based on the State court record, then even

9

holding a hearing wouldn't make any difference because

10

Because if the

relief would still be precluded under 2254(d).

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do we look to the Federal

12

court evidentiary hearing as part of the analysis to

13

determine whether what the State court did was

14

reasonable?

15

about this, and obviously the problem is, since the

16

California appellate courts didn't see the hearing, this

17

is an artificial exercise, and you know the problem.

18

And you -- and you have -- you have thought

MR. MERCER:

Well, I think, again, the only

19

question that matters is the 2254(d) question that says

20

that relief shall not be granted unless that State court

21

adjudication based on the State court record presented

22

was unreasonable, and here is why.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I guess it could be

24

-- it could be if we have an opinion that makes it clear

25

that you -- you must grant an evidentiary hearing in 5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in certain cases.

2

an evidentiary hearing, I guess you could say that that

3

was contrary to established Supreme Court law, couldn't

4

you?

5
6

And if the State court did not grant

MR. MERCER:

Perhaps, and -- and under

extremely rare cases that may -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But unless -- unless there

8

is a Supreme Court requirement that there be an

9

evidentiary hearing, I don't see how holding an

10

evidentiary hearing could show that the State court

11

decision, which was legitimately held without an

12

evidentiary hearing, was contrary to our opinions.

13

don't see how you can do that.

14

MR. MERCER:

I

Well, I agree, Justice Scalia,

15

and this Court said in Holland v. Jackson that the

16

pertinent question is what the State court had in front

17

of it.

18

unfair to find that the State courts made an

19

unreasonable application of law based on facts that they

20

didn't have.

21

And the reason here is simple:

That it is

So -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did at any point -- did

22

the State at any point challenge the correctness, the

23

propriety, of holding the Federal evidentiary hearing?

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

Mr.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And if so, is that before

us?

3

MR. MERCER:

I don't think so.

We -- we

4

disagreed that there should have been an evidentiary

5

hearing in the first place, and we argued that below.

6

It's our position that there should not have been an

7

evidentiary hearing in the first place.

8
9

It's our position that, frankly, this was a
straightforward, routine Strickland case that was

10

uncomplicated, properly adjudicated by the district

11

court when they first reached it in 2001 without a

12

hearing, and that the Ninth Circuit has come at this

13

matter with a -- a chestful of monkey wrenches in the

14

sense that they should not have ordered the evidentiary

15

hearing in the first place, and then when they did, they

16

should not have disregarded the very factfinding that

17

they ordered be done.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- so then -- so then

19

we do look at the facts.

I don't want to take up your

20

or the Court's time on this any more, but I remain

21

puzzled, I have to tell you, about what to do with this

22

hearing.

23

careful factfinding, really.

I went through it at great length.

24

MR. MERCER:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's very

Yes.
But I -- I just don't know

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

how to fit that with the standard when I look at the -

2

the reasonableness of the -- of the State court

3

decision.

4

MR. MERCER:

Well, I don't think it changed

5

the standard because 2254 simply requires an

6

adjudication on the merits, and we have that here.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, would you -- would

8

you agree just as a general rule that unless we find -

9

unless there is some rule under which we can conclude

10

that the State court should have held a hearing, that

11

there is no occasion to have a Federal evidentiary

12

hearing?

13

MR. MERCER:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

Yes, I would agree with that.
That would be the general

proposition.

16

MR. MERCER:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

MR. MERCER:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

And I think Would that -- would

20

that principle have to be clearly established by one of

21

our decisions?

22

MR. MERCER:

I think that question is

23

unclear, Mr. Chief Justice, because this Court did

24

recently say in Landrigan that the decision to hold an

25

evidentiary hearing remains within the sound discretion
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the district court, but in the same sentence said

2

that that discretion was circumscribed by the ADPA.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why should we hold a

4

hearing ourselves in the -- in the hypothetical

5

situation that Justice Souter mentioned?

6

we just reverse the State courts for not having held an

7

evidentiary hearing?

8

it, and let -- let them make the factual determination

9

on the basis of that, after which we would -- we would

Why shouldn't

Remand it to them, let them hold

10

apply the rather strict 2254 standard to -- to the

11

result of that hearing?

12

MR. MERCER:

Well, if a petitioner or a

13

State prisoner was somehow precluded from developing

14

facts in the State court and should have had an

15

evidentiary hearing under this Court's clearly

16

established law, then that would be the correct

17

solution.

18
19
20

Here, however, we have a fully developed
State court record.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I understand that.

So

21

your -- your answer to Justice Souter would -- would not

22

be that -- that you can conduct a hearing if the State

23

should have conducted a hearing?

24

the State should have conducted a hearing is send it

25

back for the hearing.

What you should do if

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. MERCER:

That is correct.

The point

2

here under the ADPA -- and I think it is Congress's

3

clear intent -- is that all of these claims are to be

4

funneled through the State courts first.

5

has entrusted the State courts to be the primary and

6

first interpreters and enforcers of Federal

7

constitutional law for State prisoners' claims.

8

this Court has said many times, including in Sawyer v.

9

Smith, they're co-equals to the Federal courts in doing

10
11

And Congress

And as

so.
So what should have happened in this case we

12

contend is what the district court first did when

13

confronted with the claim in 2001.

14

assess the facts and claims as presented to the State

15

court and then decide whether it would be reasonable to

16

reject the claim under either prong of Strickland.

17

as this Court said in Strickland itself, the easiest and

18

most direct way to answer that question is through the

19

prejudice prong here.

20

And that is you

And

We have to remember the reality of this case

21

that for an affirmative defense of insanity, or NGI

22

under California law, Attorney Wager bore the burden of

23

proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his

24

client did not know the difference between right and

25

wrong when he committed this crime.

And every bit of Mirzayance's own deeds and

2

words show that he did.

Before the killing itself, he

3

closed the curtains and waited until he was alone with

4

the victim before entering her room with a gun in his

5

pocket and the silent weapon drawn.

6

silent weapon, delivering fatal blows, resorting to the

7

gun only when she screamed and struggled, and then

And then, further acknowledging both the

17

legal and moral wrongfulness of his actions, he turns

18

himself in to the police.

19

When they asked him how he felt about it, he said:

felt very guilty, very bad for what I've done.

21

why I turned myself in."

22

He says:

2

MR. MERCER:

All of this was in the State

trial transcript, so, yes, Justice Souter.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What -- what did they do?

4

Did they submit the trial transcript with the -- in -

5

with the response to the habeas petition at the State?

6

In other words, how did it get in front of the State

7

court, is all I want to know.

8
9
10

MR. MERCER:

It was a direct appeal to the

California Court of Appeals with a concurrently filed
habeas petition.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Ah, okay.

12

MR. MERCER:

13

So he was faced with that.

Yes, okay.
And then on the

14

flip side, there was not a shred of evidence that Mr.

15

Mirzayance ever thought that doing what he did was

16

legally or morally right.

17

extensive effort to cover his tracks and his own

18

admissions about the wrongfulness of his conduct, it was

19

not reasonably probable under Strickland for this jury

20

to believe that he somehow did not know.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So given all that, given the

How about getting another

22

jury?

That was -- one of the reasons that counsel gave

23

why he, counsel, was withdrawing the NGI plea was the

24

jury had just found -- rejected the second-degree murder

25

charge and found that he had acted deliberately with
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

premeditation.

2

had -- in the guilt phase, couldn't the attorney have

3

requested a brand new jury to hear the NGI plea?

4

But couldn't -- because the first jury

MR. MERCER:

Mr. Wager did not believe that

5

he had grounds to do so in this case.

And the district

6

court first addressed that opinion at the petition

7

appendix H in a footnote -- I believe it was footnote

8

21, but I don't have that in front of me right now -

9

where the district court talked about the standards for

10

getting a new jury and that under Penal Code, California

11

Penal Code 1026, you had to show some cause to the trial

12

court why this jury could not fairly address the claim.

13

Wager felt that he had no basis to do that at this time.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Mercer -- Mr. Mercer, I

15

guess we could resolve the case by saying if there was

16

any error it was harmless, but we didn't take the case

17

for that.

That wouldn't be very helpful to the bar,

18

would it?

I mean, I thought that the important issue

19

here is -- is the one you've been discussing, whether -

20

whether, in fact, you're bound to stick with the facts

21

that were -- were adjudicated by the State.

22

Well, I'm confident that, you

know, as this Court addressed in Strickland itself, the

claim fails for lack of -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if -- if the

7

Profitt -- the Fifth Circuit -- Profitt, the Fifth

8

Circuit case, applies in the Ninth, Ninth Circuit, and I

9

would think it would, just as the magistrate judge

10

thought that it would, then that would be -- present a

11

very close case and it would probably require reversal

12

of the State court, wouldn't you think, if the Profitt

13

rule applied?

14

nothing" -

What is it, the "all or" -- not "all or

15

MR. MERCER:

"Nothing to lose."

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. MERCER:

"Nothing to lose."

Well, if -- we agree that

18

nothing to lose, in fact, was what happened here, as in

19

Profitt.

20

recognized it, and I think you're right that this case

21

smacks of application of something like a "nothing to

22

lose" type rule.

23

but it surely has not been clearly established by this

24

Court in any decision, and that pre-AEDPA Profitt

25

decision from the Fifth Circuit certainly did not compel

The dissent recognized it, the District Court

And perhaps it's announced in Profitt,

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the California court or any other State court to apply a

2

"nothing to lose" rule on Strickland performance.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, isn't that -

4

the fundamental question is what level of generality you

5

look to determine what law has been clearly established?

6

Certainly Strickland is clearly established.

7

MR. MERCER:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Certainly.
But as far as I can

tell, the "nothing to lose" issue has not been addressed

10

by us and is not clearly established.

11

at it at the latter level of generality as opposed to

12

the former?

13

MR. MERCER:

So why do we look

Well, certainly this Court

14

could indeed take a more narrow view of what is clearly

15

established law.

16

the vast majority of ineffectiveness cases.

17

certainly, this Court has never squarely addressed such

18

an issue before, and certainly, this Court has never

19

announced that test to bind the States to resolve this

20

claim.

21

We agree that Strickland here covers
But

I think that the fallback position is,

22

absent a clear answer from this Court, as stated in Van

23

Patten, absent a clear answer, the State courts are left

24

with a very general Strickland principle, and as this

25

Court stated in Yarborough v. Alvarado, the more general
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the rule, the more leeway the States have in deciding

2

cases on a case-by-case basis.

3

So certainly we feel that Wager's decision

4

was patently reasonable under a traditional Strickland

5

analysis.

6

Now -

7

We're not asking for anything different.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think -- I

8

guess it's not open to us to issue a decision on the

9

"nothing to lose" question or we don't have to.

It's

10

the only -- the way we have to decide the case is to

11

determine whether the Ninth Circuit's determination on

12

the "nothing to lose" question was clearly established

13

by one of our cases.

14

MR. MERCER:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

15

Justice.

16

point, that the only dispositive question here that

17

really matters is where -- when the State court

18

adjudicates -

19

And I think this comes back to our original

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask you this

20

question.

Supposing we were convinced, and I'm not

21

suggesting we should be on the record, but supposing we

22

were convinced that only the dumbest, untrained lawyer

23

in the world could have failed to advance this defense,

24

and that therefore I would have no doubt about it as an

25

original proposition that he was incompetent under
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Strickland -- under the general Strickland standard.

2

Would we be permitted to say that in the case, or would

3

we have to say, well, this particular kind of attorney

4

error has never been addressed before, and therefore, we

5

can't look at it?

6

MR. MERCER:

Well, I think that because this

7

Court has never even addressed conduct anything like

8

this by an attorney -

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't it true that

10

there's a whole host of counsel errors that could

11

violate Strickland?

12

have addressed before before a Federal court can apply

13

and say Strickland was violated?

14

But do you have to find one that we

MR. MERCER:

I don't think you need one on

15

all fours, exact fact patterns.

16

unworkable.

17

clear answer to the question, and generally -

18

That would be

What you do need to do is give the courts a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would it be -- wouldn't it

19

be a clear answer in this case to say this was a

20

terrible lawyer, and therefore Strickland -- Strickland

21

applies?

22

lawyer was, Strickland -- we haven't adjudicated this

23

precise set of facts before, so that's the end of the

24

ball game?

25

Or could you say, we don't care how bad the

MR. MERCER:

This Court could say you

Alderson Reporting Company

2
3

JUSTICE STEVENS:
us to do?

4
5

Is that what you're asking

MR. MERCER:

We're not asking you to say

that a decision like this could never be unreasonable.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

MR. MERCER:

Oh, okay.

Okay?

We're asking that this

8

Court continue its Strickland jurisprudence that says

9

the Constitution makes one general requirement and, as

10

stated in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, that requirement is that

11

counsel make reasonable choices.

12

So certainly, there could be a situation

13

where counsel flipped a coin or made an arbitrary

14

decision or made an unreasonable decision -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why is it, then -- if we

16

say that and if Profitt is inconsistent with that, do we

17

then remand or do we say on this record clearly it was

18

reasonable?

19

take it?

20

Obviously you want us to do the latter, I

MR. MERCER:

Well, I don't frankly think

21

this case necessarily should be remanded back to the

22

Ninth Circuit.

23

I think that the writ needs to be denied under a

24

traditional Strickland analysis, and -

25

They've had it three times already.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Don't we have to go -

18
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't we have to say that this was reasonable?

2

MR. MERCER:

No.

I think what this Court

3

simply needs to say is that it was not objectively

4

unreasonable -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MR. MERCER:

7

come out the other way.

8
9

Of course.

-- for the California courts to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't understand

why you keep talking about Strickland.

We sent this

10

case back to the Ninth Circuit for further consideration

11

in light of Carey v. Musladin.

12

that the grant of relief was unreasonable because of the

13

lack of holdings from this Court regarding the

14

potentially prejudicial effect of spectators' courtroom

15

conduct of the kind involved here, which seems to me a

16

much narrower focus on the level of generality than

17

Strickland.

18

In that case we said

I would have thought you would have said -

19

maybe you are saying -- that because we don't have a

20

precedent from this Court rejecting the "nothing to

21

lose" case, that that should be the end of it.

22

MR. MERCER:

Well, I did not make such an

23

aggressive argument to this Court that a decision like

24

this could never be unreasonable, but certainly there is

25

no case from this Court that has announced such a
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

standard.

2

So JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

The issue is

3

not whether it's unreasonable or not.

4

whether it's an unreasonable application of -- of

5

clearly established Supreme Court law.

6

MR. MERCER:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The issue is

Yes, Your Honor.
Reasonableness or

8

unreasonableness is out of the question.

You -- you

9

first just have to look to Supreme Court law and say, is

10

it conceivably an unreasonable application of that.

11

the -- and the answer to that is we -- we haven't

12

decided the question of whether this is reasonable or

13

unreasonable, and therefore, it cannot possibly be an

14

unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

the one you've been making.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

That's his argument, not

That's right.

That seems

to me -

19
20

And

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You say the standard is

Strickland.

21

MR. MERCER:

Well, what I say is that this

22

Court has held that Strickland generally applies to

23

almost all ineffective counsel cases.

24

this Court has stated it applies in specific type issues

25

of conduct.

And certainly

Scalia is absolutely right, this Court has never said

anything remotely like the rule applied by the Ninth

JUSTICE BREYER:

But Justice

Well, they didn't.

7

what we're going to discover, I suspect, when we

8

actually dig into this record, which is pretty

9

extensive, are two things.

But

The first is the California

10

Court of Appeals does not seem to have dealt with the

11

particular issue in front of us.

12

due process issue at the end of their paragraph, they

13

have talked about things that are close to it, but they

14

nowhere say expressly how they are deciding the question

15

of whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel

16

for the reason that he didn't put on this insanity

17

defense.

18

They talked about a

That's going to be our first problem.
Then I looked to see, I got the record out

19

to see, if he raised it, and he didn't.

20

fact that they didn't talk about it, and then we have

21

the fact that of course the Supreme Court of California

22

says just one word, "Denied."

23

So we have the

Then when we discover round two in the Ninth

24

Circuit, we are going to discover some language which

25

says:

We are not relying on this rule, there is no such

rule, as a rule of you have to make a defense as a last

2

resort.

but has not explained its underlying reasoning or held

of the record to determine the State court's final

resolution of the case, whether it was reasonable or

Here's what they say.

Instead of that we say,

"Where the State court has provided an

unreasonable."

11

So they say:

We did conduct that record

12

independent review.

And our conclusion is that it was

13

unreasonable, okay?

Nothing to do with any special rule

14

here or anything.

15
16

We just think it was unreasonable.

All right; now, what are we supposed to do
with this?

17

MR. MERCER:

I think this Court needs to

18

give full deference to the adjudication of the State

19

courts.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is that deference

21

going to be?

I take it what it would be is that the

22

person, the defendant, would have in his petition -

23

which we don't actually have -- would have said the

24

facts are thus and so, and since they had no hearing,

25

they would have to take those facts as being thus and
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

so.

2

MR. MERCER:

Correct.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then we would have to

4

say, was it unreasonable of them on the facts as they

5

might have taken them most favorable to the defendant.

6

Is that what we're supposed to do?

7

of them to conclude for the State's favor in light of

8

reading these facts as most possible favorable for the

9

defendant?

Is it unreasonable

Is that what we should do?

10

MR. MERCER:

Correct, yes.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. MERCER:

Yes.

And that's the situation and

13

the circumstance outlined by the California Supreme

14

Court in People v. Duvall, and it's a case and a

15

procedure designed for judicial economy -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then we have to reach this

17

hearing issue because we have to say, insofar as the

18

hearing reached a different result, we should ignore it

19

for the reason that the statute tells us to consider the

20

reasonableness of the State court's decision in light of

21

the facts on the record before it.

22

MR. MERCER:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

Correct.
So we have to reach a huge

number of issues which we've never decided.
MR. MERCER:

That's why I raised it.

5

adjudication, a straightforward analysis under 2254(d)

of the California Supreme Court's legal resolution of

7

this claim.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We should treat the

district court proceeding as though it had never

10

happened on the ground that the Ninth Circuit never

11

should have remanded it to the district court, and we

12

just take it as though we had a 2254 petition from the

13

State supreme court in the district court.

14

district court doesn't conduct any hearing; it just

15

applies the standard.

16

clearly erroneous at the district court, that -- that

17

should be out of the case.

MR. MERCER:

And then the

21

point, I think your argument is as follows.

I'm not

I want you to tell me.

23

If the State court adjudication was -- was

24

contrary to what Justice Stevens' hypo suggested might

25

be the "total fool" rule, in other words no one but a
24
Alderson Reporting Company

1

complete nincompoop would have failed to -- to press

2

forward with this defense, then we can decide the case

3

simply under Strickland, because Strickland

4

unreasonableness is certainly going to cover the total

5

fool case.

6

But if we have something less egregious than

7

the total fool case, then we've got to look for more

8

precise Supreme Court precedent, and that's what gets us

9

into the Musladin or Musladin rule.

10

MR. MERCER:

Correct.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if we get to the

12

Musladin sort of level of generality, we do not have any

13

determination from this Court, any clearly established

14

law from this Court, that would indicate that the State

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES M. SEVILLA
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

3

MR. SEVILLA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to begin by addressing the

4

so-called "nothing to lose" rule, which is a fiction

5

attributed to Profitt v. Waldron, which -- it does not

6

say that in Profitt v. Waldron.

7

attributed to the Ninth Circuit, because the Ninth

8

Circuit not only did not say that; they rejected the

9

idea that they were relying on a "nothing to lose" rule.

10

The Ninth Circuit applied -- well, I might also add that

11

in a case called Lowery v. Lewis, which is cited at the

12

Petitioner's appendix for cert 94, the Ninth Circuit

13

specifically and in no uncertain terms said it rejected

14

a "nothing to lose" rule.

15
16

It's a fiction

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you reject it as

well, I take it -

17

MR. SEVILLA:

Yes.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS -- and concede it is

19

an improper -- it is not a basis for ineffective

20

assistance that somebody did not pursue a "nothing to

21

lose" case argument?

22

MR. SEVILLA:

It -- essentially, because

23

it's an irrelevant concern because the decision has to

24

be made on whether counsel's decision, as he faced the

25

trial facts, was objectively reasonable.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, in that calculus if there is nothing to

2

lose by going forward, if there is a great benefit to

3

achieve by going forward, if he's got a credible

4

defense, as it was determined by the district court at

5

the evidentiary hearing on insanity, then it's

6

objectively unreasonable on the morning of trial on the

7

way to court, to, out of a sense of despair or

8

hopelessness, subjectively speaking, to decide that:

9

I'm going to jettison this defense that's been prepared

10

over the year.

11

There was -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well I -- I don't

12

under -- I didn't follow that answer.

13

he does have nothing to lose, it is objectively

14

unreasonable for him not to go ahead with it?

15

MR. SEVILLA:

You're saying if

I'm saying that's one of the

16

factors.

I'm not saying that's the sole factor,

17

because, as the case that I cited, Lowery, there was a

18

motion to suppress which attorneys were making in this

19

case.

20

argued, well, there was nothing to lose in presenting

21

this motion to suppress, and the Ninth Circuit said:

22

That's not the rule; it's under the circumstances

23

whether the performance is objectively unreasonable, so

24

we need to take into consideration the compete -

25

competing factors.

They all lost, and his -- the client in that case

at this counsel's performance under Strickland, I guess,

3

and determine whether it was objectively unreasonable in

light of Strickland filtered through Yarborough?

And in -- in that

cannot be decided without an evidentiary hearing under

Strickland?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but you're saying -

the need for the evidentiary hearing, as I understand

it, was raised by you in the following way.

19

the California Supreme Court:

20

the papers filed here a violation of Strickland and a -

21

or a misapplication of Strickland in -- in the way the

22

California trial court came out; but if you do not find

a facial violation of Strickland based on these papers,

MR. SEVILLA:

Well, we argued that because

Mr. Wager, defense counsel, presented a declaration

reason he gave up this defense, we argued it was

objectively unreasonable if the court -- the State court

and Mr. Wager did not really address the reasons for

15

giving up the defense, he just said, I felt it was

hopeless.

It took the evidentiary hearing to determine

why he felt it was hopeless.

21

Petitioner's brief is wrong:

Now, that sounds like pretty thorough

investigation of the defense you say he should have

raised.

8

MR. SEVILLA:

Well, there are a couple of

problems with -- all of that is true.

I might quibble

with one, but what -- Mr. Wager was operating under a

11

fundamental misunderstanding of California law.

12

that was ready to go, to present.

14

testimony, childhood history, and these psychiatric

opinions of very formidable experts.

16

fundamental error that was only revealed at the

17

evidentiary hearing in the understanding of California

18

law.

19

evidentiary hearing -- he said that when a jury has

20

found the defendant has maturely and meaningfully

21

deliberated, that that means they found the equivalent

22

of wrongfulness.

2

that your friend began with, which shows his conscious

3

deliberation, his knowledge not only about how to go

about killing somebody, but also guilt, the recognition

5

of the wrongfulness of what he had done -- all that

6

under California law doesn't enter into a consideration

7

of insanity?

8
9

MR. SEVILLA:

Surely it enters into the

consideration, and every one of the experts considered

10

precisely that evidence, which was for the most part

11

after-the-fact evidence.

12

and, again, this came out at the evidentiary hearing

13

because it's certainly not discovered in the State

doctor's report that was submitted.

15

Dr. Anderson, stated at the trial in Federal court that,

16

yes, he was aware of the consciousness-of-guilt evidence

17

that came about mostly after the event, but that did not

18

speak to his intent, his mental state at the time of the

interesting fact to add to the calculus here, but he

absolutely denied there was any benefit.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, maybe -- maybe he

did, but when we come to judge prejudice, don't we have

to judge prejudice by considering exactly what Justice

Ginsburg just said?

In other words, our standard, the

prejudice is -- is an objective -- I mean the standard

that there is nothing to lose, that he is going to get

an automatic 25-year minimum sentence, that he is -- on

there is absolutely no benefit in giving up, and -- and

then he decides for reasons -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He made a

16

determination -- he made a determination after a

thorough investigation of the various points I went

18

through with you earlier that it was not a credible

unreasonable, but it doesn't seem to me to be -- under

MR. SEVILLA:

That's correct, because the

11

The -- the magistrate misapprehended the intention of

12

the circuit's first remand by thinking that it had

13

mandated a nothing-to-lose rule.

there was no need to make a finding.

But the circuit on -- on its second and

and deliberation as having mental-health concepts was

wrong because of the 1982 amendment to the statutes,

which removed many of the mental-health concepts and -

and put them over into the insanity phase.

he said to the court at the hearing, Mr. Mirzayance -

negation of any ability to win on a wrongfulness

MR. SEVILLA:

Not the last part by the way, not -- not

We won't find

And so they're using that as the basis to
say there was no prejudice, and now I guess that the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Ninth Circuit and the Federal courts would have to defer

2

to that finding on prejudice.

3

to that?

4

MR. SEVILLA:

Now, what's your response

Well, the California Court of

5

Appeals did not have before them the evidence that came

6

in by way of petition, which was all of the psychiatric

7

opinions of the forensic psychiatrists who gave

8

declarations saying that Mr. Mirzayance was insane at

9

the time of the homicide.

That is not within the court

10

of appeal opinion because the court of appeal opinion is

11

on the four corners of the record, and this was

12

collateral to that.

13

So any statement along those lines did not

14

encompass the most powerful evidence that was presented,

15

which would have been all of the psychiatric opinion

16

testimony about his mental state at the time of the

17

offense.

18

And then, of course, we know that at the

19

federal evidentiary hearing, this defense was found

20

credible, and one of the state doctors came over to the

21

defense side and testified that Mirzayance did not

22

understand wrongfulness at the time of the homicide

23

because of the psychosis.

24

error, and its clear from the record at the evidentiary

25

hearing, he had an error in his understanding of the NGI

And this doctor made an

Alderson Reporting Company

4

He thought if you met prong one you

But when he was asked by the State at this

wrongfulness, and the doctor said he didn't understand

wrongfulness.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Please correct me if I'm

wrong, but as a general rule psychiatrists don't -

10

don't testify as to the ultimate standard.

11

as to the condition and -- and the symptoms of -- of the

12

defendant, and then the jury makes that conclusion.

13

MR. SEVILLA:

They testify

In California in 1982, there

14

was a statutory amendment which prohibited forensic

15

experts from testifying to opinions at the guilt phase,

16

so that -- on legal issues like premeditation,

deliberation, so they could not, Dr. Satz could not

MR. SEVILLA:

Speaking to -- I think, Justice Kennedy, you

raised the issue about couldn't these -- in the

2

prejudice calculus, couldn't these psychiatrists have

3

been impeached with the fact that they found no

premeditation and deliberation?

5

statute under Penal Code section 28 prohibits their

6

opinion on premeditation and deliberation at the guilt

7

phase where the issue is premeditation and deliberation.

8

So, I can't understand how a court would let in their

9

opinions on premeditation and deliberation when there's

Well, California

10

a totally separate issue of insanity at the insanity

11

phase.

12

It's -- if it's irrelevant or prohibited at

13

the guilt phase, where premeditation is the issue, it's

14

surely going to be irrelevant at the NGI phase, where

15

it's not an issue, and we have a totally different

standard.

17

can be guilty of first degree murder and be insane.

18

That's -- that's clear.

As the courts of California have said, one

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN E. MERCER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MERCER:

Just a couple of points I would

9

like to make briefly to clarify a couple things.

10

First off, there was no finding that

11

Attorney Wager misunderstood California law or somehow

12

was under the impression that a finding of first degree

13

murder was legally precluded a finding of NGI.

14

argued at the State trial that there's no question that

15

an insane person can deliberate, and surely while the

16

jury's verdict was as devastating under the facts of

17

this case, he didn't close up his books and go home.

18

He

He told the trial judge, we need to reassess

19

this, I need to decide who I'm going to call, I need to

20

consult with my doctors and my co-counsel and decide

21

what we're going to do.

22

And as the district court found here, and as

23

Wager stated in the State court declaration, there was

24

no final decision made until the morning of trial when

25

the parents expressed a profound reluctance to assist
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

their son.

And this was, in fact, his first NGI

2

defense, but as Mirzayance's family attorney stated in

3

his State court declaration, Attorney Wager was a

4

ten-year expert on mental health and sanity issues with

5

the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.

6

tried more than a hundred trials.

7

He had done his homework here.

8

present.

9

with co-counsel, and concluded reasonably under his

He had

He was the expert.

He knew what he had to

He did not make a rash decision.

He consulted

10

professional valuation that the defense could not meet

11

its affirmative burden of proof here.

12

The second thing I would like to clarify on

13

Justice Ginsburg's point, there was some sentencing

14

discretion left here.

15

hindsight said, well, perhaps there was nothing to lose.

16

But he argued to the sentencing judge the very fact that

17

his client knew the wrongfulness of his actions and was

18

so remorseful should entitle him to a lesser sentence on

19

the weapons enhancement.

20
21
22

It's correct that Wager in

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What discretion did the

judge have?
MR. MERCER:

The -- that the -- the

23

sentencing judge could have imposed a high, middle or

24

low-term for the weapons enhancement.

25

sentence was 25 to life, my friend is correct, it's set
53
Alderson Reporting Company

2

enhancement, and he was convinced that Mirzayance was

3

remorseful, and gave him a mid-term instead of a

4

high-term, despite the fact.

5

But he had discretion on sentence

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there was also

6

something about the revocation?

7

revocations involved, I thought, two years on each.

8
9

MR. MERCER:

There were three

I don't believe that's correct.

I think it was a straightforward 25 years to life

10

sentence plus a weapons enhancement of four years added

11

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:

You keep saying 29 years.

Is it 29 years or is that just a misprint -

14

MR. MERCER:

15

is 25 -- excuse me.

17

murder, plus four years for the weapons enhancement in

18

this term, a mid-term, because Wager successfully argued

19

that his client was remorseful.

20
21
22

The aggregate sentence is 29 years

It's 25 years to life for the first degree

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What would he have

gotten in the high term?
MR. MERCER:

I believe that it was -- I

23

believe that it was six years as opposed to four.

24

may have been eight as opposed to four.
