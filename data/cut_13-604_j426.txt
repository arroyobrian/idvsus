 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Our first case this 

morning is Heien v. North Carolina. 

5

 Mr. Fisher. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8

 MR. FISHER: 

9

please the Court. 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 In a country dedicated to the rule of law, 

11

governmental officers should be presumed to know the law 

12

at least as well as the citizens are.  That being so, 

13

when questions about individualized suspicion arise 

14

under the Fourth Amendment, they should be addressed 

15

against the backdrop of the correct interpretation of 

16

the law, not simply any plausible reading an officer 

17

might have. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So suppose that this 

19

State, North Carolina, did have a goodfaith exception 

20

to the exclusionary rule.  What would you be arguing 

21

today? 

22

 MR. FISHER: 

We would be  still be 

23

arguing, if that were the case, that not only the Fourth 

24

Amendment was violated, but that the goodfaith 

25

exception didn't apply.  But you wouldn't have to reach

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that question in this case, and I  and I would concede 

2

to you, Justice Kennedy, that would be a debatable 

3

argument under this particular 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, why would it be any 

5

more debatable than the argument you're making here? 

6

I  I  I've more or less anticipated your  your 

7

your answer.  I think that has to be  I  I think you 

8

have to tell us even if the goodfaith exclusionary rule 

9

applies, a mistake of law just doesn't count. 

10

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, that's not exactly what 

11

this Court's jurisprudence holds, of course.  In Krull 

12

and Davis, the Court has held that reasonableness of 

13

mistakes of law can be taken into account at the remedy 

14

stage, and I think that would be 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Then  and then  but 

16

then that question is why isn't that a problem for you 

17

when you say there cannot be a reasonable mistake of 

18

law?  We know there can be. 

19

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, there's a difference, 

20

Justice Kennedy, between rights and remedies in the 

21

Court's jurisprudence.  When you ask the question about 

22

what is reasonable as to whether or not the Fourth 

23

Amendment was violated, both in its Fourth Amendment 

24

jurisprudence in criminal cases and in qualified 

25

immunity cases, you would do that assessment against the

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

correct interpretation of the law. 

2

 Now, in Leon 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, in connection 

4

we're talking about whether as a  as a categorical 

5

matter, as a jurisprudential matter, we can have this 

6

dichotomy known as a reasonable mistake of law, a 

7

difficult and interesting question.  But it seems to me 

8

that you have to make the same argument here or in 

9

in  in the case where they have a goodfaith 

10

exception, as you're making here, and that you have a 

11

problem with Davis and Krull.  And if you don't have 

12

a  if you have a problem with Davis and Krull, then 

13

that undermines your categorical argument. 

14

 MR. FISHER: 

No, I really don't think so, 

15

Justice Kennedy.  If  I think the best exposition of 

16

this problem in the course of jurisprudence is actually 

17

in the Anderson against Creighton case, the qualified 

18

immunity case, where the Court wrestled with this notion 

19

that how can something be reasonable in one sense and 

20

unreasonable in another. 

21

 And the answer the Court gave is that when 

22

we ask whether the Fourth Amendment was violated, we do 

23

not take mistakes of law into account, but the 

24

reasonableness of a mistake of law can go to the remedy 

25

question.  This is the premise from which Leon, Krull,

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and Davis all derive, which is that there was a Fourth 

2

Amendment 

3

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Would you just submit that 

the 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Fisher, I have a 

preliminary question. 
 Even if you  you're right about mistake of 

8

law, isn't it a moot question in this case because, as I 

9

understand it, the traffic stop ended with a warning 

10

citation.  So the traffic stop was over.  And at that 

11

point, the police officer asked if he can inspect the 

12

car, and the answer is yes.  Why isn't the consent to 

13

the search the end of this case? 

14

 MR. FISHER: 

Because it would be the fruit 

15

of the poisonous tree, Justice Ginsburg, if the stop was 

16

illegal.  There would have never been an opportunity to 

17

ask for consent.  And I think that's why the State and 

18

 Solicitor General haven't made any argument 

19

that the consent wipes away the Fourth Amendment 

20

question here. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, suppose the officer 

22

had said, all right, I'm giving you a warning.  You're 

23

free to leave now.  But by the way, may we  may I 

24

search your car? 

25

 MR. FISHER: 

I  I think that's more or

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

less what the officer did say here, Justice Alito. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And you would say then, even 

3

in that situation, that that would be the fruit of the 

4

poisonous tree? 

5

 MR. FISHER: 

Yes.  Because the stop wouldn't 

6

have taken place.  The  the Court's cases, Prouse and 

7

all the rest, say that a traffic stop is a seizure.  And 

8

so upon pulling Mr. Heien over, the officer needed to 

9

have reasonable suspicion to do so.  And the only 

10

argument for reasonable suspicion is the mistake of 

11

North Carolina law as to the brake light in this case. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I understood you to 

13

say earlier that you don't take  distinguishing the 

14

exclusionary rule in qualified immunity, you don't take 

15

reasonableness into account when it comes to a mistake 

16

of law? 

17

 MR. FISHER: 

What  what I  I'm sorry, 

18

Mr. Chief Justice.  What I  I think I said is that 

19

you  you don't take the reasonableness of mistake of 

20

law into account when you ask whether the Fourth 

21

Amendment was violated. 

22
23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but the Fourth 

Amendment 

24

 MR. FISHER: 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You do sometimes 

7

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm sorry, go ahead.

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

2

 You do sometimes when you ask about the 

3
4

Forgive me. 

remedy, and that's what he did. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But the  but the 

5

Fourth Amendment itself protects only against 

6

unreasonable searches and seizures by its term.  I don't 

7

understand.  It would seem to me that there's a stronger 

8

argument for taking the reasonableness of the officer's 

9

actions into account when you're talking about a mistake 

10

of law, because that's what the Fourth Amendment says, 

11

as opposed to remedies and qualified immunity. 

12

 MR. FISHER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, the Court 

13

rejected that precise argument in Anderson, that textual 

14

argument that the word "reasonableness" means that the 

15

Fourth Amendment incorporates mistakes of law, and 

16

because of a deep common law rule, which is that when we 

17

ask 

18
19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If I could just 

pause. 

20

 MR. FISHER: 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yeah. 
I thought we said 

22

exactly that in Herring, though, where we said that even 

23

though we're going to look at it in terms of remedy, 

24

that was not to say that the reasonableness didn't go to 

25

whether there was a substantive violation of the Fourth

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Amendment. 
 MR. FISHER: 

My understanding of Herring 

3

would be that would be a mistake of fact case, whether 

4

or not there was a warrant outstanding for 

5

Mr. Herant's  Mr. Herring's arrest would have been a 

6

factual question, not necessarily a legal question. 

7

 In Anderson and Krull and Leon  in Leon, 

8

Mr. Chief Justice, the Court said the officer in that 

9

case acted exactly as a reasonable officer could and 

10

should have acted.  And time and again in the Court's 

11

exclusionary rule cases, they've said the officer acted 

12

reasonably because at the reasonableness stage, you can 

13

take into account whether the officer reasonably 

14

misunderstood the law. 

15
16
17
18
19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, if you put 

aside 
 MR. FISHER: 

But at the right stage 

forgive me. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I was just saying, 

20

putting aside our discussion of Prouse and  and 

21

Herring, why does it make sense to say that you don't 

22

take reasonableness into account when the Fourth 

23

Amendment only protects against unreasonable searches 

24

and seizures? 

25

 MR. FISHER: 

I think for three reasons,

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mr. Chief Justice.  There's a practical reason, a 

2

theoretical reason, and a jurisprudential reason. 

3

 Now, I'll start with the theory because 

4

that's where I was just describing.  The deep common law 

5

heritage in this country that we have always followed, 

6

and the best exposition of that is in the Court's Cheek 

7

case, is that the criminal law is presumed to be 

8

definite and knowable. 

9

 So in all kinds of settings, whether it be 

10

punishing somebody for violating the law or any other 

11

actions citizens or the government engages in, we always 

12

assume a correct understanding of the law, even if it's 

13

later construed by a court in a way that wasn't exactly 

14

predictable or foreseeable. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Isn't it strange that you're 

16

citing Cheek for that proposition?  Didn't the Court 

17

hold in Cheek that under the  in that  in the 

18

circumstances there, ignorance of the law would be a 

19

defense? 

20

 MR. FISHER: 

Because of a special statutory 

21

exception that Congress had written.  The beginning of 

22

part two of Cheek is what I'm relying on, Justice Alito, 

23

where there is a paragraph or two that sets out with 

24

numerous citations this principle Justice Holmes 

25

described, and many others, that the criminal law is

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

presumed to be definite and knowable. 
 And once you take that presumption and put 

3

it into the police officer's mind, in this case or any 

4

other governmental actor who acts on a mistake of law, 

5

then there is no reasonable suspicion because we 

6

presumed them to have known the law when they acted. 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose the officer 

8

stopped the driver here and said, you know, I've been 

9

going to night law school and we don't know about this 

10

one light/two light thing.  There's an intermediate 

11

court of appeals that's hearing a case, it sounds like 

12

they're going so say only one light is necessary, but I 

13

don't know what the law is.  You better get this fixed. 

14
15
16
17

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I think there's two 

questions in there. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And then  and then he 

sees the contraband. 

18

 MR. FISHER: 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Pardon me? 
And  and then he sees 

20

the  in the course of this conversation, he sees the 

21

contraband. 

22

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I think there's two 

23

questions embedded in there.  One is whether the officer 

24

can look to court decisions or other third party sources 

25

to help him do his job.  Now, again, that is what the

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court has said in the Krull and Davis cases, that you 

2

take into account things like police manuals, court 

3

decisions, and the rest.  The Court has embraced that in 

4

its remedy jurisprudence, but in Whren has said that is 

5

off limits as to the Fourth Amendment. 

6

 Now, I think there's also an element of your 

7

question asking about what if  all that the officer 

8

was worried about was the safety on the roadway.  That 

9

would be a very different case.  Again, I'm going to 

10

turn the Court to Whren, where the Court said that if 

11

there's a stop done for reasons aside from probable 

12

cause, then the purpose of that stop, such as the 

13

community caretaking function, might kick in.  But of 

14

course the State hasn't made any argument in that 

15

respect in this case because the record is quite clear 

16

the officer was performing a criminal investigation. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But Mr. Fisher, we  we 

18

don't review opinions.  We review judgments, we review 

19

results.  What you're complaining about here is the 

20

admission of what was discovered in the search of the 

21

car, right? 

22

 Now, what difference does it make whether 

23

that was lawfully admitted because it was a 

24

constitutional search or it was lawfully admitted 

25

because the remedy of excluding it would not be applied

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if there was a mistake of law, a reasonable mistake of 

2

law? 

3

 I mean, the constitutional problem is the 

4

admission of this evidence.  And it seems to me whether 

5

it's properly admitted because the Fourth Amendment 

6

wasn't violated or whether it's properly admitted 

7

because the remedy for that violation is not  is not 

8

exclusion of the evidence, you lose either way, don't 

9

you? 

10

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, Justice Scalia, nobody 

11

has addressed the question of remedy in this case 

12

because nobody needs to address the goodfaith 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, we need to if we 

14

find, as you urge us to find, that it violates the 

15

Fourth Amendment to make the search.  We would then have 

16

to  in order to decide whether this judgment is 

17

lawful, we would have to decide whether the remedy of 

18

excluding that evidence has to be applied.  And you know 

19

the answer to that 

20

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, with  forgive me.  With 

21

respect, Justice Scalia, I'm not sure the Court needs to 

22

do that.  Of course, I think the Court can vacate and 

23

remand the judgment just as it does innumerable other 

24

times where it finds a problem with the lower court 

25

decision and therefore sends it back.  Even if this were

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purely a Federal case, Justice Scalia, I think I'd be 

2

saying the same thing, which is nobody has briefed or 

3

argued the goodfaith exception in this case.  So you 

4

would need 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you have.  I mean, 

6

you have and you acknowledge that it applies to 

7

remedies. 

8
9

 MR. FISHER: 

No.  No.  No.  Here's what I've 

acknowledged, Justice Scalia.  And I guess this is 

10

important.  We've acknowledged that the question of 

11

whether the mistake was reasonable would be relevant, if 

12

at all, at the remedy stage. 

13

 So what you would do is you'd ask the 

14

question, if this were a Federal case where you had to 

15

reach the question, you'd ask whether the officer's 

16

mistake of law in this case renders suppression 

17

inappropriate. 

18

 Now, I would  I would add that holding 

19

that it did render suppression inappropriate would be an 

20

extension of the Court's current goodfaith 

21

jurisprudence, which thus far has held that goodfaith 

22

doctrine applies only when an officer relies on binding 

23

law from a third  from a legislature or a court. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So the most you can get 

from us is a remand?

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

That's right.  But I do think 

2

it's just like any other 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Just let the North Carolina 

4

law  court decide whether  whether the remedy of 

5

exclusion should have been 

6

 MR. FISHER: 

That's right.  For example, 

7

Justice Scalia, I'm not sure it's any different if I 

8

said it was a constitutional violation that I may or may 

9

not be entitled to a remedy for under Chapman because 

10

the error was harmless or not.  Those are the kinds of 

11

situations where the Court would always resolve the 

12

constitutional question that the lower court addressed 

13

and then send it back down for the question of remedy. 

14

And that's all I 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't know why, 

16

following up on what Justice Scalia is saying, he's 

17

saying we don't give you a remedy unless we believe that 

18

one is warranted under the Fourth Amendment.  And since 

19

we apply  it doesn't matter what North Carolina 

20

applies, good faith or not  what we apply in terms of 

21

determining whether a Federal violation or a 

22

constitutional violation is subject to any type of 

23

remedy for you is the goodfaith exception.  So why do 

24

we have to remand?  I think that's  Justice Scalia's 

25

question and I'm not quite sure you've answered it.

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

The reason to remand is because 

2

the lower court hasn't addressed any question of remedy. 

3

And so in the first instance, you should send it back to 

4

the lower court for a full adversarial briefing subject 

5

to waiver and 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But North Carolina has a 

7

rule, I thought, that if you violate the Fourth 

8

Amendment, that's it.  We don't  we don't have a 

9

goodfaith exception. 

10

 MR. FISHER: 

That will be our position on 

11

remand, Justice Ginsburg.  But The State may try to 

12

persuade the Court of something else. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But isn't that  isn't 

14

that  isn't that what the North Carolina law is now? 

15

So it would be futile to send it back for them to answer 

16

the goodfaith exception since they have none. 

17

 MR. FISHER: 

It wouldn't be futile, Justice 

18

Ginsburg.  I think  I think the analogy that I gave 

19

earlier about Chapman is more or less on point.  The 

20

Court has held that if the Constitution is violated, 

21

that the defendant in a criminal case doesn't get a 

22

remedy unless he satisfies that test. 

23

 Now, all of the time in criminal cases you 

24

would just decide the constitutional issue and then send 

25

it back for remedy analysis if the lower court hadn't

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

addressed it. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's because  that's 

3

because they would be applying Federal law.  They would 

4

be answering the question that you want us to leave 

5

unanswered; namely, whether the Constitution requires 

6

that this evidence be  be stricken from the case. 

7

 MR. FISHER: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

Well, let me say 
But if indeed they're not 

going to ask that question when we send it back, it 

10

seems to me we have to answer that question here before 

11

we are able to reverse or affirm the North Carolina 

12

court.  It's a Federal question. 

13

 They are not going to  they are not going 

14

to get to that, but you're asking us to invalidate this 

15

conviction on the basis of Federal law.  And it seems to 

16

me we cannot do that unless there has  even if there 

17

has been a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the remedy 

18

must be exclusion of  of the evidence.  That's a 

19

Federal question.  I think we're going to have to decide 

20

it.  If we send it back to North Carolina, they're not 

21

going to decide it.  Are they? 

22

 MR. FISHER: 

No, I don't believe they would 

23

or should.  But I  but just if a State had adopted a 

24

rule saying we're going to have a more favorable 

25

jurisprudence of constitutional error and give automatic

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

new trials, the Court wouldn't be prohibited from 

2

deciding a constitutional issue and sending it back down 

3

to the State. 

4

 In the retroactivity sphere, Danforth v. 

5

Minnesota is another case where the Court has said that 

6

States can choose for themselves to have more favorable 

7

remedies and the Court simply deals with the Federal 

8

question. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, there's no question 

10

that if  if North Carolina applied a State 

11

constitutional analog to the Fourth Amendment, they 

12

could have a more extensive remedy than is recognized 

13

under our Fourth Amendment cases.  But your argument is 

14

they can adopt a State law rule for Fourth Amendment 

15

violations that is more protective of defendants than 

16

than Federal case law provides.  That would be your 

17

argument, right? 

18

 MR. FISHER: 

I don't need to make that 

19

argument.  I think that would be an interesting question 

20

and I think the State may be able to do that.  But what 

21

the Carter decision in North Carolina says is that 

22

violations of the State Constitution cannot be 

23

overlooked on goodfaith doctrine. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, was this decision 

based on the State constitution?

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

No.  It was based on the 

2

Federal Constitution, so we would send it back down. 

3

And we have preserved an argument that under State law, 

4

the violation of the Fourth Amendment also violates the 

5

North Carolina Constitution. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But you're asking us to 

7

reverse it on the basis of Federal law and you're asking 

8

us to send it back to a State court which is not going 

9

to  to inquire any further into Federal law, even 

10

though Federal law, arguably, you will concede says that 

11

even if there is a Fourth Amendment violation, if 

12

there's a goodfaith reasonable belief that the law was 

13

violated, the remedy of exclusion will not be imposed. 

14

 That's what the Constitution requires. 

And 

15

you're asking us to say, oh, no, there's  there's been 

16

a violation of the Constitution and we're going to 

17

reverse this judgment, even though we haven't inquired 

18

into whether the remedy that  that you want is 

19

required.  And it seems to me  I don't see how we can 

20

do that. 

21

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I don't want to keep 

22

saying the same thing.  I'll try and say it one more 

23

time.  I think it's fully customary for this Court to 

24

have a case from State courts where a State court issues 

25

a ruling on Federal law.  There may be many other issues

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in the case, Federal, State, whatever, but if the 

2

question of Federal law the State court decided is 

3

incorrect, this Court can reverse that judgment, say you 

4

got Federal law wrong, we're going to send it back down. 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But it  but it chooses 

6

to decide based on only half of the Federal law or 

7

threequarters of the Federal law.  Can North Carolina 

8

more or less set us up this way? 

9
10

 MR. FISHER: 

There is  there is a 

Federalism element 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

12

Justice Scalia's concern 

This is consistent with 

13

 MR. FISHER: 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15

Justice Scalia's question. 

16

Forgive me. 
 which is a followon to 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Yeah, they didn't get Federal 

17

law wrong.  Their opinion got Federal law wrong, but their 

18

judgment did not get Federal law wrong if indeed a good 

19

faith mistake of law does not require the exclusion of 

20

the evidence from the trial.  The judgment did not get 

21

Federal law wrong if that's the case. 

22

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I think that their 

23

analysis got Federal law wrong for the reasons we've 

24

described. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We don't review analyses. 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

We review judgments.  You're  you're urging that this

2

conviction has to be set aside.  That's what we're 

3

reviewing, the conviction, not the opinion. 

4

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, Justice Scalia, if you 

5

want to decide the goodfaith question that has not been 

6

briefed by any party, I  I suggest you might want to 

7

tread carefully. 

8

 Now, we've given you  maybe what I need to 

9

do at this point before I sit down and reserve my time 

10

for rebuttal, is explain to you why, even if you did 

11

feel like you needed to get to that question, which I 

12

don't think you need to, but if you did need to get to 

13

that question, why you should say that the goodfaith 

14

doctrine doesn't apply. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I don't want to take 

16

up your rebuttal time, but your argument this morning 

17

has confused me on something I thought I understood.  I 

18

thought that your  I thought the reason why you've 

19

argued this case the way you have, trying to convince us 

20

to draw a very sharp distinction between right and 

21

remedy is because you believe that North Carolina has 

22

the right under State law to devise its own version of 

23

the exclusionary rule.  If you're not  if that's not 

24

your argument, then I'm really puzzled by what you're 

25

doing. 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

Functionally, that's the way

2

things work in North Carolina, Justice Alito.  I think 

3

the only thing that  that maybe I need to make more 

4

clear is that the reason why it works that way in North 

5

Carolina is because the State has held that violations 

6

of our State constitution cannot be subject to a good 

7

faith exception.  The States have also held 

8
9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The State constitution is 

irrelevant because you're arguing about whether there is 

10

 whether there can be mistake of law in determining 

11

whether a search is reasonable under the Fourth 

12

Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 

13

Whatever we hold on that, North Carolina can do whatever 

14

it wants on the same question with respect to the State 

15

constitution. 

16

 MR. FISHER: 

That's the next thing I was 

17

going to say, is in theory you're right, Justice Alito, 

18

but what North Carolina has said is that we construe 

19

article 1, section 20, which is the State counterpart, 

20

to be coterminous with the Fourth Amendment.  So that's 

21

not the way the Court goes about its business.  So 

22

functionally in the State of North Carolina where you 

23

are is that Fourth Amendment questions run exactly 

24

parallel to State substantive constitutional law 

25

questions, and if there's a violation, you  you 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

suppress.
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr.  Mr. Fisher, suppose 

3

this were a Federal case and we had available to us, it 

4

had all been briefed, two alternative holdings in order 

5

to support the conviction.  And one holding was this is 

6

not a violation of Fourth Amendment law in the first 

7

instance, and the other holding was this is a violation 

8

of Fourth Amendment law, but the exclusionary rule 

9

operates and so the  the goodfaith exception to the 

10

exclusionary rule operates and so the evidence comes in. 

11

Is there any difference between those two holdings? 

12

 MR. FISHER: 

I think the difference between 

13

those two holdings, if the Court remanded, may well play 

14

out differently in North Carolina. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

16

it were a Federal case 

17
18

 MR. FISHER: 

No, no, no.  But I mean, if 

Oh, if it were.  I'm sorry, I 

missed that. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

20

 MR. FISHER: 

Is there any difference? 
If it were a Federal case, it 

21

would be functionally the same holding as to the outcome 

22

of that case.  But I think  if I could. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

24

 MR. FISHER: 

25

Yes, please. 
But there would be important 

reasons nonetheless, even though that would be a 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

functionally identical holding for the parties in the

2

case, there'd be very important reasons nonetheless to 

3

make sure that you render that holding as to remedy 

4

jurisprudence, not as to the Fourth Amendment itself. 

5

 And one reason is what I opened with and 

6

I've tried to say a couple times, that the government 

7

should be presumed to know the laws.  It would undercut 

8

public confidence in law enforcement and the common law 

9

rule upon which the criminal law is built to say the 

10

government doesn't have to be presumed to know the law 

11

when it acted. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, you say that, but some 

13

people say that the existence of a ruleremedy gap 

14

undermines public confidence in the law.  So why should 

15

we take that argument any more seriously than the 

16

than the ruleremedy gap problem in law? 

17

 MR. FISHER: 

Because that argument comes 

18

from academic literature and my argument comes from the 

19

Court's jurisprudence, where people have argued that you 

20

shouldn't suspend remedy and the Court has rejected and 

21

said, no, as Judge Wilkinson wrote in the law review 

22

piece that I cited in the brief, there's an important 

23

reason to announce the right even if you're not going to 

24

give a remedy. 

25

 Now, there are practical reasons for this as 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

well.  Even in the Court's goodfaith jurisprudence, the

2

Court has given leeway to officers only to the extent 

3

the officers are relying on a clear directive from a 

4

third party, like a legislature or a court.  This is 

5

very different.  This is like the Johnson case from 

6

1982, where the Court held that if the officer acts on 

7

his own view of a, quote, "unsettled" rule of law, that 

8

we not only find a Fourth Amendment violation, we 

9

suppress.  Even if I have to argue this case 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you dispute that this was 

a reasonable interpretation of State law? 
 MR. FISHER: 

I  I would dispute if you 

13

were asking in sort of a Chevron sense, that  that the 

14

statute was sufficiently ambiguous that it could have 

15

been read this way.  But I don't think it should be 

16

viewed as a reasonable mistake under the goodfaith 

17

doctrine, because the goodfaith doctrine deals with 

18

directives from third parties and officers relying on 

19

third parties.  Johnson that I was just citing to you 

20

says that unsettled questions of law 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I don't mean to  I 

22

don't mean to ask this in the context of any other body 

23

of the Court's case law, just in the common sense 

24

understanding of the term.  Was it reasonable if a 

25

even an attorney sat down and read the  the relevant 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

North Carolina statutes, do you think it would be

2

reasonable for that attorney to conclude that you have 

3

to have two functioning brake lights and not just one? 

4

 MR. FISHER: 

I think in the common sense 

5

way, I could concede that that would be reasonable.  But 

6

there's a legal way of asking what is reasonable and 

7

what is not, Justice Alito.  Let me say two things about 

8

that.  One is to just remind you that the Court has 

9

never taken into account ambiguity or  or the 

10

possibility for error in asking whether a governmental 

11

officer gets the law right. 

12

 And secondly, you have to define the concept 

13

of reasonable.  So even if you look at the facts of this 

14

case and you think, well, this mistake was reasonable, 

15

the other side hasn't given a definition of what it 

16

would say would be a reasonable mistake of law.  There's 

17

a reference to qualified immunity jurisprudence in the 

18

State's brief, and the Solicitor General describes 

19

uses language to say a foothold in the statutory text. 

20

 I'm not sure what definition actually would 

21

apply here, but one thing I do know from the Court's 

22

good  qualified immunity and EDPA jurisprudence, you'd 

23

have to define that concept, and the definitions that 

24

exist in the law right now are very, very broad.  And I 

25

think that goes to the practical reason that I was going 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to describe to the Court why you shouldn't hold that the

2

Fourth Amendment was satisfied here.  Because if you say 

3

that anything that's reasonable, as the Court has 

4

defined it in other cases, susceptible to debate, you 

5

vastly expand police officer discretion to conduct 

6

traffic stops. 

7

 As the Court has noted already, officers 

8

have enormous discretion both by the nature of the 

9

traffic laws and under the Whren decision.  If 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Fisher, let me  let 

11

me try my problem just one last time before your time. 

12

You  you assert that  that we  we should not 

13

decide the remedy question because it hasn't been 

14

argued.  But wasn't it your responsibility to argue it? 

15

You're asking us to set aside a judgment of the North 

16

North Carolina court.  That judgment can be set aside 

17

only if, number one, the Fourth Amendment was not 

18

violated or, number two, it was violated, but the remedy 

19

does not have to be exclusion of the evidence. 

20

 It's  it seems to me it's your burden to 

21

establish not just that the Fourth Amendment was 

22

violated, but also that  that exclusion was necessary 

23

under the Constitution.  And it is no answer to say, 

24

well, that hasn't been argued.  You haven't argued it. 

25

That's the problem. 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, if I need to argue it, I

2

would refer you to the part three arguments in our 

3

opening brief, which explain why even if you move good 

4

faith into the right  those  those would be my 

5

arguments, Justice Scalia. 

6

 The only other case that comes to mind is 

7

the Court's Ayolta case several years ago, where there 

8

was a takings question brought to the Court, and the 

9

Court divided that Federal law question into two pieces. 

10

And when the lower court had only addressed the first 

11

piece of the case, the Court reversed on that first 

12

piece of the case and sent it back down.  So I think 

13

what I'm asking for isn't terribly different. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Sent it back down for that 

15

court to decide the other piece.  But this Court will 

16

not decide the other piece, as you acknowledge. 

17

 MR. FISHER: 

If a State makes that choice 

18

that it's going to give a more favorable remedy, then 

19

federalism should respect that choice, Justice Scalia. 

20

22

 And so I'd like to reserve the rest of my 
time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. MONTGOMERY. 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

2

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 MR. MONTGOMERY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please 

3

 the Court: 

4

The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and 

5

 seizures, but it does not require that police officers 

6

 be perfect. 

7

 Amendment is reasonableness, all that is required is 

8

 that a police officer have a reasonable view of the 

9

Because the touchstone of the Fourth 

 facts and apply those facts to a reasonable 

10

 understanding of the law. 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

When will we ever get an 

12

understanding, the right understanding of the law? 

13

Meaning as I read the North Carolina Supreme Court 

14

decision, it still hasn't told me whether it's one or 

15

two brake lights, and the next police officer who wants 

16

to stop someone won't know that either. 

17
18
19

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

In North Carolina  excuse 

me. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, he may be bound by 

20

the appellate court decision, but that won't help 

21

clarify the state of the law. 

22

 Isn't what you're doing going to leave the 

23

criminal law unclear?  It's one thing to say that you 

24

want to not subject officers to civil liability.  It's 

25

another to say you want to leave the law unclear in a 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

criminal prosecution.
 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

Well, Your Honor in North 

3

Carolina, controlling precedent does come from the 

4

intermediate court of appeals.  That's not to say that 

5

our supreme court might not reach a different decision 

6

some day.  But for now, police officers would be bound 

7

by what the North Carolina court of appeals decided. 

8

 So the law has been decided. 

An officer who 

9

goes out and makes a stop tomorrow because one brake 

10

light is out would be acting unreasonably under that 

11

decision, so it doesn't leave criminal law uncertain. 

12

It 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, it will for the 

14

appellate decision if it's now taking your view that it 

15

can just find out whether the reading, the officer's 

16

reading of the law is reasonable.  It basically means 

17

that any open question, police officers will rule in 

18

favor of their right to search. 

19

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

It depends on whether the 

20

question is an open question and whether that 

21

interpretation by the officer is reasonable.  It 

22

certainly may be an unreasonable interpretation.  It 

23

would have 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Define what would make 

it unreasonable? 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

Well, it would be

2

unreasonable if there was plain language of the statute 

3

that no one could reach a different interpretation about 

4

at all if it was plain, or if there was a definite 

5

decision by an appellate court it would be unreasonable 

6

for officer to interpret it in his own way. 

7

 And the whole standard would be a reasonable 

8

person standard.  Would a reasonable person be able to 

9

take this view of the statute? 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's a very broad 

11

definition of reasonable.  I understand the idea that 

12

when, you know, 99 people out of a hundred think you 

13

have to have two brake lights, like you do everywhere 

14

else in the country, that it's reasonable for the police 

15

officer to think that. 

16

 But it sounds to me like you're adopting the 

17

same standard that we apply in qualified immunity, which 

18

gives the officers quite  quite broad scope, and 

19

that  that's troubling. 

20

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

It's not  it's not the 

21

same as qualified immunity in that qualified immunity 

22

looks also  it looks  it protects the plainly 

23

incompetent.  We're not saying that is the standard 

24

here, that 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, I think it doesn't 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

protect the 
 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

I'm sorry.  It doesn't 

protect the plainly incompetent. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  So I think what the 

5

Chief Justice is asking you is to describe a case for us 

6

where the officer would receive qualified immunity but 

7

it would not count as reasonable for these purposes. 

8

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

One of the things that this 

9

Court has said in Wilson v. Layne is that this Court and 

10

courts can look beyond just the officer's interpretation 

11

like this.  It can look to other matters.  There could 

12

be an officer who  who had an unreasonable 

13

interpretation of the statute, and yet he may still have 

14

qualified immunity, for instance, because he was told by 

15

a judge or by the attorney general or by someone that 

16

this was correct, and that was a complete 

17

misunderstanding of the statute. 

18

 It may be that that officer would still be 

19

protected by qualified immunity, but for the  for 

20

Fourth Amendment purposes, that would not be a 

21

reasonable interpretation of the statute. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You would not give a 

23

pass  I mean, let's say the case is flipped here and 

24

the most reasonable reading of the statute is that you 

25

only need one brake light. 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And so someone's driving around with one

2

brake light.  You pull him over.  He's going to say:  I 

3

reasonably thought that, you know, I  I only  I only 

4

needed one.  And the Court comes out and says, I needed 

5

two. 

6
7
8
9

 In that case, ignorance of the law would not 
save him, would it? 
 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

No, it would not.  But the 

flip side of that is that an officer's belief that you 

10

needed all of your brake lights, and that is not 

11

actually the law, does not mean that that person is 

12

guilty. 

13

 In other words, in this instance, this 

14

this driver  excuse me, the defendant here or driver, 

15

actually, could not be held liable for the brake light 

16

violation.  So it's not that the fact that an officer 

17

thinks reasonably that the law is something.  That 

18

doesn't make it the law, just like if a citizen does not 

19

think that's the law, that does not mean that he can 

20

escape liability. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There is a problem, 

22

however  I'm sorry.  The police officer wasn't 

23

stopping him because of the brake light.  The police 

24

officer was involved in criminal interdictions and 

25

admitted that this was a pretext, a lawful pretext, he 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thought.

2

 So he wasn't there just to tell him  if he 

3

had just stopped him and said, you know, fix your brake 

4

light, and drove away, there would never be a lawsuit, 

5

correct? 

6

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's correct. 
So how many citizens 

8

have been stopped for one brake light who are asked to 

9

have their car searched?  And is that something that we 

10
11

as a society should be encouraging? 
 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

Well, there  wholly 

12

innocent people are stopped quite often because of 

13

mistakes of fact, for instance.  That's part of the 

14

whole Terry  how Terry works and those types of brief 

15

stops.  There turns out times that citizens have not 

16

committed any kind of offense, and yet they are stopped. 

17

 This is just another example of that, in 

18

which an officer acted reasonably, just as with a 

19

reasonable mistake of fact, and it turned out that this 

20

was not actually a violation. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'd like to focus 

22

again on your definition of reasonableness.  Let's say 

23

you have two court of appeals decisions.  One says you 

24

need two brake lights; the other says you need one. 

25

 Is it reasonable for the officer to pull 

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

somebody over when one of their two brake lights is

2

burned out? 

3

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

If you have conflicting 

4

rulings from the court of appeals, it would be 

5

reasonable then for the officer to decide which he 

6

thought was the better rule, if there were two different 

7

decisions from the court of appeals, which is not 

8

supposed to happen in our system. 

9

 But if that did happen, then it would be 

10

reasonable for the officer to rely on either one of 

11

those. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Montgomery, I take it 

13

that one of Mr. Fisher's arguments, maybe his primary 

14

argument, is that this just looks like a remedies 

15

question, it does not look like a rights question, it 

16

focuses on the culpability of the officer in the way we 

17

do when we think about immunity or when we think about 

18

the exclusionary rule. 

19

 So why isn't that exactly right, that to the 

20

extent that this conviction ought to be upheld, it ought 

21

to be upheld on remedies reasons rather than rights 

22

reasons to fit in with our basic understanding of what 

23

remedies and rights do and do differently in our law? 

24
25

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

Well, certainly this court 

looks at different things when it looks at the right 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

versus the remedy.  Reasonableness is important in the

2

rights stage.  In the remedies stage, that may be 

3

considered, but also the culpability of  of the 

4

officer, whether he was deliberately disregarding the 

5

law, those types of things. 

6

 This Court has addressed mistakes of law 

7

both in the rights and the remedy stage.  And so it 

8

would be important to address it in the rights stage 

9

here in this particular case because then we don't get 

10

into the sorts of things that wouldn't be necessary in 

11

the remedy stage, if that answers your question. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What about  what about 

13

the dissenter in the North Carolina court of appeals who 

14

said North Carolina has no goodfaith exception, and so 

15

all that this decision does is it allows the police to 

16

get around the absence of a goodfaith exception? 

17

 Wasn't that the position of the dissenter, 

18

that allowing for a reasonable mistake of law to support 

19

a warrantless stop is the functional equivalent of a 

20

goodfaith exception? 

21

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

That was the position of 

22

the dissenting justices at the North Carolina Supreme 

23

Court, one of the things that they said. 

24

 But again, this again gets back to 

25

reasonableness as the standard for the Fourth Amendment. 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And that is what this Court has said is important at

2

that stage, is whether an officer is acting reasonably. 

3

 There are other considerations that take 

4

place at the remedy stage.  So the State was asking for 

5

nothing more than simply whether this violated the 

6

Fourth Amendment, and not about remedy.  And 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Counsel, maybe you have the 

8

answer to all the questions I was asking of  of 

9

Mr. Fisher.  And  and I guess the answer is you 

10

haven't argued that point, right? 

11

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

The remedy? 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You did not  you did not 

13

assert in your  in your brief or you haven't asserted 

14

it in oral argument, thus far, anyway, that even if it 

15

did constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the 

16

remedy did not have to be exclusion of the evidence, and 

17

that remedy is indeed subject to reasonable mistake of 

18

law, and therefore, the decision has to be affirmed. 

19

 But you didn't make that argument. 

You want 

20

to put all your eggs in the basket of whether it's a 

21

violation of Fourth Amendment.  Am I right about this? 

22

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  I'm sorry to waste 

24
25

so much of our time. 
 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

Well, we did not make that 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argument below in the North Carolina Supreme Court.  And

2

Mr. Fisher is correct in that it is our State 

3

constitution that says that there's no goodfaith 

4

exception. 

5

 If a defendant had only raised a Fourth 

6

Amendment question in our courts, the goodfaith 

7

exception would still be available if that defendant did 

8

not make a claim under the State constitution. 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I'm not so sure it 

10

makes good prudential sense to allow the North Carolina 

11

Supreme Court to put to us what is basically an abstract 

12

question. 

13

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The question of 
To  to give an answer 

15

without reference to the fact that, as Justice Scalia 

16

indicates, part of the Fourth Amendment is the 

17

goodfaith exception.  It bears on reasonableness. 

18

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

That's correct.  And  and 

19

this  this Court has, in cases like Rodriguez dealt 

20

with mistake of law just in the rights stage rather than 

21

the remedies stage, and that's all that it  has been 

22

briefed in this instance.  That's correct. 

23

 And one of the things that is different 

24

about this from Krull and Davis is that we're not 

25

talking about 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  I mean, that

2

just doesn't wash.  Yes, in other cases we just decide 

3

the  the right and  and don't have to decide the 

4

remedy, but this is a case in which, unless  unless 

5

the remedy is exclusion, there's no basis for us to set 

6

aside the judgment of the North Carolina Supreme Court. 

7

Unless  unless the remedy is exclusion.  It seems to 

8

me that's part of the case to reverse.  If  if we 

9

can't say that, we have no business reversing.  But if 

10
11

it hasn't been argued, I guess we can do that.  I guess. 
 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

That  that has not been 

12

argued here or below, that's correct.  A difference 

13

between this case and Krull and Davis is that this case 

14

 does not  this involves a mistake of law as to a 

15

substantive statute rather than a mistake of law as to 

16

the Fourth Amendment itself.  And the difference in that 

17

is that a reasonable violation of the Fourth Amendment 

18

is still a violation of the Fourth Amendment. 

19

 There  if there's a statute that gives an 

20

officer the opportunity to make a seizure on less than 

21

what is required by the Constitution, less than probable 

22

cause or less than reasonable suspicion, even if the 

23

officer is reasonable, that is still a Fourth Amendment 

24

violation, which is why this Court would have to go to 

25

the remedy portion to decide whether the exclusionary 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

rule applied.
 In this instance, this case, it was a 

3

mistake as to a substantive statute that was used by the 

4

officer to  as part of the facts and circumstances of 

5

this case.  As part of the totality of the circumstances 

6

of this case, the officer considered what he thought was 

7

the correct law. 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why does it  why should 

you draw the line between if he gets the Fourth 

10

Amendment wrong, the Fourth Amendment is violated, but 

11

if he gets the statute wrong, then the Fourth Amendment 

12

is not violated? 

13

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

Because the officer only 

14

needs to act reasonably and the fact that he gets the 

15

statute wrong does not mean that he acted necessarily 

16

unreasonably. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, the fact that he 

18

made a mistake about what the Fourth Amendment requires 

19

could also be reasonable. 

20

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

It could be, and that would 

21

be proper to consider, as this Court has, in the 

22

remedies stage rather than in the rights stage.  In the 

23

DeFillippo case  that this Court decided, there was a 

24

situation in which a statute, a substantive statute was 

25

found unconstitutional and void for vagueness, and yet 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this Court found that there was probable cause in that

2

case for the officer to make an arrest based upon that 

3

statute. 

4

 So that was one case in which this Court 

5

looked at it at the rights stage as a mistake of law 

6

rather than at the remedy stage. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, do you think if 

8

DeFillippo came up again today, with all the cases that 

9

have been decided since then, that we would decide it 

10

the same way or do you think we would conceptualize it 

11

now as a remedies question? 

12

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

I think the Court would 

13

decide it the same way.  And this Court in Arizona v. 

14

Evans said that if the case is even decided before the 

15

goodfaith exception are still viable in terms of the 

16

Fourth Amendment analysis. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What kind of mistake of 

18

law did the police officer make in DeFillippo?  The law 

19

said exactly what he thought it said. 

20

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22

as a mistake of law question? 

23

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

That's correct, Your Honor. 
Why do you classify this 

I believe the 
We said it was 

presumptively valid and he acted according to a statute. 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3
4
5
6

That's correct.
You don't ask police 

officers to ignore the law. 
 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

That is correct that it's 

different from this case, but there was still 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, no, no.  This is a 

7

mistake of law; he wasn't following the law, presumably, 

8

according to the appellate decision. 

9

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

That's right.  The 

10

DeFillippo case is important because you had someone who 

11

was acting wholly innocently; he was not committing an 

12

offense at all, as  as in this case you had someone 

13

who was acting wholly innocently and was not committing 

14

a violation of the law.  So in DeFillippo, this Court 

15

said that even though the conduct was wholly innocent, 

16

there still was probable cause despite the mistake of 

17

law, and that's all that we're saying in this case. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Isn't there another 

19

difference between DeFillippo and this case?  The court 

20

in DeFillippo talks a lot about how there's a 

21

presumption of constitutionality for any statute and we 

22

don't want officers to go around questioning the 

23

constitutionality of statutes.  But here, that's not the 

24

case.  Here, there's a statute and an officer is not 

25

supposed to read it as broadly as possible.  An officer 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is supposed to read it fairly.

2

 So there's no presumption that goes into 

3

effect and there's no  there's no way in which we 

4

could say the same thing about DeFillippo, is that we 

5

don't want officers to question  to inquire into this 

6

area. 

7

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

It is different, but we do 

8

want officers to enforce the law.  We don't want them to 

9

just sit back and not enforce 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

We want them to enforce the 

11

law fairly and as written and  and not to push every 

12

statute to its  you know, to the furthest, furthest, 

13

furthest it could go without being found, you know, 

14

utterly unreasonable. 

15

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

16

But we do want them to act reasonably and still enforce 

17

the law, not to turn a blind eye to what may be a 

18

violation. 

19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

read here?  What are the exact words from the statute. 

21
22

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

25

The statute has two parts. 

It has a subsection (d). 

23
24

How  how does the statute 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Where  where do we find 

it? 
 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

This would be in the 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appendix to the Respondent's brief, appendix pages 1 

2

appendix pages 1 through  actually through 5, has all 

3

of the relevant portions of the statute. 

4

 Subsection (d) involves rear lamps and says 

5

that, "every motor vehicle shall have all originally 

6

equipped rear lamps or the equivalent in good working 

7

order."  That's the relevant portion of subsection (d). 

8

Subsection (g), which is on page 3 of the appendix says, 

9

"No person shall sell or operate on the highways of the 

10

State any motor vehicle manufactured after December 

11

31st, 1955 unless it shall be equipped with a stop lamp 

12

on the rear of the vehicle."  That is the language that 

13

the North Carolina Court of Appeals said when it said "a 

14

stop lamp," that meant that only one was required. 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That  that seems to be 

what it says. 
 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

The confusion comes in 

18

the confusion comes in, Justice Scalia, in the last 

19

sentence of subsection (g) on appendix page 3, which 

20

says, "The stop lamp may be incorporated into a unit 

21

with one or more other rear lamps."  Where the confusion 

22

comes in is that sentence would seem to imply that the 

23

stop lamp is a rear lamp, that it can be incorporated 

24

into a unit with one or more other rear lamps. 

25

 And if you go back to subsection (d), that's 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the section that says that "all originally equipped rear

2

lamps must be in good working order."  So there 

3

there's some conflicts in 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I mean, that applies 

5

to all rear lamps, the stop lamp and all the other 

6

lamps. 

7

 MR. MONTGOMERY: 

8

other lamps we know 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's correct.  All the 

So  so it has to be 

10

plural.  If it's going to apply to the stop lamp and all 

11

the other lamps, of course, it would say lamps.

Thank you, counsel. 

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

 MS. KOVNER: 

19

please the Court: 

20

Thank you. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Since the founding, the probable cause 

21

standard had allowed  has allowed police officers to 

22

make stops when there are reasonable grounds to believe 

23

that a person committed a crime even if the officer 

24

later turns out to have been mistaken about either the 

25

facts or the law.  And as Justice Kennedy observed at 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the start of this argument, given that this Court's

2

cases recognize that there can be a reasonable mistake 

3

of law, an officer who makes a reasonable mistake of law 

4

may have a reasonable grounds to believe that a person 

5

committed a crime. 

6

 If I can go to a question that Justice Kagan 

7

asked about why this question is more appropriately 

8

addressed at the rights stage than the remedies stage, 

9

we think there are three main reasons.  The first has to 

10

do with history.  Since the founding, this Court has 

11

treated the probable cause standard as allowing for 

12

reasonable mistakes of law. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Are all the cases that 

14

you cite, including Riddle, all in the context of a 

15

customs statute that didn't permit customs officers to 

16

suffer damages 

17

 MS. KOVNER: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

19

error of law, correct? 

20

 MS. KOVNER: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22
23

 for purposes of an 

That's correct.  The reason 
None of those cases 

involved a violation of the Fourth Amendment. 
 MS. KOVNER: 

That's correct.  The reason 

24

those cases are relevant here is because those cases are 

25

interpretations of the probable cause standard. 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But how is that

2

different in terms of its analysis, those cases, from 

3

what we've ultimately applied as a qualified immunity 

4

standard with respect to civil damages today? 

5

 MS. KOVNER: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7
8
9

So 
Doesn't it follow 

don't they follow exactly the same reason? 
 MS. KOVNER: 

I don't think so, Your Honor. 

Those cases, the probable cause reasoning that the Court 

10

has followed in those cases is what the Court has done 

11

at the merits stage of the Fourth Amendment analysis. 

12

So this Court has routinely cited cases under those 

13

customs statutes as illuminating the meaning of the 

14

probable cause standard, and is therefore illuminating 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So you disagree with 

16

Justice Story when he looked at those cases and made the 

17

point I just made. 

18

 MS. KOVNER: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20
21

No 
Do you think he was 

wrong? 
 MS. KOVNER: 

There's no doubt that in those 

22

cases the question, the question the court was 

23

ultimately answering is, are those customs officers 

24

liable.  But the way that it was answering that question 

25

was by determining whether those officers had probable 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cause.  And probable cause is the constitutional

2

standard.  And that's why this Court has subsequently 

3

relied on those cases in illuminating the 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can I ask you a question? 

5

I'd just like you to address for a minute  assume for 

6

the sake of argument that I agree with you that a 

7

reasonable mistake of law that I  is an excuse.  But 

8

what is a reasonable mistake? 

9

 Now, that's what I'd like you to address. 

10

And in particular, would you have objection to:  It has 

11

to be, one, exceedingly rare; two, objective; three, it 

12

is  has to be that a reasonable lawyer would think 

13

that the policeman was right on the law, and only if 

14

after, to quote you brief, a careful scrutiny and 

15

serious difficulty in construing the law, does it turn 

16

out that he is wrong. 

17
18
19
20
21

 Now, what do you think about that or some 
other standard? 
 MS. KOVNER: 

I think we agree with each of 

those descriptions of a reasonable 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  If you agree 

22

with those then what about this case?  Because after 

23

all, it does say a stamp light  a stop light.  What's 

24

the difficulty of construing that to mean a stop light? 

25

 MS. KOVNER: 

So we think that the North 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Carolina Supreme Court and the court of appeals were

2

right that an officer could reasonably interpret the 

3

statute to require 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Only after a careful 

5

scrutiny and serious difficulty in construing the law 

6

does it turn out that the officer was wrong.  What's the 

7

difficulty? 

8

 MS. KOVNER: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10
11

Here 
It stays a stamp  a stop 

light. 
 MS. KOVNER: 

Here, the difficulty is in the 

12

other provision, which requires all originally equipped 

13

rear lamps to be working.  And 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But that includes the stop 

15

light and any other lights.  Okay.  A stop light, the 

16

turn lights, the backup lights. 

17
18
19

 So you had to use the plural for those other 
provisions. 
 MS. KOVNER: 

Agreed.  It's not the plural. 

20

It's the fact that all originally equipped rear lamps 

21

need to be working, which means that if a car was 

22

originally equipped with multiple stop lamps, as cars 

23

now are, then when one of them is broken, one of the 

24

originally equipped rear lamps is not working. 

25

 So that's the difficulty. 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

And that's why 

Official

1

none of the courts that considered this question thought

2

this was anything other than a very hard question of 

3

statutory interpretation. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So where do you come 

5

out in my hypothetical of the two court of appeals 

6

decisions?  Is that reasonable for the officer to say, 

7

"Well, I'm going to pick this one and follow that?" 

8
9

 MS. KOVNER: 

So if the officer is in a 

jurisdiction whose court of appeals has decided the 

10

question, we think the officer is bound by that 

11

interpretation, even if other courts of appeals come out 

12

differently.  But if the officer is in a jurisdiction 

13

where the question is undecided and different courts 

14

have come out differently in other jurisdictions, then 

15

we don't think the fact that one court has decided it in 

16

one way is dispositive.  We think then the court looks 

17

to this question of is it a really difficult 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, now I forgot one 

19

thing, which may be obvious to me.  We're not talking 

20

about a difficulty in construing the Fourth Amendment 

21

itself?  We're talking only about a difficulty in 

22

construing a criminal statute, where, in fact, the 

23

reason for the stop or seizure is based on a violation 

24

of criminal law. 

25

 MS. KOVNER: 

That's right.  I think the 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

probable cause standard allows for an officer to act

2

when he has reasonable grounds to 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How is your standard 

4

differed from qualified immunity standard of 

5

reasonableness? 

6

 MS. KOVNER: 

Sure.  We think that an 

7

officer, in order to have reasonable grounds for a stop, 

8

needs to be able to point to something in the statute 

9

that affirmatively supports his view, whereas the 

10

qualified immunity standard seems to require essentially 

11

the opposite.  It seems to require that there's a 

12

precedent that forecloses what the officer does in order 

13

to protect only those who were acting  to protect 

14

everybody except for those who are clearly incompetent. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The one argument that is 

16

in your brief that I didn't follow is that the 

17

importance of holding the way you recommend is so that 

18

when you get this question solved, you tee up the 

19

question, what is the rule, one light or two lights. 

20

 But yet in this case, it was consent. 

The 

21

evidence that came in had nothing at all to do with the 

22

traffic violation, so we wouldn't need to  the Court 

23

wouldn't need to decide the traffic violation, say  it 

24

was consent.  I think the North Carolina Immediate 

25

Appellate Court said it was a legitimate consent.  It 

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was consent, and this evidence comes in, and we never

2

had to deal with what the traffic regulation was. 

3

 MS. KOVNER: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

4

And this question comes up in two contexts.  Sometimes 

5

it would be litigated in the suppression context, and 

6

sometimes it would be litigated because the officer 

7

actually issues a citation.  And our concern expressed 

8

in that portion of the brief is that if the Court takes 

9

the position that whenever an officer is wrong about the 

10

law, he has violated the Fourth Amendment, it's going to 

11

deter officers from making stops where there are 

12

arguments on both sides. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you  do you agree 

14

that if there is an illegal stop, that this consent is 

15

the fruit of the poison tree? 

16

 MS. KOVNER: 

We think that would be a 

17

difficult question.  We don't necessarily agree with 

18

that.  This Court has said it's not simply a butfor 

19

test.  So even if the stop was a butfor cause, that 

20

doesn't necessarily mean that the evidence was fruit of 

21

the poisonous tree.  But the question wasn't argued 

22

below by the State and it hasn't been briefed here.  So 

23

we've addressed simply the question of 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Kovner, you started your 

argument by saying you were going to give us three 

52

Alderson Reporting Company

reasons why this should be a rights question rather than

2

a remedies question.  You said history, which frankly, 

3

you know, I think your history probably doesn't say as 

4

much as you think it says.  So I want to know what is 

5

number two and number three are. 

6

 MS. KOVNER: 

Sure.  The second is an 

7

administrability reason.  We think that this is the 

8

simplest standard.  You simply ask officers to decide 

9

whether  you simply ask courts to decide whether an 

10

officer could reasonably think that a person had 

11

committed a crime, and you don't separate was this a 

12

question of law or a question of fact and treat one in 

13

the rights section and one in the remedies section. 

14

 And the third is that we don't think there's 

15

a normative reason to treat mistakes of law and mistakes 

16

of fact differently.  When an officer makes a stop in 

17

this situation, he can just as reasonably be confused as 

18

to what the  the law is under these statutes, as 

19

confused as to what the facts are.  And if we're going 

20

to treat mistakes of fact as part of the rights 

21

analysis, it makes sense to treat reasonable mistakes of 

22

law in the same way.

 If the Court has no further questions, thank 
you.

 Mr. Fisher, you have three minutes left.
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. FISHER: 

Thank you.  I'd like to make 

5

four points if I could.  To start with the 

6

administrability question of what would reasonableness 

7

mean, Mr. Chief Justice, I think your hypothetical of 

8

two differing court of appeals opinions in a State, 

9

I think under the analysis that I just described, would 

10

mean that it would violate the Fourth Amendment and half 

11

the State to conduct the stop and not in the other half 

12

of the State, because each would be binding in its own 

13

component of the State. 

14

And that shows why in Whren, and many other cases, this 

15

Court has rejected that kind of analysis at the rights 

16

stage and cabined it only to the remedies stage.  If you 

17

want to ask 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, in this  in this 

19

case, didn't the dissenters in the North Carolina 

20

Supreme Court say that the interpretation adopted by the 

21

court of appeals was surprising?  So all we would have 

22

to say on reasonableness is that if it's not  if it's 

23

surprising, if the correct interpretation is surprising, 

24

then the contrary interpretation is reasonable.  Would 

25

we have to go further than that? 

54

 MR. FISHER: 

I think you do because you have

2

to just give a little more teeth to it.  What the 

3

Solicitor General said is that it would have to have 

4

foothold in the statute.  And I think that's more or 

5

less what was recited today,there was a recent D.C. Court 

6

of Appeals opinion that holds that a police officer 

7

could  could argue from a foothold in the statute that 

8

all license plate frames are illegal. 

9

 Now, they rejected that under their code, 

10

but it's just one of innumerable arguments that a law 

11

enforcement officer might make and that this 

12

reasonableness test would give grave 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no.  I mean, it would 

14

be one way, one way.  One court one way, one way the 

15

other way.  The officer loses because, you know, it ties 

16

 it has to be unusual.  It has to be  you heard 

17

what 

18

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I think, Justice Breyer, 

19

the problem with that is that it's the core presumption 

20

that the officer needs to understand the law as it 

21

existed, as it was later construed. 

22

 And Mr. Chief Justice, you asked, I think, 

23

about the ignorance canon.  The State's response was, 

24

well, if somebody is reasonably mistaken about the law, 

25

we would convict him. 

55

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 And the reason why is because we would

2

assume he knew the law.  We would assume that somebody 

3

at the court of appeals split and this Court divided 

4

54, the person is still convicted because we assume 

5

they knew the law when they acted. 

6

 And all we are asking for today is for the 

7

exact same assumption to apply to police officers.  And 

8

with due respect to the Solicitor General, the founding 

9

 the cases they describe don't help them.  They're 

10

only remedy cases, and they reinforce our point.  And 

11

even when the Court has cited these cases, they're all 

12

in the preLeon context where this Court didn't 

13

distinguish rights from remedies. 

14

 If you want to look at the founding, the 

15

controlling rule would be the common law rule.  And as 

16

we said in our brief, with no  with no disagreement 

17

from the other side, the common law rule dating back 

18

centuries was that ignorance of the law on the police 

19

officer's part, even if it was perfectly reasonable, 

20

didn't justify the stop. 

21

 And if I could say one last thing to Justice 

22

Scalia about the colloquies we were having before, with 

23

all due respect, I really do think there is nothing 

24

unusual about a party litigating a case up through the 

25

courts.  It may arise in Federal court or it may arise 

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in State court, but they can choose the arguments they

2

choose to raise. 

3

 And when we got a judgment in our favor from 

4

the North Carolina court of appeals, it was up to the 

5

State at that point to choose what arguments it wanted 

6

to pursue further in this case.  So just like a State 

7

may  a party may ride the First Amendment instead of 

8

the Second or a rights question instead of remedy, we 

9

think that's all that's happened here.
