ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

9

MR. GOLD:

Mr. Gold.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The procedure for imposing aggravated sentences

10

under California's Determinate Sentencing Law implicates

11

the bright line rule this Court set forth in Blakely and

12

Apprendi.

13

conviction which increases the penalty for a crime beyond

14

the prescribed statutory maximum must be proved to a jury

15

beyond a reasonable doubt.

16

Any fact other than the fact of a prior

The primary point of contention in this case is

17

what constitutes the statutory maximum under California's

18

Determinate Sentencing Law.

19

it's the middle term, whereas respondent maintains that

20

it's the upper term.

21

Petitioner believes that

In fact, this case really boils down to just one

22

question.

Can a judge in California legally impose an

23

upper term sentence based solely on the facts reflected

24

in the jury's verdict or the defendant's admissions.

25

answer to this question is no.

The

California's Determinate

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Sentencing Law specifies three possible prison terms for

2

each -- for each felony conviction, a lower term, a

3

middle term, and an upper term, although it mandates that

4

judges shall impose the middle term unless there are

5

factors of aggravation or mitigation.

6

law confirms that judges must impose the middle term

7

where there are no aggravating factors, and even the

8

state appears to concede the point.

9

California case

Because the middle term is the greatest

10

punishment a judge can impose based solely on the facts

11

reflected in the jury's verdict, it, and not the upper

12

term, constitutes the statutory maximum for -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Gold, I know you take that

14

position on the facts of this case, but is it not true

15

that there could be cases in which the verdict of the

16

jury would establish certain facts that would justify

17

going beyond the middle term?

18

case itself, as the justice who dissented in this case

19

thought the sentence was permissible in that case.

20

MR. GOLD:

For example, the Black

Your Honor, Justice Stevens, to the

21

extent that a fact is found by the jury which can be used

22

as an aggravating factor, but is not an element of the

23

crime or found by the jury as an enhancement, that could

24

be used to impose an upper term sentence.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

Would it always, then, be
4


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

surplusage in the indictment when a fact is charged and

2

subsequently found by a jury, is it always a surplus

3

fact?

4

is, otherwise, one assumes it would be a way of stating

5

an element of the offense, and as I understand it, under

6

California law, the element of the offense couldn't

7

satisfy the additional fact necessary to jump up to the

8

higher range.

9

Because otherwise -- I mean, what I'm getting at

MR. GOLD:

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, typically

10

under California law, in the information, they allege the

11

crime, and on occasion, some of the elements.

12

typically not all of the elements.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But

If in this case, the indictment

14

had charged -- had claimed that the defendant was the

15

father of the victim, would that have satisfied at least

16

the fact-finding for the aggravator of being in a

17

position of trust?

18

MR. GOLD:

Well, Your Honor, the fact that the

19

information would have alleged that does not mean that

20

the jury would have found that fact, because just because

21

-- what is alleged in the indictment or in the

22

information -

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24

MR. GOLD:

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That depends on the instructions.

Yes.
If the instructions said, you
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

know, you've got to find all of the things that are set

2

out in the information, and the jury returned a verdict,

3

then we would have found -- and that would satisfy the

4

requirement of an additional fact on an element.

5

MR. GOLD:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

instruction, I assume.

8

MR. GOLD:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

I believe so, Justice Souter.
That would be an erroneous

Yes, Justice Scalia.
You either have to have an

erroneous instruction or a special verdict.

11

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Only in the sense that it would

13

require the state to prove more than it had to prove for

14

the elements of the crime.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. GOLD:

Right.

Yes, Justice Souter, and I agree that

17

it would be no different than submitting aggravating

18

factors as a separate allegation to the jury as a

19

separate instruction.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, the thing that

21

concerns me about your case is that California's system

22

looks a lot like the Federal system after Booker.

23

haven't addressed the issue or had a case involving

24

review of reasonableness for upward departure.

25

least as the circuits have said it, in a federal case,

the district judge imposes a maximum, doesn't give any

2

reason for departing from what the guidelines might

3

suggest is a reasonable middle ground, he may be -- I

4

think in most circuits, that would be reversed.

5

Same here.

If a California judge imposes the

6

upper tier but doesn't make any findings, that's going to

7

be reversed.

9

offender likely to offend again, whatever, under most

15

MR. GOLD:

You

But how does this

Well, Your Honor, this system really is

16

-- this is just like -- this case is just like Blakely.

17

What the California Supreme Court in People against Black

18

found, they used references to reasonableness as a label

19

and a characterization to avoid the bright line rule of

20

Blakely and Apprendi.

21

Instead they tried to fit the Determinate

Sentencing Law within the Federal system this Court found

23

constitutional in Booker.

MR. GOLD:

impose the middle term.

11

He has to

He can't deviate -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My point is if he makes a

12

finding that justifies going up to the higher term, 16

13

years in this case, he doesn't have to impose that higher

14

term, he can go back to the middle term.

15
16

MR. GOLD:

No, no, you are absolutely right.

He

has discretion not to do that.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But does it say that the only

18

basis for a judge reasonably imposing the higher term is

19

that the judge has found a fact that the jury didn't

20

find.

21

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

It does say that?

As I read the

23

California opinion, they can go up above the lower, the

24

middle term for any reason, but it has to be reasonable.

25

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, what this -- what the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

California Supreme Court did, in this -

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe that's hard to justify in

3

terms of California's statute, but we take the California

4

Supreme Court's interpretation of that statute as the law

5

of California.

6

you read Black?

7

MR. GOLD:

So what is the answer to my question as

The answer to your question is that

8

Black has made no change whatsoever to the mandatory

9

nature of California's Determinate Sentencing Law, and it

10

has always operated in a mandatory way.

11
12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think -- let me give

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think your answer would be that

you -

14

how could it possibly be reasonable except for the

15

consideration of some additional fact?

16

reasonable other than facts?

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

What makes it

Atmosphere?

I mean -

If that is your answer, my

18

example will be -- I'll give you a specific example.

19

One example is the question of consecutive versus

20

concurrent sentences, which may have very little to do

21

with facts.

22

A second example might be that a judge in a

23

particular community says there's been an unbelievable

24

rash of breaking and entering.

25

this guideline, of the statute that embodies it, thought

I see how the writers of

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that breaking and entering was X, occurred with X

2

frequency, but we have in this community a sudden rash of

3

crime, such that I think the reasonable thing to do is to

4

increase the sentence as a deterrent.

5

Now, suppose that's what he writes.

And is there

6

anything in California law, as you understand Black, that

7

makes that unlawful?

8

MR. GOLD:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11
12
13
14

MR. GOLD:

Yes, Your Honor.
What?

I believe that the statements in Black

-JUSTICE BREYER:

Which statements make that

unlawful?
MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, in Black, the California

15

Supreme Court repeatedly stated that the way the system

16

works in California is that it is a mandatory system.

17

as an example, at 35 Cal.4th 1254, the court stated, "the

18

court cannot impose the upper term unless there is at

19

least one aggravating factor."

20

"in a case in which no aggravating factor can be found,

21

the judge cannot impose the upper term."

22

So

At 1260, the court said,

There are a number of statements throughout the

23

Black opinion that indicate the system has never changed

24

from a mandatory one to an advisory one, so that

25

reasonableness is not the issue.

Whether the system is

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

mandatory or advisory JUSTICE BREYER:

So in other words, when they say

3

mandatory factor, they mean aggravating factor, they mean

4

to exclude the kind of aggravating factor I just

5

mentioned.

6
7
8
9

MR. GOLD:

Well, a judge can consider those

aggravating factors.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, could he?

Could the judge

consider the fact that I just mentioned, that there's

10

been an extraordinary rash of breaking and entering in

11

the vicinity?

12

MR. GOLD:

Well, Your Honor -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. GOLD:

Yes or no?

Well, under California's law, they have

15

-- in addition to factors relating to the crime and

16

factors relating to the defendant, the judge can consider

17

unenumerated factors.

18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Unenumerated factors.

So mine

would be an unenumerated factor.

20

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

If he can consider

22

unenumerated factors -- now, I purposely picked mine

23

because I take it it is an example of a factor that

24

Apprendi would not require a jury to find.

25

It is a factor about the community.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

It is not a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

factor about this defendant.

2

the manner in which this defendant committed the crime.

3

It is not a fact of that kind.

4
5

MR. GOLD:

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if it were reasonable, it

would be upheld, or not?

8
9

Your Honor, I'm not sure whether that

sort of factor would be upheld as a -

6
7

It is not a factor about

MR. GOLD:

If it was found to be a decision that

was reasonably related to the crime -- I'm sorry, to the

10

decision being made by the judge, then yes, it would be

11

upheld as a valid aggravating factor.

12

it would still need to be then, if it would be considered

13

a valid aggravating factor, then it would need to be

14

tried by the jury.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I believe that

May I clarify one thing?

You

16

mean that a rash of crimes committed by people other than

17

the defendant could be an aggravating factor?

18

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, under California law, I'm

19

not saying that that would be upheld as a valid reason.

20

I'm just -

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But there's nothing in

22

California law suggesting that that would be upheld, is

23

there?

24

MR. GOLD:

No, Justice Stevens, there is not.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you draw -- as I understand
12


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it, your basic answer to Justice Breyer is, it may well

2

be that the situation in the community may justify a

3

judge in going to the -- to the high end of the range

4

that is possible, but that is not a factor that

5

determines what range is possible.

6

determines what range is possible is an aggravating fact,

7

and in that respect, it is different from the Federal

8

system.

9
10

And the fact that

Is that -

MR. GOLD:

That's absolutely right, Justice

Souter.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't understand it.

If he

12

does -- tell me again, would you?

13

response was going to be what Justice -- who suggested

14

it?

15

(Laughter).

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought your

Somebody on that side suggested

17

it.

18

crime in the community as an aggravating factor doesn't

19

make any sense.

20

makes the crime that this person committed worse, not the

21

need for punishment greater, but makes the crime worse.

22

Now, if that is not your answer, what is the answer that

23

you gathered, from the left of me?

24
25

That to talk about the fact that there's a lot of

MR. GOLD:

Aggravating factor means something that

Well, with all due respect to Justice

Breyer, I believe that that probably would not be an
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

aggravating factor that would be upheld under California

2

law.

3

whether an aggravating factor, no matter what it is,

4

whether it is considered reasonable, whether that's

5

enough to get the judge to go beyond the statutory

6

maximum.

7

I was just trying to make the distinction between

But -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought your position was that

8

aggravation must be reasonable.

9

indicates is that it is not going to consider anything

10

reasonable unless there's a fact to support it, unless

11

there's a finding of fact to support it.

12

position you take?

13
14

MR. GOLD:

What the court in Black

Is that the

The position as far as what Black is

saying?

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

Yes.
I think Black -- what Black is

17

saying is that an aggravating factor needs to be

18

reasonable, but I was trying to make the distinction -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I think that there's the

20

further indication that it is not going to be deemed

21

reasonable unless it is supported by a finding of fact,

22

as indicated in order to support one of the specific

23

guideline aggravators.

24

MR. GOLD:

25

Certainly if the aggravating factor is

not supported by the evidence, then it won't be
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

considered reasonable and the imposition of a upper term

2

won't be considered reasonable.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But -

I still don't understand the

4

distinction between the California system and a system of

5

advisory guidelines with reasonableness appellate review.

6

Let's take a hypothetical case where the statutory range

7

after convictions on multiple counts is zero to a hundred

8

years.

And let's say you have two judges who have these

9

cases.

And one sentences the defendant to zero,

10

probation.

11

hundred years.

12

The other one sentences the defendant to a

Without saying a word of explanation for either

13

sentence, isn't the appellate court in that situation

14

going to say, you have to tell us why you have chosen

15

zero or why you have chosen 100?

16

provides an explanation, isn't the trial judge

17

necessarily going to be reciting certain facts that the

18

judge believes to be true about the offense and the

19

offender?

20

MR. GOLD:

And if the trial judge

Your Honor, if you're describing the

21

Federal system or just a hypothetical system, my

22

understanding in a indeterminate type of system, a judge

23

can impose whatever sentence he wants.

24

not in a particular system, that will be reviewed for

25

reasonableness is a separate question as to what he 15

Alderson Reporting Company

And whether or

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

But isn't it reviewed for

2

reasonableness -- isn't the reasonableness review

3

necessarily going to require what is, in essence,

4

fact-finding by the trial judge, and a review of the

5

reasonableness of the sentence in light of those facts by

6

an appellate court?

7

MR. GOLD:

Yes, Your Honor.

But what -- in

8

Booker, what made the Federal system constitutional was

9

not the engraftment of the reasonableness review.

It was

10

rendering the mandatory guidelines advisory.

11

the aspect of California's Supreme Court Black decision

12

that they've misread the Booker decision.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's

Why is that, why is that so?

14

Why isn't the middle sentence, just like what the

15

guideline -- what the guideline would indicate?

16

Federal court would say, if I sentence within the

17

guideline, that will be presumptively valid, as many

18

courts have held.

19

presumptively valid.

20

Not this Court yet.

And if a

That would be

And if I go outside, I have to give a reason that

21

will survive appellate review.

22

middle sentence identical in function to the Federal

23

sentencing guidelines advice?

24
25

MR. GOLD:

Well, why isn't the

Justice Ginsburg, I think that it's the

mandatory nature in California of the middle term.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judge cannot exceed the middle term unless he finds at

2

least one aggravating factor.

3

the Federal system is that the judge can exceed the --

4

can exceed these guideline ranges and that they're just

5

advisory.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And my understanding in

To say that a sentence within the

7

guideline range is reasonable is not to say that a

8

sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable.

9

under the Federal system, it is perfectly possible --

So

10

unless, unless we hold otherwise -- for a judge to give a

11

sentence beyond the guideline range, and nonetheless to

12

be affirmed, because although the guideline range is

13

reasonable, there are other systems that would be

14

reasonable, right?

15

MR. GOLD:

Yes, Your -- Justice Scalia.

And I

16

think that to the extent that we are going to say that

17

any sentence outside this guideline range is going to be

18

unreasonable and necessarily require reversal is going to

19

be no different than the mandatory guideline system this

20

Court struck down in Booker itself.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the only part of the

22

California system that creates a problem is this -- the

23

one sentence in the statute that says the judge shall

24

impose the middle term unless he makes a finding.

25

MR. GOLD:

That's absolutely right.
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that if we rule in your

2

favor, the great benefit for criminal defendants in

3

California will be that judges can now depart without

4

making a particular finding, they can increase the

5

sentence even though they do not find an aggravator

6

within the limits of the California system.

7

MR. GOLD:

But Mr. Chief Justice, it is not clear

8

that that would be the result in California.

9

legislature could very well -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

Doesn't the decision in

11

Black suggest the Supreme Court thinks that would be the

12

result?

The California Supreme Court?

MR. GOLD:

I'm not sure that they think that that

14

would be the result.

15

attempt to reform or rewrite the statute so that it was

16

now an advisory system.

17

They certainly did not make an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought that -- it

18

looked to me that's what they were trying to do in Black.

19

I mean, in a way, it is kind of the -- the Black opinion,

20

the day after, if this Court were to agree with you, and

21

the California Supreme Court issued a decision looking a

22

lot like its decision in Black, that would be perfectly

23

valid.

24
25

In other words, saying that judges can depart
within this whole -- just like Booker, they can depart
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

within this whole range, and we're going to review their

2

determinations for reasonableness.

3

impose the middle sentence, they can impose a higher

4

sentence, and we will review it for reasonableness.

5

would be perfectly all right.

6

MR. GOLD:

They don't have to

That

Well, and that may very well be the

7

case, but that's not what the California Supreme Court

8

did in Black.

12

Determinate Sentencing Law.

13

And at no time did they purport to change the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But what they said was

14

judges can impose a sentence in either of the three --

15

any one of the three tiers, and we are going to review it

16

for reasonableness.

17

is going to be unreasonable, right?

18

MR. GOLD:

And if they don't make findings, it

Yes, but once again, the reasonableness

19

aspect is not what makes the system constitutional.

20

is the mandatory versus advisory aspect.

21

that's what made the Federal system constitutional based

22

on this Court's Booker decision.

23

engraftment of reason -- reviewing these sentences for

24

reasonableness.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It

And again,

It wasn't this

Well, to be quite -- to expose my

1

thinking on it, I found it rather ambiguous, pages 1260

and 1261.

what you said.

Is that what -- the first part of that is -I have no doubt.

It says just

But then you get over to the part, the discussion

6

of Booker, and when they start talking about Booker, they

7

seem to say, seem to say, that they're adopting what

8

Booker says.

9

that means, and that's why I used my example, that I

Now, if they are adopting what Booker says,

10

guess a judge would have the power, if it is reasonable,

11

to just say the guideline, though it says thus and so,

12

isn't right for my circumstance.

adopt it.

his decision not to follow it.

15

And therefore, I don't

And that would be reviewed for reasonableness,

And similarly, we have cases, for example, where

16

they're trying to construct a sentence and they can't get

it right because of the consecutive/concurrent nature, so

he adds a few things on, you see, to the sentence, in

19

order -- and then makes them concurrent.

have things where it is a very sophisticated conspiracy,

and the jury found the conspiracy.

characterization of a conspiracy, it is very

MR. GOLD:

Justice Ginsburg, the court could --

19

the court or the legislature could change section 1170(b)

20

to read something like:

21

"shall impose" the middle term.

22

to the extent that what they mean by "may" is they can

23

now impose the middle term based just on the facts found

24

by the jury.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"A judge may impose" instead of

MR. GOLD:

Couldn't they say that?

They could, and in effect, they do say

that -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Even though there is the

possibility that something above the middle term would

also be reasonable without necessarily finding a discrete

fact beyond the indictment to justify it.

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right?

There are The protection that

10

criminal defendants now have, that they cannot be

13

MR. GOLD:

Yes, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I -- and I -

That's true unless the

15

California legislature does what most states have done in

16

response to Booker, which is not that route at all. They

17

did maintain their determinate sentencing, but they just

18

required the jury finding.

19

of nine states have done.

20

MR. GOLD:

That's what I think seven out

Yes, Justice Stevens.

And that was the

21

point I was going to make, that that is a very likely

22

outcome, given what the majority of other states have

23

done.

24
25

And that, Mr. Chief Justice, would be a CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that now the defendant

will have the protection of his jury determining his
22

guilt, will not only have to know the evidence of his

2

guilt of the crime, but also know why he's likely to

3

re-offend in the future, things like he used a firearm,

4

all the bad things that will increase his sentence and

5

might affect how the jury views the issue of guilt in the

6

first place.

7

MR. GOLD:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

Because

8

for those type of prejudicial factors, California is

9

well-positioned to handle those, because they do so

10

anyway in bifurcated proceedings.

11

enhancement allegations that relate to recidivism or even

12

gang allegations, anything that's prejudicial are handled

13

at a separate proceeding after trial.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There are often

And are there a half a

dozen jury trials in each -- for each of those various

16

aggravating factors that now have to be tried to the

jury?

MR. GOLD:

No, Your Honor, what I'm trying to say

19

is that basically California does that anyway now.

20

of the factors that relate to the defendant have to do

21

with recidivism.

that are alleged in the information, and are tried in a

MR. LAURENCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The central lesson from Booker, from the real

portion of Booker, is that not every constraint that's

within a range that requires fact-finding invokes the

Sixth Amendment requirement of a jury trial.

A reasonableness constraint that requires the

But we haven't held, and I don't believe most of

the Federal courts have held, that if you go beyond the

that is the case with the California system, if you go

We don't need to identify specifically what that

point is, the guideline range or something close to it.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the difference is, in the

Federal system, the judge can go above and it can be
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reasonable based on facts that were found by the jury.

2

But in California, to go beyond the middle range

3

up to the upper range, it must be a fact not found by the

4

jury.

5

MR. LAURENCE:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7

MR. LAURENCE:

8

Is that not correct?

That's only correct because

California has a discrete three-term sentence.

9
10

Well, Your Honor -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Correct.

But whatever the

reason, it is correct.

11

MR. LAURENCE:

It is correct, Your Honor, but the

12

central point of both Booker and California is that that

13

upper term is being reversed not because it's

14

unauthorized, but because it's unreasonable.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

On one hand, in one case, the

16

unreasonableness depends on a finding of fact not made by

17

the jury.

18

that finding by a jury.

19

But in the Federal system, it does not require

MR. LAURENCE:

Your Honor, if a Federal judge

20

wished to impose a life term, there would have to be

21

something to justify it, or it would be reversed on

22

appeal.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

It wouldn't necessarily be a

24

fact.

It could be a fact.

What it says in here is that

25

if the -- they speak of a circumstance related to the
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

crime, or the offender.

And in a case in which no such

2

aggravating factor can be found, the judge cannot impose

3

the upper term.

4

Now, I grant you there's some language that I --

5

it seems to me on the next few paragraphs, seems to say

6

something a little different.

7

just take that, seems to say, unless, Judge, you find a

8

fact about the situation that would make it reasonable to

9

go above the middle range, you can't, under the law.

But that language, if you

10

Now, if that's what it says, I have to admit, I

11

find it a little difficult to distinguish from Blakely

12

and other cases where I dissented, but the Court's law is

13

what the majority says.

14

it, unless you can tell me that I'm wrong in that.

15

MR. LAURENCE:

So that seems to me almost like

I would say you are wrong, Your

16

Honor, simply because California has construed its

17

sentencing law in 1170(b) as imposing nothing more than a

18

reasonableness -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but if -- as I understand it,

20

it has construed it by saying that if you go above the

21

middle term without a discrete finding of fact beyond

22

what has to be proven to the jury, it is unreasonable as

23

a matter of law.

system post Booker.

And that unreasonableness as a matter

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. LAURENCE:

Well, Your Honor, I would disagree,

because the upper term, the statutory maximum in Booker

3

would also be necessarily unreasonable if there was no

justification offered by the trial court -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the justification under the

I have two responses to that, Your

Honor.

First of all, with regard to what the ruling in

20

Booker was, the court's discretion has to be exercised in

21

relation to the policy considerations set out in 3553(a),

22

which are the same policy considerations that the court

23

must look at, very similar in California, that there are

-- the court doesn't have unbridled discretion, select

25

any term based on whim, based on whatever it feels would

be -- whatever he decides to do on Tuesday.

2

The court has to do it with regard to the policy

3

considerations that are inherent in what the guidelines

decisions were, and what the legislature established

should be appropriate sentencing considerations.

He can go, you know, in theory, under

Booker, he can go above the guideline range consistent

with policy positions that may not be precise, without

necessarily making discrete findings of fact.

I mean, you'd have to judge it in each individual

And under the

MR. LAURENCE:

That's a significant

Well, it can't be an element. And

that -- obviously, there could be a circumstance where

be beyond the elements.

simply because you shouldn't be double counting what's

already established.

But it can't be an element

The range is set by the elements of the offense,

15

that all three terms are available from the jury verdict

18

than simply the defendant committed the offense.

that's the same with the Federal guidelines.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you are going to make a

And

Simply

It isn't the same in the Federal

guidelines.

Under the Federal guidelines, the judge

23

could say, you know, I think this offense is more serious

than what the sentencing commission thought, and these

25

are my reasons for it.

There was a dissent, you know -31


Alderson Reporting Company

1

the sentencing commission's determinations are

2

reasonable, but they are surely not the only reasonable

disposition.

4

And it is open to a Federal district judge to say,

well, that's what they thought, and I took it into

account, and I seriously considered it, and I think they

are wrong on this, I think this is more serious.

that could be a perfectly reasonable determination.

couldn't be done in California.

MR. LAURENCE:

Yes, it could, Your Honor.

And
That

And I

11

would refer you to Rule 4.410 in our appendix, page 2 and

that overlay our sentencing guidelines or our sentencing

system, include deterrence for this defendant and

deterring others from committing the same crime, that you

can just look to the -- what is happening in this

particular neighborhood, as the examples brought out.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Are you saying to us that under

exactly the thought process that Justice Scalia just

outlined and put that down on paper, without finding any

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You say in your brief, which

6

doesn't seem to me to comport with what you are saying

7

here, for a judge to exceed the base range, for example,

8

by applying enhancement or an alternative sentencing

9

scheme, the predicate fact for the enhancement or

10

alternative scheme must be pleaded and proved to a jury

11

beyond a reasonable doubt.

12

There's no indication there that the judge could

13

just say, I think more deterrence is necessary and

14

therefore, I'm going to exceed the base range.

15

just totally incompatible with that.

16

MR. LAURENCE:

That's

Your Honor, that's to exceed the

17

base range, to go beyond the three terms.

impose an enhancement for gun use, or for an enhancement

20

base range.

MR. LAURENCE:

Well, Your Honor, I think the rules

examples set out are not exclusive and not determinant,

MR. LAURENCE:

And to talk about the need for

more deterrence as an aggravating factor, that's not an

15

aggravating factor.

24
25

MR. LAURENCE:

It's not an aggravating

Well, Your Honor, the importance of

our position, the central thrust of our position is that
36

the reasonableness constraint, the constraint imposed

constraint.

It doesn't matter if factors are required -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it can be a reasonableness

requires a finding of discrete facts for reasonableness.

The two are not exclusive.

read in light of subsection (b), and subsection (b) seems

to answer the ambiguity by saying preponderance of the

evidence.

And it seems to me that we've got to consider the

The ambiguity has got to be

That means a fact finding.

MR. LAURENCE:

Well, let me explain it this way,

Your Honor, that it doesn't matter from our perspective

20

whether or not there is a factor required in order to say

21

that something is -- that the end point is reasonable, or

22

if you are taking deterrence into account, that that's

23

not -- it's not necessary for our argument because our

24

position is that even if a factor is required -

So do you think under subsection
37


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(b) of Rule 4.420, if a judge said, I just think the

2

policy of deterrence requires something heavier, you

think that statement by the judge would satisfy the

requirement that circumstances in aggravation shall be

5

established by a preponderance of the evidence?

6

MR. LAURENCE:

7

No, Your Honor.
All right.

that you cannot hold your position consistently with the

Well, Your Honor, I would refer

back to Black at 1255, which is the important part.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is Black repealing the rule of

13

court?

I mean, Black -- if we refer back to Black, we

14

get the ambiguity that Justice Breyer has raised.

15

order to solve the ambiguity, we look to the court rule.

16

MR. LAURENCE:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In

Yes.
Under the court rule, you admit

18

that a judge's policy consideration, however sincerely

19

held, could not satisfy the requirement to prove

20

aggravation by a preponderance.

the issue?

23

we can't do it.

25

Isn't that the end of

I mean, if California wants to amend its

Well, no, Your Honor, but

California has construed 1170(b) as not requiring a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then why didn't you give a

different answer to my question?

it is reasonable for the court to conclude that

7

deterrence really requires something tougher than the

enough and (b) wouldn't preclude it?

defendant committed the crime in.

If we take that away

Yes, I believe it would.
That would satisfy the
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

requirement of, as it puts it, establishing by a

2

preponderance of the evidence?

3

MR. LAURENCE:

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Uh-huh.

Yes.

That was not what I understood

5

California law to be or your position to be until this

6

moment.

7

MR. LAURENCE:

Well, Your Honor, I have not been

8

suggesting that that single factor is what makes

9

California's law constitutional.

What makes California's

10

law constitutional is the fact that the constraint

11

imposed on the court's discretion in selecting terms is a

12

reasonableness requirement, just like Booker.

13
14
15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Reasonably -- that does not

answer the problem.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think the California Supreme

16

Court and the California legislature would be astounded

17

to think that this is what they have wrought.

18

obviously intended to establish a scheme in which the

19

judge would apply the middle range, not using his own

20

perception as to whether more punishment is justified or

21

not, unless there's some circumstances about this crime

22

that make this person more guilty, and that's what you

23

usually mean by aggravating circumstances, not the fact

24

that you believe the crime should bear -- in general,

25

should bear, a higher penalty.

They

I think they would be

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

astounded to find that this is what they have created.
MR. LAURENCE:

Your Honor, let me take a step back

3

then and say that, even with the requirement that there

4

be some factor, putting aside deterrence as a

5

possibility, California's system as structured, which

6

only requires a reasonableness constraint, does not

7

violate the Constitution.

8

all it's saying is that if you're going to the absolute

9

maximum, the farthest point on the spectrum available, if

And the reason being because

10

there's no justification offered, it will be reversed as

11

unreasonable, not as unavailable.

12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's the whole problem with

your case.

14

MR. LAURENCE:

Certainly.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That there's -- and

16

incidentally, under the rules, under 4.410, those are

17

general objectives of sentencing.

18

MR. LAURENCE:

Yes, Your Honor.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

different from circumstances.

21

MR. LAURENCE:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that is a term of art that's

Yes, Your Honor.
So it's only the circumstances

23

that have to be found by a preponderance of the evidence.

24

The general objectives can still be considered.

25

MR. LAURENCE:

Yes, Your Honor.
41


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what we are involved with in

2

this case and with this criminal, whose conviction and

3

sentence we're reviewing here, are circumstances that

4

aggravate, and these do require findings.

5

MR. LAURENCE:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

it's not reasonable.

8

MR. LAURENCE:

9

Yes, Your Honor.
If those findings aren't there,

That is correct, Your Honor.

Let's

just take it a step back and say that what we're talking

10

about is -- even if there are circumstances that are

11

required, even if there are some justifications that the

12

court must find aggravating factors, still the only

13

constraint is reasonableness.

14

And let me quote from what Black said about

15

1170(b), how it's been construed, not from the facial

16

language, but how it's been construed.

17

says is on page 1255 that:

18

worded in mandatory language, the requirement that an

19

aggravating factor exist is merely a requirement that the

20

decision to impose the upper term be reasonable."

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And what Black

"Although subdivision (b) is

So what we have -- now, this has

22

clarified it, but I don't know what to do.

23

read the opinion the way you're saying, I would say the

24

California court, which is a good court, conscientious,

25

managing a huge system of criminal law in the state,
42

Alderson Reporting Company

I think if I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

probably bigger than the Federal system, reads Blakely

2

and they see that those guidelines in California as

3

previously understood were violated.

4

And they're thinking, how do we maintain this

5

system as constitutional.

6

1261, which can be read as saying we're Bookerizing it,

7

and we come as close to Booker as necessary to make it

8

constitutional.

9

And therefore, they write

Now, that would be an understandable judicial

10

reaction, and I can read the opinion as saying that, at

11

which point I'm not certain what we're supposed to say,

12

because I have no doubt that your unease reflects the

13

fact that prior to Black, in California, it would have

14

been pretty unheard of for a judge to depart upward on

15

grounds other than factual grounds related to the

16

circumstances of the crime or offender.

17

no doubt that this opinion is written to try to save the

18

California system.

19

But I also have

All right, so now what do I do?

MR. LAURENCE:

Well, Your Honor, I think that the

20

one thing that seems to be giving you some difficulty is

21

the fact that California didn't explicitly say in Black,

22

we are now officially Bookerizing our system.

23

reason for that is because California had already

24

implicitly construed the system as making all three terms

25

legally available based on the jury verdict alone, and
43

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

had simply used a reasonableness requirement.

2

And that goes back to Hernandez, back in 1988,

3

when California essentially anticipated Apprendi, and

4

distinguished between making enhancements available based

5

on the jury verdict on the elements alone, versus the

6

three, the three components of the triad scheme.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it is the same old record

8

we've been playing.

But the reasonableness requirement

9

has to be explained further.

And when you explain it

10

further, you find that there must be findings by a

11

preponderance of the evidence for any of the aggravating

12

or mitigating circumstances that are set out.

13

different from the objectives of sentencing.

14

MR. LAURENCE:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16
17

That's

Yes, Your Honor.
But the objectives of sentencing

are not what's involved in this case.
MR. LAURENCE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I -- whether

18

or not the objectives of sentencing are involved is not

19

the critical point of the constitutionality of this

20

system.

21

As far as California is concerned, what is

22

important is that, first of all, the fact that the

23

preponderance of the evidence requirement is essentially

24

the same as what's involved in making discretionary

25

findings within a range in the Federal system.
44

Alderson Reporting Company

And we're

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

talking about the findings within a range.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would you want us to hold that,

3

you know, that we uphold the system here in an opinion

4

that says what California's sentencing judges may do

5

under California law, as you've described it to us, is

6

that they -- they may exceed the middle range whenever

7

they think that that is a better result, whenever they

8

think that that's reasonable?

9
10
11
12

MR. LAURENCE:
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
And you think California would be

happy with that?
MR. LAURENCE:

Yes.

Reasonableness is the

13

touchstone of the constraint imposed upon the trial

14

courts in selecting among the three terms, and that would

15

be a perfectly -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, including reasonable

17

disagreement with the level of severity that the

18

legislature has provided in the middle term.

19

other legislatures may have provided higher severity and

20

the judge says, I simply disagree with the California

21

legislature.

22

some other legislature might have done what I do.

And it's a reasonable disagreement, because

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, Your Honor.
That isn't reasonable?

it reasonable?

MR. LAURENCE:

Reasonableness has to be tied to

the policy considerations that underlie the -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He ties it to that.

He says, I

just disagree with the California legislature as to

5

whether this is enough to prevent the defendant from

6

committing this kind of a crime.

7

cites another state which provides a much higher sentence

8

for the same crime.

9

Can that possibly be unreasonable?

MR. LAURENCE:

10

under the California -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

reasonableness.

13

And look -- and he

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that

Then you don't mean

You mean something else.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

May I ask you this question?

14

Excluding capital cases, in your view -- anecdotally, if

15

it has to be that -- what percentage of cases that go to

16

juries, that go to jury trial, result in bifurcated

17

proceedings for sentencing purposes?

18

MR. LAURENCE:

19

would be around 10 percent.

20

--

21

10 percent?

I would say probably a rough guess

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's -- we're dealing with

On that question, may I ask --

22

on that subject, may I ask you this question:

23

read the brief filed by the National Association -- the

24

Lawyers, which has a long discussion of the practical
46

consequences in other states and in California?

2

MR. LAURENCE:

Yes.

to you, rather persuasive on the fact it's not such a big

deal as we thought it might be.

7

that brief that is not accurate.

MR. LAURENCE:

And I'd like you to have

Well, Your Honor, it would

certainly be a big deal to California.

But more

10

importantly, if this Court were to say that a

11

reasonableness constraint reinvokes the Sixth Amendment,

12

you would be basically throwing into doubt the way Booker

13

has reformed the Federal system as well, because -

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They say, if I remember it

15

correctly, that if the impact in a four day trial would

16

normally be an extra hour for the jury, that that's about

17

the burden on the system.

18

of your cases are pleaded out by guilty, so it's not the

19

major thing that we originally thought it might be.

20

you think, just across the board, are they fairly

21

accurate in their description of what happens in other

22

states as far as you're advised?

23

MR. LAURENCE:

And of course, 90 some percent

Do

As far as the other states go, yes,

24

be a requirement of a secondary trial after the main

3

relevant considerations have to take place in this

4

particular case, which can be a multitude of things.

5

6

justify an upper term sentence.

7

absolutely nothing, not a scintilla of justification,

8

that an upper term becomes unreasonable and therefore

9

10
11
12

But it would also impose a burden of trying to

In

It's only when there's

How many cases would have

to be resentenced if we were to reverse in this case?
MR. LAURENCE:

It's my understanding that under --

13

currently in California about 20 percent of the prison

14

population has an upper term.

15

cases there are on a year-by-year basis, or since Blakely

16

or since Apprendi, but probably in the thousands,

17

possibly.

18
19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

So I don't know how many

You had 200,000

incarcerated when I last looked.

20

MR. LAURENCE:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

And the -- once again, the important aspect,

22

what's -- the key aspect is whether or not a term is

23

legally available, and whether or not there's a

24

constraint that's imposed that takes away that legal

25

availability as a threshold matter, rather than a
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reasonableness review requirement.

2

California has consistently construed 1170(b) as

3

imposing a reasonableness requirement.

4

Booker said that a reasonableness requirement does not

5

limit the availability of those upper terms.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This Court in

Do you know of any case in which

7

a California trial judge has gone beyond the middle range

8

not on the basis of a fact that that judge has found, but

9

rather on the basis of some general policy he thinks that

10

the punishment should be greater, something along the

11

lines of what Justice Breyer suggested?

12
13
14

MR. LAURENCE:

No, Your Honor, I'm not aware of

it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not either, and I would be

15

astounded if any trial judge would read these statutes

16

and court rules that way.

MR. LAURENCE:

Once again, Your Honor, that is not

18

the critical component of why this system is

19

constitutional.

20

our briefs.

21

that that is what would save California's system.

And that's not what we are advancing in

It's not the position that I'm arguing here,

22

What saves California's system is that the only

23

constraint imposed is a reasonableness constraint, and

24

that reasonableness constraint, 1170(b), has been

25

interpreted over time as simply imposing the abuse of
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discretion standard on the court, and that has been

2

applied to all three terms.

3

reviewed for an abuse of discretion, as is the lower

4

term.

5

The middle term is also

And what is important to note is, even though the

6

middle term -- the only reason the middle term has been

7

given the label "presumptive" is because the court

8

doesn't have to expressly articulate its reasons for

9

selecting it.

But it still has to do a balancing to make

10

a determination as to what's reasonable, including the

11

middle term.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

Mr. Gold, you have four minutes remaining.

14

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER GOLD

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. GOLD:

Thank you, Mr. Laurence.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I want

17

to respond to three items.

18

Justice, you were asking about what would be the effect

19

in California on those that have already been sentenced.

20

The first is, Mr. Chief

The only information I have was what was contained

21

in Black, that only 13 to 17 percent of cases are

22

sentenced in the upper range.

23

also consider is that most -- in most cases, the

24

difference between the middle term and upper term is

25

really only a year.

But what the Court should

In this case, it is four years,
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which is somewhat unusual.

2

So in those cases, a lot of the people will have

3

already served their prison sentences by the time that

4

they would be able to benefit from any result in this

5

case.

6

I also wanted to echo what Justice Kennedy, I

7

believe, was saying.

California Rules of Court, Rule

8

4.410 is just general objectives of sentencing.

9

are not aggravating factors.

These

You can't take into account

10

achieving uniformity of sentencing, securing restitution

11

for the victims, these aren't aggravating factors that

12

the judge considers.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Rule 4.410(b) says

14

that the sentencing judge should be guided by the

15

criteria in these rules.

16

MR. GOLD:

In sentencing, but I don't believe as

17

far as finding them as aggravating factors, these are not

18

facts that judges in California use to impose upper-term

19

sentences.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, but a reading of the rule

21

indicates under (b), as the Chief Justice points out,

22

that the judge could take into account these policy

23

objectives.

24
25

MR. GOLD:

Your Honor, all I can tell you is that

I've never seen a judge take these into account as an
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

aggravating factor.

2

case law, if these have been ever upheld as valid

3

aggravating factors.

4

And I would be surprised, under the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I think it is true that it

5

doesn't seem to be involved in this case.

6

we're under 4.420.

7
8
9

MR. GOLD:

Certainly, yes.

In this case,

Certainly, not in this

case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We have to conclude that

10

the California Supreme Court has misread California law

11

to agree with you, don't we?

12

MR. GOLD:

No, Your Honor.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, I see 1170(b).

14

And I understand your argument, but when I read the

15

California Supreme Court opinion in Black, it says, well,

16

this is what it means.

17

means, but they get to interpret it, don't they?

18

MR. GOLD:

It doesn't seem to be what it

They do get to interpret how their

19

statutes operate, Your Honor, but I believe that they are

20

consistent in saying that this is a mandatory system.

21

In every one of their quotes, they talk about either a

22

judge must impose the middle term unless there are

23

aggravating factors, or they talk about the

24

requirement -- I was going to mention Justice Breyer's

25

quote from Black.
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And even in that one, they say because an

2

aggravating factor under California law may include any

3

factor that the judge reasonably deems to be relevant,

4

and then say the Determinate Sentencing Law's requirement

5

that an upper-term sentence be imposed only if an

6

aggravating factor exists.

7

requirement that this aggravating factor must exist.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

They always talk about the

So it is comparable to Booker.

And then in the preceding four paragraphs, they correctly

10

describe Booker?

11

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

And we have no doubt that they

12

are trying to fit the Determinate Sentence Law within

13

Booker, but Booker is about making -- the magic word, as

14

it were, is advisory versus mandatory, not

15

reasonableness.

16

So yes, the California system is reasonable.

17

that's what the California Supreme Court is talking about

18

--

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

Under any guideline system,

20

whether it's mandatory or advisory, once -- if you have a

21

mandatory system or an advisory system with appellate

22

review, once the appellate review function has been

23

performed, will it not be the case that trial judges will

24

not have unfettered discretion, will have very limited

25

discretion in choosing, making these sentencing policy
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

determinations?
That's the whole purpose of a guidelines system.

3

That the individual trial judges don't get to decide, you

4

know, how much deterrence they think is necessary, or how

5

severe they think an individual crime is, that there's

6

supposed to be some kind of uniformity.

7

MR. GOLD:

Well, Justice Alito, there is

8

discretion in our system.

But it is the discretion to

9

impose an upper-term after finding aggravating factors.

10

And I think that in an indeterminate system, as you were

11

discussing earlier, I think that that -- I'm not sure.

12

It depends what the system is, as far as what the

13

reasonableness constraints are.
