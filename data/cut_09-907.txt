We'll hear argument

Services.

Mr. Burke.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER P. BURKE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BURKE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

In 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Act.

12

It made a policy decision to limit judicial discretion

13

on a case-by-case basis in the area of reasonable and

14

necessary expenses.

15

that entailed an aggregate set amount of expenses for an

16

individual.

17

It did so by creating a formula

Now, Congress could have created this from

18

scratch.

19

instead, there were figures that the IRS already had,

20

based on Census Bureau statistics, that said nationwide,

21

in a certain area, an individual would spend this much a

22

month on average.

23

It could have used an arbitrary figure.

But

In the case of Mr. Ransom, that's

24

approximately 2500 a month.

Forgetting about how it's

25

divided up, if I had 100 people come in and answer the
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

following five questions the same way Mr. Ransom did,

2

and that's age, location, household size, gross income,

3

and if you have a vehicle, how many, they would all get

4

a $2500 standard aggregate deduction, which works out to

5

$150,000 over a 5-year period.

6

Now, the crux of this is whether or not

7

courts are allowed to dig in and cut out pieces of the

8

standard aggregate amount.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

Why is that the crux of it?

Congress made reference to the local standards, right?

11

MR. BURKE:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

And were the -- was the

13

commentary in the Collection Financial Standards in

14

existence at the time when Congress enacted this

15

provision?

16

MR. BURKE:

There was a Collection Financial

17

Analysis that was in place, and it was noted in 1998 as

18

a prior version of the bill that ultimately wasn't

19

passed.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that explains what the

21

IRS understands the local standards to mean; isn't that

22

right?

23

MR. BURKE:

I would disagree with that.

I

24

would say -- well, it would -- it would explain what the

25

IRS means, but that's where I would end it, because the
4

discretionary.

3

They are

They -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I understand that, but

4

Congress decided to make reference to the local

5

standards in this bankruptcy provision, didn't it?

6

MR. BURKE:

Standards.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

MR. BURKE:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

It didn't go beyond that.
And this -- and at the time

10

when it did that, there was official IRS commentary

11

regarding the meaning of those standards, correct?

12
13

MR. BURKE:

For the IRS to use in collecting

taxes.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And your argument is that

15

Congress intended to adopt the standards promulgated by

16

the IRS, but not the IRS's interpretation of the

17

standards.

18
19
20
21

MR. BURKE:

Correct, not their methodology

or interpretation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Doesn't the chart say

"ownership costs"?

22

MR. BURKE:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you would read that

24

to mean non-costs as well?

I mean, if the -- if the

25

table is called ownership costs, then why not use the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

IRS's definition of what costs are, and that definition

2

says, what, loan payments and lease payments?

3

MR. BURKE:

Because you -- we have to look

4

at it as a standard aggregate.

5

is -- okay, the Bankruptcy Code doesn't define ownership

6

costs.

And ownership costs could be the replacement

7

value.

It could be buying a new vehicle.

8

the costs associated with making payments on a vehicle.

9

And what I mean by that

It could be

What that -- that average number is, in this

10

case, $471, is a nationwide figure that somebody would

11

spend on average in a month.

12

one individual spends that amount.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't mean that any

Mr. Burke, isn't it -­

14

isn't it the case that, even on the other side's

15

interpretation of it, it doesn't come down to actual

16

costs anyway?

17

it, that so long as there is one payment, you get the

18

entire deduction?

19
20
21

Isn't it the case, or do I misunderstand

MR. BURKE:

That's their position, or even

$1.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even one payment of $1, you

22

get the entire deduction.

So to argue this case as

23

though it's a question of whether you actually expend

24

the money that you're getting the credit for is

25

simply -- is simply false.

You don't do that under

6

Alderson Reporting Company

either side's interpretation, right?

2

MR. BURKE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Again, I would perhaps -­
I'm trying to help you,

Mr. Burke.

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Burke, before you

7

respond to that question, isn't it so that in the event

8

that Justice Scalia just proposed, the trustee could

9

propose an amendment to the plan to reflect that that

10

cost is no longer being incurred?

11
12

MR. BURKE:
incurred.

13

The cost has never been

That's the point.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -­
My question is:

In the

14

situation that Justice Scalia proposed, it's not

15

automatic that the $471 gets deducted because there

16

could be proposed an amendment of the plan to reflect

17

that that -- there's no longer any expense for

18

ownership.

19

MR. BURKE:

In the situation where there is

20

a dollar, of course, an amendment can be made.

21

the -- the dollar doesn't show up in the means test.

22

The means test is the aggregate -­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But see

But it isn't -- it isn't

24

automatic that because there's one payment, then

25

forever, the rest of the 5 years, he gets to deduct the

That's what the lower court

said.

under the tax law as well?

MR. BURKE:

Excuse me.

What -- what

Do they make an adjustment

Of course -- under the tax law,

you get a standard deduction.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. BURKE:

A standard -­

No different than here.

Nobody

11

goes behind the scenes and says, hey, what is that

12

standard deduction?

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

So that they -­

14

what is suggested is that you look at it and apply the

15

IRS's approach as to whether you get into the chart, but

16

then you don't use the IRS's approach when the trustee

takes you out of the chart.

22

years to spend.

They are not saying whether he actually

These are averages across the nation.

to a car ownership expense, we're not saying spend $471.

5

Oh, you have no payment?

6

7

No.

Congress did not say go

And when it comes

You didn't spend anything for

What it's saying is, over 5 years, I

8

have a cost associated with owning that vehicle, whether

9

it's a loan or lease payment, whether it's replacing the

10

vehicle, whether it's major repairs, on average, across

11

the country.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

You do.

You do, but the

13

difficulty that I -- I don't get the answer to

14

Justice Ginsburg's first question.

15

Of course you have all kinds of costs

16

dealing with ownership, but what the IRS says, what it

17

says in the statute, is you are supposed to take the

18

applicable costs from IRS.

19

is it has something called "ownership costs."

20

MR. BURKE:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

Correct.
And it defines those as

$471.

23

MR. BURKE:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

And what it has on page 5a

Correct.
And then on 3a, where it

says what ownership costs are, it says the
9

transportation standards consist of nationwide figures

2

for monthly loan or lease payments, referred to as

4

costs means monthly loan or lease payments, nothing

5

else.

6

So when I read that, I said ownership

Now, you have all kinds of other things.

7

It's just these words "ownership costs" don't refer to

8

those other things, because of that definition given

9

right there.

10

That's what I thought Justice Ginsburg was

initially asking.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, I was.
And I -- and how -- how do

13

you get out of that what I think of as very, very clear

14

language which says what these standards refer to?

MR. BURKE:
the numbers.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. MAYNARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The Bankruptcy Code precludes an above­

his creditors $471 a month for a car payment that he

A debtor with -­

take an applicable monthly expense amount.

Your adversary said that

No, Your Honor.

I think if,

over the 60-month period looking forward, you know, that

I don't think so, Your Honor,

for this reason, which is that the national standards

are food, clothing, house cleaning supplies, things that

you expect every debtor to have.

You don't see much

litigation about those expenses.

The local standards,

11

however, operate differently.

12

view's different from the government's, Justice Scalia.

13

In our view, under the local standards and the way that

14

they apply as explained in the Collection Financial

Standards, is that the debtor is allowed their actual

expense for the local standard or the amount in the

Petitioner has no expense whatsoever, and so it's not

6

But in our view, Justice Sotomayor -- in our

view, you get it from the language of the statute that

4

then be able to take the deduction?

5

MS. MAYNARD:

Would the debtor

If the debtor owns the car

6

outright at the time they file for bankruptcy, they

7

would not get the deduction.

8

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Even though if you look

ahead, if you project forward, it's pretty clear that
the debtor is going to have to incur those expenses?

11

MS. MAYNARD:

They would not get the

12

deduction under this calculation.

However, under this

13

Court's decision in Lanning, when one goes to project

14

the disposable income, it's conceivable that the debtor

15

could prove that it's known or virtually certain that

16

they will need a new car and that that could be

17

accounted for.

18

But -- but also the Bankruptcy Code in 1329

19

allows for modification of a plan, and so when the time

20

arises that their car conks out and they need a new car,

21

they can move to modify their plan.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think it's -­

Well, the modification works

context because what you want to know is, does this

liquidation.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

This was about

available as reasonably necessary expenses for

2

above-median-income debtors.

3

And I think that point is made perfectly

4

clear by the fact that if you can compare it to what

5

happens now to a below-median-income debtor, a

6

below-median-income debtor in the same situation as

7

Petitioner, who owns his car outright, would be allowed

8

no amount as an expense for his vehicle, because he

9

doesn't have an actual expense that's reasonably

10

necessary.

11

And I think that the 2005 Congress would

12

think it was a senseless result, as they argue here,

13

that Petitioner gets $471, above-median-income debtor,

14

the very class of debtors with whom Congress was

15

concerned in the 2005 amendments, to shield from his

creditors over the life of the plan when he has no

And has -- has that point been litigated?

4

MS. MAYNARD:

That -- that sentence is

5

somewhat of a conundrum, Your Honor, and I think that

6

the Court doesn't need to decide the meaning here,

7

because whatever it does, it doesn't get Petitioner

within the Romanette ii calculation -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No -- no, but it would -­

It would eliminate

Well, my understanding of that

provision is that it serves two purposes.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MS. MAYNARD:

That it?

Serves two purposes.

The

20

first is that it makes clear -- in the back of our

21

brief, we have the other necessary expenses from the

22

IRM.

23

categories of other necessary expenses are secured or

24

legally perfected debts and unsecured debts.

25

And on -- near the back, page 25a, two of the

So I think the -- the otherwise -- the
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"notwithstanding" sentence makes clear that Romanette ii

2

should not capture those other unsecured debts and

3

secured debts, that it's the very purpose of this whole

4

calculation to figure out how much money you have to pay

5

those things.

6

The second purpose the sentence serves is to

7

make sure that there is no double-counting, because

8

Romanette iii, the very next provision in the means

9

test, allows the debtor to claim monthly payments for

10

secured debts.

11

debts, and in our view if you actually have a car loan

12

-- now, remember again, he neither has a car loan, nor a

13

car lease payment, nor any kind of ownership payment.

14

Now, many car loans are probably secured

But if -- if one actually did have a car

15

loan that was secured by the car, which I think is the

16

vast majority of car loans, in our view the debtor

17

expenses nothing for that under Romanette ii, and only

18

the actual amount of that debt under Romanette iii.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the -- the

20

general position was you get either the actual payment

21

or the 471, of whichever is higher.

22

MS. MAYNARD:

Whichever is less.

23

I think that -- that's my understanding of

24

how the local standards work, Your Honor.

25

then, as a practical matter, that really will end up
41

Alderson Reporting Company

I think,

Official

1

only applying to car leases with respect to

2

transportation ownership costs, because I think that the

3

"notwithstanding" sentence removes secured car loans

4

from Romanette ii and has them calculated under

5

Romanette iii, where there is no comparable cap.

6

And the -- but -- but the point at issue in

7

this case doesn't involve the interaction between

8

Romanette ii and Romanette iii, because no matter how

9

those two things interact, when the debtor has no

10

payment whatsoever, he ought not to be able to claim any

11

car ownership costs, because what we're trying to figure

12

out is what amounts does he reasonably need for his

13

maintenance and support?

14

important question.

15

And this question is a very

This scenario happens a lot.

In the 2007 study that U.S. Trustees did is

16

-- at Congress's request to which Petitioner cites in

17

his reply brief, the average overpayment of a debtor in

18

claiming this transportation ownership expense was $335,

19

which is a lot when you're talking about the standard in

20

the chart being 471.

21

getting this expense either above their amount or when

22

they have no such expense at all, and so even if the

23

Court doesn't resolve these other issues that are

24

implicated by this case, the decision here is a simple

25

one, which is:

There are many debtors who are

This debtor has no applicable monthly

expense amount for transportation ownership costs, and

2

he shouldn't be allowed to expense any amount for that.

The only question this Court needs to

resolve in this case is whether the vehicle ownership

The answer is no.

The ownership cost is for loan and lease

payments, the cost to acquiring the vehicle, and he just

18

doesn't have any payments of that type.

19

pretend that he does would create absurd results.

The trustees

What I'm saying, Your Honor,

is that there are many circumstances in which an expense

1

a threshold showing that it's applicable to you.

2

And if I could give the Court one example:

3

When an individual does his Federal income tax forms,

4

you can take a deduction for your dependents, but you

5

can't just take a deduction for any child you have.

6

have to take a deduction -- you can take a deduction if

7

the person lives at home with you for more than 1 year

8

and have you a certain amount of expenses to support

9

them, and that is a standard deduction that you get on

10

your tax forms.

out their actual costs.

The IRS doesn't ask everyone to figure

It is the case in real life that there are

13

allowance amounts that are average amounts that are

14

given to people once they meet the criteria.

15

what we are saying happens here.

16

And that's

Now, that is, again, only a disagreement as

17

to what you do with people who actually have vehicle

18

ownership expenses.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why aren't -- why isn't one

20

of the criteria the -- the provision that says maximum

21

allowances for housing and utilities and transportation,

22

known as the local standards, vary by location, and

23

unlike the national standards, the taxpayer is allowed

24

the amount actually spent or the standard, whichever is

25

less?

Why doesn't that apply?
45

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, because, Your Honor, in

2

that case it's the IRS commentary we are referring to

3

that's on page 1a of the red brief appendix.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.
And that -- what that's

6

referring to is -- it says the amount actually spent or

7

the standard.

8

amount that's actually spent or the standard, which is

9

the standard -­

And that's distinguishing between the

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MS. SAHARSKY:

12

Right.
-- amount in the table.

Right.

13

And of course, we look to what -- the text

14

that Congress enacted in the Bankruptcy Code, and that

15

says that the debtor's monthly expenses shall be the

16

debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts specified

17

under the national standards and local standards.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not applicable.

It's

19

not applicable if, in fact, you haven't spent that much.

20

Just as you claim it's not applicable if you have no

21

payment at all.

22

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think that it is -- it

23

would further Congress's purposes to say that you

24

have to -- that you look to the actual costs that the

25

debtor has.

But we just don't think the text goes that
46

Alderson Reporting Company

1

far, because it says that if the expense amounts -- the

2

category is applicable to the debtor, that then you use

3

the expense amounts specified under the table.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -­

No, but the -- but the

5

gravamen of Justice Scalia's question is:

running away from 1a, which is what Respondent's counsel

relied on?

Why are you

And if that were clearly relevant to this

Are you saying we -- we don't look at this

quoted?

Nothing at all?

It would not be relevant in

the bankruptcy context, in our view, and the reason is

because the -- the statutory text refers to the

scope is, as Justice Breyer was discussing with his

to construe.

2

do you say it's irrelevant in all instance -- in all

3

respects?

4

Do we then look at this language at 1a, or

MS. SAHARSKY:

You -- Your Honor, you could

5

look at this language, but we think that it reflects not

6

the standards, but what -- how the IRS uses the

7

standards in individual cases of tax delinquency.

8
9

To the extent that the IRS is defining what
the standards are, what the scope of the standards are

10

-- for example, that ownership costs are loan and lease

11

payments -- of course, we would think that you would

12

look to that, but this additional guidance to IRS agents

13

we don't think is what Congress meant when it said

14

"expense amounts specified under the standards."

15
16
17

But we do think that the text could be read
the way you suggest.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So then you would be

18

comfortable with a person who owns a house outright, who

19

only pays $100 in utilities, taking the full amount of

20

the housing and utilities allowable living expenses

21

because that's the amount specified?

22

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, the housing and

23

utilities expenses have been broken out into a mortgage

24

and rent component and a utilities component.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ms. Saharsky, I

12

should -- I should probably know this, but if you do

13

have amounts that are excluded from the disposable

14

income because of car ownership, in other words, you

15

actually have, from -- in your point of view, expenses,

16

do they have to go to the -- pay off the car loan or are

17

they available for everybody?

18

MS. SAHARSKY:

All the creditors?

They're not available for the

19

creditors.

The idea behind this calculation is that

20

there, of course, are secured debts that have priority,

21

and then this calculation is used to figure out how much

22

money is left to pay unsecured creditors.

23

is that the debtor has certain expenses, that he needs

24

to keep money for himself so he can continue with the

25

everyday business of life.

And the idea

For example, the car

49

Alderson Reporting Company

1

ownership payment is designed to ensure that a vehicle

2

can still use and have access to a car, and if someone

3

has a loan or lease payment, they need to be able to

4

continue making that payment in bankruptcy, but if they

5

don't have any such payment, then they don't have this

6

need for this additional fund because -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But can he decide -­

8

let's say he has more food expense than is allowed.

10

car payment that he's going to pay some of that for the

food expenses?

MS. SAHARSKY:

13

Bankruptcy Court doesn't scrutinize, you know, what

14

happens to that regard.

15

figure out the disposable income that is available to

16

pay unsecured creditors, that the debtor doesn't need.

What it's just trying to do is

17

And I should just note with respect to this

question of whether there is an overall budget that the
