CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument next in Case 07-463, Summers v. Earth Island

Institute.

Mr. Kneedler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit's affirmance of a

12

nationwide injunction in this case is contrary to

13

bedrock principles of Article III standing, of the

14

availability and scope of judicial review under the

15

Administrative Procedure Act, and the granting of

16

equitable relief.

17

district court and as it comes to this Court, it

18

involves a stand-alone challenge to two regulations that

19

govern the procedures to be followed by the Forest

20

Service in deciding whether to approve individual

21

site-specific activities in national forests.

22

As this case was decided by the

The two regulations provide that

23

site-specific actions that are excluded from either an

24

environmental impact requirement or even an EA under

25

NEPA are also not subject to special noticing and

comment and administrative appeal provisions applicable

to the Forest Service.

3

district court's nationwide injunction as to those

4

procedural regulations standing alone, not as part of a

5

challenge to a specific site-specific activity.

6

The Ninth Circuit sustained the

The court did so, moreover, on the basis of

7

an affidavit from one member of one of the organizations

8

who could not begin to establish standing under this

9

Court's decisions by showing an imminent injury by

10

virtue of harm to a site-specific activity; and the

11

Court affirmed the nationwide injunction applicable to

12

all forests with respect to all projects listed in ten

13

categories identified by the district court, including

14

national forests and projects that don't even -- that

15

are not even included within that one declarant's

16

generalized interests in certain natural forests.

17

For the multiple combination -- combination

18

of multiple reasons, we think the Ninth Circuit's

19

decision cannot stand.

20

First, as with respect to standing, the one

21

declaration on which both the district court and the

22

court of appeals rely is the declaration of Mr. Bensman,

23

which is reproduced in the petition appendix.

24

page 70A and 71A are the only allegations of -- that go

25

to injury at all with respect to the particular
4

Alderson Reporting Company

And on

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

regulations at issue here from paragraph 15 on to -- the

2

bottom of 71A on, those are allegations concerning other

3

regulations that are no longer at issue.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Standing itself, I mean,

5

it's a little unusual.

6

has passed a statute and the statute specifically aims

7

at a class of litigants.

8

litigants, if you are a member of it, we are telling you

9

what we want the agency to do and that is to promulgate

10

Suppose -- I mean, Congress here

And it says to the class of

a certain appeal procedure.

11

Now, if you are a member of the class that

12

frequently litigates and you frequently take advantage

13

of that procedure, why aren't you heard as a litigant,

14

at least enough for Article III?

15

prudential standing is concerned, Congress wanted to

16

give you standing, so I think would it take care of

17

that.

And we know as far as

18

Are you saying no matter -- that just normal

19

litigants in the courts who reappear time and time again

20

in certain kinds of cases, don't have standing to

21

challenge a procedural rule, if Congress under Article

22

III and Congress specifically tells them they can?

23
24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Congress has not specifically

said that they may challenge JUSTICE BREYER:

Let's imagine that Congress
5

did, Congress did say:

2

handled 17 tort cases in the last year where the value

3

has been more than $500,000 and who will sign an

4

affidavit saying they intend to continue in that branch

5

may appeal from the court's promulgation of the

6

following general rule, dah, dah, dah.

7

Constitution prohibits Congress from doing that?

8
9

MR. KNEEDLER:
think it could be lawyers.

10
11

By the way, lawyers who have

And that

Well, first of all, I don't
It has to be a party.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

Those who -- fine,

forget that, yeah.

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think there would be

13

substantial doubt that Congress could do that, because

14

let me explain why, and this goes to a point that

15

Justice Scalia was making in the prior argument.

16

Procedural wrong is not Article III injury.

17

The injury in this case comes from the application of

18

the regulation in a specific site-specific -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

You mean Article III and at

20

Westminster -- at Westminster, when Westminster,

21

whatever they had, they must have had some procedural

22

rules, and sometimes they had general procedural

23

rules -- I don't know what the history is; I could look

24

it up.

25

time or the clients who had certain cases were not

But I would be amazed if the lawyers at that

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

permitted to challenge those rules as contrary to some

2

other rules.

3

Do we know the answer to that?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In a particular case, I

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

6

Well, if -- if Congress -

suppose.

7

Generally.

8

Because you have a special procedure, here's what you

9

can generally challenge our rules.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, if I could make, again,

11

several points.

12

And there may be room in particular situations for

13

Congress to pass a special statute that would identify

14

particular interests that could then be taken into

15

account in terms of whether Article III standing would

16

be established.

17

Congress has not passed such a statute.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay, then your answer is,

18

if Congress says you can do it, have a general

19

challenge to people who generally appear, your answer is

20

if Congress says they could do it, Article III doesn't

21

stop them?

22
23
24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I -- what I said, that

would be a different question.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Ah.

What's the answer to

that different question?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it might depend on a

particular -- it might depend on a particular case.

3

they wouldn't eliminate the bedrock principle of

injury.

9

In

It would be necessary to show a threatened
Now, it JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Kneedler, don't we have

10

to assess the need for -- for showing a specific

11

threatened injury on a -- on a somewhat elastic standard

12

in a case like this?

13

other side that if we do not allow, if we do not find

14

standing to challenge the regulation per se, there are

15

going to be a number of specific instances which in

16

practical terms can never be challenged when that

17

regulation is applied.

18

Because the claim is made on the

There were one or two instances, as I

19

recall, of cases in which on your theory there could be

20

no challenge because the announcement of the action was

21

made on the very date that the action was taken.

22

that if we do not find sufficient elasticity and

23

standing to allow a challenge to the regulation on

24

behalf of people of the sort that Justice Breyer

25

described, there will, in fact, be a preclusion of any
8

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

challenge to a lot of specific actions.

2

What's your answer to that?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Several answers if I may.

4

the declaration on which standing was based in this

5

case, that claim is not made.

6

declaration that was made -- that was submitted before

7

the district court entered its judgment.

8

argument made like that after, after the fact.

9
10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In

And that is the only

There was an

Assume for the sake of

argument that it is made in this case.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Okay.

Then -

What should you respond?
It is conceivable in a

14

particular case that a person who -- who claims to be

15

injured by that could sue to prevent that injury, but it

16

would not be a challenge to the regulation as

17

regulation.

18

site-specific activities in which there would not be

19

notice given in advance or there wouldn't be -- wouldn't

20

be time, threatened to injure them.

21

challenge to the application -

22

It would be because specific, threatened,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It would again be a

But your response to that

23

is going to be, I presume, that in fact, absent a

24

specific activity before the court, the -- the challenge

25

is not ripe.

So that if you are going to stick to your
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

position elsewhere in this case, they are going to fail

2

in that enterprise.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

And -- and -- and that may -

4

that may well be right, but that would be a separate

5

question.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand -- I

7

don't understand your response.

If -- if someone has an

8

interest in -- in stopping a particular action that

9

would be governed by -- by -- by this general

10

regulation, surely that person could -- and is -- is -

11

is threatened proximately by that action, that person

12

could certainly bring an action seeking to stop the

13

action on the ground that this regulation is invalid.

14
15
16

MR. KNEEDLER:

That was my -- that was my -

and that was my point.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that would govern that

17

particular action, but it would also be -- be precedent

18

for invalidating the regulation in other cases.

19

presumably other courts would -- would similarly say

20

that the regulation is invalid.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

And that was the

22

point I was trying to make.

23

explain -- if I could explain the same point -

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I -

And if I -- if I could

May I ask -- may I ask

this one follow-up question, because I want to be sure I

Official - Subject to Final Review

understand your position.

2

his declaration cites three or four cases in which the

3

action was taken so promptly they didn't have notice in

4

order to object.

5

this was too fast for me.

6

just what the plaintiffs are trying to do in this case.

7

Would he have standing then?

8
9

Supposing the plaintiff in

And then he says but so -- they -- all
Now I want to -- want to do

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I -- if there was -- if

there was a category of cases in which that was likely

10

to happen.

11

have standing in that situation to challenge maybe an

12

upcoming -- it's an unusual APA suit because -- because

13

only final agency action can be challenged, but

14

conceivably a threatened final agency action -

15

Most of the -- most of the -- he may well

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You would agree that with

16

that scenario he would have standing if his only injury

17

in this is exactly the same as the plaintiff in this

18

case?

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

The injury would come

20

from the threatened on-the-ground activity, not the

21

actual -

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

He doesn't know that in

23

advance.

That is the premise of Justice Stevens's

24

question, and it is the premise of mine.

25

point is being made by them that this happened so fast
11
Alderson Reporting Company

There -- the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the threat has been realized before they could

2

respond to it.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

If -- if I -- if I could make

4

a broader point here because there -- there may be

5

certain categories, certain instances in which that

6

might happen, but it is -- it is the exception, not the

7

rule.

8
9

And -- and the JUSTICE SOUTER:

sake of argument it is the exception, not the rule.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12
13
14
15

I will -- I will assume for

the exceptional case.

But Let's assume we have got

Would there be standing?

MR. KNEEDLER:

In -- in the exceptional case

there probably would be standing.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that if in

16

Justice Stevens's hypo one could show that there had

17

been three or four or five instances of action so fast

18

it was impossible to challenge it, there would with that

19

as a predicate be standing to challenge the regulation

20

as these people are trying to challenge it?

21
22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Not -- no, and that -- and

that was the point I was -

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

Okay.
-- not -- not in the way they

are trying to challenge it, because they are trying to
12
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2
3
4

challenge it across the board.
JUSTICE SOUTER:
challenge it, then?

Tell us how they could

Tell us the right way?

MR. KNEEDLER:

What they would have to do is

5

bring a -- a -- on a -- a particular national forest

6

where a particular person visited and visited a

7

particular area and there has been a pattern of

8

particular activities that occurred without his knowing,

9

he -- he -- in that situation he might well have

10
11

standing to challenge a similar JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if it's the forest

12

next door that he is worried about and they have not

13

tried a -- a -- a kind of quickie lumbering action in

14

the forest next door before, he would not be able to

15

challenge it.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

The -- the

17

-- standing has to focus on the particular site-specific

18

place where the individual has visited and if there is a

19

repeated pattern of a similar type of activity that he

20

doesn't know about and maybe -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kneedler, why -- why

22

-- why is that so?

I am reading this ARA statute, and

23

it seems to give people a right to notice, an

24

opportunity to comment, and to undertake an

25

administrative appeal.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Why isn't this statute that says, interested

2

public, you have those rights, you have essentially a

3

right to a seat at the table, why isn't this statute

4

like FOIA, like the statute that the Court considered in

5

the Atkins case, in the FEC case involving information

6

about APAC?

7

These were people who said:

We are

8

concerned about saving our forests.

That's why Congress

9

said that before these actions occur, there should be

10

notice to the interested public, comment, and we are

11

being cut out from that seat at the table.

12

do us any good after the project has been authorized.

13

We want to be there when the decision is made to take

14

action.

MR. KNEEDLER:

limitations on agency action, but that doesn't mean that

18

-- that somebody can go into court and challenge agency

19

procedures as violative of the due process clause until

20

there is a specific proceeding going on and -- and

21

completed in which there has been a violation.

22

First of all, the due process clause imposes

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But this statute says

says before there is a specific action you have a right

24

to notice, comment, and administrative procedures.

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

There is no indication at all
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

in the passage of that statute that Congress meant to

2

confer a judicially enforceable right to obtain those

without complying with the usual APA provisions for

judicial review.

requirements cannot be eliminated by Congress?

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is -- that is correct.

15

And -- and there is no indication at all that in this

16

statute, which was just intended to modify the Forest

17

Service's intent to change its internal decision-making

18

processes -- and Congress wanted to restrict what -

19

what the Forest Service was going to do -- that it

20

thereby meant to change the fundamental nature of the

21

agency's own internal regulations which would not -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is that different

23

from FOIA?

I mean there anybody can request anything.

24

You don't have to show anything beyond -- well, you only

25

have to show curiosity.

You say:

The statute gives me

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a right to ask for this information.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well -- and the -- the Forest

3

Service has -- has procedures for notifying people of -

4

of proposed projects that were in fact invoked in this

5

case, and we point this out in our brief.

6

really two separate types of procedures.

7

There are

One is the so-called Schedule Of Proposed

8

Actions, which includes all the actions in which there

9

would be a decision memo issued by the Forest Service,

10

which includes at least all of the projects that

11

respondents are claiming should be -- should be covered.

12

That is published quarterly.

13

the web.

14

Respondents' declarants here on behalf of the Sierra

15

Club says that by using that so-called SOPA, that

16

schedule, he reviews every project in all 11 national

17

forests in California.

18

the SOPA -- and will submit comments when necessary.

19

It -- it is available on

It is also available in person.

One of

There is also, in addition to

In addition to the SOPA, the Forest Service

20

has what are called scoping regulations which -- in

21

which every on-the-ground project is looked at to see

22

whether it needs -- there needs to be NEPA compliance

23

through an EA or an EIS, but also what is the nature of

24

public participation that is required.

25

In that scoping process the Forest Service,
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the -- the local personnel at the Forest Service, will

2

look to see who is interested in the particular project.

3

The way this works on the ground is an organization like

4

the Sierra Club through its declarant in the -- in the

5

joint appendix will have somebody monitoring this SOPA,

6

the Schedule of Proposed Events, and will say:

7

that you have a -- a certain project listed.

8

interest in that.

9

to take action to thin this -- this area or restore this

10

burned area.

I see
I am

Please notify me when you are about

Please notify me.

11

When that happens, the Forest Service then

12

sends out a letter, a so-called scoping letter, asking

13

for comments.

14

-- the organizations of the declarants in this case have

15

been excluded.

16

who pay very, very close attention to what the Forest

17

Service is doing.

18

So this is not a situation in which the

To the contrary, these are all people

The one declarant on which the court of

19

appeals relied for standing on page 71a of the -- of the

20

petition appendix, he specifically refers -- the only

21

specific projects he refers to are timber projects, and

22

the injunction here goes much broader than timber

23

projects -- but he said that for example, in the

24

Allegheny National Forest they put out scoping comments

25

for a series of 20 timber sales.

He knew about those

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

timber sales and he was able to comment on them.

2

the -- the declarants on whom the standing was based to

3

challenge the Burnt Ridge Project, which is no longer in

4

this case, in that case the Forest Service -- and this

5

is in the administrative record -- sent out 1,300

6

letters to people who had expressed an interest in that

7

project before it was undertaken.

14

So this is not an instance in which -- in

2

which notice is not generally furnished.

3

I would like to make the same point I was

4

making about standing in connection with the -- with the

5

Administrative Procedure Act as well.

6

the -- of the APA says that a person who is aggrieved by

7

agency action is -- may seek judicial review thereof.

8

The -- the agency action that is subject to judicial

9

review has to be the agency action that causes the

Section 702 of

10

injury.

The procedural regulation does not cause the

11

injury.

It is the on-the-ground activity, the

12

site-specific decision -- the action, the agency action

13

approving the site-specific action that causes the

14

injury.

15

review on.

16

That is what the person is entitled to judicial

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then you are saying that

17

this statute is just unenforceable, because the statute

18

is supposed to operate before the project?

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's -- it's -- it's by no

20

means unenforceable.

In the Burnt Ridge Project that

21

was at issue in this -- in this case, the plaintiffs

22

challenged the Burnt Ridge Project when it was completed

23

on a number of grounds, that it was not properly

24

categorically excluded from NEPA, that it didn't comply

25

with the forest plan, but also that it had been approved
19
Alderson Reporting Company

without complying with the -- with the ARA appeals

2

procedures.

3
4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that was before

the project was undertaken?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

An injunction, a

6

preliminary injunction was obtained, and tellingly, and

7

I think this is also instructive for ripeness purposes,

8

there was a PI issued but not because of a violation of

9

the -- of the ARA; the district court concluded there

10

was a likelihood of success on some of these other

11

objections, substantive objections to the project, not

12

procedural objections -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Ah, but -- and enjoined it and then

15

the Forest Service went through the project and the -

16

and the plaintiffs dropped their challenge.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I am pursuing this, but

18

I'm actually having a hard time with this.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Kneedler, I don't even

And that's the way you make it -- make it

kind of notice other than this sort of situation where a

project is going -- is going to take place, the only

15

other form of notice is publication in a local newspaper

this is -- that this notice provision is localized with

8

could certainly challenge it?

10

fact that in all of its cases the agency is doing this

11

thing that is wrong.

12

Will you have standing to challenge that?

The question of rightness in

standing need to be treated a little differently for

that. As far as the rightness question I think it would

the standing calculation?

relied on it at least as an alternative ground, correct?

most of the discussion was about the procedural harms

that the parents of the autistic school children were

suffering.

to the concrete harm, but it did tie it to the concrete

harm.

And I think that's what the Ninth Circuit did

24

here.

And certainly the district court very much went

25

into tying the procedural harm to the on the ground

There was only one brief sentence tying it

harm, and that's what it based its decision on.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, to read

3

just one sentence to you from the National Wildlife

4

Federation case, because I think it's the biggest hurdle

5

you face.

It's on page 15 of the government's brief.

6

It says:

"A regulation is not ordinarily consider the

7

type of agency action ripe for judicial review under the

8

APA until the scope of the controversy has been reduced

9

to more manageable proportions and it's factual

10

components flushed out by some concrete action applying

11

the regulation to the claimant's situation."

12
13

It seems like a high hurdle for you to
surmount.

14

MR. KENNA:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that

15

needs to be read in combination with the footnote 2 to

16

that decision, which says of course if you have a

17

regulation applying a particular measure across the

18

board

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's the Abbott

20

Labs exception, isn't it?

21

suggests that that is applicable here.

22

MR. KENNA:

I don't think anybody

No, I don't think that's the --

23

where the plaintiff cannot show that the regulation has

25

been applied to its situation yet.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's when his

primary conduct is nonetheless going to be affected?

3

MR. KENNA:

Right.

You know, the drug

5

companies have to do something.

6

have to wait until they are sent to jail to say that

9

MR. KENNA:

Yes.

Well, they don't -- you
-- they don't

But I think where as here

10

the regulation has been applied to the plaintiffs on an

11

ongoing basis, it's conceded that it was applied

12

thousands of times nationwide.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you have not

14

pointed to a particular fact under any of these

15

affidavits when it was applied to any of the plaintiffs.

16

In what the National Wildlife Federation case said,

17

"Some concrete action applying the regulation to the

MR. KENNA:

MR. KENNA:

If you show standing with

No, Your Honor, I would

respectfully say that the focus is on the beginning.

10

And then as the -- as this Court said last term in Davis

v. FEC, then it becomes a matter of mootness, and

12

between that case and the Laidlaw case, that is a lower

13

hurdle.

14

Marderosian declaration is worth looking at, because it

15

talks about harm from the Burnt Ridge Project itself,

16

which the government concedes, as well as from

17

application of the regulations to be denied notice,

18

comment and appeal throughout the Sequoia National

read what the Chief Justice quoted?

25

MR. KENNA:

What

Well, the footnote 2 says, of

Alderson Reporting Company

course, if you have a particular regulation applied to a

2

particular -- to a category of circumstances across the

3

board, of course you may challenge it.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I think

Is that all it says?

No, I

5

think it speaks of categories across the board that

6

affect

7

person complaining of the regulation, which is the case

8

in these areas where you have a regulation requiring

9

drug companies to have certain -- on pain of criminal

-- that immediately, concretely affect the

10

penalty to print certain things on labels.

11

immediately affects them.

12

That

I think that is what footnote 2 is about,

13

not about -- not about any regulation that is across the

14

board.

That wouldn't make any sense.

15

Where is footnote 2.

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. KENNA:

Let's read it.

There is many cases where it was

18

not an effect on primary conduct yet a facial challenge

19

was permitted.

20

before a facial challenge to a regulation that is

21

published in the Code of Federal Regulations where it

22

has been applied on an ongoing basis.

23

In fact, this Court has never rejected

So, in Sullivan v. Zebley, it was child

24

disability benefits, it was a benefit referring

25

regulation, which said we see no reason to force as
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

applied challenges instead of a facial challenge.

2

You have Thomas v. Union Carbide, which was

3

not a regulation telling Union Carbide how it had to

4

manufacture its pesticides, but rather how it would

5

affect arbitration -- it's arbitration when it got into

6

disputes, which is like National Park's case, which was

7

held unright not because of that fact, but because it

8

had not yet been applied.

9

When you look at all of these cases that

10

rejects facial challenge where either the regulation has

11

been applied and has not

12

the question of whether it affects primary conduct.

13

-- and then the court gets to

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem they are asking

14

you on this -- it was at least a problem for me

-- I

15

think it's tough on rightness is because the government

16

is saying here:

17

the context of a particular action that you don't like.

18

Well, there's never going to be an action, never going

19

to be such an action that we are going to take that you

20

won't find out about, that you will not be able to

21

challenge in that context if you are really hurt.

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the appendix, even apart from the assertion that there

2

are -- the fact that there are certain actions that will

3

receive no notice, I think the fact of the matter is we

4

did what the court has instructed us to do, and that is

5

we brought a facial challenge in a concrete example with

6

the Burnt Ridge timber sale project.

7

Now it becomes a question of mootness, and I think the

8

mootness question is easier to solve because the Court

9

has said that it's a lesser hurdle than standing, and we

Now, it's passed.

10

have shown through the Bensman declaration that it's

11

continuing to be applied to the plaintiffs on an ongoing

12

basis, that they suffer harm by not being able to get

13

these procedures which caused them on-the-ground harm

14

because the forest is not protected as well as it would

15

be with it.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I now have

17

footnote 2, and it refers, as you say, to a particular

18

measure that applies across the board to all individual

19

classifications.

20

"and has become ripe for review in the manner we

21

discussed in the text." Then we say, or Justice Scalia

22

says, "it can of course be challenged under the APA by a

23

person adversely affected.

24

the effect when they get a general decision invalidating

25

a program, it says that a quite different from

It goes on to say, which is final,

And although that may have

35
Alderson Reporting Company

permitting a generic challenge to all aspects of the

2

program as though that itself constituted a final agency

3

action."

4

So you still have to become ripe for review

5

in the manner discussed, which was the sentence that I

6

read to you earlier, and the challenge can only be

7

brought by a person adversely affected.

8

footnote 2 undermines the sentence I have read to you at

9

all.

10

MR. KENNA:

I don't see how

Well, in that footnote, it's

11

15

facts to sort through and apply, but the opinion in Ohio

16

Forestry said, of course, though, if the plan had cut

17

out someone's right to object to trees being cut, that

18

would be the kind of action that would be challengeable.

And so I think what that later part is talking about, in

20

action we allow challenges to.

22

23

And I think that was the problem in Ohio

It's not final agency

It's not CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it says -- it

24

says, if it's become ripe for review in the manner

25

discussed in text.

In other words, if it has been
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

applied to a particular individual adversely affected

2

then, quote, "a person adversely affected may bring a

3

challenge. " And I don't -- that seems to me to be a

4

restatement of the sentence I read you earlier.

5

MR. KENNA:

But that gets us to the standing

6

question.

And here the Marderosian declaration showed

7

he was affected both with regard to the Burnt Ridge

8

Project and other projects on the Sequoia National

9

Forest.

We have the Bensman declaration that talks

10

about how he was harmed in his local forest from not

11

being able to comment on timber sales, and we have the

12

subsequent declarations.

13

And I would also point out in the Lujan v.

14

Defenders case, both in the note 8 and Justice Kennedy's

15

concurrence, there's a discussion about how, in

16

Robertson v. Methow Valley, for instance, a standing

17

declaration didn't even need to be raised because it was

18

obvious that,

19

amongst the injured because they were a local group in

20

their local forest.

21

in that case, that the plaintiffs were

That's the general program.

Well, all I can say, Your Honor,

is I thought we did that by bringing it in the context
of the Burnt Ridge sale and then it's a matter of JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you had had a ruling

12

on where you draw the line in the Burnt Ridge case, then

13

that would have been precedent for all these other

14

cases, but it was settled, right, so you didn't get a

15

determination?

16

MR. KENNA:

Yes, Your Honor, we never

17

brought an as-applied challenge to these regulations in

18

the context of the Burnt Ridge sale.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you are seeking a

20

different line.

21

line is that you are seeking.

Now, that is exempt, not because it's environmentally

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

(Laughter.)

17

MR. KENNA:

Oh.

I think the other kinds of cases

18

that are useful to look at are, for instance, Blum v.

19

Yaretsky for standing, and that was the nursing home

20

case where nursing home residents that had been denied

21

-- they had been sent to lesser nursing home facilities,

22

they were on assistance -- challenged the way in which

23

that was being handled.

24

the historical basis for these plaintiffs is that they

25

have been denied their -- they have been in these

And the Court said, you know,

to be in again.

Florida Chapter of Contractors v. Jacksonville case,

4

which I am afraid we did not put in our brief, but that

5

was where victims of reverse discrimination had been

6

regular bidders on construction contracts, and they were

7

held to have standing because it was obvious they were

8

going to suffer these harms again and there was not even

9

a discussion of the declarations.

10

Another case would be the Northeastern

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Here, we -

That's not unusual.

I

11

mean, standing looks not just to harm that has already

12

been suffered but to harm that is imminent.

13

these people are regular bidders and they say, you know,

14

I'm likely to bid on this next project, that's fine.

15

But these people are -- you don't know any specific

They are just people interested in forests

MR. KENDALL:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's quite different from

20

saying, "I am about to suffer harm, imminent harm, to

21

me."

22

in the case that was settled that has that kind of a

23

connection.

24
25

I don't see anything -- you know, anything except

MR. KENNA:

Well, Justice Scalia, I would

suggest that the way those two cases I discussed the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

plaintiffs were treated is similar to here, where you

2

have members who -- it's uncontroverted that they are

3

constantly using the national forests and commenting on

4

forest appeals.

5

timber sales.

6

always been this Court's jurisprudence to elevate form

7

-- I mean, elevate substance over form -- so it's not a

8

creative pleading exercise that can either get you in or

9

out of standing; it's a commonsense inquiry.

10

And we have a reference to 20 specific
They weren't mentioned by name, but it's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Tell me the two cases again

11

that you are relying on for this.

12

MR. KENNA:

Blum v. Yaretsky, and that we

13

cite in our brief; and then Northeastern Florida Chamber

of Contractors v. Jacksonville.

15

That's a 1993 case.

And what's that?

What's

the cite for it?

there had not yet been an arbitration under the federal

insecticide law.

Court, there had been an arbitration that had passed,

5

and on that basis the Court said yes, this is a ripe

6

controversy because here it's been applied, and there

7

was no finding of mootness even though that arbitration

8

was done, and that's the same situation that we have

9

here.

11

But by the time the case came to the

JUSTICE BREYER:
for a minute.

12

MR. KENNA:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Can I go back to standing

Yes, Your Honor.
You may have looked this up

and may have found something here.

15

Suppose an organization that has a purely

16

ideological interest, so it can't get into Federal

17

court, nonetheless can go before an agency; but they are

18

not going to get into Federal court.

19

agency then has a reg that they think is lawful and

20

makes their life more difficult.

21

that they suffer a procedural injury would not get them

22

into court.

23

don't.

24
25

Now, suppose that

I guess that the fact

They are already somebody who doesn't; they

So I can imagine cases saying that.
Contrast that with the case with a person

who has a very concrete specific injury, a terrible
43
Alderson Reporting Company

allergy to chemical X, and they often litigate that

2

there is too much chemical X, and now they are before an

3

agency and they frequently complain about chemical X,

4

but they don't have a particular case, but they will

5

often be there.

6

procedural regulation that hurts those people who

7

normally have a concrete injury.

8

wonder if that purely procedural injury cannot serve as

9

a basis for standing.

10

Now, the agency promulgates a

All right?

There I

Now, do the cases ask -- so I am contrasting

11

the two kinds of questions, and I wonder what you found

12

in the cases as to the second kind, as opposed to the

first kind; and you are free to answer this as one word

"nothing; go look it up yourself, which is a fair

comment.

of course our case is not that typical because we think

19

we have on the -

20
21
22

JUSTICE BREYER:

You think you are like the

second?
MR. KENNA:

Right.

I think there is room

under the -- so the FEC v. Atkins cases is the

Then there is the Havens

redlining in loaning for -- discriminatorily loaning in

2

neighborhoods had organizational standing, not

3

representational as we claim here through our members,

4

but actual representation in and of themselves.

5

think when you combine those cases together, I think

6

there is some room for that finding that there is that

7

injury.

And I

8

But I would -- I would point out here that

9

the -- we don't claim it, and even though the court of

10

appeals, again, talks quite a bit about it, it

11

ultimately tied it back.

12

that this Court found to be sufficient, I think the

13

focus really has to be on the district court, as that is

14

what originally looked at the declarations and did a

15

very good job of discussing the on-the-ground injuries

16

suffered combined with procedural injuries.

17

And even if it didn't do a job

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I ask you about

18

Northeastern Florida?

19

think it -- it supports what you say.

20

what was going on here is that there was a -- a minority

21

business preference adopted by the City of Jacksonville,

22

and some contractors who were not minorities sued saying

23

that this was in -- in violation of the Constitution.

24
25

I have dug that out.

I don't

In its complaint

And what happened -- what the Court said
about standing was in its complaint petitioner alleged
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that many of its members regularly bid on and perform

2

construction works.

3

might fit your case, but then it went on to say, "and

4

that they would have bid on designated set-aside

5

contracts but for the restrictions imposed."

6

Now, if it had stopped there it

As I read the case there were designated

7

contracts, of which they said we would have bid on them

8

but we didn't because of this -- what the case involved

9

was the assertion by the city that you don't have

10

standing unless you can show you would have been awarded

11

the contract.

12

awarded it, but if indeed you were -- you would have

13

been a bidder in that contract but for this law, that's

14

enough for standing.

And we said, no, no, you don't have to be

15

So that's not this case.

16

MR. KENNA:

But I think the record supports

17

the same kind of assertion.

18

look at Tim Bensman's declaration at page 71a of the

19

petition appendix, it says how on those timber sales he

20

would have commented and appealed them if he was given

21

the opportunity, and he would like to go back there if

22

he could preserve the quality of those areas that he

23

visited.

24
25

So, for instance, if you

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
"there"?

And where is

He would like to go back where?
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KENNA:

He would like to go back to the

2

areas in -- where those 20 timber sales are, some of

3

which he had been to before and would like to return to.

4

And I -- and the supplemental declarations, when this

5

came up again and the government pressed, because they

6

asked for more specifics, those specifics were provided.

7

And so, for instance, at the joint appendix

8

at page 90 you have Eric Wiberg using the Weiser River

9

drainage and talking about he wasn't going to get notice

10

of that.

Only because he happened to be personally

11

familiar with the area was he able to communicate his

12

views to the Forest Service, and it actually ended up

13

changing what the Forest Service did because he just

14

happened to find out and he happened to know it.

15

that's a specific -

16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This isn't one of

those after-submitted declarations, is it?

18
19

So

MR. KENNA:
referred to is.

20

That -- that latest one I

Yes, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, don't we

21

generally not look at after-submitted declarations in

22

determining standing?

23

MR. KENNA:

Your Honor, I don't think that

24

is correct.

I think the Court can look at any documents

25

in the record which show standing at the time of the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suit.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you -- if

3

yesterday you submitted a declaration, we would look at

4

that?

5

MR. KENNA:

Well, the cases that the

6

government provided for rejecting declarations were

7

offers submitted to this Court or certainly an appellate

8

court and I agree that is more problematic, or it would

9

have been more problematic if the district court had

10

excluded the documents and said it's not going to look

11

at them.

12

standard as was at issue in Lujan v National Wildlife

13

Federation.

14

takes up a record from a district court it is entitled

15

to look at all the evidence submitted and especially

16

when it's a case like standing -- or an issue like

17

standing where it's a constitutional question that is

18

important and you may look at all the circumstances -

19

there is no reason to reject a later filed declaration.

20
21

We would be looking at an abuse of discretion

But certainly when a, an appellate court

But again, we don't rely on those alone.
think it's the totality of everything that supports -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The later filed,

23

where along the district court proceedings were they

24

filed?

25

We

MR. KENNA:

They were submitted -- after the
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judgment setting aside the regulations, there was

2

litigation over the government's stay motion pending

3

appeal.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you lose that

5

again, you figure, well, I've got some more -- I can get

6

some more declarations.

7

after-submitted declarations is because there has to be

8

under the normal rule, an end to litigation at a

9

particular time.

It seems to me this would be an

10

endless process.

You know, every time the district

11

court identifies a particular flaw, you would say okay,

12

here's a declaration, and then they say, well, here's

13

another basis, well, here's another declaration.

14

not sure that that's what our cases sanction.

15

MR. KENNA:

The reason we don't look at

I'm

Well, the -- the district court

16

didn't find a flaw.

17

was -- the government reiterated its standing argument

18

in the context of the stay.

19

door by arguing again, "hey, you have no standing," in

20

addition to "we should get a stay because of the

21

equities."

22

that circumstance to submit additional declarations.

23

didn't just file them out of the blue because we

24

thought -

25

It found that we had standing.

It

This essentially opened the

And so it seems perfectly appropriate in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
49
Alderson Reporting Company

We

You filed them after

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

judgment, right?
MR. KENNA:

We did.

But they -- I think

3

also the issue is there's been the many decisions of the

4

Court which say, you know, standing after the fact isn't

5

going to do you any good.

6

important to keep clear here is that the declarations

7

were later filed, but they referred to events going on

8

before the judgment came down.

9

And what I think it's

So, we have declarations at the time of the

10

complaint, very specific; the government concedes they

11

are very specific; they talked about both the Burnt

12

Ridge sale and the regulation.

13

declaration at the time of the merits consideration,

14

which showed the case was not moot, that he was still

15

being subjected to these regulations and being denied

16

notice and comment.

17

declarations after the fact of the government -- I'm

18

sorry of the district court's decision, which buttressed

19

all of the above.

20

We have the Bensman

And then we have additional

And it seems appropriate under that

21

circumstance in light of the statements by the Court

22

that I discussed in the Defenders case and elsewhere,

23

that standing is a practical inquiry, that standing

24

should be found in such circumstances.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you want to say a word

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about the Ninth Circuit making a law for the entire

2

nation, on a controversial question that normally the

3

court would just rule for its own area?

4

MR. KENNA:

Well, I think there is a

5

difference, Your Honor, between setting aside a

6

regulation under the Administrative Procedure Act and

7

what would normally be some sort of nationwide

8

injunction such as where you had, say, challenged a

9

local timber -- local forest service district for not

10

analyzing NEPA correctly, and the Court not only set

11

aside that action but said, and "oh, by the way anywhere

12

else in the country that's doing it like this, you are

13

enjoined, too."

14

I think it's a very different question where

15

you have a regulation that's being challenged under the

16

APA.

17

setting aside a regulation, which the APA commands a

18

district court to do, also using its discretion, means

19

that it is set aside without geographic limitation.

20

so I think, you know, the Ninth Circuit may have said a

21

bit much to saying it was compelled by the text of the

22

APA but I do believe the district court properly weighed

23

the Mendoza interests.

And it's always been the Court's assumption that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5
6

Mr. Kneedler, you

MR. KNEEDLER:

Several points, Mr. Chief

Justice.

7

First, the Burnt Ridge Project illustrates

8

the way that we think an issue like this should be

9

resolved and shows why the sentence from National

10

Wildlife Federation that you quoted, Mr. Chief Justice,

11

disposes of the case, and that is that a regulation -

12

particularly a procedural regulation whose only

13

relevance is in an agency proceeding for approving a

14

site-specific activity -- that can only be challenged in

15

connection with that site-specific activity.

16

what the sentence in National Wildlife Federation was

17

driving at; that is what Section 702 says; when you can

18

challenge the agency action that aggrieves you and that

19

is consistent with what the Court said in National

20

Wildlife Federation, that a -- a court should intervene

21

only when and to the extent that someone is harmed.

22

This regulation can only harm someone in connection

23

with -

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's

That is not what it says.

It says this is our ordinary practice it doesn't say

MR. KNEEDLER:

4
5
6

He was talking about

I was talking about JUSTICE STEVENS:

I thought you were talking

about MR. KNEEDLER:

-- ripeness under the APA but

7

it ties in -- it ties into the injunctive relief if I

8

just could address that for a moment.

9

Injunctive relief is -- is discretionary and

10

Section 702 of the APA says nothing in the statute limit

11

a court's ability to deny relief on appropriate

12

equitable grounds.

13

-- suppose a regulation was challenged by the defendant

14

in a criminal conviction and the plaintiff says the

15

regulation is invalid on its face.

16

aside, but surely the district court dismissing that

17

indictment would not be setting aside the regulation on

18

a nationwide basis.

19

judgment even one rendered in the course of dismissing

20

an indictment, if you call that a declaration, is -- is

21

governed by the law of judgments, not by -- not by a

22

court reaching out and extending its ruling to people

23

and forests and projects that are not before -- not

24

before the Court.

25

And this is best illustrated by the

The APA says set it

The effect of a declaratory

And the Burnt Ridge Project shows the way in
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which this could be challenged.

2

where there was not an appeal, if someone wants to

3

object to the project on that ground or any other

4

ground, he -- he can challenge that project, and there

5

may be other grounds on which that project might be

6

invalid which is an additional reason not to anticipate

7

a legal defect but to -- but to wait until it's applied.

8

The final thing I wanted to say is about the

9

A particular project

claim of procedural injury and that this might be like

10

FOIA or something like this.

11

that the -- that the ARA is not written in terms of

12

conferring rights on individuals.

13

the Forest Service to prepare a -- to establish an

14

appeal mechanism, in other words, do what the agency

15

normally does to establish procedures for administering

16

things.

17

suggests that it was intended to confer the

18

extraordinary sort of right of immediate access to the

19

court for purely procedural grounds.

20

to fine-tune the agency's own internal administrative

21

procedures, which Section 706 of the APA makes clear can

22

only be challenged in a challenge to the final agency

23

action in which the procedures are applied.

24
