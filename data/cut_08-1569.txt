CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Horwich.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN HORWICH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. HORWICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Section 924(c)(1) starts by defining a

11

single crime of using or carrying a firearm during and

12

in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking

13

crime.

14

Next, it addresses sentencing, and it does

15

that by giving the judge some rules to channel his

16

discretion in particular cases, and among those is a

17

requirement that a, quote, "person convicted of a

18

violation" ... "shall be sentenced" to a greater minimum

19

sentence when the firearm is of a particular type.

20

And -JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

Well wait.

There's --

22

there's some sentencing stuff in -- in the first part

23

as well.

24

say that (A) deals only with elements and (B) deals

25

with sentencing.

There's sentencing stuff in (A).

3
Alderson Reporting Company

You can't

1

MR. HORWICH:

Well, no, and, of course --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, (A) says, "shall be

3

sentenced to 5 years."

4

So there's sentencing stuff in (A).

5

MR. HORWICH:

Or to 7 years, or to 10 years.

Well, I agree with you that

6

the phrase "be sentenced" certainly appears in (A) as

7

well.

8

particular sentence, it's going to use those words.

To the extent a statute is going to direct a

9

But I think the -- we're relying a lot

10

more on the language in the beginning of subparagraph (B),

11

that says, "if the firearm possessed by a person convicted

12

of a violation," which necessarily presupposes, then, that

13

there has been a conviction --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So does -- so does the language

15

of (A)(ii) and (A)(iii), which is the same language:

16

the firearm is brandished"; "if the firearm is

17

discharged" -- they all apply to a conviction for carrying

18

the firearm.

19

things apply.

20
21

"if

There has to be a conviction before those

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I agree.

That's true.

That is certainly an accurate statement -JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

So that makes (A) the same

23

as (B).

And -- and you don't claim that the elements in (A)

24

are just sentencing elements, do you?

25

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I certainly don't claim
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that they -- that the elements in the principal

2

paragraph of (A) are.

3

trying to make is that, with respect to firearm type,

4

which is at issue here, is that the firearm type

5

provisions are introduced by specific language that

6

says -- that tells the reader these are relevant to a

7

person convicted of a violation; these are not relevant

8

to whether --

9
10

The point I'm -- the point I'm

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, but you're

forgetting the words of this subsection.

11

MR. HORWICH:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean --

Well --- the subsection would be

13

(B) itself.

14

you get -- I'm sorry -- a short-barrel rifle, et cetera,

15

you get 10 years.

16

If you're convicted of carrying a machinegun,

If it's a machinegun, you get 30.

What's -- what's irrational about reading

17

the statute that way when it uses the word "subsection"?

18

It didn't use "subparagraph."

19

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I agree it doesn't use

20

"subparagraph."

21

conventional use in drafting would refer actually to

22

924(c) as a whole.

23

And "subsection" certainly in

But -- but looking to the word "this

24

subsection," Justice Sotomayor, is not -- is not useful

25

for distinguishing among the elements and the sentencing

1

factors, because of course there are, I think --

2

certainly this Court's holding in Harris says that the

3

brandishing and the discharge provisions are sentencing

4

factors.

5

They are part of this subsection.
All the courts of appeals have held, and

6

it's the entirely natural inference of the recidivism

7

provisions in subparagraph (C), which is also part of

8

this subsection, are -- are themselves sentencing

9

factors.

So saying that something is in this subsection

10

means that it might be part of a violation doesn't

11

actually answer what is or is not part of the violation

12

versus --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But still and all, if -- if

14

Congress were being precise and if the statute is to be

15

read the way you suggest, the introduction to capital

16

(B) should have been "if the firearm possessed by a

17

person convicted of a violation of paragraph (A) above,"

18

and then pick it up, "is," so forth.
Right?

19
20
21

I mean, that would -- would be more

precise.
MR. HORWICH:

That -- that I think would be so

22

precise that we wouldn't be here discussing it today.

23

agree with that.

24
25

I

But, of course, Congress has also used that
same reference to "subsection" throughout -- throughout the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

entire statute, even if it's not being used in the most

2

precise sense, in the sense that a violation of this

3

subsection appears in subparagraph (C), it appears in

4

subparagraph (D), which is not --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

-- which is not then to say that

7

this subsection -- that everything in this subsection is an

8

element.

9

The Court has held otherwise already.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess I agree with you

10

that if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be an

11

element, too.

12

MR. HORWICH:

Well, that certainly would be

13

the inference.

14

traditional treatment of recidivism.

15

And that would be quite contrary to the

But, more generally, the tradition that

16

Congress is working within in this new statute -- which,

17

I want to point out, is significantly different in -- in

18

a very substantive way from the old statute -- that the

19

new statute proscribes a statutory maximum of life in

20

all cases.

21

old statute --

22

That is different from the old statute.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

What is this to do -- I

23

mean, the obvious question, to me, is -- since I wrote

24

the -- I think I wrote the opinion in Castillo -- is we

25

looked at the language of the statute, very similar to
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this, and we said:

2

And they recodified it.

3

they did was take the things that we previously said

4

were separate crimes and put them in (B), and take the

5

things that are obviously sentencing factors and put

6

them in (A) and (C).

7

Machinegun means a separate crime.

All right.

And it looks to me as if all

Now, that's what it looks like

8

if you just read the statute.

9

the history that suggested any other intent.

10
11

I didn't find anything in
So why do

you think that that change makes the difference?
MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think there are --

12

there are several specific changes that Congress made.

13

And I think it would be, perhaps, useful to look at the

14

old statute and the new one, the old statute and the new

15

one together and see why the things that -- that the

16

Court said in Castillo are gone in the new one.

17

old statute is in the petition appendix at 11a.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. HORWICH:

So the

Right.

And then the new statute is in

20

the appendix to the government's opening brief at 1a and

21

2a, so you can look at them side by side.

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't the old one in your

brief, too, in your --

24

MR. HORWICH:

It is.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's 3a of the government's
8

Alderson Reporting Company

brief.

2
3

MR. NORWICH:

It is, although, of course,

you have to turn the page, and I --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. HORWICH:

All right.

Okay.

Perhaps it's helpful to look

6

at them next to each other, because the differences are

7

quite stark --

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. HOWICH:

10

All right.

-- when you do that.

So the first thing is, as you suggested,

11

Justice Breyer, the firearm type provisions were moved.

12

But I think that that move signals something contrary to

13

what this Court had perceived in Castillo.

14

the firearm type provisions were part of the initial

15

sentence that defined the elements.

16

rolling along, talking about using or carrying a

17

firearm, and then in the same breath it goes on to start

18

talking about specific weapons.

19

reading of Castillo, drove the Court's impression that

20

the they -- that the machinegun provision there should be

21

an element.

22

In Castillo,

The sentence is

And that is what, in my

The difference in the new statute is -- is

23

that Congress has moved it away, textually,

24

conceptually, structurally, away from the elements,

25

which ought to suggest that Congress doesn't think -9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it didn't.

It kept

2

in (A) the subdivisions of use and brandishing, which

3

we all agree are elements of the crime.

4

what it means to say that it moved it away from the

5

elements.

6

factors, and so what we have to discern was, did it

7

intend to make (B) sentencing factors or not?

8
9

So I don't know

It mixed up in (A) elements and sentencing

And I think what Justice Breyer was asking
you:

What in the legislative history shows that?

Where

10

do we read, outside of Castillo, a conclusion that

11

somehow Congress radically changed the assumptions we

12

identified in Castillo, which is historically it's not a

13

sentencing element?

14

MR. HORWICH:

15

First of all, in the new -- in the new

So a few answers there.

16

structure of the statute, on the government's view, the

17

elements finish in the principal paragraph, and then --

18

then we're into sentencing factors.

19

discharge were held in Harris and acknowledged in Dean

20

to be sentencing factors.

21

point, on to sentencing factors.

22

So brandishing and

So we are sort of, at that

So I take from what this Court said in

23

Harris, about the separation of brandishing and discharge

24

from the elements in the principal paragraph to indicate

25

that they are sentencing factors, would apply even more

strongly to subparagraph (C), which is even farther

away.

a new sentence.

4

certainly complete.

5

other sentencing factors, and now we're --

There's -- there's a period, a structural break,

6

The thought in the principal paragraph is
We've already been through some

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, except that with --

7

with (C), you -- you could say that traditionally

8

recidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot

9

say with respect to (B) that whether it's a

10

short-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally

11

been a sentencing factor.

12

element.

13

MR. HORWICH:

To the contrary, it was an

Well, I disagree with that,

14

Justice Scalia, because the tradition, as I understand

15

it, is relevant because it might indicate what Congress

16

was thinking or what suppositions it had in mind when it

17

passed a statute.

18

And there's a very -- there was a very

19

different tradition at the time of the 1986 enactment of

20

the old statute and the 1998 enactment of the new one,

21

which is -- the big difference is that the sentencing

22

guidelines came into effect in between those two times.

23

And the sentencing guidelines -- sentencing

24

guideline 2K2.1, the principal determinant of base

25

offense level in the sentencing guidelines for
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

firearm-centric offenses in the Federal criminal law, was

2

firearm type.

3

unmistakable at the time in 1998 when Congress enacted

4

these -- these firearm-type provisions, that the

5

sentencing guidelines were already making firearm type a

6

sentencing consideration for the judge.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it was unmistakably that -- it was

Let's -- let's talk about

8

the guidelines.

9

guidelines would provide for a much shorter sentence,

10
11

Without the application of (B), the

wouldn't they?
MR. HORWICH:

Well, the guidelines -- as

12

before and as now for this offense, the guidelines level

13

is the minimum.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The guidelines -- do you

15

think that if under the guidelines the sentence was

16

30 years because of a machinegun, do you think that that

17

would be upheld?

18
19
20

MR. HORWICH:

I'm sorry.

And your -- if I

understand you -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think it would be

21

upheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan

22

theory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied?

23

MR. HORWICH:

A reasonable -- well,

maximum is specified to be life.
MR. HORWICH:

Where is that specified?

textually in the statute, but all courts that have looked

13

at this have understood that.

14

the supposition of this Court's statutory holding in Harris

that the nature of -- the structure of this -- of the

16

sentencing provision here is that there's a life maximum,

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is there a Sixth

Amendment problem with reading a statute this way,

But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover

minimums are treated like the maximums for Apprendi

purposes, should we reset the case for argument?

my disagreement with Justice Scalia, if you accept that

the statutory maximum is life, as I believe every court

statute belongs to an entirely different tradition than

17

the tradition that Castillo belonged to, which is to

say that this statute -- the -- the role of firearm type

in this statute is to channel the sentencing judge's

discretion by ruling out certain low sentences when

certain facts are present, such as the presence of a

MR. HORWICH:

I disagree with that because

8

the principle -- the background -- the basic principle

9

behind Apprendi and our criminal law is that what you

can rely on is what Congress has said in the statute or

11

in -- as Booker holds --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What you can rely on in

13

an indeterminate sentencing regime without a minimum is

14

that you've got a statutory maximum, whatever it may

15

be, but a judge's discretion to start from zero.

16

that judge was inclined to give you zero, isn't the

17

minimum then your statutory maximum?

that's what the judge has to give you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18
19
20

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Fisher.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think it's important at the outset to set

21

the context for this case.

The government cannot point

22

to a single defendant under this provision for the

23

conduct at issue who has ever received more than

24

10 years in prison absent the use of a machinegun.

25

We cited a long string of cases in the
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

O'Brien brief and the government's response in its reply

2

brief was silent.

3

today claiming that it is entitled, based on the fact of

4

a machinegun, to get 20 years more than any defendant

5

that perpetrated this conduct has ever gotten, and

6

indeed 18 more years than the government itself asked

7

the district judge in this case for, once the machinegun

8

provision was off the table, under the guise that this

9

is nothing more than a sentencing factor.

10

So, therefore, the government is here

We think that this Court's statutory

11

interpretation jurisprudence as well, if necessary, this

12

Court's constitutional jurisprudence foreclose such a

13

result.

14

Let me start with statutory interpretation.

15

On the government's theory in 1998, Congress stepped in

16

and took a statute that made machinegun use an element

17

and transformed it into -- into a sentencing factor.

18

other words, Congress, without a peep, a mutter, or

19

anything, and in -- in the course of doing something

20

entirely different, which was reacting to this Court's

21

Bailey decision, stepped in and took a fact that

22

formerly had to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable

23

doubt to trigger a 30-year sentence and left that same

24

sentence in place but now allowed it to be proved to a

25

judge by a preponderance, based on a presentence report,
27
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official

1

and, indeed, according to the government, also stripped

2

away the mens rea requirement that attached to the

3

statute when it was an element.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How about the short --

5

what is it, the one that gets 10 years, the

6

short-barreled rifle?

7

are together in the statute, and you said that it would

8

be startling because of the difference between 10 years

9

and the 30 years, but the short-barreled rifle is the

That's -- that's -- those two

10

same amount of time in discharging, and discharging is a

11

sentencing factor.

12

MR. FISHER:

We think, Justice Ginsburg,

13

that if this Court had to construe that statute in a

14

different case, that provision, it would find it's still

15

an element.

16

very significant difference between 10 and 30 years, but

17

structurally it is an element.

18

Now, I grant that it's a difference, a

And I think an -- a good way to go about

19

understanding this -- I heard my -- my opponent today say

20

that this would be indistinguishable from Harris or fly

21

in the face of Harris.

22

Well, there's three very important

23

differences between the machinegun provision at issue

24

here and the discharge provision in Dean and the

25

brandishing provision in Harris.

The first difference

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is that this an entirely separate subparagraph.

2

Now, if you imagine somebody amending the

3

statute and wanting to accomplish what the government

4

says was accomplished here, why wouldn't the firearm

5

type provisions just have been (iv) and (v) under

6

capital letter (A)?

7

They're not.

What the draftsperson did instead is break

8

them out into an entirely separate, stand-alone

9

provision.

As the AUSA described it, when he charged

10

them in the alternative in the district of

11

Massachusetts, he said I think it's a greater and lesser

12

offense situation.

13

And that's what we think.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, I guess I'm not

14

following the ball here.

15

conceded that sub (i), sub (ii), sub (iii) under (A) are

16

not sentencing factors but are elements.

17

MR. FISHER:

I thought the government had

Is that not --

I don't understand that to be

18

what the government has said.

19

government's argument is that the big paragraph with

20

capital letter (A) sets forth the elements, and then sub

21

(i), (ii), and (iii) are merely sentencing factors.

22
23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I believe the

Now, they have to because

that's what Harris said, brandished --

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's -- yes, that's Harris.
-- brandished is a

29
Alderson Reporting Company

1

sentencing factor.

2
3

MR. FISHER:

That's right,

Justice Ginsburg.

4
5

That's right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
then.

Well, that's even worse,

I agree with you.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. FISHER:

So what sub (B) does, as I

8

said, is it creates a greater offense, and so, it's

9

broken out in a way that incorporates the earlier

10

elements up above in the main paragraph by using the

11

phrase:

12

convicted of a violation of this subsection."

13

If a "firearm possessed by a person

That phrase, we believe, incorporates the

14

earlier elements.

15

emphasized that the brandishing provision just kept

16

going in the sentence and did not incorporate earlier

17

elements.

18

Remember in Harris this Court

So when the government stands here today and

19

says, well, when you incorporate the earlier elements,

20

that shows it's a sentencing factor, too, it seems to me a

21

situation of heads, I win; tails, you lose.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, their -- their -- their

23

basic argument is look at the statute.

24

undoubtedly a set of sentencing factors.

25

discharging are as traditional as they come.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

(A) has what is
Brandishing and
Then look

Official

1

at (C), and you find some other ones that are sentencing

2

factors, because recidivism is as traditional as it

3

comes.

And between those two they put (B).
So since the neighbors, (A) and (C), are

4
5

certainly sentencing, they must have meant (B) to be a

6

sentencing factor, too.

7

is one of their basic arguments.
MR. FISHER:

I -- as I understand it, that

Right.

give two responses to that.

And let me -- let me

First of all, if you --

10

if you look again at the appendix of the government's

11

main brief, which is 1a and 2a, the guts of the

12

statute is the "use or carry" language or "possesses a firearm"

13

language in the main paragraph.
And then, the -- from the "possessed" language

14
15

down through sub (iii), what you have is the Bailey fix

16

right there.

So, then what happens -JUSTICE SCALIA:

This Court --

Well, it either is or

-- has said a couple of times

that this is a theoretical maximum sentence, but, surely,

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if nothing else, the Sentencing Reform Act sets a

2

maximum sentence here if it's not just a straight

3

determinant sentence.
And we've argued at length in the O'Brien

4
5

brief that the reasonableness requirement under 3553 of

6

the Sentencing Reform Act would have to set a maximum

7

sentence.

8

given that no one has ever received more than 10 years

9

absent a machinegun here, certainly that maximum

And for the reason I said at the outset,

10

sentence would be far less than life and far less than

11

30 years.

But --

MR. FISHER:

Justice Breyer, the other thing

2

I'd point out is that, so therefore, once you make the

3

Bailey fix, you just come -- in the old statute, then

4

you come to the machinegun provision, and you just leave

5

it where it was.

6

statutes that we've cited in both briefs where there are

7

elements in the middle, sandwiched between sentencing

8

factors.

9

And, in fact, there are plenty of

Now, Justice Kennedy, you asked the general

10

principle.

11

terms of this Court's Sixth Amendment law, is that:

12

critical question to ask is whether the defendant could

13

receive the sentence the government seeks without the

14

fact at issue.

15

The general principle is this, at least in

Seven years is a sentence the defendant here

16

could receive without the machinegun finding.

17

is absolutely off bounds.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Thirty years

empirical studies or is there guideline support for

prove to the jury or are admitted by the defendant.

8

So -- so in this case, the defendant could receive 7

years, and we've conceded that.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There must be some

11

statutory provision that you -- that you -- that you

12

rely upon.

13

MR. FISHER:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16

Oh, certainly, Justice Scalia.
Where does 7 years come

from?
MR. FISHER:

Seven years comes from -- comes

17

from the statute, for brandishing, which is what both

18

defendants had admitted that they did.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Seven years --

Yes, but we know

that's a sentencing factor.
MR. FISHER:

But they've admitted it.

22

they've waived any Sixth Amendment right as to that

23

sentencing factor.

24

then you go to the guidelines, which sets a

25

7-year -- a 7-year recommended sentence.

We're willing to concede that.

34
Alderson Reporting Company

So

But

Official

1

Under this Court's jurisprudence following

2

Booker, we know that we take that recommendation and we

3

plug it into section 3553(a), which, if you want the

4

statutory language, directs that a sentence "no greater

5

than necessary to serve the following factors" be

6

introduced -- I'm sorry, be imposed.

7

at those factors, disparity is a factor this Court has

8

left in place and emphasized at every term since Booker,

9

and the guideline sentence.

And when you look

And when you put -- plug

10

those things into the facts here, we simply suggest

11

there is no way that it would be upheld as substantively

12

reasonable if the defendant got 30 years absent the

13

machinegun fact here.

14

And we've also cited in our brief several

15

places where the government itself makes this -- the

16

mirror image of the argument that I'm making in the

17

post-Booker, Gall, Rita world, when judges deviate

18

downward from the guidelines.

19

quoted one Eleventh Circuit case in our brief where the

20

government got overturned, as substantively unreasonable,

They emphasize -- we

We think there's also an even deeper problem that

2

predates this Court's Apprendi jurisprudence, which was

3

flagged by this Court as early as McMillan, where this

4

Court said that if what Congress does is step in

5

and manipulate the elements of a crime in order

6

to relieve the government of its obligation to prove

7

ordinary and traditional elements, then we have a pure

8

due process problem, irrespective of any Sixth Amendment

problem.

10

Now, this Court has never found such a

11

problem, but I would emphasize that the --

8

any further -- well, there is two places you can look.

9

You can look both at the intent of Congress and the

10

effect of what it did.

11

The intent of Congress, at least as

12

hypothesized by the Solicitor General, is laid out at

13

page 33 of its merits brief, where it says:

14

Congress was intending to do here is, quote, "simplify

15

and streamline guilt-stage proceedings" by relieving the

16

government of its burden to prove this case -- this fact

17

beyond a reasonable doubt to the judge.

18

one as, as this Court put it in Harris, an intent to

19

evade the ordinary requirements in the Fifth and Sixth

20

Amendments.

What

So that strikes

Then, as to effect, you can look at what

21
22

I've also -- what I've already emphasized, which is that

23

this sentence simply is not otherwise available, absent

24

that fact.

25

that it's dealing with an element.

And that, on its own, ought to tell this Court

37

But if it wants to dig even deeper, it could

2

-- it could describe it in terms of a 20-year increase

3

over what the defendant would otherwise get or what,

4

indeed, as we've said, anyone has ever gotten for this act,

5

absent a machinegun.

6

and say it's 83 percent higher; the Court used the phrase once,

7

"tail wagging the dog."

8

exactly what exact avenue this Court would pick.

9

if it were doing a constitutional analysis -- I'm

It could do it in terms of percentage

Again,

10

speaking right now constitutionally instead of

11

statutorily -- it would all end up at the same place.

12

But I want to make sure that I understood

13

your question also, with due respect to you, Justice

14

Ginsburg, because what I was talking about was 10 years under

15

(A)(iii), of course, is a sentencing factor, as this Court

16

held in Dean, whereas under (B)(i), the same length of a

17

sentence might be an element.

18

was a statutory answer, and I think, as a matter of

19

statutory construction, which is, of course, the first

20

thing you're going to address in this case, what we

21

think we can win on without even reaching the

22

constitutional questions.

23

apart from the same sentence, you have the structural

24

difference that I've emphasized.

25

That was a matter -- that

And the differences would be,

You have the tradition.

And let me say a word about tradition, if I

tradition canon that it established in Almendarez-Torres

4

5

further than Castillo itself to answer the tradition

6

question.

7

look to tradition is because if it's a close case, we're

8

going to not assume that Congress intended a radical

9

departure from past practice.

When this Court applies the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the Court's --

14

the Court's opinion in Castillo quite carefully noted

15

that it wasn't addressing this statute.

16

little bit of a bait-and-switch to say that, well,

17

Castillo decides this case.

18

MR. FISHER:

I think it's a

I don't contend that Castillo

19

absolutely decides the case.

My contention that I was

20

trying to make is that when this Court looks to

21

tradition for purposes of construing the new amendments,

22

that Castillo gives the answer on -- at least on

23

tradition, at least as applying that particular

24

question.

25

an element at least until 1998.

Because Congress, we know, intended it to be

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But I think that even -- even if you were to

2

step back from the Castillo analysis itself and the

3

Castillo factors themselves, you would also, I think, do

4

well to give -- again, not dispositive, but -- but

5

careful treatment to Castillo, because Congress steps

6

in, of course, and amends statutes all the time.

7

step in and they amend one portion of a statute, and

8

while they are at it, we know from the manuals that we've

9

cited and from the examples in the back of the O'Brien

They

10

brief that Congress often, while they're amending one

11

part, they reorganize or reword other parts of the

12

statute.

13

And this Court, across its statutory

14

interpretation jurisprudence, within criminal law and

15

outside, has always said that once we say the law means

16

something, we're not going to assume that Congress

17

changed the law unless we get some sort of clear

18

indication from Congress that it -- that it intended to

19

change the law.

20

Now, here, as I think has been emphasized,

21

but I'll just reiterate, there's not a peep of

anything in the legislative history or anything to

suggest that Congress was -- was intending to change the

And, in fact, it's not even a mere silence

We know quite clearly and affirmatively that
40

1

Congress was intending to do something entirely

2

different, which was respond to this Court's Bailey

3

decision.

4

But even in the language -- and the only

5

thing I think the Solicitor General even has for it in

6

this case is the language and structure, which are some

7

different words and different placement that it can at

8

least build an argument off of, because the other four

9

of the five Castillo factors are entirely unchanged.

10

But even the language, we submit, is a far cry from the

11

kind of change this Court ought to require before it

12

does a 180-degree switch as to what it had said the

13

prior law meant.

14

Just for purposes of stability in the law,

15

if nothing else, I think this -- it behooves this Court

16

to take its prior decisions seriously and to -- and to

17

engage in a dialogue with Congress that encourages

18

Congress to be clear when it wants to change what the

19

prior law is.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The prior statute -- which

21

was 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1), right?

That did deal with

22

short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun,

23

machinegun, and so forth, but that's -- that provision

24

didn't say anything about brandishing or discharge.

25

Where -- what was -- how were they treated under the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

prior law?
MR. FISHER:

They -- as you say, they were

3

not in the statute itself.

4

judges as -- on an ad hoc basis, would have treated

5

those as sentencing factors.

6

My understanding is that

And what Congress did -- when it came in to

7

respond to this Court's Bailey decision, I think it

8

codified all of the different manners of using the gun

9

in the context of one of these crimes.

So it not just

10

dealt with, yes, possessing ought to be covered, but it

11

talked about other manners, brandishing and discharging.

12

In Castillo, this Court emphasized again the big

13

difference between manner of using a gun and the type of

14

firearm which lies at the core of this offense.

15

If I would turn -- if I would leave the

16

Court with nothing else, let me emphasize again to the

17

Court the difference between this statute, which I think

18

the government wants you to think is no different in

19

intent, effect, or operation than the two that this

20

Court prior -- dealt with in Harris, as a matter of both

21

statutory construction and constitutional law, and in

22

McMillan, as a matter of constitutional law.

23

What this Court emphasized in both of those

24

cases was that there was a preexisting law on the books

25

that criminalized certain activity.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

And then a

Official

1

legislature later stepped in and set a mandatory minimum

2

for a particular fact that could accompany the crime at

3

issue.

4

in Pennsylvania, the various crimes covered by the

5

firearm mandatory minimum in that case gave 10-, 20-year

6

sentences routinely, and all the Pennsylvania

7

legislature did was step in and say:

8

we want at least 5 years.

Here, this is entirely and dramatically

different.

16

anyone has ever gotten for this conduct at issue.

17

is a difference not just -- it's not a minor difference.

18

It is a categorically different difference that we think

19

is enough, combined with other principles of statutory

20

and constitutional interpretation, to -- I'm sorry,

21

statutory interpretation to resolve this case on the

22

statute alone.

23

Here, the fact allows a sentence -- indeed,

That

But if you need to look to the Constitution,

24

we think that the Sixth Amendment, either as the

25

bright-line rule articulated in Apprendi dictates that

any fact that allows a greater sentence than the

2

defendant could otherwise receive is subject to the

5

emphasized in McMillan -- either of those would be

6

enough, and indeed require, a finding of

unconstitutionality here and a finding this Court

can avoid.
And if nothing else, Justice Breyer, I would

say that we think that this case can be resolved on statutory

grounds.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's a collateral point:

Does the government have to show, or does the -- don't

MR. FISHER:

I assume so, but I don't know

23

the specific answer to that, Justice Kennedy.

there is a dispute about, of course, is whether the --

25

if it were a sentencing factor, whether the government

has to prove knowledge.

2

would be an alternative basis for this Court to decide

this case, by saying you at least have to prove

knowledge even if it's a sentencing factor.

5

And we do emphasize that that

And let me just leave you with this, unless

6

there are any further questions:

The government makes a

arguments were not preserved or made properly in this

question:

projectile, so one that can be restored to do so also

22

qualifies as a firearm for purposes of the statute.

23

The definition of "firearm" in 921(a)(3)

My friend made the comment that brandishing

24

and discharge would have been treated, under the old

25

statute, as sentencing factors.

But they couldn't be,

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because the old statute had determinant sentences, and

2

brandishing and discharge weren't relevant to it.

3

there wouldn't be a higher sentence for those.

4

So

And that -- that reveals sort of a basic

5

flaw in this notion that somehow those can be treated as

6

sentencing factors, but Congress wasn't embarking on a

7

general litany of sentencing factors.

8

those to be sentencing factors, as the Court recognized

9

in Harris.

Congress inserted

Then what it did is move the firearm-type

10

provisions next in line, because that's what it thought

11

of them as, not as elements.

12

then it goes on to recidivism, which is also a sentencing

13

factor.

14

It moved them away.

And

So the overall result, then, of the statute

7

history, but there is the fact that the form manual says

17

if you're going to embark on this, here are some ideas

18

for how to do it.

19

not tell Congress substantively what it should do.

20

Someone had to make a choice to write that introductory

21

language, "a person convicted of a violation."

22

is what Congress passed, and so Congress intended that

23

those things, firearm type, that follow that are

24

relevant after the person has been convicted of a

violation.
