 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

 Mr. Goldstein. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS GOLDSTEIN 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

10

it please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 We ask you to resolve this case narrowly by 

12

reaffirming that an arbitrator, rather than a court, 

13

presumptively resolves a dispute over a precondition to 

14

arbitration.  That holding would decide the question 

15

presented and would resolve the circuit conflict and 

16

govern 99 percent of the cases in the lower courts. 

17

 Argentina wants you to decide a different 

18

issue.  Its position in this Court is that there is no 

19

arbitration agreement with my client in the first place, 

20

so it says a precondition to that nonexistent agreement 

21

is irrelevant.  Now 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Goldstein, do you 

23

take the position that parties can't, by contract, say, 

24

this particular precondition is  goes to my  to the 

25

parties' consent to arbitrate?

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

We do not take that 

2

position.  If a party were to say that, as the 

3

governments in NAFTA have done, as the Solicitor 

4

point  Solicitor General points out is the language of 

5

the U.S./South Korea Bilateral Investment Treaty, unlike 

6

this one, we think it would be settled that a Court 

7

would resolve the dispute. 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  So if the 

9

issue is what did the parties  as I see it  what did 

10

the parties intend on this question, why isn't the first 

11

options Howsam divide the one that we should follow in 

12

this setting?  The Solicitor General is suggesting that 

13

we shouldn't follow that.  We should give some sort of 

14

heightened deference to the foreign state, but I'm not 

15

sure why because the issue is always about what did the 

16

parties intend. 

17

 And, if the issue is always about that, 

18

don't we look at the text, the custom and practice of 

19

the industry, the behavior between the parties?  Don't 

20

we look at all of the factors we normally look at in 

21

deciding whether something goes to a substantive or 

22

procedural issue? 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

Yes.  So let me see if I 
All right.  So it's not 

that we hold, absolutely, that in every situation a

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

precondition is subject to an arbitral decision.  We 

2

look to those  to the issue of consent, don't we? 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, a couple of things 

4

about that.  You do  you have held in Howsam that, if 

5

there is a precondition to arbitration, it is 

6

presumptively decided by the arbitrators, rather than 

7

the courts, so that 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Maybe that's why the 

government is saying, we shouldn't treat it as a 
presumption, we should just treat it as 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

All right.  Maybe I can help 

12

by locating the parties' different arguments in this 

13

case because there are a lot of them.  We have said, of 

14

course, that we think you should decide the question 

15

presented.  Argentina wants you to go beyond the 

16

question presented.  We can talk about whether that's 

17

appropriate. 

18

 If you did decide the question of consent, I 

19

think you would do it in a threepart opinion, and some 

20

of the parts are contested, and some aren't.  This is 

21

how I would write the opinion:  Part one would say look 

22

at our decision in Howsam, and it's undisputed here that 

23

if this was an ordinary contract case, just between two 

24

American companies, then BG Group would win because this 

25

looks just like a procedural precondition.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 It's like the John Wiley staged grievance 

2

procedure, and I don't think the other side argues 

3

against that. 

4

 Then the other side has given you two 

5

different arguments for why you wouldn't apply Howsam 

6

and why you might have a different analytical framework. 

7

The first argument, we could call it part two of the 

8

opinion, is the argument of the United States.  And what 

9

the United States says is, look, the difference between 

10

this and Howsam is it's an international case. 

11

 And what's different in international cases 

12

is that, when you dealt with Howsam, you dealt with a 

13

set of expectations between parties agreeing to 

14

arbitrate that may not apply in the international 

15

context, and so maybe it's different. 

16

 Now, this  and the reason they say that 

17

it's different is that an international case, when it's 

18

cited in the United States, is governed by the New York 

19

Convention.  And in a New York Convention case, whether 

20

it's a commercial case, whether it's an international 

21

treaty arbitration case, what the rule of judicial 

22

review is  and that's what we're looking at here, do 

23

the arbitrators finally decide the question, or does a 

24

court, on judicial review, decide it? 

25

 In a New York Convention case, you look to

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the law of the citeus, here, the United States, the 

2

Federal Arbitration Act.  So I take the Solicitor 

3

General's position to be this:  Look, when you have 

4

Argentina arbitrating against a company from the United 

5

Kingdom, then the Argentine company and  excuse me 

6

Argentina and the UK Company don't have any exante 

7

understanding about whether the dispute will be finally 

8

resolved by a court or, instead, the arbitrators because 

9

who knows where the arbitration would occur.  Here, it 

10
11

occurred in the United States. 
 Our answer is that this objection answers 

12

itself.  It's true that they don't have a specific 

13

judicial system, that it will be ahead of time when they 

14

sign the treaty  Argentina signs a treaty with the 

15

United Kingdom.  They don't know whether a dispute over 

16

this precondition will be resolved de novo or, instead, 

17

it will be resolved deferentially because they don't 

18

know where the arbitration will occur, but they do know 

19

that the applicable law will be the citeus of the 

20

arbitration.  And there is precedent on this. 

21

 The government's argument here is about 

22

international arbitration governed by the New York 

23

Convention.  There are 149 signatories to the New York 

24

Convention.  There have been thousands of challenges to 

25

arbitral awards under the New York Convention.  And we

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are unaware of any precedent from any country, ever, 

2

that says we are going to not apply our domestic system 

3

set of rules, here, the Howsam first options lines, 

4

because this is an international case. 

5

 We know that 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I'm not sure that this 

7

argument helps you, but it's your argument.  But this 

8

arbitration took place in the United States because the 

9

parties agreed that's where it would take place, right? 

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Correct. 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So your  your argument is 

12

that, by agreeing that the arbitration would take place 

13

in the United States, they bought into U.S. arbitration 

14

law, no international modification? 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That's correct.  And that is 

16

what has been true in every New York Convention case 

17

ever decided in the United States and, so far as we are 

18

aware, every case decided by every New York Convention 

19

signatory because they have  they are accepting a body 

20

of rules.  When you were trying to confirm or overturn 

21

the award, they agreed to put it here.  That's how it 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

See, I would have thought 

23

that there would  there'd be an argument for saying 

24

that the first options principle shouldn't apply to 

25

international  or to a bilateral investment treaty.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The whole point of these treaties, as I 

2

understand it, is to take these disputes out of the 

3

courts because of distrust, at least of the courts of 

4

the country against which the claim is asserted and 

5

and put it in an international tribunal where some sort 

6

of standard international principles would apply, but 

7

that's  you don't like the idea. 

8
9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, that's part three of the 

opinion.  I just haven't gotten there.  Here's the 

10

reason why, and that is, the government's argument about 

11

the New York Convention doesn't have anything to do with 

12

investment treaties.  It's about the New York 

13

Convention. 

14

 And so it applies  a company from Japan 

15

sues a company from Ecuador, and they arbitrate in the 

16

United States.  So the government's position has very 

17

wideranging consequences for any international 

18

arbitration in the United States. 

19

 Now, Argentina does make the argument that 

20

you've described, and this is the next part of the 

21

opinion, if we got past the government's position, which 

22

I don't think has any precedent for having a special 

23

international rule, we come to Argentina's argument. 

24

And Argentina says this:  Look, the reason this isn't 

25

Howsam is that this is a unilateral contract,

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

effectively, and that is, we put our treaty out there, 

2

and now, BG Group has to do something in order to create 

3

an arbitration agreement in the first place because we 

4

don't have an arbitration agreement with them, we haven't 

5

consented to arbitration, then, because of that, call it a 

6

precondition, call it whatever you want, because an 

7

arbitration agreement hasn't formed, the arbitrators 

8

have no power to decide anything, and, therefore, you 

9

can't defer to their judgment. 

10

 We would never expect them to have the power 

11

to decide anything Argentina says because there's no 

12

arbitration agreement at all.  So that's the next part 

13

of the opinion, and it will get to the points you 

14

raised, Justice Alito. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could I ask you just a  a 

16

practical question and maybe the answer to this is 

17

obvious.  Is it too late, now, for you to begin 

18

litigation in Argentina?  Wait 18 months and then pursue 

19

arbitration? 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It is not.  There is a 

21

principle of latches, but there is an equivalent 

22

principle of equitable tolling, so it's true that we 

23

could go there.  I do think, ultimately, it's a point in 

24

our favor because it shows how pointless this exercise 

25

is.

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 We'll recall, of course, that while we could 

2

leave  we could file a claim in the Argentine courts, 

3

the Argentine courts, of course, would have the power to 

4

do nothing at all.  They couldn't bind us.  They 

5

couldn't bind Argentina.  They wouldn't have to decide 

6

the case in the first place, and then we would be back 

7

here. 

8
9

 And the question is, if you have a provision 
like that, which is, effectively, go wait in the 

10

Argentine courts, does anybody seriously think that that 

11

determines your consent to arbitrate, when it is that 

12

that act, going and sitting, can't have any effect on 

13

the case whatsoever.  Do we really 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that's not 

15

true.  There are numerous statutory regimes where 

16

Congress has decided, for example, it's valuable to give 

17

people a period of time to negotiate or discuss before 

18

you can go into  into court.  I mean, the EEOC and 

19

other sorts of things saying, let's everybody  you 

20

know, step back, you have to negotiate for six months or 

21

you can't sue for another eight months. 

22

 And a lot of times, nobody think that's 

23

going to change anything, but you can understand 

24

Argentina or any other country saying, look, before 

25

we're going to arbitrate  you know, try our courts,

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you may find  you may be surprised, right? 

2

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

3

 (Laughter.) 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

We would be. 

But, Mr. Chief Justice, my 

5

point isn't that it's not important.  I'll give them 

6

that it's important; they negotiated for it.  My point 

7

is that whether it's important or not doesn't tell you 

8

if it's a procedural step or a substantive step, in 

9

terms of their agreeing to arbitrate with us. 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, then, let me just 

11

make clear where we are.  Suppose we  or at least I, 

12

were to conclude that the court of appeals was right, 

13

that it is for the Judicial Branch to decide whether 

14

there is an arbitration agreement and duty to arbitrate. 

15

Then I were to further conclude that, given Argentina's 

16

position, they have waived the judicial requirement and 

17

that this arbitration should proceed.  I can't reach 

18

that second question because it wasn't raised. 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Kennedy, the way you 

20

would resolve that issue, I believe, is to get to 

21

Argentina's argument that it did not consent to 

22

arbitration, that there is no  there is no 

23

arbitration agreement in the first place, you would have 

24

to go outside the question presented to begin with. 

25

 Remember, the question presented that you

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

granted certiorari on, to resolve a very distinct 

2

circuit conflict at the urging of the arbitration 

3

community was what do we do if we have an arbitration 

4

agreement and this is a precondition to arbitration? 

5

 If you were going to decide the antecedent 

6

question, the question before that, is there an 

7

arbitration agreement at all, which is my part three, it 

8

is the argument that Argentina is raising in this Court, 

9

then I think you have to carry it all the way through. 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, let me just put 

11

it  I think there is  this is a close case.  I think 

12

there is substantial merit, the United Kingdom court is 

13

correct and that the court of appeals here is correct, 

14

as to the authority of the Court to decide the issue.  I 

15

also think that they are probably wrong on the merits, 

16

but I cannot reach that second question.  It wasn't 

17

presented. 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, I agree with you, 

19

Justice Kennedy, that if you were asking me did the D.C. 

20

Circuit correctly interpret the treaty and decide  I 

21

misunderstood you.  You have asked me, look, I see the 

22

D.C. Circuit's decision, which is three sentences long, 

23

on the question of whether they can invoke this waiting 

24

period, and I see the arbitrators, they're the experts. 

25

It's much more substantial.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 If you accept the United States' argument to 

2

remand this case, which neither of the parties think you 

3

should, then it could be  you could suggest to the 

4

D.C. Circuit it reopen it. 

5

 But, otherwise, I'm going to agree with you, 

6

Justice Kennedy.  I am a believer that you should stick 

7

with the question presented and the arguments that are 

8

properly presented to you. 

9

 Let me try, then, to deal with your point 

10

about the United Kingdom court and the point about how 

11

courts decide if there is an arbitration agreement.  We 

12

actually agree that you  you are obviously a court 

13

you need to decide if there is an arbitration agreement 

14

here.  You do decide that de novo. 

15

 The point that I want to get to in the part 

16

three of an opinion that I am imagining is that there 

17

clearly is an arbitration agreement here, and I am going 

18

to come to that in one second.  I will just bracket the 

19

point about the United Kingdom.  Remember that, as I 

20

said with the New York Convention, the United Kingdom 

21

has one system for reviewing arbitral awards, 

22

Switzerland has another, we have another one. 

23

 What you need to look to, I think, is your 

24

own body of law because each one of those systems is 

25

because of not some great principle 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Goldstein, you have 

given us three parts for an opinion. 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
Is it your position, 

5

essentially, that, under this bilateral agreement, the 

6

case is to be decided by an arbitrator, not by a court 

7

in Argentina or the United States?  And so the question 

8

is when an arbitrator will decide the case.  And so the 

9

question of when doesn't say whether it's an agreement 

10

or not.  It just says, that you sued too early, you 

11

started it  you started too early. 

12

 Is that your essential position, that this 

13

bilateral agreement says arbitration is the way this 

14

dispute gets decided, and everything on the way to that 

15

is what you call a preliminary question, but, 

16

essentially, the parties have agreed that their disputes 

17

will be solved by arbitration? 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes.  And can I maybe take 

19

you to the treaty itself and explain what I think are 

20

the questions for courts and what I think are the 

21

questions for the arbitrators?  Because I actually think 

22

it's pretty clear from the treaty.  It's in our Blue 

23

Brief in the appendix. 

24
25

 But Justice Ginsburg, the answer to your 
question is yes, and I will explain how that plays out

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under the treaty.  So this is the agreement that 

2

Argentina made with the United Kingdom, and the dispute 

3

resolution provision starts at Page 8A, it's Article 8. 

4

 Now, there are three conditions in this 

5

agreement on Argentina's consent to arbitrate.  It does 

6

have to agree, and we had to do something.  We had to 

7

invest.  And those three conditions are set out in the 

8

first sentence of the dispute resolution provision. 

9

 It says  and I am now on Article 8, Roman 

10

I.  "Disputes with regard to an investment," so this 

11

arbitration provision is only going to apply to an 

12

investment, which is a defined term under the treaty, 

13

"which arises within the terms of the agreement."  So it 

14

has to be a treaty claim.  "Between an investor of one 

15

contracting party and the other contracting party." 

16

 And so that is it has to be a U.K. investor 

17

suing an  seeking to arbitrate against an Argentine 

18

company.  And those are  if those things aren't true, 

19

there is no arbitration agreement. 

20

 Now, that  that language that I just read 

21

to you is from the local litigation provision, and then 

22

the treaty says the exact same body of disputes are 

23

eligible substantively for arbitration. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that's  it 

seems to me that this is a difficulty for you, the

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

structure of the treaty.  I mean, if you just end it 

2

after one, nobody would say, oh, well they must be 

3

contemplating arbitration or arbitration is in the 

4

background.  They say, look, you have got a 

5

dispute, if you don't resolve it, you bring it in court. 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right. 
Nothing about 

8

arbitration even in the background.  Then they say, if 

9

you want to go to arbitration, you can.  So, when you 

10

look at just the structure, it seems to suggest that 

11

Article I  8(I) is not part of the arbitration 

12

provision.  It stands there and says, this is what you 

13

do, and then the arbitration kicks in later. 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I'll agree with that, but I 

15

just don't think you can ignore the rest of it.  And so 

16

let me explain why that's true.  So as I said, those 

17

three conditions apply to the arbitration provisions, So 

18

I'm at the top of 9A. 

19

 "The aforementioned disputes"  those are 

20

the ones that meet the three conditions  "shall be 

21

submitted to international arbitration."  And then, 

22

Mr. Chief Justice, it turns immediately to the 

23

relationship between the local litigation and the 

24

arbitration.  And it's common ground that, in the 

25

example that you gave, if you had just part one  and I

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just think it's really important by you, 

2

Mr. Chief Justice, and that is, if this provision said, 

3

go litigate in the local courts, come what may, this 

4

would be a completely different case. 

5

 But this provision is wildly different from 

6

that.  It says, go to the local courts; whatever they 

7

do, it makes no difference.  It cannot stop the case, it 

8

can't change the issues that will be arbitrated, it 

9

can't have any effect on the arbitrator's decisions.  It 

10

is exactly like a waiting period, which exists in every 

11

international 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that  your 

13

argument would be better there if this was Article 8 

14

you know, arbitration of disputes or  you know, 

15

parties can arbitrate, but, first, they must do this. 

16

No, it just  you know, says settlement of disputes. 

17

The first thing is you can go to court here.  The second 

18

thing is, if you want to arbitrate, you do this. 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  Mr. Chief Justice, 

20

but then I would just take you to the next page, sub 4, 

21

and we understand what the answer to that ambiguity 

22

perhaps is, the last sentence is, "The arbitration decision 

23

shall be final and binding on both parties."  That is 

24

the only body under this treaty that can issue a 

25

decision that decides the parties' dispute.  It's only

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the arbitrators.  Now 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If you want to 

3

accept the invitation to arbitrate that is in 8(II).  If 

4

you don't, if you go to 8(I), which doesn't say 

5

anything, then, presumably, the decision of the tribunal 

6

will be binding. 

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Fair enough  no, that's 

8

not quite right, Mr. Chief Justice, because, remember, 

9

imagine that we went to the Argentine courts, and for 

10

the first time ever, we won.  And so that an Argentine 

11

court told the Argentine state, you know, we actually 

12

think you should pay this company $200 million. 

13

 What would happen then is that Argentina can 

14

take the question to arbitration, but nothing about the 

15

local court's decision binds anyone.  We  there is 

16

never a point at which you can say that the investor 

17

will abide by or be bound by a decision of an Argentine 

18

court under this system.  That's what's so unusual about 

19

it. 

20

 Perhaps I can explain why it's there 

21

because it is odd, I will tell you, and I will tell you 

22

that, in deciding this question that Argentina is adding 

23

to the case, in the context of this local litigation 

24

provision, it is a very strange vehicle to do that. 

25

There are only  only 1 percent of bilateral investment

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

treaties have this provision.  It's a historic remnant. 
 It's in  of the first 15 bilateral 

3

investment treaties that Argentina agreed to, it's in 

4

nine of them.  In the subsequent 40 of them, it doesn't 

5

appear at all, again, a good example of how it isn't 

6

really a condition on their consent. 

7

 And it is a remnant of an era of espousal. 

8

It used to be the case that, before these treaties, that 

9

an investor in BG's position would have to go to the 

10

Argentine courts.  And when Argentina first created the 

11

investment treaties, it kind of liked the idea that you 

12

had to spend some time in the courts. 

13

 But no one would agree to the treaty  this 

14

is Justice Alito's question earlier  no one would ever 

15

agree to these treaties if they didn't know that the 

16

decisionmaker would be the neutral, expert arbitrators, 

17

and so it just has this youhavetowaitincourt feel 

18

to it.  But it is absolutely critical that we look at 

19

the substance of the provision. 

20

 It's very much, Mr. Chief Justice, like the 

21

John Wiley case, which is structured, one, you will have 

22

step one of our grievance process; step two, within five 

23

days you have to go to our next step of the grievance 

24

process; step three, then you can go on to arbitration. 

25

It could have stopped, theoretically, at any of those.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

If you had given up at step one or two, you would well 

2

have been bound by it. 

3

 But the question you are being asked here, 

4

if we could just return to if you are trying to decide 

5

this de novo or, instead, defer to the arbitrator's 

6

interpretation of whether this litigation provision is 

7

binding, is, fundamentally, when Argentina went into 

8

this treaty, did it think that the arbitrators were 

9

going to resolve the disputes?  Right? 

10

 Did it expect  it's a question of consent, 

11

Justice Sotomayor  did it expect that the answers to 

12

these questions would come from the arbitrators or, 

13

instead, the courts? 

14

 And when we are talking about the process 

15

for getting it going  Justice Ginsburg talked about 

16

the timing, do you have to do this for 18 months, there 

17

is another provision here about 3 months, the natural 

18

understanding is that there is an arbitration agreement, 

19

Argentina knew that it could only get this treaty if 

20

there was a guarantee to the investors that they would 

21

be able to arbitrate, and so expects the arbitrators to 

22

decide this. 

23

 Imagine Argentina's world, if you will. 

24

Argentina's world is that every timing question, whether 

25

something has to be filed on blue paper  I have no

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

idea what the line they want to draw is.  Every 

2

procedural step is, instead, a condition on its consent 

3

to arbitrate, and that doesn't seem to make any sense at 

4

all.  There have to be procedural prerequisites. 

5

 And Argentina would recharacterize this as, 

6

as I said, a unilateral agreement.  So it's like 

7

Argentina says  posts a sign on a pole and says, if 

8

you pay me  if you find my dog, I will give you $100. 

9

And so you have to perform an act.  And it says we have 

10

to perform an act here.  We have to go to the local 

11

courts, or otherwise, there is no agreement at all. 

12

 Well, a few things about that. 

Arbitration 

13

is not a dog, and Article 8, if we just go back to page 

14

8A, does not require us to submit it to the local courts 

15

at all.  This can't be a step that we are required to 

16

take because we are not required to take it. 

17

 If I could just take you to the last two 

18

lines of it?  "It shall be submitted at the request of 

19

one of the parties to the dispute."  Argentina was just 

20

as entitled as us to put this into the local courts as 

21

we were.  It can't have been an expectation that we had 

22

to do something before it would consent to arbitration. 

23

And so I do think that this is just on all fours with 

24

John Wiley for that  for that reason. 

25

 The only other thing that has been put on

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the table in front of you is the question of whether 

2

Argentina's sovereignty should make a difference here. 

3

And this is kind of the second theme of the brief of the 

4

United States. 

5

 And I would say about that that the Foreign 

6

Sovereign Immunities Act, which was discussed, of 

7

course, in the last argument, has an express waiver of 

8

sovereign immunity for arbitration awards that's 

9

controlled here. 

10

 And if  when the Solicitor General's 

11

representative speaks, talked  if that person were to 

12

talk about what the treatment of these issues in other 

13

countries is, we are unaware, again, of any country in 

14

the world where the arbitral system of review in the 

15

courts changes in the slightest because one party 

16

happens to be a signatory to a treaty, and that makes a 

17

ton of sense. 

18

 Again, this is fundamentally a commercial 

19

relationship.  Argentina knew that it couldn't, in 

20

its  in the crisis that gave rise to these investment 

21

treaties, Argentina couldn't get the money to come into 

22

the country if it hadn't agreed to arbitration. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, what do you do 

with Wintershall? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

So, Your Honor, I think that

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there are a variety of cases out there that deal with 

2

the question in other jurisdictions of different ways of 

3

reviewing arbitration awards.  And those are unique to 

4

their own arbitral system.  We've cited decisions 

5

from  a decision from France, for example, that 

6

follows your Howsam line. 

7

 The important point I would make is that 

8

there is  when the other side points to decisions in 

9

which a court reviews de novo a jurisdictional ruling of 

10

an arbitral tribunal, none of those decisions are unique 

11

in any way to the fact that it was an international 

12

arbitration or an international treaty arbitration. 

13

 Their international rule, the U.K. rule, the 

14

rule in lots of other countries, is simply about 

15

arbitration.  The reason that the other side can say 

16

that this case might well be reviewed de novo in the 

17

United Kingdom, for example, is that the jurisdictional 

18

decision in essentially every arbitration of any kind in 

19

the United Kingdom will be reviewed de novo. 

20
21
22

 They just have a different approach to these 
questions. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Isn't that the same thing 

23

in France, which is supposed to be a popular place for 

24

international arbitration, that, in the first instance, 

25

the arbitrator decides, but, ultimately, the court can

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

review everything? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That is not the most current 

3

view, Justice Ginsburg.  In a case called Nihon Plast, 

4

which was the most recent court of appeals decision in 

5

France in 2004, the court adopted the 

6

proceduralsubstantive distinction that very much 

7

parallels Justice Breyer's opinion in the Howsam case. 

8

 But, even if it were the case, it's because 

9

the French have their own approach to arbitration.  We 

10

have a system that says, look, if you can always run off 

11

to court because of any of these procedural 

12

objections  it has to be on blue paper, you didn't 

13

write  wait for the  wait 30 days, another great 

14

example would be, in lots of arbitration provisions, you 

15

have to submit a sufficiently detailed statement of 

16

claim to the arbitrators. 

17

 Well, that would be 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do I understand your 

19

position that, in this case, you did not have to go to 

20

the Federal  to the Argentine court, by reason of the 

21

language in this agreement and not by reason of anything 

22

that Argentina did? 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The language in the 

24

agreement meant that what Argentina did disentitled it 

25

from being able to rely on this provision.  I will take

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you, quickly, if you don't mind, to the provisions of 

2

the treaty so you know what I am talking about.  There 

3

are two of them. 

4

 One is the one that the arbitrators relied 

5

on, and that is in the arbitration provision 84, which 

6

is on 10A, it says, "The arbitral tribunal shall decide 

7

the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this 

8

agreement, the laws of the contracting party involved in 

9

the dispute, including conflict of laws," and, then, at 

10

the end of the sentence, "the applicable principles of 

11

international law." 

12

 So this exhaustion requirement  it's not 

13

even an exhaustion requirement  the local litigation 

14

requirement is subject to international law.  And then 

15

earlier  and so three other tribunals have reached the 

16

same conclusion as this one, that you  for that reason 

17

of that provision, you can't rely in the particular 

18

circumstances on the local litigation.  And then Article 

19

3 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

24
25

Say that again. 
Sorry. 
By reason of 
There are three other 

tribunals 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

 that have reached the 

2

same conclusion as this one, and that is Argentina can't 

3

rely on the local litigation provision because it 

4

effectively closed the courthouse doors.  It's own 

5

conduct disentitled it. 

6

 Then ten other tribunals have reached the 

7

same conclusion based on Article 3, the most favored 

8

nation provision, because this requirement doesn't exist 

9

in the Argentina/U.S. BIT.  There are only three 

10

tribunals  to be clear, only three tribunals out of 16 

11

or 17 have agreed to enforce it. 

12

 If I could reserve the remainder of my time? 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

14

 Ms. Anders. 

15

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS, 

16

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

Thank you, counsel. 

17

 SUPPORTING VACATUR AND REMAND 

18

 MS. ANDERS: 

19

please the Court: 

20

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 The government's position in this case is 

21

based on the fact that this case involves a bilateral 

22

investment treaty in which the states' parties set forth 

23

a standing offer to arbitrate in the treaty itself. 

24

Because it's the treaty that determines whether there is 

25

an arbitration agreement in this case, principles of

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

treaty interpretation have to be used to assess whether 

2

there is an agreement. 

3

 So, therefore, applying the domestic law 

4

presumptions that are set forth in Howsam to this type 

5

of investorstate arbitration we think would not be 

6

appropriate.  Howsam shouldn't apply by its terms 

7

because the question here is a question of treaty 

8

interpretation, not a question of the likely 

9

expectations of parties to a domestic commercial 

10
11

contract. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I must say I don't follow 

12

that  that line of argument.  I mean, it seems to me 

13

the treaty sets the framework for an agreement, but it 

14

is ultimately the agreement that governs. 

15

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, there is no agreement 

16

unless the investor submits the claim to arbitration in 

17

accordance with the terms of the treaty, the conditions 

18

on the state's consent.  So, for instance, in the United 

19

States investment treaties and free trade agreements 

20

such as NAFTA the United States says that an investor 

21

may submit a claim to arbitration only if it first 

22

satisfies certainly procedural conditions. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't  I can't find 

24

it seems to me this has sprung, full blown, from 

25

someone's brain, but is not well embedded in any law

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that I could yet find.  That is the  this is not meant 

2

to be rude.  I'm trying to figure out where this idea of 

3

the consent thing comes from. 

4

 After all, it apparently comes from our 

5

Korean treaty and maybe one other, but I can't find it 

6

in  I can't find  the question in the case is, is 

7

this particular agreement, namely an agreement to go to 

8

the court first  shall we count it as that kind of 

9

matter as to whether this is arbitrable that goes to a 

10

judge?  Or rather is it that kind of procedural 

11

Howsam/Wiley type thing that goes to an arbitrator? 

12

 Now, we did our best, I think, to try to 

13

explain how to distinguish the one from the other in our 

14

precedent.  Now, you use different words.  You use these 

15

words about "consent," which doesn't appear anywhere in 

16

this treaty, but I think you are trying to get at the 

17

same thing. 

18
19
20

 And if you are not trying to get at the same 
thing, why?  Why not?  What are you trying to get at? 
 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, I think the reason that 

21

applying Howsam and its presumption that certain 

22

proceduraltype requirements, like notice requirements, 

23

would be decided by the arbitrator, the reason that 

24

would risk subjecting a state to suit without its 

25

consent is that, in investment treaties, what the states

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do is they say we will be subject to arbitration under 

2

certain circumstances. 

3

 But they also place limitations on their 

4

consent to that adjudication, in order to satisfy 

5

important sovereign 

6
7
8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Are you suggesting that 

they 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So if in fact there was the 

sate that said, Look, they don't say anything in the 

10

treaty, but it turns out, for purposes of counting time 

11

limits, filing a brief, they count Saturdays, but they 

12

don't count Sundays.  All right?  And the government 

13

says, quite sincerely, if we had known that they were 

14

going to do that, we never would have agreed. 

15

 I am trying to get an example of something 

16

that is as purely procedural as I can imagine, something 

17

no one in his right mind would think a judge, rather 

18

than an arbitrator, should decide.  But, under your 

19

rule, you're going to say the judges decide that and not 

20

the arbitrators, and that is what is bothering me about 

21

your rule. 

22

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, they decided them because 

23

the state sets forth in the treaty itself that these are 

24

limitations on their consent. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

By the way, in the treaty

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

itself, you can have dozens of things, as was true of 

2

Howsam, we will follow the UNCTAD, whatever that is, the 

3

UN  or AAA rules, and you look up AAA Rule No. 

4

1872(b), and it says just what I said.  Okay?  So, now, 

5

it's in the treaty itself, and why should that matter? 

6

 MS. ANDERS: 

Because, for instance, what the 

7

United States has done in negotiating its treaties and 

8

free trade agreements for decades, in every one of these 

9

agreements, is it has said, we need to limit the 

10
11

circumstances in which we are subject to suit 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I have only found two, by 

12

the way.  One was Korea, and I can't remember the 

13

second. 

14
15

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, we cited in our brief the 

Korea and 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MS. ANDERS: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But in any case 
 and NAFTA. 
 you explicitly say, 

19

these are our conditions of consent, and you raise the 

20

question to me, you don't answer it, because suppose one 

21

of those conditions had to do with blue paper, rather 

22

than white paper, suppose that they were just what I 

23

said, nobody still would think the United States was 

24

resisting arbitration on such a matter. 

25

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, to give you an example of

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a condition that we've actually used, NAFTA requires, as 

2

a condition on the United States' consent to arbitrate, 

3

that the investors, when they submit the claim to 

4

arbitration, they waive their right to pursue other 

5

remedies, and that satisfies a very important sovereign 

6

interests that we have and not being subject to parallel 

7

proceedings 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So, here, you are putting 

yourselves, I gather, that the UN rules, the AAA rules, 

10

the scholars who file our briefs, the Doctrine of 

11

CompetenceCompetence, whatever that might be, is, in 

12

fact, far broader than what they want.  It submits 

13

virtually every question of arbitrability to the 

14

arbitrator.  And the United States is taking a position 

15

quite contrary, I guess, to most of the world. 

16

 MS. ANDERS: 

I don't think that's correct, 

17

Justice Breyer.  What we are  what we are saying is 

18

that, when a condition goes to consent, whether it is 

19

fulfilled or not goes to whether 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How do we know that?  How 

21

do we know that?  The question is, is this litigation 

22

preliminary  going to the Argentinian court, is the 

23

litigation preliminary a condition on the consent to 

24

arbitrate a dispute?  What is the answer to that 

25

question, in the view of the United States?

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. ANDERS: 

That's a question of treaty 

2

interpretation, and this Court has said that you look to 

3

first the text, but you also 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Alright, so you've 

5

done all that.  And what does the United States  the 

6

United States is saying, court, you should look to all 

7

these sources, and then answer the question, is the 

8

litigation preliminary a condition on consent to 

9

arbitrate the dispute?  So, after looking at the sources 

10

that the United States is telling the court it should 

11

look to, what is the answer of the United States to that 

12

question? 

13

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, the United States doesn't 

14

feel that it is appropriate for it to express a 

15

definitive view on that question now because the parties 

16

have not argued this, really, as a question 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I would feel better about 

18

that argument, Ms. Anders, if you had at least suggested 

19

how we should go about deciding that question. 

20

 MS. ANDERS: 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And I could do that. Yes. 
Because you read this 

22

through your brief, and I don't know what a 

23

consentbased objection is.  In fact, you say 

24

consentbased objections can look very, very procedural, 

25

and it's still consentbased, or it might not be

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consentbased. 

2

 So all the  the techniques that we use in 

3

the HowsamFirst Options line of cases seem to go out 

4

the window and not be replaced with anything else. 

5

 MS. ANDERS: 

I don't think that's  that's 

6

right.  I think what you look to, just looking at the 

7

text, you can look to whether the text expressly calls 

8

something a condition on consent.  So, for instance, in 

9

NAFTA, NAFTA says that there are certain conditions 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But that's no different 

11

from the rules we apply when there isn't a treaty, of 

12

course.  I mean, if the arbitration agreement said that, 

13

that the  you know, the agreement is conditioned on, 

14

of course.  So what else?  What different rules would 

15

you apply, other than the commonsense rules that we use 

16

for arbitration agreements? 

17

 MS. ANDERS: 

Well, you would also  you 

18

would also look, possibly, for mandatory language in the 

19

treaty; so, for instance, if the treaty says that 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We would look to mandatory 

language in the arbitration agreement. 
 MS. ANDERS: 

I think that's right, but the 

23

problem with applying Howsam is that it's a presumption 

24

that is purely based on the nature of the requirement, 

25

so the fact that it is a notice requirement, the fact

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that it is a time limit, that that means that it's 

2

procedural and, therefore, the arbitrators would decide, 

3

unless it is clearly stated 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What about this  what 

5

about this principle:  If something, if some requirement 

6

seems to serve virtually no purpose, it's unlikely to be 

7

a condition of consent.  Would you accept that? 

8
9

 MS. ANDERS: 

No, I think that is still 

that would be grafting on a default term onto the treaty 

10

that may not reflect the treaty parties' intent.  I 

11

think, when states negotiate for these conditions on 

12

consent, what they are looking to are 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, there is nothing in 

14

the treaty that talks about consent at all, so we have 

15

to decide whether some requirement is a consent, is on 

16

something which consent is conditioned, or it's just a 

17

procedural requirement that would be decided by an 

18

arbitrator. 

19

 Would you not  would you disagree with the 

20

proposition that, if something really is trivial, it 

21

doesn't seem to accomplish much of anything, it's a 

22

historical vestige, it's unlikely to be a condition of 

23

consent. 

24
25

 MS. ANDERS: 

I think that one of the things 

the Court could look to is the nature of the

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

requirements, does it serve sovereign functions?  But I 

2

think, in doing that analysis, it's important to look to 

3

what the state says are the functions that its 

4

requirements are serving. 

5

 So for instance, our notice requirement in 

6

our treaties, they serve the purpose of giving us 

7

advance notice of particular claims and time to correct 

8

problems that may have been caused  you know, that we 

9

can correct and, therefore, avoid arbitration to begin 

10

with. 

11

 So I think you would look to the nature of 

12

the requirement, the text of the treaty, whether it's 

13

mandatory or whether it's expressly conditional.  You 

14

can also look, obviously, to what this Court has called 

15

ease of interpretation, so that would be the 

16

postratification understanding. 

17

 If this were our treaty, we would bring 

18

in  you know, the letter of transmittal that the State 

19

Department had provided after it had negotiated the 

20

treaty  you know, there would be a lot of information 

21

like that that a Court could look to. 

22

 And I think as the Court noted, in the 

23

Sumitomo case, you can have similar language in similar 

24

treaties that have different meaning because there is 

25

different negotiating history or the aids to

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

interpretation point different ways. 
 So our point here is that it's a matter of 

3

treaty interpretation and that you simply have to look 

4

to the text of the treaty 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What's wrong with the 

6

House  and I'm being a little defensive here  but I 

7

didn't think there was the presumption you are talking 

8

about.  I thought it said there's a presumption about 

9

that procedural rule, and I thought important language 

10

was the language that the Court has found the phrase, 

11

i.e., for the judge, applicable in the narrow 

12

circumstance where contracting parties would likely have 

13

expected a Court to have decided the gateway matter. 

14

 Now, that, it seems to me, a little bit 

15

easier to work with than this notion of whether a state 

16

gave consent or didn't give consent or it doesn't 

17

mention it in the treaty. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

 MS. ANDERS: 

Briefly. 
Thank you. 

I think, in the treaty context, 

21

the states' parties are not agreeing, and they don't 

22

have expectations with respect to the allocation of 

23

authority between the court and the arbitrator.  What 

24

they do agree to are conditions on consent that limit 

25

the terms on which the state may be subject to

37

Alderson Reporting Company

arbitration.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN I. BLACKMAN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. BLACKMAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 This is a contract formation case, and it's 
a case that is decided properly by the court below 

10

whether you apply first options or whether you apply 

11

treaty principles.  They get you to the same 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Blackman, may I ask 

13

you, preliminarily, on your view, what happens next? 

14

That  can this party  and suppose you're right 

15

can the  can the BG Group institute an action in 

16

Argentina and, if it's not resolved within 18 months, 

17

invoke arbitration? 

18

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

19
20

Absolutely, yes.  And my 

friend conceded that.  There is no barrier. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And if it is resolved, 

21

but not to BG's liking then, thereto, BG can invoke 

22

arbitration? 

23
24
25

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

That's absolutely correct, 

Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, doesn't that mean

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the treaty partners agreed that only an arbitration 

2

panel can conclusively resolve this dispute? Not a court. 

3

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

What the treaty partners 

4

agreed to here, Justice Ginsburg, was a condition  a 

5

precondition on their respectively derogating from their 

6

sovereignty.  Absent the bilateral investment treaty, 

7

there is no basis on which an investor could ever compel 

8

one of these states to arbitrate its claims, and its 

9

only remedy would lie in the courts of that state. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I don't  I don't get 

11

your answer to my question.  Am I wrong in thinking 

12

that, under this treaty, the ultimate decisionmaker is 

13

the arbitrator.  There is no provision for the court to 

14

be the ultimate arbiter of the controversy? 

15

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

It depends on the issue.  The 

16

arbitrator will decide the merits, assuming the offer to 

17

arbitrate has been accepted according to its terms, 

18

which was never done here. 

19

 After that, depending on the issue, there 

20

will or will not be judicial review of some kind, and 

21

what this court said, as a matter of U.S. law in First 

22

Options and what all the other countries say, and our 

23

brief really was not disputed on that point, is that 

24

issues of jurisdiction, whether a contract was ever 

25

formed, whether there ever was an agreement to arbitrate

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is ultimately an issue for a court to independently de 

2

novo decide. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why  why are you 

4

complaining about the other party not initiating 

5

proceedings in the Argentine courts when, if you really 

6

wanted those proceedings to occur, you could have 

7

initiated proceedings in the Argentine courts? 

8

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

First of all, as First Option 

9

said, we didn't need to do that.  First Option was very 

10

clear that it did not require someone who was resisting 

11

arbitration and objecting to the arbitrator's 

12

jurisdiction because there is no agreement to run to 

13

court, which would also be very bad policy. 

14

 We don't want people running to court. 

We 

15

want them to try an  an arbitration, but subject to 

16

judicial review, if the arbitrators get it wrong on the 

17

fundamental jurisdictional question 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I must say I 

19

don't understand that.  When  when you're appealing to 

20

a condition for the thing to occur and you can bring 

21

that about as  as readily as the other side, it's 

22

dog in the manger comes to mind. 

23

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

No.  We weren't the aggrieved 

24

party, Justice Scalia.  We were not seeking relief. 

25

They're the ones who were complaining.  We're  we're

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the putative defendant  the Respondent.  There'd be no 

2

reason for us to go to court. 

3

 What our offer to them was, was  first 

4

of all, you have to go to our courts for 18 months.  And 

5

then it says, in 8(2), and it refers specifically to 

6

"the aforementioned disputes," i.e., those disputes that 

7

have been brought to our courts, those aforementioned 

8

disputes can then be arbitrated "under the following 

9

circumstances." 

10

 And the first of those, in 8(2)  (a)(i) 

11

is waiting the 18 months.  And then, quite importantly, 

12

or in 8(2)(b) the parties can separately agree to 

13

arbitrate.  Well, if they don't separately agree to 

14

arbitrate, which did not occur here, you have to go 

15

through 8(2), (a)(i), which is either wait the 

16

18 months, so the local court can try to deal with it 

17

 And I'll tell you why that's important in a moment  or the 

18

local court does actually adjudicate it and then the 

19

party who's unhappy with that does have the right then, 

20

and then only, to go to arbitrate. 

21

 And that's the temporal sequence that the 

22

D.C. Court talked about.  It's set forth in the 

23

structure of the treaty that the Chief Justice talked 

24

about.  You go one, two, three.  They're in order for a 

25

reason.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's  the D.C. 

2

Circuit treated this as there is no agreement until you 

3

go to the local court first. 

4

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's correct. 
The argument is that 

6

there is an agreement to arbitrate.  That will be the 

7

method of dispute resolution.  You have to take certain 

8

steps before.  So you have to go to the local court. 

9

 But why isn't the dispute settlement 

10

mechanism decided upon by the parties' arbitration, and 

11

then what you have to do before that is in the nature of 

12

a procedural condition? 

13

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

I don't  I don't think 

14

that's the correct analysis, Justice Ginsburg, because 

15

the dispute resolution mechanism, which is, again, is an 

16

offer made by two states to each other to 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Blackman, can I just ask 

18

you to assume for a second that that's not so?  If you 

19

had  if BG and the Republic of Argentina had, itself, 

20

entered into this agreement, would you agree that this 

21

is a typical Howsam kind of provision? 

22

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

I would actually not, Your 

23

Honor.  Howsam  let's talk about the facts of Howsam. 

24

Howsam was  there was no dispute that there was a 

25

contract between the Howsams and the broker/dealer to

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

arbitrate under the NASD rules.  Those NASD rules, 

2

themselves, contained an eligibility requirement that 

3

the claim can't be more than six years old. 

4

 And those same rules also said the 

5

arbitrators get to decide about the interpretation and 

6

application of our rules.  So it was a 

7

classic situation 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

you distinguish John Wiley, which I think 

10

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12
13

So how do you  how do 

John Wiley 
 has two components, 

and the second cuts against you. 
 MR. BLACKMAN: 

And the first cuts in our 

14

favor, Justice Sotomayor.  That's exactly right.  My 

15

friend kept talking about John Wiley as involving only 

16

issues of procedural preconditions.  But the first part 

17

of John Wiley, where the Court says, quite clearly, you 

18

have independent judicial review, has to do with whether 

19

there is an agreement to arbitrate at all between the 

20

parties. 

21

 In that case, the parties sought to be 

22

pulled into arbitration against its will, was a 

23

successor  and the issue which the Court independently 

24

decided was, is that successor a party? 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Everybody's getting to the

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

same question, I think, but I haven't quite heard the 

2

answer.  Of course, you're right in many countries.  The 

3

question of arbitrability, that is to say, is there a 

4

contract is for the Court.  In an investment treaty, I 

5

can find a lot of authority that says whether this 

6

counts as an investment is a matter for the Court. 

7

 But the question in front of us, is this 

8

that kind of decision?  Is it one for the Court?  Or is 

9

it one for the arbitrator?  And to just summarize why it 

10

might be for the arbitrator, A, it's procedural, but 

11

that's not sufficient.  B, it refers to UNC  whatever 

12

it is  UNCITRAL? 

13

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

UNCITRAL. 
Yes.  It refers to their 

15

rules.  Their rules provide all matters of competence 

16

over the arbitrator.  The scholars have done exhaustive 

17

work saying most countries think that.  The Doctrine of 

18

CompetenceCompetence goes further, and you also have 

19

the AAA rules which say the same thing.  So those are 

20

all against you. 

21

 For you is the position of the  the item 

22

in the document, first and foremost.  All right.  I'm 

23

trying to summarize what I've got as the arguments for 

24

and against.  Now, what do you say to make me think 

25

there's even more for 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

I agree with you.  The text 

2

is key, and the text controls.  However, I strongly 

3

disagree, with all respect, to your statements about 

4

CompetenceCompetence and what other countries do 

5

because we have shown, essentially, without dispute 

6

here  and this in the third restatement, and it's in 

7

the case law of all these other countries, that 

8

CompetenceCompetence or CompetenceCompetence, or if 

9

you say it in German with a K, all that means is the 

10

arbitrators get the first crack 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

12

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So I agree that's not 
 it's not the last word. 
But those are not 

14

relevant  I mean, those are relevant.  I'm saying they 

15

would farther.  And I think, in what I've seen so far, 

16

it gives, on certain kinds of procedural gateway 

17

questions, deference to the arbitrator, which is what is 

18

at issue here. 

19

 And now  now, I'm back to the same 

20

question.  What is your evidence from this contract that 

21

this is not the kind of gateway question that is for the 

22

arbitrator? 

23

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

This is  and, again, my 

24

friend conceded this  this is an offer to a unilateral 

25

contract.  How does a unilateral contract get formed?

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Here, we're back at our basic contract formation 

2

principle. 

3
4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't think he conceded 

it.  He conceded that that was your argument. 

5

 MR. BLACKMAN: Well I think  then I misheard. 

6

 (Laughter.) 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8
9
10

There's a subtle difference 

between the two. 
 (Laughter.) 
 MR. BLACKMAN: 

I misheard him.  I misheard 

11

him then, and I apologize, Justice Scalia.  But this is, 

12

in fact, if you apply ordinary contract formation 

13

principles, as the Court says you must do in First 

14

Options and in Granite Rock, if you apply those 

15

principles, this is classic offer. 

16
17
18

 And the offer, we all know, has to be met by 
an acceptance on those terms, not on other terms. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, you said a few minutes 

19

ago you were going to explain why this litigation 

20

requirement is important.  And that is important to me 

21

because I don't see what it accomplishes.  I can 

22

understand a waiting period, but this is more than a 

23

waiting period. 

24
25

 You have a party who doesn't want to 
litigate in the  in the courts of Argentina.  It

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doesn't think it's going to get a fair shake there. 

2

What is the point of requiring this  now, I 

3

understand, it's a requirement. 

4

 But if it's not very important, if it isn't 

5

going to achieve anything, that seems to me to weigh 

6

against the conclusion that it's a  that it is a 

7

condition of consent. 

8
9

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

It is very important.  First 

of all, as a factual matter, this type of requirement 

10

appears in about 8 percent of bids, and it is most 

11

prevalent in UK bids, so this is not some weird 

12

Argentine thing.  The UK thinks this is important.  Why? 

13

A number of reasons. 

14

 First of all, a lot of these investment 

15

disputes  in fact, the vast majority  involve 

16

challenge to some local law, some local regulation.  And 

17

you want to have the local court have the first look at 

18

construing it, just as you would construe a statute 

19

before you reach the constitutional question. 

20

 The local court can illuminate the 

21

dispute  the investment treaty dispute by saying, what 

22

does our law actually mean?  Is our law legal under our 

23

Constitution?  That's one thing.  That's very important. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Let me just interrupt 

before  before the time expires  but I don't

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

understand  I don't know what the procedure is in 

2

Argentina.  Let's assume their civil procedure is like 

3

ours. 

4

 So you say they have to file a complaint. 

5

All right.  They file a onepage complaint.  They do the 

6

minimal necessary to keep the case alive in court. 

7

Maybe they don't even do that because they don't care; 

8

they don't want the thing to be  to be decided.  All 

9

they're doing is running out the 18 months.  What is 

10
11

achieved by that? 
 MR. BLACKMAN: 

Well, but that's their 

12

choice, which they, in fact, made here, not to avail 

13

themselves of the procedure 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let's say they avail 

15

themselves of the procedure in only the most perfunctory 

16

way, so as to satisfy the 18month requirement.  But not 

17

for the purpose 

18

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

Why should my client be 

19

punished because they don't diligently pursue a 

20

requirement of our offer.  They say, actually, in their 

21

brief, in one sentence, we accepted the offer and in the 

22

next sentence virtually 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO:

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you finish your 

answer? 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You're not answering my 

question. 

6

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I'm sorry. 
What is  if they do not 

8

litigate the matter in  in such a way as to get a 

9

decision on any of these local law issues, they just 

10

keep it alive, perfunctorily, for 18 months.  What is 

11

achieved by that? 

12

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

Well, they have  well, 

13

they've complied with it.  But, more importantly, it's 

14

what could be achieved if they wanted to achieve 

15

something, which is, as I said before, constructions of 

16

local law that would bear on the investment dispute. 

17

That's important. 

18

 Narrowing issues, making determinations 

19

which are not binding, but which are, nonetheless, 

20

perhaps instructive and helpful to the arbitrators. 

21

That's another issue. 

22

 Settlement is another issue. 

We talked 

23

about waiting.  We have EEOC.  You first have to go to 

24

the  to the commission because this, sometimes, gets 

25

settled.  If it doesn't get settled, as I say, it can be

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

narrowed.  All kinds of things that would be helpful to 

2

an ultimate arbitration. 

3
4
5

 And they could win, by the way. 

They could 

win. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Blackman, could you sort 

6

of indulge an assumption for me?  And the assumption is 

7

that, if this provision were in an agreement between two 

8

parties, we would treat it as a HowsamJohn Wiley kind 

9

of provision; in other words, we would say that this is 

10

just a procedural rule.  That's the side of the line it 

11

falls on. 

12

 So my question to you is: 

Why should this 

13

be any different?  You're treating yourself as though 

14

you never made an agreement.  But, in fact, you did make 

15

an important agreement.  You made an agreement with the 

16

U.K., the entire point and purpose of which was to allow 

17

U.K. citizens to bring certain kinds of disputes before 

18

an arbitrator. 

19

 So once we have a U.K. citizen with the 

20

right kind of dispute, it seems to me you're just in the 

21

position of any other person who's agreed to this 

22

provision.  And in  in my assumption, if it's a John 

23

Wiley type provision, it should go to an arbitrator. 

24
25

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

I have a number of responses 

to that, Justice Kagan.  First of all, I don't think it

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

is just a John Wiley sort of 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I know, but I said just 

3

assume that for me.  And tell me why you are in a 

4

position where some other result should go into effect. 

5

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

Well, it's kind of assuming 

6

the conclusion, if this is just John Wiley, that's a 

7

hard case for us, but the structure of the treaty, with 

8

all respect, demonstrates it's not, and that would be 

9

true even if this was, in fact, a contract between us 

10
11

and BG. 
 If we had a contract with BG that says you 

12

have to sue us first, okay, and then, after 18 months, 

13

you can arbitrate with us, I don't think we would just 

14

assume that that translates into you have to arbitrate 

15

with us.  They're really suggesting here, Justice Kagan, 

16

that this elaborate provision boils down to Argentina 

17

promises to arbitrate all investment disputes with BG. 

18

That's what it says. 

19
20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, the problem 

is 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Please. 
You're  it's a 

23

point on which I'm regularly confused.  You just said if 

24

we had this provision in a contract with  a private 

25

contract that said you must sue us, but there, you have

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

already a formed separate agreement to arbitrate. 

2

 And it seems to me clear that those  what 

3

do you call them, preconditions or whatever, that 

4

that  the argument that that's for the arbitrator to 

5

decide.  They may well decide that  you know, you 

6

didn't comply, so you don't get to arbitrate. 

7

 But it seems to me, typically, under First 

8

Options and Howsam, that is for the arbitrator.  Now, 

9

what makes it distinct in your case?  What, is it just 

10

the order that they're in?  Or what?  Or is it something 

11

special about a sovereign's agreement? 

12

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

It's  it's kind of all of 

13

the above.  It's the text, the fact that it is, in fact, 

14

an offer by a sovereign, rather than an originally 

15

bilateral agreement with the private party, but it's 

16

also  and this is much of what the case hinges on, is 

17

this an issue of contract formation? 

18

 If it's an offer, it has to be accepted on 

19

its terms.  And those are formation issues that go into 

20

construing an existing agreement. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It all gets down to 

22

the question, how do we tell  you know, the contract 

23

formation from the blue paper, right?  I mean, if it 

24

says  you know, we agree to arbitrate, and we use 

25

these rules and those rules say you have to have it on

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

blue paper, and it's not on blue paper, they say, oh, we 

2

didn't agree to have it not on blue paper. 

3
4
5

 How do we distinguish between those two 
scenarios? 
 MR. BLACKMAN: 

I  I think you have to kind 

6

of look at the language.  And, here, with all respect, 

7

it was clear to the circuit.  I think it's  we think 

8

it's clear  that the consent  which, remember, 

9

absent which there would be no arbitration, this is a 

10

sovereign, going back to sovereign immunity in our 

11

earlier case. 

12

 Where consent is expressly put  the word 

13

"consent" is not used  but the clear language of the 

14

text and the implications to be drawn from it clearly 

15

show that the sovereign is not willing to arbitrate, 

16

absent the 18months' recourse to its courts, you should 

17

view that as a condition precedent to a unilateral 

18

contract that must be accepted by action. 

19

 And the action is to bring the suit in the 

20

local court and wait 18 months.  An analogy, which may 

21

not be helpful, but I thought of it, so I'll give it to 

22

you.  If I'm looking for someone to paint my house and I 

23

make an offer to him, I say, I'll hire you to do it if 

24

you post the bond.  That's an offer to the unilateral 

25

contract.

53

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 He has to post the bond. 

He can't say, you 

2

know, I really don't like the bond, or you want a 

3

$20,000 bond, which isn't my offer, but I'll give you 

4

ten; now, we have a contract. 

5

 But let's assume we now make the contract, 

6

and I have progress payments in the contract.  Now we 

7

have a signed agreement between us that says, I'll pay 

8

you  you know, $10,000 per floor.  That's the kind of 

9

condition precedent within the contract that Howsam, 

10

perhaps, addresses. 

11

 But the first one is the formation issue 

12

that First Options addresses, did the Kaplans ever make 

13

the contract 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, what would 

15

happen  what would happen in this case if there was a 

16

judge's strike, so none of the courts were operating in 

17

Argentina?  What would happen then? 

18

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

Well, all you have to do is 

19

actually file.  So even if the courts weren't operating, 

20

which is an extreme hypothetical, all you need to do is 

21

file and wait the 18 months. 

22
23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

No, but the clerk's office 

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

The clerk's office is closed, 

too?

54

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

I suspect that the  there 

3

would be a very strong case to be made to the 

4

arbitrators that, if the claimant, unlike here, did 

5

everything it could to comply  and here, remember, the 

6

claimant deliberately "elected not to comply," the 

7

arbitrators might well find that the condition was 

8

excused and a reviewing 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, you can't  no, you 

10

can't say that.  You can't say that.  There is no 

11

arbitration agreement under your  it would still be 

12

for the court. 

13
14
15

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

Well, there could be an 

arbitration in the first instance 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Your  your whole 

16

argument gives me intellectual whiplash.  You have to 

17

say 

18

 (Laughter.) 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 well, you have to 

20

you have to go first to the court because that's what 

21

the arbitration mechanism provides, but there's no 

22

arbitration mechanism. 

23

 MR. BLACKMAN: 

No.  But, in this case, what 

24

would happen would be what happened in First Options and 

25

often happens, one party invokes arbitration, and the

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other party says, I never agreed to arbitrate with you. 

2

It would be very imprudent for the defendant in that 

3

case to do nothing and default.  And you said, in First 

4

Options, specifically, you don't need to do that. 

5

 So you present the issue to the arbitrators 

6

and you would then argue that there's no agreement, and 

7

the arbitrators would say, well, there is an agreement, 

8

or a condition was excused.  And, ultimately, on 

9

judicial review, on your facts, undoubtedly, a court 

10

would be likely to find, well, of course, they did their 

11

best, they tried to comply with a condition. 

12

 But that doesn't affect, to use my friend's 

13

terminology, the question presented, which is who 

14

decides in the first instance and then finally. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Goldstein, five minutes.

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS GOLDSTEIN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, I do have 

20

a rule that distinguishes the A4 paper, and that rule 

21

should be, and we think it does follow from the analysis 

22

of Howsam, which is just a thinking about when people 

23

make agreements and what they expect is that an 

24

arbitration agreement is formed and a party consents to 

25

arbitration when they guarantee that the ultimate

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision can be made by an arbitrator and not a court. 

2

It's forum selection.  We're going to have the ultimate 

3

decision made by the arbitrator. 

4

 And that rule is applied in the investment 

5

treaty context as follows:  And it is there is consent 

6

to arbitration when the investor is guaranteed that 

7

their claim can ultimately decide  be decided by a 

8

court, and the state can't force it to be ultimately 

9

excuse me  by an arbitrator, and the state can't force 

10
11

it to ultimately be decided by a court. 
 And I'll show you where that rule, how that 

12

line is divided in this treaty.  And that is, I gave you 

13

the three conditions at the beginning.  Those are not A4 

14

paper.  You have to be a U.K. investor, you have to have 

15

a treaty claim, you have to be suing another party to 

16

the treaty. 

17

 And if those aren't true, then there is no 

18

arbitration agreement and Argentina has every reason to 

19

say I have no idea why these arbitrators are here, this 

20

person's from Ecuador, not from the United Kingdom. 

21

 But on the other things  at that point, 

22

once  we are a U.K. investor and we have invested in 

23

Argentina, that's the performance that is required, once 

24

we did that, then we are protected by Article 8, the 

25

dispute resolution provision.

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 And you look at Article 8 and you say, okay, 

2

 does that guarantee that you have the right to 

3

 ultimately have it decided by the arbitrators?  Or can 

4

 Argentina actually insist that it will be ultimately 

5

 decided by a court? 

6

 And it's the former. 

We made clear, I 

7

 think, and nobody disagrees, that they can't force us to 

8

 go into court and wait for that ruling, take that ruling 

9

 in any way, shape, or form. 

10

 Now, my friend says that, look, this is like 

11

 a unilateral agreement, and this is like where I say 

12

 I'll hire you to paint my house, if you post a bond. 

13

 Well, that is a terrible argument for them because this 

14

 treaty reads as if he was saying, I'll let you paint my 

15

 house if you post the bond or I post the bond, because, 

16

 remember, the thing they want us to perform on, 

17

 supposedly, is something they can do, too. 

18

 Whoever heard of unilateral agreement that 

19

 was conditioned on either party doing something? There's nothing they're 

20

waiting for us 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They say that only the 

22

 complaining party can bring a lawsuit.  Evidently, they 

23

 have no declaratory judgment procedure in Argentina. 

24
25
26

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That  I don't believe that 

 is correct, Justice Scalia. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I was going to ask them

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 that. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I see.  I believe the 

3

 answer, when this was put to them, his answer to your 

4

 question was, I just don't have to do that.  His view 

5

 was  and it's a perfectly fine position to take, and 

6

 that is he's not going to help me win my case.  Fine. 

7

 But it does describe whether this is a 

8

 condition on his consent, that he could do it, too, and if 

9

 he could do it, too, it can't be something that he is 

10
11

 waiting for me to perform at all. 
 I would also say that, on this question of 

12

 whether it has any value, that all that you got, 

13

 Justice Alito, was that, if I were to pursue the case in 

14

 the Argentine courts, maybe something would happen, we 

15

 might learn a little about Argentine law. 

16

 First thing's first. 

I don't have to pursue 

17

 it.  Remember, his whole point is, when asked if the 

18

 courts were closed, he said, I just have to put the 

19

 piece of paper down. 

20

 So if this were a treaty provision that 

21

 actually involved litigation, involved exhaustion of 

22

 remedies, where we might learn something, that might be 

23

 a different case.  But this is a waiting period in an 

24

 Argentine court. 

25

 And, remember, as well, these are treaty

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 claims, and it is perfectly clear and undisputed that 

2

 the local court, even if it decided the treaty claims, 

3

 their ruling would not bind the arbitrators.  And so he 

4

 says, well, hey, we might win. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm not so sure you 

6

 don't have to do anything, you just submit the paper. 

7

 It says you have to submit it to the decision of the 

8

 competent tribunal.  And if the submission requires, 

9

 okay, now, you have to file your brief, and you say, I'm 

10

 not going to, I'm not sure that you've submitted it to a 

11

 tribunal for its decision. 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

13

 will then say that's a possible argument.  But let's 

14

 figure out who we would ordinary expect to figure that 

15

 out. 

16

 This is a treaty provision. 

It's  the 

17

 experts involved in treaty interpretation are the three 

18

 neutral arbitrators, who really do this every day.  It's 

19

 what they do.  They have enormous expertise in 

20

 interpreting treaties. 

21

 And so you might say  and it would be a 

22

 perfectly valid interpretation, well, maybe submitting 

23

 it to the local court requires some activity.  But do we 

24

 really expect, when the U.K. and Argentina ended this 

25

 treaty, that it would actually be the Supreme Court of

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the United States that would be deciding that question, 

2

 or instead, the arbitrators? 

3

 And if you believe it's the arbitrators, 

4

 then we win, because it's the kind of procedural 

5

 question that we put to them purposely. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That seems that 

7

 you're not totally circular in begging the question.  I 

8

 don't know that a sovereign would be anxious to submit 

9

 its sovereignty to three international law experts. 

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

And, surely, they wouldn't, 

11

 Mr. Chief Justice, but that's the point of the treaty. 

12

 Remember, my friend said, look, if it weren't for this 

13

 treaty, we could never sue them.  That's the reason 

14

 there's the treaty because, if there wasn't the treaty 

15

 and we couldn't get relief from them, we would have 

16

 never invested. 

17

 And so the whole point of this treaty is to 

18

 put these disputes into arbitration.  There is no 

19

 special substantive rights in this treaty.  They are all 

20

 customary international law.  The thing that matters in 

21

 this treaty  the thing that matters in all the 

22

 treaties is I don't have to have my case decided by an 

23

 Argentine court. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

 The case is submitted.
