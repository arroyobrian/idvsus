 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

argument next in Case 123, Lawson and Zang v. FMR LLC. 

5

 Mr. Schnapper. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

8

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

9

it please the Court: 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 Section 1514A is written in the classic 

11

language which Congress utilizes to regulate 

12

relationships between employees and their employers. 

13

Legislation regarding how an entity is to treat an 

14

employee is understood to refer to the entity's own 

15

employees.  And that is particularly true here where the 

16

phrase "terms and conditions" of employment is used in 

17

the statute. 

18

 If Section 1514A forbade only contractors to 

19

retaliate against employees under the terms and 

20

conditions of their employment, I don't think there'd be 

21

any question that the courts would understand it was 

22

referring to the contractor's own employees.  The 

23

statute has the same  that language has the same 

24

meaning, even though it's combined in this instance with 

25

prohibitions against retaliation by other types of

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

actors. 
 The First Circuit's decision interpreting 

3

1514A to permit a contractor to retaliate against its 

4

own employees is inconsistent with its general usage and 

5

it leads to four implausible consequences.  First, it 

6

renders the statutory language regarding contractors 

7

virtually meaningless.  Secondly, it renders that 

8

language with regard to contractors in the mutual fund 

9

industry literally meaningless. 

10

 Third, it has the implausible consequence of 

11

permitting the very type of retaliation that we know 

12

Congress was concerned about.  Retaliation um by an 

13

accountant such as Arthur Andersen.  And finally, it 

14

renders incoherent the provisions in 1514A and the 

15

related remedial provision regarding scienter,uh the 

16

burden of proof and an affirmative defense. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is it your position that 

18

employees of any officer, employee, contractor, 

19

subcontractor or agent of a public company are covered? 

20

They're all covered? 

21

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I'm not  it's our position 

22

that employees of contractors and subcontractors are 

23

covered. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

All employees or would 

you limit it 

4

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3
4

We 
 to the ones that had a 

hand in executing the contract? 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

We  if I understand the 

5

question correctly, we  we have not taken a position 

6

and the standard we advanced does not address the 

7

question of a  of a personal employee of an employer, 

8

such as Ken Lay 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if doesn't 

10

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

It doesn't raise distinct 

11
12

issues 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If it doesn't include that, 

13

then  then how do you avoid that with your reading of 

14

the text? 

15

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Your Honor, our view of this 

16

is that the  the meaning of the term "employee" 

17

depends on the context in which it's used and it ought 

18

to be assessed separately for each of the actors.  So 

19

when it says no publiclytraded company may retaliate 

20

against an employee, it means an employee of the 

21

publiclytraded company.  But  and the same thing with 

22

contractor and subcontractor. 

23

 But if we had a statute which by itself said 

24

no employee of  personal  no employee of an officer 

25

shall do something, the  the normal reading of that

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be to refer to an employee of the officer's 

2

company.  And we have statutes that impose personal 

3

liability on officials for things they're doing in their 

4

companies and that's the way they read.  So I 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that's sort of 

6

peculiar.  I mean, really, I don't see how you can piece 

7

it out like that, that it includes employees of 

8

contractors, subcontractors, but not  not of any 

9

officer. 

10

 But let me ask you this: 

If it does include 

11

employees of  of an officer, is it  is it as much of 

12

a disaster as  as your opponent suggests?  That is to 

13

say, would  would a firing for something that had 

14

nothing to do with the securities laws be swept in? 

15

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

The  the statute forbids 

16

retaliation for protected activity related either to the 

17

securities law or to certain criminal fraud provisions. 

18

And that's quite deliberate.  The statute 

19

SarbanesOxley is not limited to corporate misdeeds and 

20

related things.  Title VIII and Title IX also deal 

21

specifically  deal much more broadly with criminal 

22

fraud. 

23

 Title IX increases the penalty for wire 

24

fraud and mail fraud without regard to whether it has 

25

it was by a corporation or an individual.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

3
4

But it is 
So this is also an antifraud 

statute. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It is limited to those 

5

subjects.  And is  is the personal employee of an 

6

officer likely to be involved with any of those 

7

subjects? 

8
9

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

No, Your Honor.  They're 

unlikely to know of such things.  But  but the 

10

Congress deliberately wrote the statute to deal with 

11

ordinary wire and mail fraud, not just corporate public 

12

company related fraud.  The statute is is  broader in that 

13

regard. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So what's the limitation? 

15

That is, if the argument against throwing the 

16

contractors in the way you want, I think is, well, then 

17

there is no limitation.  So a company that let's say is 

18

a publicly traded company, lives in a  they have a building and they 

19

hire a gardener. 

20

 And the gardener is a gardening company and 

21

it has three employees and it works one day a week 

22

cutting their lawn and it works four days a week cutting 

23

somebody else's lawn. And  Is the mail fraud  and then 

24

they fire one of the three employees, or two. 

25

 And he gets annoyed and and 

says it was because

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of fraud.  Now, the fraud has nothing to do with the 

2

company that they're cutting the lawn for.  It has to do 

3

with some other customers.  All right. 

4

 So what  how  I don't think the statute 

5

intends to get that. I mean Does it want to make every mom and 

6

pop shop in the country, when they have one employee, 

7

suddenly subject to the whistleblower protection for any 

8

fraud, even those frauds that have nothing to do with 

9

any publicly traded company?  This is not really this 

10
11
12
13
14
15

case. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Yes, I understand, I 

understand. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But I'm trying to foresee 

is are you arguing for no limitation or 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I think there are two 

16

relevant limitations here, one of them statutory and one 

17

of them practical.  The statutory one is that, although 

18

it wouldn't deal with, I think, the situation you 

19

hypothesized, that the counterparty, so to speak, of the 

20

public company is described as a contractor.  And we 

21

think that is not anyone who has ever had a contract 

22

with a public company. 

23

 "Contractor" in the ordinary parlance refers 

24

to an ongoing relationship.  The paradigm is someone 

25

providing services on an ongoing basis, which of course

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fits lawyers and accountants perfectly. 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

3

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Yes. 
And so if someone from a 

4

private firm goes down to Walmart, buys a box of rubber 

5

bands, that in ordinary parlance wouldn't be referred to 

6

as a contractor.  So we think that as a practical matter 

7

that rules out most mom and pop stores.  They don't have 

8

that kind of relationship with people . 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course, it also rules 

out the accounting firm that is only used once, right? 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, it would have to be 

12

very fast.  I mean, I think an audit takes some time. 

13

But if you have someone come in for 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you just hire them 

for this one audit; are they a contractor? 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I think an audit takes long 

17

enough that they would be.  It's not like the  moments 

18

that it takes to buy something at the gift shop 

19

downstairs.  I think it typically takes weeks if not 

20

months, and I think in ordinary parlance you would call 

21

someone a contractor in those circumstances. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Could you limit it as also 

23

ruling out frauds by companies that are not publicly 

24

traded themselves of course, but where the fraud has 

25

nothing to do with the contract?  That is, the whole

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

activity just has nothing to do with the contract.  It's 

2

just chance that they happen to have a contract. 


3


 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

That's the way the Congress 

4

wrote the statute, and we think for two kinds of 


5


reasons.  First of all, that  the statute is also 

6

about, as you put it, garden variety fraud.  It's 

7

increased the penalty for wire fraud, for mail fraud. 

8

For the first time there is a provision for attempts and 

9

conspiracy.  It is an antifraud statute in addition to 

10

dealing with the Enron issues.  So we think that's 

11

deliberate. 

12

 Secondly, Your Honor, although 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14
15
16

I'm not sure.  Does that 

mean yes or no to his question? 
I'd have to remember the 

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

exact question. 


17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 


18

where the fraud at issue 


19

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 


20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 


21

to do with the contract? 


22


 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

23

Can you rule out frauds 

No. 
 has absolutely nothing 

The statute isn't written 

that way. 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It isn't written that way. 
Mr. Schnapper, that's the

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position that the SEC took in its amicus brief to the 

2

First Circuit.  It said Section 806 applies where 

3

employees of the contractor are reporting possible 

4

violations of law by the public company for which the 

5

contractor is performing work. 

6

 So it did put a limitation on the kinds that 

7

Justice Breyer has suggested.  In other words, yes, 

8

employees of the contractor, but only when the employees 

9

are engaged, you know, only when the violations of law 

10

that the employee is reporting relates to the work that 

11

the contractor is doing for the publicly held company. 

12

Do you think that that's a possible reading of the 

13

statute or not? 

14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, it's certainly 

15

possible.  We think it's not the correct reading.  And 

16

there's a 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So you are rejecting the 

district court's limitation as well. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

It's a possible reading, but 

we think it's not the correct reading. 

22

24

I didn't hear you. 

Yes.  Yes, we are. 
Why?  Why is it a possible 

reading?  It makes a lot of sense, I agree with that. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I'm not sure I want to go

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

down the road.  That's not  that's not our view.  I 

2

don't want to pick a fight with the government. 

3
4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Suppose that the  I 

suppose the 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Justice Breyer. 
The road is when you see a 

7

statute that says "any policeman," they don't mean a 

8

policeman on Mars, nor are they likely to mean a 

9

policeman in Europe.  The "any policeman" is likely, 

10

although it says "any policeman," to mean a policeman in 

11

the United States. 

12

 And similarly where they talk about this, 

13

the contractors, they don't mean frauds related to 

14

you have to use some kind of scope for the word  for 

15

the kinds of frauds that are included in the statute, 

16

and you have to read that into language that says 

17

nothing about it. 

18

 And that's  I don't say that that is 

19

necessarily easy to do and that's why I started with my 

20

first question. 

21

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

As I said, we think 

22

that's  we think that's not the correct reading of the 

23

statute, for a couple of reasons.  Another one  is that we 

24

think it unlikely, over and above the fact that Congress 

25

was concerned with fraud generally, was that I think

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress would have been reluctant to try to define what 

2

was sufficiently related to the corporation. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, to go back to 

4

Justice Breyer's hypothetical which gets at this point 

5

where you have the gardening  the gardening company, 

6

privately held, that's working for a public company, and 

7

there's some kind of employee of the contractor is fired 

8

and claims that the company is engaging in some kind of 

9

fraud that has nothing to do with the public company. 

10
11

So you have that situation. 
 Now you have the identical, another 

12

privately held gardening company, exactly the same thing 

13

is going on, except they don't have a contract with a 

14

public company.  Why would Congress have wanted to cover 

15

the former and not the latter? 

16

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Justice Alito, I think 

17

that's just the way they wrote the statute.  They were 

18

concerned with all fraud, but they didn't extend the 

19

whistleblowers to all fraud. 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But why?  If they are 

concerned with all fraud, why not cover them both? 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

Well, this is sort of a 

23

hybrid piece of legislation dealing with corporate 

24

problems and fraud, and they kind of melded the two 

25

here.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But I think there are  it's also important 

2

in this situation to to  bear in mind the following:  I 

3

think Congress would have  was reluctant  it didn't 

4

itself draw a line because the experience of the Enron 

5

scandal was that all sorts of terribly complicated 

6

arrangements had been drawn up between Enron and these 

7

hundreds of offthebooks entities, Jedi, Raptors, LJM, 

8

and the like. 

9

 I think Congress correctly concluded that if 

10

it tried to write out a description of what else it was 

11

covering, someone would think of a way to get around it. 

12

And I think it certainly wouldn't have contemplated that 

13

Federal courts were to try to untangle these 

14

relationships to the point where they could figure out 

15

whether, for example, if Andrew Fastow was skimming off 

16

money from Chewco, whether that would be sufficiently 

17

related to Enron.  It's just, it's enormously 

18

complicated and I think Congress didn't mean to open the 

19

door to that. 

20

 And that's brought home by the fact that the 

21

statute is written more broadly than AIR21.  It's 

22

essentially modeled on AIR21, which is a statute 

23

adopted a couple years earlier about whistleblowing in 

24

the airline industry, particularly with regard to safety 

25

work.  In that statute, "contractor" is specifically

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defined to mean an airline contractor dealing with 

2

safety.  They did not put that kind of limitation here, 

3

and I think it, in part, because it simply would have 

4

been very difficult to do.  And I don't think they meant 

5

to give the courts a commission to try to sort that sort 

6

of thing out. 

7

 The core problem with the interpretation of 

8

the court of appeals is that it really renders almost 

9

meaningless the decision of Congress to prohibit 

10

retaliation by contractors and subcontractors. 

11

Contractors and subcontractors would rarely be in a 

12

position to engage in retaliation, but particularly to 

13

engage in the very specific kind of retaliation 

14

specified in the statute, retaliation in the terms and 

15

conditions of employment. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is one of the limitations 

17

in the statute where it says, in sub (1), "to provide 

18

information relating to fraud against shareholders"?  Do 

19

you think "shareholders" means just the shareholders of 

20

the public company or does it mean shareholders of the 

21

 suppose you have an accountant which has shareholders 

22

in it.  And there is a fraud with the accounting firm 

23

and it hurts the shareholders of the accounting firm, 

24

but not the company that's registered.  Does the 

25

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

It's a 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The shareholders  in 

2

other words, does "shareholder" apply just to the 

3

publicly registered company? 

4
5

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I would think so, Your 

Honor, but that 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

7

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

You would think so. 
I think so.  But this clause 

8

in the alternative, it  it's  a report would be 

9

protected if it involves a violation of 1341 or 1343, 4, and 

10
11

8, which aren't limited to shareholders.  The words 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So "fraud against 

12

shareholders" just modifies the last clause or any 

13

provision of Federal law? 

14

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

15
16
17

Yes, it modifies the last 

clause, exactly. 
 With the Court's permission, I'd like to 
reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY, 

21

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

22
23
24
25

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The statute protects an employee of a

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contractor from retaliation.  That's what the text says. 

2

That's what Congress intended to cover, these 

3

accountants, lawyers, and outside auditors who were so 

4

central to the fall of Enron.  I'd like to go right to 

5

some of the questions that the Court had about the 

6

limits of the statute and how it would be applied. 

7

 Now, of course, what we're talking about 

8

here is really the core of the statute, a contractor 

9

retaliating against its own employees.  And we think 

10

that when the First Circuit said that that is 

11

unambiguously not covered by the statute, that it's 

12

wrong.  But moving beyond that, assuming that that is 

13

covered and asking some of these  or answering some of 

14

these questions about the limit. 

15

 First of all, as Justice Scalia suggested, 

16

the statute applies to individuals who are in a position 

17

who have information about fraud or securities law 

18

violations are in a position to report it.  So it is 

19

very unlikely that that would be the gardener.  It's 

20

incredibly likely that it would be an accountant or 

21

auditor, like a person who worked for Arthur Andersen. 

22

 Another 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It's not  it's not 

24

unlikely that an employee of a subcontractor will have 

25

information about something that can be  that can be

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

alleged to be mail fraud by that  by the contractor, 

2

that's not at all unlikely.  If you see  you know, if 

3

you see some civil RICO complaints, you see the kind of 

4

things that are alleged as mail fraud. 

5

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you disagree with that? 

7

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

No.  But I think it raises 

Right. 

8

your question raises a  another limitation on the 

9

statute, which is when the statute talks about 

10

contractors and subcontractors, it's contractor of a 

11

public company.  So that it's talking about the 

12

contractor working in its capacity for the public 

13

company, not the contractor doing some other type of 

14

work. 

15

 So if the contractor's work is for the 

16

public company and there is fraud being committed by the 

17

contractor, yes, that is something that Congress was 

18

concerned about.  It was concerned about the fact that 

19

Arthur Andersen was committing fraud, not against Enron. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes.  But you think this is 

21

limited to  to fraud by the contractor relating to the 

22

public company, not  not fraud that has nothing to do 

23

with the public company. 

24

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

25

I think that it can be fraud 

by the contractor while the contractor is fulfilling its

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

role as a contractor for the public company, not the 

2

contractor in some other capacity.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What do you mean while?

5

11

 MS. SAHARSKY: 
capacity. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

"Of such company."  The words 

"contractor and subcontractor of such company." 
 Now, it says 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

15

And where do you see that in 

the statute? 

12

14

In that capacity.  In that 

It says, "The contractor of 

such company," not "the fraud of such company." 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  But we think that 

16

when you're reading the statute holistically, that 

17

that's the most natural reading. 

18

 Now, I point out here that these are not 

19

questions that the courts of appeals or the Board, which 

20

is entitled 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The argument about this, 

22

the reason that we're  that I've brought this up is 

23

is because I think that the strongest argument in those 

24

courts of appeals that kind of held against you is that 

25

they fear that otherwise this statute would create any

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fraud by any gardener, any cook, anybody that had one 

2

employee in the entire United States and engaged in any 

3

alleged fraud would be covered.  But it seems to me 

4

there are many ways to skin that cat. 

5

 And  and one way that I suggested and now 

6

Mr. Schnapper said, no, that's  that kind of thing 

7

related to the contract isn't going to work very well 

8

because it's too complicated to try to figure out.  So 

9

maybe we don't have to figure it out in this case.  I 

10

mean that's possible.  I  I just wanted a universe of 

11

possibilities. 

12

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Yes.  I think this is a 

13

completely understandable concern that was raised by the 

14

First Circuit.  I have several responses to it.  First 

15

of all, I don't think you don't need to decide it in 

16

this case.  It's  this is a fairly mainstream 

17

application. 

18

 Second of all, this is the kind of thing 

19

that the expert agency should consider in the first 

20

instance.  There have not been cases, except for the 

21

Spinner case, that really has  that really have 

22

considered these questions about contractors and 

23

subcontractors.  In the history of this statute, there 

24

are only about 20 published cases that have ever reached 

25

the courts of appeals.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, you say  you say 

2

this is  this is a mainstream application.  We still 

3

have to give a rule.  Do we write in the opinion, this 

4

is a mainstream application case and therefore it is so 

5

confined?  That  that doesn't make any sense. 

6

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

No, Justice Kennedy.  My 

7

suggestion was, because the Court doesn't have to decide 

8

some of these more farfetched applications of the 

9

statute in this case, that it should leave it to the 

10

expert agency in the first instance.  The rule that we 

11

would 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, that  that was 

13

your second point.  Your first point was just talk about 

14

the mainstream in this case and leave other cases.  But 

15

I don't see how you can do that and interpret the 

16

statute.  That's what I'm asking.  Your statutory 

17

interpretation rule to keep this the mainstream is what? 

18

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I'm sorry.  I should be more 

19

clear.  What we think that this Court should say is that 

20

the natural reading of this provision covers, protects 

21

employees of contractors.  The First Circuit said that 

22

employees of contractors are not protected at all from 

23

retaliation.  And we think that that is wrong.  So that 

24

would be step one. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I understand that and I 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I think that's a plausible reading.  I don't see how 

2

it's confined to socalled mainstream, which is what we 

3

were talking about. 

4

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

What I was trying to suggest, 

5

Justice Kennedy, is that this is a contractor 

6

retaliating against its own employees and it's within 

7

the work that the contractor is doing for the mutual 

8

fund.  This is investment advising.  This is the heart 

9

of what contractors of mutual funds do for mutual funds. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I understand that, but 

11

but I think you're  I don't agree with you that 

12

that we don't have to get into these  these other 

13

situations, because to my mind, the principal argument 

14

made by the Respondent is if you read the statute 

15

literally the way you like, it covers a wide range of 

16

things that  that one would have no reason to believe 

17

Congress wanted to cover.  And unless you come up with 

18

some  with some limiting principle that  that 

19

eliminates that argument, I'm not inclined to go along 

20

with your  your broad interpretation of the statute. 

21

 So, I at least do have to grapple with 

22

with whether there are limitations, with  with what is 

23

 what is the central mainstream of the statute and 

24

and what is outside the statute. 

25

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  And what we're saying

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is that there are  there are several limitations.  The 

2

first is that it has to be a person who is in a position 

3

to detect and report the types of fraud and securities 

4

violations that are included in the statute. 

5

 Second, we think that "the contractor of 

6

such company" refers to the contractor in that role, 

7

working for the public company. 

8
9

 Third, the expert agency that has considered 
this question has looked at whether there would be a 

10

floodgates open and has concluded  and this is on page 

11

166 of the petition appendix  that there are builtin 

12

limits so that there would not be those floodgates. 

13

 And fourth, I can tell you as an empirical 

14

matter, that no floodgates have been opened.  The 

15

Department of Labor has consistently interpreted the 

16

statute this way since the beginning of SOX and you'll 

17

find on OSHA's website that it's only 150 or maybe 200 

18

complaints per year that are filed with the agency. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Saharsky, if I could 

20

take you back to second.  "Contractor of such company," 

21

you're saying we can read that to impose a limitation, 

22

that it's  it's not anything that the contractor does 

23

in any capacity for anybody, whether relating to the 

24

contract or not.  We could instead read it as, you know, 

25

"the contractor" means the  the entity doing a

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particular contract for a particular public company; is 

2

that correct?  Do I get that? 

3

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
In other words, inherent in 

5

the  in the word "contractor" or in the phrase 

6

"contractor of such company" is a sort of status of a 

7

company, and that one should not read this statute as 

8

applying outside that particular status. 

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I think that that's right. 

10

And the only thing that I would add to that is that it 

11

could be fraud that's being reported that the contractor 

12

is engaging in fraud in that contract or that the public 

13

company is engaging in fraud.  But Congress would have 

14

wanted both those covered.  It was Arthur Andersen and 

15

Enron that were involved in the fraud that led 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

This is not the 

17

Petitioner's position, however.  The Petitioner takes a 

18

broader  a broader interpretation as I understood him. 

19

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

That  that is my 

20

understanding as well.  But I think on the main question 

21

that's raised by this case, which is whether contractors 

22

can ever be covered, and the First Circuit said that 

23

they can't, we're in complete agreement. 

24
25

 I also want to point this Court to the 
Board's opinion in this case, which we think is entitled

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to Chevron deference.  It's an exceptionally thorough 

2

opinion when the Board went 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it just came up.  I mean, 

4

we are reviewing a decision of the Court of Appeals for 

5

the First Circuit.  And this Spinner case from the ARB 

6

postdates.  We have a district court, a court of 

7

appeals.  Chevron didn't raise its head until after the 

8

First Circuit was through with the case.  So how does 

9

Chevron come into this particular case? 

10

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

It's because the agency has 

11

been given this authority.  And the Court has faced 

12

cases before where it has afforded Chevron deference 

13

even though that was not an issue considered by the 

14

court of appeals.  I point the Court to INS v. Agere Agere. 

15

It's the  Congress has entrusted this expert agency 

16

with making decisions through formal adjudication. 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, even though it 

18

delegated rulemaking authority to a different agency, 

19

right? 

20

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

No.  There is no rulemaking 

21

authority for this provision under 1514A delegated to a 

22

different 

23
24
25

Then why isn't the SEC 

sorry. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And the SEC has no

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

rulemaking authority that would cover this provision? 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Not for this provision.  For 

3

other parts of SOX, yes.  But the antiretaliation 

4

provision in SOX, like about 20 other antiretaliation 

5

provisions, is entirely handled by the Department of 

6

Labor and it's entirely handled through formal 

7

adjudication.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

As I understand the 

ARB's decisions, they said that they were bound by 
OSHA's interpretation, right? 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

They said that, but then they 

also cited several of their 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And OSHA made it 

14

quite clear in its interpretation that it  and its 

15

rule that it had no authority to issue statutory 

16

interpretations. 

17

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

It said that it was not 

18

providing an interpretation, but I want to make sure the 

19

Court realizes that there are many other things that the 

20

Spinner decision relied on.  I point the Court to 

21

footnote 8 at page 143 of the board's decision where it 

22

says:  "In addition to this regulation, we're relying on 

23

several of our prior decisions"  many of which do not 

24

even cite the regulation  "and our decades of 

25

experience in looking at similar statutes like AIR21."

26

 So to think that

interpretation?

I don't think that the

 should be worse off 

9

because everyone who has considered this question within

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY 

15

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

16
17
18

 MR. PERRY: 

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Justice Alito asked why didn't Congress say 

19

all employers or no employers?  There are approximate 40 

20

whistleblower statutes on the books as of today, Your 

21

Honors.  And more than 30 of them, in fact, 36 of them, 

22

are phrased exactly that way.  They say "No employer may 

23

retaliate" or "Any employer is prohibited from 

24

retaliating." 

25

 This statute is not phrased that way. 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official

1

statute, which Congress could have written that way, and 

2

DoddFrank 922 is written that way, this statute is 

3

written quite differently.  This statute says, "No 

4

public company may retaliate," and then it has a 

5

subordinate clause and the subordinate clause is what's 

6

at issue here, that references officers, employees, 

7

contractors, subcontractors and agents. 

8
9

 Justice Alito also asked my friend, 
Mr. Schnapper, do you contend that the same construction 

10

should be given to officers and to contractors, and he 

11

acknowledged they have to say no, because the ARB has 

12

also said no.  In other words, an employee, the phrase 

13

that we are construing at the bottom of all of this, 

14

these turtles, is different they say for officers and 

15

employees and agents, presumably, than for contractors 

16

and subcontractors. 

17

 But that doesn't fit with the statute. 

It 

18

doesn't fit with the tools of statutory construction, 

19

and it doesn't fit with what Congress was trying to do 

20

here. 

21

 This was the  the failure of Enron. 

This 

22

was a bankruptcy situation.  Congress was acutely aware 

23

that corporate bankruptcies, failures, left victims high 

24

and dry.  One of the other provisions in this title, 

25

Section 803, specifically deals with the

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dischargeability of shareholder fraud debts in 

2

bankruptcy. 

3

 And what these sub  the subordinate clause 

4

that added these corporate representatives does is make 

5

sure that if the employer, the public company, goes out 

6

of business, the way Enron had just done, somebody is on 

7

the hook for the money damages that Congress authorized 

8

for these employees like Sharon Watkins.  It's a very 

9

simple regime to make sure that the victim, the 

10

whistleblower, is not left high and dry if the company 

11

that is, by hypothesis, riddled with fraud goes out of 

12

business. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What happens if another 

14

Enron situation comes along and the corporation's 

15

accounting firm retaliates against an employee of the 

16

accounting firm because that employee wants to report 

17

illegal activity by the corporation? 

18

 MR. PERRY: 

Justice Alito, the accounting 

19

firms are not covered by 806, and let me explain that. 

20

Accountants, accounting firms, and auditors are 

21

referenced by name 153 times in the SarbanesOxley Act, 

22

including in Section 802 in this title.  It says, "No 

23

accountant shall shred documents."  806 doesn't refer to 

24

accountants anywhere.  It refers to contractors.  And 

25

nowhere 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can an accountant be a 

contractor? 
 MR. PERRY: 

No, Your Honor, because the 

4

the contractor that's being referred to here  there's 

5

nothing in the statute, nothing in the legislative 

6

history, that suggests that an accountant is a 

7

contractor.  And more importantly, the reason for 

8

this is 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But then  but the 

10

bottom line of your argument Mr. Perry, is that the 

11

whistleblower who is working for the accountant  you 

12

say there are separate provisions that deal with the 

13

accounting firm and the law firm.  But the whistleblower 

14

who wants to disclose what nefarious thing is going on 

15

would have no protection against retaliation by the 

16

accounting firm or, if it's a law firm, the law firm? 

17

 MR. PERRY: 

Justice Ginsburg, that is the 

18

matter that the Congress left to the expert agencies. 

19

The accounting firms are regulation by Section 105 and 

20

the PCAOB. 

21
22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

question is right, they wouldn't have 

23

 MR. PERRY: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

But the answer to my 

Your Honor, if the 
 a whistleblower claim 

against the accounting firm or the law firm?

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. PERRY: 

To this day, the agencies have 

2

not written rules requiring that.  They could.  And 

3

and I would refer the Court respectfully to Section 501 

4

dealing with securities analysts, where Congress 

5

required the SEC to write a rule protecting 

6

whistleblowers at the investment banks that are 

7

securities analysts.  So when Congress wanted to protect 

8

those people 

9

 What Congress did for the accountants and 

10

lawyers was not to protect whistleblowers.  It imposed a 

11

mandate.  Section 10(a) 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I'm sorry.  You told me 

13

that Congress didn't provide for the whistleblower, but 

14

it allowed the agency to do so. 

15

 MR. PERRY: 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

17

 MR. PERRY: 

Correct, Your Honor. 
Which agency? 
The SEC for the lawyers.  That's 

18

Section 307.  And the PCAOB for the accountants.  That's 

19

Section 105.  And Section 10(a) of the Exchange Act, 

20

which is incorporated by reference, Your Honor. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

 MR. PERRY: 

What about the ARB? 

The ARB is nowhere involved with 

23

lawyers or accountants, as this Court made clear in 

24

the  in the PCAOB case.  The Congress decided to put 

25

the entire accounting profession under the thumb of that

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

new board.  That is a  a purposebuilt regulatory 

2

agency that regulates birth to death of the accounting 

3

industry.  And if they want to protect whistleblowers or 

4

not protect whistleblowers, that is the board's 

5

business. 

6

 Congress didn't do anything there. 

What 

7

Congress did in 806 was regulate the public companies 

8

and their employees.  And we can see this.  This  this 

9

tracks very clearly through the legislative history. 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

When you're  going to go 

11

through this, I'd appreciate your telling in your 

12

opinion  what the statute says, taking the extraneous 

13

words out, is that no contractor of a publiclytraded 

14

company may discharge, demote, et cetera, any employee 

15

because of his lawful act in reporting a fraud.  That's 

16

what it says. 

17

 So, what did they have in mind if they 

18

didn't have in mind forbidding any contractor of a 

19

publiclytraded company from a contractor  and, you 

20

know, maybe there are limitations there  but a 

21

contractor from demoting an employee because of his 

22

lawful act reporting a fraud? 

23

 MR. PERRY: 

Let me answer that in two steps, 

24

Justice Breyer.  First, with due respect, the Court 

25

inverted the statute.  It actually says, "No public

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

company," comma, "or" 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Or any  I just eliminated 

3

the extraneous words and instead of the not the word 

4

"such," I put in what "such" refers. 

5

 MR. PERRY: 

It's not extraneous here because 

6

it is  it is subordinating the contractors to the 

7

public employees.  And what  more importantly, second, 

8

what Congress is doing  and this is in response to my 

9

friend's question was this a meaningless act?  If I 

10

could point the Court to the Kalkunte case.  The 

11

Kalkunte case is an ARB decision from 2009.  It's cited 

12

at page 16 of the government's brief. 

13

 Here is a bankrupt company and the estate 

14

brings in a workout firm, a privatelyheld contractor to 

15

wind down the affairs of the company.  And this private 

16

contractor decides that there's a squeaky wheel employee 

17

within the legal department and fires her.  And she sues 

18

under Section 806 both the estate of the bankrupt 

19

company, that is the public company employer in the 

20

first primary clause of this statute, and the workout 

21

firm, the contractor. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  So all they're 

23

interested in here, you say, is this workout contractor, 

24

but not for example where you have a fund which has 

25

virtually no employees and does all its work really

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

through investment advisors such as here, and you think 

2

Congress didn't want to include the investment advisor 

3

firing its whistleblower even if it's directly related 

4

to the fraud, the  hot fund and everything else, but it did 

5

just want to include the people who  who are there 

6

because the contractor is a workout firm, and  and not 

7

the investment advisor. 

8

 MR. PERRY: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10

Your Honor 

conceivable reading, I agree. 

11

 MR. PERRY: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

13
14

Now, all that's a 

We 
But what is it that leads 

you to that conclusion other than 
 MR. PERRY: 

Three points here, Your Honor. 

15

First, when Congress wishes to reach investment 

16

advisors, in SOX and elsewhere it amends the Investment 

17

Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisors Act of 

18

1940.  And for this I can point you to DoddFrank 922, 

19

the parallel whistleblower's provision that my friends 

20

haven't talked about, but is very important here because 

21

it does cover all employers. 

22

 And when Congress covered all employers in 

23

DoddFrank, it amended the 1940 Acts to make clear that 

24

investment advisors were included.  And the SEC has 

25

issued its Form TCR that applies to investment advisors.

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Congress didn't do any of that in SarbanesOxley. 
 Second, we know the very next Congress after 

3

SarbanesOxley, took up the Mutual Reform  Mutual Fund 

4

Reform Act, which would have amended Section 806 to 

5

include investment advisors, to do exactly what the 

6

Petitioners in this case say the statute did.  Why would 

7

Congress have taken up, the very next Congress  all 

8

the same members are still there; Senator Sarbanes was 

9

still there  taken up a bill to do that? 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's sort of 

11

postlegislative history, which we usually don't pay 

12

attention to.  The  the problem that I have is if 

13

if the statute does not cover contractors', 

14

subcontractors', firing of their own people, what 

15

what coverage does it have?  A subcontractor usually 

16

cannot fire somebody from the principal company that's 

17

traded on the exchange. 

18

 MR. PERRY: 

Justice Scalia, it's not just 

19

firing.  It's also harassing.  It's also threatening. 

20

These are contractors who may be working 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't  I don't see how 

22

it can harass or threaten either if it's  if it's an 

23

employee of another company 

24

 MR. PERRY: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Sure, Your Honor. 
 that it has no power to

35

Alderson Reporting Company

2

fire. 
 MR. PERRY: 

Your Honor, it can  there have 

3

contractors that are in the operation, management 

4

consultants and others that are working side by side 

5

with public company employees who can make their lives 

6

difficult, who can make their lives intolerable, who can 

7

lead to a constructive discharge if it's bad enough. 

8

 And this Court has said in the Title VII 

9

context, that that kind of discrimination does not 

10

require a supervisory relationship, and these 

11

contractors, just like agents and officers, employees, 

12

may have that ability to affect the terms and conditions 

13

of the public company's employees. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But you  you're  you're 

15

eliminating the  the principal contractors who might 

16

have that kind of power.  You say they're not covered. 

17

 MR. PERRY: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MR. PERRY: 

The accountants and lawyers. 
Yes, yes. 
Absolutely.  But, you know, if 

20

there are  I mean, they are not covered by  for 

21

their own employees.  If they were to discriminate 

22

against a public company employee  the public 

23

company's employees are always protected.  That is the 

24

subject of this statute, the employees of the public 

25

company.

36

Alderson Reporting Company

 Let's look at the title. 

We know Congress 

2

didn't leave a big mystery about who they were 

3

protecting here:  Whistleblower protection for employees 

4

of publiclytraded companies.  That's what the Congress 

5

told us 

6

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Including by accountants 

and lawyers. 
 MR. PERRY: 

Against the public company's 

employees, I  I absolutely agree. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How so if  if accountants 

and lawyers are not  are not contractors? 
 MR. PERRY: 

If I said that, I  I misspoke, 

13

Your Honor.  I didn't say they weren't contractors.  I 

14

said they weren't regulated as contractors here because 

15

they were specifically regulated as accountants 

16

elsewhere.  If they fit within the statute 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What does it mean that 

18

they're not regulated as contractors here?  Unless it 

19

means that contractor here does not include them. 

20

 MR. PERRY: 

Let me  let me try to be much 

21

clearer.  The government makes the point that this 

22

statute is written to cover Arthur Andersen.  I can't 

23

agree with that.  Arthur Andersen appears all over this 

24

statute, and there's two titles of this statute that 

25

deal with accountants.

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Arthur Andersen might be included here if 

2

it  if it discriminates against a client, an audit 

3

client's employee.  That  that's just a normal 

4

contracting or agency relationship.  That's what 

5

Congress was dealing with.  What's not covered is Arthur 

6

Andersen retaliating against its own employees.  That is 

7

what Congress gave to the Board to decide or for the 

8

lawyers to the SEC to decide. 

9

 And, again, I would have to point the Court 

10

to Section 501, which ordered the SEC to make a rule 

11

protecting securities analysts. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Apparently, that's not 

13

the view of the SEC because I think they are  they are 

14

represented by the government.  And the SEC apparently 

15

takes the view that this provision does cover 

16

contractors.  It covers lawyers who couldn't be 

17

contractors and accountants. 

18

 MR. PERRY: 

Your Honor, they  they are 

19

defending the ARB's decision.  I agree with that.  The 

20

ARB's decision, however, is  all comes back to this 

21

procedural regulation that OSHA promulgated that they 

22

agree is not entitled to deference.  So it's not a 

23

reasoned articulation of the government's position.  It 

24

is, rather, a post hoc rationalization of what the OSHA 

25

said a long time ago.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It's a lot like the 

dissent in the First Circuit. 

3

 MR. PERRY: 

Your Honor, the dissent in the 

4

First Circuit, like the ARB, I agree, disassociates the 

5

statute, the language "an employee" from its context, 

6

from its grammar, from its syntax, from the title of the 

7

statute, from the legislative history.  I mean, the 

8

Senate report, Your Honor, goes through six times to 

9

explain what is the problem being addressed.  And 

10

Congress says, "There is no current protection for 

11

employees of publiclytraded companies."  That's at page 

12

18. 

13

 So what does this legislation do, Section 

14

806?  It provides protection for employees of 

15

publiclytraded companies.  That's at page 19. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You're right on that.  I 

17

mean, it is correct that that's what they talk about. 

18

And so that sends us on a search for limitation.  You 

19

have one limitation.  Your limitation says the person 

20

who is dismissed has to be an employee of the 

21

publiclytraded company. 

22

 Now, the government, and  and even your 

23

Mr. Schnapper has come up with accepting some 

24

limitations.  There are possibly others.  One would be 

25

on the nature of the contractor, which you want to do,

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but it would be somewhat broader than yours.  Another, 

2

possibly, is on the nature of the fraud.  Is it related 

3

to the contract?  Another might be the one the district 

4

court proposed, and there could be others. 

5

 So I think if you want to say anything about 

6

this, it seems to me that taking as given  I will for 

7

argument's sake anyway  say all the legislative 

8

history is about publiclytraded companies.  And I do 

9

look at it.  But nonetheless, they did use this language 

10

in their other possible limitations that would serve the 

11

same purpose. 

12
13
14

 Then you say to that, saying yours is the 
best, what? 
 MR. PERRY: 

Your Honor, first, the very need 

15

for this discussion about limitations, which is found 

16

nowhere in the statute and nowhere in the legislative 

17

history, is eliminated if the Court were to construe the 

18

statute as Chief Judge Lynch and the majority did below 

19

for 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh, that itself is a big 

limitation.  Huge. 
 MR. PERRY: 

That's exactly right.  Well, 

23

it's the limitation that Congress put in the statute, 

24

Your Honor.  If we go beyond that, it seems to me 

25

universally accepted by my friends on this side that

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

some limitation is needed.  It can't be every company 

2

with a contract to the public company, except that is 

3

what the ARB said a contractor is.  Okay?  And it can't 

4

be every kind of misconduct, except that's what the ARB 

5

has said this statute covers. 

6

 And I point to the Lockheed case, which has 

7

nothing to do with fraud against shareholders.  This is 

8

a runofthemill adulterous affair by a  by a 

9

gossip  by an office gossip and a supervisor that the 

10

person brings a lawsuit under Section 806 saying that is 

11

fraud because she submitted her expense accounts.  So 

12

what we have is 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

14

 MR. PERRY: 

15
16
17

That was fraud under 1343? 
As wire fraud, Your Honor, 

correct. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, was that what the 

fraud was in this 

18

 MR. PERRY: 

19

 So, Justice Breyer, your gardener, your 

In the Lockheed case, correct. 

20

threeperson gardener, there's a couple of problems with 

21

it.  First, if the same gardening company works for Ken 

22

Lay and for Enron  this goes back to Justice Alito's 

23

question  my friend's argument is they're covered when 

24

they work for Enron but not covered when they work for 

25

Ken Lay.  That's a bizarre reading of the statute.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Okay? 

2

 Second, they're covered under the  all of 

3

the socalled limitations they've been offered if the 

4

junior gardener thinks  hears gossip that the senior 

5

gardener is having an affair and submitting false 

6

expense reports regarding the hotel receipts  that's 

7

the facts of the Lockheed case  and reports that to 

8

the middle gardener, and nothing happens, and then the 

9

junior gardener gets fired because the economy downturns 

10
11

or something. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, those 

12

that's an easy hypothetical.  What about the butler who 

13

does, in fact, hear all this information about a 

14

conspiracy and wire fraud? 

15

 MR. PERRY: 

Your Honor, there are still the 

16

state law protections, of course, for public policy and 

17

other protections.  There is the DoddFrank Act.  We 

18

haven't talked about it enough.  DoddFrank 922 came in 

19

eight years later and said  Congress said we think we 

20

need to do more.  We think we need to cover all 

21

employers, but we're going to provide more limitations. 

22

We're going to require a written submission to the SEC 

23

under penalty of perjury, and we're going to limit it to 

24

securities fraud. 

25

 So if the butler learns that the boss is

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doing something untoward, the butler then can go to the 

2

SEC and make a complaint.  If it pans out, he can even 

3

get a bounty under that program.  And if he gets fired, 

4

he's completely protected and has reinstatement and back 

5

pay. 

6

 Congress dealt with that. 

There  there is 

7

a gap of eight years.  We definitely acknowledge that. 

8

But Congress moves incrementally in this area.  The 

9

the SarbanesOxley Act was the first major widespread 

10

corporate governance reform at the Federal level, and 

11

Congress didn't purport to do everything at once.  It 

12

went a long way.  It subjected every public company to 

13

these new things. 

14

 But for my friends to suggest that they 

15

covered not just the 5,000 public companies, but all 6 

16

million private companies without ever mentioning the 

17

fact, without ever discussing it, without debating it, 

18

without acknowledging that that would be the consequence 

19

is a dramatic  a dramatic expansion of this statute 

20

that was already pretty dramatic to begin with, that 

21

barely passed, as the Court may remember. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So doesn't that drama 

23

reduce itself if we accept the government's limitation 

24

that it has to do only with the fraud related to the 

25

public company?

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. PERRY: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3
4

Your Honor 
Because that was the 

center of this bill  what motivated this bill. 
 MR. PERRY: 

Your Honor, I agree that would 

5

be a  a limitation.  I don't agree that it's found in 

6

the language of the statute.  I mean, as a  as a 

7

defense lawyer, I would like that down the road.  But 

8

and the ARB in the Lockheed case didn't seem to suggest 

9

that there is any such limitation.  The ARB simply said 

10

fraud.  And Mr. Schnapper, Petitioners here certainly 

11

took that position today.  So it's every fraud of any 

12

sort by any company that has a contract 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But we're not being 

14

asked to give deference to the Petitioner.  We're being 

15

asked to give deference to the government. 

16

 MR. PERRY: 

That's why I pointed to the 

17

ARB's decision in Lockheed, Your Honor.  And the 

18

language there is exceedingly sweeping.  It rejected all 

19

limitations that were offered in that case.  The 

20

government's socalled limitation is no limitation at 

21

all.  It is simply anything that is fraudulent is 

22

covered according 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

They didn't say that today. 

24

And  and if, in fact, the fraud is related to the 

25

contract or by certain kinds of contractors who do

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

investment work, who do all kinds of important work for 

2

the company, why shouldn't it be covered?  I mean, and 

3

the language, of course, does say what I read, as you 

4

agreed.  It says a contractor. 

5

 MR. PERRY: 

Justice  Justice Breyer, if I 

6

could return to the point of this discussion of 

7

limitations, which is fascinating, but we are having it 

8

for the first time in the Supreme Court of the United 

9

States.  Congress never had this discussion.  Congress 

10

never discussed limitations because Congress never 

11

contemplated covering private companies. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What the statute says is 

13

"any conduct," "any conduct which the employee 

14

reasonably believes constitutes a violation of Section 

15

1341, '43, '44, or '48."  Do you see in there any 

16

limitation that says that the conduct has to be 

17

fraudulent conduct relating to the activities of a 

18

publicly held company. 

19

 MR. PERRY: 

It is not in the terms of the 

20

statute, Your Honor, and, as I just said, that was the 

21

holding of the Lockheed case in the  ARB. 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's a very sensible 

limitation.  Unfortunately, it's not there. 
 MR. PERRY: 

Your Honor, that's the danger of 

moving beyond the text of the statute. If we They won't

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

admit, my friends won't admit, that every contractor and 

2

every fraud is covered.  But that is the import of their 

3

argument.  We submit that that's not right, or at least 

4

that that decision, if it is right, should be made by 

5

the Congress or by an agency with rulemaking authority 

6

on the public record to take public responsibility for 

7

it.  No 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So it may be that you have 

a good point, that it's the SEC we should defer to and 

10

not the Labor Department.  But then, as was pointed out, 

11

fine, then you're going to have that rulemaking and 

12

given their position here, it looks as if they will hold 

13

something you don't like.  But  so what are we 

14

supposed to do about that, in your opinion? 

15

 MR. PERRY: 

Your Honor, they have not had 

16

that rulemaking since this statute was enacted in 2002, 

17

and we don't know whether they will have that 

18

rulemaking.  The Court's opportunity and I would submit 

19

obligation, respectfully, is to read the statute as it 

20

was passed by Congress. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I assume you would say that 

22

that rulemaking would be ultra vires, if it took the 

23

position that the government's taking here, right? 

24
25

 MR. PERRY: 

Your Honor, Ms. Saharsky said 

that the SEC has no power to make rules under Section

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

806.  I  I am not going to quarrel with her on that. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But even if they did and 

3

they came out with a rule that reads just the way the 

4

government presented it today, you would say that that 

5

is an unreasonable reading of the statute, wouldn't you? 

6

 MR. PERRY: 

We would, but we would also have 

7

a rulemaking record and a costbenefit analysis of the 

8

impact on private companies and the impact on employment 

9

and all of the things that agencies have to take into 

10

account when they make these determinations, none of 

11

which exists on this record.  We simply have the ARB 

12

deciding 5,000, 6 million, good enough, let's move 

13

forward.  And that is not, we submit, what Congress 

14

intended here. 

15

 Congress did not intend for the ARB to be 

16

able to make that decision.  Both of my friends here 

17

agree that our reading, the First Circuit's reading, is 

18

a plausible construction of the statute.  There is no 

19

argument that it is unambiguous on their side.  Okay? 

20

So their argument must be that Congress intended not to 

21

be able to answer this question, not to know whether 

22

it's 5,000 public companies or 6 million private 

23

companies, and so they punted that to an unelected board 

24

of lawyers within the Labor Department.  That is not 

25

plausible.

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why is it  we may have to 

2

get to this.  I thought Section 3(a) of 

3

SarbanesOxley  that's what we found here.  Quote, 

4

"The Securities and Exchange Commission shall promulgate 

5

such rules and regulations as may be necessary and 

6

appropriate in the public interest or for the protection 

7

of investors and in furtherance of this Act." 

8
9
10
11

 So why doesn't that delegate right to the 
SEC the power to interpret the general provisions of the 
Section 802? 
 MR. PERRY: 

To be quite blunt, 

12

Justice Breyer, before the government's concession 

13

20 minutes ago, I would have thought the same thing. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, so I mean, I don't 

15

know that we should interpret that provision since no 

16

one has briefed, given  on that basis. 

17

 MR. PERRY: 

We can certainly say this, 

18

though.  What we know is the SEC has not exercised its 

19

power under 3(a) or under 307 or under 501, also dealing 

20

with contractors of sorts, to provide for whistleblower 

21

protections.  If it chooses to do so in the future, then 

22

we would have a different lawsuit. 

23

 What we have now, however, is the unadorned 

24

statute passed by Congress, which deals with public 

25

companies.  We have the First Circuit in an exhaustive

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

opinion construing it, again using all the ordinary 

2

tools of statutory construction, which this Court has 

3

directed the lower courts to do, to determine plausibly, 

4

as everyone agrees, plausibly that it only covers public 

5

companies. 

6

 We have a reading, then, that gives meaning 

7

to every single meaning to every single word in the 

8

statute, that is comprehensible, that fits the purpose 

9

of the statute.  Remember the overall purpose of the 

10

statute is disclosure by public companies.  It is not 

11

protection of investors, as some at times have said.  It 

12

is disclosures by public companies. 

13

 Private companies make no disclosures. 

They 

14

are not governed by the securities laws.  So excluding 

15

private company employees makes perfect sense in that 

16

respect.  Mutual funds, Mr. Schnapper at page 13 of his 

17

reply brief says:  Well, the advisors make all the 

18

disclosures for the mutual funds.  We had that argument, 

19

Your Honor, two years ago.  Justice Thomas wrote the 

20

opinion for the Court in the Janus case, which rejected 

21

that very argument and said the mutual fund and the 

22

advisor are separate companies; the mutual fund makes 

23

the disclosures.  Congress has set up the mutual fund 

24

industry that way. 

25

 The ICI's brief in this case explains very

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cogently, I believe, all of the separate protections, 

2

including the independent board of directors and the 

3

chief compliance officer mandated by the SEC's '40 Act 

4

 regulations that protect the investors in mutual 

5

funds. 

6

 So we have a coherent, on the First Circuit 

7

side, a coherent reading of the statute that my friends 

8

admit is plausible, that gives meaning to every word in 

9

the statute, that fits exactly the title that Congress 

10

used.  And the title is legislative language passed by 

11

Congress signed by the President.  It fits every word of 

12

the legislative history.  It makes perfect sense and it 

13

doesn't have any untoward results.  We submit that 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It gives the reference to 

15

the subcontractors or to contractors and the 

16

subcontractors such a narrow meaning.  And except for 

17

this concept of the axewielding specialist, those 

18

provisions mean nothing under that.  That's what gives 

19

me pause about your interpretation. 

20

 MR. PERRY: 

Justice Alito, it gives 

21

employees two things.  They give another defendant, 

22

which means another insurance policy.  So for example, 

23

if you sue the company you get the E&O policy.  If you 

24

sue the president at the same time, you get the D&O 

25

policy.  So you get two separate insurance policies ,

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which is more money, more availability.  You get the 

2

personal liability.  Officers hate to be sued; so do 

3

contractors.  And if the public company goes out of 

4

business, you get that protection of monetary relief. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

My question wasn't clear. 

6

If you say that the employees, only the employee of the 

7

publicly held company and not the employee of the 

8

private  privately held subcontractor, then that 

9

the only situation is covered with respect to the 

10
11

contractor is this socalled axewielding specialist. 
 MR. PERRY: 

You have the axewielding 

12

specialist.  The real world is Kalkunte.  I gave you 

13

that case where that actually happened. 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes, it can happen, but it's 

really very small, isn't it? 
 MR. PERRY: 

Well, Your Honor, that was one 

17

of six cases the ARB decided under this statute in 2009. 

18

So that year that was onesixth of the cases.  That's 

19

not  I mean, it happens, okay? 

20

 And it is a  it is a conceivable scenario 

21

in many more things because, again, it's not limited to 

22

discharge.  It's also threats and harassment, and we 

23

certainly can see situations where contractors, 

24

particularly those kinds of contractors like management 

25

consultants, photocopy vendors, and so forth, are in the

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

facility with the public company employees, can make 

2

their life miserable. 

3

 And remember, I am going to agree with my 

4

friend Mr. Schnapper on something.  Congress recognized 

5

that Enron was structured in a way to try to get the 

6

liability out of headquarters.  They had all these 

7

subsidiaries, they had Chewco and Ponderosa and all 

8

this.  And Congress recognized that corporations might 

9

try to avoid their liability, so that by picking up 

10

officers, employees, contractors, subcontractors and 

11

agents, they were trying to make sure that if the 

12

company tried to lay off the responsibility on somebody 

13

else, they would still get captured because their 

14

employees were doing it. 

15

 They could have done that just under agency. 

16

Many employment laws, of course, speak only of officers, 

17

employees, and agents.  But many contracts disclaim 

18

agency, disclaim

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Where did it come from? 

20

That is, where did the words "contractor"?  Some human 

21

being wrote them for the first time.  You probably know 

22

who did and where and under what circumstances.  What? 

23

What, you know?

 JUSTICE BREYER:

Some of us are interested 

in that.  At least I am. 
 MR. PERRY: 

Justice Breyer, it appears 

5

that formulation appears for the first time in the 

6

history of the United States Code in this law. 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I know.  So who is the 

8

human being who wrote them and what did he have in mind, 

9

or she? 

10

 (Laughter.) 

11

 MR. PERRY: 

We know  we don't know the 

12

I don't know the individual.  We know, however, that 

13

there is a Senate report that accompanied that language 

14

when it was introduced. 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Let's go back to the 

hearings.  I mean, there might have been hearings. 
 MR. PERRY: 

The only hearing testimony was, 

18

for example, the National Whistleblowers Center, one of 

19

the amici here, said corporate insiders, publicly traded 

20

companies.  There is nothing  the word "contractor" 

21

specifically appears nowhere in the legislative history. 

22

In the entire legislative history of the SarbanesOxley 

23

Act, every hearing, every floor statement, every report, 

24

it nowhere appears. 

25

 It came, the word "contractor" came from the

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

AIR21 Act, but, of course, the AIR21 Act doesn't have 

2

"officers, employees or agents."  That is language from 

3

Title VII. 

4

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But the language did talk 

about Arthur Andersen and Enron. 
 MR. PERRY: 

It did, Your Honor.  And as I 

said, 150 times "accountants" appear. 

8

 If I could just finish with this point. 

9

Senate report lists four examples of the socalled 

The 

10

corporate code of silence:  The Andersen partner, the 

11

Vinson and Elkins lawyers, the UBS securities analyst, 

12

and Sharon Watkins at Enron. 

13

 Congress dealt with them in four different 

14

provisions:  Section 105 for the accountants, section 

15

307 for the lawyers, Section 501 for the securities 

16

analysts, and Section 806 for the public company 

17

employee.  And then  we haven't talked about this yet, 

18

either  it added, for good measure, Section 1107, 

19

which says whoever shall retaliate against anybody who 

20

provides information to a law enforcement officer, which 

21

includes the SEC, is subject to a criminal offense under 

22

Title 18. 

23

 So we have this interlocking, connected, 

24

nested series of provisions that deals with each of the 

25

concerns identified by Congress in an industryspecific

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fashion.  And at no point did Congress suggest, 

2

intimate, hint, that, oh, by regulating these things, 

3

the lawyers, the accountants, the securities analysts 

4

and the public companies, that they also were going to 

5

sweep in 6 million private employers. 

6

 And if a member of Congress, I would submit, 

7

had stood up on the floor and suggested that, it would 

8

have been met with debate, derision, and defeat. 

9

 The First Circuit's judgment, Your Honors, 

10

should be affirmed.  Thank you. 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

 Mr. Schnapper, you have five minutes left.

14

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

15

 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

16

 Let me begin by just referring the Court to 

Thank you, Your Honor. 

17

some materials that might be relevant to some of the 

18

questions you asked.  With regard to the SEC's view 

19

prior to this case coming to this Court, those views 

20

were expressed in a separate brief the SEC filed in the 

21

First Circuit, which is consistent with the government's 

22

approach here. 

23
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But we know they 

don't have rulemaking authority in this area. 
 MR. SCHNAPPER: 

I agree with that, but 

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but the question came up about what their views were. 

2

 With regard to the suggestion earlier that 

3

the ARB has taken the position that every contract 

4

every firm that has a contract with a public company is 

5

a contractor.  Actually, in the Fleszar case, which is 

6

mentioned in both the Respondent's brief and our yellow 

7

brief, the  the ARB is for the opposite position 

8

and  and took a position, I think, consistent with 

9

the view we've advanced, which is not every contract 

10
11

renders you a contractor. 
 With regard to Arthur Andersen, the 

12

discussion in the Senate Report about why there's a need 

13

to deal with retaliation is repeatedly about Arthur 

14

Andersen.  Many of the people who actually understood 

15

what was going on at  at Enron were Arthur Andersen 

16

employees, not most of the runofthemill employees at 

17

Enron, and they were the ones who remained silent in the 

18

face of this very, very serious problem. 

19

 With regard to the origins of this phrase 

20

contractor, my brother, Mr. Perry, was right, it comes 

21

from AIR21.  The preliminary AIR21 regulations 

22

regarding what it means were issued prior to the 

23

adoption of SOX and they said it included employers 

24

employees of employers, which has remained the view of 

25

the agency throughout.

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 My colleague  with regard to AIR21, the 

2

history here is, I think, important.  This statute 

3

referred to air carriers and contractors and 

4

subcontractors, and the court below assumed that that 

5

meant that employees of subcontractors and contractors 

6

were covered. 

7

 The First Circuit's theory was that Congress 

8

meant to narrow the meaning of contractor employees 

9

because it added retaliation by officers and employees. 

10

And it seems to me that that is precisely the wrong 

11

conclusion. 

12

 When Congress added to the entities that 

13

could not retaliate, when it rewrote AIR21 to add some 

14

other people that couldn't retaliate, it didn't mean to 

15

tacitly then eliminate the employees of contractors who 

16

were governed under AIR21. 

17

 Finally, with regard to the question the 

18

Court has raised about whether it should explore the 

19

possibility of a limitation based on whether a 

20

contractor was acting as a contractor, we think it would 

21

probably not be prudent to take that on at this time for 

22

a couple of reasons. 

23

 First of all, a fair amount of work that was 

24

done by Arthur Andersen was not  that was relevant 

25

wasn't done for Enron.  It was done for the

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offthebooks enterprises.  They did $5.7 million of 

2

accounting work for Jedi, where the debts  one of the 

3

places where the debts were being hidden.  So you 

4

you'd get into that problem. 

5

 Secondly, this provision is adopted against 

6

the background of a series of executive orders, most 

7

important which is Executive Order 11246, about racial 

8

discrimination by Federal contractors. 

9

 That executive order has always been 

10

understood to cover all the employees of the contractor, 

11

not just the employees who are working on the government 

12

project.  And I think that's an important part of the 

13

background.  Congress has not tried to  the Executive 

14

Branch hasn't limited it to that. 

15

 And in the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 

16

about 1986, Congress rewrote Title 6 and Title 9 to have 

17

institutionwide application rather than to do little 

18

parts of it. 

19

 This issue about what a contractor might be 

20

doing as a contractor hasn't been vetted in lower courts 

21

and we think it would be not prudent to try to  to 

22

take that on here. 

23

 Thank you very much.
