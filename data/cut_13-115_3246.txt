 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 13115, Wood v. Moss. 

5

 Mr. Gershengorn. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 

7

10

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 
 The Ninth Circuit held that individual 

11

Secret Service agents could be held personally liable 

12

for their onthespot decision to reposition a group of 

13

about 200 to 300 demonstrators who were within weapon's 

14

range of President Bush as he made an unscheduled  as 

15

he made an unscheduled stop for dinner at an outdoor 

16

restaurant patio. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

May I ask a question? 

18

So were the proBush demonstrators.  In fact, the 

19

proBush demonstrators were across the street pretty 

20

much at a diagonal to the President, and they were 

21

permitted to remain there the entire time.  He  they 

22

had a throwing distance of a bomb or a shooting distance 

23

as well. 

24
25

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, the 

proBush demonstrators were differently situated from

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the antiBush demonstrators in several fundamental 

2

respects.  With respect to the weapons range, there 

3

there was a twostory building between the proBush 

4

protestors and the  where the President was dining. 

5

It's in stark contrast to the open alley that led down 

6

precisely to the sixfoot wooden fence behind which the 

7

President was dining, which is where the antiBush 

8

protestors were. 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That was after the 

10

second move, not the first. 

11

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

No, Your Honor.  At the 

12

first move, when the President arrived for dinner, 

13

the  the proBush protesters were on the north  the 

14

antiBush protesters were on the north side of 

15

California Street between Third and Fourth, and the 

16

alley that led right down to the restaurant patio was 

17

right there.  The  they were at the head of the alley. 

18
19
20

 So they were very differently situated from 
the proBush protesters. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Counsel, I don't understand 

21

the government to be making the argument, and I can't 

22

understand why it isn't making the argument, that it 

23

doesn't matter whether there was any intent to suppress 

24

antiBush demonstrations, that in this area, as in 

25

traffic stops, we don't consult subjective intent.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 If  if a policeman stops somebody, 

2

and it's, oh, you stopped me only because I was coming 

3

back from an antiBush demonstration, we wouldn't  we 

4

wouldn't listen to that argument.  We'd say, did you 

5

have a broken taillight or not?  If you had a broken 

6

taillight, we do not inquire into the subjective intent 

7

of the officer.  Why is it any different here? 

8
9
10

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I don't 

believe we are avoiding the argument that Your Honor 
suggests. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

You haven't made it. 
We don't think it's  I 

13

think, Your Honor, with respect, that we have.  Our 

14

position is that it is not clearly established law, that 

15

if there were an objectively reasonable 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You don't even have to get 

17

into that.  You don't have to get into clearly 

18

established law.  It's a very simple case.  If you say, 

19

was there objectively a reason to move these people?  If 

20

there was, if you had an ulterior motive that was 

21

unconstitutional, we don't inquire into it. 

22

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, we agree with 

23

that.  We just have framed it as terms of  in terms of 

24

clearly established law, that if we think along the 

25

lines of what this Court said in Reichle with respect to

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

retaliatory arrest, if there is an objectively 

2

reasonable basis for the move  for the repositioning, 

3

such as a valid security rationale, it's not clearly 

4

established that the presence of animus would be enough 

5

to take  to raise a constitutional 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, do you agree with 

7

that, Mr. Gershengorn?  Because you have these 

8

hypotheticals in the last page of your brief where you 

9

say that a complaint could survive a motion to dismiss 

10

if the Secret Service members had, you know, announced, 

11

had admitted that they had an intention to discriminate 

12

or if they had told the local police that. 

13

 So I took what you were saying there to say, 

14

if there is evidence of a very clear nature, that it was 

15

all about animus and it was nothing about security, then 

16

the complaint would survive. 

17

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I think 

18

that the way we reconcile the two positions is the 

19

following:  If there is no objective legitimate security 

20

rationale, and it is animus, we agree that it would be 

21

clearly established law that the officers could not have 

22

taken  the agents could not have taken responsibility 

23

 could not have taken the actions. 

24
25

 However, if on the record there is an 
objectively reasonable security basis, then we don't

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think it's clearly established that, even if the 

2

individual officer didn't take the action for that 

3

reason and took it for animus, that it's not clearly 

4

established that that is a constitutional violation 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Could you get oblige us by 

6

answering Justice Scalia's question.  Forget clearly 

7

established.  What do you think the law is or ought to 

8

be?  If the only motive for the officer's action, for 

9

the Secret Service action, is one based on viewpoint 

10

discrimination, but that nonetheless there was an 

11

objective reason that could have justified the action, 

12

what should the outcome be there as a matter of law? 

13

Forget clearly established. 

14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

We don't think they've 

15

stated a constitutional violation in that context. 

16

However, what the Court did in Reichle 

17
18
19
20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't  what does that 

answer mean? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That means there is no 

constitutional violation. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you  so you say that 

22

any time there is an objective basis for the Secret 

23

Service to act to move a protester, the fact that this 

24

wasn't the motive at all, but that it was viewpoint 

25

discrimination is irrelevant.

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I want 

to 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is that your position or 

is it not? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That is our position, but 

I don't think that's what we need to win this case. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I know that, but the reason 

8

that you  the reason I think these questions are being 

9

asked, my impression is exactly what Justice Scalia said 

10

in respect to a Fourth Amendment case against a police 

11

stop. 

12

 But my impression also is that where you 

13

have a First Amendment case and it's not against the 

14

policeman, against Secret Service, this Court has not 

15

said that. 

16

 Am I right about that? 

And the reason that 

17

your position, if I am right, is relevant is because I 

18

think maybe we shouldn't say that for the first time in 

19

a case where the government hasn't even argued it. 

20

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now  and what is the 

22

answer to what I just said? 

23

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

The answer to your Honor's 
Am I right on part one, and 

am I right on part two?

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, you are right 

2

on part one.  The Court has never held it.  What the 

3

Court  the closest the Court has come is in Reichle 

4

where what the Court said was in a case of retaliatory 

5

arrest, it was not clearly established  the Court 

6

didn't reach the constitutional question.  The Court 

7

said it was not clearly established that where there was 

8

objective probable cause for arrest, retaliatory animus 

9

was not relevant. 

10

 We think a number of the same factors that 

11

motivated the Court in Reichle could motivate the Court 

12

here as well, were they to reach that question, and I'll 

13

explain why in a second.  But we do not need to win on 

14

that question because it's not clearly established.  So, 

15

Your Honor, with respect 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, we all know you don't 

17

need to win on that question.  The question is:  Should, 

18

in your opinion, the Court reach that question.  And my 

19

hesitation would be that it is one thing to talk about 

20

ordinary policemen.  It is another thing to talk about 

21

First Amendment matters where we are engaged with a kind 

22

of special protective force, and certain residences 

23

there that make  residences that may make a person 

24

hesitate to extend into that area.  And so what is the 

25

government's view?

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I've been 

2

asked the government's view on a couple of things, so I 

3

want to be very clear. 

4

 The question of what is our position is the 

5

position articulated by Justice Scalia.  The question of 

6

what we need to win, it's qualified immunity. 

7

 The question of whether the Court should 

8

reach the constitutional question, I think our answer 

9

would be no, that the parties haven't breached it as 

10

Your Honor said, that the normal course would be to do 

11

what the Court said in Reichle and say that it's not 

12

clearly established.  But 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I can't understand why you 

14

didn't brief it then in that case.  I cannot understand 

15

why you didn't brief it.  And  and talking about 

16

things that we haven't  haven't held in the past, we 

17

haven't even held in the past that  that there is a 

18

Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment violation, 

19

have we? 

20

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22
23

No, Your Honor. 
Do we have any cases that 

has held that? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

No.  And we agree with 

24

that, but the argument was not preserved below, so we 

25

have not presented it here.

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is that a 

2

relevant  well, what is your position on that?  Is it 

3

pertinent in analyzing qualified immunity that there's 

4

no private right of action for the asserted 

5

constitutional violation? 

6

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

We do believe, Your Honor, 

7

that it is  it is  the Court would have jurisdiction 

8

to reach it because it's a logically antecedent question 

9

and that it would be something that the Court could 

10
11
12

consider.  It's not something 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But I don't mean 

what the Court could consider. 

13

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
I want to know 

15

whether or not  well, the question is simple.  Can you 

16

only  can you not violate the Constitution if there's 

17

no right of action against you, or do you look and say, 

18

well, whether there's a right of action or not, it still 

19

violates the Constitution? 

20

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I think that 

21

the presence of  the Court's hesitant to recognize 

22

Bivens and the factors that go into the  that gave the 

23

Court hesitance to extend Bivens to First Amendment 

24

claims are relevant to the analysis here.  We didn't 

25

raise this argument because it wasn't preserved below,

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but we do think the very same factors that should 

2

that would give the Court pause about recognizing a 

3

Bivens actions are the ones that would cause the Court 

4

to reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision here. 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, on  on the merits 

6

of the case, if you were called to brief the Secret 

7

Service, what would you say in response to this 

8

question:  Do we have any duties under the First 

9

Amendment when we are protecting the President with 

10

respect to crowds and  and people that are close to 

11

him?  Do we have any First Amendment duty? 

12

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, we would 

13

first of all, as the policy  I know Your Honor hasn't 

14

asked this, but I just want to make clear.  There's a 

15

policy that would generally prohibit the Secret Service 

16

from doing that, an internal policy.  With respect to 

17

what the Constitution 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

They're asking about a 

19

law, they say we want to know what the law is.  We're 

20

law enforcement officers.  Will you please tell us what 

21

the law is. 

22

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I would say, Your Honor, 

23

that the law is not clearly established.  This Court has 

24

never held that the Secret Service 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

They said that's why we've invited

12

Alderson Reporting Company

you to lunch, so that you will tell us what the law is.

that it's not

And we may yet get 

Could I 
 that it's not 
 have an answer to this 

question, please? 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Answer Justice 

Kennedy's question. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

We would tell  I think I 

14

would have to say in candor, Your Honor, that in part 

15

because of some of the discussion we're having, that we 

16

think the better view of the law would be if you have an 

17

objective security rationale for the action, that the 

18

retaliatory animus would not render that 

19

unconstitutional. 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, can I ask you a 

question? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

But I would have to say 

23

that that's not clearly established and there's a 

24

rule 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you think it's not

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

clearly established that you can't discriminate 

2

solely  I've used the word "solely."  No security 

3

reason, no nothing.  You can't discriminate solely on 

4

the basis of viewpoint? 

5

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

6

Honor.  We agree with that. 

7
8
9

That's correct, Your 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's constitutionally 

established? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

And I take that as 

10

different from the hypothetical that Justice Scalia 

11

proposed. 

12
13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
go 

14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

No, no, no.  Let me 

Okay.  Yes. 
 step by step.  You 

agree that's clearly established. 

17

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
All right.  What you 

19

don't think is clearly established is a mixed motive 

20

case. 

21

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's correct. 
That's a different 

23

issue.  So the question here is:  Is this a mixed motive 

24

case or not? 

25

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That  the other side, 

2

I think, is saying it's not, that there was no valid 

3

security reason, no objective security reason for this 

4

move. 

5

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

And I think our response 

6

to that, Your Honor, is we would agree that's clearly 

7

established.  If there were  if no reasonable officer 

8

could believe there was a security rationale and it was 

9

only on the basis of animus, then it would be clearly 

10

established.  We believe 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's not a mixed motive. 

12

Why  why do you accept the description of that as a 

13

mixed motive case? 

14
15
16

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I don't think that  I 

don't think Justice Sotomayor 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If you agreed with my 

17

hypothetical, the point is it doesn't matter what the 

18

officer's motive was.  It does not matter.  If there's 

19

an objective basis for a traffic stop, even if his sole 

20

motive was discriminatory, the stop is nonetheless 

21

valid.  This is not a mixed motive issue. 

22

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I took Justice 

23

Sotomayor to be asking me a different question:  If 

24

there is no objective security rationale, which takes it 

25

out of Your Honor's hypo, then we agree it is clearly

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

established and we believe this complaint fails because 

2

they have failed to satisfy Iqbal. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Then don't  just don't 

4

call it mixed motive.  It confuses everything.  It 

5

confuses everything. 

6

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

No, that I don't think is 

7

mixed motive.  But what Justice Sotomayor was asking 

8

was, I thought, something different, which is that 

9

whether there is a sort of Mount Healthy butfor 

10

causation.  And I would say  I just want to be very 

11

clear what our position is here.  I know I'm being asked 

12

on the merits, but just to get our the position on 

13

qualified immunity. 

14

 It is not clearly established that taking 

15

viewpoint discrimination into account in a security 

16

situation violates the Constitution.  It is not clearly 

17

established that if there is objective security 

18

rationale, even if you act then in animus, that that 

19

would violate the Constitution. 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

23

been trying to get a question in. 

24

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Justice 
But we agree 
Justice Alito has 

I'm sorry, Your Honor. 
No, no.  It's certainly not

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

your fault. 

2

 (Laughter.) 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This question about the 

4

the issue that you've been addressing in response to 

5

Justice Scalia's question.  In  in the Fourth 

6

Amendment context where it is purely  the inquiry is 

7

purely objective, we have case law on what is reasonable 

8

suspicion, what is probable cause.  Now, if you apply 

9

that to a First Amendment case where there  where it's 

10

asserted that there is a security  there may or may 

11

not be a security concern, would it not be necessary for 

12

us to identify a  a degree of suspicion or probable 

13

cause that the Secret Service would have to have before 

14

making  before moving people for security reasons? 

15

 I imagine whenever the President is out in 

16

public, there is some degree of risk.  You want no risk? 

17

You know, keep him in a bunker.  So at some point  do 

18

you see what I'm saying?  They 

19

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I do, Your Honor. 
The Secret Service has to 

21

make a decision about how much information they need 

22

before they can  they should move people or change a 

23

route or something like that.  So the courts would then 

24

have to set that standard. 

25

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I think it

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would have to be a very deferential standard and it 

2

would  and I think that that is proper under this 

3

Court's case law. 

4

 If I could attack that in sort of two ways. 

5

The way the Court addressed this issue in Reichle we 

6

think is quite parallel to how it would address it in 

7

this First Amendment context.  What the Court said in 

8

Reichle was:  First, the existence of probable cause in 

9

that case is likely to be an issue in every  in 

10

virtually every case.  And we think in this situation, 

11

the existence of a legitimate objective security 

12

rationale, in part because that's what the agents do and 

13

in part because of statute that  that requires the 

14

agency to protect the President, a legitimate security 

15

rationale is likely to be in every case first. 

16

 Second, what the Court said in Reichle was 

17

that it's very difficult to distinguish animus from the 

18

proper use of reliance on protected speech because 

19

because the Court has recognized that it is valid at 

20

times to take into account the nature of one's speech 

21

in  in making arrests and other security decisions. 

22

And the same would be true here. 

23

 And we think there's a third factor here 

24

which is important, which this Court has recognized, 

25

that the physical security of the President occupies a

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

special place in our constitutional structure, as 

2

Justice Breyer put it in his Rubin dissent, and that the 

3

Secret Service has a special role to play. 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would you say that under 

5

your view of the case, that there is a First Amendment 

6

interest that protesters have, but that it is virtually 

7

unenforceable in the context of crowd control? 

8
9
10
11
12

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

No, Your Honor, we would 

not say that.  We think there are 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Because it seems to me 

that if this complaint doesn't survive, nothing will. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I'd like 

13

to address that in a couple of different ways.  First of 

14

all, there's a very big difference between whether 

15

there's a Bivens action stated and whether there are 

16

other ways to enforce constitutional rights.  So it is 

17

possible and there have been suits that have sought 

18

injunctive and declaratory relief before things like 

19

inaugurations, political conventions, even just regular 

20

presidential visits.  Those would be unaffected. 

21

 Second, there are  there are situations in 

22

which plaintiffs, and there are pending challenges now, 

23

have challenged Secret Service policies, for example a 

24

Secret Service policy that no  that bars certain 

25

supports for signs from a parade route.  That's being

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

challenged now in the court. 
 And then if there are Bivens claims, we 

3

think there are allegations that would survive.  But we 

4

do recognize that this would  that  that a ruling on 

5

qualified immunity here would cut back on damages claims 

6

against individual agents, but we think that's 

7

appropriate in light of the difficulties they face.  The 

8

agent 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You know, I really  I 

10

really don't understand what the government is doing 

11

here.  It seems to me you want to win this case, but not 

12

too big. 

13

 (Laughter.) 

14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Your Honor 
In  in light of the 

16

arguments waived below and the arguments not made here, 

17

you want us to find for you, but on the narrowest 

18

possible ground.  I would think it is in the interest of 

19

the United States and the Secret Service to say there 

20

are no Bivens First Amendment actions, but you don't 

21

make that argument.  Didn't make it below; don't make it 

22

here. 

23

 Likewise, it would be in their interest to 

24

say, oh, this is just like a traffic stop.  It doesn't 

25

matter whether we had a  a bad motive so long as there

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was an objective reason, that's the end, but you don't 

2

make that argument here either.  I  I really can't 

3

understand what the government is trying to do here. 

4

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, we are  we 

5

are doing our best to make with the arguments that we 

6

have before the Court.  We think that the  that the 

7

qualified immunity standards that we have articulated 

8

and the position on clearly established law we have 

9

taken is sufficient for this Court to decide the claim. 

10

Although.  As I've tried to say, we agree with both of 

11

the propositions that Your Honor has said and in a 

12

properly preserved case we would be likely to address 

13

them. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Gershengorn, suppose 

15

that we changed the facts here and that both the 

16

proBush demonstrators and the antiBush demonstrators 

17

were in the same place and they were at the foot of the 

18

alleyway, so that there was an objective security 

19

rationale, but that the Secret Service members  and 

20

they were in all respects the same except that they had 

21

different signs.  Some signs say the President is great 

22

and some signs say the President is terrible.  And the 

23

Secret Service members had only removed the ones with 

24

the signs that said the President is terrible. 

25

 So what would your analysis of that be, both

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under the clearly established, but also, I want you to 

2

get to what you think the law is there. 

3

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

All right.  So under 

4

under clearly established, Your Honor, I think we do 

5

think that that would make a plausible case that there 

6

 that the agents acted without a valid security 

7

rationale because they  because they moved the 

8

antiBush protesters, but not the proBush. 

9
10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I think you're changing my 

hypothetical, or let me just explain my hypothetical. 

11

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Okay. 
I put them both at the foot 

13

of the alleyway because that meant that both have a 

14

straight shot, you know, that they can throw a grenade 

15

into the patio, which is, I take it, what the nature of 

16

your objective security consideration is.  So that's 

17

true of both of them.  But you only move the ones that 

18

say the President is terrible. 

19

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So we would say, Your 

20

Honor, first on clearly established, that it is not 

21

clearly established that the Agency couldn't do that, 

22

but we recognize that the Court is  is concerned about 

23

that situation where an agent  an agent has a 

24

legitimate  an objective security rationale, but acts 

25

solely on the basis of animus and I think it would

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

support that kind of inference.  But I would urge the 

2

Court to think, as it thinks about it about the flip 

3

case, which is an agent who has an objective security 

4

rationale 

5
6
7
8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But just  just tell me 

what your answer to that case is.  What do you think 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

The answer is it would not 

be clearly established, that they 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And do you think it would be 

unlawful?  Forget clearly established. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

The government's position 

12

is if  although we haven't briefed it in this case 

13

the government's position would be the one articulated 

14

by Justice Scalia.  But we recognize that is not 

15

something that the Court has yet held and so I think 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I don't think that's 

17

responsive to Justice Kagan's hypothetical.  Justice 

18

Scalia's hypothetical, there is an objective reason for 

19

stopping the car.  It's violating traffic regulations, 

20

which is the broken taillight.  I understood my 

21

colleague's question to be there is no objective 

22

security rationale. 

23

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I'm sorry.  I had 

24

understood it differently.  Did you believe  I thought 

25

you were saying there was an objective 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I said both can throw a 

2

grenade into the patio area, but in fact you only remove 

3

the people who have the antiPresident sign 

4

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

6
7

So I took the fact 
 notwithstanding that the 

security consideration applies to both equally. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So I took that to be that 

8

there is an objective security rationale, and I think in 

9

that situation, we would say that the  A, it's not 

10

clearly established  but that we believe that the 

11

better answer is the one from Justice Scalia because 

12

there's an objective security rationale. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, no.  I thought 

14

the question was there's no differential security 

15

rationale.  In other words, maybe it's not the question 

16

my colleague asked, but I'll 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, that is. 
 I'll ask it. 
Okay. 
Let's say you have 

21

to move the President in an emergency situation.  You've 

22

got two options, go through the antiBush crowd or go 

23

through the proBush crowd, and you've got to do it 

24

right away.  Is it a justified security rationale to say 

25

that we think it's more likely that it will be

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

problematic if you evacuate the President through the 

2

antiBush crowd than through the proBush crowd? 

3
4
5

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

We do not think that would 

be unconstitutional, Your Honor.  But 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So in other words, 

6

the viewpoint itself constitutes a security 

7

consideration? 

8
9
10
11

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That's what this Court 

said in Reichle, that there are times, not that it 
inevitably 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And so, your answer to 

12

Justice Kagan is that it would be proper if you have 

13

only 15 minutes, a limited amount of time, to move the 

14

people with the  with the adverse  with the signs 

15

that criticize the President? 

16
17
18

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That's correct, Your 

Honor.  We think that that 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So your answer to Justice 

19

Kagan is that there is no violation if they move just 

20

the Bush protesters.  That's your answer. 

21

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That's correct, Your 

22

Honor.  But I  and if I could just say a word or two 

23

about the 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't know  I 

thought what the Chief was going to say, there's no

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

differential reason to move one or the other.  Let's 

2

assume you have an equal amount of time, you can get 

3

everybody moved, and you just are choosing to move the 

4

Bush  antiBush demonstrators. 

5

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I understand 

6

that this is an unattractive hypothetical for the 

7

government's position.  And if I could explain why 

8

nonetheless I think it's the right answer because the 

9

flip side is if you have an agent who has a legitimate 

10

security rationale and is going to move against somebody 

11

who's hostile  who's showing a message that's hostile 

12

to the President, you don't want that agent to hesitate. 

13

That's what this Court said in Hunter.  The Court said 

14

in Hunter there are times when we don't want a 

15

reasonable official to hesitate before he acts and 

16

nowhere is that more important than when the specter of 

17

presidential assassination is in order. 

18

 But I want to be crystal clear that we don't 

19

need that  I think I've said that before, but I just want to 

20

make sure  that we don't that to win.  It just has to 

21

be clearly established.  If I could 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I mean, suppose I add to my 

23

hypothetical and I say  and the Secret Service goes to 

24

the local police and says  and, you know, doesn't talk 

25

about grenades at all and really just says we have got

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to get these antiPresident people out of here because 

2

they're annoying the President; let's do it right now, 

3

and that's what they do. 

4

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I think, Your Honor, that 

5

at some point you would cross over into a position where 

6

you would say there  there is a real question about 

7

whether there's an objective security rationale and we 

8

would be in a situation 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, there is one.  I mean, 

10

there is one in a sense of as we look back, we can see 

11

that there's an alleyway and that somebody could have a 

12

grenade, but there is evidence that that's not at all 

13

what was in the heads of the Secret Service members. 

14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I recognize 

15

that that is  as I said, I think that is a  that is 

16

the  the hardest case for us and I recognize that's 

17

why Your Honor posed it.  But I urge Your Honor to think 

18

about from the flip side, which is if you adopted the 

19

rule that Your Honor's question would  not attributing 

20

to you, but might lead one to adopt, that the result is 

21

an agent who has a legitimate security rationale but is 

22

operating against people who are expressing a viewpoint 

23

must hesitate. 

24
25

 And I think it's important in this context 
to remember that what we have are Secret Service agents

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

who are making onthespot judgments while protecting 

2

highlevel officials. 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We understand that and I 

4

think that that's the problem, and I think you're being 

5

sort of picked at for this reason in my mind, and I 

6

don't know if you have an answer to this.  I know 

7

everyone understands the importance of guarding the 

8

President in this country.  Everyone understands the 

9

danger.  You can't run a risk.  At the same time, no one 

10

wants a Praetorian Guard that is above the law, and we 

11

have examples of history of what happens when you do 

12

that.  So everyone is looking for some kind of line that 

13

permits the protection but denies the Praetorian Guard. 

14

And if you have anything to say that we're immersed in 

15

details about how to get to that general objective, I 

16

would love to hear it from either side. 

17

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, very briefly, 

18

then I'd like to reserve.  I think the simplest way to 

19

reserve it is actually  to resolve this, is to hold 

20

that it's not clearly established, that it's a mixed 

21

motive case; it is not clearly established that the 

22

situation Justice Scalia posed would be 

23

unconstitutional; and that under Iqbal, that the 

24

plaintiffs have not alleged what they would need to 

25

allege under clearly established law, that it was the

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sole motive for their actions and there was no 

2

objectively reasonable security rationale. 

3

 I'd like to reserve the balance, Your Honor. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Wilker. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. WILKER 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

8

 MR. WILKER: 

9

please the Court: 

10

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 The Plaintiffs have pled a plausible claim 

11

for intentional viewpoint discrimination in violation of 

12

core First Amendment principles.  We have done so for 

13

three interrelated reasons and we've pled it as a sole 

14

cause.  This was solely the cause, not security 

15

rationale, but the sole cause of the move here was the 

16

viewpoint being expressed. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Would you have taken the 

18

same position if all that had been was the first move, 

19

that is, the move to Fourth Street?  Then there would 

20

have been about an equal distance from the proPresident 

21

demonstrators. 

22

 MR. WILKER: 

I think that would be a more 

23

difficult case for us to prevail because we wouldn't 

24

have one of the prongs on which we rely, which is the 

25

disparate treatment as one of the factors we rely on to

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

establish the inference of intent. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, then would you say 

3

that you would have no tenable case if they moved them 

4

just the one street over so they wouldn't be in a 

5

position to throw a hand grenade to the patio? 

6

 MR. WILKER: 

I think as a practical matter, 

7

we would probably  we would likely not have as tenable 

8

a case as we do.  If in fact the only reason for the 

9

move was the officer's intent to move the antiBush 

10

demonstrators further from where they were so that they 

11

could be heard less well, that would in our view state a 

12

claim for relief.  It would be a more difficult claim 

13

because we are trying to establish intent and we're 

14

trying to establish intent from the inferences from the 

15

various facts that occurred that evening. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Counsel, do you acknowledge 

17

that  that the issue here is whether the law was 

18

clearly established?  Do you agree with that? 

19

 MR. WILKER: 

I think the  I think we 

20

believe the law was clearly established by this Court's 

21

precedents. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm not saying whether you 

23

believe it is.  Is that the  if you find it wasn't 

24

clearly established, do you lose, is what I'm saying? 

25

 MR. WILKER: 

Well, I think this Court's

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

qualified immunity precedents make that clear. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  Now, how can it be 

3

clearly established if we have never held that there is 

4

a Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment 

5

violation?  We've never held that, have we?  How can you 

6

possibly say that the violation here is clearly 

7

established. 

8
9

 MR. WILKER: 

I think you can, Justice 

Scalia, hold  find from this Court's decisions in its 

10

viewpoint discrimination holdings, like Rosenberger, 

11

like R.A.V. v. St. Paul, like Pinette, where the Court 

12

has clearly made it clear that viewpoint discrimination 

13

is a pernicious form 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, it is pernicious.  But 

15

is there a Bivens action for it?  The Constitution does 

16

not create a cause of action for this.  1983 doesn't 

17

cover this.  We invented it out of  really out of 

18

nothing, and we have not extended that to First 

19

Amendment violations up to now. 

20
21
22

 MR. WILKER: 

Up to now.  And that argument 

was not made below, nor preserved to 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, regardless of whether 

23

it was made below, it certainly goes to the argument 

24

that was made below and here, that the violation here 

25

was not clearly established.

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. WILKER: 

Well, I think it's different to 

2

say whether or not there is a remedy for the violation 

3

as to whether the violation was clearly established. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

 MR. WILKER: 

Well, okay. 
The violation was clearly 

6

established.  Whether or not there is a remedy for that 

7

violation under Bivens 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

 MR. WILKER: 

That's a good point. 
 is a different question. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's a good point. 
Mr. Wilker, let's 

12

say something happens back in the patio area where 

13

you  you're the head of the Secret Service detail. 

14

You've got to evacuate the President right away.  Do you 

15

go through the antiBush crowd or through the proBush 

16

crowd?  You've got to decide right now quickly.  I'm 

17

serious.  You have to make a splitsecond decision. 

18

Which way do you go? 

19
20
21

 MR. WILKER: 

I think whichever way provides 

the clearest egress. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no.  They are 

22

both the same.  That was one of your propositions, that 

23

there is no way to distinguish there. 

24
25

 It's too late. 

You've taken too long to 

decide.  It's a serious point.

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. WILKER: 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

3
4

It is a serious point. 
You've got to decide 

like that. 
 MR. WILKER: 

But that's not the position 

5

that  that's not the position the agents were in on 

6

October 14, 2004. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No.  I know.  But if 

8

we're trying to decide whether viewpoint can ever be a 

9

security justification, we have to consider all of the 

10
11

possible situations. 
 So again, if you had to decide right now do 

12

you go through the antiBush crowd or the proBush 

13

crowd?  Guns are going off, explosions.  Which way do 

14

you go? 

15
16

 MR. WILKER: 

I truly don't know the answer 

to your question because I'm not 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 MR. WILKER: 

Really? 

 a security expert.  I don't 

19

know where the guns are coming from.  I don't know what 

20

the 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You're the farthest thing 

22

from a security expert if you don't know the answer to 

23

that one. 

24

 (Laughter.) 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's actually not much

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of an answer for lots of reasons, but the most, if you 

2

don't know, how are we supposed to know? 

3

 MR. WILKER: 

Well, because that's not the 

4

issue that's presented to this Court for decision today. 

5

We're  this is not a case in which the Secret Service 

6

made a splitsecond judgment as to which evacuation 

7

route to take with the President. 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

Well, but with 

respect, my point is that we do have to adopt a general 

10

principle, and if we say viewpoint can never be a 

11

consideration, then you have to say when there is an 

12

emergency going on, it's just as likely there will be a 

13

problem if we go through the proBush demonstrators or 

14

the anti ones, which seems to me to be, on its face, 

15

implausible. 

16

 MR. WILKER: 

Well, in the context of an 

17

emergency, there may be a different rule than there 

18

would be in the context of a considered decision to take 

19

viewpoint into account in making a decision, which is 

20

what we have alleged here. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So then you think 

22

there  well, there may be situations in which 

23

viewpoint alone may be a security consideration. 

24
25

 MR. WILKER: 

There may be.  And I think if 

there were individuals directly in proximity to the

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

President, not, you know, 90 feet or 80 feet away, but 

2

directly, could the Secret Service take into account, I 

3

think that's what this Court said in Reichle, is that 

4

the Court can into account where it said in the 

5

proximity of the President, or in that case the Vice 

6

President.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Wilker, do you concede 

8

that, looking back on this just in a hindsight kind of way, 

9

that there is an objective security rationale here, that 

10

they are standing at the foot of the alleyway, that you 

11

could throw a grenade into the patio area?  Do you 

12

concede that just looking at the situation and not 

13

thinking, not taking into account any evidence of what 

14

was in their heads, that there in fact is an objective 

15

security rationale for moving people from this area? 

16

 MR. WILKER: 

I think if you  if the 

17

concern was the mouth of the alley and that the riot 

18

geared police guarding the mouth of the alley were not 

19

sufficient to protect the alley and protect against that 

20

kind of incursion, the more simple solution in this case 

21

would simply be to move people slightly to the east or 

22

west where they had buildings between them and the 

23

President. 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The question is, what is 

there are so many different theories floating in this

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case that I've had a hard time trying to figure out what 

2

you want me to decide  on what theory you want me to 

3

decide.  Is your allegation that the Secret Service 

4

agents were motivated in part by security reasons and in 

5

part by bad  what you would say, bad viewpoint 

6

reasons?  Or is your theory the Secret Service was 

7

motivated only by viewpoint and zero by security? 

8

 MR. WILKER: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's the latter. 
It's the latter.  Okay.  So 

10

then if it is the latter, I think you're hearing the 

11

government saying, yes, that is clearly established, 

12

that they could not in fact be motivated only by bad 

13

viewpoint reasons and zero by security, and therefore, 

14

you have stated a claim, if your complaint does say what 

15

we both just agreed you wanted to say. 

16
17
18
19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't think the 

government has conceded that. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Maybe they 

didn't and I have to decide that. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

conceded that at all. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't think the government 

Okay.  Then I would have to 

23

decide is it the case that if the Secret  if the 

24

Secret Service was motivated not at all by security and 

25

a 100 percent by viewpoint, does that state a claim?

36

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

Now, we'd running into the Bivens problem, et cetera. 
 But leaving all that out of it, the next 

3

question would be, which I haven't heard argued yet, 

4

which is why I raised this, what more do you have to do 

5

than state a claim?  5 years ago, I would have thought 

6

nothing, that if you have an absurd claim, I'm not 

7

saying it's absurd, but if it were absurd, a district 

8

court could deal with that.  They would deal with it by 

9

giving you 5 minutes of discovery and then saying hum, 

10

or 10 minutes plus summary judgment.  Or have you really 

11

certified this under Rule 11?  Are you kidding?  Be 

12

careful.  Or you know, they have five or six different 

13

weapons.  Now, that is what you're arguing, I think. 

14

But then along comes Iqbal. 

15

 MR. WILKER: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17
18

Uhhuh. 
Now, it's a long way of 

focusing you on that question. 
 MR. WILKER: 

And so in Iqbal, this Court 

19

said to be plausible it has to be something more than 

20

possible.  But it  plausibility is not probability. 

21

And the way we establish intent is rarely through the 

22

admission to a local law enforcement or to someone else 

23

that the agent acted for an impermissible reason. 

24

 What we do to establish intent is plead 

25

facts from which intent can be inferred.  We believe we

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have pled  pleaded facts from which intent can be 

2

inferred, both with respect to the disparate treatment, 

3

with respect to the time that elapsed from the 

4

President's decision to dine, from the time he sat down, 

5

and then 15 more minutes until the decision was made to 

6

move the demonstrators. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, Iqbal says a 

8

little bit more than that, not that you just have to 

9

allege facts.  In Iqbal, and just quoting here from page 

10

681, the Court goes on to consider the factual 

11

allegations in the complaint to determine if they 

12

plausibly suggest an entitlement, and they go on to say, 

13

but given more likely explanations, they do not 

14

plausibly establish this purpose. 

15

 So based on just your complaint, we have to 

16

determine whether there are more likely explanations. 

17

And we have in your complaint the idea that they are at 

18

the front of the alleyway, it's a sixfoot wooden fence. 

19

Can we  we certainly can look at those in deciding not 

20

simply whether you've pled the cause of action, but 

21

whether it's more plausible than those other 

22

justifications. 

23

 MR. WILKER: 

I think, though, once we meet a 

24

certain threshold of plausibility, unless the competing 

25

inference is so compelling to make our claim

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

implausible, that it involves at the pleading stage such 

2

a great burden that no plaintiff could ever satisfy it. 

3

The Secret Service or any defendant could always 

4

could always articulate some rationale for their action 

5

that would create a competing inference. 

6
7
8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's what we said 

in 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Wilker, sorry to take 

you back to this, but in this 

10

 MR. WILKER: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right. 
 case, do you concede that 

12

a reasonable officer, even if not these officers, these 

13

officers might have had a terrible motivation, but that 

14

a reasonable officer could look at this map and say, 

15

look at the distance between the alley and the outdoor 

16

patio, you can throw an explosive in there, that seems 

17

really bad, let's get these people out of the way? 

18

Could a reasonable officer have said that? 

19

 MR. WILKER: 

Could a reasonable officer have 

20

said that, that given the proximity?  Certainly that's a 

21

possible conclusion.  I can't say that that's an 

22

impossible conclusion. 

23

 But the answer to that  it doesn't, 

24

because the answer to that is to take a measured 

25

response consistent with the Secret Service's own

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

guidelines, which is not to take viewpoint into account, 

2

to be respectful of those First Amendment rights of 

3

people who are demonstrating on the public streets in 

4

the center of town.  This is core. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And have you  you've 

6

conceded that there would be a security interest, in the 

7

hypothetical that Justice Kagan raised, that there are 

8

 people are in front of that alley where they could 

9

throw a grenade.  Once you concede that, then you say, 

10

but the security interest, the valid security interest 

11

is washed away because, in fact, it was reported. 

12

 MR. WILKER: 

I think there's a distinction. 

13

Could there be a security interest?  Yes, there could 

14

hypothetically be one.  Was there one?  We say there was 

15

not, for the reasons articulated in our briefs and for 

16

the constellation of facts that we have alleged in our 

17

complaint. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm not sure I understand 

19

that, because it seems to me there either is or isn't a 

20

valid security interest.  Now, whether they acted 

21

because of that valid security interest is, of course, a 

22

different question, and you might say, well, there was a 

23

valid security interest, but that's not why they acted. 

24
25

 But as to the first question, I mean, there 
either is one or there isn't one, no?  And we look at it

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and we say, what would a reasonable police officer think 

2

of the security interest here?  What would a reasonable 

3

police officer do?  Would he clear this area or not? 

4

 MR. WILKER: 

The  the question is whether 

5

proximity alone of a peaceful group of protesters is 

6

enough to create a security; and in hindsight, you could 

7

look at that and you could conclude that.  I 

8

respectfully disagree that that means there was one on 

9

the evening in question.  That's a factual question. 

10
11

Was there, in fact 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You say in your complaint, 

12

"The Defendants claim that Defendant Secret Service 

13

agents told Tao and the police defendants that the 

14

reason for the Secret Service's request or direction was 

15

that they did not want anyone within handgun or 

16

explosive range of the President.  To the extent the 

17

agents, in fact, made such an assertion, the assertion 

18

was false, and the Defendant Tao and police defendants 

19

knew or should have known that it was false." 

20

 So you think it's false. 

They think it's 

21

true.  That's called a dispute of fact.  And the normal 

22

circumstance is that the judge has various weapons at 

23

his disposal, legal weapons, to try to prevent  to try 

24

to prevent court's time being wasted, officer's time 

25

being wasted and other's time being wasted on factual

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

allegations that are unlikely to be true.  That was true 

2

before Iqbal as well as after.  That's your position, 

3

isn't it? 

4

 MR. WILKER: 

Well, yes and no.  I mean, I 

5

think "unlikely" may be the wrong word.  And this case 

6

in  Court in Swierkiewicz said it doesn't matter 

7

whether the case  it's not a question of whether the 

8

case is likely to be proven true.  The question is have 

9

you pled enough.  Now, clearly that preceded Iqbal, but 

10

Iqbal didn't purport to change that calculus. 

11

Ultimately, we are still at the pleading stage.  We 

12

believe we have pled enough facts to create a basis for 

13

the inference of intent. 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what about the other 

15

situation, which is similar to your case but not exactly 

16

similar  not exactly the same.  You don't plead any 

17

evidence of direct intent  any direct evidence of 

18

intent on the part of the officers, but you have two 

19

groups.  One's pro, one's anti, and the officers put one 

20

group one place and one group the other place.  Now, the 

21

distance from the President to the two groups is not the 

22

same.  One is somewhat closer, one is somewhat farther 

23

away.  The  the things that are in between the group 

24

and the President are different.  Maybe in the group 

25

that's further away, you might think the things are 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they might  one might think that there are fewer 

2

obstructions, maybe there are more obstructions on the 

3

other side.  So you plead that the  the placement of 

4

the antigroup was less favorable than placement of the 

5

progroup and is that enough? 

6
7

 MR. WILKER: 

We acknowledge that's not 

enough under this Court's precedence. 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

9

 MR. WILKER: 

10
11

What more do you need? 
We  we do need to allege 

personal participation and intent.  We understand 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, you  you plead 

12

intent.  Would you be  if you pled intent based just 

13

on the disparate impact, would you be in violation of 

14

Rule 11? 

15

 MR. WILKER: 

I don't  I don't think we'd 

16

be in violation of Rule 11.  I don't know that under 

17

Iqbal that that would be enough.  I think prior to 

18

Iqbal, that would have been enough. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

20

 MR. WILKER: 

What more would you need? 
I think you need other evidence 

21

from which you can infer an intent and we've pled other 

22

evidence.  One is the time that elapsed from the time 

23

the decision was made, which lessens the  which 

24

suggests and supports the inference  supports the 

25

inference that it wasn't a securitybased determination,

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

but, in fact, was based on a viewpoint animus. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

we're talking about the 15 minutes between 

4

 MR. WILKER: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6
7

Just to make sure, 

We're talking about both. 
Between when and 

when? 
 MR. WILKER: 

So we're talking about the time 

8

the President made the decision and  and the initial 

9

security arrangements were made approximately at 7 

10

o'clock. 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

 MR. WILKER: 

Right. 

Then the President sat down at 

13

approximately 7:15, and then another 15 minutes elapsed 

14

before the decision is made to  to move the antiBush 

15

demonstrators. 

16
17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

they first cleared the alley, right? 

18

 MR. WILKER: 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

20

And the first 

Yes. 
And then the 

movement that you're concerned about. 

21

 MR. WILKER: 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right. 
Now, doesn't it make 

23

sense, just hypothetically, if you're the Secret Service 

24

agent and you suddenly have this challenge dropped in 

25

your lap at the last minute, you say, okay, here's the

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thing, the first thing we've got to do is clear the 

2

alley, right, because that's right up against where he's 

3

standing.  So you take care of that.  You clear the 

4

alley.  Then after you have more time to assess the 

5

situation, you say, okay, now we've got to get these 

6

people who are at the foot of the alley, we've got to 

7

move them. 

8
9
10
11

 In other words, they had to act not in an 
emergency situation, but reasonably quickly and they did 
it step by step. 
 MR. WILKER: 

And we understand that's the 

12

competing inference that the government has offered 

13

here.  We respectfully disagree that on the facts that 

14

we've alleged that that's so compelling that it renders 

15

our allegation implausible. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But here's where we 

17

get back to Iqbal.  It doesn't have to be so compelling. 

18

It simply has to be more likely, is the quote from Iqbal 

19

on 681, and it has to be an obvious alternative 

20

explanation.  And that's enough, no matter what you've 

21

alleged. 

22

 MR. WILKER: 

But we rely on the language 

23

elsewhere in Iqbal, which we think has to be read 

24

together, which is, plausibility doesn't mean 

25

probability.  And so if  if the contention is that if

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there's a more likely explanation, ours is then 

2

then  then we're being held to a probability standard 

3

that this Court said we weren't being held to on a 

4

pleading standard, and which we would suggest to the 

5

Court is not consistent with Rule 8 with a short and 

6

plain statement of the claim.  Again, we haven't had an 

7

opportunity to develop a factual record here. 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  How do you do 

that?  Because I want to follow up on just what the 

10

Chief Justice said.  Imagine that what he just said is 

11

the real case.  You have a client, imagine, who's quite 

12

sincere, absolutely sincere, and really feels he was 

13

very badly treated, and you can sign a Rule 11 

14

statement, but suppose that the facts are just what he 

15

said.  Then suppose that Iqbal were not the law.  Forget 

16

Iqbal for the moment. 

17

 Now, you've got my hypothetical. 

18

 MR. WILKER: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think so. 
All right.  What weapons 

20

does the district judge have, which I have so blithely 

21

been assuming, to prevent a waste of time by the Secret 

22

Service, a demoralization of the service leaning in the 

23

direction of being overly careful and therefore risking 

24

the President.  What procedural weapons does the present 

25

law, absent Iqbal, give him to dispose of a case quickly

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

without disturbance if the true facts are what the Chief 

2

Justice said? 

3

 MR. WILKER: 

Well, I think there has to be 

4

some opportunity to develop a factual record.  And the 

5

trial courts have ample authority to control discovery 

6

under the Rules of Civil Procedure. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So discovery is your 

8

answer.  And of course it is.  You've got allegations. 

9

You're going to go to trial.  The first thing you're 

10

going to do is file interrogatories, you're going to 

11

file requests for admission, you're going to file 

12

discovery requests to the Secret Service.  And the 

13

district court's going to have to allow some of that, 

14

isn't he, if he's allowed your allegations to go 

15

forward? 

16

 MR. WILKER: 

I think  I think the Court 

17

would have to permit us to engage in some discovery of 

18

the agents regarding are there reports of the events of 

19

the evening?  Do they admit certain facts or deny them? 

20

Should we have an opportunity to take brief depositions 

21

of the agents?  And I think those are appropriate steps. 

22

That's not full and unbridled discovery.  The rules 

23

already limit discovery to a certain degree.  The 

24

presumptive limits on depositions.  They 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But what about  what

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

about the 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The first thing 

3

you'd want  I say the first thing you'd want to know 

4

is whether this was a departure from established policy. 

5

So the first question in  if I were drafting 

6

interrogatories would be, what is your policy with 

7

respect to moving demonstrators at a presidential event? 

8

What do you do?  And I can see the Secret Service 

9

saying, well, that's kind of a bad thing to make it 

10

public because there are people out there who want to 

11

kill the President, and if you go through your discovery 

12

and say, this is how we look at that situation, this is 

13

what we do, that gives people a  a guideline for how 

14

to break through the security arrangements. 

15

 MR. WILKER: 

Well, the court  the trial 

16

courts, the district courts have  also have ample 

17

authority to enter protective orders.  There has been no 

18

assertion that the information that would be required 

19

here, and we don't know because we haven't gotten to 

20

that stage, and I think it's premature to get to that 

21

stage whether there would be any claims of secrecy that 

22

would limit what we could or could not do in the context 

23

of discovery.  But those are matters that can be best 

24

addressed by the district court in the first instance, 

25

and can be addressed by the normal and appropriate means

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that district courts use all the time to address 

2

sensitive information when it's presented as part of the 

3

lawsuit in Federal court. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What  then what does 

5

happen if a district court does allow discovery of 

6

things what the Secret Service thinks are confidential? 

7

Under certain  how far should demonstrators be away 

8

from the President?  How high must a fence be before we 

9

think that it provides security against a thrown object? 

10

Suppose the district court allows discovery of all of 

11

that.  What are they supposed to do? 

12

 They have to file a mandamus petition with 

13

the court of appeals and get  have the court of 

14

appeals  try to persuade the court of appeals to 

15

review a discovery order? 

16

 MR. WILKER: 

I think that ultimately is one 

17

remedy and it's a remedy provided for in our system 

18

whenever we have an issue in which sensitive information 

19

may be involved in connection with a Federal lawsuit. 

20

That's not  it's not an answer to say that simply 

21

because there might be some information that the Secret 

22

Service would rather not share, that that should stop us 

23

in our tracks to begin with.  Those are the kinds of 

24

determinations that a district court should be trusted 

25

to make in the first instance and which district judges

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

make every day in this country. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

There was  in Judge 

3

Berzon's opinion, she seemed to think it was very 

4

important that when the President got into the motorcade 

5

to leave only one side had access.  So leaving aside 

6

what happened when the group was moved, would you take the 

7

position that not moving them back before the President 

8

left was a violation of their First Amendment rights? 

9

 MR. WILKER: 

We have not taken that 

10

position.  We have not asserted that they had  that 

11

there was an obligation to hold the President in 

12

position so that the demonstrators could be moved back 

13

to their former position. 

14

 Our position is they shouldn't have been 

15

moved in the first place, because there wasn't a valid 

16

security reason and that the reason they were moved was 

17

solely because of the viewpoint they were expressing. 

18

And the fact that that's not a separate claim that they 

19

weren't moved back, but it is an indication that they 

20

were removed from where the President would be passing, 

21

in our view, that supports the inference of viewpoint 

22

discrimination. 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The question of mixed 

24

motive or improper motive, if we can get back to that 

25

for just a minute.  Assume that the law  and this is

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Wren case  is as follows.  If there is improper 

2

motive for an arrest, but that there was an objective 

3

basis that would have made the arrest and that did make 

4

the arrest reasonable, there is no violation of the 

5

Constitution. 

6

 Assume that's the law and forget clearly 

7

established, forget  assume that's the law.  It seems 

8

to me that for you to prevail, you have to say we should 

9

make a First Amendment exception because the First 

10

Amendment is so important.  Or that there has to be, in 

11

another context, an amendment for racial profiling.  So 

12

that the rule that I have just stated has to be 

13

qualified in some way.  It seems to me you almost have 

14

to say that in order to prevail in this case. 

15

 MR. WILKER: 

I would suggest to you that 

16

Wren is the exception, that Wren in the Fourth Amendment 

17

context, that says if there is an objective  if there is 

18

an objective basis, I think that's reflected in Reichle. 

19

But as the Court in Iqbal noted, in the First and Fifth 

20

Amendment context, at least in the context of State 

21

actors, the Court has held that invidious intent is a 

22

basis for liability.  Intent to violate those 

23

constitutional rights is a basis, and so 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  I'm not sure. 

If you stop a car because you think the participants in

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it were coming back from a protest against President 

2

Bush, is that a Fourth Amendment case or a First 

3

Amendment case, if that's your allegation? 

4

 The only reason the car was stopped was 

5

because of the viewpoint that these people have.  Is that a 

6

Fourth Amendment case or a First Amendment case? 

7
8
9

 MR. WILKER: 

No.  That would be a First 

Amendment case. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah, I would think so. 

10

And you think that so long as you make that First 

11

Amendment allegation, it doesn't matter if you have a 

12

broken taillight. 

13

 MR. WILKER: 

I think for the terms of the 

14

First Amendment claim, it wouldn't matter if the 

15

circumstances demonstrated and created a basis for that 

16

inference of intent. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Wow. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Just out of curiosity, was 

19

there anything to prevent someone from leaving one these 

20

groups and going over to the other group? 

21

 MR. WILKER: 

There was after the President 

22

made the decision.  The allegations in the complaint 

23

state that the local law enforcement restricted 

24

movements between the two groups after the security 

25

perimeter was established. 

26

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Somebody couldn't have just

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

walked away and taken a circuitous route and gone to the 

2

other group?  That would have been  the police would 

3

have stopped them from doing that? 

4

 MR. WILKER: 

Is it theoretically possible 

5

that they could have taken a large enough circle around 

6

there?  I think that is a theoretical possibility.  But 

7

the police did in fact stop movement across Third 

8

Street. 

9

 One of the factors that we haven't addressed 

10

today is the Secret Service's actual policy and practice 

11

that we've alleged in our complaint.  And that plausibly 

12

and convincingly supports the inference of intent here. 

13

 We've alleged not less than 12 other 

14

incidents during the first 4 years of the Bush 

15

Administration in which Secret Service agents were 

16

involved in viewpoint suppression activities.  Now, we 

17

haven't proven those, but again we are at the complaint 

18

stage. 

19

 That allegation, along with the official 

20

policy of the Bush White House to suppress dissent at 

21

presidential appearances, also supports the inference 

22

that these officers were acting for a viewpoint 

23

suppressive reason. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I suppose you would 

then seek discovery with respect to those 12 other

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

episodes, because you're saying those are viewpoint 

2

discrimination, how can you decide until you know the 

3

facts of those? 

4

 MR. WILKER: 

We would seek certain limited 

5

discovery with respect to those incidents to see if they 

6

bear out the allegations that we have made. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The same range of 

8

things that we talked about earlier:  Interrogatories, 

9

requests for production, discovery, with respect, not 

10
11

just to your case, but to the 12 others? 
 MR. WILKER: 

To the extent that the Secret 

12

Service denies that those allegations or that these 

13

officers deny those allegations in an answer, which we 

14

haven't yet seen 

15
16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

discovery; you would seek unlimited discovery. 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19
20

You wouldn't seek limited 

You might get only limited 

discovery, but 
 MR. WILKER: 

I'm not sure I would seek 

21

unlimited discovery, because then I might be 

22

overburdened with material that would have no relevance 

23

to the case.  What we would seek is information 

24

sufficient to draw conclusions about those events and 

25

whether they are sufficiently similar to support the

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inference we would seek to establish in this case, that 

2

these officers  these agents acted with the intent we've 

3

alleged they acted with.

Thank you, counsel. 

remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 

11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

12

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

13
14

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice: 
 A couple of points. 

First, I think, Justice 

15

Kagan, in response to your hypothetical, the concession 

16

that in hindsight there may have been a valid security 

17

rationale ends this case, because if it was true in 

18

hindsight, it was certainly true at the time in the kind 

19

of rapid  in the kind of rapid decisionmaking that was 

20

called for, as the Chief Justice alluded to.  I think at 

21

that point the case is over in our favor. 

22

 Second, the kinds of discovery that 

23

my friend on the other side 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

Could I just clarify a 

factual matter.  There are two alleyways.  There was one

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on Third Street that the President went into, and then 

2

there is one by the patio dining room.  What access was 

3

there between Fourth Street and the patio?  Because I 

4

thought that the alley was on California Street, the 

5

entrance to the alley was on California Street. 

6

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

The entry to the alley is 

7

on California Street.  That's the one where the 

8

antiBush demonstrators were.  The alley that the 

9

motorcade went through, which is on Third Street, which 

10

is neither  neither group of protesters could get to because 

11

the police had blocked off traffic north of California 

12

Street so that  no protests, no demonstrators could 

13

get there at all. 

14

 If I could return on the discovery point. 

15

The discovery that my colleague has suggested he would 

16

seek is exactly the nightmare scenario that the Secret 

17

Service fears.  It's exactly what qualified immunity is 

18

designed to prevent.  When there is a legitimate 

19

security rationale, discovery into what the agents were 

20

thinking, what the Secret Service's policies were is 

21

exactly what there shouldn't be.  It's exactly what the 

22

Court said in Hunter that it didn't want, which is 

23

agents hesitating before they did their job. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Gershengorn, suppose 

it's originally set up by the police, the motorcade is

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

coming down, each side has roughly equal access.  Then the 

2

Secret Service comes along and said:  Clear the 

3

antiBush demonstrators.  Suppose that, that  those 

4

were the facts.  Would there be a valid Bivens claim? 

5

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, the question 

6

would depend on whether there was a valid security 

7

rationale.  I think in the context of a motorcade 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The rationale is just it's 

more likely that the people who are against the 

10

President would be harmful to him than the people who 

11

are for him. 

12

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I think that 

13

would be a much more difficult case in the context of a 

14

motorcade where the security of the President is much 

15

different than when the President is on an outdoor patio 

16

separated only by a small fence.  And I do think that 

17

that is one of the major differences between where 

18

the  the treatment of the proBush protesters and the 

19

antiBush protesters here is that the  an allegation 

20

that could be based on differential treatment because 

21

the proBush protesters were in position to see the 

22

motorcade when it left, and therefore, as the complaint 

23

alleges in Paragraph 55, that that somehow undermines 

24

the agents' security rationale for moving the antiBush 

25

protesters during the meal, it just doesn't wash.

57

1

 And then if I could turn just very quickly, 

2

Justice Breyer, to your suggestion that the district 

3

court could  could control discovery.  That's exactly 

4

what the Court rejected in Twombly, exactly what the 

5

Court rejected in Iqbal.  As a practical matter, once 

6

that door is open, the agents lose the security and 

7

peace of mind that they need and they're subjected to 

8

the very burdens they shouldn't be subjected to. 

9

 And then if I could just close with a quick 

10

point on the Iqbal.  We don't think under the 

11

allegations here, as the Chief Justice pointed to the 

12

key passage in Iqbal, that these allegations are any 

13

more than consistent with the obvious alternative 

14

explanation. 

15

 I've addressed the proBush protesters. 

The 

16

diners are very differently situated for a security 

17

perspective because they had no anticipation of seeing 

18

the President, and the Secret Service could screen 

19

additional folks coming in.  It's very different from a 

20

crowd outside an alleyway. 

21
22

25

 The advance manual that the other side 
points to supports us, not them.  What it said is 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You can finish your 

sentence. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

What it says, Your Honor,

58

is that security concerns are for the Secret Service.

If it's a political concern, that's for the advance
