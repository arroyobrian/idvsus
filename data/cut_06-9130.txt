CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

Prisons.

6

Mr. Andre.

7

MR. ANDRE:

8

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the court:

9

The text of Section 26 (a)(c)Federal court

10

claims act establishes -- provision underlying purpose

11

confirm that Congress did not intend the provision to

12

broadly bar all claims arising out of all the tensions

13

of all property by all law enforcement officers.

14

any statutory construction case we need to of course

15

begin with the text, and with respect to the text in

16

this case, we believe that the statutory language is

17

simply no different than the statutory at issue at

18

Circuit City v. Adams.

19

applied a ejusdem generis to limit a sweepingly broad

20

residual phrase that is meaningfully indistinguishable

21

from the "any other law enforcement phrase" at issue

22

here.

23

asked what kinds of employment contracts were exempted

24

from the mandates of the Federal Arbitration Act.

25

particular provision at issue in that case 9 U.S.C.

As in

Circuit City v. Adams this court

In particular, in Circuit City the court was

Section 1 exempted from the act's coverage any and I

2

quote contracts of employment of sea men, railroad

3

5

read in isolation is broad and sweeping on its face it

6

certainly would appear to apply not only to

7

transportation workers, but also to retail store clerks

8

like the Respondent in Circuit City, none the less under

9

a ejusdem generis, this court limited that residual

10

That residual phrase

phrase to just to transportation workers.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose there is a

12

difference between a sufficient laundry list in a

13

residual phrase and example in a residual phrase.

14

Circuit City you have a couple of examples -- seamen,

15

railroad workers -- here it's just a customs or excise

16

worker.

17

thing.

18

said you have an example in a residual phrase; the

19

example is not limiting.

20

In

I regard customs and excise as kind of the same
So why isn't it more like the cases where we've

MR. ANDRE:

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

21

if I could point out that if the Government had made the

22

argument that you have to have a list, and I think under

23

the Government's interpretation you had to have at least

24

three items, two specific and one general.

25

-- Norfolk and Western Railway, this Court says that
4

Alderson Reporting Company

In Norfolk

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

need not be the case.

2

could have a singular general term preceded by a

3

singular specific term.

4

that even if you were to read this statute as -- as

5

possessing only two items, that you could still apply

6

ejusdem generis, but we don't read the statute that way.

7

We believe that the statute actually contains a list of

8

three items, and that Congress to save itself a couple

9

words, decided to say "any officer of customs or excise,

10

or any other law enforcement officer," instead of saying

11

the more wordy version, "any officer of customs, any

12

officer of excise or any other law enforcement officer."

13

I don't think we can fault Congress for its pick in that

14

scenario.

15

There the Court said that you

So it's our position that -

To get back to the residual phrase, the "any

16

other law enforcement officer phrase" here, ripped from

17

its moorings, as we believe the Government is trying to

18

do, would certainly seem to apply to all law enforcement

19

officers, including Bureau of Prisons officials which by

20

statute are law enforcement officers.

21

2680(c) contains a number of contextual cues that

22

Congress didn't have general law enforcement functions

23

in mind when it passed the provision.

24

and tax functions in mind.

25

clause preserves sovereign immunity for the detention of

But Section

It had customs

In particular, the detention

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

goods and merchandise by any officer of customs or

2

excise.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, not just goods

4

or merchandise.

5

And does other property include any type of property?

6

Goods, merchandise or other property.

MR. ANDRE:

We believe it does, and we

7

believe that when Congress added that language it was

8

simply Congress's sensible recognition that customs and

9

tax officers will detain or seize cash and real property

10

which wouldn't be covered or wouldn't be subsumed under

11

goods and merchandise.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So "goods and

13

merchandise or other property" are just examples, and

14

then a residual phrase that includes everything; but

15

"customs or excise or any other law enforcement

16

officer," that's subject to ejusdem generis - all in the

17

same sentence.

18

MR. ANDRE:

Well, we actually don't think -

19

or I guess I cannot necessarily agree with the first

20

part of what you just said, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

believe that -- that other property necessarily, or that

22

"goods and merchandise and other property," the goods

23

and merchandise are examples of "other property."

24

think in that situation, goods and merchandise refer

25

specifically to goods and merchandise as -- as explained
6

Alderson Reporting Company

We don't

We

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

historically in the United States Code, which are, you

2

know, more movable things other than cash, tangible

3

items other than cash, and "other property" then covers

4

cash and real property.

5

Excuse me.

Getting back to the contextual

6

cues in this case, in addition to the four contained in

7

the detention clause itself, the assessment clause

8

contains four additional contextual cues.

9

sovereign immunity for the assessment of any tax or the

It preserves

10

collection of any customs duty, and because we have this

11

great quantity of contextual cues in a very short

12

statutory provision, we believe that we would also

13

prevail under an application of the Noscitur a sociis

14

canon, that this Court most recently applied two terms

15

ago in Dolan v. Postal Service.

16

at issue is whether the term "negligent transmission" in

17

Section 2680(b) of the Federal Tort Claims Act reached

18

all negligent transmissions, in particular a parcel left

19

on the foot of someone's front door that causes them a

20

fall injury, or instead, it was limited by its

21

antecedent contextual cues, namely -- I'm sorry -

22

namely, loss and miscarriage, which would tend to

23

indicate that Congress intended really only to preserve

24

sovereign immunity for instances in which delivery was

25

untimely or went to the wrong location.

In that case what was

7

Alderson Reporting Company

The Court again

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sensibly looked past the superficially broad negligent

2

transmission language and instead said no, we have to

3

read it in context; and in context Congress did not

4

intend us to just pluck those two words out of the

5

dictionary and apply a dictionary meaning.

6

In fact, in that case, the Government

7

implored this Court to apply dictionary definitions to

8

negligence and transmission, and that's essentially what

9

the Government is trying to ask this Court to do here.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, what do you do

11

about the later -- the later statute that makes an

12

exception to the exception?

13

MR. ANDRE:

We don't believe that that

14

changes -- we don't believe that changes the meaning of

15

the detention cause at all beyond the small change that

16

Congress made.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean it clearly, the

18

exception to the exception says that -- that the

19

exception is applicable to any claim based on injury or

20

loss of goods or merchandise, if among other

21

requirements, the property was seized for the purpose of

22

forfeiture under any provision of Federal law providing

23

for the forfeiture of property.

24
25

Now that's more than customs and tax -- any
provision of Federal law.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ANDRE:

Well, Your Honor -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do you need that

3

exception to the exception if the exception doesn't

4

cover anything except customs and tax in the first

5

place?

6

MR. ANDRE:

Well, we believe that the fact

7

that Congress decided to not only preserve the detention

8

clause, but also mimic its language in the exception to

9

the exception, means that Congress intended to kind of

10

bring forward the -- of course -- original meaning as of

11

1946 of that clause.

12

asking me, the Government's position, that because the

13

exception to the exception references any provision of

14

forfeiture -- the Government's suggestion that that

15

somehow broadens the scope of the statute is misplaced.

But I think to get what you're

16

Customs and tax officers regularly apply

17

other forfeiture statutes, and in particular the one

18

they use a lot is 21 U.S.C.

19

civil forfeiture statute.

20

will bring a forfeiture action under either their

21

agency's specific forfeiture provision, or the general

22

21 U.S.C. 881.

23

language saying any provision of forfeiture, it was

24

simply Congress's sensible recognition that they don't

25

--

881.

That's the general

And so in many cases they

And so when Congress included that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They didn't -- they didn't

need that if indeed it covered all seizures by -- by

3

customs and tax officers and nobody else.

4

it -- it covered, what -- you know, this doesn't achieve

5

anything.

6

law.

7

laws other than tax and customs.

8

there is one, one such law that tax and customs officers

9

sometimes use?

10

If that's all

The purpose of under any provision of Federal

It seems to me that that envisions seizure under

MR. ANDRE:

Now you're saying

There may be more, I was giving

11

you an example, but the one that I gave you, 21 U.S.C.

12

881, is the one most frequently used.

13

forfeiture provision.

14

forfeitures, and so in many cases officers bring

15

forfeiture actions not only either -- either under their

16

own agency forfeiture provision or the general.

17

Sometimes they bring them under both.

18

that's a meaty statute there, and I -- I assume that

19

Congress wanted to make clear that if a customs or tax

20

officer were to bring a forfeiture proceeding under that

21

meaty provision, and maybe some other ones that they

22

would use from time to time, that the exception to the

23

exception would still work here.

24
25

It is the general

It's kind of the backbone of all

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the point is

What work does it do?

What

work under your interpretation does that later provision
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

do, if property was seized for the purpose of forfeiture

2

under any provision of Federal law providing for the

3

forfeiture of property?

4

MR. ANDRE:

Under our interpretation, if a

5

customs or tax officer or another law enforcement

6

officer acting in a custom or tax capacity detains

7

property and injures it -- and it doesn't matter under

8

which forfeiture law they detain the property -

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. ANDRE:

Right.

-- and the plaintiff is

11

ultimately successful, I'm sorry, I guess -- yes, the

12

plaintiff is ultimately successful in defeating the

13

Government's claim for forfeiture, then they can sue

14

under the FTCA for the damage to their property.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Andre, it may be that

16

things would fall into place easier if you would give us

17

an example or examples of instances in which any other

18

law enforcement officer would be engaged in detaining

19

property in -- in the course of enforcing customs or

20

excise laws.

21

going to have a better sense of how the exception might

22

work.

23

enforcement officer engaged in customs excise?

24
25

If we can understand that, then we are

Can you give me an example of the other law

MR. ANDRE:

Sure.

The best example that

comes to mind is pre-9/11 before the merger of the INS
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and the Border Patrol -- or I'm sorry, the Customs

2

Bureau -- under the Department of Homeland Security.

3

When you drove across the border before 9/11 more often

4

than not you would see a gentleman or a woman in a green

5

jump suit.

6

asking you questions about your immigration status and

7

checking to see if you had ID; they were also asking

8

about what you were bringing in -- for example, oh, do

9

you have more than two bottles of liquor?

They were INS.

But not only were they

Because

10

you're only allowed to bring in two.

11

yes, they would direct you over to secondary inspection,

12

and even there in secondary inspection certainly

13

sometimes there may have been officers in blue suits,

14

the customs enforcement officers.

15

not, they were still officers in green suits, INS

16

officers.

17

from you because they believe you are not supposed to

18

have it, and then sending you on your way.

19

And if you said

But more often than

And there they're taking this extra property

There are many task forces in many other

20

instances in which officers can overlap or share

21

functions, postal inspectors working with the customs

22

enforcement agencies to keep -

23
24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
because they would be covered?
MR. ANDRE:

Right.

Did you say IRS officers,
It's tax and customs.
We believe IRS officers

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are expressly covered, but, for example, when the FBI is

2

conducting an investigation with the IRS into fraud and

3

other tax issues, then we believe that those FBI agents

4

would be covered.

5

So we don't believe it's hard at all to find

6

a number of examples of where other law enforcement

7

officers are assisting tax and customs officers,

8

standing in the shoes of tax and customs officers, or

9

just doing something sufficiently akin to what tax and

10

customs officers do.

11

And -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You gave an example in

12

your brief that didn't seem to fit.

13

a DEA agent who was searching for narcotics, and that

14

sounds to me like what DEA agents do.

15

auxiliary to a customs officer.

16

MR. ANDRE:

I mean you spoke of

They were not

That's correct, Justice

17

Ginsburg.

18

Circuit.

19

because the DEA agents were opening up a shipping

20

container that had not yet been opened since it came

21

from overseas.

22

That's the Formula One case out of the Second
And the reason why we relied on that case is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they were doing it

23

for their primary business, which was to detect

24

narcotics.

25

MR. ANDRE:

That's right.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

And we again

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reference that case because we wanted to offer the Court

2

a broad construction or make sure the Court was

3

comfortable in knowing that we were comfortable with the

4

"other law enforcement officer" phrase being read

5

broadly to reach any -- you know, any loose tax or

6

customs function.

7

If the Court wants to construe that phrase

8

more narrowly, we still win this case, and we have no

9

problem if the Court wants to do that.

But we think

10

that, given that the residual phrase of the detention

11

clause starts out with the word "any," the way to give

12

-- to give credence to Congress's use of that word is to

13

then construe the phrase as reaching conduct such as the

14

conduct in the Formula One case.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could we interpret the term

16

"law enforcement" -- "any other law enforcement officer"

17

to be limited to those law enforcement officers whose

18

duties generally include the detention of goods?

19

MR. ANDRE:

Well, I don't think so, Justice

20

Alito, because we weren't really prepared to debate what

21

exactly "detention" means.

22

on that issue, and my client didn't press it below.

23

we were just intuitively thinking -- I don't think the

24

word "detention" does much work for us here, at least in

25

--

In fact, we didn't petition

14
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why doesn't it?

It's

2

not clear to me.

3

but why were your client's goods detained?

4

seems to connote holding the goods against the wishes of

5

the owner, and that wasn't the situation here.

6

those goods -- he gave them to the Bureau of Prisons

7

officer for the purpose of having them sent on to his

8

new prison.

9
10
11

Maybe this is not within the question,

MR. ANDRE:

I agree.

"Detention"

He gave

I should have been

more clear.
We don't believe that the word "detention"

12

necessarily sheds a lot of light on how you construe

13

what "other law enforcement officer" means, but

14

certainly, yeah, we believe that if the detention issue

15

were alive in this case, we have a very strong case,

16

because there's a very passive kind of bailment here, as

17

you referenced, where our -- my client was, you know,

18

told to leave his property with a receiving/discharge

19

clerk and go to a new institution, and the property was

20

going to follow him along.

21

was no investigation.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

There was no seizure.

There

Well, you don't think that

23

concept sheds light on what Congress had in mind when it

24

referred to any other Federal law enforcement officer?

25

MR. ANDRE:

I -- I don't, but I don't want
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to resist you too much either.

2

would like us to reach that issue, we'd be happy to

3

brief if the Court wanted to issue an order akin to the

4

one it issued last term in U.S. v. Resendiz-Ponce.

5

You know, if the Court

And I think to get more directly to what

6

you're saying, whatever Congress intended as far as

7

other law enforcement officers, the fact that we have a

8

case here where, again, there is this very passive

9

bailment by a Bureau of Prisons receiving/discharge

10

clerk, I think exemplifies how the government's

11

construction of the statute is too broad.

12

that might be what you were trying to tease out of me

13

there.

14

And I think

And to get back to the government's

15

construction, we believe that their construction would

16

render a number of words in this statute superfluous,

17

which is sort of our third textual reason for reading

18

the statute our way.

19

20

Fourteen words would be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But, I mean that's

24

always true when you have an example and a more general

25

phrase.

And yet our cases indicate that we often read
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the language that way.

2

In other words, it's giving you, perhaps,

3

the most common example in which you're going to have a

4

detention of goods, but it's not limiting it to those

5

officers.

6

MR. ANDRE:

Well, there certainly are some

7

cases that would appear to go both ways, although I

8

think if you take a look at the cases cited by the

9

government, those cases involve pretty -- I realize we

10

have an unclear, bizarre statute here as well, but those

11

are pretty bizarre statutes the government is relying on

12

where the Court has, and more often than not, it has

13

also been as an alternative statement, you could even

14

say possibly dicta, where the Court has said, oh,

15

Congress can give examples.

16

But more often than not, the Court applies

17

the ejustem generis canon and the noscitur a sociis

18

canon to confine or limit a superficially broad residual

19

phrase.

20

Ada would have come out the other way, Dolan v. Postal

21

Service, of course, Circuit City.

22
23

And if that weren't the case, then Gutierrez v.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but S.D. Marine

wouldn't have come out the other way.

24

MR. ANDRE:

That's true.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Was that an obscure

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute in S.D. Marine?

2
3

MR. ANDRE:

I'm sorry.

I'm not that

familiar with the statute that we have in that case.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Doesn't the word, as

5

your brother argues, doesn't "any" cut against you?

6

they intended the other law enforcement officer to be

7

limited to similar to customs or excise, it seems to me

8

they wouldn't have thrown in "any other law enforcement

9

officer."

10

MR. ANDRE:

If

Well, as kind of a practical

11

matter, we don't think that when you have a statute like

12

this, the word "any" really does a lot of work.

13

if you had taken out the word "any" and instead

14

pluralized the word "officer," I don't think the statute

15

really would work any differently.

16

I mean

But even taking -- taking as true this

17

Court's oft-repeated statement that "any" is evidence of

18

expansive meaning by Congress, we believe our

19

construction is faithful to that, because we are willing

20

to bring in to our construction of the statute some of

21

these other law enforcement officers who may be

22

performing their ordinary functions, such as DEA

23

officers, enforcement of drug laws, but they are doing

24

it akin to customs laws.

25

And again, the Court need not adopt that
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

construction for us to prevail in this case.

2

how we believe that our construction is faithful to the

3

word "any" to the extent that in this statute it's

4

relevant at all.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that's

Justice Alito's question, has there ever been a debate

Well, my client was pro se in

16

the Court of Appeals, and he didn't raise it there.

17

to be -- again, we didn't think that the issue of

18

whether a detention had to be a seizure, something more

19

forceful, or whether it was so broad as to include more

20

of a passive bailment like we have here, we didn't

21

believe that that issue had percolated enough in the

22

courts of appeals to warrant petitioning on.

23

figured we'd fight this fight here today.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

So we

But it is clear -- there

are so many exceptions from exceptions from exceptions,
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that you get a little mixed up, but I am clear, am I

2

not, that if it were not a detention, you would win?

3

MR. ANDRE:

Absolutely.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

MR. ANDRE:

Everybody agrees.

If there was not a detention or

6

if the BOP guard was not an any other law enforcement,

7

we would win under either two of those independent

8

analyses.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And is it also not clear

10

that under the government's -- I guess I should ask

11

them, but I got it right in front of me now -- if you

12

deleted the words "officer of customs or exercise or any

13

other," if you just took those words out of the statute,

14

it would then mean exactly what the government contends

15

it means?

16

MR. ANDRE:

That's exactly right.

And

17

that's why we believe that the rule against superfluity

18

is another reason why our construction is more faithful

19

to Congress's intent in this case.

20

As I mentioned at the outset, we also

21

believe that the legislative history underlying purposes

22

for this particular provision support our reading.

23

particular, I realize the legislative history is pretty

24

sparse, but in particular, there were six congressional

25

committee reports issued by Congress after the detention
20
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

clause was expanded to essentially its current form.

2

And in all six of those reports, Congress

3

conspicuously omitted to make any reference to the fact

4

that this phrase could possibly reach the detentions of

5

all property by all law enforcement officers.

6

Now, we're not suggesting that this case is

7

at all like Arlington v. Murphy, for example, where we

8

are going to have legislative history try to overrule a

9

clear statutory text.

I think it's pretty clear that

10

this text is ambiguous, and so legislative history is

11

relevant to give that text meaning.

12

And so the reason why we focus here on those

13

particular committee reports is, as the Court of Appeals

14

has stated, the committee reports are the most helpful

15

form of legislative history because when many members of

16

Congress go up to vote, they haven't parsed particular

17

provisions in the text; they rely on the committee

18

reports, the reports prepared by the committee that

19

marked up and presented the language to the floor.

20

so, if when all those members -

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the President

22

doesn't rely on those when he signs the statute into

23

law.

24
25

MR. ANDRE:

No.

And

That's true, Your Honor.

But when those members typically go up to the floor and
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

vote, they oftentimes don't parse the language.

2

rely on the committee reports.

3

They

And so if the government's construction were

4

correct here, essentially what you would have is all of

5

those members' votes being overridden because they

6

couldn't possibly have known -- unless they took the

7

time to parse the text and we all know that a lot of

8

times they don't -- they wouldn't possibly know that

9

there'd be any chance whatsoever that this phrase could

10

broadly reach the detention of property by all law

11

enforcement officers.

12

legislative history argument aside, I think we're -- our

13

strongest footing, when we talk about how our

14

construction is faithful to Congress's underlying

15

purpose for this particular provision, on three

16

occasions, this Court has either suggested or expressly

17

stated that the purpose for this particular provision

18

was to avoid the creation of a redundant federally

19

funded remedy.

20

there was a pre-existing federally funded remedy only

21

for the negligent conduct of tax and customs officers.

22
23
24
25

Even putting that kind of

As we explain in our opening brief,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does that still exist

after the Westfall Act?
MR. ANDRE:

Well, we believe it would if -

well, actually that's a very good question.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

I'm not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sure.

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

wouldn't be -- the United States would be substituted -

4

MR. ANDRE:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6
7

Because now, the -- there

Right.
-- for the agent's

abuses.
MR. ANDRE:

Right, but then in that

8

situation, once the United States substituted, they

9

could seek dismissal because the Westfall Act doesn't

10

override any exceptions to the FTCA.

11

Ginsburg, in that particular case, if you're dealing

12

with an officer of customs or tax or another law

13

enforcement acting in that capacity, and they were sued

14

personally for the negligent handling of property, the

15

government could certify they're acting within the scope

16

of their employment, step into the case, and then move

17

to dismiss under this provision, under 2680(c).

18

So, yes, Justice

But, historically, there was -- before the

19

Westfall Act, there was a pre-existing federally funded

20

remedy for only officers acting in a tax or customs

21

capacity or customs or tax officers by name.

22

would be inconsistent with Congress's underlying purpose

23

to avoid creating a duplicative remedy to apply its

24

provisions so broadly because Congress wanted to provide

25

a cause of action for claims against law enforcement
23
Alderson Reporting Company

And so it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

officers other than those against whom a cause of action

2

was already available.

3
4

JUSTICE ALITO:

How do we know -- how do we

know that that's the only purpose of this exception?

5

MR. ANDRE:

Well, as I mentioned, this Court

6

suggested in Kosak that that was the only only purpose,

7

but then in Hatzlachh and in Gutierrez v. Martinez, this

8

Court twice stated that that was the only purpose, and

9

the Court did so for good reason.

Again, although the

10

legislative history is sparse, the only statements

11

whatsoever in the legislative record about the purpose

12

for this particular provision was that Congress was

13

intending to avoid creating a duplicative remedy.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

This is all based on Judge

15

Holtzoff's testimony?

16

conclusion that this is the only purpose for this

17

exception?

18

That's the basis for the

MR. ANDRE:

And it's also based on the

19

testimony of Colonel O.R. McGuire, who is general

20

counsel for the Comptroller General.

21

Judge -- well, Judge Holtzoff was probably the architect

22

of the detention clause and maybe this entire provision.

23

It was the Comptroller General's Office, and Judge

24

Holtzoff who jointly were responsible for preparing tort

25

claims legislation.

And it wasn't just

So, essentially, of the two people
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

who were most relevant to the preparation of the FTCA,

2

and granted we're talking 15 years before its actual

3

enactment, but two people who were most important for

4

preparing this tort claims legislation, they both agreed

5

that the only purpose for this particular provision was

6

to avoid creating a redundant remedy.

7
8

I'd like to save the rest of my time for
rebuttal.

Mr. Andre.

Thank you,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON SHANMUGAM

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

14

Justice, and may it please the Court:

15

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Section 2680(c) preserves the government's

16

immunity against tort claims concerning the detention of

17

property by any law enforcement officer.

18

is consistent not only with the plain language of the

19

statute but also with Congress's underlying policy

20

objectives in creating the FTCA's exception.

21

Petitioner effectively asks this Court to engraft

22

language on to the statute by adding the amorphous

23

limitation "acting in a customs or tax capacity" to the

24

unambiguous statutory phrase "any other law enforcement

25

officer."
25
Alderson Reporting Company

That reading

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Shanmugam, may I ask

2

you -- this goes to your ambiguity point.

3

this question?

4

officers, the only reason for mentioning the customs and

5

excise people would be to make it very clear that they

6

were within that category of all law enforcement

7

officers, and I take it that's basically what you're

8

saying.

9

May I ask you

If Congress wanted to cover all law

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, I think that's correct

10

with one caveat, Justice Souter, and I don't mean to

11

quibble, but I think that this is important.

12

when one looks at the evolution of the statute, it may

13

very well have that when Judge Holtzoff drafted the

14

relevant statutory language, he started with customs or

15

excise officers because the British bill that was

16

apparently the model for the detention of property

17

clause -

I think

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

19

MR. SHANMUGAM: -- used that phrase, and he

20

may then have decided to expand it to other law

21

enforcement officers simply because he concluded that

22

there was no basis for treating other law enforcement

23

officers differently.

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But wouldn't So -

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But wouldn't the way to do

2

that would have made it at least clearer that that's

3

what Congress or what he had in mind and what Congress

4

was getting at would have been to provide that the -

5

that the exception referred to law enforcement officers

6

including an officer or customs of excise?

7

words, they would have made it clear that at that point,

8

the old historical customs and excise rule was sort of

9

the tail on the dog, and the dog was law enforcement

In other

10

officers.

Instead, however, the order is exactly

11

different.

On what your reading is -- on your reading,

12

what is now the tail of the dog comes first, and the

13

general clause "law enforcement officer" comes second.

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, number one, it is less

16

clear and it really raises the question:

17

trying to get simply at law enforcement officers who

18

were doing the customs and excise function?

19

question is, why doesn't the order of the words cut

20

against you by putting, on your theory, the tail of the

21

dog before the dog?

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Weren't they

So my

Justice Souter, it is

23

certainly true that Congress could have written that

24

statute that way and indeed could have omitted the

25

customs or excise officers entirely, and that certainly
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be a clearer statute in the sense that I don't

2

think that Mr. Andre would be here if we had a statute

3

that simply referred to any law enforcement officer.

4

But the United States Code is replete with

5

provisions that fit this model, that start with specific

6

examples and then contain a general residual clause.

7

And, indeed, even the Constitution has similar

8

provisions.

9

among the many examples in footnote 11 of our brief, the

To take one concrete example that we cite

10

Extradition Clause in Article IV of the Constitution

11

refers to extradition for treason, felonies, and other

12

crimes, and there is no doubt that the framers could

13

have simply referred to crimes, but they cited those

14

examples.

15

Kentucky v. Denyson, the reason that Congress used those

16

examples was for emphasis to make clear that political

17

crimes such as treason and other felonies that would

18

qualify as political crimes were covered.

As this Court held in a case way back when,

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's also So It's also not entirely

22

clear what -- whether it's a tail or not.

It depends on

23

what the dog is.

24

identify the most common instances, especially at the

25

time this provision was enacted, the most common

If you can -- if you were trying to

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

instances in which property was detained by the

2

government, I mean you know, later -- later forfeiture

3

provisions are numerous, but at that time I think they

4

were relatively few.

5

would have been customs and excise officers.

6

"or other officers" would have picked up probably very

7

little real -- real instances of property detention.

8
9

I think the dog would have been -

MR.SHANMUGAM:

And the

Assuming for present

purposes, Justice Scalia, that the dog here is any

10

officer of customs or excise, I think that the critical

11

point is that the tail was indeed smaller than it would

12

be today because customs and excise officers were among

13

the most important federal law enforcement officers.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If you You know No, but -- but a short

17

time ago you said there was no basis for distinguishing

18

between excise officers and all other law enforcement

19

officers.

20

that there was an alternative remedy for people

21

specifically named in the statute, which is not true of

22

all other officers.

23

But there was indeed a basis for it, namely

It's true now, but it wasn't then.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we believe, first of

24

all, that if one looks at this Court's decision in

25

Kosak, the Court did not in any way suggest that the
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

availability of alternative remedies was the sole

2

purpose -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm not suggesting that,

4

but that is a reason for drawing a distinction between

5

all others and this particular claim.

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Stevens, it

7

certainly was one of Congress's primary purposes in

8

creating the exceptions generally, but we do believe

9

that our interpretation of the statute serves that

10

purpose, albeit to a lesser extent perhaps than it

11

serves the other congressional purposes, but that was -

12
13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It didn't serve that

purpose before 2000.

14

MR.SHANMUGAM:

It did serve that purpose,

15

Justice Stevens, because there was an alternative

16

remedy, albeit one that was not federally funded and

17

that was a common-law action against a law enforcement

18

officer in his personal capacity for negligence.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

funded?

21

indemnification.

22

Why wasn't it federally

I thought there was a provision for

MR.SHANMUGAM:

There was a provision for

23

indemnification for revenue officers and other officers

24

essentially acting in a revenue capacity, I believe that

25

the exact statutory language was "collectors and other
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

revenue officers" -- and that indemnification provision,

2

to be sure, would not have applied to garden variety law

3

enforcement officers.

4

But in looking at the availability of

5

alternative remedies, this Court has never suggested

6

that whether that congressional purpose is served

7

somehow turns on whether the money came directly from an

8

officer or whether it came from the Federal fisc.

9

Petitioner in his reply brief cites Dolan for that

10

proposition but whether the alternative remedy was

11

federally funded was simply not at issue in Dolan.

12

most the Court concluded that the alternative remedy

13

available there was insufficient.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

At

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It's very difficult to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

quantify, Justice Breyer, but I do think we have some

2

sense historically of the state of play at various law

3

enforcement agencies; and the FBI was in a relatively

4

nascent stage in 1946.

5

approximately the turn of the 20th century.

the Bureau of Prisons, while it existed, was detaining

far fewer people than it does now.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I can't offer you a

23

ballpark, but I think what I can say, and this accords

24

with observations that various members of this Court

25

have made over the years, is that there were simply far
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fewer Federal criminal provisions then than there are

2

now, and I think that that is one of the reasons why

3

we've really seen an explosion in the number of these

4

cases as time has gone on, while the FTCA -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, well that might be.

6

But I'm sitting in Congress, I read this statute, I

7

think maybe they were talking about customs people and

8

the like.

9

that's true.

Now, there is this other word in there,
So we look up, where does the other word

10

come from?

11

He explained it, we don't have to guess.

12

his explanation.

13

having to do with customs and excise, and beginning

14

with, I'm talking about customs and excise, and the

15

additional proviso as special reference, where they use

16

this phrase, and then he says it's all supposed to be

17

like the Crown Proceedings Committee in England in 1927,

18

which in fact had nothing to do with anybody but customs

19

and excise.

20

The other word comes from Judge Holtzoff.
We can read

His explanation comes in a paragraph

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do the members of Congress

21

who voted on this language, when it was presented to

22

them, did they even know who Judge Holtzoff was?

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Well, they may very well Did he testify to this

effect before one of the committees?
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

2

the committees.

3

but as this Court -

4
5

He did testify before one of

He did not address this specific issue,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15 years before it was

passed, right?

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

15 years before it was

7

passed, Judge Holtzoff wrote this report, and as both

8

the majority and Justice Stevens in his dissenting

9

opinion in Kosak observed, there was no evidence that

10

this report was even introduced into the legislative

11

record.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so if it was not -- I

13

mean, I would suspect at that time Judge Holtzoff was a

14

pretty well known person in the legal community and I

15

would suspected if we are guessing at such a thing that

16

quite a few did know who he was.

17

when Congress passes a technical bill, they are

18

interested in the views of the Department of Justice and

19

these were those views.

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I suspect that

I want to -

So if we are going to play

22

a magic game that we don't pay attention to what sheds

23

light on it, fine, then we don't, but I would.

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, Justice Breyer, I

wanted simply to make the point that in the pantheon of
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

legislative history sources for those members of the

2

Court who are interested in legislative history, we

3

recognized that the Holtzoff report should not be

4

afforded great weight.

5

want to address directly the language you cite from the

6

Holtzoff report, because I believe that that language if

7

anything supports our position, and not Petitioners,

8

because in the relevant sentence of the Holtzoff report,

9

Judge Holtzoff wrote that the additional proviso,

But that having been said, I

10

meaning the detention of property clause, has special

11

reference to the detention of imported goods in

12

appraisers' warehouses or customs houses as well as

13

seizures by law enforcement officials, Internal Revenue

14

officers and the like.

15

Now Petitioner -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there any

16

legislative history about what Judge Holtzoff meant by

17

that?

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, one could make the

19

argument that that legislative history is itself

20

ambiguous; and indeed the D.C. Circuit in adopting

21

Petitioner's construction itself acknowledged that at

22

best, the legislative history was as unclear as the

23

statute.

24
25

All I mean to suggest is that Petitioner
does not have available to him any sort of ejusdem
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

generis argument in construing that sentence.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I think in reading

3

that, I think that's a good point.

4

it, of that paragraph 2, is that it's not free of

5

ambiguity.

6

through it, then I'm making up my mind as a judge, well,

7

how do I feel about what these words likely show and how

8

people in Congress would have interpreted that kind of

9

reference or statement in testimony by a person who

I completely agree with you.

10

thought this?

11

isn't.

12

Petitioners than the Respondents.

13

My actual reading of

But it might cut somewhat more in favor of the

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think, Justice

14

Breyer, with all respect, that this is not a case in

15

which very much of a conclusion can be drawn from the

16

legislative history one way or another.

17

language from the Holtzoff report which I admit, you

18

know, could be susceptible to the same sorts of

19

arguments that Petitioner is making with regard to what

20

we feel is the unambiguous language of the statute.

21

other than that the only thing that my friend has Mr.

22

Andre has cited are these summaries in various

23

congressional reports which essentially summarize in

24

shorthand, often in a single sentence, all of the

25

proposed exceptions in the FTCA; and none of those
36
Alderson Reporting Company

We have this

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

summaries so much as refers to the "and any other law

2

enforcement officer" language at all.

3

the summaries on which Petitioner relies do not even

cite the detention of property exception at all.

In fact, some of

So this is, in our view, a case in which at

6

most, the legislative history is simply silent.

7

are left, I think, and indeed we should start with the

8

text of the statute, and we have the unambiguous phrase

9

"or any other law enforcement officer" in this case.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we

You have a difference

11

with Mr. Andre on the extent to which other law

12

enforcement officers assist customs and revenue agents.

it?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And

So which is

Well, we do believe that it

17

is a rare occurrence, but in some sense, Justice

18

Ginsburg, I think that the answer to that question

19

depends on exactly what it is that Petitioner means when

20

he says that an officer is acting in a customs or tax

21

capacity.

22

at least three possible explanations for what that means

23

and then explain why each of them would be an erroneous

24

interpretation for this Court to adopt, and each of

25

these three explanations I should add, appear at various

And with the Court's leave, I'd like to offer

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

points in Petitioner's brief.

2

The first is that an officer is acting in a

3

customs or tax capacity when the officer is actually

4

acting in a revenue collecting capacity.

5

that if the Court were to adopt that limitation, there

6

really are no actual cases of which we are aware that

7

would fall within that language.

8

cast some doubt on the meaning of the preceding phrase

9

"any officer of customs or excise" because one might

And we believe

And indeed, it would

10

very well wonder whether under Petitioner's construction

11

that phrase should also be limited to a revenue

12

collecting capacity.

13

The second possible explanation is that an

14

officer is acting in a customs or tax capacity when the

15

officer is more generally acting to enforce the customs

16

or tax laws, that is to say, the provisions of Title 19

17

or 26 of the United States Code.

18

that interpretation, too, would suffer from the same two

19

deficiencies that I've already identified and would also

20

suffer from a third, namely, to the extent that

21

Petitioner relies for his noscitur a sociis argument on

22

the assessment of taxes clause, that limitation would

23

actually sweep more broadly than the mere assessment of

24

taxes.

25

But we believe that

So the third possible interpretation and the
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

one that we're left with, I think, is that an officer is

2

acting in a customs or tax capacity whenever the officer

3

is actually performing a function that is performed by

4

customs or excise Internal Revenue officers.

5

anything, that limitation would exclude only a very

6

small number of cases apart from cases in the prison

7

context such as this one, because as Petitioner himself

8

recognizes, customs officers have virtually plenary

9

authority to enforce the criminal provisions of the

United States Code.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Are all customs and excise

officers law enforcement officers?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

All customs officers, by

14

statute, have law- enforcement authority, and that is

15

under, I believe, 19 U.S.C. 1589(a).

16

Now, to be sure, there are people employed

17

by the Customs Service, now ICE and CBP components of

18

the Department of Homeland Security, who wouldn't

19

qualify as customs officers.

20
21
22

There are secretaries and other people
employed there that don't that statutory definition.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Are there other

23

circumstances in which, let's say, goods are being

24

shipped into the country, and the -- the shipment is

25

detained by someone who is not a law-enforcement

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

officer, at least under the definition in subsection

2

(h), someone who has the power to execute searches,

3

seize evidence, and make arrests?

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think they typically would

5

be, and I'm not aware of any examples in which they

6

would not be, because customs officers are the vast

7

majority of people who are employed by the various

8

customs-related agencies.

9

And the same is true, I would note, with

10

regard to Internal Revenue officers.

11

oddities of this statute is that Judge Holtzoff, rather

12

than using the known term "Internal Revenue Officer,"

13

actually used this phrase "officer of excise," seemingly

14

borrowing from the British bill.

15

One of the

And we believe that, at most, that phrase

16

would have to refer to an Internal Revenue officer

17

acting in an excise- collecting capacity.

18

extent that "excise officer" has a narrower meaning than

19

"Internal Revenue officer," we believe that that

20

actually supports our construction, because it would

21

have been quite peculiar for Judge Holtzoff and Congress

22

to have referred only to an excise officer and not to an

23

Internal Revenue officer if they had meant to limit the

24

residual phrase "any other law-enforcement officer" to

25

officers acting in a customs or tax capacity.

The FTCA was, of course, ultimately enacted

in 1946, and I think that one of the difficulties in

attempting to look to this legislative history, which,

about, you know, a number of Congresses over many years.

these same legislative history sources in prior

decisions construing the FTCA.

think that we are left with the plain language here.

objectives, and I do want to say a word about the other

two policy objectives on which this court relied in

possible fourth category, really.

three, and one -- a fourth possibility might be

"law-enforcement officer," in a very broad sense of the

term, but one who is simply providing, let's say,

protective service in aid ultimately of the revenue

You had mentioned

42
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And the reason I have thought of this is

2

that this sort of situation went on in my -- my native

3

State in this past month, in which the United States

4

Marshal Service, which at the time all of these statutes

5

were enacted was a fairly large agency, took control of

6

some real estate in -- in New Hampshire which had been

the property, or was the property, of tax protesters.

took control of that real estate for about a week to

make sure that there were no booby traps and bombs that

12

they went in there to enforce their tax liens.

law-enforcement functions, protective functions.

It could cover the

think that it is telling that in the 60-year history of

into that category.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But our fundamental

7

submission, Justice Souter, is that there is no good

8

textual reason for confining the phrase "any other

view, is unambiguous.

11

And, notably, Petitioner in his brief and at

any ambiguity in that phrase, itself.

has noted, in applying both the noscitur a sociis and

statute and it happens to follow these specific
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

references to tax gatherers and tax and excise laws,

2

then it seems to me it's fair to say it does become

3

ambiguous, because it gives rise to a reasonable

4

question.

5

Were they just getting at law-enforcement

6

officers who were performing these kinds of functions,

7

or did they really mean it as broadly as the phrase in

real isolation would have meant?

9

that's what we've got here.

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's ambiguity, and

I don't believe that that's

11

correct, Justice Souter, and the reason that I don't

12

believe that that is correct is because this Court has

13

suggested that the starting point is the relevant phrase

that is being interpreted.

He does have an

And I'd like to say just a couple of things
about the available administrative remedies.

9

First of all, any claimant who claims that a

10

Federal agency, including a Federal law enforcement

11

agency negligently damaged his or her property, would

12

have a claim under 31 U.S.C. 3723 for up to $1,000.

13

That statute, which we cite in a footnote, I believe in

14

our brief, would cover the vast majority of claims

15

involving the Bureau of Prisons.

16

There's actually another Federal statute, 31

17

U.S.C. 3724, which provides a further remedy against the

18

Department of Justice for up to $50,000 for personal

19

injury or property damage caused by a law enforcement

20

officer.

21

clear that it applies where the FTCA does not.

22

that administrative remedy would be fully available.

23

And critically, that statute expressly makes

underlying policy considerations, because to the extent

that members of the Court feel that the statute is

construction.

18

In Kosak, this Court analyzed two other

policy considerations in addition to the avoidance of

duplicative remedies:

21

government functions from the threat of suit; and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE

5
6

Thank you,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ANDRE:

I'd like to first address the

7

government's resistance to making any concession that

8

the statute is ambiguous.

9

statutory language in this case was so clear, then so

First of all, if the

10

must the statutory language in Circuit City.

The

11

language had started out with the words "any other," and

12

clearly then were followed by words that have a very

13

plain meaning out of context, "any worker engaged in

14

interstate or foreign commerce."

15

We just don't believe that the government's

16

position that the statute is unambiguous can be squared

17

with that case.

18

that the statute is unambiguous.

19

Nor do we think as a factual matter

In particular, we think it would have been

20

strange for this Court in Kosak to go out of its way in

21

a footnote and expressly decline to resolve today's

22

question presented if the detention of property clause,

23

in particular the "law enforcement officer" phrase, had

24

only one clear meaning.

25

And then on top of that, as we noted in our

Alderson Reporting Company

reply brief, five courts of appeals have adopted our

2

construction; two other circuit judges have written

be ambiguous, applied the canons of construction that we

the case in our favor

10
11

The total is 16 circuit judges that have

So if, if the statute is truly unambiguous,
then those 16 circuit judges not only got this issue
wrong, they got it very wrong.
Justice Breyer, I unfortunately don't have an

12

example either of what other types of law enforcement

13

officers were out there at the time of the FTCA's

14

enactment, but I do have one example, and that would be

15

the Elliott Ness and the Al Capone investigation.

16

Elliott Ness was in charge of running a group

17

of -- in charge of supervising a group of government

18

agents who were part of the Department of Justice, even

19

though Elliott Ness himself was a treasury agent.

20

they were all trying enforce the Volstead Act, but -- to

21

get Al Capone on charges of income tax evasion.

22

we believe that that's a nice example from the early

shows that you could have a revenue officer working
