ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

The Court will hear

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Justice Stevens,

and may it please the Court:

11

Six years ago, this Court in Buckman

12

recognized that policing fraud against Federal agencies

13

is hardly a field the states have traditionally

14

occupied.

15

struck down a novel State tort that was based on the

16

whole concept of fraud on the FDA.

17

Based on that premise, this Court in Buckman

And the Court concluded that that tortious

18

analysis as a matter of State law would inevitably

19

conflict with the FDA's responsibility to police fraud.

20

A responsibility that the Court recognized was

21

essentially cradle to grave covered by Federal law.

22

arises out of Federal law, it is regulated by Federal

23

law and it is ultimately terminated by Federal law.

24
25

Michigan has adopted a unique product
liability statute, and on the one hand confers a very
3

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

broad immunity of defense against all product liability

2

claims for manufacturers who comply with the FDA's

3

requirements.

4

But then on the other hand, withdraws that

5

immunity for the defense, this is PDA App. 42A, if the

6

manufacturer intentionally withholds from or

7

misrepresents to the United States Food and Drug

8

Administration information concerning the drug that is

9

required to be submitted pursuant to -- and then it goes

10

and lists very specific provisions of the Food, Drug,

11

and Cosmetic Act -- and the drug would not have been

12

approved or the Food and Drug Administration would have

13

withdrawn approval.

14

It is difficult for me to imagine a statute

15

that would more consciously and openly tread into

16

exactly the same territory that this Court declared in

17

Buckman as a matter of exclusive Federal and concern not

18

available to the states to regulate.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Phillips, what if the

20

statute didn't have that provision, but it just said you

21

can bring a State tort action when the conditions

22

approved by the FDA for the marketing of this drug have

23

not been complied with?

24

you knowledge that that -- that that suit could be

25

brought?

That's all it says.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, would

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

I will acknowledge that's a

2

fundamentally different issue, Justice Scalia, because

3

there you are talking about what duties are owed to the

4

public that are enforced by the FDA and potentially are

5

enforceable by the states as well.

6
7

But here we're talking about duties that are
owed from the manufacturer exclusively -

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
by the FDA.

It's a duty that is defined

And I didn't hear your answer.

10

suit be allowable or not?

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Would that

That suit would not be

12

barred, I don't think, by Buckman.

13

there will really go to what the Court is going to

14

decide next term in Wyeth as to how far when if you have

15

FDA approval of certain activities that that has the

16

effect of -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think the question

It doesn't seem to me -

18

what I worry about is that if we say in this case it

19

treads too much into the FDA's own responsibility to say

20

what material should have been provided to the FDA, it

21

seems to me the next what could be more central to the

22

FDA -- to the FDA's job than determining whether the

23

conditions the FDA prescribed for the marketing of the

24

drug have indeed been observed?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's central as well.

I don't think it is an
5


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unreasonable next step, but it is clearly the next step

2

that has to be taken.

3

in Buckman -- and it's central and candidly we are here

4

seeking a very narrow ruling from the Court is that when

5

you're defining the relationship between the

6

manufacturer and the seller of the drugs and the FDA in

7

terms of the disclosure of information to that entity

8

and the determination both whether that information is

9

adequate to allow the agency to perform its business and

Because what this Court decided

10

then, more fundamentally, whether or not the agency is

11

acting in accordance with its own exclusive authority to

12

decide how to proceed -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But one can also reason in

14

the opposite direction; that is to say, one can know

15

from the medical devices portion of the FDA that

16

Congress has no objection to private tort actions

17

that -- where the medical device manufacturer has not

18

observed the requirements that the FDA's approval

19

impose, right?

20

has no objection to that there.

21

We know from that section that Congress

You can probably guess that Congress has no

22

objection to it in the -- in the drug field as well as

23

the medical devices field.

24

what is so different about having a jury second-guess

25

the provision of information portion?

And if I make that guess,

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

It seems to me that the same

2

argument you just made, Justice Scalia, would have led

3

the Court to the opposite result in Buckman, because

4

what's the -- you know, if Congress didn't care about

5

allowing State tort law to be -- to serve as the

6

enforcement mechanism, then why wouldn't you allow them

7

to do that in that context as well?

8
9

And this Court said the reason is because
there is a very uniquely Federal interest in taking care

10

of the business and the relationship between those two

11

entities.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, It is -- it is more

13

of a stick in the eye of the Federal Government to

14

create a cause of action that consists of defrauding the

15

Federal Government, which is what was at issue in

16

Buckman.

17

information to the FDA.

18

standard tort cause of action for marketing a defective

19

product.

20

The very cause of action was providing false

MR. PHILLIPS:

Here the cause of action is a

Well, when you say "here"

21

what we're talking -- what we're talking about here is a

22

very unique State statute that is the sole basis on

23

which the tort liability is set aside.

24
25

We're not -- we're not pre-empting the
underlying tort claims by the Federal law that's at
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

issue in this case.

The State statute pre-empts the

2

common law court claims.

That first portion of the

3

defense wipes those out.

So it's not pre-emption of the

4

traditional State law cause of action, as the Second

5

Circuit wrongly evaluated it.

6

here is a provision that in the most exquisite terms

7

says:

8

juries, to evaluate the adequacy of the information that

9

the FDA required.

What we're talking about

Allow the State, either by the court or the

10

And it's important to understand how that

11

plays out, because what it says is pursuant to those

12

statutes.

It specifically identifies provisions in the

13

statutes.

It doesn't say anything about how the FDA -

14

how the FDA interprets those statutes.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Phillips, isn't -

16

isn't the standard -- in the standard tort claim, no

17

Michigan statute, but a defense that's available to a

18

drug manufacturer who is charged with putting on the

19

market a defective drug, its regulatory compliance,

20

right?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

Michigan has said:

24

sellers -

25

Yes.
And so the State of

Drug dealers -- I'm sorry -- drug

(Laughter.)
8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- drug manufacturers, we

2

are going to give you an invigorated defense.

3

of just saying you show regulatory compliance, we're

4

going to take you off the hook altogether, except if you

5

didn't come clean with the FDA, if you withheld

6

information or misrepresented information.

7

Instead

It seems to me that what -- you could say

8

this is just like Buckman, but you could also say this

9

is giving the manufacturer an invigorated regulatory

10
11
12
13

compliance defense.
So why shouldn't it be looked at as the
second, rather than the first?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think what you're

14

basically arguing for is an argument I think one of the

15

amici made on the other side, which is:

Does the

16

greater power include the lesser power?

That is, if we

17

had the authority not to give you a defense in the first

18

place, don't we have the authority to use this as a

19

lever in order to allow us essentially to undertake to

20

regulate in precisely the same way the FDA would?

21
22
23
24
25

And the answer is:

No, because this is not

a situation JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You're arguing an

unconstitutional condition, in effect.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think it is an

1

unconstitutional condition.

2

is it's not a question of us taking the bad with the

3

good.

4

has an independent interest, and it is the Federal

5

Government's independent interest that is being

6

essentially wiped away.

7

But I think the bottom line

The problem here is that the Federal Government

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you're right in your

8

argument, the Michigan statute provided two things:

9

good for the manufacturer, immunity; two, a

One

10

qualification on it.

11

can't be unstuck.

12

the Sixth Circuit case, and not the other is certainly

13

not faithful to the Michigan legislature that put these

14

two things together.

15

It seems to me that those two

So to strike out one, as was done in

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Ginsburg, that's

16

clearly a question of State law.

I mean, that's a

17

severability issue to be sure.

18

it's not fair to condemn the way the Sixth Circuit

19

analyzed this case.

And I -- but I think

20

What the Sixth Circuit said is if it's still

21

available to the State to come in after the FDA has both

22

found that there has been a material deception of one

23

sort or another and that the FDA has decided to withdraw

24

the product as a consequence of that, and that -- and

25

then State law is allowed to come in and enforce product
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

liability claims under those circumstances, that the

2

legislature would have been perfectly satisfied with

3

that arrangement.

4

And, candidly, that is precisely what we

5

have asked for before both the Second Circuit and this

6

Court.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Phillips, May I ask

8

this question that's related to Justice Ginsburg's, but

9

not the same.

You are saying that the defense is not

10

pre-empted; the response to the defense is what is

11

pre-empted here.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Correct.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What if you didn't have a

14

statute at all and you just had a common law lawsuit in

15

which you defended on the ground of compliance with the

16

Federal statute shows, the Federal program, shows a lack

17

of negligence.

18

rebuttal:

19

fraud, the same kind of thing.

20

pre-empted in a common law lawsuit?

21

And then it then came back with the

Yes, but your compliance was tainted by

MR. PHILLIPS:

Would that response be

I think the question goes to

22

how far that response goes.

If you in fact instructed,

23

if the trial judge instructed the jury that if it found,

24

and then just quoted the language of the statute that

25

there's no, then I'd say, yes, that is pre-empted in
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

precisely the same way.

2

And the language the Court used in Buckman

3

was "critical element."

4

authority is a critical element of the case, then, yes,

5

it is pre-empted.

6
7

Whether or not -- whether evidence by itself
would be a critical element is harder to tell.

8
9

If the FDA's regulatory

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me just finish with

one other thought before -

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In one of your arguments

12

and the government's argument, this is very burdensome

13

to the FDA because we have all this litigation.

14

the years we have had this kind of tort litigation, has

15

this issue ever proved to be burdensome to the

16

government in any of these -- these attempts to make out

17

this charge and this defense?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

In all

I mean, the government is

19

probably in a better position to evaluate that than I

20

am.

But, you know -

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because It seems to me

22

that we have three or four States that have these

23

statutes.

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But most States don't have

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

these statutes.

2

serious as everybody -

3

I wonder if the problem is really as

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think what the Court

4

said in Buckman about that probably applies equally

5

here, which is that, rather than look to see whether

6

there is, in fact, going to be an interference, we ought

7

to recognize that this is a territory that is locked off

8

exclusively to the Federal Government's control, and we

9

shouldn't -- and there shouldn't be that external pull,

10

the extraneous pull, that State law provides under these

11

circumstances.

12

And the same logic obviously applied here

13

would say:

14

interference with how the FDA is trying to do its job;

15

we try to prevent that because there's no -- there's no

16

legitimate State interest to be served here.

17

We don't wait until there's a serious

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think there can

18

also be the same argument for pre-empting the section,

19

the subpart (b) of Michigan statute, the bribery

20

exception?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

I think there's a

22

difference between the bribery statute, because again

23

that doesn't go to the direct relationship between the

24

manufacturer or the seller or the regulated entity and

25

the FDA itself.

That goes to the relationship
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

between -- that -- that is governed by a different set

2

of laws.

3

And I think it's traditionally been the case

4

that States are in fact entitled to enforce laws against

5

bribery of Federal officials.

6

-- as I say, what I'm looking for here is an extremely

7

narrow ruling from this Court.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I don't think the same

What about the defense

9

itself, which says that the defense is available if not

10

only the drug was approved for safety and efficacy, but

11

also if the drug and its labeling were in compliance

12

with the FDA's approval at the time the drug left the

13

control of the manufacturer?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it wrong to say that

16

that's -- you know, that that's interfering with the

17

FDA's bailiwick?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21
22

Are you going to let a jury

decide that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I'm not going to let a

jury decide that.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

Well, I think when the -

What the district court found

here, obviously, was that there was compliance, because
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the other side didn't challenge the compliance.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Uh-huh.
And, candidly, I think that

4

is going to happen 99.999 percent of the time, because

5

that's not going to be the issue.

6

But, you know, could it eventually be a

7

problem if a State jury -- if a State court were to

8

decide that there hasn't been compliance?

9

me that's much closer, again, to what you're going to

10

It seems to

take up again next term in Wyeth.

11

I think that is a legitimate issue, but it's

12

a very different one from the question of how do you

13

regulate the relationship between a -- the regulated

14

entity and the FDA in terms of the information flow that

15

goes between those two entities.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

are saying is:

18

there were no pre-emption.

19

It seems to me what you

We're going to win this case even if

MR. PHILLIPS:

Even if there is no

20

pre-emption on -- on the -- well, I hope I win this case

21

regardless.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because they have such a

23

burden of proving that the drug wouldn't, in fact, have

24

been withdrawn and so forth.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, well -- you mean I
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have won this case on the merits of it?

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

Well, I mean, clearly we know

4

that the FDA didn't withdrew this as a consequence of

5

fraud.

6

but the reality is that the more fundamental problem

7

remains, whether or not these kinds of statutes are

8

still out there, are going to create this -- as the

9

Court said -- extraneous pull.

10

So in that sense, I suppose you're right, but -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let's just say you use

11

something like primary jurisdiction said that they

12

actually have to -- to withdraw it.

13

this is what Justice Stevens said in his concurring

14

opinion, which I thought had a lot to be said for it -

15

that if you had a system where the FDA did withdraw it

16

and found fraud, you could ask them, and then nothing

17

wrong with the plaintiff going ahead there.

18
19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Now, if the FDA -

We don't have any problem

with that, Justice Breyer.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

You don't have any problem.
No, we were very That's not If the Court wanted to go

that way, that's fine.

this case, but that wouldn't present any problem for us.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

8

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

9

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. JOSEFFER:

Thank you, Mr. Phillips.

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
The Michigan statute presents the same

13

conflict this Court found in Buckman, because it

14

requires the determination of fraud on the FDA as a

15

necessary predicate for establishing liability.

16

this Court explained in Buckman, the relationship

17

between a Federal agency and the entities it regulates

18

is inherently Federal.

19

And that's -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Does your argument carry to

20

the point of the same argument when regulatory

21

compliance is raised as a defense, or regulatory

22

violation is raised as a ground for liability?

23

And as

MR. JOSEFFER:

It could depend, because in

24

our view what's pre-empted here is a State court

25

determination -- under Buckman, what's pre-empted is a
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State court determination of whether the FDA was

2

defrauded as part of FDA's approval process.

3

example, under any circumstance, if a jury is being

4

instructed to find whether FDA was defrauded as part of

5

the approval process, we'd say there's pre-emption.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, for

Well, whenever you -

7

whenever you raise FDA compliance, there is at least the

8

potential for a response that they -- they defrauded the

9

FDA; they didn't tell them what they should have, and -

10

you know, vice versa, when -- when it's raised on the

11

other side.

12
13
14

So you always have the potential there for
-- for just what concerns you, don't you?
MR. JOSEFFER:

Well -- and what we would say

15

is not pre-empted -- I mean, it's hard to analyze this

16

in the abstract without a record as to what a jury was

17

actually being asked to do.

18

where it was, say, a design defect claim, and the jury

19

was being asked to decide whether this design is

20

defective, and that's what it's looking at, and in

21

connection with that the jury is instructed that two

22

relevant things it can consider are, first, the fact of

23

FDA's approval determination and, second, the

24

circumstances surrounding that approval determination,

25

then that by itself, we would say, is not pre-empted by

But if you had a situation

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Buckman, really for two reasons.

2

pre-emption normally applies to legal theories, such as

3

claims or defenses, not the mere admissibility of

4

evidence; and the second is that FDA's core prerogatives

5

here, as the administrator of its own drug approval

6

process, are to determine whether it has been defrauded

7

and what to do about that.

8

asked to find those things, but instead is just

9

considering evidence in connection with something else,

10

And if the jury is not being

we would say that that is what's not pre-empted.

11
12

One is that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So it's the withdrawal

element, withdrawal of approval that kills it here?

13

MR. JOSEFFER:

That's part of it but not all

14

of it.

15

of its own approval process, needs absolute discretion

16

to determine what must be submitted to it as part of its

17

own approval process, whether it is misled as part of

18

its own approval process; whether as you said it would

19

have made a different determination in the absence of

20

any fraud.

21

I mean, in our view, FDA, as the administrator

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if you get beyond the

22

element of what the FDA would have done if it had known,

23

then it seems to me you get into an issue which is

24

likely to arise by -- whenever, by one side or the

25

other, the question of regulatory approval is -- is
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

offered as a mere matter of evidence.

2

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, if it really is a mere

3

matter of evidence, and that's not what the jury is be

4

asked to find -- and by the way, it's not at all clear

5

that there's -- that there's -- it's settled common law

6

tradition in this type of litigation, because the

7

context here, where a Federal agency does a

8

product-specific approval based in part on a submission

9

of information from a manufacturer, that's not a -

10

that's a question that, first, is of relatively modern

11

vintage and, second, is not terribly common.

12

not really a uniform, deeply rooted common law tradition

13

here.

14

admissibility of evidence, we would agree that that was

15

not pre-empted.

16

So there's

But if all we were talking about was the mere

But if you look at -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but that's what you've

17

got here, except that the mere admissibility of the

18

evidence turns in part on what the -- the FDA would have

19

done.

20

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, no -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But essentially -- I mean

22

you -- the fact is the evidence of the FDA approval is

23

made admissible and conclusive, and whether that in fact

24

may be admitted is subject to the -- what is it -

25

clause (b) that you object to, but it comes down to a
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question of admissibility.

2

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, it's not because the

3

statute expressly requires, as a predicate for

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this sort of

4

general question?

Apart from Buckman itself, which

5

describes a very serious theoretical problem, as I

6

understand it, there must have been a fair amount of

7

litigation over the years where the regulatory

8

compliance defense was raised or challenged or so forth.

9

Is there -- are there any reported cases describing the

10

magnitude of the problem to the government, when the -

11

as the result of debate about these issues?

12
13

MR. JOSEFFER:
beyond the -

14
15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. JOSEFFER:

20

Well, it's also a relatively

new problem, and what -- because -- because it's -

18
19

The whole theoretical

problem.

16
17

Nothing that -- that that's

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The litigation is not, not

new.
MR. JOSEFFER:

Right, but the

21

product-specific approvals, and the desire to probe into

22

the circumstances surrounding a product-specific

23

approval, is of relatively modern vintage.

24

itself stands for the proposition that that was not a

25

traditional State inquiry at that time.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

And Buckman

And Buckman

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certainly has not encouraged a significant increase in

2

such litigation since then.

3

there's not been a whole lot of.

4

So this is something that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Leaving aside Buckman,

5

what's your strongest case in support of your position?

6

Besides that it is a new problem.

7

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, it is.

It's a novel

8

type of situation where you're -- where you're talking

9

about the Federal Government's prerogatives to

10

administer its own approval processes.

11

been a lot of State court litigation on this, in part

12

because it's so obviously a Federal matter.

13

a State supreme court wanted to tell litigants, private

14

litigants before this Court what they could and couldn't

15

say in their briefs to this Court, the conflict would be

16

obvious and therefore the State supreme court would

17

never do it.

18

the State is essentially telling companies what they

19

must or must not be telling FDA, and there's just an

20

obvious intrusion there with FDA's ability to administer

21

its own approval process.

22

There hasn't

I mean, if

And you have a similar problem here where

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Joseffer, let's

23

assume that -- that you're right.

The Second Circuit,

24

because it thought your position it was wrong, never got

25

to the severance question.

It had been decided by some
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

intermediate appellate court.

2

appropriate then to leave it to the Second Circuit on

3

remand, if it chooses to use the Michigan certification

4

process to say, well, we want to find out from the

5

Michigan Supreme Court whether they think that the sweet

6

stays, but the bitter goes?

7

MR. JOSEFFER:

But would it not be

Right.

And, I mean, as you

8

know, we don't have a position on the State law

9

severability question, because our concern here is

10

protecting FDA's prerogative to administer its own

11

process, not with whether the plaintiff or defendant

12

ultimately wins.

13
14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was decided by the Sixth

Circuit, wasn't it?
MR. JOSEFFER:

It was.

And one of the

16

things that that brings up, in the Sixth Circuit it was

17

actually the plaintiff who was advocating Federal

18

pre-emption there, because she thought that she would

19

then win on severability analysis and would thereby

20

knock out the entire State statute.

21

underscores is that the unusual Federal pre-emption

22

question here is not necessarily one that is even bad

23

for plaintiffs.

24

What that

It just protects the important Federal

16

determine things like withholding and materiality -

17

you'd have to know everything that FDA had before it,

18

what FDA thought was required as part of that process.

19

You would then have to, I suppose, depose FDA witnesses

20

as to what they would have found to be misleading and

21

what decisions they might have made in hypothetical

22

circumstances.

23

But if you

And those are incredibly intrusive inquiries

that, one, distort manufacturers' incentives in dealing

25

with FDA in the first place; two, if this was seriously

Alderson Reporting Company

going to be litigated would require, I assume, quite a

2

lot of discovery from FDA, which we would resist, but

that's not to say that we would necessarily succeed in

4

our objections.

5
6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

the bribery exception also pre-empted, do you think?

different analysis there.

That's a -- there's a very

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand.

Do you

think -

11

MR. JOSEFFER:

But we do think that that

12

would be pre-empted because -- for a slightly different

13

reason, which is that the relationship between -- the

14

bribery of a Federal official in connection with his

15

Federal duties is obviously a matter of paramount

16

Federal concern, and when the -- especially when the

17

State is looking at that for purposes of essentially

18

second-guessing the validity of a regulatory

19

determination that FDA had made -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

the official pleaded guilty to bribery.

pre-empted then?

MR. JOSEFFER:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me we've got a

2

lot of theoretical litigation out here without much

3

actual experience with any of these cases.

4

MR. JOSEFFER:

You know, what I was going to

5

say is there are a lot of interesting issues surrounding

6

this case, but none of them actually seem to be

7

presented in this case, because here -- I mean, the

8

statute clearly requires a determination of fraud on the

9

FDA, including all the elements I mentioned, as a

10

necessary predicate for recovery; and, two, FDA has not

11

made such a determination.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MS. ZIEVE:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
Warner-Lambert marketed a defective product.

20

It withheld information about the injury the product

21

could cause, and the product caused injury to a great

22

many patients, including Respondents.

23

Warner-Lambert alleging traditional State law claims,

24

such as product defect and failure to warn.

25

to begin by explaining why the misrepresentation
27
Alderson Reporting Company

They sued

I'd like

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exception to the Michigan defense does not implicate the

2

concerns that were raised by the Court in Buckman.

3

Specifically, the Court in Buckman identified three

4

problems or concerns that it thought warranted

5

pre-emption in that case:

6

cause companies to submit too much information and slow

7

down the 510(k) process; that the claim alleged might

8

cause companies not to submit products for approval

9

because of concern about off-label use; and that the

That the claim alleged would

10

claim would cause an unwarranted intrusion on the FDA's

11

decisionmaking about how to police and enforce fraud

12

against it.

13

So the question is:

Does the Michigan law

14

implicate these three concerns any more than traditional

15

State tort litigation against a drug company?

16

I'll start with what I think are the easy

17

ones.

For three reasons, the Michigan statute creates

18

no incentive for manufacturers to submit unnecessary

19

information to the FDA.

20

clearance process that was at issue in Buckman, in this

21

case we have a drug approval.

22

through a comprehensive pre-market approval process.

23

The regulations require submission of, "all available

24

information about the safety of a drug, including

25

demonstrated or potential adverse effects."

Unlike the streamlined 510(k)

Drugs are required to go

28
Alderson Reporting Company

I was

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

quoting from 314.50(b)(5).

2

in its brief, a typical new drug application can be

3

thousands of pages long.

4

only is there not evidence that this 12-year-old statute

5

will lead companies to submit information that the FDA

6

doesn't want and doesn't need; but it's really unclear

7

what such evidence would be because, after all,

8

companies are required to submit all safety information

9

to the FDA, and it's safety information that would be

10
11

As Warner-Lambert points out

So there's not really -- not

relevant to a finding under the Michigan exception.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The converse of that is

12

that the discovery is exhaustive and quite burdensome.

13

I mean, you're trying to say, well, don't worry; there's

14

thousands of documents here; they won't be submitting

15

anything else.

16

against you when we're talking about the intrusiveness

17

on the Federal scheme because you have to have Federal

18

regulators go back through all of this stuff again.

19

But, on the other hand, that cuts

MS. ZIEVE:

No, Your Honor.

The discovery

20

in a case like this -- there is no evidence to suggest

21

it would be any broader or more burdensome than

22

discovery in a typical product liability case against a

23

drug company.

24
25

In that regard, Mr. Joseffer is wrong that
there was no discovery in this case.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

These cases are

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

part of a multidistrict litigation and there was a

2

significant amount of discovery.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All that makes -- makes it

4

worse, in a sense, because what you're saying to me

5

anyway -- and you can explain why I'm not right -- that

6

all of the three things that you mentioned are only

7

aspects of something much more fundamental that

8

underlies all these cases --

9

them.

Medtronics, drugs, all of

You came up and began and said this drug has side

10

effects that hurt people.

And that's a risk when you

11

have a drug, and it's a terrible thing if the drug hurts

12

people.

13

There's a risk on the other side.

14

people who are dying or seriously sick, and if you don't

15

get the drug to them they die.

16

You've got to get drugs to people and at the same time

17

the drug can't hurt them.

18

There are

So there's a problem.

Now, who would you rather have make the

19

decision as to whether this drug is, on balance, going

20

to save people or, on balance, going to hurt people?

21

expert agency, on the one hand, or 12 people pulled

22

randomly for a jury role who see before them only the

23

people whom the drug hurt and don't see those who need

24

the drug to cure them?

25

Now, that it seems to me is Congress's
30
Alderson Reporting Company

An

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fundamental choice, and Congress has opted for the

2

agency.

And that's why we're here -

MS. ZIEVE:

Well -

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- because you want the

jury to do it.

6

that Buckman says the agency should do it.

7

what underlies all my reactions to this, and I might as

8

well get it right out so that you can answer.

9

And it seems to me, reading Buckman,

MS. ZIEVE:

So that's

Well, I think I have a -- State

10

law torts suits aren't seeking to make a determination

11

about whether the product should have gone on the

12

market.

13

compensate injured patients.

14

different role.

15

but it's different.

16

really goes more to the broader issues that the Court

17

will consider next term.

18

The purpose of the State law tort suit is to
That's a fundamentally

It's complementary to the FDA's role,
And I think your question, though,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ms. Zieve, it doesn't

19

object to a system where the -- a court -- the State

20

would come in and give you your tort suit if it's really

21

true that the agency would withdraw this drug.

22

you want is to be able to convince the jury that there

23

was fraud in a situation where the agency doesn't say

24

there was fraud.

25

drug from the market that they want out there.

But what

So what you're doing is removing a

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, that's the theory of Buckman.

2

theory of Buckman is -

3

MS. ZIEVE:

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

But that is not -- they want to save people

5

whom you say they shouldn't because the drug shouldn't

6

be there.

7

why.

8
9

I overstate it slightly.

MS. ZIEVE:

So, explain to me

Well, this case doesn't seek to

pull Rezulin from the market.

Well, first of all,

10

Rezulin was pulled from the market seven years ago.

11

that is not the goal of this case.

12

case is to pay -- to get compensation for people who

13

suffered serious liver damage, every single one of them.

14

About a third of the patient-respondents died from the

15

liver damage caused by Rezulin, and what they're seeking

16

here is not a regulatory remedy; they're seeking damages

17

and compensation for that.

18
19
20

But

The goal of this

And the -- the place where we started with
the JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your premise still is, is

21

that the drug should not have been marketed, or is that

22

your premise?

23
24
25

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, under Michigan law, the

plaintiffs can only JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I know your purpose is

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different, but the premise on which you operate is that

2

the drug should not have been sold.

3
4
5
6

MS. ZIEVE:

-- to the structure of the Michigan statute JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You can back up as long as

you want as long as you come forward and answer.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MS. ZIEVE:

9

(Laughter.)

10

The -- if I can just back up to

MS. ZIEVE:

I promise will.

The Michigan statute takes as

11

its starting point the notion that Federal approval is

12

reliable evidence that a drug company has satisfied the

13

duty -- State law duties of care owed to patients, and

14

then it says:

15

where that reliability is drawn into question.

But there are a couple of situations

16

So, if the company bribes the FDA or the if

17

the company misrepresented important information to the

18

FDA, then the approval is no longer a sufficient basis

19

on which we can just say that approval in and of itself

20

means that the manufacturer satisfied State law duties.

21

And so, the -- the purpose of the finding

22

about whether there was misrepresentation and what the

23

results of it might have been is not to police

24

enforcement with FDA requirements, and it is not to

25

force the drug off the market.

It is only a hurdle that

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the plaintiff has to get past so it can litigate -- he

2

or she can litigate her State law claim the same way

3

plaintiffs will be litigating those claims, and did

4

litigate those claims, with respect to Rezulin in States

5

across the country.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Aren't you going to tell

7

this jury that the drug should not have been on the

8

market?

9

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes.

In Michigan they will have

10

to present evidence that if the company had been honest

11

with the FDA, the product wouldn't have been approved.

12

The discovery in this case shows that it doesn't -- at

13

least in this case, that wouldn't present a big problem.

14

First of all, there is evidence in this

15

case, testimony from the medical officer who reviewed

16

the information, that Rezulin would not have been

17

approved as a standalone therapy, that it is infused

18

without insulin or another drug, if the company hadn't

19

lied about -- withheld adverse event reports.

20

But certainly in the typical case a lot of

21

the information that comes out with respect to what went

22

on before the FDA, not only is it submitted in product

23

liability cases in the first instance by the

24

manufacturer to show all of the hurdles they had to go

25

through to get on the market, doesn't that show our
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

product was safe, but a lot of it you can get in

2

discovery from the company, themselves, as happened in

3

this case.

4

A lot of JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought under the

5

Michigan scheme you don't have to show that.

6

show approval, and that's the end of the case in

7

Michigan.

8
9

MS. ZIEVE:

You just

There are no Michigan cases

explaining just what you need to show to satisfy the

10

defense, so it is unclear whether you have to show that

11

you met -- if it is the right chemical formula, with the

12

label originally approved, or does compliance with

13

approval mean that you also had to show -- one of the

14

terms of approval is that you continued to update your

15

label when you become aware of new safety information;

16

would you have to show -- a manufacturer have to show

17

that to show that the defense was satisfied.

18
19
20

There's no cases under Michigan law which
tell us JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that you

21

could prove that the -- an exception to the defense

22

applies and still lose your lawsuit?

23

MS. ZIEVE:

Absolutely, we could.

Showing

24

that the exception applies is just the first step to

25

being able to litigate this case the way plaintiffs
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

litigated these cases in California, and Illinois, and

2

New York, and other States.

3

There was Rezulin litigation throughout the

4

country.

5

the broad discovery that was done, a lot from

6

Warner-Lambert, some from the FDA, that was no different

7

discovery really than would be required under Michigan.

8

It's all there.

9

And, again, the point about discovery is that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would you explain why you

10

think Mr. Joseffer was wrong when he argued that having

11

a jury decide whether the FDA would have approved the

12

drug or would have withdrawn it from the market if

13

additional or different information had been supplied is

14

incorrect?

15
16
17

Doesn't that -- wouldn't that very seriously
interfere with what the FDA is doing?
MS. ZIEVE:

Well, of course, in the specific

18

facts of this case it wouldn't, because Rezulin is off

19

the market and unapproved.

20

it doesn't affect FDA's regulation because, as I said in

21

response to Justice Stevens, the effect of making that

22

showing and the jury agreeing that the product wouldn't

23

have been approved is -- there's no regulatory effect.

24

The effect is that the plaintiff can then go ahead and

25

litigate her case like she could in any other State.

But even as a general matter

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And that's why -- that's because what

2

Michigan is doing is not policing enforcement.

3

just defining the parameters of the compliance -

There wouldn't be

Well, the parties may seek

There hasn't been enough Michigan litigation

10

for us to know exactly how it would work; but,

11

certainly, the courts in Michigan should be trusted to

12

use their discretion to keep discovery under control as

13

they do in every case.

14

The Rezulin litigation -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wasn't -- in this case

15

one of the charges was that the original FDA examiner

16

had recommended against approval for this drug, and then

17

something happened inside the FDA, and that examiner was

18

taken off the matter, and another one who approved it

19

was put on?

20

Isn't that the kind of thing that the FDA

21

would want to police itself and not have State courts

22

look into?

23

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, those are some of the

24

background facts that happened here.

25

those are the facts that go to a showing of what the FDA
37
Alderson Reporting Company

But I don't think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have done if Warner-Lambert had made honest

2

disclosures, because actually those facts tend to

3

suggest that the FDA did know what was going on.

4

But later the second medical officer, the

5

one who did recommend approval -- the approval came in

6

two stages.

7

with insulin and another drug called Metformin, and

8

later there was an approval for use of Rezulin on its

9

own.

One was for use as a combination therapy

10

That is the use that happened to affect all

11

of my clients, and that's the use where we already have

12

a medical officer who testified that the agency would

13

not have approved for that use if the company hadn't

14

withheld safety information.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what evidence would

you introduce to prove the -- to prove the exception if

the Second Circuit's decision stands?

MS. ZIEVE:

that were stated at the time:

MS. ZIEVE:

Would

No more so than product

liability litigation in any other State.

As I said, the

10

deposition that happened in this case, the plaintiff's

11

committee asked -- they negotiated discovery with the

12

FDA in the Rezulin cases in general, not looking at

13

Michigan specifically at all.

14

from the FDA and the deposition of the medical officer.

15

They got some discovery

There's also a lot of information about

16

approved drugs that the FDA posts as a matter of course

17

on its website, including the medical officer reviews

18

that form the basis for the approval decision.

19

But even in other cases, for instance, the

20

Vioxx MDL that was pending in Louisiana, the -- in that

21

case the FDA wasn't as interested in negotiating, and

22

there was motions to suppress and a motion to compel.

23

And the judge had to decide whether to allow an FDA

24

medical officer to be deposed; and in that case, did.

25

There are other cases where the FDA has not
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wanted discovery and has successfully opposed it.

2

FDA has regulations about that, and there's no evidence

3

that it's burdening the FDA to cooperate to some degree

4

in discovery or the judges are allowing plaintiffs to

5

overrun the FDA with requests they can't handle.

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume that if this drug

12

were still on the market, you could bring forward the

13

information that you have alluded to about the

14

withholding of necessary data by Warner-Lambert, and the

15

FDA would certainly be able to consider that and decide

16

whether sanctions were necessary, withdrawing of the

17

drug was necessary.

18

In this case, the drug has already been

incentive to go into these questions.

21

still would want to go into them if Warner-Lambert were

22

really a bad actor.

23

couldn't they, even though the drug was already

24

withdrawn?

25

So I assume the FDA has at least a reduced
I guess they

They could impose some sanctions,

MS. ZIEVE:

I don't know if they still
40

Alderson Reporting Company

could, but presumably sometime in the past they could

2

have.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think we could have

4

two different rules:

5

there and one for drugs that have since been withdrawn?

6

Because I frankly see little incentive for the FDA, you

7

know, to go back over past mistakes.

8

having been withdrawn, it doesn't matter.

9

One for drugs that are still out

The drug now

But if the drug was still out there, it

10

seems to me you could come forward, and I would be much

11

less sympathetic to what you're trying to do.

12

trust the FDA to do the job.

13

MS. ZIEVE:

You could

Well, the job the FDA is going

14

to do, even if it agrees with a plaintiff, is to

15

sanction the company, perhaps, or to ask it for

16

different information.

17

withdraw approval -

18

It does have the ability to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but once it sanctions

19

the Plaintiff, the Government can't make the argument

20

you are interfering; you are second-guessing the FDA.

21

The FDA would have said:

You didn't give us

22

information that was necessary; and had we known this,

23

we wouldn't have gone ahead.

24
25

MS. ZIEVE:

There's no way for a plaintiff

to compel the FDA to look into a situation of a
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

manufacturer being dishonest for the -- or to -- even if

2

the FDA starts a process for a plaintiff to compel the

3

agency to make a finding that the company

4

withheld material information, and we would not have

5

approved it otherwise.

6

And even if the agency chose to do that, it

7

wouldn't be of any help to the plaintiff because the

8

plaintiff's family is seeking compensation because the

9

breadwinner is dead, or the person is impeded in their

10

ability to make a living in the future and has huge

11

medical bills now.

12

And the FDA's finding that, yes, the company

13

really acted badly isn't going to do anything to help

14

that -- that family.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but it will lead to

16

the drug being withdrawn, in which case there may be

17

just as many people on the other side who are dying,

18

dead, no breadwinner, et cetera, because they didn't get

19

a necessary drug.

20

what happens if the jury is wrong?

21

And that's why what worries me is

You are absolutely right when you say you

22

cannot make the FDA go into this matter and withdraw a

23

drug; and they are absolutely right when they say we

24

cannot promise you that juries will be right.

25

MS. ZIEVE:

But, again 42

Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the the question is:

Who is more likely to be right?

3

MS. ZIEVE:

With respect, I don't think

4

that's the question, because if the jury -- if a

5

Michigan jury is wrong about what would have happened if

6

Warner-Lambert hadn't acted so badly, the result is that

7

Ms. Kent and the other Plaintiffs get to litigate their

8

claims.

9

The result is not -- there is no regulatory JUSTICE BREYER:

Then you think they should

10

be able to litigate a claim where the FDA has approved a

11

drug.

12

Now, is that the law in most places?

Where

13

the FDA has approved a drug for use and the doctor

14

follows the label and the label is all okay, is it the

15

case that somebody can come in and say, despite that,

this drug is on balance harmful, and I get compensation?

3

This is not an expansion of State tort law.
It is a considerable narrowing of State tort law.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, would you say that

5

my characterization of it when Mr. Phillips was

6

presenting his case, that this is an invigorated

7

regulatory compliance defense, that it is more

8

favorable, far more favorable, to the manufacturer than

9

the standard regulatory compliance because it says that

10

the manufacturer is immune, totally immune, unless -

11

and then the exception that we are debating here.

12

But it is a deliberately pro-manufacturer

13

measure.

14

regulatory compliance defense does not.

15

It gives the manufacturer an immunity that the

It's not just pro-manufacturer.

wasn't defective, and that's non-dispositive evidence in

21

almost every State.

22

This statute is the

Other States will allow a manufacturer to

And then a plaintiff can come back and say:

23

Oh, but look, they didn't comply in these ways.

24

that wouldn't be dispositive either in most States.

25

But only in Michigan not only is the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

manufacturer's compliance defense dispositive in the

2

majority of cases, but the evidence of non-compliance

3

isn't even allowed as a rebuttal unless the plaintiff

4

can show that it actually was a material non-compliance

5

that would have made a difference.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in your view could a

7

State prohibit introduction of evidence by the defendant

8

that the drug was approved by the FDA?

9

MS. ZIEVE:

Only to the extent that they

10

simply thought it wasn't relevant.

States that -

don't allow compliance -

20

And there are

MS. ZIEVE:

But I don't think that's
There's no doubt about

There are States that don't

allow compliance evidence if the plaintiff shows

22

material misrepresentation, "material" being that it

23

could have -- could have influenced the agency without a

finding that it did or would have influenced the agency,

but just that it was pertinent information.

In such a case some

And it is sort of the same theory as

It's not meaningful

Because the -

JUSTICE BREYER:

So to me, which is a good

10

answer, is you are saying:

Look at the basic tort

11

system here.

12

Is that -- do you see where I'm -

13

MS. ZIEVE:

And if you can do that, you can do this.

If -- if the traditional tort

14

system as it exists in most every State is not

15

pre-empted, then Michigan's statute is not pre-empted.

16
17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Zieve, how many

States have a statute like Michigan's?
MS. ZIEVE:

The Michigan statute is unique

19

with respect to the finding -- the requirement that

20

there be a finding of how the FDA would have acted if

21

the manufacturer had not made certain representations.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MS. ZIEVE:

No other State does that?

Texas has a similar statute

And one of

Official - Subject to Final Review

just that element is pre-empted, whether you can -

whether Michigan would want to sever that one element.

that certification to the Michigan Supreme Court would

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

though, was quite tied to the whole reason why we think

there's not preemption in the first place, which is that

I didn't think that the

I thought that it had

MR. PHILLIPS:

under Factors we are bound to follow Garcia's

that there is -- that there was no discussion of that in

3

the Sixth Circuit.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

And it seems to me

Oh, but there is a discussion

5

of that in the Sixth Circuit decision.

Garcia

6

specifically deals with that, because it says the bitter

7

that you have to take is if the FDA in fact makes all of

8

the very specific and intricate findings that are

9

required by the exception and concludes that the product

10

should be withdrawn for fraud, then in fact you get the

11

bitter, which is that the lawsuit goes forward under

12

those circumstances, and that that's the reasonable

13

compromise that the State legislature had in mind or

14

would have been satisfied with.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the question is

16

whether the legislature would have passed the statute

17

that it did if in a case like this one the manufacturer

18

could have the immunity without the exception.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

All I'm saying is I think the

20

Court addressed that in Garcia and specifically

21

concluded that the legislature in fact would have passed

22

that; And that traditionally, the Second Circuit would

23

defer, as would this Court.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Does restitution for

victims include damages?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, whatever injuries -

22

yeah, I mean, I don't know exactly what the sweep of

23

restitution would be, but disgorgement of profits would

24

certainly provide a mechanism for providing -

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, you're not talking

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about profits when you have an injured -- a patient who

2

died as a result of malpractice or something.

3

not disgorgement of profits.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's

That's damages.

I understand that.

All I'm

5

suggesting, Justice Stevens, is that there are remedial

6

mechanisms still available to the FDA if in fact it

concluded that there was some problem, and that those -

to a class action of a couple of hundred plaintiffs who

10

were injured, could it?

11

or am I wrong on that?

12

No such remedy under the FDA,

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, as I understood the

13

FDA's position is that they have pretty broad remedial

14

authority and that it extends to some form of

15

restitution to the victims.

16

So I -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The government told us in

17

its brief that the FDA has no system for addressing

18

public complaints -- this was in their brief at page

19

24 -- because that would divert attention from their

20

primary mission.

21

one can bring to the FDA.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

So there's no action for fraud that

Well, I mean, there is a

23

provision for citizen petitions that exists, that's

24

cited.

25

So, yes, there is a mechanism.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But The FDA doesn't have

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

to do anything about it?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no.

3

In point of fact, there was a petition filed by Public

5

it was reviewed and it was rejected for exactly the

reason Justice Breyer identified, because if you took it
