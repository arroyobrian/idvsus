CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument next in Case 08-1332, the City of

5

Ontario v. Quon.

6

Mr. Richland.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. RICHLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under the less restrictive constitutional

12

standards applied when government acts as employer, as

13

opposed to sovereign, there was no Fourth Amendment

14

violation here.

15

First, Ontario Police Sergeant Jeff Quon had

16

no reasonable expectation of privacy vis-à-vis the

17

Ontario Police Department in text messages on his

18

department-issued pager in light of the operational

19

realities of his workplace, which included the explicit

20

no privacy in text messages policy.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

(Laughter.)

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The written policy?

The whole -- the

24

argument here, of course, is that that was modified by

25

the instructions he got from the lieutenant.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Do we

1

follow the written policy or the policy they allegedly

2

enforced in practice?
MR. RICHLAND:

3

That is the argument,

4

Mr. Chief Justice.

5

inconsistency between the no privacy in text messages

6

aspect of the written policy and the oral information

7

he was given.

8
9

But, in fact, there was no

First of all, the written policy itself was
broad enough to cover text messages.

It stated, for

10

example, at Appendix 152, that it applied to city-owned

11

computers and all associated equipment.

12

152:

13

peripheral, city networks, the Internet, e-mail, or

14

other city-related computer services."

15

agreement to the policy was that it applied -- this is

16

at Appendix 156 -- to city-owned computers and related

17

equipment.

18

And again at

"City-owned computer equipment, computer

And, finally, the

So certainly the written policy itself was

19

broad enough to cover text messaging pagers, but in

20

addition to that, nothing in the oral statements made by

21

Lieutenant Duke undermined the no-privacy aspect of the

22

written policy.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

with Mr. Quon's reasonable expectations, right?

25

MR. RICHLAND:

Yes, yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, we are dealing

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And even with the

same time that these text messages were considered

e-mail and could be audited, and that they were

20

considered public records and could be audited at any

time; that is, it has to do with a different aspect of

what the policy -- the oral policy --

there something in writing by the police chief to follow

up after that meeting?

MR. RICHLAND:

There was the

Justice Ginsburg.

There was a memo that was sent that

memorialized the statements at the meeting, that

as e-mail under the written policy.

present --

There’s

That is, he is using his

department-issued pager; he is a police officer and

indeed a member of the high-profile SWAT team of the

2

police department.

3

that fact that there is going to be litigation involving

4

incidents that the SWAT team gets involved in where there

5

will be requests for the communications that are made on

6

that official department-issued pager.

7

He should be aware just by virtue of

And, in addition, he should be aware of the

8

fact -- and this is something that the dissenters to

9

denial of en banc said below.

10

there may be inquiries from boards of the police to

11

determine whether the conduct of the police in a particular

12

incident is appropriate.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Richland, a little

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, the appendix to the

petition.

19

MR. RICHLAND:

Yes, and that's the policy.

20

That is the written policy, Justice Scalia.

21

for the confusion.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22
23

Well, that’s the

written policy.
MR. RICHLAND:

24
25

I'm sorry

That is the written policy,

and the --

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

1

But the policy

2

itself, from the point of view of Officer Quon, is a

3

little bit more complicated than that.
MR. RICHLAND:

4

Well, of course, what the --

5

what Officer Quon's point of view is must also be

6

tempered by what we are reasonably going to accept as a

7

society of his understanding of the circumstances.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

Counsel -You would agree, I

think, that if the SCA, the Stored Communications Act --

11

MR. RICHLAND:

Yes.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If that made it illegal

13

to disclose these e-mails, then he would certainly be correct

14

that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy; isn't that

15

right?

16
17
18
19
20

MR. RICHLAND:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

We

would not agree with that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not reasonable

to assume that people are going to follow the law?
MR. RICHLAND:

Well, for several reasons.

21

Number one, this Court has repeatedly stated that the

22

mere fact that something is contrary to the law does not

23

in itself permit a reasonable expectation of privacy.

24

Just two terms ago, in Virginia v. Moore, this Court

25

said precisely that.

And of course it said it earlier

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in California v. Greenwood, and in a number of other

2

cases -- Oliver v. United States.

3

Because the effect of that, of course, would

4

mean that we would be constitutionalizing every positive

5

law that might be enacted by a State or the

6

Federal legislature.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, on that point, do we

8

take it as the law of the case or as a given that it was

9

illegal for I think Arch to turn over the transcripts to

10

the police department?

11

the case?

12

What do we do with that part of

MR. RICHLAND:

Justice Kennedy, I don’t

13

believe it is law of the case that is binding on this

14

Court, since this Court is a higher court.

15

is true that this Court denied certiorari on that issue,

16

I don't believe it is bound by the Ninth Circuit

17

determination of that, and in fact it is our contention

18

that that was incorrectly decided.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Although it

On remand -- has there been

20

a final judgment issued as to Arch, or is that just

21

being held --

22

MR. RICHLAND:

I don't believe so,

23

Justice Kennedy.

24

stayed pending the determination by this Court.

25

I believe that everything has been

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, let's assume

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that in this police department, everyone knew, the

2

supervisors and everyone else, that the police

3

department people spoke to their girlfriends at night.

4

MR. RICHLAND:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And one of the chiefs,

6

out of salacious interest, decides:

7

go in and get those texts, those messages, because I

8

just have a prurient interest.

9

any expectation of privacy that his boss won't just

10
11

I'm going to just

Does that officer have

listen in out of prurient interest?
MR. RICHLAND:

Justice Sotomayor, as to the

12

first aspect, the question of reasonable expectation of

13

privacy, the motive should have no impact.

14

of looking should have no impact.

15

reasonable expectation of privacy must be analyzed

16

according to the relationship between the officer and

17

his -- and his employer.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The motive

The question of

But if in fact -- and

19

whether we agree with this conclusion or not, we accept

20

the lower court's views that there was an expectation

21

that the chiefs were not going to read these things,

22

some expectation of privacy --

23

MR. RICHLAND:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Yes.
-- the limits of it have

to be limited for all of the reasons you’ve said, doesn't

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this case begin and end on whether or not what the jury

2

found is reasonable grounds for what the city did?

3

MR. RICHLAND:

I think that what this case

4

begins and ends with, if we assume that there was a

5

reasonable expectation of privacy, is under the

6

plurality opinion in O'Connor:

7

itself was reasonable.

8

make a determination as to the purpose of the search.

9

Whether the search

And the jury did, of course,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess we don't decide

10

our -- our Fourth Amendment privacy cases on the basis

11

of whether there -- there was an absolute guarantee of

12

privacy from everybody.

13

say that if you think it can be made public by anybody,

14

you don't -- you don't really have a right of privacy.

I think -- I think those cases

15

So when the -- when the filthy-minded police

16

chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not --

17

it’s not offending your right of privacy.

18

somebody else could listen in, if not him.

19
20

MR. RICHLAND:

You expected

I think that's correct,

Justice Scalia.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. RICHLAND:

I think it is.
And I think the reason why

23

you must have the two-step analysis in a case of this

24

sort -- that is, first look at the question as to

25

whether there’s a reasonable expectation of privacy,

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and then determine, if there was, whether the search was

2

reasonable -- is precisely for the reason that, without

3

that, what we will have in every case is the claim that

4

there was a salacious reason, that that was the reason.

5

And we’ll be litigating every one of those cases --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then, according to what

7

you just said, the jury determination was superfluous.

8

If there was no reasonable expectation of privacy

9

because the officers were told this is just -- we

10

treat this just like e-mails, it can be monitored, it

11

can be made public, then there would be no reasonable

12

expectation of privacy and there would be no question to

13

go to the jury.
MR. RICHLAND:

14

That’s correct,

15

Justice Ginsburg.

16

should never have gone to the jury, that summary

17

judgment should have been granted in favor of the

18

Ontario Police Department.

19

And it is our position that this

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you have two arguments:

20

One, that it's -- there’s no reasonable expectation of

21

privacy; even if there were, that this was a reasonable

22

search.

23

MR. RICHLAND:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

That’s correct.
Is reasonable expectation

of privacy a judge question or a jury question?

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. RICHLAND:

Well, if there is a conflict

2

in the facts, I presume the jury must resolve those --

3

that factual conflict.

4

believe there is a conflict in the facts, and, therefore,

5

it is a judge question.

6

But in this case, I don't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did your client

7

treat on-duty text messages different from off-duty text

8

messages?

MR. RICHLAND:

MR. RICHLAND:

Well, I'm serious.

don't have to ignore it.
MR. RICHLAND:

Justice Kennedy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

sorry.

16

right?

I still don't understand.

17
18

I think that’s correct,

MR. RICHLAND:

It redacted them,

Redacted because the inquiry

-- the second stage of the inquiry in Internal Affairs --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. RICHLAND:

much time was being spent on duty sending personal messages.

No, it was the other way

the later stage, at the Internal Affairs stage.

12

they looked at all of the text messages when the only

purpose for the inquiry was to determine how many of the

they had to respond to emergencies.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we take it that the

3

Stored Communications Act does say that the provider may

4

not give out the transcripts, if we take that as given,

5

then how can the department lawfully use the

6

transcripts?

7

MR. RICHLAND:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, first

8

of all, there was no -- there is no current claim that

9

anything that the department did with respect to the

10

Stored Communications Act was unlawful.

11

that the other entity, Arch Wireless, violated the

12

Stored Communications Act, but that would not preclude

13

the department -- which was, after all, the subscriber

14

-- from requesting to see what, in fact, the transcripts

15

disclosed.

16

So it may be

But in addition to that, there is also the

17

fact that, as I said before, a reasonable expectation of

18

privacy couldn't be based simply on the fact that there

19

was a statute, and particularly not a statute like the

20

Stored Communications Act, because that's a statute that’s

21

extremely, extremely technical.

22

one has to determine whether an entity was working

23

either as an electronic communications service or a

remote computing service, and so on.

25

over the board on this.

And there is a --

Courts are all

As this Court noted in United

the Chief Justice's opinion in Engquist v. Oregon about

the greater amount of leeway that the government has

hypothetical is that the -- that there is a legal

23

counsel's opinion that this was in violation of the Act,

standard that had to be nationwide.

14

same -- same thing here?

15

MR. KATYAL:

So you say it's the

I -- I do think it’s the same,

16

and for this simple reason, that when you have a

17

nationwide standard or a State standard, it’s to fill

18

the gap, whatever isn’t necessarily protected by the

19

Fourth Amendment.

20

And here --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the -- in the context of the exclusionary rule in

criminal proceedings.

at least we could make the reasonable argument that

24

States can have different policies with respect to their

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.

I

2

don't disagree with that.

3

if the -- if I understand your question it’s, does a

4

Federal statute about privacy somehow matter to the

5

Fourth Amendment analysis about reasonable expectations

6

of privacy?

7

precisely because Congress enacted the Stored

8

Communications Act to fill gaps in Fourth Amendment law.

9

That -- that's why it's enacted.

10

I think the only question is,

And there our contention is, no; it’s

And for -- for this Court to then use that

11

very Act to be the template on which reasonable

12

expectations of privacy may spring I think would be a

13

very -- it would be a novel proposition.
JUSTICE ALITO:

14

Nor should --

Well, that's -- that's a

15

little bit puzzling because there are -- electronic

16

communications are stored all over the place in -- and

17

there isn't a history -- these are -- these are

18

relatively new.

20

private.

21

out in front of your house, which has happened for a

22

long time.

23

There isn't a well-established

It's a little different from putting garbage

If -- if statutes governing the privacy of

24

that information don't have any bearing on reasonable

25

expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, it's

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some -- I -- I'm at something of a loss to figure out

2

how to determine whether there is a reasonable

3

expectation of privacy regarding any of those things.

4

MR. KATYAL:

Well, Justice Alito, I do think

5

that the underlying premise of your question is one with

6

which we entirely agree.

7

are rapidly in flux, in which we don't have intuitive

8

understandings the way we do about, say, trash and so

9

on.

These are technologies that

And it's precisely for that reason I think the

10

Court should be very careful to constitutionalize and

11

generate Fourth Amendment rules in this area at the

12

first instance.

13

To do so I think really does freeze into --

14

into -- into place something that the legislature can't

15

then fix, going to Justice Kennedy's opinion in, for

16

example, Murray v. Giarratano, in which he said that

17

constitutionalizing in that area -- constitutionalizing

18

may pretermit legislative solutions.

19

Now, here the Stored Communications Act is

20

not violated under any way, shape, or form.

The Stored

21

Communications Act has two different provisions in it,

22

one having to do with remote -- remote computing

23

services, RCSs.

24

facilities.

communications service.

That's when an entity offers storage

And the other is for an electronic

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your point that you

3

made just a moment ago, that we don't want to freeze into

4

place the constitutional requirements with respect to

5

new technology, I wonder if it cuts the other way.

6

dealing with an amendment that looks to whether

7

something is reasonable.

8

better course to say that the Constitution applies, but

9

we’re going to be more flexible in determining what’s

And I think it might be the

10

reasonable because they are dealing with evolving

11

technology.
MR. KATYAL:

12

We’re

Well, I think that the -- the

13

best way -- I think the most -- the easiest way for the

14

Court to resolve this is to simply say that when we are

15

dealing with what is reasonable, we look to the policy.

16

And here there’s a policy by the employer, it says that

17

computer-associated -- computer-related equipment and

18

others, there’s no expectation of privacy.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

You have a

Well, but that puts

21

a lot of weight -- I mean, there are some things where we

22

don't bind them.

23

garage thing that has got all this small print on the

24

back.

25

because nobody reads it.

You know, you get the usual parking

We -- we don't say that you’re bound by that,

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But in here, I just don't know.

I just

2

don't know how you tell what’s reasonable -- I suspect

3

it might change with how old people are and how

4

comfortable they are with the technology -- when you have

5

all these different -- different factors.

6

You know, they’re told you can use it for

7

private; you’ve got to pay for it.

8

it, it's mine, and it’s not the employer's.

9

MR. KATYAL:

I think if I pay for

Well, I think the clearest way,

10

Mr. Chief Justice, to decide what is reasonable and what

11

isn't is actually the terms of the policy.

12

to me very little is more unreasonable than expecting

13

a right to privacy after you’ve been told in a

14

policy you have no privacy.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it seems

Suppose we find a right of

16

privacy.

17

you also -- in order to sustain this lawsuit, wouldn't

18

you also have to find that it was an unreasonable --

19

Is that the end of the case?

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.

I mean, wouldn't

There are two

20

arrows in the city's quiver, and I think they're right

21

as to both of them.

22
23
24
25

But --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What’s the government's

position on the unreasonableness of the search?
MR. KATYAL:

The government's position is

that the Ninth Circuit just from the get-go got the

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

standard wrong by citing -- by using a Schowengerdt test

2

which was, was this -- was this search the least

3

restrictive alternative?

4

repeatedly said that's the wrong way of thinking about

5

it, that that puts judges in the position of

6

second-guessing searches on the ground, that they’re

7

not really fully -- fully equipped to do so.

8
9

And we think this Court has

So I do think that is a possible way to
resolve this, Justice Scalia, but --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. KATYAL:

Maybe an easier way, huh?

Well, I don't know that it's

12

easier, in the following sense:

13

of employers across the country rely on these policies

14

and millions of employees.

15

decision puts that reliance in some jeopardy, because it

16

said that you can have an official policy and it can be

17

taken back by what some ad hoc subordinate says.

18

that is, I think, a very destructive notion to the idea

19

of reliance on these policies and setting --

20

I think that thousands

And the Ninth Circuit's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

So, your -- your

21

position would require people basically to have two of

22

these things with them, two whatever they are,

23

text messager or the BlackBerries or whatever, right?

24

Because assuming they’re going to get personal things,

25

you know, some emergency at home, they’re also going to

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

get work things --

2

MR. KATYAL:

To the -- under this policy,

3

yes.

You might have an employer that sets a different

4

policy and allows for some de minimis use and a zone of

5

privacy in that use.

6

different things.

7

is to have a blanket rule that constitutionalizes and

8

says you always have reasonable expectations of privacy

9

in this technology.

You can have a variety of

But what I think would be dangerous

The result may be,

10

Mr. Chief Justice, that employers then won't give that

11

technology at all to their employees and -- and

12

eliminate even that de minimis use.

13

Mr. Chief Justice, you had also asked before

14

about the standpoint of Quon in -- in evaluating

15

the reasonableness of the search -- of the search in his

16

perspective of the policy.

17

way of looking at it.

18

is the written policy, what it says, and that is the

19

simplest way, I think, to provided administrability to

20

the lower courts.

21

in existence, and not get into those questions of is it

22

like a parking ticket, did I flip through it too

23

quickly, did I understand that the policy and the like.

24
25

We think that is the wrong

Instead, we think the proper test

They can simply say was this policy

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You want to -- you want

to -- you want to undo O'Connor's operational realities

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the workplace and say the minute you issued a written

2

policy that renders all searches okay, even if the

3

operational realities are different?

4

MR. KATYAL:

Not at all, Justice Sotomayor.

5

I take it the language about operational realities in

6

the workplace, what is right next to it is looking to

7

whether or not there are regulations in place, and here

8

a policy is a regulation.

9

And so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You may have an argument

10

that the nature of the policy here and all of the

11

activities related to it don't prove an operational

12

reality of privacy, but I don't know why -- you want a

13

flat rule that says once you have a written policy,

14

there’ no expectation of privacy.
MR. KATYAL:

15

And I think that is -- that is

16

what O'Connor says with respect to the -- as long as the

17

policy is in place, that -- that's what O'Connor

18

permits.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. DAMMEIER:

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I think an underlying fact that we might be

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

skipping over is -- is -- and both the lower courts

2

recognize this -- that the computer policy that the

3

department had didn't apply to the pagers on its own.

4

It -- it only came into play after Lieutenant Duke

5

modified that policy and told people at the -- at the

6

meeting that was referred to earlier that the pagers are

7

now going to be applying with -- with this policy.

8

It -- it --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is -- why is that so?

10

I mean, it did say associated equipment.

11

an employee is told now e-mails aren't private, so we’re

12

warning you, we can monitor them, wouldn't such an

13

employee expect the same thing to apply to the pager?
MR. DAMMEIER:

14

And -- and if

Well, the policy itself has

15

two components to it.

16

all associated equipment for personal business.

17

One is, don't use our equipment,

The other part of that policy deals with the

18

no privacy, and it informs the people there could be

19

monitoring.

20

of that policy, which is at Appendix 156 of the

21

petition, it specifically says the city will

22

periodically monitor e-mail, Internet use, and computer

23

usage.

24
25

And specifically on the acknowledgment form

And -- and, again, I think this is why the -both lower courts came to the conclusion that the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

computer policy on its own wasn't in play until

2

Lieutenant Duke announced that, hey, now the pagers are

3

going -- are going to be in play with this computer

4

policy.

5

This is the same Lieutenant Duke -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But my question is, an

6

employee reads this policy and says, oh, my e-mails are

7

going to be subject to being monitored --

8

MR. DAMMEIER:

Sure.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wouldn't that employee

10

expect that the policy would carry over to pagers?

11

would -- when you think of what's the reason why they want

12

to look at the e-mails, wouldn't the same reason apply?

13

MR. DAMMEIER:

I mean,

Well, I'm sure the same

14

reasons could apply, but the -- the city is the one that

15

writes the rules here.

16

clear on what it applies to, it certainly should be on

17

them to write them clear so the employee understands.

18

The -- if they want to make it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe -- maybe

19

everybody else knows this, but what is the difference

20

between a pager and e-mail?

21

MR. DAMMEIER:

Sure.

The e-mail, looking at

22

the computer policy -- that goes through the city's

23

computer, it goes through the city's server, it goes

24

through all the equipment that -- that has -- that the

25

city can easily monitor.

Here the pagers are a separate

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

device that goes home with you, that travels with you,

2

that you can use on duty, off duty, and -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3
4

You can do that with

e-mails.

5

MR. DAMMEIER:

Certainly, certainly.

But in

6

this -- in this -- in this instance with the pagers, it went

7

through no city equipment; it went through Arch Wireless

8

and then was transmitted to another -- another person.

9

So, again, to Duke -- Duke is the one that

10

said:

Hey, this -- this comes into play.

11

Lieutenant Duke is also the one that gave the privacy

12

guarantee to the SWAT team members and said:

13

you pay the overages, we’re not going to look at your

14

pagers; we're not going to look at the messages.

15

-- if you couple both of those modifications, both by

16

the same lieutenant -- and he wasn't just some

17

subordinate; he was the lieutenant in charge of the

18

administrative bureau; he was the administrative bureau

19

commander.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

But

As long as

So if

I thought that he said --

21

he was saying:

But as far as billing is concerned, I'm

22

not going to look at these; if you use more than 25,000

23

characters, you pay the extra, and that will be the end

24

of it.

25

whether those in excess of 25,000 characters were for

If you contest that, then I’ll look to see

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

work purposes or private purposes.

2

And so he's talking about the billing.

He

3

hasn't retracted what was said at the meeting about -- that

4

these text messages are subject to audit.

5

MR. DAMMEIER:

This -- this is what Sergeant

6

Quon testified to, that he attributed to Lieutenant

7

Duke:

8

fee.

If you don't want us to read it, pay the overage

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what’s wrong with his

10

deciding:

I don't like to do this anymore?

11

want to collect all this money; it's too complicated;

12

and so I don't know how many of these messages are

13

related to work and how many they are just mucking

14

around prying into each other's business.

15

MR. DAMMEIER:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

He can certainly -So I would like to know, so

17

therefore I'm going to look and see.

18

unreasonable about that?

19
20

I don't

MR. DAMMEIER:

Now, what’s

Well, he certainly could say

I don't want to do this anymore, and he could --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, no.

22

MR. DAMMEIER:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

-- the city owns the pager.

25

They are giving a privilege to people if they want to

And he could tell everybody.
I'm saying what's
It's a pager used for work.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

use it off work.

2

of collection, and so what he wants to do is he wants to

3

see how much of this is being used for work and how much

4

is of this not being used for work.

5
6

It seems to be involving a big amount

My question, which I just repeated, is why
is that an unreasonable thing?

7

MR. DAMMEIER:

8

unreasonable, Your Honor.

9

I don't think that request is

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

And then if that’s

10

not unreasonable, why is what went on here that is

11

any different?

12

MR. DAMMEIER:

Well, here the jury -- the

13

only fact that was determined by the jury was the reason

14

for the search.

15

petition page 119.

16

jury made as to the purpose of the search:

17

the efficacy of the existing character limits to ensure

18

that officers were not being required to pay for the

19

work-related expenses.

20
21

And that's found at the appendix to the
This is the only finding that the

JUSTICE BREYER:

How does that differ from

what I just said?

22

MR. DAMMEIER:

23

play on -- on the scope of the search.

24
25

To determine

Well, it -- it comes into

JUSTICE BREYER:

Again --

No, I understand.

I thought

it's just a more -- a few more words to say just what I

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

said.

That they wanted to look into this because they

2

are tired about collecting so much money.

3

It's the third time I've said the same

4

thing; probably it's my fault I’m not being clear.

5

it looked as if they wanted to know how many are being

6

sent for work purposes, how many for private purposes

7

including prying into people's business, which wasn't

8

too desirable, and -- and -- so that they could get

9

the -- the charges right.

10

But

Now, that sounds like what the jury said they

11

were doing, too.

12

anything, quite honestly, unreasonable about that, where

13

you’re the employer, where it's a SWAT team, where --

14

where -- where you’re paying for this in the first

15

place.

16

clearly to explain what's unreasonable about it.

17
18
19
20
21

And my question was -- I don't see

So the reason I ask it is I would like you

MR. DAMMEIER:

The scope of the search was

unreasonable.
JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the conclusion.

Now,

what's your reason?
MR. DAMMEIER:

Under -- under -- looking at

22

O'Connor, you have to -- you have to look to make sure

23

that the search is not excessively intrusive.

24

what they did was they took all the messages and started

25

reading them.

Here,

Given the purpose, the limited purpose

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that was found by the jury for the search, they didn't

2

need to do that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

3
4

Well, explain that one to

me.

5

MR. DAMMEIER:

They --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Being naive about this, if

7

I had a -- like, 20, 30,000 characters in 1,800 messages

8

and I wanted to know which are personal and which are

9

work-related, a good way to get at least a good first

10

cut would be to read them.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay?

So I start off

13

thinking that seems to be reasonable to me.

14

I would do.

15

MR. DAMMEIER:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

That's what

Well, that's certainly one -So all right.

Now you tell

me why that isn't reasonable.
MR. DAMMEIER:

18

That's one of the ways they

19

could have done it.

20

have got consent from the officers first to do it.

21

could have had the officers themselves count the

22

messages.

23

were paying for the overages.

24
25

They could have got -- they could
They

After all, the officers were the ones that

But the

MR. DAMMEIER:

All right.

So what -- that

What's the other way?

Well, they could have -- they

12

could have had the officers themselves count the

13

messages.
JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Well, the officer is going

15

to say, hey, these are all big -- work-related.

16

tell you that.

I’ll

I only had two.

17

MR. DAMMEIER:

Well --

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. DAMMEIER:

Okay.
Okay.

What's a third way?
They -- the lieutenant

21

could have said, hey, we're going to stop this practice

that I started, and from this month forward make sure

23

all you do is business-related.

are --

MR. DAMMEIER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

You want to -- there

The -Look, so far I listened to four

5

things, and I'm just being naive about it.

6

more closely, but I don't see why these four things are

7

so obviously more reasonable than what they did.

9
10
11

MR. DAMMEIER:

I’ll read it

They also -- they could have

had the officers redact the private messages and then
given it -- given it to the department.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But suppose that their

12

application of what -- how much was being spent on

13

business-related, all of your suggestions about having

14

the officer do things does nothing about their application.

15

MR. DAMMEIER:

Well --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You’re -- you’re

17

relying on the very person you’re auditing to do the

18

audit for you.

19

business-wise.

20

That doesn't seem either practical or

MR. DAMMEIER:

Well, other than my one

21

sample of -- example of saying, hey, let's -- let's stop

22

the personal use and we’re going to have a test month

23

to determine exactly how many messages we need for our

24

business-related purposes.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That goes back to -- I

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't understand that.

2

person you’re auditing to say to you I’m only using

3

it for business.

4

You’re still relying on the

That -- that's just not logical.

MR. DAMMEIER:

Well, but the -- the sole

5

purpose of the search was only to find out if officers

6

were paying for business-related messages that they

7

didn't need to pay for.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the question, in the

Constitution, the word is "unreasonable."

Is it a

10

reasonable or unreasonable?

So the question -- what I

11

asked is not maybe you would have gotten a better result

12

if you had hired Bain Associates and Bain would have

13

done a 4-month study at a cost of $50,000.
But I could say a person who doesn't want

14
15

to hire Bain and who doesn't want to rely on the

16

unverified word of the officers who were using these for

17

God knows what is not being unreasonable.

18

ultimate issue.

19

to show me that what they did was unreasonable.

21

And that's why I’m putting it to you

MR. DAMMEIER:

20

That's the

I think it comes down from

that perspective on the excessiveness of the search.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

The only reason --

23

the only reason the officer would not be accurate -- I

24

mean, I don't understand why the redaction is such a bad

25

idea.

He just says these are private.

37
Alderson Reporting Company

And that allows

10

MR. DAMMEIER:

I do.

We, in our brief, try

to analogize that to the mail.

and, again, analogizing to the mail, they have an

expectation of privacy while that message is in the

20

So I -- I think --

Well --

Well, suppose it was

for work and that you have no privacy interest in it

2

whatsoever; we’re going to monitor this every day.

3

And then these other individuals sent him messages.

4

You would still say they have an expectation

5

of privacy in those messages?

6

MR. DAMMEIER:

Until the point that it’s on

7

Quon's pager.

8

could have obtained the messages from Quon, but they

9

went over to Arch, the equivalent of the Post Office,

10
11

I think under that scenario, that they

and got them from them.
It's like if I -- I make a copy of a letter

12

before I send it to somebody.

13

I might not know what happens and I might lose my

14

expectation of privacy down the road, but that copy I

15

kept, I think there is still an expectation.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, down the road,

Well, what -- when you send

17

a text message to somebody else, aren't you quite aware

18

that that text message will remain confidential only to

19

the extent that either the recipient keeps it

20

confidential -- and he can disclose it -- or somebody

21

else who has power over the recipient or over the

22

recipient's phone chooses to look at it?

23

that understood when you send somebody a text message?

MR. DAMMEIER:

issue.

But here, again, had they

gotten consent from -- from Quon and got it from him

directly, that's a -- that's a different story.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. DAMMEIER:

And -- and like, when I get a

but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to

4

the Post Office and get my mail before I get it.

5

think -- I think that, you know, certainly adds a little

6

bit to the correspondence that dealt with --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But just -- just to

8

be clear:

9

Quon that there’d be no problem from the point of

You think if these messages went straight to

view of the senders?

11

getting them from Quon?

13

I mean, no problem in searching --

MR. DAMMEIER:

I think it's certainly a

harder argument for me to make --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. DAMMEIER:

16

I

Yes.

-- that they have an

expectation after -- after Quon has it.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So we have to assume

18

for your argument to succeed that they know that this goes

19

somewhere else and then it’s processed and then it goes

20

to Quon.

21

MR. DAMMEIER:

Yes, but I think in today's

22

-- I think in today's society that's -- that's a

23

reasonable assumption to make.

of how the process worked.

7

So there was some understanding

Can an officer who has one

of these pagers delete messages from the pager --

8

MR. DAMMEIER:

MR. DAMMEIER:

14

MR. DAMMEIER:

15

like if they received a letter, they could be put in the

Suppose I sent somebody a

have also published the letter in a letter to the editor

I have written the following letter

to Sergeant Quon.

Do I still have a right -- a right of

privacy in that letter?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

situation here.

3

the message is one thing, but she's made -- made the

message public effectively by sending it to Quon.

5

it gets to Quon, she knows that Quon can make it public

6

or that the employer can -- can find out about it.

government could just go in and -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly.

That -- and

14

that's why you have the statute, because the Fourth

15

Amendment wouldn't solve the problem, because you are

16

effectively making it public by sending it to somebody

17

whom you don't know is immune from disclosure.

18

order to stop the intermediary from making it public,

19

you needed the statute.

the Fourth Amendment would solve the problem, right?

So, in

Otherwise you wouldn't need it;

Well, certainly, obviously

22

the statute could come into play in addition to the

23

Fourth Amendment.

the mail analogy.

Just because at the end of the line

25

somebody might disseminate my letter doesn't lose an

keep.

5

kept or the Post Office is keeping in the course of

6

delivery.

7

I still enjoy an expectation -- and the Fourth

Certainly, at the end of the line, that letter

8

could be published to the world, but that's not the same

9

thing as the government coming in and getting a copy of

10
11

it while it was being delivered.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you sure that -- are you

12

sure about your answer to the question of deletion?

13

It's not like deleting something from a computer which

14

doesn't really delete it from the computer?

15

MR. DAMMEIER:

Honestly, I'm not -- that's

16

not in the record, and the -- how that pager works as

17

far as deleting, I couldn't be certain that it would be

18

deleted forever.

19

I would certainly not.

One -- one of the points to -- to raise,

20

too, was that most of these texts took place off duty

21

when dealing with Sergeant Quon.

22

looking at the actual practice that O'Connor has us look

23

at, you know, here again --

24
25

record was the opposite, that in fact most of the calls

happening on duty.

MR. DAMMEIER:

There were -- there were a

one day was 80.

7

about 15 seconds.

8

of about 7 minutes during -- during a work day.

9

I think it was broken down to

But also they talked about -- they took

But the testimony of Sergeant Quon was that

10

most of these were actually off-duty.

11

certainly -- I think that should come into play, given

12

the department -- they gave them pagers.

13

a one-way use; it wasn't, hey, this is, you know, for the

14

benefit of the employee.

15

I mean, they wanted to be able to have these SWAT guys

16

show up quickly, respond quickly, and there was a mix on

17

-- on the reasons for these pagers.

18

And, you know, I

And it wasn't

The department received a benefit.

The exchange was, we’re going to let you

19

use these for personal purposes, and given that reality,

20

you should be able to have some -- some expectation of

privacy in that use.

22

I'm a public employee and I call my wife, I should be

able to have some expectation of privacy in a

about guys that are on 24/7.

Correct.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHARDS

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20

MR. RICHLAND:

Thank you.

I would first

21

like to just make it clear that what it is being claimed

22

was the guarantee of privacy by Lieutenant Duke is

23

really absolutely not that at all.

24

the Court to Joint Appendix page 40, which does summarize

25

that, and it says -- here is what precisely what

Lieutenant Duke said:

Lieutenant Duke went to Sergeant Quon and told him the

3

city-issued two-way pagers were considered e-mail and

4

could be audited."

5

"Because of the overage

So that's what he said first.

Then he said -- he told Sergeant Quon it was

6

not his -- his intent to audit employees' text messages

7

to see if the overages were due to work-related

8

transmissions.

9

He advised Sergeant Quon he, Sergeant Quon,

10

could reimburse the city for the overages so he, Duke,

11

would not have to audit the transmission and see how

12

many messages were non-work-related.

13

told Sergeant Quon he is doing this because if anybody

14

wished to challenge their overage, he could audit the

15

text transmissions to verify how many were

16

non-work-related, and then, finally, Lieutenant Duke

17

added, the text messages were considered public records

18

and could be audited at any time.

19

Lieutenant Duke

That is what is being characterized as a

20

guarantee of privacy.

21

way undercuts the official written policy.

It's hard to see how that in any

Mr. Richland, do you take

24

Steve Trujillo stand in the same position as Sergeant

MR. RICHLAND:

We do, with respect -- in at

2

least one respect, and that is:

3

then we think the other plaintiffs must also lose.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. RICHLAND:

If Sergeant Quon loses,

Why?
Yes.

The reason for that is

6

that this Court has held on many occasions that, once

7

one has sent a communication or an object to another

8

person, they lose their expectation of privacy in --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That means the

10

government can set up an interception mechanism on

11

telephone transmissions, on e-mail, computer

12

transmissions --

13
14

MR. RICHLAND:

It -- it does not mean that,

Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

If it doesn't mean that,

16

answer his argument that, yes, you could take anything

17

from Quon, but the storage -- you went to the storage

18

facility, which is a Post Office.

19

MR. RICHLAND:

And he says it's a Post

20

Office, but the truth is that all of these plaintiffs

21

admitted that they knew that this was a

22

department-issued pager, and this wasn't a Post Office.

23

Arch Wireless was the department's agent.
These text messages were being sent to

24
25

someplace.

Both the written policy and the oral policy

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

So you have to get

into who owned --

4

MR. RICHLAND:

Excuse me.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Whether this was a -- we

6

have to get into the Storage Act and figure out whether

7

this was an RCN or ACS?

8
9

MR. RICHLAND:

Well, I think that -- I

don't know that it's necessary to do that, because I

10

think that all that must be determined is -- and I don't

11

think whether it's an ECS or RCS is -- you would require

12

that to determine who owned it, because it was clear

13

that Arch acted solely as the city's agent.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Whoa, whoa.

I'm not sure

15

you’re doing the city a favor by making Arch the city's

16

agent --

17

MR. RICHLAND:

I understand --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- as opposed to an

19

independent contractor who is doing business with the

20

city.

MR. RICHLAND:
