CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

Berghuis v. Thompkins.

Mr. Restuccia.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. ERIC RESTUCCIA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

In rejecting Mr. Thompkins's Miranda claim

12

and ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the

13

Michigan courts did not unreasonably apply clearly

14

established Supreme Court precedent.

15

the Miranda claim.

16

I plan to focus on

Now, with respect to the Miranda claim, there

17

really are two distinct inquiries at issue.

18

is whether Mr. Thompkins impliedly waived his rights

19

under the Fifth Amendment and, second, whether he

20

invoked his right to remain silent during a police

21

interview.

22

The first

Regarding the waiver question, this Court

23

established in Butler that there may be an implied

24

waiver, even where a suspect remains silent after having

25

received his Miranda warnings, where that suspect
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

knowingly receives his rights and there is a course of

2

conduct that indicates waiver.

3

The Michigan courts here did not

4

unreasonably conclude that Mr. Thompkins had impliedly

5

waived his rights where he expressly acknowledged his

6

rights under -- from his form.

7

from that form, he participated in a limited fashion

8

during the interview.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

After having read out loud

But he didn't -- he

10

didn't waive them.

11

if I have it right, said, "I'll talk to you."

12

was a statement --

And quite unlike Butler -- Butler,

13

MR. RESTUCCIA:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that

But --- that he was waiving

15

the right to remain silent.

16

Here there was no such indication that there was a

17

waiver of his right to remain silent.

18

He volunteered to talk.

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Although in Butler this

19

Court noted that -- that Butler himself had remained

20

silent and did not answer the -- answer at all, or

21

remained silent when asked whether he wished to waive

22

his right to counsel.

23

established from which the Michigan courts relied is

24

really on this -- this language of the standard

25

established from Butler, that you can -- you can imply

So the -- the standard that was

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

waiver from the knowing reception, and then a course of

2

conduct, because the -- the inference can be drawn from

3

the words and actions of the person interrogated.

4

here --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Could you tell me

6

without more detail, which is what the circuit court

7

said, about what the limited responses -- I'm using your

8

word -- were.

9

How do we -- how can we imply waiver?

MR. RESTUCCIA:

10

Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning if all he said

11

was, yes, I want them in, that's much different than

12

saying, if someone had asked him, do you want to leave,

13

and he shakes his head no.

14

that he waived, but the former certainly would be

15

neutral.

16

The latter might imply to me

MR. RESTUCCIA:

I have to

17

carefully delineate between waiver and invocation.

18

here the waiver occurs at the time that he is asked the

19

series of questions:

20

pray to God?

25

That happened about 2

hours and 15 minutes into the exercise, didn't it?
MR. RESTUCCIA:

23
24

Do you

Did you pray for forgiveness -JUSTICE BREYER:

21
22

Do you believe in God?

So

That's right.

It happened

near the -JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So -- so what we

1

have here is a course of conduct, 2 hours and 15 minutes

2

of saying nothing.

MR. RESTUCCIA:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5
6

Well, we ­
Would you say that

that's -- that's gone past the point where -MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, this -- if you're

7

looking at what has been clearly established for this

8

Court, this Court has never -- I mean, one of the

9

arguments raised against the position I'm

10

advocating is that there is an immediacy requirement.

11

Well, this Court in Butler didn't say that the waiver

12

had to occur immediately.

13
14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

In Butler he said:

I will

talk to you, but I am not signing any forms.
MR. RESTUCCIA:

That's right.

But if you

16

look at what's the clearly established law -- this Court

17

identified the standard, what can be inferred from the

18

words and actions of the person interrogated.

19

you look at what the two --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if

What they say is, "a course

21

of conduct" -- we will not hold -- "This does not mean a

22

defendant's silence, coupled with an understanding and a

23

course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a

24

conclusion...."

25

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Right.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the prosecution's

burden is great.

3

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Right.

And if -- if you

4

look at the two aspects of what constitutes a waiver,

5

it's knowing and intelligent, and voluntary.

6

time that Mr. Thompkins gave his answer to that series

7

of questions, there's nothing in the course of that

8

interview that suggested that no longer did he know that

9

he didn't have to answer questions.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

At the

But going back to Justice

11

Sotomayor's question, is there anything during the 2

12

hours and 15 minutes that could suggest a waiver?

13

MR. RESTUCCIA:

The -- the -- the waiver

14

occurs at the time that he answered the question.

15

answer is that he didn't waiver before then, but that --

16

it still is evidence to show that that course -- that

17

nothing the police had done -- there were no threats --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do we do with

19

our case law that says that you can't infer waiver

20

simply from the confession?

21

MR. RESTUCCIA:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24

that.

So the

Well, the -I mean, we have said

So that's pretty clearly established statement -MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, the --

25
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. RESTUCCIA:

-- by the Court.

The courts on direct review

3

have allowed -- where there's a knowing reception of

4

one's rights, have allowed the answers themselves to

5

provide the evidence that the person did waive his

6

rights.

7

In fact -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I think certainly

8

in -- in Butler, if someone in their confession says, I

9

know I don't have to talk to you, but I want to, that

10
11

that would be using those words.
MR. RESTUCCIA:

But that would be --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. RESTUCCIA:

14
15

So how can you say --

That would be an express

waiver, though.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How can you say that

16

an appeal to someone's religious position after 2 and

17

a quarter hours is a voluntary waiver?

18

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, if you look at what

19

this Court has provided in terms of guidance regarding

20

what constitutes a lengthy interrogation, Miranda notes

21

that a lengthy interrogation would be strong evidence

22

against there being a valid waiver.

23

this Court has determined to be a lengthy interrogation

24

25

Miranda even talks about -8

But what

In fact,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We didn't say -- we don't

2

have any decision that says the police are home free for

3

4

lengthy interrogation.

You said that that this was not

5

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Right.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we -- we have no

7

decision that says that the police, faced with a silent

8

suspect, goes after that suspect, questioning him

9

incessantly for 2 and -- 2 hours and 15 minutes, that

10
11

that is not lengthy.
MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, I think it's important

12

to remember that the factual record here was established

13

by the State court, and the factual record isn't that he

14

remained absolutely silent, but that he participated --

15
16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He said "yeah," "no," and

"I don't know."
MR. RESTUCCIA:

Right.

But he was

There's a fundamental difference between

case that says that 2 and a quarter hours is too long?

MR. RESTUCCIA:

No, there's no case law to

that effect.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And, therefore, there's no

3

clearly established Supreme Court law that 2 and a

4

quarter hours is too long.

5

MR. RESTUCCIA:

That's the position that --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that the name of the

7

game here?

8

MR. RESTUCCIA:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's the position -Is there a clearly

10

established rule that in all of the circumstances of the

11

case, we can find that there is coercion, time being one

12

aspect of those circumstances?

13
14

MR. RESTUCCIA:

I think that's right.

And

what -- one of the --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so that is a clearly

16

established rule, and then it's a question whether 2 and

17

a half, 3 and a half, 4 and a half suffices.

18

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Right.

-

The -- the case that

19

I cited was Frazier v. Cupp, in which the interview

20

started at 5:00 p.m. and it finished at 6:45 p.m., and

21

the Court called that an interrogation of short

22

duration.

23

Court has stated expressly in Davis that once you have

24

knowingly received your rights, that the knowing

25

reception itself dispels the inherently coercive

And it is important to remember that this

aspect --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The question --

But your -- your position

4

is that if -- same facts, but it's 10 hours instead of

5

2 and a half, is that a closer case, at least?

6

MR. RESTUCCIA:

For --

That's a very different

7

case, because there is case law -- like I cited Blackburn

8

was an interview that ran 8 or 9 hours, and this Court

9

found that that person was probably incompetent or

10

insane.

11

about that kind of long duration, whereas in our --

But that duration is -- there's been guidance

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And does that show that ­

13

that the circumstances are coercive, so that even if there

14

were a waiver it would be --

15

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Right.

That's the

16

suggestion from Miranda, that a lengthy interrogation

17

preceding the waiver can suggest the waiver was not

18

valid.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

The question, of

20

course, is not whether we think 2 and a quarter hours

21

under all the circumstances is -- is too long under our

22

precedent.

23

unreasonable for the State court to determine otherwise.

24
25

The question is, instead, whether it would be

MR. RESTUCCIA:

That's right.

And, ultimately,

the question is what guidance is there to the State of
11

Michigan in applying the implied waiver doctrine to

2

indicate that the implied waiver couldn't come after 2

hours and 15 minutes of interaction in which it

willing participant.

If that's clear

8

him questions and he says nothing, that it has become

9

clear that he has not waived his right?

10

MR. RESTUCCIA:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

The factual record --

For the question is not

this.

The question is whether, after 2 hours and

13

15 minutes of silence, it is clear -- it's nothing about

14

Supreme Court law.

15

cannot question him after he makes clear he hasn't

16

17

reasonable for a State court to say -- after 2 hours and

it reasonable to hold that he has not -- conclude that

20

he has not waived his rights?

Supreme Court law is clear:

MR. RESTUCCIA:

But -- but this language from

18

Miranda that says the silence of the accused after

19

warnings are given would not be sufficient, that's

20

right, but Butler then fully explained.

21

the State courts are coming in that they then -- this

22

Court then made clear that even silence after having

23

received Miranda warnings -- that if you knowingly

24

receive your rights and there is a course of conduct

25

that indicates waiver, that there can be a waiver.
17

And think about

That's exactly what the Federal courts have done on

2

direct review.

3

Now, thinking about the Michigan courts and

4

trying to determine what's -- how these rules are to be

5

applied, the Federal courts have found, in the absence of a

6

waiver, where a suspect knowingly receives his rights

7

and then answers questions implicating himself, that the

8

answers themselves can serve as the basis for the

9

finding of a waiver.

10

That's what the -- the conclusion that Mr.

Thompkins waived here is a reasonable one.

12

objectively unreasonable.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

Respondent's confession was properly

4

admitted at his trial.

I'd like to go right to some

5

of the questions that this Court had about the language

6

that was used in the Miranda decision and in the Butler

7

decision.

8

Butler.

9

the right to silence, but a waiver of the right to

Both -- all of this language comes up in
Now, Butler was a case not about the waiver of

10

counsel.

11

the North Carolina Supreme Court said:

12

know if he waived his right to counsel, and that's why

13

the court got into a question of implied waiver.

14

So the suspect said "I will talk to you," but
Well, we don't

So the Court in its analysis in Butler first

15

reviewed this language that the Court has talked about

16

this morning from Miranda that says "A valid waiver will

17

not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused

18

or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact

19

eventually obtained."

20

And this is our understanding of that language:

21

First, it is not the case that a failure to invoke Miranda

22

rights will be taken in the Miranda context as a waiver.

23

Now, Justice Scalia, I think you

24

alluded to the fact that the normal rule for the Fifth

25

Amendment at trial is that you assert your rights or
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they are waived.

2

that the failure to assert we are not going to take as a

3

waiver.

4

But Miranda's an exception to that,

The government has to do something more.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So do you read -- yes.

5

do you read Miranda as saying that there cannot be

6

questioning unless there is a waiver?

7

on to -- or do you --

8

MS. SAHARSKY:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So

Then we'll go

No.

10

MS. SAHARSKY:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay, you do not.

No.
So are you going to go on --

12

because this is right where you are.

13

to say that, in the Miranda context, the failure to assert

14

can -- can suffice to allow the questioning to proceed?

15

MS. SAHARSKY:

Are you going to go on

As long as the warnings are

16

given, the accused has been told of his rights, and that

17

the police will respect his rights, and questioning can

18

proceed.

19

cases, Moran versus Burbine, that the primary protection

20

afforded by Miranda is to level the playing field by

21

letting the accused know of his rights and that the

22

police will respect them.

23

gets his rights and understands them, the police can

24

question him.

25

there has to be a waiver before any questioning.

The Court said in Davis and said in other

And after the point that he

You'd have to overrule Butler to say that

21
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Just to get back to the second thing that

2

the Court said in Miranda that was picked up in Butler,

3

it said:

4

waiver simply from the fact that a confession was

5

eventually obtained; there is a burden on the

6

government.

7

We are not going to assume that there is a

And the way that we understand that is that

8

the government can't just go into court and say:

9

we have a confession; we know he waived his rights.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Look,

But why isn't that

11

language that you quote a negative inference that there

12

must be a waiver?

13

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, if you look back at the

14

language -- the other language in Miranda, it says that a

15

waiver is a prerequisite to the admission of the

16

evidence at trial.

17

evidence we have to know that he made a knowing and

18

intelligent and voluntary decision to talk.

19

he -- that doesn't mean he has to make the decision to

20

talk right away.

21

police have to say about the benefits of cooperation or

22

the evidence that they have in his case.

23

those are the kinds of things the police could say that

24

could be understood to be custodial interrogation.

25

We know that to be able to use that

But that

He might want to listen to what the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that --

So there's a difference

22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

between waiving at the time of the interrogation and

2

then waiving it at the time of trial?

3

understand that.

4

MS. SAHARSKY:

I'm sorry.

I don't

I didn't mean to

5

suggest that.

What I'm saying is at the time the

6

Respondent makes his statements, that waiver -- there has

7

to be a waiver and it has to be a knowing, intelligent,

8

and voluntary one.

9

That at the time he makes his

10

down, he had to understand what his rights were and

11

there had -- those statements had to not be the result

12

of police coercion.

13

And no court here has found that they were the

14

result of police coercion.

15

voluntariness here.

16

There is no question about

17

Butler to mean about an implied waiver is the fact of a

course of conduct, it talked about the same standard

21

that it's always used in the Miranda context, that came

22

up again recently in this Court's decision in Shatzer,

23

which is that the ultimate question is a knowing,

24

intelligent, and voluntary waiver.

25

When the Court talked about a

It means that at the time the guy

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

But in this case, it was

4

the fact of the concession -- the confession that

5

constituted the waiver.
MS. SAHARSKY:

6

That shows that he decided to

7

talk, but the confession itself isn't enough.

We needed

8

to have -- the State needed to have evidence that he

9

understood his rights, which he said he did, and that there

10

was -- that the confession was not the product of police

11

coercion.

12

And I think that that comes through directly

13

in the language that's at issue in Butler.

14

said "an express written or oral statement of waiver" --

15

to remain silent or the right to counsel -- "is strong proof

16

of the validity of the waiver but not inevitably necessary....

17

The question is not one of form, but whether the

18

defendant, in fact, knowingly and voluntarily waived the

19

rights delineated in Miranda."

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why do you say it would

Alderson Reporting Company

change the police's behavior?

2

know, the -- the NAC -- the Defense Lawyers' brief here is

3

filled with quotations from typical police manuals, and

11

Inbau and Reid and, you

That seems to be what police today are

It says you cannot question people until he
indicates after the warning is given a willingness to
answer questions.

That's the police manual.

So why do you say this would extract a price

12

on law enforcement when the typical police manuals seem

13

to say what the Petitioner here is saying?

14

MS. SAHARSKY:

JUSTICE BREYER:

That

brief itself cites many examples going both ways.
It is often the case, and it is often the

19

case in Federal law enforcement, that the police try to

20

seek a waiver immediately after giving rights because we

21

want to avoid the problems of proof that come up at

22

trial if we don't have a written waiver.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which -- which are the

24

police manuals that go your way?

25

at those, too.

Because I want to look

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

MS. SAHARSKY:

1

I'm sorry, I don't -- I don't

2

have the specific citations from the brief.

I -- I know

3

from asking the Federal law enforcement agencies -- DHS,

4

the FBI, and the DEA -- that the DEA does not invariably

5

seek a waiver and that we don't understand that we need

6

to get an immediate waiver.
And, again, that was what Justice Brennan

7
8

said in -- in dissent in Butler, is that the police should have

9

to seek an immediate waiver.

And the Court said, no,

10

the Fifth Amendment right is -- compel -- about compelled

11

statements being introduced at trial.

12

this protection, that the police have to seek an immediate

13

waiver.

14

would essentially take any burden off the suspect to

15

invoke his rights.

We don't need

In fact, if you adopted a rule like that, it

He wouldn't need to invoke his rights,

16
17

because the police would just -- if the police didn't

18

seek a waiver.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Well, you're saying

20

there -- there's a difference, I -- I assume, between

21

not waiving and positively asserting your right not to

22

be interrogated?
MS. SAHARSKY:

23
24
25

That's exactly right.

If the

person -JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, if -- if he had -- here

2

right?

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right.
Which would have -- which

5

would been the -- the waiver.

6

it's his later behavior that -- that showed that, in

7

fact, he waived.

13

to terminate the whole thing by asserting his right.

15

police can continue to try to obtain a statement from

him?

17

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

at be introduced at trial, it must be the case that he

2

decided he was going to talk to the police knowingly,

3

intelligently, and voluntarily.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

As I read

5

this transcript, the police's tactic, by their own

6

statement, was to approach him and say:

7

evidence.

8

the officer used -- but he's entitled to an alternative

9

explanation.

10

This is our

Explain yourself -- that's the words

Tell us.
What's clear is that at no point did he

11

answer those questions, because nothing about the nods

12

of the head or anything else showed a willingness to

13

confess.

14

And even in the responses he gave, he

15

answered a series of questions with a "yes," but not with

16

an explanation, which was what was being requested.

17

So my question is, how does one infer a

18

voluntary statement from a situation in which someone's

19

really not talking?

20

a nod to questions that don't -- that's what the circuit

21

said, to questions that we don't know what they were

22

about -- do you want a mint or not, I don't even know

23

about his belief in God.

to talk was a knowing and intelligent and voluntary one.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Unless, I assume, that

coercive, then that -- that -- that last statement would

not -- would not be a voluntary waiver.

What happens when

And I just

MS. JACOBS:

Butler, I think, is an

interesting case, because Butler is mostly aimed at the

10

right to counsel.

11

counsel and the right to remain silent, you have really

12

two different kinds of rights.

13

assertion requirement in the right to counsel.

14

can't exercise that right without getting some help from

15

the police.

16

But the right to remain silent -- we don't

17

require that it be asserted.

18

that presumption remains.

19

And there's an

JUSTICE ALITO:

It is a presumption.

And

Your argument is that you

20

can infer waiver of the right to counsel from conduct,

21

but you can't infer waiver of the right to remain silent

22

from conduct?

23

What's your best authority

for that proposition?

MS. JACOBS:

Let me make sure that I -- that

I said yes to the right thing.

3

You can -- I do -- you can take an implied

4

waiver of the -- of the right to silence.

5

agree with that.

6

cited, and I know that there are three kinds of examples.

7

And I look at the cases that have been

One is the person walks into the police

8

Station, and he says I want to confess.

9

voluntary confession.

10

I -- I do

anything.

11

That's a

You don't have to assert

He's -- he's going to confess.
If you have a steady stream of speech in

12

which he says, I don't want to talk but I'll tell you

13

about this, again, you have somebody acting voluntarily.

14

Someone who says I'll only talk about drugs

15

but I'm not going to talk about murder -- he's implied

16

he's waived his right to that.

17

But in this case, when you look at this

18

case, the key issue really is was it volitional?

19

fact would lead a court to decide that there -- that my

20

client --

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

What

So, basically what you're

22

saying is that if the defendant here had said at the

23

beginning, I don't know whether I -- I want to talk

24

to you or not, but I'm going to listen to your questions

25

and I might answer some and I might answer others -- that
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be a different case?

2
3

MS. JACOBS:

Yes, absolutely.

You have an

implied waiver.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And where is there -- what

5

Supreme Court case establishes the distinction between

6

those two situations clearly?

7

MS. JACOBS:

Well, Davis is a case that

8

talks about the assertion of the right to counsel, but

9

does not apply to the right to remain silent.

So I

10

think as long as you still have the presumption of --

11

the presumption of the privilege against

12

self-incrimination as a presumptive right, the police

13

have to do something to move you off square one in order

14

to make it voluntary.

15

Am I answering your question, Justice Alito?

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

I'm not sure I really

understand.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It depends on what you --

don't agree.

23

Ultimately, if he confesses and hasn't

But if by the "it" you mean to make the

24

continuation of the interrogation voluntary, that's a

25

different question.

And I don't know that our cases
33
Alderson Reporting Company

1

establish that you cannot continue the interrogation

2

until there has been a waiver.

3

MS. JACOBS:

Well, Justice Scalia, I just

4

read you page 475 from Miranda that says the requirement

5

is warnings and waiver, and that's not, as they said, a

6

preliminary ritual.

7

know it's a preliminary -- a plurality --

8
9

That means more.

that -- that there has to be a waiver before the

for a while.

MS. JACOBS:

I'll listen to you guys

What is key, I think, in your

20

-- in your hypothetical and in Justice Alito's

hypothetical, is that you have a defendant that feels

comfortable, that is not being oppressed by this

23

coercive atmosphere.

Yes, the police officer in this

"I think he nodded that he understood."

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. JACOBS:

Justice Scalia, you're correct.

Yes,

So I -- boy, I -- what more

do you need?

You need -I mean, he -- he's

listening when -- when they read it to him.

You are presuming that a

defendant thinks that they've got the kind of power to

14

look at a police officer and say, "I don't want to talk

15

to you.

16

Remove me."
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe -- maybe he doesn't

17

want to talk for the moment, but he does want to listen.

18

I'm not sure you're doing defendants a great -- a great

19

favor.

20

to the police telling them, you know, by the way, your

21

co-conspirator is singing like a bird and he's trying to

22

pin it all on you, and maybe, you know, if -- if you

23

don't want to get left holding the bag, maybe you'd better

24

to talk to us and tell us what really happened.

I mean, some of them might want to listen to --

I'm not sure that -- that if I were there,
39

even if I didn't want to talk right now, I might still

2

want to listen, which is apparently what this -- what

3

this person did.

I don't want talk.

the extent that he was told he had right to remain

silent and he didn't say, I'm not going to talk to you.
MS. JACOBS:

There's no clearly established

law that says that he has to assert his right to remain

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it there any

clearly established law the other way, which is the
40

pertinent question?

2

MS. JACOBS:

I think that because there is

3

the presumption of the -- the privilege is a presumptive

4

right, that he does not have to assert it.

5

this is -- the right, or the privilege against

self-incrimination, the constitutional command, is the

7

one right that really defines our criminal justice

system.

This is --

It means that you cannot talk to -- the police

10

makes us an accusatorial system --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

We're not talking

12

-- we're not talking about the Fifth Amendment right.

13

We're talking about the Miranda warnings.

issue of voluntariness in this case.

The suggestion is that they may have

MS. JACOBS:

Right.

That's correct.

But if

21

you are going to adopt the suggestion of the government

22

that you do pre-interrogation waiver, which I think is

23

what we're talking about -- that is, you don't give him

24

his rights and then you can just talk and talk

25

until you are blue in the face, that that ends up being
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a more coercive situation than we have now.

2

This is the kind of situation that could

3

have been easily resolved just by the officer asking Mr.

4

Thompkins, do you want to talk to us?

5

they establish --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if he said, do

you want to remain silent?

MS. JACOBS:

Instead, once

He could -- that's fine.
And he doesn't

answer either one.

11

MS. JACOBS:

14

Because the police --

15

Then -- then he's not

He's not waiving his rights.

It's not

Take him back to the cell, that's it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then you're saying then

16

that the defendant has to -- never has to invoke his

17

right?

18

That -MS. JACOBS:

The state of the -- the state

19

of the law is a defendant does not have to invoke his

20

right to remain silent.

21

it applies to the second stage of -- of the

22

interrogation.

23

Davis is the invocation case;

And it has to do with --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was the Miranda warning

24

adequate in this case?

He got the four warnings, but

25

then, unlike some police forms that then ask the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defendant, do you waive your rights, this form never

2

asked, did you waive your rights?

3

acknowledge that we have informed you of your rights?

4

MS. JACOBS:

It just said:

Do you

That's correct, Justice

5

Ginsburg.

6

officer said is once Mr. Thompkins would not sign it, he

7

then moved into interview mode.

8

further -- if this was an ambiguous act to him, then the

9

officer should have asked a clarifying question.

10

That's all that form said.

And what the

There was no

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say you don't

11

have to invoke your rights, but Butler also says that

12

you can impliedly waive them.

13

expressly waive them.

14

MS. JACOBS:

You don't have to

I'm saying you don't have to

15

invoke the right to remain silent, that that's not the

16

state of the law, that only the right to remain -- I'm

17

sorry -- the right to counsel must be invoked.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

So the

19

question under AEDPA -- you agree there can be an implied

20

waiver; that's what Butler says, right?

21

under AEDPA is whether the State court was unreasonable

22

to determine that there was an implied waiver on these

23

facts?

24
25

MS. JACOBS:

So the question

The State actually found two --

I think you're saying that there was an objectively
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unreasonable determination of the facts in this case?

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

MS. JACOBS:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MS. JACOBS:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MS. JACOBS:

Yes.

And I think that -Maybe.

It's one way or the other.
Right.

And I think clearly that there

8

-- that there were facts that the Michigan Court of

9

Appeals found that were not supported by the record and

10

were objectively unreasonable.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MS. JACOBS:

What are those?

The Sixth Circuit found that

13

when the Michigan Court of Appeals said the defendant

14

continued to talk with officers, the Sixth Circuit said

15

that that was an objectively unreasonable finding

16

because there was no continuation, there was no talking.

17

They also found unreasonable that the defendant talked

18

with officers sporadically.

19

that was a misrepresentation of the record.

20

The Sixth Circuit said that

The last fact that they talked about is the

21

Michigan Court of Appeals said that the defendant made

22

eye contact several times or a number of times.

23

Sixth Circuit said, quote -- this is what the -- they

24

said that that was incorrect.

25

the hearing is that eye contact came only at the end,

And the

What the officer said at

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

one of the very -- one of the very first times came only

2

at the end.

3

So -- but those are important facts.

The

4

fact that he was not continuing to talk -- he wasn't

5

talking at all.

6

voluntariness, that the rights are waived --

7

How do you find this -- this

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, those facts are

8

relevant only if we accept your -- your principal assertion,

9

which is that you -- you don't have to invoke the right and

10

interrogation must cease immediately.

11

that, then all of these facts become relevant.

12

we think that, until you invoke the right, the police can

13

continue to ask you questions and it's up to you to

14

answer or not, then those facts are really not relevant

15

at all, are they?

16

I think that's true.

17

MS. JACOBS:

18

23
24
25

I don't want to say it's true

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It wasn't meant to be a

trick question.
MS. JACOBS:

21
22

But if

--

19
20

If we agree with

-- just because you are asking

it.
If you invoke those -- if you invoke -- if
you hold that he has to invoke those rights.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

On your theory, those --

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

those factual things are irrelevant, whether -MS. JACOBS:

Well, my theory is that you

don't get past the failure to get the waiver.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly, exactly.

5

MS. JACOBS:

6

Returning now to -- to the idea of the

Yes.

7

pre-interrogation waiver, I would suggest to the Court

8

that that would return this -- this Court back to the

9

kind of test that Miranda stopped, which was the

10

applying the totality of the circumstances test, and

11

that you would then, again, revert to pre-Miranda law,

12

where -- and this I believe is what the Wayne County

13

prosecutor amicus wants to do, is just apply totality of

14

the -- the circumstances test to whether in fact someone

15

has waived their rights.

16

Miranda has not been a failure, that this bright-line rule --

17

you give the rights, you get the waiver, then can you talk --

18

that that's --

19

And I would suggest to you that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I must say I've never

20

understood that to be the law, and I don't think it's

21

generally understood to be the law, that unless you get

22

a waiver right at the outset, you have to -- you have to

23

terminate interrogation.

24

police departments that don't -- I've never understood

25

that to be the rule.

I think there are a lot of

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. JACOBS:

Justice Scalia, the opposite of

2

that then becomes the ability to keep the defendant in a

3

room, and the longer --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not saying it isn't a

5

good rule.

6

is whether it is so clearly established that it was

7

unreasonable for the State court to think otherwise.

8
9

It may be a good rule.

MS. JACOBS:

But the issue here

And we would just suggest that

the State court applied Moseley incorrectly and applied

10

Miranda, that those are the clearly established law

11

in that case.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I like clear rules.

Your

13

rule is a clear one.

14

the opposite of yours; that is, that interrogation can

15

continue unless he asserts his right.

16

clear rule.

17

Another clear one would be just

That's another

We can go either way, and it will be clear.
MS. JACOBS:

But if interrogation continues,

18

the longer it continues the less likely that the

19

statement that is taken is going to be the product of my

20

client's free will.

21

an even greater burden in trying to prove that this

22

statement was voluntary or that the waiver of rights is

23

voluntary.

24
25

So the government is going to have

MS. JACOBS:

And all they had to say -- I've

12

got to take the flip side -- is -- and because it's their

house, because if they don't want to create the

14

ambiguity, they are the ones that have to say:

They don't even have to ask him to sign the

17

waiver, although I think the waiver is proof positive.

18

Once he signs the waiver, you know, I haven't got much

19

to argue in terms of the admissibility of the

20

confession.

according to Miranda, that ambiguity is resolved against

them.

requirements.

MS. JACOBS:

You say

If you find that the officer

does not have to ask the question, does not have to

10

clarify whether in fact the defendant is remaining

11

silent, then I do have to talk to the rest to try and

12

persuade you that in those 2 hours and 45 minutes he was

13

not being cooperative, he was not willingly entering

14

into --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That issue is not in

this case, though.

MS. JACOBS:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -As I understand it,

not renewed that, correct?

voluntariness in my brief to this Court.

I mean,

that's -- I don't want to piggyback off

11

Justice Kennedy's point, but that's the whole point, is

12

you do not look at any of those circumstances, you say.

13

Before they can say anything more, they have to get a

14

waiver.

15

they -- if they sit there for how long before -- how

16

long do they have to ask, do you want to waive?

So it's 30 seconds if they go on, before

MS. JACOBS:

If -- if you were going to go

19

an implied waiver, you -- you are interested in looking at

20

what happened in this case to decide whether, in fact,

21

the "yes" answers were an implied waiver.

22

I'm arguing about the circumstances, that there's

23

nothing in these circumstances that could lead you to

believe that after 2 hours and 45 minutes, there was a

voluntary waiver, the implied waiver.

16

The police cannot interrogate the

cannot ensue, because then the rest of the questioning

becomes trying to talk the defendant into waiving the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So what --

what is an implied waiver case?
MS. JACOBS:

Well, it's -- the implied
54

1

waiver case is North Carolina v. Butler.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's right.

3

Now, getting back to Ms. Saharsky's point, she said if you

4

prevail, you have to overrule Butler.

5

me that that's the point we're at.

6

MS. JACOBS:

And it seems to

But Butler -- I don't think you

7

have to overrule Butler, because Butler really was a

8

right to counsel case.

It did talk about the right to

10

fact that this gentleman did not waive the right to

11

counsel.

12
13

So, I don't think you have to.

I think you

can still have implied waivers.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, there's --

15

so, there's no implied waiver with respect to the right

16

to remain silent?

17

MS. JACOBS:

That's a hard question, and I

18

don't have -- I don't have an easy answer or a hard

19

answer for you.

20

think that you want to hog-tie the police.

21

that.

22

defendant, but there's got -- but it's got to be

23

voluntary, and that in order to do that, you really have

24

to get a waiver.

25

I -- I don't think that -- I don't
I agree with

I think that the police should be able to talk to a

U.S. v. Cardwell I think is an implied
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

waiver where the defendant starts to talk to the officer

2

there -- they're in a police car, and the defendant

3

starts to talk to the officer after an hour and a half

4

of silence, although that, again, isn't a custodial

5

situation, but the police found -- but the court found

6

that that was, in fact, a waiver.

9

So if there are no further questions, I'll
cede my time.

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

10

Mr. Restuccia, you have 4 minutes remaining.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I have to say that --

12

page 475 and 476, particularly, of Miranda do talk in

13

terms of a -- of a waiver.

14

subsequent cases indicate an articulation of that view

15

that's closer to your position?

Did -- are there -- did the

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. RESTUCCIA:

page 14 of the -- of the reply brief, the yellow brief,

21

and the quote from Miranda talking about the processes is,

22

on page 14, "Once warnings have been given, the

23

Well, I think Miranda itself

Miranda's description of the processes:

question.

It's a block quote from Miranda.

This is

"Once warnings
If

The --

Well, why doesn't it -But I don't think that was the

The question, at least as I understood it, is

10

that Miranda says you cannot admit a confession into

11

evidence unless he has first waived it.

12

MR. RESTUCCIA:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.
Then it says, clearly, that

14

even if the police and the prosecution testify he did

15

waive it, even if they say he did, explicitly, still, if

16

there's a long questioning, even then, the court should

17

be very careful about admitting it.

18

MR. RESTUCCIA:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

But then --

And doesn't it flow from

20

that a fortiori that if he doesn't admit it and all there

21

is, is the long questioning that, there has been no

22

waiver?

23
24
25

MR. RESTUCCIA:

But here Mr. Thompkins

answered a series of questions knowing -JUSTICE BREYER:

He answered three

57

questions.

2

MR. RESTUCCIA:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

believe in God?

Right.
All right.

One, do you

Yes.

5

Two, do you pray to God?

6

Three, have you asked God for forgiveness

7

for shooting the boy?

Yes.

Yes.

8

Okay.

So, where -- where did he waive it?

9

MR. RESTUCCIA:

He -- that's what the

10

Federal courts have done on direct review -- this is what

11

Cardwell did, and there are five or six circuits have

12

found the answers to the questions themselves can be the

13

best --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, in this case, after 2

15

hours and 15 minutes when he gave the answers I just

16

said, when did he waive his Miranda rights?

17
18
19
20

MR. RESTUCCIA:

When he answered those

questions, because the -JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I think any then -- then

Miranda is --

21

MR. RESTUCCIA:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, because -It says you can't admit the stuff

23

after a long questioning unless he waives.

24

something or there would be nothing to admit.

25

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Obviously, he says

The -- that's what the

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Federal courts have done in applying Butler, because the

2

words and actions of the person interrogated can give

3

rise to the inference that the person has waived.

4

the person has taken action that's inconsistent with the

5

exercise of his rights, it is proper to find waiver.

6

The -- this --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Where

May I ask, can you go back

8

to page 14 in your reply brief?

"Once warnings have

9

been given, the subsequent procedure is clear.

If the

10

individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to

11

or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent,

12

the interrogation must cease."

13

MR. RESTUCCIA:

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.
So the question is whether

15

during those two hours by not answering a -- a number of

16

questions, did he indicate in any way that he wished to

17

remain silent?

18

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Right.

That this -- so if

19

you look at the implication analysis, did he make it clear

20

that I don't want to participate in this interrogation?

21

Detective Helgert's testimony --

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then it says that any -- in

23

any manner that he wished to remain silent.

24

the 2 hours and a half later when he did answer the

25

three questions, that's pretty -- it's at least arguable
59
Alderson Reporting Company

And until

Official

1

that his silence indicated he wished to remain silent.

2

MR. RESTUCCIA:

Well, what happens, though,

3

in Davis, this Court made clear for the purpose of

4

invocation, that the invocation has to be unambiguous

5

because the police have to know when they have to cut

6

off their questioning.

7

it's ultimately, for the question of invocation, his

8

burden to assert the right to take an affirmative action

9

to show, I don't want to answer any questions.

10

The -- so, if it's ambiguous,

Detective Helgert believed, through his

11

limited responses, the give and take of part of this

12

interview, that he was a willing participant in the

13

interview.

14

established by the State courts.

15

remember that this case being reviewed in habeas that
