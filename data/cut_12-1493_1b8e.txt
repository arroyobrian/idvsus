 (11:06 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

next in Case 121493, Abramski v. United States. 

5

 Mr. Dietz? 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD R. DIETZ 

7
8
9

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. DIETZ: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

10

 In 2009, Bruce Abramski went to a gun store 

11

at his home in Virginia and purchased a firearm.  When 

12

he did so, he filled out all the required Federal 

13

paperwork providing his own name and identifying 

14

information and passing a background check. 

15

 He then traveled to his uncle's home in 

16

Pennsylvania and delivered the firearm to a licensed gun 

17

dealer there.  That gun dealer required Mr. Abramski's 

18

uncle to fill out the exact same Federal paperwork and 

19

pass his own background check before taking possession 

20

of the firearm. 

21

 But despite doing precisely what Congress 

22

established as the process to buy a firearm, intending 

23

to sell or give it to a lawful gun owner in another 

24

State, the government charged Mr. Abramski with falsely 

25

stating that he was the actual buyer of the firearm when

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

he acquired it. 

2

 And that term, "actual" 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What would happen if two 

4

people walk into the gun store, one person hands the 

5

money to the other and says, buy me that gun? 

6

 MR. DIETZ: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8
9

Yes, Your Honor. 
Is that not actionable, 

according to your theory? 
 MR. DIETZ: 

Your Honor, the circumstance 

10

where there are two lawful gun owners, that is 

11

permissible.  And I think a good way to illustrate that 

12

is to consider the government's concession that in that 

13

hypothetical, if the two people walked into the gun 

14

store and the person looked and said, I'd like that gun 

15

and points to the counter and then the person 

16

standing 

17
18
19
20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What's  what's 

truthful about saying you're the buyer 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Please finish what you were 

saying.  I  I didn't understand what your point was. 

21

 MR. DIETZ: 

22

 In that circumstance, if the person standing 

23

at the counter then says, I'd like to buy that firearm, 

24

that the person indicated, I'm going to give it to that 

25

person, then even the government concedes that in that

Yes, Your Honor. 

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

circumstance, everything about that sale is perfectly 

2

lawful and the buyer can take the gun, hand it to that 

3

person standing next to them, who would leave the gun 

4

store with the gun dealer and the government having 

5

absolutely no idea who that person is or where the gun 

6

is going. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm sorry.  So you're saying 

8

that in that case, the gun dealer runs the background 

9

check on the person who hands the gun dealer the credit 

10

card as opposed to the person who will be the actual 

11

recipient of the gun?  Is that what you're saying the 

12

statute requires? 

13

 MR. DIETZ: 

That's correct, Your Honor.  I 

14

think the government concedes that as well in gift 

15

circumstance at least, and there's certainly nothing in 

16

the Gun Control Act that suggests that Congress was 

17

distinguishing between those two circumstances at all. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, in the gift  in the 

19

gift situation.  But Congress requires certain 

20

information from the buyer, whatever that means; right? 

21

 MR. DIETZ: 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

23

Yes, Your Honor. 
The  the dealer has to 

record the name of the buyer; right? 

24

 MR. DIETZ: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
And the address of the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

buyer? 

2

 MR. DIETZ: 

3

JUSTICE ALITO: 

4

Yes, sir. 

And do an instant check on 


the buyer? 

5

MR. DIETZ: 

6

JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

Now, why would  why would this 


7

Congress have wanted those things with respect to the 

8

person who was just the straw purchaser and not the 

9

person who  the person who's actually going to acquire the 

10
11

weapon? 
 MR. DIETZ: 

The reason, Your Honor, is that 

12

this legislation, the way Congress designed it, is not 

13

focused on sort of the end point.  It's not concerned 

14

about where a gun is actually going, who's ultimately 

15

going to receive it. 

16

 What Congress was concerned about was the 

17

starting point because, as part of the key political 

18

compromise of the Gun Control Act, there were two 

19

competing interests that needed to be accommodated. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why wouldn't they be 

21

concerned about the starting point?  Let's say there's a 

22

man, Mr. Straw, and he holds himself out as a gun buyer, he 

23

puts  you know, a website, he creates a website.  He puts 

24

something in the Yellow Pages under "Straw Man."  And he 

25

says:  You want to acquire a gun and you don't want the

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dealer to record your name and you don't want to have an 

2

instant check on you, you come to me. 

3

 And so these people come to him, and 

4

whenever they do, he goes to Joe's gun shop and  with 

5

the other person.  He says, I want to buy a gun, but 

6

this fellow with me is going to do all the talking.  So 

7

the guy who's with him talks with Joe about different 

8

types of guns, costs and everything. 

9

 After that's done, the person who's done all 

10

the talking says, now, my friend, Mr. Straw, is going to 

11

buy this gun.  He gives Mr. Straw the money, Mr. Straw 

12

buys the gun, and the dealer writes down Mr. Straw's 

13

name for the fifteenth time that month, his address, 

14

does another instant check on it. 

15

 What sense does that make. 

16

 MR. DIETZ: 

Your Honor, I think, to your 

17

first point about why, why starting points, the reason 

18

is because all that Congress wanted is to provide law 

19

enforcement with a way to trace the firearm. 

20

 If you have truthful, accurate information 

21

about the first initial purchaser, the person who walks 

22

out of a gun store with a gun in their hand, then law 

23

enforcement has that starting point if they need to 

24

trace the firearm. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I suppose  I suppose that

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

your answer to what sense it makes is that was the 

2

compromise, that there was strong opposition to any gun 

3

control law, and the condition was you get the buyer, 

4

and you don't make the buyer promise not to give it to 

5

somebody else. 

6

 He could immediately give it to somebody 

7

who's unqualified to own the gun, couldn't he?  Would 

8

that be a violation? 

9

 MR. DIETZ: 

Your Honor, that would  that 

10

would violate other laws because Congress, in the 

11

Firearm Owners Protection Act, clarified that  or 

12

amended the provision to provide that a private citizen 

13

who transfers a firearm to someone they know or have 

14

reasonable cause to believe is prohibited, that's a 

15

crime. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about somebody 

17

somebody who is qualified to own a firearm?  Can I take 

18

a firearm that I own and say  you know, it's yours? 

19

 MR. DIETZ: 

Yes, Your Honor, and I think the 

20

government has conceded that if it's someone in your own 

21

State, there's 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Don't have to register it? 

23

I don't have to go through a firearm dealer, right? 

24

It's my gun, and I can give it to somebody else who's 

25

qualified.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DIETZ: 

That's correct, Your Honor.  And 

2

in cases like Mr. Abramski's case, where his uncle lived 

3

in another State, Congress provided a path for those 

4

people as well, and that is they have to deliver the 

5

firearm to another dealer in that State before finishing 

6

the transfer. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you're never going to 

8

know who the end user is once the gun is sold, whether 

9

you take the  you know, the straw buyer's name or 

10

the  or the other person's name or both.  You don't 

11

know where the gun is going to end up, do you? 

12

 MR. DIETZ: 

Yes, sir.  That's right, Your 

13

Honor.  And that's because that  that was the key 

14

compromise 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Language matters in a 

16

statute.  I mean, I do believe that.  And here, the 

17

relevant language seems to me  what is material to the 

18

government says  is the statute about selling or 

19

delivering? 

20

 Now, did this person  was he the buyer, 

21

your client?  Was he somebody that they sold or 

22

delivered it to?  Well, he's a straw.  A straw purchaser 

23

is someone who doesn't purchase. 

24
25

 The person who purchases is the person who 
uses the straw.  Now, you can't say that about a giver,

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a benefactor is  the person who's the beneficiary of 

2

the benefactor is not the purchaser.  But the straw 

3

purchaser is not the purchaser. 

4

 And it comes from "straw bail," where 

5

someone else put up the bail, and it was called straw 

6

because the people who made a career of that used to 

7

wear straw in their shoes.  Interesting. 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10

of this case, the straw 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 (Laughter.) 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

He made that up. 

No, I didn't.  I thought it 

came from the Wizard of Oz, but it doesn't 

15

17

But in terms of  in terms 

The fact is that is where 

it comes from. 
 I think, in every legal context, it means 

19

someone who is not the real.  So who is the real?  In 

20

this case, it is the person for whom the straw 

21

purchased. 

22

 So we fit that within the language. 

We 

23

can't fit the beneficiary of a gift within the language 

24

and that's the reason for the distinction, and so why 

25

not do it that way?

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DIETZ: 

With respect, Your Honor, I 

2

think that the principle you described of a straw man or 

3

straw purchases in the context  historical context you 

4

described it, I don't believe is a criminal context. 

5

 We've not been able to find any case in 

6

which the criminal law has ever recognized that sort of 

7

civil agency law principle, that when there is a 

8

principalagent relationship, this fiduciary duty, 

9

that because the principal controls the agent or the 

10

straw man, that everything that the agent does is really 

11

an act of the principal. 

12

 And Congress  there were historically 

13

criminal common law principles of agency. And  Congress 

14

codified those principles in Title 18, United States 

15

Code, Section 2.  Those are things like aiding and 

16

abetting, principals and accessories. 

17
18
19

 That's not the principle on which the 
government relies today.  The government 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You still have not explained 

20

what purpose is served by obtaining the name of the 

21

straw purchaser and doing an instant check on the straw 

22

purchaser.  You said that it allows the tracing of the 

23

weapon, but that's not going to be true in the case of a 

24

straw purchaser because the person  the straw 

25

purchaser, isn't necessarily and probably in the vast

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

majority of cases isn't going to get the name or any 

2

information about the actual recipient. 

3

 That's the whole purpose of having a straw 

4

purchaser.  So then what purpose is served by this? 

5

It's just meaningless. 

6

 MR. DIETZ: 

With respect, Your Honor, I 

7

disagree.  And I think the reason is again that the 

8

intent of Congress in the Gun Control Act was not to 

9

trace or track where firearms were going.  So in every 

10

case, because private sales have no recordkeeping or 

11

background check requirements, in every case where 

12

there's a trace of a firearm the government has to go 

13

all the way back to the beginning. 

14

 They go to the manufacturer with the serial 

15

number and follow the gun through the stream of commerce 

16

until they find that gun dealer where the gun was first sold, 

17

and then they 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So they find the gun dealer 

19

and the gun dealer says, I sold it to Mr. Straw.  And 

20

then they go to Mr. Straw and Mr. Straw said:  My client 

21

took it.  Okay, who's your client?  I have no idea.  He 

22

came into my store. You know,  He contacted me.  I didn't ask his 

23

name.  He didn't give me his name.  And that's the end 

24

of it. 

25

 So no purpose is served by putting down the

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

name, the address, doing the check on the straw 

2

purchaser. 

3

 MR. DIETZ: 

But, Your Honor, again Congress 

4

understood that that's how the statute worked because, 

5

for example 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what you're saying is 

7

they did a meaningless thing.  That was the compromise. 

8

They would do something that's utterly meaningless. 

9

 MR. DIETZ: 

No, Your Honor.  And the reason 

10

is, consider for example a circumstance where, instead 

11

of buying firearm with intent to resell it, five minutes 

12

after the purchase, walking out of the gun store, a 

13

stranger approaches you and says, that's a nice looking 

14

gun, I'd like to buy it from you. 

15

 It's perfectly legal under the Gun Control 

16

Act to sell the gun to that stranger, who then will 

17

leave and again in the tracing process, the government's 

18

trace will stop with that first purchaser.  And Congress 

19

understood that that's how the process would work and 

20

that was part of the compromise.  What Congress wanted 

21

was accurate information about the initial person who 

22

acquires the firearm so at least they can try to do that 

23

trace. 

24
25

 And Congress understood that in many 
circumstances 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And in some cases, they can 

2

track it all the way.  In this case, unlike the 

3

hypothetical that Justice Alito gave you, if they went 

4

to the straw, to the straw purchaser, he would say, oh, 

5

I actually bought it from my uncle.  And he'd give the 

6

uncle's name, and then the uncle would say  you know, 

7

where else the firearm went from him. 

8
9

 MR. DIETZ: 

Yes, Your Honor.  And, in fact, 

in this case the government received all the 

10

recordkeeping and background check information that they 

11

could possibly have received.  They got full Federal 

12

paperwork from both Mr. Abramski and his uncle and ran a 

13

background check on both. 

14
15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Your position is that this 

is not a material misstatement; is that correct? 

16

 MR. DIETZ: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
Why isn't it material in 

18

light of the fact that it was a question that was on the 

19

government form that was promulgated, that was directed 

20

by regulations? 

21

 MR. DIETZ: 

The reason, Your Honor  I 

22

think this is a critical concession by the government. 

23

It's on pages 35 and 36 of their brief.  The government 

24

acknowledges that the statements on the form are just an 

25

interpretive rule and not even sort of ordinary

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretive rule that this Court may encounter with 

2

agency interpretations where they are looking at the 

3

statute, and although they have not been delegated with 

4

authority to rule make, they are interpreting the text 

5

of the statute.  Here, the government acknowledges that 

6

the statement is an interpretation of the case law about 

7

the straw purchaser doctrine. 

8

 And the problem with that is that there's a 

9

split in the circuits about what that case precedent 

10

should be, and the government's suggesting that this 

11

Court should somehow defer to the statement on the form 

12

that it has the power of law, that people should 

13

acknowledge it. 

14

 But, of course, when you have a case law 

15

question like this where there's a split, this Court is 

16

the authority that decides what the law should be.  And 

17

it's not required to defer at all to the statements on 

18

the form. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dietz, can we go back to 

20

the question that Justice Alito raised?  The primary 

21

object of this statute is to keep guns out of the  hands of 

22

felons, of people with mental illness and so forth. 

23

 Now, it's absolutely true, as you have said, 

24

that Congress didn't do everything it could have to 

25

achieve that result, right?  That there are many kinds

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of resales that are allowable, that there are gifts that 

2

are allowable. 

3

 It's one thing to say that. 

It's another 

4

thing to say that at the initial point of sale, which is 

5

where the entire system is set up, right, with the gun 

6

dealer doing the automatic checks, that at that initial 

7

point of sale, which is the centerpiece of this statute, 

8

that we will  that we will essentially disregard 

9

fronts, that we  you know, that we don't care that the 

10

person standing at the counter is a front. 

11

 I mean, that goes far beyond the other kinds 

12

of resale possibilities that you're talking about.  And 

13

I guess what I want to know is why you think a Congress 

14

that was geared towards this object of keeping guns out 

15

of the hands of dangerous people and set up a mechanism 

16

that had the gun seller be the kind of enforcer, at the 

17

point of sale, would have thought, oh, it's fine if a 

18

front, if a straw walks in the door. 

19

 MR. DIETZ: 

The reason, Your Honor, is 

20

because Congress understood that private sales  that 

21

there was an importance to private sales between 

22

citizens.  And in a straw purchase like this or  or 

23

someone who's purchasing a gun intending to resell it to 

24

someone else, that is precisely what's happening is that 

25

second sale is a private transaction between two private

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

citizens and Congress did not want any regulation of 

2

those types of sales.  And that was part of the 

3

political compromise in the law. 

4

 So yes, Your Honor, I acknowledge that you 

5

could certainly describe this as  as not a 

6

comprehensive regime.  There are holes in the 

7

legislation.  But remember, too, that Congress was not 

8

operating in a vacuum. 

9

 It understood that, although there might not 

10

be a national consensus about some of these issues and, 

11

therefore, the regime that Congress chose may have some 

12

holes in it.  But the States could fill those holes if 

13

there was a Statewide consensus on that issue.  And 

14

many States have done that. 

15

 Some States have  Hawaii, for example 

16

what is really a complete gun registration system.  And 

17

others, like West Virginia, believe that there should be 

18

virtually no regulation of these sorts of private sales 

19

at all. 

20

 And so I think the system is working 

21

precisely as Congress intended.  And if there are 

22

problems, Congress will come back and fix it.  And we've 

23

seen, for example, in the Firearm Owners Protection Act 

24

and in the Brady Act that  this is an area where 

25

Congress is continuing to observe what's going on in the

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

nation and making changes to the law as necessary. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

In  in the 

3

situation that Justice Alito hypothesized of the person 

4

who's doing this several times a month and has the ad in 

5

the Yellow Pages, is that  is that person subject to 

6

regulation as a dealer? 

7

 MR. DIETZ: 

Yes, Your Honor.  I wanted to 

8

make that point.  And that is that, of course, if you 

9

engage in the business of purchasing firearms to sell to 

10

others, then you will at some point be subject to the 

11

licensing requirements that Congress created. 

12

 So, again, this is not a system that has 

13

some obvious loophole where people can begin to engage 

14

in their own sort of sale of guns to others.  This is a 

15

situation where Congress wanted to leave open the option 

16

for private citizens, like Mr. Abramski, to purchase 

17

guns for other lawful gun owners like family members, 

18

neighbors and friends 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But this  this family 

20

member, the uncle, residing in Pennsylvania, he could 

21

not have purchased that gun in Virginia, isn't that 

22

right, because he's a nonresident? 

23

 MR. DIETZ: 

With respect, Your Honor, I 

24

disagree.  It's true that he could not have walked into 

25

the gun store and left the gun store in Virginia with 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with the gun.  But he could have purchased it there. 

2

 Congress created a means in the statute for 

3

the gun to then be shipped to a gun dealer in 

4

Pennsylvania, and he would have to pick up the gun and 

5

again fill out the Federal forms and undergo a 

6

background check at that gun dealer in his home in 

7

Pennsylvania. 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But wouldn't he 

wouldn't he have to comply with the 552(c), which says 

10

how somebody who doesn't show up in person can purchase 

11

a gun?  And none of those requirements were satisfied 

12

here.  So it seems to me that what you're asking is just 

13

an end run around what Congress said.  If you're out of 

14

State and you want to buy it, this is how you have to do 

15

it. 

16

 MR. DIETZ: 

With respect, Your Honor, I 

17

don't think that's what Congress meant in Section 

18

922(c), which is the provision that deals with absent 

19

buyers.  And the concern there was Congress wanted to 

20

leave open two paths for gun buyers. 

21

 One is to physically be present at the gun 

22

store and fill out the papers yourself for the gun 

23

dealer.  As you're writing your name and age and your 

24

height and eye color on the forms, there's a person 

25

there looking at you.

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And there was also an option that Congress 

2

provided for people to purchase a gun, for example, by 

3

telephone or mail or over the Internet without ever 

4

actually being present, with no person being present in 

5

the gun store. 

6

 And it was in that circumstance that 

7

Congress said we think we need a little bit more 

8

recordkeeping in those cases.  So that's why they 

9

required the affidavit, for example, and the  the 

10

waiting period to provide extra time for local law 

11

enforcement and the background check. 

12

 But that's not the situation here. 

13

Mr. Abramski was physically present at the gun store and 

14

so that provision of the statute is not even implicated 

15

here. 

16

 Another point, Your Honors, is that the 

17

plain text interpretation of the statute is one that the 

18

agency, ATF, had adopted initially.  In 1979, the Agency 

19

sent a circular to gun dealers that took the  the 

20

precise position that  that Petitioner is taking here, 

21

which is that a purchase of a gun for another lawful gun 

22

owner is permissible. 

23

 And in doing so, the  the Agency said that 

24

that was an interpretation of the text of the Gun 

25

Control Act.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What is the government's 

2

I guess I should ask the government, but does the 

3

government contend that there are two buyers now? 

4

Both  is the real buyer the person who sends in the 

5

straw man so that it's only his information that you 

6

have to give?  Or are there two buyers? 

7

 MR. DIETZ: 

Your Honor, I don't know the 

8

government's position, but our position is that there's 

9

one buyer, and that's the person who's actually paying 

10

for the gun, filling out the forms, undergoing a 

11

background check, and leaving the gun  leaving the gun 

12

store with the gun in their hand. 

13

 And Congress didn't use terms like "true 

14

buyer" or "true purchaser" or "actual buyer" because 

15

they are not concerned about the ultimate recipients of 

16

firearms or what happens to a gun after it leaves the 

17

gun store. 

18

 The focus of the Gun Control Act is on that 

19

initial purchase and making sure that that purchase 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What  what position 

21

are you taking here?  Are you arguing that it doesn't 

22

matter whether it's a straw purchaser or not; a buyer is 

23

a buyer is a buyer?  It's the person who puts the money 

24

down on the counter? 

25

 Or are you arguing, as a  as a backup or

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as your main point  I don't understand  that if it's 

2

a lawful buyer using a straw man, that that's not 

3

actionable? 

4

 MR. DIETZ: 

Yes, Your Honor.  We are 

5

arguing, yes, that the person who pays for the gun, the 

6

person that's there in the gun store, pays for the 

7

firearm is the buyer.  That is the  or the  in fact, 

8

the term "buyer" isn't even used in the Gun Control Act. 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Even if their intent is 

to sell it to a prohibited person? 
 MR. DIETZ: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

12

And  and in those circumstances  again, I think this 

13

is an important point  is that Congress provided a 

14

number of means to prosecute illegal straw purchasers. 

15

And all of those provisions are still available to the 

16

government, even if this Court was to disapprove the 

17

straw purchaser doctrine in all its applications. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If we disagree with you on 

19

the first point about the straw purchaser, would you 

20

would you lose on the grounds that Mr. Abramski's uncle 

21

could not have lawfully purchased the gun at that store 

22

because he wasn't a resident of the State? 

23

 MR. DIETZ: 

No, Your Honor.  Two points 

24

there:  First, as I mentioned, it would have been 

25

possible for Mr. Abramski's uncle to purchase the gun in

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Virginia.  He could have gone to that gun store and 

2

said, this is the gun I want and paid the money.  He 

3

would have had to go back  the gun would have had to 

4

have been shipped to Pennsylvania, and he would have had 

5

to take possession of it in Pennsylvania after filling 

6

out additional paperwork and 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But he couldn't have taken 

possession of it in  in Pennsylvania. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

11

 MR. DIETZ: 

In Virginia. 
In Virginia. 
That's correct, Your Honor. 

12

But, again, I don't think that that changes the 

13

materiality analysis, because, again, the question is 

14

not whether Mr. Abramski's uncle could have picked up or 

15

bought the gun in Virginia. 

16

 The question is, if Mr. Abramski had told 

17

the gun dealer the truth, that yes, I plan to buy this 

18

gun, but I'm going to take it up to Pennsylvania and 

19

give it to my uncle after I deliver it to a gun dealer 

20

there, the way that Congress wrote the Gun Control Act, 

21

the gun dealer still could have sold the gun to 

22

Mr. Abramski.  And that's why 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But would it have been a 

24

lawful sale if the gun had been delivered to him on the 

25

spot?

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DIETZ: 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

To Mr. Abramski's uncle? 
Yes.  He could not 

3

Mr. Abramski is out of the picture and the uncle goes 

4

in, buys the gun, puts down a Pennsylvania address.  The 

5

dealer gives him the gun and walks out of the store. 

6

That  would that be a lawful sale? 

7

 MR. DIETZ: 

No, Your Honor.  No. 

8

Mr. Abramski's uncle could not take  could not have 

9

bought the gun in another State and taken possession of 

10

it.  But, again, for the materiality question, the way 

11

this Court has described that standard in Kungys is 

12

whether  if Mr. Abramski had provided the truthful 

13

information, if that would have been capable of 

14

influencing the outcome in that case 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

In describing what 

16

happened here, you  you  you said that Abramski went 

17

in and then went to Pennsylvania and gave the gun to his 

18

uncle.  That's not quite correct.  He  he transferred 

19

it to him for consideration.  I had thought, and this 

20

was  goes back to Justice Scalia's question 

21

question about if there's one buyer here or two. 

22

 I had thought that it might be possible that 

23

you can  to construct a case where Abramski tells his 

24

uncle, I'm going to buy the gun, and then I'm going to 

25

sell it to you, and I'm going to sell it to you in

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Pennsylvania at a gun dealer's store so we can fill out 

2

the necessary forms.  Would the government then have 

3

objected to what happened here? 

4

 MR. DIETZ: 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

6

Your Honor 

government 

7

 MR. DIETZ: 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9
10

I mean, we can ask the 

Yes. 
 as Justice Scalia 

indicates, but under  as you understand their case. 
 MR. DIETZ: 

Yes, Your Honor.  I think the 

11

reason is that the government's position is that you 

12

cannot buy a gun intending to sell it to another lawful 

13

gun owner.  That is the government's position. 

14

 But just one point of clarification is, to 

15

the extent it's relevant, Mr. Abramski did not receive 

16

consideration for the purchase of the firearm.  The 

17

record indicates that his uncle sent him a check to 

18

cover the cost of the gun.  This was, in all respects, 

19

someone doing a favor for a family member. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Could  could you address 

21

the other  the other point here, which is the one I 

22

have more trouble with, to tell you the truth, Count 2? 

23

 MR. DIETZ: 

Yes, Your Honor.  That count 

24

the language  that Congress chose  was that one cannot "make a 

25

false statement about information required by this

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

chapter to be kept," "this chapter" meaning chapter 44, 

2

the Gun Control Act itself.  And the Gun Control Act 

3

contains  it actually references a provision, and 

4

that's 922(b)(5), where Congress says this is the 

5

information that uses that term, "required to be kept." 

6

 And it lists three things, the name, age, 

7

and place of residence of the person acquiring the gun 

8

from the gun dealer.  And then ATF has promulgated 

9

regulations that have added an additional layer of 

10

information that must be included on the forms. 

11

 But the government's position  of course, 

12

this question 11, who is the actual buyer, that's not 

13

one of the things that's included either in the text of 

14

the Gun Control Act or in ATF's regulations.  And what 

15

the government has said in this case is, well, that's 

16

right, but we view the authorization of Congress to 

17

create the form as sort of a blanket authorization to 

18

put  ask whatever we want in the form and make 

19

anything that we ask in the form information required to 

20

be kept. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Can you lie in  in 

22

answering questions that the government has no technical 

23

right to answer?  I mean, let's assume I agree with you 

24

that, in fact, this information was  the government 

25

was not authorized to obtain this information, and

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

therefore, it was not required to be kept.  But 

2

nonetheless they asked it, and your client didn't just 

3

say, I won't answer.  He lied. 

4

 Now, can you  can you lie, so long as the 

5

question is improper? 

6

 MR. DIETZ: 

Your Honor, I think the key in 

7

this case is that Congress included a materiality 

8

element for almost every false statement that would 

9

occur in this context.  And they enacted a separate 

10

statute that did not have that materiality requirement. 

11

 And the reason was Congress wanted to be 

12

sure that that provision that did not have the 

13

materiality requirement only applied to the false 

14

statements that Congress thought were the very important 

15

ones, and therefore they delineated what those  that 

16

category of statements was.  And the question on the 

17

form is not one of them.  And that, Your Honor, is the 

18

reason why Mr. Abramski cannot be convicted under that 

19

provision. 

20
21

 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time 
for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE 

25

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Thank you, counsel. 

Official

1
2
3

 MR. PALMORE: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 I think it would be helpful if I could, at 

4

the outset, frame what I see as the issues here because, 

5

as some of the questioning revealed, Petitioner is 

6

making two separate arguments.  His first argument is, 

7

in a sense, that there is no such thing as a straw 

8

purchaser doctrine.  I take that actually as a falsity 

9

argument. 

10

 He's saying when I answered that I was the 

11

purchaser, that was a true statement because I'm the 

12

only purchaser who counted for purposes of the statute, 

13

because I was the one standing there and I was the one 

14

filling out the form. 

15

 His second argument is an alternative 

16

argument, as I understand it, and he says, even assuming 

17

I'm wrong about the first argument and that this 

18

statement was false, that that falsehood was not 

19

material because my uncle was legally eligible to 

20

possess a firearm.  So I'd like to take those two 

21

arguments in  in order. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23
24
25

As to the first, are there 

two buyers in your view? 
 MR. PALMORE: 

I think, in a sense, you could 

understand there to be two buyers.  The buyer who counts

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

under the statute, though, is the actual buyer. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, what does  what 

3

does the person who's buying for somebody else  he has 

4

to provide both names or just the name of the real 

5

buyer? 

6

 MR. PALMORE: 

Justice Scalia, if you  if 

7

you hypothesize the situation in which two roommates 

8

wanted to buy a firearm together  firearms are 

9

expensive; they can't each afford their own, but they 

10
11

want one for personal protection. 
 And if one went into the store and said, I'm 

12

buying this firearm for myself and my roommate who's not 

13

here, that transaction could not lawfully go forward, 

14

because the two buyers of the firearm weren't in the 

15

store and they weren't physically present and they 

16

didn't go through all the statutory screening processes. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

take possession, right? 

19

 MR. PALMORE: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And both of them had to 

In that, right. 
But that's not the case 

21

here.  The person who paid took possession, was 

22

authorized to take possession . 

23

 MR. PALMORE: 

In the straw purchaser cases 

24

the person takes possession in an ephemeral sense.  They 

25

are merely the conduit.  The whole  the purpose and

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 effect of the transaction is to deliver that firearm to 

2

 someone else. 

3
4
5
6
7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Where in this  I'm 

 sorry. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So there are two buyers and 

 both of them have to be on the form. 
 MR. PALMORE: 

If there are two buyers, the 

8

 two people, the roommates, are buying, they would each 

9

 need to 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: Where's 

the straw buyer? I can understand you 

11

saying 

12

 the real buyer is the person who put up the money. 

13

 MR. PALMORE: 

Well, of course the form tells 

14

 you who the real buyer is, and it's a substance over 

15

 form inquiry.  And we think this is supported by not 

16

 only the text, but also the structure and purpose of the 

17

 Gun Control Act. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Where in the Act 

19

 does  is the basis for the requirement on the form? 

20

 The form says  you know, if you're not the actual, 

21

 you're buying for somebody else.  Where is that in the 

22

 statute? 

23

 MR. PALMORE: 

That is ATF's reasonable 

24

 interpretation of the statute and I was just going to 

25

 get to that. 

26

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Its current one.  It used

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 to have a different one. 
 MR. PALMORE: 

That's the current one, and 

3

 it's been consistent for the last 20 years, Justice 

4

 Scalia. 

5

 So the statute, we think with 

the text and 

6

 structure and purpose support this view.  The text is 

7

 most readily identifiable in Section 922(a)(6) itself, 

8

 which this Court in Huddleston 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

10

 MR. PALMORE: 

(A)(6)? 

922(a)(6), which is the count 

11

 1 of the conviction.  It's the false statement provision 

12

 at issue here, and this is quoted on pages 1 through 2 

13

 of the government's brief. 

14

 So the provision says: 

"It shall be 

15

 unlawful for any person in connection with the 

16

 acquisition or attempted acquisition of a firearm," and 

17

 it goes on, and it talks  and at the end it talks 

18

 about the "lawfulness of the sale or other disposition 

19

 of such firearm." 

20

 This case isn't the first one in which the 

21

 Court has had occasion to interpret those terms.  In 

22

 Huddleston the Court looked at those terms, in 

23

 particular "acquisition" and "disposition," and it said 

24

 several things about those terms that are relevant here. 

25

 It said those terms are meant to have a practical,

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 common sense meaning in terms of who will come into 

2

 possession and control of a firearm as the result of a 

3

 transaction with a federally regulated dealer, and they 

4

 don't turn on formal notions of legal title; and that 

5

 with respect to "disposition" in particular that 

6

 Congress meant to give broad effect to this term. 

7

 And so we think that the same kind of 

8

 practical common sense inquiry is applicable here.  When 

9

 looking at the transaction the question is what is the 

10

 ultimate purpose and effect of this transaction.  Is it 

11

 to have someone else acquire the firearm. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's awfully broad.  It 

13

 isn't the language, his point is  I think  that the statute, it has to be 

14

 material to the lawfulness of the sale.  Now, we look to 

15

 see what section is it material to, and you say in your 

16

 brief it's material to the section that says  you have 

17

 two of them, but they come to the same thing  selling 

18

 or delivering any firearm to any person. 

19

 All right. 

Now, he says did they sell or 

20

 deliver this firearm to what you call the real 

21

 purchaser.  No.  They sold or delivered it to the straw, 

22

 and that's the end of the matter.  And at least the 

23

 statute is open to this interpretation, and it's a 

24

 criminal statute.  And besides, the ATF for a long time 

25

 interpreted it that way.  So what we should do is

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 interpret it strictly. 
 Now, that's I think the basis of their 

3

 argument if I understand it.  And so you have to get 

4

 those words "sale" and "deliver" and explain how in a 

5

 criminal statute they apply to what you're calling the 

6

 real purchaser. 

7

 MR. PALMORE: 

Right, Justice Breyer.  The 

8

 statute uses a number of different terms to connote what 

9

 we take to be a substance over form inquiry into the 

10

 actual possession and control of the firearm.  So in 

11

 922(a)(6), as we were just talking about, it  talks 

12

 about acquisition, sale, or disposition. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But you also quote 

14

 "material," the need for it to be material to the lawful 

15

 ness of the sale. 

16

 MR. PALMORE: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Correct. 
You seem to concede that in 

18

 the brief.  It has to be material, and there are two 

19

 sections and both come to the same thing, which is what 

20

 I said. 

21

 MR. PALMORE: 

So this is where we get back 

22

 to the fact that there are two different issues in this 

23

 case.  If I convince you that there was a false 

24

 statement here because Petitioner's uncle was the actual 

25

 purchaser 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If he was  if he then 

2

 if he is the actual purchaser, then he falls within the 

3

 term of a person to whom the firearm was sold or 

4

 delivered.  That's your argument. 

5
6
7
8
9

 MR. PALMORE: 

And his name wasn't put on the 

 form . 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh, there's no question 

 about that. 
 MR. PALMORE: 

Right  so if I could just finish 

10

 one other thought on this first issue of falsity.  As 

11

 Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito's hypotheticals 

12

 demonstrated, under Petitioner's view of the statute I 

13

 could approach someone in a parking lot outside of a 

14

 licensed dealer. 

15

 I could say, would you like to make a quick 

16

 buck; please come in with me.  I could point to the 

17

 firearm I want.  I could hand him the money.  I could 

18

 look over his shoulder as his fills out Form 4473 in his 

19

 own name.  I could watch the dealer run that person's 

20

 name and identity through the criminal background check, 

21

 and as we leave the shop together he could hand me that 

22

 firearm. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why is that  why is that 

24

 any more horrible than the notion that as soon as I buy 

25

 it I walk out of the store and I meet this guy in the

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 parking lot, he says:  Hey, that's a nifty looking gun 

2

 there.  How much did you pay for it?  He says:  You 

3

 know, I paid 600 dollars.  I'll give you 700.  Oh, it's 

4

 yours.  Right?  I can hand it to him, can't I? 

5

 MR. PALMORE: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You could, Justice Scalia. 
So the notion that the gun 

7

 would somehow get into the hands of somebody who  you 

8

 know, who wasn't registered or who couldn't buy it 

9

 himself, I mean that's going to happen any way.  What you 

10
11

 assert does not stop that problem. 
 MR. PALMORE: 

Justice Scalia, Congress was 

12

 obviously balancing a number of interests when it 

13

 enacted these provisions.  If you read the text of the 

14

 statute and the legislative history, it's clear that 

15

 Congress thought the principal problem was effectively 

16

 unregulated sales of firearms from dealers.  That's the 

17

 problem it wanted to focus on. 

18

 And you're right that it didn't want to go 

19

 further and intrude on private transactions among 

20

 unlicensed individuals.  It drew a line, and it  but 

21

 it drew a line at a point where it thought the actual 

22

 problem was.  And that line was up to and including the 

23

 point of sale. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Palmore, when the 

 Agency changed its view in 1994, there was no change in

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

 the statutory text, was there? 
 MR. PALMORE: 

There was not, Justice 

 Ginsburg. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And at that time, the 

5

 interpretation was that you committed the offense if you 

6

 sold  if the person, the true buyer, was an 

7

 unlawful  a person to whom firearms could not be sold. 

8

 But if you  if the ultimate possessor was a lawful 

9

 possessor, then there was no liability. 

10

 So the  the statute has to be open, at 

11

 least, to either interpretation, no change in the words. 

12

 The Agency read it one way, and then later changed its 

13

 mind and read it the other way. 

14

 MR. PALMORE: 

That's right, Justice 

15

 Ginsburg.  And I think that takes us to the second issue 

16

 here, which is the materiality issue.  And I think what 

17

 happened was that the Agency's earlier view of the 

18

 statute was essentially overtaken by the case law in 

19

 several respects.  And the Agency therefore updated its 

20

 view and has consistently applied that view for the last 

21

 20 years. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yeah, but still  look, 

23

 what I thought was a very good argument on your side is 

24

 exactly what I said.  The narrow interpretation would 

25

 also apply to a straw man who buys a gun for Al Capone.

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And so this  this part of the statute would be 

2

 virtually worthless.  Their response to that is don't 

3

 worry about that. 

4

 There are plenty of other provisions that 

5

 will take care of that.  Are there?  And if it's so 

6

 obvious about the Al Capone, why did the ATF decide it 

7

 their way for 20 years?  I mean, how  how did they get 

8

 into that? 

9

 MR. PALMORE: 

Justice Breyer, I think 

10

 that  that the other provisions that Petitioner is 

11

 referring to is 922(d), which makes it unlawful for 

12

 anyone, licensed or unlicensed, to transfer a firearm to 

13

 someone in a prohibited category if the transferor knows 

14

 or has reasonable cause to believe that the person is in 

15

 a prohibited category. 

16

 And that is a completely inadequate 

17

 substitute for what  the kind of regulation we're 

18

 talking here for  for a variety of reasons.  One is 

19

 mens rea requirement that I just mentioned. 

20

 So in my  my hypothetical involving the 

21

 parking lot, the person  the straw purchaser doesn't 

22

 even know my name, much less anything about my 

23

 background, whether I was dishonorably discharged from 

24

 the military, whether I have mental health issues. 

25

 Doesn't know  anything about me.  He has no reason to ask.

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 I certainly have no motivation to tell him.  And yet 

2

 that transaction can go forward, and there could be 

3

 it would be very difficult to prosecute that straw 

4

 purchaser for an illegal transfer if it turned out that 

5

 I was a felon. 

6

 Second is the whole purpose of this 

7

 structure of this statute, especially after it was 

8

 amended in the early '90s, was to not  was to put in 

9

 place and reinforce a dealerbased regulatory system in 

10

 which the eligibility of firearm transferees is 

11

 determined based on a search through a database.  We 

12

 don't take even the transfer  transferees say so as to 

13

 whether or not he's an eligible person.  He has to fill 

14

 out the firm. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I think it's very 

16

 it's very problematic to talk about the overriding 

17

 purpose when you're dealing with a very sensitive 

18

 compromise.  There's, as far as I can tell, nothing in 

19

 the language of the statute that talks about straw men 

20

 or actual buyers or anything like that. 

21

 MR. PALMORE: 

You're right, Your Honor, just 

22

 as there's nothing in the mail or wire fraud statute 

23

 that talks about Ponzi schemes.  That  a Ponzi scheme 

24

 is simply a way 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, but there

Official

1

 wasn't  there wasn't a strong lobby in Congress saying 

2

 we're the group that supports Ponzi schemes, so maybe it 

3

 makes more sense to have a broad construction of that 

4

 provision. 

5

 This language is fought over tooth and nail 

6

 by people on the  you know, gun control side and the 

7

 gun ownership side.  And to say  you look at it and 

8

 say well, the purpose is this, even though there's no 

9

 words in the statute that have anything to do with straw 

10
11

 purchasers, I think, is very problematic. 
 MR. PALMORE: 

Your Honor, I think we do have 

12

 a textual argument, which I referred to before.  But 

13

 there's also  it's not just a purpose argument.  It's 

14

 a contextual and structural argument.  And it's the one 

15

 that Justice Alito alluded to in his question  

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you agree that 

17

 in Justice Alito's example, that person is regulated as 

18

 a gun dealer, right? 

19
20

 MR. PALMORE: 

At a certain point, a person 

 is 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

 MR. PALMORE: 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

24
25

The Yellow Pages. 

Right. 
They're putting an 

 ad 
 MR. PALMORE: 

If they're operating as a

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 seller of firearms, they would have to register. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I meant my 

3

 hypothetical.  So he doesn't have  he doesn't put it 

4

 in the Yellow Pages and he doesn't put it on the 

5

 Internet.  He just hangs around in the parking lot at 

6

 Joe's to accommodate people who  and Joe's is near the 

7

 border, and he wants to accommodate people who may take 

8

 it  who wish to employ him as a straw purchaser. 

9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You wouldn't think of 

 prosecuting him, would you? 

11

 (Laughter.) 

12

 MR. PALMORE: 

I mean, at a certain point, if 

13

 the  if the conduct is so pervasive and regular, if 

14

 he's acting as a dealer, then you might be able to get 

15

 him on that separate provision.  But you're right. 

16

 Before that point, you wouldn't necessarily be able to, 

17

 and that would be a perfectly lawful  lawful conduct. 

18

 And it's also important to talk  we were talking, 

19

 Justice Breyer, about 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

 MR. PALMORE: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Before you go on 
Yeah. 
 I wanted to get back to 

23

 the Al Capone hypothetical.  As I understand 

24

 Petitioner's case here, I don't think he's asserting 

25

 that if Al Capone, if  if he intended to transfer it

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 to Al Capone, that his statement would not have been 

2

 material.  His position is, since I intended to transfer 

3

 it to somebody who could lawfully possess it, the 

4

 statement was immaterial. 

5

 MR. PALMORE: 

And my point, Justice Scalia, 

6

 is that in a strawpurchase context, you're not 

7

 necessarily going to know you're dealing with Al Capone 

8

 or someone of his record.  These are often cases in 

9

 which people have an ephemeral relationship.  They may 

10
11

 not even know each other's names. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Palmore, is that 

12

 right?  I thought that Mr. Dietz's argument went beyond 

13

 what Justice Scalia just said, that for Mr. Dietz, 

14

 regarding  you can  he might be prosecuted under 

15

 another statute for selling something to somebody he 

16

 knows is Al Capone, but that he was  you know, because 

17

 he was the guy at the counter and he was buying for 

18

 somebody else, as to this question of material 

19

 representation, it does not matter whether the ultimate 

20

 transferee was Al Capone or somebody else. 

21

 MR. PALMORE: 

I think that's right, Justice 

22

 Kagan.  And that's his first argument and what I take to 

23

 be his main submission is essentially that his statement 

24

 was true. 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I think he said that just

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 right in here. 
 MR. PALMORE: 

Right, he did.  It was true, 

3

 so you don't even get to the materiality question.  So 

4

 that's right.  That subsequent transfer might separately 

5

 be a violation if he knows or has reasonable cause to 

6

 believe that the transferee is in a prohibited category. 

7

 I would just point out, though, that that 

8

 would not have been the case from 1968 to 1986 because 

9

 922(d), which prohibits transfers to ineligible 

10

 transferors  I'm sorry  transferees applied only to 

11

 licensed dealers until 1986.  It didn't apply to  to 

12

 private individuals. 

13

 So the kind of straw purchase on behalf of 

14

 Al Capone, as I understand it under Petitioner's theory, 

15

 would have been perfectly legal from 1968 to 1986, even 

16

 if it was knowing. 

17

 Justice Ginsburg, we talked a little bit 

18

 before about how ATF's view kind of caught up with the 

19

 case law.  And I think some of that case law is actually 

20

 quite helpful here for illuminating the materiality 

21

 question. 

22

 And it's the Crandall case from the First 

23

 Circuit that we talk about in the brief.  If Petitioner 

24

 is correct that the materiality of a false statement 

25

 turns on whether the ultimate  in this context,

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 whether the ultimate purchaser or the actual transferee 

2

 of the firearm was eligible or not, it's unclear why 

3

 a  someone seeking to buy a gun from a federally 

4

 regulated dealer couldn't go in, provide a false name 

5

 and provide a false identification and receive a gun. 

6

 And then if he's prosecuted for that false 

7

 statement, he could defend, as the defendant in Crandall 

8

 tried to defend, saying, well, it didn't really matter 

9

 because I'm actually eligible.  So even if you'd known 

10

 my true name and had my true nonforged ID, he would have 

11

 sold me the gun, so it's not material. 

12

 The courts of appeals and the lower courts 

13

 have consistently rejected that argument.  And what 

14

 those courts hold is that in all cases, the lawfulness 

15

 of the sale of a firearm from a regulated dealer is 

16

 contingent on the recording, confirming, and after 1993, 

17

 screening of the identity of the purchaser. 

18
19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Now, this  this 

 now you're talking about the second question. 

20

 MR. PALMORE: 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Correct. 
And the provision 

22

 that makes the  the information that's required, makes 

23

 it material  correct me if I'm wrong  is 922(b)(5), 

24

 right?  That's what requires 

25

 MR. PALMORE: 

That's one of the provisions.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay.  Now, all that 

2

 says is you have to keep the information of the person 

3

 to whom you're transferring the firearm.  So your 

4

 argument has to be, when somebody sees the person, they 

5

 realize that that means not somebody who's buying it for 

6

 somebody else, right? 

7

 MR. PALMORE: 

Right.  And if you're with me 

8

 on the straw purchase idea, that this was a false 

9

 statement because the purpose and effect of the 

10

 transaction was to  for the uncle to acquire the 

11

 firearm, then that was a false statement, then the 

12

 actual purchaser name is recorded 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes.  Yes.  I know. 

14

 If I assume  if I assume you're right, then you're 

15

 right. 

16

 MR. PALMORE: 

If you assume I'm right on 

17

 issue 1, then I think that the materiality on issue 2 

18

 follows directly from  from this provision that you 

19

 quote in 922(b)(5). 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Because then 

21

 "person," you know carries with it the concept of not 

22

 just the person to whom it's transferred, which is what 

23

 922(b)(5) says, but the fact that it's  has to be the 

24

 actual person who ends up with the gun. 

25

 MR. PALMORE: 

Yes.  And I think the term

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 needs to be looked at in context.  It's not just 

2

 922(b)(5).  There's also 922(t), which is the Brady 

3

 provisions, and there it talks about a transfer, so we 

4

 talked before about how there are different terms that 

5

 are used. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

7

 MR. PALMORE: 

8
9
10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Where  where is 

 that? 
 MR. PALMORE: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 (t), which says that you 

 can't 

11

13

Well, 922 

This is on page 13. 
Is that on the appendix to 

 your brief? 
 MR. PALMORE: 

No, I apologize, Justice 

15

 Scalia.  There's not an appendix, but this is quoted, in 

16

 relevant part, on page 13 of our brief. 

17

 So 922(t) says that the  no transfer of a 

18

 firearm can take place unless the identity of the  of 

19

 transferee is confirmed with a photo identification and 

20

 unless that identity is screened through a database to 

21

 ensure that that person is eligible. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

If you're right on Question 

23

 1, 922(t) just makes this a slam dunk on Question 2. 

24

 And there's a question about whether you are right on 

25

 Question 1.  But if you are, (t) says, look, the dealer

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 is supposed to check the transferee, right?  And if we 

2

 assume that when Congress says "the transferee," it's 

3

 the real transferee, not the fake transferee, the dealer 

4

 is supposed to check the real transferee. 

5

 So what does the dealer think is material? 

6

 mean, the question is, what does a reasonable dealer 

7

 think is material?  I better know who you are so I can 

8

 check you.  That's material. 

9
10
11
12
13

 MR. PALMORE: 

I think that's right, Justice 

 Kagan. 
 I think that anyone looking at 922(b)(5), 
 Chief Justice Roberts 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I can't look at all these 

14

 things because they are not in your brief.  I really 

15

 I really resent, especially in statutory cases, not 

16

 having the statute in front of us.  I shouldn't have to 

17

 flip through your  your brief to see what page you 

18

 cite a little snippet from one section on. 

19

 MR. PALMORE: 

You're right.  You're right, 

20

 Justice Scalia.  I apologize for not including a fuller 

21

 statutory appendix in this brief. 

22

 But the point is of 922(b)(5) when it asks 

23

 for the name of the buyer, one would ask, well, what 

24

 what reason  why is this name relevant?  Why is this 

25

 question being asked?  And this goes to Justice Alito's

46

Alderson Reporting Company

I 

Official

1

 observation about the structure and purpose of the 

2

 statute. 

3

 This name is clearly being asked because 

4

 Congress cared very much about preventing anonymous 

5

 sales of firearms.  It cared very much about having a 

6

 record of who that first buyer was. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, it's not just the 

8

 structure  it's not just the overriding purpose. 

9

 922(t) says that the dealer is supposed to check the 

10

 transferee to find out whether the transferee has a 

11

 criminal record, to find out whether the transferee has 

12

 mental illness. 

13

 So who does he check? 

Who is the 

14

 transferee?  Well, I need to know who the transferee is 

15

 to make that check.  So, obviously, it's material to 

16

 know who the transferee is. 

17

 MR. PALMORE: 

I  I agree, because those 

18

 requirements would be pointless if they could be 

19

 satisfied. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But it's going to be the 

21

 same problem, which is the straw because the transferee, 

22

 in context, probably refers to the person to whom the 

23

 dealer transferred the weapon; namely, the buyer. 

24
25

 And does it apply, for example, if he knows 
 that the buyer is going to give the  the weapon to

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 another person?  And you will say no.  Then he's not the 

2

 transferee, the other person.  You admit that.  You say 

3

 it.  And so why is the person to whom  the one who 

4

 puts up the cash is going to later transfer the weapon 

5

 is the same question as to whether he is really the 

6

 purchaser.  I just don't see a difference. 

7

 And, therefore, I thought  but you can 

8

 explain to me why there's a difference.  I'd like to 

9

 know that.  And I guess I'd like to bring you back to 

10

 the  to that issue and  and I'd just like to know 

11

 how the ATF reached the contrary conclusion if it would 

12

 so undermine the statute. 

13

 MR. PALMORE: 

Well, Justice Breyer, a couple 

14

 of points about this.  One, as we talked about before, 

15

 we think Huddleston suggests that these terms  and 

16

 Huddleston was interpret  was interpreting acquisition 

17

 and disposition, and it gave  it was stressed that 

18

 these had a practical, common sense meaning about who 

19

 was going to obtain possession or control of the firearm 

20

 as a result of the transaction, as a direct result of 

21

 the transaction. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

 MR. PALMORE: 

Then what about the donee? 
The ATF has never interpreted 

24

 this provision to  to prohibit gifts.  And a gift 

25

 recipient is in no sense a party to the gift giver's

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 purchase of the gift.  That's just not the way we think 

2

 of gifts.  The purchaser may change his mind.  The 

3

 purchaser is not acting at the direction and control of 

4

 the gift recipient.  And in ATF's experience, there's 

5

 not a problem with gift recipients. 

6
7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You don't think 

 that crime bosses 

8

 MR. PALMORE: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry. 
You don't think crime 

10

 bosses look at their underlings, pay them a lot of money 

11

 for whatever they're doing and just say, go get me a gun 

12

 and give it to me? 

13

 MR. PALMORE: 

Well, I think that that  I 

14

 would suggest that that wouldn't be a gift under that 

15

 scenario, Justice Sotomayor. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17

 MR. PALMORE: 

Why? 
That person is working for the 

18

 crime boss and as part of his duties to go obtain a gun, 

19

 then he's buying that gun on behalf of the crime boss. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you answer Justice 

21

 Kennedy's question?  Is  is this all contingent on the 

22

 intent at the moment?  I mean, you had a lovely wrapped 

23

 case here because you had the money transferred before 

24

 the purchaser, so there's no question that the intent 

25

 was to purchase for the uncle.  But what about the

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 situation where there's a conversation beforehand that 

2

 says, I'm going to buy the gun and I'll sell it to you 

3

 afterwards? 

4

 MR. PALMORE: 

I think the question  there 

5

 could be a factual question in some of these cases.  The 

6

 question would be:  Was that purchase made on behalf of 

7

 someone else?  There's no factual issue here.  This was 

8

 a guilty plea, so we have to assume that this 

9

 transaction was made on behalf of the uncle. 

10
11
12

 As a factual matter, Petitioner disputes 
 whether that matters legally or not and 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not sure what you 

13

 mean.  I gave you a hypothetical.  What  what  why 

14

 is it a factual 

15

 MR. PALMORE: 

Right.  And in your 

16

 hypothetical, I think that would be a straw purchase. 

17

 That purchase was made  even if the money was going to 

18

 come later, that purchase was made on behalf of the 

19

 absent party and it can't proceed for a variety of 

20

 reasons that 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

This is a criminal statute. 

22

 And  and you're saying that when  when I buy it and 

23

 I told somebody I'll sell it to you later, that I am 

24

 acting as an agent?  Wow.  It's a criminal statute. 

25

 MR. PALMORE: 

Justice Scalia, and Huddleston

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 is helpful in this regard, too.  There was a notice rule 

2

 of lenity argument made there because the person in that 

3

 case wasn't actually buying the firearm.  He had pawned 

4

 it to the pawn shop and he was redeeming it.  And he 

5

 came in and said, I'm not buying it, I'm just getting my 

6

 own property back.  I'm not buying it or acquiring it. 

7

 And the court relied, in rejecting that 

8

 argument, relied in part on Form 4473, because it 

9

 provided notice that he had to check these boxes and had 

10

 to truthfully answer the question.  I think it's rare 

11

 that you get a case with this degree of notice. 

12

 When the  when the defendant is actually 

13

 committing the offense and making the false statement, 

14

 he's told in bold letters right in front of him not to 

15

 do what he's about to do and it  and it includes a 

16

 hypothetical 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, he's not told 

18

 that in the statute.  He's told that in a form that was 

19

 quite different from the form that was used before. 

20

 MR. PALMORE: 

That's right, Your  Chief 

21

 Justice Roberts.  It's a form that's been used 

22

 consistently for  for 20 years.  And for the reasons 

23

 that we've said, we think that the  the current view 

24

 of the ATF and the express instructions on the form are 

25

 actually the most consistent with the statute, because

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the statute requires identification of a firearm 

2

 purchaser to be recorded, confirmed, and screened in 

3

 every case. 

4

 That's not contingent on the person turning 

5

 out to be eligible or not.  Congress wanted to prevent 

6

 anonymous sales of firearms, and it had a purpose, 

7

 obviously, to keep

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

As to whether or not there

Yes. 
 was  was delivered, 

13

 and suddenly the  Abramski finds that it's a valuable 

14

 collector's item.  There were only two or three of these 

15

 made, had a special trigger or something, and it's now 

16

 immensely valuable. 

17

 Could the uncle insist that it be sold to 

18

 him for the $700, or for the  for the agreed price? 

19

 The $400 thing?

 MR. PALMORE: 

Right.  But, of course, here 

2

 there's no subsequent sale because the check was written 

3

 beforehand. 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I'm asking about 

 that. 
 MR. PALMORE: 

Right.  I think if  if the 

7

 Petitioner changed his mind and decided not to actually 

8

 transfer it, I think, as a technical matter, that 

9

 wouldn't affect the legality because what mattered was, 

10

 was he making a purchase on behalf of another and 

11

 entering a false statement at the time he made it. 

12

 A fact question could arise in a  in a 

13

 situation like that, which a defendant could argue, I 

14

 wasn't actually making the purchase on behalf of someone 

15

 else, and that argument is supported by subsequent 

16

 events. 

17

 But I think we were  I was about to say 

18

 that the one critical purpose of the statute, obviously, 

19

 was to keep firearms out of the hands of ineligible 

20

 persons, but another critical purpose was to offer the 

21

 tracing of firearms and to prevent the anonymous 

22

 stockpiling of firearms. 

23

 And with respect to that purpose, I think 

24

 the facts of some of the cases underlying the circuit 

25

 split on the second issue of materiality are quite

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 salient.  Those are all cases in which eligible parties 

2

 wanted to anonymously obtain large quantities of 

3

 firearms for illicit reasons.  They were eligible, but 

4

 they had  they wanted to not have their name 

5

 associated with the transaction. 

6

 So Polk, which is the Fifth Circuit case, 

7

 which is actually on Petitioner's side, that person 

8

 wanted to anonymously acquire firearms to create a 

9

 stockpile to attack an IRS building, to kill police 

10

 officers, and to assassinate a judge.  But he was 

11

 eligible. 

12

 In Frazier and Morales, which are the 

13

 Eleventh and Sixth Circuit cases addressing this 

14

 materiality issue, there were straw purchases on behalf 

15

 of eligible buyers, but they were, again, wanting to 

16

 anonymously stockpile weapons and not have their names 

17

 associated with them because they were smuggling them 

18

 out of the country. 

19

 And the Petitioner's view of the statute in 

20

 which a straw purchaser can satisfy the requirement that 

21

 the first transaction, at the point of sale be recorded 

22

 would completely satisfy the statutory requirements, 

23

 would greatly impair the ability of ATF to trace 

24

 firearms and to have an accurate record of who that 

25

 first purchaser of the firearm was.

 If there are no further questions, we'd ask

 that the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

4

 Mr. Dietz, you have four minutes.

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. DIETZ 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. DIETZ: 

Justice Ginsburg, you asked 

8

 counsel whether this was a case where there were two 

9

 interpretations of the statute.  Counsel conceded that 

10

 there were.  I think that's an important point because, 

11

 of course, we're dealing with a criminal statute.  If 

12

 there are two interpretations under very wellsettled 

13

 precedent from this Court, the court applies the 

14

 interpretation that's favorable to the criminal 

15

 defendant and that's part of the doctrine of criminal 

16

 law. 

17

 Justice Kennedy, you  you mentioned the 

18

 the agency situation that existed here between 

19

 Mr. Abramski and his uncle.  And here, I think it's 

20

 important to note that there wasn't even any 

21

 consideration.  This was truly a purchase that was just 

22

 a favor for a family member. 

23

 And the government, in order to advance this 

24

 straw purchaser theory that historically came from civil 

25

 common law, there needs to be a relationship between

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Mr. Abramski and his uncle that is a fiduciary 

2

 relationship where Mr. Abramski is required to act in 

3

 his uncle's best interests at all times. 

4

 And that, for example, if he left the gun 

5

 store and someone said, hey, did you just pick up a 

6

 Glock, I'll buy it for you for $500, that Mr. Abramski 

7

 could not even enter into that sale without providing 

8

 his uncle with  with any money he made from that sale. 

9

 And there's  there's a complex set of 

10

 civil agency law principles that apply here that just 

11

 don't translate to the straw purchaser doctrine as we've 

12

 described it.  And I think that's a fundamental flaw in 

13

 the government's theory is that the courts just have 

14

 never thought through all of the various situations that 

15

 apply in these fiduciary relationships and how you would 

16

 apply them to situations where you're just buying a gun 

17

 for a family member or something of that nature. 

18

 I also wanted to turn to the gift exception. 

19

 There's also another exception the government 

20

 acknowledges and that's for raffles and contests at 

21

 charities or  you know, political fundraisers.  And so 

22

 in that circumstance, the person who's buying the gun 

23

 knows that they're giving it to a complete stranger and 

24

 someone who by random chance wins the right to own the 

25

 gun.

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But in those cases, the government says 

2

 there's no need, at the time that you buy the gun, to 

3

 take any steps to ensure there's recordkeeping or a 

4

 background check on that person.  And I think that 

5

 undermines this idea that everyone receiving a gun in 

6

 the chain from the gun dealer Congress wants to have a 

7

 background check.  Congress is concerned about providing 

8

 enough information to allow for tracing and nothing 

9

 more. 

10

 And as a final point, Your Honors, I think, 

11

 perhaps, the most important point in this case is if the 

12

 Court rejects the straw purchaser doctrine as it  as 

13

 it applies in this case to a lawful gun owner buying for 

14

 another, there are really no harmful consequences. 

15

 The government retains a very robust toolbox 

16

 of criminal statutes to prosecute illegal straw 

17

 purchasers, those who buy guns to get them into the 

18

 hands of prohibited persons, and the government will 

19

 receive accurate, truthful information about that first 

20

 sale so they can trace firearms when they're used in the 

21

 commission of a crime. 

22

 So the only thing the straw purchaser 

23

 doctrine in this case really accomplishes is to prohibit 

24

 lawabiding citizens from buying guns for other 

25

 lawabiding citizens, and that's something that Congress

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 expressly chose not to do.  And we would ask this Court 

2

 to remain faithful to the statutory scheme actually 

3

 enacted by Congress. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if we agreed with you 

5

 on the  on the second argument, would the government 

6

 have to prove that the person to whom the straw 

7

 purchaser transferred the gun was ineligible or would it 

8

 be a defense if it was shown that the person was 

9

 eligible? 

10

 MR. DIETZ: 

I think the government would 

11

 have the burden there, Your Honor.  And I think the 

12

 government has suggested  they provide an example of a 

13

 circumstance where the  the person who bought the gun 

14

 was buying it for someone named, I believe, Almonio, who 

15

 they had no idea who that was.  But, yes, in that 

16

 circumstance, the government would need to prove that 

17

 that person was prohibited. 

18

 But I think in circumstances like that where 

19

 you're buying guns for someone you don't even know who 

20

 that person is, the government may well have evidence in 

21

 that case that you either knew or had reasonable cause 

22

 to believe that that person was prohibited from 

23

 possessing a gun. 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But the other purpose that 

 they said this provision has is to get gun dealers to

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 run checks.  And you can't run a check if the name isn't 

2

 there. 

3

 MR. DIETZ: 

That's right, Your Honor.  And, 

4

 of course, you can't run a check on someone who wins the 

5

 gun in a raffle or 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  But the other 

7

 problem  we're back to the language.  The  there 

8

 they say your client  you know, falls within the 

9

 language and you say he doesn't.  Is it  all right. 

10

 Forget it.
