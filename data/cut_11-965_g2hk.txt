 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

first this morning in Case 11965, Daimler AG v. Bauman. 
 Mr. Dupree. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR., 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8

 MR. DUPREE: 

9

please the Court: 

10

We'll hear argument 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 The Ninth Circuit held that Daimler, a 

11

foreign corporation, is subject to general jurisdiction 

12

in California and thus may be sued in California on any 

13

claim arising anywhere in the world.  The Ninth Circuit 

14

reached this conclusion by attributing to Daimler the 

15

California contacts of a Daimler subsidiary, Mercedes 

16

Benz USA, a separate corporation that respects all 

17

corporate formalities and that is not Daimler's alter 

18

ego. 

19
20
21

 The Ninth Circuit's approach violates due 
process. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do we have to reach that 

22

question?  I mean, I guess the Ninth Circuit must have 

23

been interpreting the longarm statute of California, 

24

right? 

25

 MR. DUPREE: 

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Now, are there  were 

2

there California cases that disregarded the  the 

3

corporate form? 

4

 MR. DUPREE: 

California respects the 

5

corporate form.  The Ninth Circuit applied what appears 

6

to be a Federal common law of agency that the Ninth 

7

Circuit admittedly developed solely for purposes of the 

8

jurisdictional inquiry. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But the jurisdictional 

10

inquiry is conducted on the basis of the California 

11

statute, isn't it? 

12

 MR. DUPREE: 

It is, but at the same time, 

13

the California statute extends to the limit of due 

14

process.  And so what the Ninth Circuit did was it 

15

construed what the permissible outer bounds of the due 

16

process clause was in this context. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I see.  It's  it's 

18

California's reference to the outer bounds of 

19

jurisdiction that causes  causes this to be a 

20

constitutional case? 

21

 MR. DUPREE: 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's correct, Justice Scalia. 
There's nothing in 

23

the Constitution, is there, that would prohibit a State 

24

from adopting a rule that a parent is responsible for 

25

any acts of a whollyowned subsidiary?

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there 

2

may be a constitutional limit; certainly, to the extent 

3

that, say, California adopted a rule that said, for 

4

purposes of some sort of liability, we are going to 

5

disregard the corporate form, I think that could pose 

6

due process concerns to the extent that it is purporting 

7

to override, say, the corporate law of Delaware. 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, even on a 

9

prospective basis, your brief talks about notice and 

10

fairness and predictability; but if California said, 

11

going forward, this is the rule that we're going to 

12

apply, is there any constitutional problem with that? 

13

 MR. DUPREE: 

I  I still think there would 

14

be, Mr. Chief Justice.  In other words, I take Your 

15

Honor's point about fair notice, if California said, 

16

going forward, this is the rule we're going to apply. 

17

 But at the same time, I'm not quite sure 

18

what in the Constitution would empower, say, California 

19

to essentially override, say, Delaware's corporate law 

20

and say, for our State purposes, we're essentially going 

21

to rewrite the corporate DNA of a corporation that's 

22

chartered in Delaware in order to 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

We permitted that in 

Container Corp. 
 MR. DUPREE: 

I beg your pardon, Your Honor?

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

We permitted that in 

2

Container Corp.  We permitted California law to tax the 

3

parent California corporation for the earnings of all 

4

its foreign subsidiaries.  And we said the due process 

5

clause wasn't offended by that. 

6

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

7

typically, this Court has applied a less rigorous due 

8

process standard in the tax cases than it has in the 

9

personal jurisdiction cases. 

10

 If one were to look at, say, Goodyear or 

11

McIntyre, of any of this Court's more recent 

12

jurisdictional decisions, it typically takes a much more 

13

rigorous view of the due process clause's limits on a 

14

sovereign's ability to adjudicate matters that arise 

15

outside the forum than it has in the tax context. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

We would never get to 

17

this question if you hadn't conceded that there is 

18

general jurisdiction over the U.S. subsidiary, over 

19

what is it  MBUSA. 

20

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

21

respectfully disagree that we conceded the point below. 

22

I'm not sure, frankly, that we could concede something 

23

like that on behalf of a different corporation that's 

24

not a party to this lawsuit. 

25

 But it is true that we focused on the

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

attribution question in the Ninth Circuit.  And at the 

2

end of the day, I don't think that that point affects 

3

the outcome in this case because 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if there were nothing 

5

to attribute, then that would be the end of it.  If 

6

there was  if there was not general jurisdiction over 

7

MBUSA, that would be the end of the case, wouldn't it? 

8
9
10
11

 MR. DUPREE: 

Yes, it would.  That would be 

one way to resolve the case.  Another way to resolve the 
case 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you didn't  we 

12

can't resolve it that way since you  you didn't 

13

challenge the general jurisdiction over the subsidiary. 

14

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, again, we did not argue 

15

that point.  Instead, we focused on the attribution 

16

issue, but at the same time 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dupree  I'm sorry. 

Please. 
 MR. DUPREE: 

I was going to say, Your Honor, 

20

at the same time, I do think that that notion, that 

21

MBUSA was subject to general jurisdiction in California, 

22

was necessarily part of the Ninth Circuit's holding.  So 

23

I do think it is properly preserved for this Court's 

24

review, if the Court elected to resolve this case on 

25

that ground.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And, Mr. Dupree, even if you 

2

waived that point, if I understand it correctly, you did 

3

not waive the point that, even with all attribution in 

4

the world, there still is no general jurisdiction over 

5

Daimler.  In other words, you could attribute all 

6

MBUSA's contacts, and you still would not have general 

7

jurisdiction over Daimler; is that right? 

8
9
10

 MR. DUPREE: 

Justice Kagan, that is exactly 

right. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So in that sense, it really 

11

doesn't depend on the attribution standard, all these 

12

hard questions of is it an alter ego test or is it an 

13

agency test and how does the Constitution relate to 

14

State law because we could apply any test we wanted and 

15

there still wouldn't be general jurisdiction over 

16

Daimler in California. 

17

 MR. DUPREE: 

Justice Kagan, that certainly 

18

would be an acceptable route for this Court to resolve 

19

the case.  And Your Honor has it exactly right, in that, 

20

even if one were to attribute the constitutional 

21

contacts of MBUSA to Daimler, you would still be left 

22

with a joint enterprise that, plainly, is not at home in 

23

the State of California. 

24
25

 It would still be a German corporation, 
headquartered in Stuttgart, that draws only

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

approximately 2 percent of its overall vehicle revenue 

2

from California sales, so, yes 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is that a reasonable 
How do foreign  foreign 

5

countries resolve this attribution question?  Would 

6

would we be standing alone, or are there a lot of other 

7

countries that assert jurisdiction over the parent, if 

8

there is general jurisdiction over the sub? 

9

 MR. DUPREE: 

By and large, Justice Scalia, 

10

most other countries respect the corporate form and 

11

that includes parent/subsidiary relations. 

12
13
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

"By and large"?  Who  who 

are the small? 
 MR. DUPREE: 

I'm not aware of anyone who 

15

disrespects it; and, in fact, our amici talk at length 

16

about how California's exercise of general jurisdiction 

17

in this case would not be appropriate in virtually any 

18

other nation.  I'm, frankly, not sure where what the 

19

Ninth Circuit did here would be viewed as tolerable. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So how do we deal with 

21

that?  That's what's  I mean, it's in your interest to 

22

argue that  tell me how to deal with this. 

23

 It's perhaps true  I think it's true that 

24

a State doesn't have to allow companies to have 

25

whollyowned corporations.  Under the Constitution of

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the United States, nothing says they do.  Or a State 

2

could say, whollyowned corporations?  Well, there's no 

3

limited liability.  Or they could say, in certain kinds 

4

of accidents, there's n o limited  et cetera.  You see, 

5

they have lots of choice. 

6

 So what really seems to have been going on 

7

here is the Ninth Circuit, from your perspective, just 

8

really misstated California law by out to lunch.  When 

9

they say we want it to be as broad as the 

10

Constitution, they don't mean, because we could get rid 

11

of limited liability, that that's what we do. 

12

 So  so how can we deal with a circuit 

13

court that seems to seriously misstate the law of a 

14

State? 

15

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, I think the way this 

16

Court should deal with the Ninth Circuit in this case is 

17

simply to reverse it, Your Honor.  I think 

18
19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

what you would like as the bottom line. 

20

 (Laughter.) 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

I would like to know the 

chain of reasoning that gets 

23

 (Laughter.) 

24

 MR. DUPREE: 

25

I understand that that's 

The chain of reasoning, Your 

Honor, is simply that California, like all States,

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

generally respects the corporate form, certainly with 

2

regard to liability determinations. 

3

 In fact, this is a point that Professor 

4

Brilmayer makes at length in her amicus brief, where she 

5

says that it is anomalous for a State, on one hand, to 

6

respect the corporate form as to liability 

7

determinations, but then, when it comes to making these 

8

sorts of personal jurisdictional determinations, it 

9

applies a completely different standard. 

10

 So I think 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But suppose  but 

12

suppose we had a case of an accident on a California 

13

highway injuring California people and they sued, 

14

charging that the Mercedes Benz was defectively 

15

manufactured. 

16
17
18

 Would there be jurisdiction over both the 
parent and the sub in that situation? 
 MR. DUPREE: 

If it were the case Your Honor 

19

hypothesized, I think there may well be specific 

20

jurisdiction available, depending on whether Daimler 

21

purposefully availed itself of the California forum. 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And what does that mean? 

23

I mean, it certainly wanted to have its cars sold in 

24

in California. 

25

 MR. DUPREE: 

Right.  What this Court has

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said in its opinions in Asahi and then, of course, in 

2

McEntyre, is that you look whether the corporation 

3

targeted the forum.  And in Asahi, Justice O'Connor's 

4

opinion identified several facts that could support such 

5

a finding. 

6

 For example, whether the parent targeted 

7

advertising at the forum, whether the parent designed a 

8

product specifically for use in that forum.  And, of 

9

course, this Court has said, repeatedly, that questions 

10
11

of specific jurisdiction are highly fact dependent. 
 And so, in Your Honor's hypothetical, I 

12

think what the plaintiffs would do to establish specific 

13

jurisdiction over the foreign parent would be precisely 

14

to attempt to amass evidence showing that Daimler 

15

targeted the forum where they intend to bring the suit. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Counsel 
Well, there was injury in 

18

the forum, and it was caused by defective manufacturing 

19

abroad.  That's a typical basis for jurisdiction under 

20

longarm statutes. 

21

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, certainly, courts have 

22

exercised specific jurisdiction in that situation.  But, 

23

of course, as this Court's ruling in McEntyre 

24

illustrates, that's not necessarily always the case, and 

25

there may, of course, be situations where a product does

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cause injury in the forum, yet the foreign parent is not 

2

necessarily subject to specific jurisdiction in that 

3

forum. 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, how  how would you 

5

answer Justice Ginsburg's question if you were writing 

6

the opinion in your favor?  Would you say that, in the 

7

hypothetical, Daimler Chrysler put in motion a course of 

8

events that caused an injury in California?  Is that the 

9

way our jurisprudence works? 

10

 MR. DUPREE: 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well 
If you're going to answer 

12

the hypothetical in an opinion, how would you  what 

13

would you say? 

14

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, I think I would go back 

15

to what this Court has articulated, first of all, is the 

16

standard for specific jurisdiction, which is purposeful 

17

availment or purposeful direction.  I think as far as 

18

what constellation of facts 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, Daimler has 

20

purposely availed itself of California jurisdiction by 

21

establishing the sub that  that operates there by 

22

establishing Mercedes U.S., that it operates there. 

23

 MR. DUPREE: 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

Well, Mercedes 
So  so creating a 

subsidiary is not availing itself of jurisdiction?

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think, 

2

in some cases, a subsidiary's work could give rise to 

3

specific jurisdiction, but I think that's not 

4

necessarily true across the United States in all cases. 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I agree.  And I'm asking 

6

what is the rationale that you would use to answer 

7

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical in the  in the opinion 

8

for the Court that is ruling in your favor? 

9

 MR. DUPREE: 

The answer I would give is 

10

that, in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, the foreign 

11

parent could be subject to specific jurisdiction if it 

12

purposefully availed itself of the forum, and that very 

13

well could be an inquiry that turns on the subsidiary's 

14

activity. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And my question is whether 

16

or not by creating Mercedes U.S., Daimler didn't 

17

purposely avail itself of the forum? 

18
19

 MR. DUPREE: 

I don't think it did, 

Justice Kennedy. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

21

 MR. DUPREE: 

Because? 
Because I don't think there is 

22

any evidence in this record that suggests that, by 

23

creating a subsidiary that does business generally, it 

24

was purposefully targeting California. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dupree 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If we agree with you  if 

3

we agree with you that the test should be whether the 

4

subsidiary is an alter ego of the parent, would that 

5

depend on the  the law of the particular State in 

6

which the suit is brought?  Or would it be based on some 

7

general understanding of alter ego liability? 

8
9

 MR. DUPREE: 

Justice Alito, I think the best 

test would be to look to State law for guidance, 

10

precisely because that is the law that commercial actors 

11

throughout our country typically would look to, to 

12

determine whether or not they might be in a 

13

veilpiercing situation. 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That would mean that due 

15

process would mean something different potentially in 

16

California and New York, for example.  Wouldn't that be 

17

rather strange? 

18

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, I'm not sure, Your Honor. 

19

Certainly this Court, in other due process contexts, has 

20

looked to the substance of State law to inform its 

21

judgements, for example, in determining the scope of 

22

protected property interests.  In punitive damages 

23

cases, it's looked to State law to determine the 

24

constitutional boundaries. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Where else have we done

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it in the personal jurisdiction context, define the 

2

limits of the due process  Federal due process, in 

3

accordance with State law? 

4

 MR. DUPREE: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well 
Didn't we create tests 

6

in International Shoe, in Burger King, separate from 

7

State law? 

8
9

 MR. DUPREE: 

The test this Court created in 

International Shoe, I think, is probably best 

10

characterized as a Federal common law test.  I think 

11

that this situation is not quite analogous, precisely 

12

for the reason I mentioned in my answer to 

13

Justice Alito, is that commercial actors and lawyers and 

14

parties throughout the country typically look to State 

15

law for guidance. 

16

 And if this Court were to adopt a general 

17

Federal common law standard, under which I think we 

18

would still prevail, but 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what do we do with 

20

all the amici briefs that points to countless articles 

21

that talk about the corporate veilpiercing as the most 

22

arbitrary of State laws out there? 

23

 MR. DUPREE: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

Well, I'm not sure 
I don't know how  how 

corporations get any sense of comfort from a law that's

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

so irrationally applied, according to some. 
 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, I think some of the 

3

amici, candidly, may overstate the purported confusion. 

4

At the end of the day, veilpiercing law is certainly 

5

well settled and vetted in this country's legal 

6

traditions, and I think it is sufficiently capable of 

7

precise application in advance.  Corporations deal with 

8

that standard on a daytoday basis. 

9

 And so, although I take Your Honor's point 

10

that, at the margins, there may be room for debate as to 

11

whether a veil should be pierced in a particular case, I 

12

think, by and large, it's a general standard, it's a 

13

familiar standard, and it's a workable standard, and 

14

it's a standard that people look to on a daytoday 

15

basis. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Counsel, I've been looking 

17

23

 MR. DUPREE: 

That's exactly right, Justice 

24

Ginsburg.  It simply says that California may exercise 

25

longarm jurisdiction, consistent and to the limit

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

8

11
12

Thank you, counsel. 

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 
 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 As several questions from the Court suggest, 

13

the Due Process Clause itself does not supply fixed 

14

rules for the attribution of forum contacts from one 

15

corporation to another.  Rather, such rules are the 

16

province of the positive law that creates the 

17

corporation and other substantive law, such as agency, 

18

that defines the relationship of that juridical person 

19

to other persons. 

20

 And those rules are the ones that the 

21

corporations themselves rely upon and that others who 

22

deal with the corporations rely upon. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you tell me why we 

24

just don't rely on the tests we apply in the tax cases? 

25

It's a Federal test, and it says, if you're functionally

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and economically tied together and you control the other 

2

entity  the parent controls the subsidiary, your 

3

earnings are subject to the Due Process Clause and can 

4

be taxed by an individual State.  It seems like a fairly 

5

simple test. 

6

 And if you break down the complicated 

7

California test, really, that was the essence it was 

8

getting to.  So why do we go to the vagrancies of State 

9

law, and why don't we just do the true and tried? 

10

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

But in the instance you're 

11

talking about, in taxation  and this is related to a 

12

question the Chief Justice asked  the Due Process 

13

Clause does not, itself, prohibit a State or the Federal 

14

government from attributing substantive liability, for 

15

example, from a  from a subsidiary to a parent or, in 

16

the case of taxation, of choosing to look at the entire 

17

enterprise of which the parent corporation is the head. 

18

 But those are the results of deliberate 

19

choices by the lawmaking organs of the State, which 

20

State legislature, or when Congress does it, the Federal 

21

government.  They do not 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

California 
 reflect a general 

24

determination that in all circumstances, the acts of the 

25

agent or the acts of a subsidiary should be attributed

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to the parent.  In fact, the general rule is quite to 

2

the contrary. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, in the situation of 

4

individuals, does the  does the due process rule 

5

regarding taxation of individuals by a State align with 

6

the  the ability of somebody to sue that person in the 

7

State?  Somebody  for example, if someone is a partner 

8

in a law firm that has offices all over the country, 

9

they may be paying income taxes in many jurisdictions. 

10

 Are they subject to general jurisdiction? 

11

If there's a  if you have somebody who works in D.C. 

12

and never goes to California, but has to pay some income 

13

tax in California, are they subject to suit in 

14

California for any 

15

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

17
18

No. 
 claim that arises against 

them anywhere? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

No.  No, they are not. 

19

And  and for the taxation, there has to  for 

20

taxation to begin with, there has to be some nexus 

21

between the individual and the  and the State. 

22

 The rules that I think Justice Sotomayor was 

23

talking about in the Federal Tax Code has similar 

24

provisions, really have to do with the measure of 

25

taxation.  And in most of those situations, certainly,

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in taxation among the States, there is an apportionment 

2

formula. 

3

 Yes, the  the overall income may be lumped 

4

together for purposes of  of the initial step, but 

5

then there's an apportionment formula that says that 

6

in the Mobil case that's cited in the briefs, for 

7

example, that  that Vermont can only tax so much of 

8

it, that portion that is fairly attributable to Vermont. 

9

 So in that sense, it's analogous to a 

10

specific jurisdiction.  You're looking at  you're 

11

coming up with some formula to tie the taxation to the 

12

State that is imposing  imposing the tax. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Kneedler, what do you 

14

think about this, that  you know, as I've been looking 

15

through these cases, it seems to me that all these 

16

attribution issues and the conflict about attribution 

17

arises because courts generally have an improperly broad 

18

understanding of general jurisdiction and don't quite 

19

understand the distinction between general and specific 

20

jurisdiction. 

21

 If the courts  if the court here had 

22

understood that general jurisdiction applies when a 

23

company is essentially at home in a place, would any of 

24

these questions have arisen? 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Probably not.  The court of

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appeals  I think it's page 23 of its opinion  says 

2

that the reason that it looked to the  the question of 

3

whether the inState activities of MBUSA were important 

4

to Daimler was that the importance is a measure of the 

5

presence, meaning essentially doing business within 

6

within California. 

7

 And as we point out in our brief, the Ninth 

8

Circuit's approach to this traces back to early New York 

9

cases that  that address the question of doing 

10
11

business at a time when the business 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But that was  that was 

12

conceded.  But that was  there is a very substantial 

13

argument that there was no general jurisdiction over the 

14

subsidiary, but that was not contested below. 

15

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

17

consent to jurisdiction. 

18

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Yes. 
And a party can always 

Yes.  Now  but I think, in 

19

a broader matter  and also, I think the point that 

20

Justice Kagan made earlier that even  even if MBUSA 

21

was subject to general jurisdiction or if we  if 

22

that's accepted for these purposes, that doesn't mean 

23

that Daimler  you wouldn't attribute MBUSA's 

24

jurisdictional status to Daimler. 

25

 You might attribute its contacts, if the

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appropriate rules for attribution of contacts work in 

2

that. 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Just as a way of getting 

4

you to state your general theory of the case, let me ask 

5

you, do you have a recommendation as to whether or not 

6

we should remand this case?  If we accept your theory of 

7

the case, which I'll let you explain, does that require 

8

a remand? 

9
10

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

It  it does not.  And in 

our view 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

12

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

And that is because? 
Yes.  In  in our view, it's 

13

proper for the  for the Court to look to background 

14

principles of corporate law, at least as a starting 

15

point or as a presumptive matter.  And in this country, 

16

corporate separateness, under which a parent is not 

17

liable for the acts of a subsidiary, is the general 

18

rule. 

19

 There are established exceptions to that 

20

traditional exceptions, the alter ego exception and the 

21

situation where a principal is responsible for the acts 

22

of an agent. 

23

 Attribution on those bases, because they're 

24

traditional, would not offend traditional notions of 

25

of fair play and substantial justice under the Due

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Process Clause.  Here, Respondent does not argue 

2

Respondents do not argue for an  that alter ego was 

3

satisfy. 

4
5
6

 And as for agency, there's no argument here 
that traditional agency requirements are satisfied. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Under tradition, if you 

7

have the universe of agent and principal, an independent 

8

contractor, is the subsidiary of the latter or is it 

9

something  is it some third  some third animal? 

10

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I think  I think in this 

11

case  again, we don't have any reference to  at 

12

all 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Generally, if you have 

14

a  a corporate parent and a subsidiary, do we usually 

15

think of a subsidiary as an agent? 

16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, you  you do not. 
Do we think of it as 

18

what do we think about it as?  An independent 

19

contractor?  Or just something else? 

20

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

It  it's an independent 

21

entity.  It may be doing work for the parent, or it may 

22

not.  In this case, at page 179A of the Joint Appendix, 

23

the agreement between Daimler and  and MBUSA 

24

specifically provides that MBUSA is neither a special 

25

nor a general agent.  It says that MBUSA cannot act on

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

behalf of or bind Daimler, and it's not a fiduciary. 

2

 What 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, you don't  you 

4

wouldn't have any doubt, would you, in the hypothetical 

5

that I pose, a Mercedes Benz car causes an accident 

6

there's an accident in California.  It's alleged that 

7

the accident was the defective manufacturing of that 

8

car.  California people are injured.  There would be 

9

jurisdiction in a California court. 

10

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I  I would think so, 

11

particularly given the  given the agreement in this 

12

case which obligates Daimler to market throughout the 50 

13

States, and the volume of sales that are directed to the 

14

United States, some major portion of which is expected 

15

to be and intended to be in California.  I don't think 

16

there would be any question that California would have 

17

specific jurisdiction. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, of course, that just 

19

points out the difference between specific and general 

20

jurisdiction, that Daimler might be  might be found 

21

found it  there's jurisdiction over Daimler in a case 

22

which involves the blowing up of a car in California, 

23

but not over something that's not related to any of its 

24

contacts in California. 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Right.  That is  that is

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the  the major  that is the major difference. 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What would have to be 

3

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

If I could make a point 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What would have to be 

5

true for MBUSA to be Daimler's agent with respect to 

6

general jurisdiction?  How would the facts of this case 

7

have to be changed in order to bring this within an 

8

agency principal? 

9

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I think  I think MBUSA 

10

would have to be acting on behalf of Daimler.  One step 

11

in that direction would be if Daimler consigned the cars 

12

to  to MBUSA and that  and MBUSA held itself out as 

13

the sales agent.  Here, the cars were sold to MBUSA in 

14

Germany and  and sent to the United States. 

15

 But if there was an agency relationship, 

16

that doesn't necessarily mean that Daimler would be at 

17

home in  in California or whatever 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I mean, in most agency 

19

relationships, titles stay with the principal.  So I 

20

don't know  or  or when it doesn't, it transfers to 

21

the agent, but for the benefit of the principal.  So I 

22

don't know what the sale in Germany has to do. 

23

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, I  under this 

24

agreement, MBUSA is  acts independently.  It does not 

25

act day to day directly.

27

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, it seems an odd 

2

thing to say given the page and a half that the lower 

3

court went through on the various ways in which Germany 

4

controls this subsidiary.  It appoints all its officers. 

5

It approves all its operating procedures.  It approves 

6

all of the people it hires and fires.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Those are contractual

undertakings.  They are not the manifestations of 

15

agency.  Agency would require that  that Daimler 

16

control the daytoday operations of this subsidiary. 

17

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN RUSSELL 

22

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

23
24
25

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 I'd like to begin with the question of

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what's in this case and what isn't because the fact 

2

pattern in this case gives rise to multiple complicated 

3

questions, only two of which have been adequately 

4

preserved in this case.  And one of the questions that's 

5

not in the case, Justice Kagan, is whether or not, if 

6

MBUSA's contacts are attributable, they are sufficient 

7

to establish general jurisdiction. 

8
9

 This case has been in litigation on the 
personal jurisdiction issue for eight years.  Throughout 

10

that period, we have argued that if MBUSA's contacts 

11

were attributed to Daimler, they were sufficient in kind 

12

and quantity to support general jurisdiction over 

13

Daimler itself. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So if a Mercedes Benz 

15

vehicle overturned in Poland and injured the Polish 

16

driver and passenger, suit for the design defect could 

17

be brought in California? 

18

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's right.  And if you 

19

think that the answer to that is wrong, it's because of 

20

the argument that Daimler did not preserve. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, but, Mr. Russell, it's 

22

usually  it doesn't lead to good results when you 

23

assume something that is obviously in error  you know, 

24

it leads you to go onto a road that you wouldn't 

25

otherwise have gone onto and get to a destination that

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

might be improper itself. 
 So it's  it's bad practice  and I 

3

understand your  you know, idea about they didn't 

4

argue this, they didn't argue that.  But to assume 

5

something that's, obviously, a fallacy as your basis for 

6

a decision is not likely to lead you to a good outcome. 

7

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, that might be a reason, 

8

then, for this Court to dismiss this case as 

9

improvidently granted.  A cert petition  a grant of 

10
11

cert shouldn't be a GetOutofJailFree card. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Really, suppose I think 

12

that this was crying out for an en banc.  After you got 

13

your decision, we decided Goodyear, didn't we?  And yet, 

14

even though there is no effort to reconcile the case 

15

with Goodyear, as there couldn't be  we hadn't 

16

decided it  by the time we decided it, it still could 

17

have been taken en banc. 

18

 MR. RUSSELL: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right. 
But I guess we have no 

20

power at all to force the circuit, although that's what 

21

they are there for, to consider such a matter en banc. 

22

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's because Petitioners 

23

didn't raise that question en banc.  They filed an en 

24

banc petition after Goodyear came down  

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And they didn't say

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

anything about it 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

And they did not raise these 

questions. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Russell, they did 

5

talk about Daimler wasn't subject to general 

6

jurisdiction.  They didn't contest MS  MBUSA's being 

7

subject to general jurisdiction, but they said Daimler 

8

isn't subject to general jurisdiction. 

9

 So, you know, they didn't make the precise 

10

argument that they should have made, but they basically 

11

put the question at issue, is Daimler subject to general 

12

jurisdiction?  Answer, no.  Daimler is a German 

13

corporation.  If it were subject to  subject to 

14

general jurisdiction in California, so, too, it would be 

15

subject to general jurisdiction in every State in the 

16

United States, and all of that has got to be wrong. 

17

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, with respect, Justice 

18

Kagan, it's not as easy as you seem to think it is.  Let 

19

me give you an example.  In Perkins, this Court cited a 

20

prior case as a quintessential paradigmatic example of 

21

general jurisdiction, called Barrow Steamship Company v. 

22

Kane. 

23

 And in that case, it approved  this Court 

24

approved the exercise of general jurisdiction in New 

25

York over a British steamship company for a tort that

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

occurred in Ireland, based on the fact that it had an 

2

office run, actually, by another company  a mercantile 

3

company called Henderson

 MR. RUSSELL:

10

What was  what was the 

That was 1898.  But this 

Court 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes, but the thinking 

about jurisdiction has changed enormously since then. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

But my point is that this 

11

Court in Perkins, which is quite a long time after 

12

International Shoe, cited to Barrows as an example of a 

13

paradigmatic example. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

If there was ever an 

15

example of a corporation being at home in a particular 

16

place, it's Perkins against Benguet.  It was a 

17

Philippine company that was shut down entirely.  It was 

18

World War II.  To the extent the company was operating 

19

at all, it was in Ohio. 

20

 It was not able to operate in what otherwise 

21

would have been its home base, so everything that the 

22

corporation was doing occurred in Ohio. 

23

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Justice Ginsburg, just to be 

24

clear, I'm not saying that this case is like Perkins. 

25

I'm saying that, in Perkins, a postInternational Shoe

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case, this Court embraced the result in Barrows, which 

2

is a case quite like this one. 

3

 And more 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Russell, I'm still hung 

5

up on  on why we have to confront a Federal 

6

constitutional question.  It doesn't seem to me that a 

7

State statute which says we want to exercise 

8

jurisdiction to the extent the Constitution permits  I 

9

don't think that invites a Court to restructure standard 

10

State law and to say, we're  we're not going to 

11

observe the corporate distinction. 

12

 I guess you'd have to say we can hold the 

13

individual shareholders of a corporation liable because 

14

that might not violate the Constitution.  I don't think 

15

that when  when California adopts this statute it 

16

means to change its  its standard law regarding 

17

corporations, regarding individuals, and so forth. 

18

Why  why should we assume that? 

19
20
21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Because Petitioner, again, 

didn't make that argument, either 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But, now, we're  look at 

22

the odd thing.  It might not violate the Constitution. 

23

I mean, it's the same question, but it is bothering me, 

24

too.  It might not violate the Constitution of the 

25

United States, for a State to say, we don't have limited

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

liability in respect to the subsidiary corporation of 

2

a general corporation. 

3

 It's very unlikely to do that. 

It's going 

4

to be a big problem to get investment in that State, but 

5

it might not violate  it might not violate the 

6

Constitution as here, to say  you know, we are, in 

7

California, not going to have subsidiaries when a 

8

plaintiff comes in and sues on the basis of something 

9

that happened outside the country; but we will have it 

10

when, in fact, he sues on something that happened in 

11

California.  Now, a State could do that, I guess, but 

12

it's pretty odd. 

13

 And if you look what the  what the Ninth 

14

Circuit said in its opinion, it never referred to 

15

California law directly.  It's all Ninth Circuit cases 

16

or Second Circuit cases.  The only thing it says about 

17

California is probably something that was quoted in the 

18

Ninth Circuit case, something like that. 

19
20
21

 So what am I supposed to do? 

Because State 

law is up to the State.  How do I handle that? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

This case has been litigated 

22

on the interpretation of the California statute that 

23

says that California intended, notwithstanding what 

24

rules it applies for liability, to exercise personal 

25

jurisdiction to the furthest extent permitted by the

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Constitution. 
 And here, it's not that difficult a 

3

question.  Here, the question is, if Petitioner would 

4

have been subject to general jurisdiction in California, 

5

had it conducted the same operations through a 

6

subdivision in the case, does the Due Process Clause 

7

give it a constitutional right to avoid that 

8

jurisdiction simply by conducting those same operations 

9

through a whollyowned subsidiary 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So you think, in other 

11

words, that California has abolished  I mean, 

12

California says there is no corporate insulation, a 

13

corporation, when it tries to work through a subsidiary, 

14

that subsidiary has unlimited liability from lawsuits in 

15

California?  Is that what you think California law is? 

16
17
18

 MR. RUSSELL: 

California wants to go as far 

as the Constitution would permit.  We're not asking 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The answer then to my 

19

question is yes.  You think right today, in California, 

20

the law is there is no  there is unlimited liability 

21

for a corporation that is a subsidiary of another? 

22
23
24
25

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Not that there is unlimited 

liability, but that the exercise 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, you can bring a 

lawsuit, unlimited liability.

doesn't speak to liability, it speaks to personal 

4

jurisdiction. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Mr. Russell, is it clear 

6

that the California law regarding corporate liability 

7

would apply to all of your claims? 

8

 MR. RUSSELL: 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

10

No. 
You have  you have Federal 

claims, you have Argentine claims; isn't that correct? 

11

 MR. RUSSELL: 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's correct. 
California law controls 

13

personal jurisdiction.  It doesn't, does it, necessarily 

14

control corporate liability, let's say, with respect to 

15

the Argentine claims? 

16

 MR. RUSSELL: 

No, it certainly wouldn't. 

17

The choice of law principles would almost certainly 

18

point to Argentine law. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, but  but why 

20

should we  now that the Federal claims are out  I 

21

mean, when you started the suit, you had a claim under 

22

the Alien Tort Statute, you had a claim under the 

23

Torture Victims Protection Act, but now, those Federal 

24

claims are out, and we are left with a claim under 

25

California law and Argentinian law.

36

 Why should a Federal forum exercise 

2

supplemental jurisdiction over those claims once the 

3

Federal claims are out of the picture? 

4

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, certainly, we  we 

5

agree that if this case were remanded to the district 

6

court it would have discretion to refuse to exercise 

7

supplemental jurisdiction.  I would 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Wouldn't it be arbitrary 

for it to exercise personal jurisdiction when there is 

10

no Federal claim and the case involves foreign 

11

plaintiffs injured abroad, allegedly due to the 

12

activities of a subsidiary operating abroad? 

13

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Ultimately, we don't think so. 

14

I think you would have to take into account this case 

15

has been in litigation for eight years already.  I think 

16

that's a substantial reason for the Court to want to 

17

allow the case to continue. 

18

 I recognize that we would have a very hard 

19

time appealing from a decision that refused to exercise 

20

supplemental jurisdiction.  But, again, on the question 

21

that the Court actually granted cert on and which was 

22

actually preserved here, I do think that the Court could 

23

simply hold that, look, attribution of contacts between 

24

a whollyowned subsidiary and its parents is not so 

25

unreasonable as to violate the Constitution.

37

1

 At the end of the day, the due process 

2

question is whether the defendant had sufficiently 

3

availed itself of the benefits of doing business in the 

4

State to warrant an exercise of jurisdiction.  It can do 

5

that either directly, through its 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes, but that test that 

7

you just  the sufficiently purposeful availing, those 

8

are all specific jurisdiction questions. 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

11

jurisdiction questions. 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

With respect 
And not general 

With respect, I  I don't 

13

think that's correct.  Justice Kennedy's opinion for the 

14

plurality in Castro, for example, identified the 

15

underlying premise of both general and specific 

16

jurisdiction and availing oneself of the benefits of 

17

being in the State.  And 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And Goodyear 

19

distinguished the two by saying general jurisdiction 

20

means it's equivalent to residence for an individual. 

21

It's where you are at home. 

22

 The  and general jurisdiction was much 

23

broader in the days before longarm statutes.  But now 

24

that we have specific jurisdiction, so you can sue where 

25

the event occurred, just as specific jurisdiction has

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

expanded, so general jurisdiction has shrunk. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I understand that there are 

3

very serious and important questions with respect to 

4

what it means to be at home in a State.  And that, if 

5

Petitioner had raised those arguments below, it might 

6

actually have prevailed.  But this Court ought not to 

7

forgive that waiver in a case like this, and it ought 

8

not to decide that question when, not only is the 

9

argument forfeit, but it's barely been briefed in this 

10
11

case. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I  I understood 

12

the concession as being, that if Mercedes were the only 

13

corporation involved in this dispute, there would be 

14

specific  sufficient contacts.  That  that doesn't 

15

tell me anything about Daimler. 

16

 MR. RUSSELL: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

18
19

That is 
I'm  I'm not so sure 

that this concession is that troublesome for Daimler. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

No.  There has been one 

20

concession, which is that MBUSA's contacts are 

21

sufficient to subject MBUSA itself to general 

22

jurisdiction.  And there's been one forfeiture 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

24

the question about Daimler? 

25

 MR. RUSSELL: 

So how does that answer 

Well, because there's been one

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

forfeiture as well.  And that is, we've argued for 8 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

There has been one? 
Forfeiture, as well.  We have 

4

argued for 8 years that, if you attribute the contacts 

5

in MBUSA to Daimler, those contacts are sufficient to 

6

establish general jurisdiction over Daimler.  They're 

7

sufficient to satisfy the minimum 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

9

anyplace in the world. 

10

 MR. RUSSELL: 

For any claim arising 

That's right.  That's been our 

11

argument.  They could have said, no, that's not right. 

12

They could have said, MBUSA doesn't do enough business 

13

in California.  They could have said that general 

14

that doing business theory of general jurisdiction is no 

15

good.  They could have said, you can only be subject 

16

to general jurisdiction 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But I think their 

18

concession is quite consistent with the proposition that 

19

the distinction between parent and subsidiary is 

20

meaningful for jurisdictional purposes.  And that you're 

21

not just automatically an agent  you, yourself, do not 

22

defend the Ninth Circuit's position that, if Daimler 

23

gives enough functions to Mercedes that it has to give, 

24

that then Daimler is  is liable. 

25

 You don't  your footnote, I think page 35

2

reasoning to its full extent. 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's right.  We do think 

4

that this is an easier case because we have a 

5

whollyowned subsidiary that operates in very much the 

6

same way as a subdivision would.  Notice that in the 

7

Federal

Mr. Russell, could I 

does it not follow from  from your argument that a 

10

Federal court should entertain a suit against the 

11

shareholders of a foreign corporation when that foreign 

12

corporation has sufficient contacts in California? 

13

 MR. RUSSELL: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

 MR. RUSSELL: 

No, I don't think it does. 
Why 
But the question, ultimately, 

16

is whether it's fair to say that the defendant has 

17

sufficiently benefitted from 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Why is it any less fair? 
Because, unlike a shareholder, 

20

a parent company enjoys not only the economic benefits 

21

of the subsidiary's activities 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Don't the shareholders? 
They  they enjoy a partial. 

24

But in addition, they have  the parent has the right 

25

and, here, the substantial right to control the day to

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

day 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Don't the shareholders? 
No, they don't.  All the 

4

shareholders have the right to do is appoint the  the 

5

people to the board.  Here, Daimler exercised a degree 

6

of control that is much more significant than that. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I can't see a 

8

distinction.  And I think, if you stretch the California 

9

statute as far as you're stretching it, you  you have 

10

to assume that California would exercise jurisdiction in 

11

that case 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14
15

Well, I don't think 
 if you're the Ninth 

Circuit. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't think that's right.  I 

16

mean, this Court has recognized that, look, the Due 

17

Process Clause requires, ultimately, drawing some lines, 

18

but it can't be done in a mechanical way. 

19

 Here, Goodyear provides a safe harbor to 

20

companies that want to make sure that they're not 

21

subject to general jurisdiction in California.  They can 

22

do so by selling their cars to an independent 

23

distributor, the way Petitioner used to do and the way 

24

that Toyota still does. 

25

 But with respect to 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if you go  if you 

2

go back to the  to the foundation case of 

3

International Shoe, that case recognized that you can be 

4

an agent for one purpose, but not for another.  So the 

5

people  the salesmen who were promoting the sales of 

6

shoes were the agents of International Shoe for the 

7

purpose of promoting the sale of shoes.  They were not 

8

an allpurpose agent for the purpose of, say, dealing 

9

real estate dealings on behalf of the corporations. 

10

 So you could have an agency for one purpose, 

11

selling cars in California, but totally unrelated to 

12

torturing people in Argentina. 

13

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's right.  But the  but 

14

that  I think we need to separate the two ideas of 

15

what does it take to make Petitioner at home in 

16

California.  Once it's established that it is at home in 

17

California, it is simply a traditional aspect of general 

18

jurisdiction that it will be subject to suit for things 

19

that happened abroad. 

20

 If this suit had been brought against Apple 

21

Computer, which is headquartered in California, I don't 

22

think we would be here today.  The question here is 

23

whether the  the conduct in California is rendered 

24

insufficient by virtue of the fact that it was 

25

undertaken by a subsidiary.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's the same problem, and I 

2

don't know what to do.  It's really  Justice Scalia 

3

has been mentioning this problem.  You're seeing it 

4

through the lens of jurisdiction.  I'm not.  I'm seeing 

5

it through the lens of corporate law.  Five shareholders 

6

get together from outside California, and they set up a 

7

corporation in California.  Why?  To insulate themselves 

8

from liability, particularly lawsuits. 

9

 Now, instead of those five shareholders, 

10

everything is the same, but now, it's a German 

11

corporation, and suddenly, they can't insulate 

12

themselves from the lawsuits in California.  I think it 

13

unlikely that California would have such a corporate 

14

law, whether it goes by the name of jurisdiction or some 

15

other name, but that's a State law question. 

16
17
18

 So what am I supposed to do? 

That's where 

we started this argument.  And that's what I 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, Justice Breyer, if you 

19

think  if you think that the  the proper resolution 

20

of a case like this turns on issues that were not 

21

preserved below and have not been argued here, then you 

22

can do one of two things. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 MR. RUSSELL: 

25

What? 
You can dismiss the case as 

improvidently granted, or you can decide the case on the

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

assumptions upon which it's been litigated and make 

2

clear that you're doing that. 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, another thing we 

4

could do is we could say we've decided, now, two cases 

5

that seem to bear on this, and one is Goodyear, and the 

6

other is Kiobel; and we could say we'll send it back for 

7

consideration of this case, in light of those. 

8
9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

We would have no problem with 

that if you made clear that it was open to us under 

10

remand to argue that they didn't preserve these 

11

arguments.  That would be a fine result for us. 

12
13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Justice Breyer 

mentioned 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry Chief. 
 mentioned Kiobel. 

16

Do you still think you have a viable claim under Kiobel, 

17

or haven't you conceded that? 

18

 MR. RUSSELL: 

We are not prepared to concede 

19

that at this point, although we recognize we have an 

20

uphill struggle to fit ourselves within the exception 

21

that's been left.  Principally, our argument would be 

22

based on the fact that, at the time of suit, this was a 

23

dual American/German company with dual headquarters 

24

in  in the United States, which is different than 

25

Shell.

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 But we  we're not prepared to concede it, 
but we're not asking this Court to resolve it. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If this is as  as 

4

Justice Breyer and I seem to think, a question of State 

5

law, don't you think it's extraordinary that the Ninth 

6

Circuit could make such a significant holding on  on 

7

California law without  there is a certification 

8

procedure in California, isn't there? 

9
10

 MR. RUSSELL: 

There is, although 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So why  why wouldn't they 

11

have asked the California Supreme Court whether 

12

whether this jurisdiction statute was meant to alter 

13

corporate law or  you know, tort law, or  you 

14

know  just imagine any change in law that would bear 

15

upon jurisdiction, and all those changes must be assumed 

16

to have happened. 

17
18
19
20
21
22
23

 Couldn't  couldn't they ask that? 

Is that 

what this California jurisdictional statute means? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Sure.  They could have asked 

that.  Usually, they only ask those questions 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is it too late to ask it 

now? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, it wouldn't be, if you 

24

sent it back.  I mean, usually, courts of appeals don't 

25

ask those questions unless somebody asks them to.  And

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here, Petitioner never asked them to.  It assumed, as 

2

did we, that the statute meant that they wanted the most 

3

permissive attribution rule that's permitted by the Due 

4

Process Clause.  And I don't think it's unreasonable 

5

that's an unreasonable interpretation of the statute. 

6

 I recognize that it's a little bit 

7

problematic, that these statutes don't give greater 

8

definitive guidance.  But Petitioner hasn't complained 

9

about that either. 

10

 And so on the  the premises on which this 

11

case was litigated, I do think you can decide this case 

12

by resolving two questions.  First, on the assumption 

13

that if MBUSA's contacts are attributable to Petitioner, 

14

they are sufficient to make it at home, does the fact 

15

that those contacts are through a whollyowned 

16

subsidiary, rather than a subdivision, make the exercise 

17

of general jurisdiction improper 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But if we assume, for the 

19

sake of argument, that there isn't a preservation issue 

20

regarding this inhome  this athome question, why 

21

shouldn't the rule be that, unless a corporation is 

22

incorporated in the jurisdiction or has its principal 

23

place of business in the jurisdiction, the  the acts 

24

of the subsidiary are not attributable, unless it's an 

25

alter ego.

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 It's a nice, clean rule. 

Many of the 

2

prominent scholars in this area think that the American 

3

doctrine of general jurisdiction doesn't serve any good 

4

purpose.  Now, that specific jurisdiction has been 

5

expanded, it makes us an international outlier.  Why 

6

shouldn't we have a nice, clear rule like that, and 

7

everybody will know exactly where things stand? 

8
9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Just to be clear, there are 

two parts to that rule.  There is one that's the 

10

assertion that ordinarily, you're only at home in the 

11

place of principal business or principal  principal 

12

place of business or place of incorporation.  And the 

13

other is, oh, we'll only apply that rule with respect to 

14

subsidiary contacts. 

15

 That additional thing, which is necessary 

16

to  to shoehorn it into this case, I think, is very 

17

artificial.  So if this Court is going to 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What is  what is the 

additional thing? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

That we will only apply that 

21

rule if the contacts, if I understand Justice Alito's 

22

proposal, we only apply that rule if this  if the 

23

contacts in the State are through a subsidiary.  That's 

24

a very artificial gerrymander, honestly, to fit the 

25

facts of this case.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 If this Court is going to say that the doing 

2

business theory of general jurisdiction is no longer 

3

good law, it should do so directly, it should do so on 

4

a case has actually been briefed.  It hasn't been 

5

briefed here. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You did say, in your 

7

brief, that recognizing that other nations are highly 

8

critical of our expansive  at onetime expansive 

9

notion of doing business as a basis for general 

10

jurisdiction, you say that that shouldn't be taken into 

11

account as a basis for constitutional decisionmaking. 

12

 And yet, what we are talking about is a 

13

notion of whether it's fair and reasonable to require a 

14

corporation to answer in a forum and is  is what the 

15

other countries think unenlightening on what's fair and 

16

reasonable? 

17

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't know that you can't 

18

take it into account at all, but I will say that the 

19

the constitutional test is whether it's consistent with 

20

traditional notions of fairness and justice, meaning 

21

traditional American notions of  of substantial 

22

fairness. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Russell, how would you 

24

make the argument  and, again, with Justice Alito, 

25

sort of putting these waiver questions aside for a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

second, German corporation, incorporated in Germany, 

2

headquartered in Germany, 2.4 percent of its sales are 

3

in California. 

4

 How do you argue that it's subject to 

5

jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, not specific 

6

jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, which means over 

7

suits that have nothing to do with California or, 

8

indeed, as here, over in the United States, have nothing 

9

to do with anything that happened in the United States, 

10

how do you make the argument that Daimler is subject to 

11

general jurisdiction? 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I would say a couple things. 

13

I haven't briefed this, but this is what I would say in 

14

a brief, if we had the opportunity to brief it.  And 

15

that is it has done billions of dollars in business in 

16

California.  It's 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's 2.4 percent of its 

18

sales.  That would make it subject to general 

19

jurisdiction every place. 

20

 MR. RUSSELL: 

But the problem  but the 

21

problem is a corporation shouldn't be jurisdictionally 

22

better off simply because it's bigger than its 

23

competitors who are smaller and, therefore, necessarily 

24

do a bigger portion of their business in a smaller 

25

number of places.

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 I think it's  there is a very significant 

2

fairness problem with the proportionality test suggested 

3

by the government, again, never raised in this case. 

4

Nobody ever argued that MBUSA didn't do enough business 

5

in California, and in fact, it's done billions of 

6

dollars of business there, and it's enjoyed the benefits 

7

of being in the State, of doing business in the State, 

8

to a far greater degree than many of its competitors, 

9

say Tesla, which is subject to general jurisdiction for 

10
11

suits for anything that it does anywhere in the world. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

If it is subject to general 

12

jurisdiction in California, is it subject to general 

13

jurisdiction in all 49 other States? 

14

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think there would still be a 

15

question of whether  they would be able to raise 

16

the  the arguments that they haven't raised in other 

17

jurisdictions.  It may be that the billions of dollars 

18

that they are doing business in California is enough, 

19

but the few millions of dollars they do in Iowa is not. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So everybody is subject to 

21

general jurisdiction in, like, California and New York 

22

and Florida because they are big markets, but no worries 

23

about  you know, Delaware? 

24

 MR. RUSSELL: 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That may be the result 
That's a bad example.  Rhode

51

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Island. 

2

 (Laughter.) 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That may be the case if  the 

4

Court has always recognized that doing business is 

5

enough.  Back to the Barrow case, when just having an 

6

office, a sales office  another case that this Court 

7

cited in Perkins and cited in International Shoe as an 

8

example of a paradigmatic case was a case called Hausa, 

9

by thenJudge Cardozo.  And it was a suit by somebody from 

10

New York, who sued in New York, sued a Pennsylvania 

11

corporation, and the justification was it had a sales 

12

office in New York. 

13

 Now, if this Court thinks that those cases 

14

were wrong, if it thinks that we need to change our 

15

conceptions of general jurisdiction, in light of the 

16

evolved modern 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Isn't that exactly what 

Goodyear held? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

No.  Goodyear didn't purport 

20

to change anything.  I know you used a new phrase to 

21

describe the prior precedent, but it wasn't purporting 

22

to revise it, and I don't think that there was 

23

substantial argument in that case on that score. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, there would hardly 

be room for a decision next to Goodyear that says, oh,

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for general jurisdiction purposes, it's enough that you 

2

have some subsidiary operating in the State.  The whole 

3

idea of Goodyear was to say, there is one place you can 

4

always sue a corporation, one or two, place of 

5

incorporation, a place  principal place of business. 

6

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, again, if I can just 

7

respond to that idea, the one consequence of that  and 

8

getting back to what I would say to Justice Kagan  is 

9

people aren't subject to general jurisdiction only in 

10

one or two places.  They are subject to general 

11

jurisdiction anywhere they set foot and are served with 

12

process.  And I think it is quite unfair to say 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But people can be only 

one place at a time. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

But they go a lot of places 

16

over time.  And as a consequence, they are, in fact, in 

17

the course of living their lives or even doing business 

18

in an unincorporated forum, subject to general 

19

jurisdiction in a lot of places. 

20

 Again, this is an important question that 

21

hasn't been briefed in this case, it wasn't preserved 

22

below, and I think that you ought to decide the case on 

23

the grounds, on the premises on which it has been 

24

litigated for eight years.  And if you can't do that, 

25

you ought to dismiss the case as improvidently granted

53

or at least remand the case to allow a full airing of 

2

these issues in an appropriate forum.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If this 2.4 percent figure 

4

is important, wouldn't we get into impossible 

5

linedrawing problems?  What if it was 1.4 percent? 

6

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, you do get into 

7

linedrawing problems in this area.  This Court has 

8

recognized that, even in specific jurisdiction cases. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You think it should be 

10

billions of dollars, right?  We're talking about 

11

percentage, right? 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

13
14
15
16

I think billions of dollars is 

enough. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So we've got to pick a 

dollar amount, rather than a percentage. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, you have to pick some 

17

metric.  I mean, this Court's cases have always been 

18

general.  They have talked about minimum contacts.  They 

19

have talked about systematic and continuous business 

20

operations in the State. 

21

 And those  the Court has always recognized 

22

that those are not standards that are capable of 

23

mechanical operation or brightline rules.  If you think 

24

that you need to develop some new standards, you ought 

25

to do it in a case when it is squarely presented and

54

adequately briefed.

 If there are no further questions?

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Dupree, you have four minutes remaining.

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR., 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. DUPREE: 

Just a few brief points. 

8

First, with regard to Justice Breyer's question about 

9

remand, I think there is absolutely no reason for this 

10

Court to remand this case to the Ninth Circuit.  The 

11

issues as to attribution were fully briefed below.  They 

12

are fully briefed here.  I think that, were this Court 

13

to either remand the case or dismiss the case, for one 

14

thing, the circuit split would persist.  The Ninth 

15

Circuit's decision in the event of a remand would remain 

16

on the books. 

17
18
19

 Even if this Court were to remand the 
decision of the Second Circuit, which 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you really care how 

20

we do it?  Given that so many issues have not been 

21

adequately briefed, conceded when they are, obviously, 

22

fallacious and unsupportable, why don't we just say, 

23

simply, exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable in this 

24

case? 

25

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, Justice Sotomayor 

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The other side 

2

neither you or the other side have argued that there 

3

isn't a reasonableness component.  I know some of my 

4

colleagues don't think there is.  But both of you have 

5

proceeded in your briefing as if there is.  Do you care 

6

how you win? 

7

 MR. DUPREE: 

Well, yes, Your Honor, I think 

8

we do.  I think we do.  And let me say this:  I think 

9

that, with regard to Your Honor's points about issues 

10

being waived or forfeited below, the only issue that 

11

even arguably  even arguably was forfeited below was 

12

the discrete question as to whether Mercedes Benz itself 

13

is subject to general jurisdiction in California. 

14

 The question that Justice Kagan and others 

15

were inquiring about, namely, that even were one to 

16

accept the attribution theory and evaluate Daimler as a 

17

joint enterprise, would that render the combined 

18

enterprise at home in California, we plainly did not 

19

waive or forfeit that question. 

20

 In fact, we expressly addressed it in our 

21

opening brief, and we have been fighting in this case, 

22

from day one, to argue that, even if you were to 

23

attribute the contacts, there is no basis for 

24

jurisdiction over Daimler.  That question is squarely 

25

presented for this Court's review.

56

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 I also think that  as Justice Ginsburg and 

2

others have noted, there has been some confusion in the 

3

lower courts over the distinction between specific 

4

jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.  This Court saw 

5

it in Goodyear, for example, and I think that, were this 

6

Court to resolve this case on the ground that Justice 

7

Kagan suggested  or Justice Alito suggested, namely, 

8

that a corporation cannot be at home outside of the 

9

areas where it maintains its principal place of business 

10

or is incorporated, that it can't be subject to general 

11

jurisdiction anywhere else. 

12

 That would be a clean rule. 

It would be a 

13

workable rule.  I think it's fully consistent with what 

14

the Court said in Goodyear, and it would provide clarity 

15

and guidance to the lower courts and eliminate the 

16

circuit split that currently exists over agency 

17

jurisdiction. 

18

 A couple other quick points, Justice Scalia, 

19

I regret to report that neither the parties nor the 

20

courts below reproduced the text of the California 

21

statute.  The Solicitor General, however, to his credit, 

22

did on page 4 of his brief.  It simply says that, 

23

"California may exercise jurisdiction on any basis not 

24

inconsistent with the Constitution of California or the 

25

United States."

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And the Ninth Circuit panel, on page 19A of 

2

the Petitioner's appendix, said that, therefore, the 

3

question is this case  in this case is simply whether 

4

the exercise of jurisdiction would exceed the 

5

permissible bounds of due process. 

6

 The last point I want to make  and we've 

7

been discussing legal issues  is just to remind the 

8

Court of the facts of this case.  This is a case 

9

involving Argentine plaintiffs, suing a German 

10

corporation, based on events that allegedly occurred in 

11

Argentina more than 30 years ago.  This case has no 

12

connection to the United States, and it has no business 

13

in a California courtroom. 

14

 The Ninth Circuit's contrary conclusion is 

15

indefensible, and for that reason, we ask that the 

16

judgment be reversed. 

17
18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, counsel. 

Counsel. 

19

 The case is submitted. 

20

 (Whereupon, at 11:01 a.m., the case in the 

21

aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
