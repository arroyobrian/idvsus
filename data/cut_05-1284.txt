ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The Eighth Circuit held that Philip Morris

12

is subject to such specific and detailed regulations by

13

the Federal Trade Commission that it is entitled to

14

remove this purely State law case from State court to

15

Federal court under the Federal officer removal statute.

16

That holding is erroneous and should be reversed for at

17

least three reasons.

18

First, the court articulated the wrong test

19

for determining when a person is acting under a Federal

20

officer.

21

Second, the court misunderstood the Federal

22

Trade Commission's regulatory regime with respect to the

23

marketing of so-called light cigarettes.

24
25

And third, the court's approach ignores the
long history and purposes of the federal officer removal

Now with respect to the first point, the

What is happening here is that the Federal

Trade Commission for a time conducted testing on the tar

23

caused, in effect, a delegation of this authority.

24

what is really happening is that Philip Morris -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But

document or statement -

MR. FREDERICK:

-- that constitutes the

5

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

There is nothing,

order, there is no policy statement, there is no

8

statement by the chairman of the FTC before Congress.

9

There is nothing.

10

There is no regulation, this is no

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's perfectly

11

all right for them to adopt a new method of testing tar

12

and nicotine that yields numbers that are far lower than

13

the Government's method, and to publish an ad saying

14

these are our tar and nicotine figures, and the FTC

15

would have no problem with that?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

17

answer to your question is no.

18

what the FTC did at the time was, it determined that

19

this particular Cambridge filter method was the

20

preferred method for ascertaining the level of tar and

21

nicotine in cigarettes.

22

opinion of Federal -

23

And the reason is that

And in the D.C. Circuit

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not just the

24

preferred method, but presumably the only one they would

25

allow.

If you used another one, they would bring a

deceptive trade practices action very quickly.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

That is correct.

But what

3

was clear in the Brown & Williamson case decided by the

4

D.C. Circuit, a panel of Judges Bork, Scalia and

5

Edwards -

6
7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They still might

have gotten it right.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. FREDERICK:

They most assuredly did get

10

it right, Mr. Chief Justice.

What they held was that

11

that method, the Cambridge filter method, had not been

12

done according to rulemaking, a trade regulation rule;

13

and that, therefore, there might be a testing mechanism

14

that would be different and better, but that with

15

respect to undertaking the deception analysis, which is

16

what the FTC is charged by -- with doing under Section 5

17

of the Federal Trade Commission -- Federal Trade Act, it

18

had to determine whether or not there would be some

19

method that the cigarette makers were attempting to use

20

that would be deceptive; and what the court in the D.C.

21

Circuit held was that there was no other method that had

22

been determined at that time.

23

statement or proposed rule made by the FTC, and so for

24

purposes of determining deception, that was the best

25

that could be done, while leaving open the possibility

There had been no

that the FTC would promulgate the appropriate -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I understand

3

you have a dispute about whether that is this case, but

4

there are many areas where the Government requires

5

testing of products.

6

belts and stuff, and they specify very precise means to

7

which those tests have to be conducted.

8
9

You know, the strength of seat

And if someone, a manufacturer is complying
with those requirements, and a challenge is brought,

10

saying something to the effect that that test doesn't

11

give you a good measure or something, in that situation

12

would this removal provision apply?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

Because that's merely

14

compliance with rule and not aiding or acting on behalf

15

of the Government officer in a subordinate relationship

16

in the discharge of function.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the

18

Government says you've got to test your cars, you know,

19

every three months or something, and you've got to send

20

us the results of a random -- random test?

21

MR. FREDERICK:

The reporting of results

22

doesn't change the hypothetical.

That's also compliance

23

with the law, and that happens all the time in the

24

Government.

25

Commerce, the Federal Reserve, all of those agencies

12

And that subordinate relationship is what is

13

critical to understanding when in other contexts someone

14

might have a better claim to being a person acting under

15

a Federal officer than Philip Morris can assert in this

16

case.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is -- this is

18

certainly not your revenue officer needing help from a

19

citizen or the Federal agent going to close down a still

21

contractor cases that are cited, the Agent Orange was

22

one example?

23

But what about the Government

MR. FREDERICK:

The Government contractor

cases present a quite distinct set of issues that, of

course, is not present in this case because there is no

Morris.

3

Government contractors is to look at contextually what

4

is the nature of the contract?

5

provide for ongoing supervision by the Federal officer

6

and give the Federal officer the power to change or

7

alter the conduct of the contracting party?

8

mere specifications, detailed as they might be,

9

constitute simply compliance with the terms of the

But I think that the proper way of looking at

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do all these contracting

cases involve the contractor imposing law upon somebody,

executing law?

On behalf of the Government?

MR. FREDERICK:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In a couple Because that's your test.

16

I mean, and if that is the proper test, it ought to

17

apply in the Government contractor situation, too.

18

So, for example, the Government can hire a

private company run prisons; but that would be the

20

Government hiring somebody to perform Government -

21

Government functions.

function that remain as Government function, keeping the

23

incarcerated incarcerated.

contract cases involve that?

Now, do all of those -- a

it would be -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. FREDERICK:

Well -- a mistake for the Court

4

to either categorically say all Government contractors

5

are in or all Government contractors are out.

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that puts a whole new

theory on your -

8

MR. FREDERICK:

No, it doesn't.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh.

10
11

MR. FREDERICK:

Because my theory is that

12

the person acting under has to be aiding or acting on

13

behalf of a Federal officer in a subordinate

14

relationship in the performance of the officer's

15

official functions.

16

contractors, like the chauffeur in Maryland versus

17

Soper, for instance, who was an employee of the Reliable

18

Transfer Company, he was hired by the Maryland Director

19

of Prohibition to serve with the agents when they went

20

out doing their investigations.

21

And in the case of some Government

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And he was acting under

22

color of law as you've described that in your petitions?

23

I don't think so.

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:
Justice Scalia.

That's a different question,

The question of under color of office
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

as the statute defines it depends on the nature of the

2

acts and whether there is a causal relationship between

3

the acts that are charged by the State in the State case

4

and the actions of the people involved.

5

In the Soper case, the problem wasn't the

6

color of office, because the chauffeur was out with the

7

four agents, and when there was a death that they

8

stumbled upon, the question arose what were the nature

9

of the facts, not whether the chauffeur was acting under

10

color of office.

11

related specifically to whether a person is acting

12

under, but that's the third part of this question.

13

That would be a distinct inquiry not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I, I it seems to me

its appearance to somebody else is that -- that he is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How, how do you

11

distinguish your Blue Cross example from the instance

12

where drug companies are doing testing required by the

13

FDA?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

That's compliance with the

15

regulation.

There are all sorts of instances,

16

Justice Kennedy, where industry is required to do

17

certain things before they can bring their product to

18

market.

That's not acting -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Blue Cross is different

20

because there they are acting as an intermediary of the

MR. FREDERICK:

They are performing a

MR. FREDERICK:

The drug companies -- the

reason is quite clear from the fact that the Code of

The situation for acting under is different,

16

and in the Medicaid context, there's a very special

17

bureaucracy that has been created under the Secretary of

18

Health and Human Services to perform Government

19

functions that used to be performed that are now

20

contracted out to Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and I

21

acknowledge that that is a very different kind of

22

situation.

23

But the Government, of course, in a

25

items all the time.

Many of them are off the shelf.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And others are subject to very specific and detailed

2

specifications.

3

But the compliance by a contractor with

4

specific and detailed instructions would not itself

5

transform that entity into a person acting under a

6

Federal officer.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's a difference

8

between you are providing products and complying with

9

testing.

In other words, and if, in fact, the

10

Government specifies precisely how the testing is

11

supposed to be done to determine whether it, the

12

Government, will approve the marketing of a particular

13

drug, and the challenge, the litigation is to the

14

testing.

15

know, you tested this drug wrong, we think you should

16

have tested it some other way, and the drug company says

17

the Government told us how to test it -- why in that

18

situation aren't they acting under a Government

19

official?

20

Somebody sues as drugs company and says you

MR. FREDERICK:

Because it would be

21

transforming a preemption defense into an opportunity to

22

use a Federal officer removal to have a case from State

23

court to Federal court.

24

that preemption is an issue that can be decided by State

25

courts, and the mere fact that someone is complying with

claim the cause of action is preempted as a result of

One question that I think must have come up

in that context comes under the 1983 action in -

against a, a prison guard, a privately hired prison

certainly be a simple way to determine whether a person

entwinement test articulated by this Court in that case.

is a ongoing supervisory relationship and the Government

has the power to alter the actor's conduct.

acting under the Federal officer within the meaning of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If those

I don't follow that.

The

6

Government is always altering people's conduct when it

7

regulates them.

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

But not on a basis that is I

think appropriate to understand a subordinate

10

relationship.

11

Government regulation is simply compliance with law.

12

But to be acting under within the meaning of this

13

Court's cases -- and I would direct the Court to the

14

Greenwood case, which the other side basically

15

ignores -- in that case, in footnotes 17 and 20, this

16

Court made clear that the phrase "acting under" is

17

acting in that kind of subordinate relationship in the

18

execution of laws.

19

Otherwise, it would blow the whole statute apart.

20

Everybody in a regulated industry would able to remove

21

under the Federal officer statute.

The fact that there is alteration through

Compliance is insufficient.

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Ginsburg, in our

5

series of others, a bank, a credit union, have attempted

7

removed cases to Federal court on the grounds that they

are Federal officers because they are subjected to far

more extensive regulations than Philip Morris.

In fact, if you turn to volume 16 of the

there's a heading, and it says Deceptive Unfair

Advertising of Cigarettes For Health Benefits.

14

15

the argument that these other entities have made is

16

there are no Federal regulations concerning the

marketing of "light" cigarettes but there are

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But the problem with that,

8

what you're saying, is the 1948 statute expanded it all

Federal officers.

So if Federal officers were running

10

that cafeteria, those Federal officers could remove

11

because they are performing a duty under Federal law to

12

provide that service to Federal employees.

13

Now, once the statute expanded out in 1948

14

to cover Federal officers who perform any function, not

just enforcement functions, it carried with it persons

who act under Federal officers in performing those very

was simply the result of a commission vote.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Gornstein, was there

any Government litigation against the cigarette

companies?

15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

There has been Government

16

litigation against the cigarette companies for

17

allegations that are very similar to the complaint in

18

this case except that it is being brought under the RICO

19

statute.

20

and the basic allegation, one of the allegations of the

21

complaint, is that the cigarette companies have falsely

22

marketed their products as being lest dangerous than

23

other products when, in fact, they are not.

24
25

That litigation is pending in the D.C. Circuit

Now, the final point to be made is, even if
there was a delegation of authority here, it would not

affect the disposition of this case because this

complaint does not challenge the testing itself.

What this complaint says is that these -

that the Respondent here engaged in deceptive

would cheat the test and then marketing the cigarettes

18

performed by Respondents under the FTC's supervision and

19

transmitted to the public in Respondent's advertising at

20

the FTC's insistence is misleading; therefore, the

creation and transmission of the allegedly misleading

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Did the FTC ever adopt a

2

regulation saying you've got publish these measurements?
MR. OLSON:

No.

The FTC did not do it

3

through a regulation.

4

pages 93 to 110 of the Joint Appendix, you would see

5

testimony by the Chairman of the FTC and the head of the

6

consumer protection part of the FTC saying:

7

not to do it by regulation because we found that it was

8

much more efficient, much more fast, and much for

9

effective to force the tobacco companies into what is

10

called a voluntary agreement requiring precisely that

11

information.

12

If the Court were to look at

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We chose

But if one of the companies

13

had said, we're sick of doing this, we don't like the

14

numbers we're getting, whatever, we're just not going to

15

do it, presumably if we, you know, accept that testimony

16

at face value, the FTC would have moved and said, okay,

17

I guess we're going to have to have a reg or a statute

18

or what-not.

19

wouldn't be committing any offense?

20

During that period of time, the company

MR. OLSON:

Yes, it would.

In a 1978

21

advisory opinion, which is found on pages 202 of the

22

joint appendix, the FTC stated categorically -- and the

23

joint appendix, by the way, Justice Souter, is full of

exactly what I'm talking about.

in cigarette advertising must be consistent with the

we're not going to give any numbers, we're simply going

to say "Smoke Marlboros," and the FTC wanted numbers and

they wanted the numbers in accordance with the Cambridge

testing method, they would then have had to regulate,

5

adopt a regulation, or get Congress to pass a statute.

6

MR. OLSON:

It's fairly -- what happened,

7

it's fairly clear from what the FTC has said, they would

bring an action for deceptive advertising if there was

9

anything involved in the marketing of those cigarettes

that had to do with tar and nicotine levels.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Now, in my hypo they

just say:

We're not going to say the nicotine is low

MR. OLSON:

The history of that is set forth

in the record and it's clear.

And the answer is that the FTC

and much easier for you to enter into a voluntary

the FTC rejected because it allowed certain flexibility

with respect to the testing and didn't adhere

that that case could be removed under the Federal

No.

situation that we've got here?
MR. OLSON:

The difference, the difference

15

is, is that, A, the test is, is -- the FTC and the

16

record is full of this, too; the FTC set a goal for

17

itself very early in the regulatory process.

18

consumers to purchase lower tar and nicotine cigarettes.

19

Now how was it going to accomplish that, the FTC goal?

20

It devised this test.

24

Mr. Olson, that the cigarette companies wanted to make a

25

light brand so that they could keep customers who might
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

be tempted to quit if there was only the heavy kind.

2

But to say that, the light cigarettes were forced on the

3

cigarette companies by the FTC certainly -

4

MR. OLSON:

Well, in, in 29 -- this is in

5

the record.

The FTC set forth goals, it's 29 Federal

6

Register 530, in -- on January 22, 1964, that the FTC

7

described its goal as to encourage the development of

8

less hazardous cigarettes.

9

with a earlier or a contemporaneous -- nearly

That was done in conjunction

11

at joint appendix pages 57 to 60, that the Government

12

had as its goal the responsible promotion of cigarettes

low in tar and nicotine.

14

Now I'm not saying -

15

the Government supervises, certainly the Government

would want to promote a safer -- I mean, think of a jet

in red apples not being red.

2

thousands of apple lookers, and the apple lookers look

at all the apples and they devise a redness test which

is really fabulous, you know, very precise.

MR. OLSON:

JUSTICE BREYER:

So they say we hire

No.

The FDA has

the apple looking redness test, and the apple lookers

apply the test.

red apple, and if you don't pass the test you don't.

And if you pass the test, you can say

10

Now I'll give you two different things that happen.

they know how to perform a test.

you.

Here's

It goes into the laboratories.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then it

That wouldn't be relevant,

10

because the -- the problem with the, with the approach

that you're taking, as I see it, would be that, that

12

there are probably a lot of instances where a regulated

13

firm, the regulation meaning yes/no, market/not market;

14

yes/no, advertise/not advertise, performs all kinds of

15

tests to see if it is yes or no.

16

And if you're going to start taking that

17

kind of firm and breaking it apart to say whether it's

18

doing the testing part or some other part, you're really

19

opening the gates.

20

MR. OLSON:

But we're -- we're not.

We're

21

suggesting -- you're -- what you're doing in your

22

question and your statement is to disaggregate the

23

pieces of the process here.

24

it's FTC's method; it's the FTC's test which is

25

supervised but done by the companies.

Here it is the FTC's goal,

And now

So it's -- it's not possible to disaggregate

it.

It is a whole spectrum; the testing itself and the

So what you are

saying is that this function is so separable and it is

so much a FTC function and it is so much like delegating

it to the third party that did nothing of the testing,

that even if you delegate it to the second party which

still not enough to take it out.

the color of Federal authority that you talked about in

your dissenting opinion in that Acker case.

The Court in the Acker case, Jefferson

County versus Acker, said that the allegations in the

6

especially since they weren't challenged in this case,

7

the factual allegations and the characterization of the

accepted as true by this Court.

And Chief Justice

Roberts, it's not only the allegations in the complaint

and the characterization in the removal petition, but

12

it's what the district court decided the complaint said.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

here is the forum and removal; but if we were to rule

the core, the heart of the lawsuit, as the district

2

court said and the Eighth Circuit said is, you're doing

3

what the FTC required you to do, and the plaintiffs say

4

that it's deceptive.

5

And by the way, it's very clear from the

6

record in the joint appendix and in the district court

7

decision and in the remand in the motion -- the motion

8

to -- the petition to remove, that the FTC knew exactly

9

the deficiencies that are alleged in the complaint.

10

The FTC has been aware of the fact that

11

people smoke differently, that cigarette -- the design

12

of a cigarette may affect the outcome of the test.

13

what the FTC, knowing that full well, said, well, people

14

might smoke things differently and you might get more

15

tar and nicotine than the FTC ratings produce.

16

FTC with full awareness said, we understand all that,

17

but what we want is for the consumers to have an ability

18

to compare this cigarette with this cigarette, and we

have devised a test that will allow you to compare an

MR. OLSON:

That is the case.

The naked

I don't know

Is it the apple institute

No, I said apple institute.

13

You know, that seemed to me to be the case where it was

the apple institute or whatever it was that was the

delegate, and then they applied the test, and the people

16

they were applying the test to weren't.

17

MR. OLSON:

It's a facility of the tobacco

industry.

The FTC perceives it as -- these industries
