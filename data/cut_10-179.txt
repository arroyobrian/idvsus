We'll now hear

Mr. Richland.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. RICHLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Pierce Marshall filed a claim in Vickie

11

Marshall's bankruptcy case.

He alleged he was damaged

12

because she falsely accused him of cheating her out of

13

money that her late husband intended to give her.

14

order to preserve its claim against him, the bankruptcy

15

estate had no choice but then to file its counterclaim

16

in the bankruptcy court, alleging that those statements

17

were in fact true and that far from Pierce being

18

entitled to money from the estate, he owed money to the

19

bankruptcy estate.

20

the bankruptcy court was constitutionally authorized to

21

decide that entire dispute.

In

This Court's cases established that

22

Congress drafted the bankruptcy statutes -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's the authority at

2

all for a bankruptcy court to adjudicate proof of

3

claims, without violating Article III?

4

we've ever had a case that's actually said that.

6

MR. RICHLAND:

This Court has never

approached that issue directly.

MR. RICHLAND:

I don't think

Of course -
So, what's -

Excuse me, Your Honor.
So, what's the

constitutional basis?

11

MR. RICHLAND:

Well, of course, it need not

12

reach that issue in this case, because the court below

13

and the Respondents assume for the purposes of this case

14

that, in fact, there was authority for the bankruptcy

15

court.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure how that

Article III violation?

21

If there's no jurisdiction for the bankruptcy

MR. RICHLAND:

Don't both fall if there's an

Well, I don't think so, Your

22

Honor, because Article III, of course, is not

23

jurisdictional in the sense that we think of basic

24

fundamental jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction.

25

It can be waived, of course.

But beyond that, I think

that Marathon, as I said, assumes that there is Article

2

III authority to adjudicate the proof of claim.

So, answer the -

Katchen -
Answer the question.

Don't assume.
MR. RICHLAND:

Okay.

And -- well, the

answer is that, under -- under the various theories that

10

this Court has put forth, there is a basis for the

11

bankruptcy court to adjudicate a proof of claim.

12

One theory, of course, is the public rights

13

theory, and in Granfinanciera, this Court established

14

that the -- the public rights theory was broader than

15

just the kind of situation where the government was a

16

party, and it said that -- that it -- public rights are

17

defined as whether Congress, acting under Article I, has

18

created a seemingly private right that is so closely

19

integrated into a public regulatory scheme as to be a

20

matter appropriate for agency resolution with limited

21

involvement by the Article III judiciary.

JUSTICE ALITO:

The claim here was not one

that was created by Congress, though, was it?
MR. RICHLAND:

That's -- that's correct, but

this Court has never held that in fact the claim had to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

be created by -- literally created by Congress.

2

this Court has always talked about is -- is, is the

3

claim one that Congress has established as being

4

applicable within the system but that may be based on a

5

State law claim?

6

What

For example, when, you know, this Court

7

analyzed the claims which were at issue in

8

Granfinanciera, it looked at the fact that they were

9

fundamentally common law claims.

10

It didn't depend on

the fact that they were Federal claims.

11

The same thing was -- is true in the way

12

that the -- that this Court analyzed the -- the claim in

13

-- in Marathon itself.

14

because this was -- I think the way Justice Rehnquist

15

stated it was:

16

adjudicated at common law in Westminster in 1789.

17

was not the Federal or State nature of the claim, it was

18

the fact that these were common law claims that made it

19

important.

20

It made the determination that

This is the stuff that would have been

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So it

Are there any limits, Mr.

21

Richland?

22

bankruptcy courts to decide contract disputes between

23

two creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.

24

all right?

25

Suppose that Congress had authorized

MR. RICHLAND:

Would that be

I think that there are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

limits, and they must be related to the purpose of

2

bankruptcy.

3

be related to, perhaps, within the "related to"

4

jurisdiction of bankruptcy, and that would fall within

5

the problems identified in Granfinanciera, for example.

6

That would be beyond the scope of what could be

7

adjudicated in bankruptcy.

8
9

I think that a -- that sort of thing would

But what we are talking about here is claims
and counterclaims that are at the essence of what

10

bankruptcy courts do.

11

is set up in order to adjudicate claims to a limited

12

amount of money, and in order to do that in an efficient

13

manner, in a manner that will not utilize the entire

14

amount of the -- the estate in the adjudication process,

15

it set up the bankruptcy courts.

16

in order to be efficient, effective, and as soon as, of

17

course, as we get an Article III court involved, that

18

really does place some brakes on the efficiency.

19

becomes much more costly.

20
21

The bankruptcy system, of course,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It

Can the bankruptcy court

adjudicate permissive counterclaims?

22

MR. RICHLAND:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

what's the limiting principle?

25

And so they are set up

MR. RICHLAND:

Well -
And if you posit a no,

Well, certainly the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

statute -- 157(b)(3), (2) -- does not distinguish

2

between compulsory and permissive counterclaims.

3

it's also true that this Court's authority in

4

Granfinanciera, in Langenkamp and in Katchen -- the

5

rationale of those cases is broad enough to encompass

6

permissive counterclaims, but this Court need not reach

7

that issue in this case, because here we do have what

8

both the court of appeals below and what seems to have

9

been conceded by Respondents is, indeed, a compulsory

10

And

counterclaim.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Richland, isn't there

12

this difference:

Just to take ordinary civil procedure,

13

compulsory counterclaim doesn't have to satisfy any

14

jurisdictional requirements, because it comes in under

15

the wing of the main claim, but a permissive

16

counterclaim has to independently satisfy a

17

jurisdictional requirement.

18

So that could be a reason, even though the

19

Bankruptcy Code just says counterclaim, to distinguish

20

the two.

21

claim, then there's authority to deal with the

22

counterclaim, but if it's a permissive counterclaim,

23

it's not based on the same transaction or premise, then

24

it would have to be a self-standing claim.

25

you -- as you have said, this case does present what the

If there's an authority to deal with the

Alderson Reporting Company

But, as

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

parties have agreed is a compulsory counterclaim.

2

MR. RICHLAND:

Well, I -- I think that -

3

that is an excellent justification for why one might

4

want to make this a very narrow determination in this

5

case.

6

opinion in Marathon, said that this is an area which is

7

very touchy and difficult and complex, and it is one

8

where we particularly should not, as a court, go beyond

9

the facts of the individual case and what must be

10

In fact, Justice Rehnquist, in his concurring

decided for this case.

11

Of course, the other thing about compulsory

12

counterclaims and what makes it more applicable in this

13

kind of situation in an Article III setting is that,

14

according to the Schor analysis, what we are talking

15

about is how much of an intrusion on the Article III

16

process are we talking about.

17

appears to have been assumed here, that the claim itself

18

may be determined by the bankruptcy court, then the net

19

intrusion by determining a counterclaim, a compulsory

20

counterclaim, is much, much smaller, because there

21

almost inevitably will be overlap between what must be

22

decided by the bankruptcy court and what -- on the claim

23

and what must be decided on the counterclaim.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. RICHLAND:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there -- is there -

3

are there any cases in the -- in the Federal courts

4

which tell us that a motion for nondischargeability does

5

or does not require the pleading of a counterclaim?

6

MR. RICHLAND:

I don't believe so, Justice

7

Kennedy.

But in fact, what happened here was something

8

much, much more than just a motion, a request for

9

determination of nondischargeability, because 1 month

10

after that was filed, the actual proof of claim itself

11

was filed.

12

concluded that when that additional step is taken, it

13

could have no purpose other than to present the claim -

14

beyond just the question of dischargeability, present

15

the question of liquidation of the claim to the

16

bankruptcy court.

17
18

And all the courts below have uniformly

MR. RICHLAND:

That is correct.

Some weeks

counterclaim was filed.

22

was filed.

23

The objections and counterclaim

The -- the statutory structure here is

24

something that -- it has been suggested that this is a

25

question of statutory interpretation and that, in fact,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

the statute does not provide for this kind of treatment,

2

that, in fact, there is a two-step process by which one

3

determines whether a bankruptcy court can finally decide

4

a counterclaim.

5

the plain language of the statute as well as the

6

statutory structure.

7

But I think that really is belied by

Of course, the starting point is

8

157(b)(2)(C), which very clearly and straightforwardly

9

states that core claims include counterclaims by the

10

estate against persons filing claims against the estate.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you make of the fact

12

that -- that (b)(2) says core proceedings include, but

13

are not limited to, the matters that are listed after

14

that?

15

How would a court go about deciding whether

16

something that is not specifically mentioned constitutes

17

a core proceeding except by looking back to (b)(1),

18

which is what the court of appeals did?

19

MR. RICHLAND:

Well, I think that when -- a

20

court would indeed, if one were looking at something

21

that was outside the scope of the explicitly mentioned

22

categories from (B) to (N) in 157(b)(2), one would in

23

fact look beyond the words of (A) and (O) -- those are

24

the two catch-all provisions -- and one would look to

25

the usual, normal principles of statutory construction

14

on.

15

We would see, is this something that

Some of these

MR. RICHLAND:

That's right.

The -- (A) and

21

(O) are very broad.

And so, what -- that category -

22

what those two categories would have to be informed by

23

and are informed by are the principles of statutory

24

construction that are normally used.

25

those, we would contend, would be looking at the words
Alderson Reporting Company

And included among

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

of the statute that talk about, does this arise under

2

the Bankruptcy Code or arise in a bankruptcy case?

3

So for those particular categories, the

4

lower courts have been comfortable with the idea that we

5

look at the language of the statute, apply those words

6

and use those as limitations, but with respect to the

7

specific categories from (B) to (N), the courts have

8

uniformly indicated that those categories do not require

9

further interpretation, that they are straightforward,

10

and they constitute core proceedings on their face.

11

I think the -- with respect to the question

12

that you asked, Justice Sotomayor, and the whole issue

13

of whether a matter is under -- may pass muster under

14

Article III is a very easy one in this case.

15

reason for that is that if we look to Schor and Schor's

16

Article III analysis, we can see that it really divides

17

into two parts.

18

Part 1 is:

And the

Was there some -- is the Article

one, that is to the extent that it guarantees someone

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

4
5

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

I -- I'd like to begin by addressing Justice

7

Scalia's question about the -- what's sometimes referred

8

to as the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, whether

9

it's appropriate to place a person in a position where

10

he has to make a choice whether to assert one of two

contexts reluctance to put an individual to that choice,

there's not an inflexible rule against it.

he may be cross-examined at trial by the prosecution,

and he has no residual Fifth Amendment right to resist

24
25

He also has an absolute

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is a little -

it's a little different when you're talking about the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

right to have a -- a decision before an Article III

2

tribunal.

3

examples you're giving.

4

It seems a bit more fundamental than the

MR. STEWART:

Well, I don't know that it's

5

more fundamental than the right not to be questioned

6

against one's will in a criminal proceeding in which

7

you're -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, not -- not

fundamental in the sense of is it important or not.

I

10

guess "fundamental" is not the right word.

Maybe

11

"structural" or -- or something like that.

It's sort of

12

the whole basis for the decision that's going to be

13

made.

14

MR. STEWART:

I guess there are two

15

potential objections to the use of a non-Article III

16

judge, and one of them would be, as you say, structural;

17

that is, one of the objections that is sometimes made to

18

the use of non-Article III adjudicators is that if

19

Congress can parcel out part of the work of the

20

judiciary to other units, the stature of the judicial

21

branch will be diminished.

22

I think this particular statute doesn't

23

create that risk, because the use of bankruptcy judges

24

is entirely under the control of the district judges;

25

that is, the district court decides whether to refer a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

bankruptcy case to the bankruptcy judge; the district

2

court can withdraw the referral with respect to

3

particular proceedings.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that just

5

means that the district court is acting in concert with

6

Congress -- take action that undermines the long-term

7

institutional and constitutional basis of the judiciary.

8

And the district courts have their different reasons and

9

incentives to do that.

That doesn't mean that all bets

10

are off, and just because they're involved in the

11

process it's not a concern.

12

MR. STEWART:

Well, to the extent that the

13

concern is with fairness to individual litigants, that

14

is, the idea that the Respondent in this case has a

15

right to an Article III tribunal and should not likely

16

be held to have waived it, I think that a person who

17

seeks affirmative relief from a court doesn't waive all

18

his constitutional rights, to be sure, but should

19

ordinarily be taken to accept the consequences that

20

ordinarily follow from a request for judicial relief.

21

And as a matter of history and tradition, one of the

22

consequences that follows from the assertion of an

23

affirmative claim is subjection to counterclaims, and

24

especially compulsory counterclaims.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That can't be right.

You -- you can take all sorts of matters that belong in

MR. STEWART:

I

Well, the Court has applied

7

this basic principle in a number of contexts.

That is,

8

in McElrath v. United States, which is cited in the

9

Petitioner's brief, the plaintiff filed suit against the

10

United States in the Court of Claims, and the United

11

States then asserted counterclaims against him, and the

12

original plaintiff said that he had a -- a right to jury

13

MR. STEWART:

that situation had no alternative forum to which he

23

could attempt to obtain a recovery from the government.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's because of the

limitation of sovereign immunity, and you don't -- and
Alderson Reporting Company

you don't have that analogue here.

2

MR. STEWART:

Another example would be Adam

3

v. Saenger, which is also cited in the Petitioner's

4

brief, in which I believe it was a Texas plaintiff filed

5

suit in the California State courts, and the California

6

defendant asserted a -- a cross-complaint, basically a

7

counterclaim, against him, and the Texas plaintiff

8

objected to the California court's assertion of personal

9

jurisdiction.

10

And this Court said:

By seeking affirmative

11

relief from the California court, you have subjected

12

yourself to the jurisdiction of that court for all

13

purposes for which justice requires.

14

State can make that the price it pays for seeking

15

affirmative judicial relief in its courts.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it said the

Now, it may

A State can do that, but

18

can the Federal Government make it the price that you

19

pay for -- for going into a non-Article III tribunal?

20

MR. STEWART:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

Well -
It's a different situation,

it seems.
MR. STEWART:

Well, let me step back a

24

second and address the questions that were posed by

25

Justices Sotomayor and Alito at the -- at the beginning
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

21
1

about the initial authority of the bankruptcy judge to

2

adjudicate the claim brought against the estate, because

3

I agree with my colleague's answer that this is a

4

question -- and with Justice Sotomayor, that this is a

5

question that this Court hasn't squarely resolved.

6

Now, it's true that the initial -- that the

7

State law claim, the defamation claim that was made the

8

basis for the claim against the estate, was a State law

9

cause of action.

But as this Court said in Katchen v.

10

Landy, the effect of the commencement of the bankruptcy

11

case is to convert the claimant's potential legal claim

12

against the defendant into an equitable claim against

13

the estate.

14

And Respondent's equitable claim against the

15

estate seeking a share of the assets was a claim created

16

by Federal law.

17

of deciding whether Respondent was ultimately entitled

18

to a share of the estate, the bankruptcy court would

19

have been required to adjudicate State law questions and

20

conduct something like the same proceedings that could

21

have arisen in a State case, but actually obtaining a

22

share of the bankruptcy estate requires more than that

23

there be a valid debt.

24
25

That is, it's true that in the course

The whole point of bankruptcy is to deal
with situations in which the debtor doesn't have enough
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

22
1

assets to go around, and so the bankruptcy court will

2

have to not only determine whether a valid debt exists,

3

but what are the relative priorities of various

4

creditors, what is the appropriate pro rata share for a

5

particular claimant, and all of that is to be resolved

6

under Federal law.

7

So, when Respondent filed a proof of claim

8

in the bankruptcy case, it was asserting a Federal right

9

cognizable under the Bankruptcy Code.

And, again, none

10

of the -- none of the analogues that I've identified are

11

precisely analogous to this one, but I think it's

12

noteworthy that Respondent cites no contrary authority

13

from this Court.

14

which a claimant has invoked the authority of a

15

particular court and has asked for affirmative relief,

16

and this Court has held that it nevertheless had a

17

constitutional entitlement to be free of counterclaims.

That is, Respondent cites no case in

18

And that seems particularly true of

19

compulsory counterclaims, both because they are

20

counterclaims that our legal system affirmatively

21

encourages to be brought within the same proceeding and

22

for the reason that Justice Ginsburg said, that in an

23

analogous area of the law, when we ask whether there is

24

Federal court jurisdiction over a counterclaim to begin

25

with, if the counterclaim is compulsory, there need be

no independent basis for jurisdiction.
I'd like to address quickly the statutory

3

question, and the relevant provisions begin at page 1a

4

of the Government's brief.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Will you include in that

6

this 157(b)(5), because this whole thing would be a

7

futile exercise if that tort claim comes -- comes out of

8

the bankruptcy judge's -

9

MR. STEWART:

I think the 157(b)(5) is, in

10

our view, not jurisdictional.

It deals with the -- the

11

respective authorities of the bankruptcy judge and the

12

district court within the bankruptcy case, but it

13

doesn't go to the question of what the -- the Federal

14

courts can adjudicate and the limitations on bankruptcy

15

court authority are waivable and subject to consent.

16

The court of appeals did not address the

17

personal injury aspect of the case.

18

lively dispute between the parties as to whether that

19

objection to bankruptcy court adjudication was properly

20

preserved, and that would be open to the court of

21

appeals on remand if this Court were to reverse.

2

to fit into (b)(5)?

3

MR. STEWART:

I think -- yes, I mean, this

4

could have been a prudential factor that might have

5

persuaded the Court not to grant certiorari in the first

6

instance, but the Court has obviously identified this as

7

an issue that warrants the expenditure of its resources.

And we think that the -- there is no jurisdictional

impediment to a decision in this case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4

6

MR. ENGLERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are three possible grounds for

7

affirmance of the Ninth Circuit in this case, one

8

constitutional and two statutory; and the 157(b)(5)

9

ground which was preserved below received some

10

discussion at the very end of Mr. Stewart's argument.

11

But I'd like to start the meat of my argument just the

12

way Mr. Stewart started his argument, which is by

13

addressing Justice Scalia's question, and like Mr.

14

Richland, I'd like to talk about footnote 14 of the

15

Granfinanciera opinion.

16

Now, Granfinanciera had to distinguish

17

Schor, which is the only case in which this Court has

ever said a State law claim could be a public right so

19

that it could be adjudicated by a non-Article III forum

20

and not subject to the Seventh Amendment.

21

rested on a consent and waiver rationale and on a

22

structural rationale that an alternative Article III

23

forum was made available by Congress for everyone in Mr.

by the priority scheme of Federal bankruptcy laws, which

16

are passed pursuant to congressional authority -

18

4, which is why, in answer to the question Your Honor

19

asked first of Mr. Richland, although the Court has

20

never squarely addressed it, it's broadly accepted that

21

there is no problem with adjudicating what would

22

otherwise be State law claims by the creditor against

23

the debtor in bankruptcy.

That's what Marathon addressed; that's what

Granfinanciera addressed; that's what Katchen v. Landy

addressed.

Now, in Katchen v. Landy, the Court said the

case turned on or largely turned on the proposition that

Congress had prescribed that the counterclaim, the

preference avoidance counterclaim created by Act of

8

Congress, must be adjudicated before the main claim

against the res and against the debtor could or couldn't

be disallowed.

MR. ENGLERT:

Sure.

And the answer, I

11

really do submit, is footnote 14 of Granfinanciera,

12

pointing out that there's nowhere else to go for a

13

creditor in bankruptcy, which distinguishes bankruptcy

14

from Schor, in particular, but from all the other

15

settings in which the Court has said that by submitting

16

a claim, you subject yourself to the jurisdiction for

all purposes.

counterclaim against the creditor in a non-Article III

Alderson Reporting Company

When the debtor,

Official - Subject to Final Review

determine it, not just hear as 157(c)(1) says for

2

certain types of claims, then I suggest there is a

3

constitutional problem, at least with respect to claims

4

that neither, as in Katchen v. Landy, require rejection

5

of the main claim, nor, as in Katchen v. Landy, are

6

governed by Federal statute.

7

This is a State common law action for a

8

tort, which has importance for 157(b)(5), which has

9

importance for 157(b)(2), and which has extremely high

10

importance for the constitutional question.

11

In Marathon, as everyone here knows, there

12

was no majority opinion, but one point very much in

13

common between the plurality and the concurrence of

14

Justice -- then-Justice Rehnquist, was that it mattered

15

a great deal that it was a common law claim under State

law.

17

Here we have a common law claim -

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Without a proof of

categorically the same kinds of issues presented in

The only one of those cases that allowed a

State common law claim to go forward -- a State common

3

4

opinion into a part dealing with the personal rights

5

conferred by Article III, section 1, and the structural

6

rights protected by Article III, section 1.

7

And the

In the part about personal rights, the Court

8

held Mr. Schor had waived his personal right to an

9

Article III forum.

In the part about structural rights

10

at page 855 of that opinion, the Court said that it

11

mattered to the constitutional analysis that Congress

12

had made an Article III forum available for pursuit of

13

that claim.

14

So it is terribly, terribly important

15

whether an Article III forum is available.

16

forced into a non-Article III forum, as Pierce Marshall

17

was, if he wanted to have any opportunity to collect

at any of her pre-bankruptcy assets, he did have to file

But I believe that's not

I believe that in order to preserve the

Now, the two statutory arguments are before
the Court, and I'd like to say something briefly about
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

each of those two statutory arguments.

2

With regard to 157(b)(2), you have heard

3

Mr. Richland say this afternoon that the lower courts

4

limit subparagraphs (A) and (O) with the language

5

"arising in" and "arising under."

6

Richland say 157(b)(2)(C), subparagraph (C), doesn't

7

need to be so limited because it's so straightforward.

You heard Mr.

8

But the point is not how straightforward it

9

is; the point is how broad and constitutionally dubious

10

it is.

And if the canon of constitutional avoidance

11

means anything in limiting the scope of 157(b)(2), it

12

should have just as much application to (C) as it does

13

to (A) and (O), and the -- it is not as analytically

14

neat as some other cases of statutory interpretation,

15

but the most obvious way, if one is going to limit the

16

reach of (C) as well as (A) and (O), to do so is to take

17

the words "arising in" and "arising under" just as Mr.

18

Richland concedes they are used in limiting (A) and (O).

19

The alternative is to treat those words as

20

surplusage, and the alternative is to run headlong into

21

the constitutional issues.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you go back to that for

23

one second?

I understand the due process issue, which

24

is Brandeis's issue in Crowell.

not going to say anything that I can't read in the brief

whatsoever.

would seem to fall right in it.

case, that when she talks in the structural part of -

12

about -- when Justice O'Connor is talking about the

13

non-due process part, the structural part, just what you

14

said, that there isn't a hard-and-fast rule, that there

15

are a bunch of factors that we should look at.

Well, no, Justice Breyer, I

22

think I can agree with most or all of your premises and

23

still argue that we should win under the proper

24

constitutional analysis.

25

The point is not that the opinion of the

availability of an alternative Article III forum is

JUSTICE BREYER:

In Marathon, in Northern

Pipeline v. Marathon.

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, I'm not saying Marathon

12

makes this case a slam-dunk for me, Justice Breyer.

13

am saying Marathon rejects many, if not all, of the

No, I'm suggesting that they

reject one particular interpretation of Crowell, a very

21

broad interpretation of Crowell, because -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, Crowell involved

public rights in the -- in the narrow sense, didn't it?

MR. ENGLERT:

JUSTICE BREYER:

True, but it's also a -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And perhaps there should be

different standards.

4

separate opinion in Granfinanciera that that should be

5

the only category, there may well be different standards

6

for public suits in the narrow sense that were involved

7

in Crowell and public suits which are -- are governed by

8

some totality of the circumstances test, which -

9

Even if you do not agree with my

MR. ENGLERT:

I -- I agree with that -

10

excuse me, Justice Scalia.

11

think one doesn't have to adopt the reasoning of the

12

concurrence in the judgment in Granfinanciera to come to

13

that conclusion.

14

itself supports that proposition.

15

I do agree with that, and I

I think part IV of Granfinanciera

But I also think -- returning to Justice

16

Breyer's question, I do think Marathon does stand for

17

certain propositions that this Court has accepted in

18

later cases and that -- and that do suggest that Crowell

19

is not to be read broadly and that some of the

20

limitations on Crowell are the ones suggested in Justice

21

Scalia's questions.

22

The -- the thing that the concurrence, the

23

two-justice concurrence in Marathon, agreed with the

24

plurality on was that what was fundamental to the

25

disposition of that case was that the claim by the
Alderson Reporting Company

2

at Westminster in 1789.

It was a State law claim, not

doctrines so they could decide the whole case.

11

So I think that the one thing one can say

12

about Marathon is that when the debtor has a claim

13

against the creditor and the creditor hasn't made any

14

claim in the bankruptcy, he can't drag that into

15

bankruptcy court.

16

authority over the claim, the creditor's claim against

17

the debtor, then the court can clear up the whole

18

matter.

19

But once the bankruptcy court has

MR. ENGLERT:

If all we were talking about,

20

Justice Ginsburg, were doctrines of equity, then perhaps

21

Alexander v. Hillman would be the governing precedent, a

22

non-constitutional case later cited in a Seventh

23

Amendment case and now attempts to be imported into an

24

Article III case.

25

But I do respectfully suggest that the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

41
1

Constitution places tighter limits on the authority of

2

non-Article III tribunals to adjudicate counterclaims

3

than just the general and very permissive rules that

4

allowed equity courts to adjudicate counterclaims

5

without -- Alexander v. Hillman was a case about whole

6

Equity Rule 30 and whether it superseded section 51 of

7

the Judicial Code and its venue provisions and personal

8

jurisdiction provisions.

9

were equity, that would be a fine analysis.

10

If all we were talking about

But I do read the collection of this Court's

11

cases, including the crucial decisions in Katchen and

12

Langenkamp which involved Federal counterclaims that by

13

statute defeated the main claim, and Schor, which I do

14

believe relied heavily on the consent theory and on the

15

availability of an Article III forum -- I do read that

16

collection of cases to suggest that there are tighter

17

limits on assigning State law claims and State law

18

counterclaims to non-Article III tribunals -

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, by your theory,

20

you're basically saying that Congress cannot delegate

21

any State law-based claim to which a jury is entitled to

22

the bankruptcy counterclaim at all.

counterclaim.

2

Correct?

MR. ENGLERT:

I am saying that, Your Honor,

3

but let me say for a moment why that's not inefficient,

4

why that's not such a surprising proposition.

5

the bankruptcy court can hear all of these claims unless

6

they're covered by 157(b)(5).

7

them.

8
9

Remember,

It just can't determine

So, the only thing we're talking about is
the standard of review.

And with respect to -- it's not

10

a surprising proposition that the requirement of an

11

Article III forum does require that the district court,

12

the Article III court, decide those claims.

13

the -- my position is as broad as Your Honor's question

14

suggests, but the implications are not quite as broad as

15

Mr. Richland suggested when he said that an Article III

16

forum always brings in inefficiency.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- so

Mr. Englert, one real

18

difference between Marathon and this case is that

19

Congress passed legislation in between which brought the

20

bankruptcy judges under the control of the district

21

courts and made them entirely Article III entities.

22

you can look at a case like Marathon -- I mean, not -

23

supervised by Article III entities, not by the

24

President, not by Congress.

25

So

So one can look at a case like Marathon and
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

43
1

say the problem there was that the President appointed

2

the bankruptcy judges in a way that the President no

3

longer does and that the district courts did not have

4

the supervisory control over the bankruptcy judges in

5

the way that they do now, and that that makes a

6

constitutional difference.

7

MR. ENGLERT:

I -- I would respectfully

8

subject -- suggest not, Justice Kagan, because there

9

remains a difference between a non-Article III court and

10

an Article III court, and the degree of supervision does

11

not convert the non-Article III court into an Article

12

III court.

13

non-Article III forum in a way that gives slightly

14

tighter control to the judiciary.

15

It simply means that we've gotten to this

But as a whole line of cases, including

16

Crowell v. Benson, suggests, the degree of substantive

17

review of individual decisions by non-Article III

tribunals matters.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was interesting to me

Just clarify one point,

Mr. Englert.

6

amended, when the Federal courts were operating under

7

the interim rule, it was standard that the bankruptcy

8

judges, given a claim against the estate, routinely

9

dealt with counterclaims.

10

As I understand it, before the code was

Isn't that what the practice

was when the interim rule was in effect?

11

MR. ENGLERT:

I -- I believe the answer is

12

yes, Justice Ginsburg.

13

there was, I believe, de novo review in district court.

14

And in any event, the interim rules were in effect for a

15

very short time as the arc of constitutional decision

16

making goes.

17

I can concede that point.

Marathon was decided in 1982.

But

Congress

18

passed new legislation in 1984, and it took quite

19

sometime for the interim rules to be put into effect.

decisions of -- of lower courts, not of this Court.
Now, on the personal injury tort provision

11

in section 157(b)(5), which, by the way, is also

12

repeated in 157(b)(2)(B) and in 157(b)(2)(O) to give

13

emphasis to the fact that Congress really did not want

bankruptcy judges trying personal injury tort claims.

injury tort claim.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- if we were to decide

this case, and suppose we decide every other question

8

and suppose you lost, then wouldn't we send it back for

The constitutional question is hard.

8

MR. ENGLERT:

Is -- is?

If it's that hard, why
I guess that -

No, but really, the 157(b)(5)

question is -- is easy, but the strongest argument

10

Mr. Richland makes on the merits of the 157(b)(5) claim

11

is that Congress meant only bodily injury when it

12

referred to personal injury.

13

the code uses the term "bodily injury," so we know that

14

when Congress means bodily injury, it says bodily

15

injury.

16

"personal injury or wrongful death" is a phrase to which

17

the canons of interpretation, noscitur a sociis and

19

used "personal injury or wrongful death."

But section 522(d)(11) of

It's also been suggested that the phrase

That's not why Congress

Until 1846, with Lord Campbell's Act, the

21

common law of England was that a wrongful death claim

didn't survive, couldn't be brought by the -- by the

heirs, because the victim of the tort was dead.

6

there is legislative history indicating quite

emphatically that the members of Congress who were

responsible for adding 157(b)(5), amending 157(b)(2)(B),

9

amending 157(b)(O), and putting the abstention

provisions in section 1334(c) really meant for

11

bankruptcy judges to keep their hands off personal

12

injury claims.

It doesn't mean bodily

And for those who look at legislative history,

13

The main claim in this case that conceivably

14

could have given the bankruptcy court jurisdiction, if I

15

lose on the other issues, was Pierce's defamation claim,

16

not Vickie's intentional interference claim.

17

respectfully suggest they're both personal injury tort

18

claims, but it's particularly clear that Pierce's

defamation claim is an injury to his personal interest

in reputation.

So either by resolving the constitutional

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. RICHLAND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

Let me address immediately this question of

6

whether Judge Keller effectively denied this -- this

7

withdrawal motion on timeliness grounds or not, because

8

that truly is the easy way of resolving this personal

9

injury question.

The substantive question of whether

10

these particular torts fall within the personal injury

11

exception is a most difficult one, and it is one that

12

this Court really shouldn't take on unless there's a

13

substantial amount more of briefing and input from -

14

from others.

15

But the waiver issue is an easy one, and the

16

reason it's an easy one is the record is undisputed that

17

it was 27 months between the time that this claim -

18

counterclaim was -- claim was filed and between the time

19

that this personal injury issue was raised in a

20

withdrawal motion.

21

were numerous sanctions motions and numerous sanctions,

22

discovery sanctions imposed upon Pierce Marshall.

23

in fact, what happened was Judge Keller, before

24

considering the initial withdrawal motion on the

25

merits -- before having a hearing on it, he initially

During that period of time there

the hearing what he said was -- he may not have used the

word "timeliness," but what he said was you've chosen

4

this forum, the bankruptcy court is immersed in this

5

case, and he used the colorful phrase what you are

6

experiencing here is the spawn of what you have begot.

7

He then had a hearing, and at

And I think that that clearly imports the

8

nature that you are too late, you have not brought this

11

this court at this time.

And that -
Volenti non fit injuria.

17

You chose to come into the court, and this is the spawn

18

of your coming in.

19

MR. RICHLAND:

so immersed in this because of what has gone on during

That's timely.

6

counterclaim was to the proof of claim or to the

dischargeability.

to 170 -- 157(b)(2)(C).

12

law having some great significance here as opposed to
