Mr. Stern.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL STERN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. STERN:

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Congress has left to the States and

12

encouraged them to deal with the significant public

13

health problem of youth access to tobacco.

14

presented is whether the FAAA Act nonetheless preempts

15

the two State laws before the Court and those laws that

16

ensure that tobacco shipped into the State of Maine does

17

not end up in the hands of our children.

The question

18

It is not contested that Maine can and, in

19

fact, has banned the retail sale of tobacco unless the

20

seller verifies the age of the buyer.

21

1555-C(3)(C) regulates the seller and not a carrier.

22

requires that a -- in the context of a delivery sale, a

23

seller cannot engage in that sale in the State of Maine

24

unless the seller ensures that the person delivering the

25

tobacco actually verifies the age of the buyer.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Section

This

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

law does not relate to the services of the carrier, but

2

rather relates to a dangerous substance that Congress

3

has asked the States and left to the States and

4

encouraged the States to deal with.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, certainly that

6

may be true, but it certainly relates to the service of

7

a carrier.

8

can't read that language literally.

9
10

I understood your argument to be that we

MR. STERN:

Exactly -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It talks about what

11

carriers have to do, so -- in connection with delivery,

12

so it relates to the service of the motor carrier.

13

MR. STERN:

Well, Your Honor, section 1555-C

14

(3)(C) does not dictate at all what a carrier has to do.

15

It is an incentive that permits a carrier, if the

16

carrier wishes to compete on a level playing field for

17

the legal tobacco delivery market -

18
19
20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
what they have to do.
MR. STERN:

It doesn't dictate

They can get out of the business.
They can get out of the business

21

or compete for the business, Your Honor.

22

is that the law regulates the retailer and not the

23

carrier and, in doing so, similar to the situation in

24

Travelers, allows for a market to be created.

25

But the point

In particular, however, with respect to this
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

particular situation, Congress has spoken directly to it

2

and this Court has considered in the context of its

3

ERISA cases how Congress has dealt specifically with the

4

problem before the Court.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, we also

6

considered it in Morales, and I thought this law was

7

enacted in the immediate wake of Morales, which adopted

8

a much broader reading of "relates to" than the

9

subsequent ERISA cases.

10

MR. STERN:

We don't agree that it adopted

11

such a broad view because in Morales the Court was very

12

careful in the opinion to make clear that it was not

13

drawing a line which would bring potentially such laws

14

dealing with gambling or prostitution within the

15

preemptive ambit of the ADA.

16

respect to the FAA Act, particularly looking at the

17

legislative history, there is no indication that

18

Congress intended in any way to deal with the State's

19

controlling and regulating dangerous substances such as

20

tobacco.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Similarly, in -- with

But isn't that answering

22

the wrong question?

I'll be candid with you.

23

sure that whatever Morales-Travelers distinction there

24

is really counts here, because the issue here is

25

different from the issue in some of the -- in most of
5

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the preemption cases, because the issue here starts with

2

the, I think, the agreed assumption that Congress wanted

3

to end a certain category of regulation.

4

And the question is would Congress have

5

wanted, in effect, to permit a degree of State

6

regulation when it was for a particular purpose?

7

And the question then is not whether

8

Congress intended or had as an object when it passed

9

this statute an interference with the State's regulation

10

of juvenile contraband.

The question is whether it

11

intended to permit any regulation with respect to

12

delivery services to survive; and isn't that the tough

13

question that you've got to face?

14

MR. STERN:

Your Honor, looking at the

15

objectives of Congress as explained by Congress in the

16

legislative record, it's very clear that Congress was

17

concerned, the committee was concerned with, the

18

proponents such as the Federal Department of

19

Transportation, were concerned with the effects of the

20

particular category of regulation, State economic

21

regulation.

22

The United States -

23

The committee mentioned that nine times.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's because most

24

regulation, you know, has an economic purpose involved.

25

But the ultimate object, it seems to me, was to end the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

economic effects of State patchwork transportation

2

regulation.

3

And therefore I think the question you've

4

got to address is why would they have allowed a certain

5

category of regulation that clearly affects the way

6

these companies perform their services to survive solely

7

on the ground that the regulation was entailed at the

8

State level by the State's choice to go against youthful

9

tobacco use?

10

MR. STERN:

Well, Your Honor, we suggest

11

that the Court looks at the FAA Act and its legislative

12

history, as well as what immediately preceded it, which

13

was the Synar Amendment.

14

the States to deal with this problem.

15

Government -

16

The Synar Amendment encouraged

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The Federal

But the Synar -- I don't

17

have it in front of me, but the Synar Amendment refers

18

to -- to a number of objects of State legislation that

19

would be required, but it doesn't say anything about

20

regulating transportation.

21

MR. STERN:

It states quite clearly that the

22

intent is to encourage the States to prohibit -- or to

23

enforce/enact laws that prohibit retailers and

24

distributors from getting tobacco to children.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.
7


Alderson Reporting Company

And we don't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

normally think of a delivery service as a distributor of

2

goods.

3

statute meant.

4

I mean, we -- in the sense, I think, that the

I -- I read the Synar Amendment reference to

5

distributors as being wholesalers, people within the

6

industry who get the cigarettes from, you know, the

7

manufacturing point to the corner store, as opposed

8

simply to a delivery service that delivers all kinds of

9

goods.

10

MR. STERN:

Well, a sale consists of several

11

components, Your Honor:

12

Handing it over, handing the tobacco over physically to

13

the buyer, from the standpoint of the buyer's standpoint

14

and from the standpoint of public health perspective, is

15

the most important aspect of the transaction.

16

Order, payment, and delivery.

It is the seller who has the responsibility

17

to comply with the law with respect to each one of those

18

steps.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Stern, at the time

20

that the motor carrier deregulation came into effect,

21

were there any products where Maine told the retailer,

22

if you want to sell not face-to-face, you must choose a

23

carrier that will provide X, Y, and Z services?

24

there any -- is tobacco alone or were there other

25

commodities?
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Was

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. STERN:

Interestingly, there -- Maine

2

being a hunting State, there was a law on the books

3

which required the common carrier -- it specifically

4

referred to the common carrier -- to verify that the

5

person shipping it was the hunter with the appropriate

6

license, required the common carrier to affix

7

identification tags to the hunting -- the hunting

8

reward, so to speak, and also to make a return or

9

provide notice to the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries

10

and Wildlife.

11

So Maine had a variety of those sorts of

12

laws on the books that required carriers to actually do

13

something with respect to a particular type of

14

commodity.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does the Postal Service

16

adhere to -- or I don't know if the Postal Service is

17

used to ship cigarettes, tobacco products.

18

is, does the Postal Service adhere to Maine's

19

requirement?

20

MR. STERN:

But if it

Two points, Your Honor.

First,

21

the Postal Service has immunity from Maine laws.

22

second, the Postal Service, interestingly, does have an

23

addressee verification service for $4.10.

24

Why does the Post Office

have immunity from Maine laws?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

all sorts of stuff.

I believe there You could kill people and

I mean -

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. STERN:

I hope not, Your Honor.

But

6

with respect to a variety of civil regulatory matters, I

7

believe the courts have concluded that the United States

8

Postal Service has immunity from Maine -- from Maine and

9

other State laws.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it does -- you say

11

the Postal Service provides something that conforms,

12

that they have the -- you must deliver it to the person,

13

to the addressee herself?

14

MR. STERN:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is not

15

exactly conforming because -- it's sort of interesting.

16

Different carrier services or the Postal Service have

17

different sort of options that seem to make clear that

18

this is not a real problem to provide.

19

20

not an age verification service.

appropriately.

additional expense.

with the Postal Service loophole, Your Honor, and JUSTICE SCALIA:

government, that -- there's an effort to deal with that

19

problem.

21

well, first of all, we have no evidence with respect to

what this effect has had on FedEx.

opposite.

15

States can ban the transport and delivery of what we can

call unlicensed tobacco, tobacco from unlicensed

retailers, to unlicensed entities.

19

different licensees.

In addition, Respondents agree that States

tobacco or alcohol -

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
clear from their brief.

I thought that wasn't

I thought they had a footnote
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that said they weren't arguing the point in this case,

2

but I thought they didn't concede the total ban.

3

MR. STERN:

I believe if one looks at -

4

it's either page 24 or 44 of the brief -- they concede

5

that Maine and other States can ban the furnishing of

6

tobacco.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, they -

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They concede that they can

9

do it beyond the requirement, beyond the force of the

10

statute that precludes the knowing distribution.

11

other words, they -- they're not appealing the one

12

provision of subsection D that makes it a crime

13

knowingly to get the tobacco into the hands of minors

14

and so on, but do they concede anything beyond that?

15

MR. STERN:

In

I believe they do, Your Honor.

16

I believe -- I think it's at page 44 -- they concede

17

that Maine can ban the furnishing of tobacco by anyone,

18

including a carrier.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but I think that the

20

reason they make that concession is that they say you

21

must prove knowledge, and they're -- they're not

22

concerned about the -- about intentionally transgressing

23

Maine's law.

24

additional steps that you require them to go through to

25

make sure that there is no tobacco.

What they're concerned about is the

2

So they're not really worried about it so
long as you have a knowledge requirement.

3

MR. STERN:

Well, there is a knowledge

4

requirement in the first part of section 1555-D.

5

Your Honor's question gets right to the nub of the

6

problem with respect to the lower court's decision on

7

1555-D, which is:

8

about proving knowing delivery of an unlicensed product

9

such as this?

Well, you prove it without

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what the -- that's

And that's why they're not

worried about it, because it's hard to prove.

15

MR. STERN:

Without the evidentiary

16

assumption, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to

17

prove, which essentially makes the first part of the

18

court's decision with respect to 1555 -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

The answer to that is it

20

may be a very good idea, so convince Congress to pass a

21

law.

it's going to be a nightmare.

answer to that point is.

And I don't know what the answer to the
point is about banning things.

I'm amazed if that's

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what you mean.

2

North Carolina could pass a statute that says the

3

following:

4

say, or maybe everybody including small children -- I

5

don't know what they want to pass -- can smoke to their

6

heart's delight, can buy as many cigarettes as they

7

like, but you can't ship in a single cigarette from out

8

of State.

9
10

I'm not sure what you mean.

Everybody in North Carolina over the age 16,

You think that wouldn't cause -- raise a
Commerce Clause problem?

11

MR. STERN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

is written.

A Commerce Clause problem?
Yes.

It depends upon how the statute

If it banned JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's why I'm just

16

not certain about bans that forbid people to ship things

17

inside from outside the State, while allowing people to

18

buy those things produced by people inside the State.

19

That's why I'm uncertain about the concession you're

20

talking about.

21

MR. STERN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

Well I mean, what is this New

York law that does this?
MR. STERN:

The New York law banned the

delivery and sale of tobacco -- delivery and sales of
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cigarettes to B(2) -

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But isn't that the result

of a settlement?

4

MR. STERN:

The -- the law was -- existed

5

before the settlement, and the settlement which we have

6

referred to is a situation where UPS and a number of

7

other carriers have agreed to conform with it, Your

8

Honor.

9
10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And nationwide, not just

in New York; isn't that so?
MR. STERN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And it -- it

12

reveals, we think, that the -- that the nature of the

13

laws here are not so burdensome as to run afoul of this

14

Court's concerns -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, then, practically,

16

you don't have a problem with cigarettes because the New

17

York settlement takes care of it.

18

about other tobacco products?

19

MR. STERN:

You're just talking

Well, there are other tobacco

20

products, but in the New York settlement -- we can't

21

enforce the New York settlement, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We have

result of the New York settlement, carriers are no

cigarettes.

2

MR. STERN:

That is the intent of that, Your

3

Honor.

I'm not sure how effective it has been.

4

doing that, they have agreed and put in place a system

5

where tobacco products can only be shipped from a

6

licensee.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But by

But the thing I'm concerned

8

about is -- is assume it's perfectly legal to do what

9

you said.

I guess it still wouldn't be legal for Maine

10

or New York to say the following:

11

discourage people from smoking, a noble goal.

12

therefore, whenever an interstate shipper ships tobacco

13

into the State, he has to charge double the price, just

14

double the shipment price or ten times the shipment

15

price.

And,

Could they say that?

16
17

We really want to

MR. STERN:

That would seem to clearly run

afoul of the -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. STERN:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

-- Commerce Clause.
All right.

But could they

21

say you have to carry it in special packages which the

22

sticker -- which maybe you should do, but which the

23

sticker puts skull and crossbones on each of the

24

packages?

25

Could they say that?
MR. STERN:

I don't think 17

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. STERN:

3
4

No.

All right.

-- they necessarily could, Your

Honor.
JUDGE BREYER:

If they cannot say either of

5

those things because of the statute, why can they say:

6

What you have to do is you have to ship it in a way that

7

makes certain that the person who receives it, the

8

addressee, is the person who bought it?

9

MR. STERN:

The reason, Your Honor, is the

10

difference between the hypothetical you proposed at the

11

beginning of your question and what's going on in Maine

12

with respect to 1555-C(3)(C), which is a mouthful.

13

At the time the FAAA Act was enacted, it was

14

illegal for anyone to -- an unlicensed retailer, to sell

15

tobacco in the State of Maine, and it was illegal to

16

sell tobacco without verifying the age of the buyer.

17

That's the generally applicable law that was -- a

18

judicial sort of law that was on the books in 1994.

19

The skull and crossbones requirement is not

20

a judicial type of law, and what this Court has done in

21

the ERISA cases is look to see the -- the purpose and

22

type of law that is before it to determine whether it

23

was a type of law that was in existence and whether

24

there was any positive indication that -- that that sort

25

of law was supposed to be pre-empted or not.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Stern, can I ask you

8

this question:

9

tobacco problem or a broader problem?

Do you have other

10

products that are contraband such as -- or have special

restrictions on who can ship wild animals, prescription

12

drugs, firearms; or are there other products that you

any that we -- we regulate in the same way.

a ban on knowing transportation delivery, and said it

11

can't require -- on pages 26 and 27, it says it

12

different ways -- that if a liability standard of a

State is preempted, if, for example, it required

modification of the delivery methods, other than

declining the package; if in the normal course of the

MS. BRINKMANN:

What we are responding to is

10

the cert petition from the State here.

I would point

11

out that -- an example that the Court itself gave is

12

under their health and safety exemption, that means that

13

the State could come and just put a surcharge, whether

14

it would be on tobacco or junk food.

15

to draw between the position they take here and that

kind of situation.

17

of course, and the findings about the burdens on

because that statute is construed just as this is.

3

this very case, the Congress --

4

5

as a broad preemptive standard they intended apply here.

6

So we believe that that is the standard that should

really apply, but in light of the effect that this has

on the carrier services, we suggest it means any

up the C(3)(C), the provision which the State suggests

17

Solicitor General reads the statute anew and suggests

18

that there may be direct enforcement against the

that, because there is an instruction requirement that

the shipper give to the carrier and say, State law

mandates this.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,

10

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

11

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

12

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

13

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:

14

Thank you,

I think there's no question that the

15

State of Maine could not require carriers to obtain a

16

license to deliver tobacco products and condition that

17

upon the carrier's service complying with the mandates

18

of State law, that that would be a law that relates to

19

the carrier's service.

20

Now, Maine maintains that its law is

21

saved from preemption because of two distinctions:

22

it that is adopted with a health rather than economic

23

purpose, and because it operates directly on the shipper

24

rather than the carrier.

25

And we don't think that either of those

arguments is consistent with the text, structure, or

legislative history of the Act.

But I would want to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're talking about

the Federal act or the Maine act?

6

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

The Federal act.

7

That's right.

But it's worth noting that those

8

arguments, in any event, only go to the provision in

9

C(3)(C).

The provision that is under dispute in section

10

D does not have either of those characteristics.

11

operates directly on the carrier, and it is not adopted

12

for the health concern but rather to support the State's

13

licensing and tax purposes.

14

It

But if I could go back to the reasons why

15

their argument is inconsistent with the text, structure,

16

and history of the Federal act, as Respondents' counsel

17

noted, Congress did consider an alternative version of

18

this bill, one that was limited to economic regulation,

19

and the Congress rejected the Senate version and adopted

20

instead the House version that much more broadly

21

pre-empted State regulation related to carrier services.

22

It added the provision of services and adopted the

23

"related to" standard rather than regulation.

24
25

And so it has rejected this limitation that
Petitioners urge.

Moreover, the argument that there is
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a general health exception to the pre-emptive force of

2

the FAAAA is inconsistent with the structure of the Act.

3

There are specific exceptions in the Act related, for

4

example, to motor carrier safety, but those exceptions

5

correspond to other grants of authority to the Secretary

6

of Transportation to adopt regulations and to pre-empt

7

State regulations that would interfere with interstate

8

commerce or impose too much of a burden on interstate

9

commerce.

10

There is no similar back top, if the court

11

reads into the FAAAA a textual general exception for any

12

act adopted with a health purpose by the States.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

If one of the big carriers

14

decides for its own business purposes to offer a service

15

that complied with the Maine law, would that have the

16

effect of "un-pre-empting" the Maine law?

17

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, what Congress

18

-- what Congress had in mind in the Act was that

19

carriers would respond to the marketplace, not State

20

regulation.

21

response to the marketplace, for a State to dictate to

22

shippers that they should use one service as opposed to

23

another, we think would have -- it would be a different

24

analysis under Morales.

25

the test was whether there was a significant effect on

adult-signature-required service, for the -- for a State

that available service, that would not have much of an

effect at all on the carriers.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

no farther than the fact that the Federal government has

itself recognized the existence of that service and

required it in a law that relates to the shipping of

So the existence

Could I follow up on

Justice Kennedy's question, though, and specifically, do

you think the New York settlement, if the carriers did

not agree to it, that they would nonetheless prevail

because the terms of it are pre-emptive?

20

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

I have not studied

21

the New York statute sufficiently to speak to that, and

22

I don't think the government has a position about that.

23

We do believe -- the settlement agreement, though, is

24

distinct from the Maine law in some very significant

25

respects.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

And the most important of those is that

under the settlement agreement, the carriers agree to

use reasonable best efforts; whereas the Maine

the carrier to have knowledge -

MR. STERN:

Your Honor's question

raises two points.

11

if one goes and looks at the list of unlicensed tobacco

12

retailers, virtually all of them have something like

13

"tobacco" or "smokes" or something in it, because their

14

goal is to be picked up by a Google search for somebody

15

who is looking for cheap cigarettes and cheap tobacco.

16

With respect to the computer system -- and

17

the record is full of citations to it, for example, at

18

pages 92 and 95 -- they have done a study of their

the shipper -- not the shipper, of the transporter.

9

that -- so that your point that this is not a regulation

So

10

of -- of transport is simply -- is simply wrong as far

11

12
13

MR. STERN:

Do you acknowledge that?
Yes.

We made that point with

respect to 1555-C (3)(C).

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. STERN:

Okay.

With respect to 1555-D, it is a

16

direct regulation of the carrier services or any other

17

delivery service which we believe is called for and

18

permissible under the Synar Amendment, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Stern.
