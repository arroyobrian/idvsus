CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

next in case 06-1005, United States versus Santos.
Mr. Roberts.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Seventh Circuit misconstrued the Federal

11

money laundering statute by interpreting the term

12

"proceeds" to mean profits.

13

laundering of all the gross receipts of a crime, not

14

just its profits.

15

gross receipts, and the statutory context makes clear

16

that's the meaning Congress intended here.

17

is structured to prevent criminals from using the fruits

18

of their crimes to promote or to conceal their illegal

19

activities.

20

constrict the statute in ways that can't be squared with

21

that statutory objective.

22

The statute prohibits the

The primary meaning of "proceeds" is

The statute

But a profits definition of proceeds would

Because the word "proceeds" appears in

23

the introductory section of the statute, those kinds of

24

restrictions would apply to both concealment and

25

promotion cases.

For example, the statute wouldn't cover

2

expense payments that are structured to conceal the

3

unlawful nature and source of the funds involved.

4

means that if an illegal gambling operator recorded the

5

compensation that he paid his collectors as salary

6

payments by a legitimate business that he owned, that

7

that would not be covered under the statute.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. ROBERTS:

10

That

Where -- so what?

Well, Congress was trying -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is there some rule up there

11

that says every criminal statute has to cover as much as

12

possible?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

That's not

14

what we're arguing.

What we're arguing is that there is

15

no reason that Congress wouldn't have covered these

16

transactions and that they implicate the objectives of

17

the statute as revealed by its text, just as much as the

18

transactions that are clearly covered.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think it -- I think it

20

much more remarkable than that, more extraordinary than

21

that, that Congress would want to make all -- all

22

betting operations like this a violation automatically

23

of two criminal statutes.

24

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, Your Honor -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I find that sort of, you
4


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

know, very strange.

2

MR. ROBERTS:

-- it is certainly true that

3

illegal gambling and money laundering are going to occur

4

together, but that isn't a cause for concern.

5

reflects the fact that certain businesses, illegal

6

businesses like gambling operations, like drug dealing,

7

frequently generate large amounts of cash and they need

8

to launder that cash in order to survive and to prosper.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It just

It is hard to see this -

10

that, just in the sense of laundering, nothing is being

11

concealed.

12

to the runners and the collectors, it is an ordinary and

13

necessary expense of the illegal business.

14

They're not -- the money that's being paid

So I think Justice Scalia was emphasizing

15

that this is, for the very same conduct two discrete

16

statutes, one with much heavier penalties.

17

it odd, too, that the basic gambling statute has a lower

18

penalty than this money laundering statute, and yet it's

19

the same conduct that's violating both.

20

MR. ROBERTS:

That makes

Well, it's not the same

21

conduct in that the conduct here, the paying the winners

22

and paying the collectors is not a required element of

23

the gambling offense.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh well, I mean -- come on.

Nobody -- nobody runs a gambling operation without
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

paying off the winners.

2

long.

It's not going to last very

3

MR. ROBERTS:

And, true -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To make the paying off of

5

the winners a separate crime from running the gambling

6

operation seems to me quite extraordinary.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

It -- it -- it's true, Your

8

Honor, that they're not going to last very long.

9

They're not going to survive.

They're not going to

10

grow.

That's because they need to commit money

11

laundering in different ways to do that.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But even if -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you tell me what

14

happens if there's a -- two bank robbers, the one's with

15

the get-away car; the other one going into the bank

16

teller, and the robber that goes into the bank gets

17

$1,000 and comes out and gives 500 to the get-away guy.

18

Is that a violation of the statute?

19

MR. ROBERTS:

That is, if the -- if the

20

payment would promote the continuing -- if they've got a

21

continuing robbery operation and by paying him he's

22

going to say, he's saying, you know, keep on continuing

23

in the operation and let's expand it further.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then under your theory the

employee who gets paid shows up for work the next
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

morning; and so, of course, under your theory it would

2

be promotion.

3

MR. ROBERTS:

Your Honor, your question and

4

a lot of the questions I'm getting, I think express

5

concern about treating these transactions as promotion

6

under the statute.

7
8
9
10
11
12

But the question -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I would have the same

concern if we were dealing with concealment.
MR. ROBERTS:

What I don't -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If the robbery takes place

in a dark alley, is that automatically concealment?
MR. ROBERTS:

No, because what needs to be

13

concealed, what there needs to be is a financial

14

transaction that's designed, the transaction itself, to

15

conceal the nature and source of the proceeds.

16
17
18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's going into the alley

instead of doing it out on the MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think that doing a

19

robbery in the alley would be a financial transaction -

20

would be designing a financial transaction to conceal

21

the unlawful nature and source of the proceeds.

22

But if I can give you an example of -

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Roberts, isn't it true

24

that the problems that are being highlighted are

25

problems that result from expansive interpretations of
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other concepts that are not before us here, expansive

2

interpretation of promotion, expansive interpretation of

3

concealment?

4

The Seventh Circuit in the first appeal in

5

this case interpreted promotion very broadly.

6

I guess it felt that it had boxed itself in and that's

7

what led to this interpretation of proceeds.

8

interpret those other concepts more narrowly, you don't

9

have the same kind of overlap.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

And then,

But if you

I agree with that, Your Honor.

11

I was going to try to say to Justice Souter's question

12

before that if you have concerns that these kind of

13

expense payments should not be treated as promotional

14

money laundering, the way to address those is not by

15

adopting a profit construction of proceeds, because that

16

would do tremendous violence to the statute in other

17

ways.

18

And I do think that there are -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

20

qualification that Judge Easterbrook made when he said,

21

at least where the crime is a business-like operation?

22

He gave the example of gambling, he gave the example of

23

selling contraband.

24
25

And it seems to me that he was narrowing his
definition of proceeds to cases where the crime is not
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

robbery or a one-time event, but a business-like

2

operation.

3

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think it's difficult

4

to interpret the proceeds, the term "proceeds," to mean

5

something different for business operations than for

6

other crimes because it's the same word.

7

Your Honor, there are other ways -

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

continue.

I'm sorry.

But even so,

Why don't you

I didn't know you weren't done.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

I'm sorry.

11

Even so, there are other ways in which a

12

profits definition just makes no sense under this

13

statute, besides the numerous concealment transactions

14

that would be excluded that Congress would have no

15

reason not to cover.

16

applied to professional money launderers.

17

people who are hiding money for criminals as a matter of

18

their business.

19

money laundering, even if they knew that they were

20

concealing money that was generated by a Federal felony,

21

unless they also knew that the money was profits.

22

It also would make no sense as
Those are

Because they wouldn't be guilty of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

23

answer to the line of questioning that we were having

24

was that the problem would still be there, even if you

25

limited this statute to profits.

You take the two bank

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

robbers in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, the one that

2

robs the bank, the other in the get-away car.

3

the robber gave the money to the person in the get-away

4

car, he said, now, you know, I'm keeping $100 because I

5

had to buy the gun and that was $100, so you only get

6

400, so it's only the profits that they're splitting,

7

you'd have the same problem, wouldn't you?

8
9

MR. ROBERTS:

That's right.

If before

That's another

point, Your Honor, that a profits definition itself

10

isn't going to solve the problem of where the underlying

11

crime and the money laundering -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It will solve a lot them.

13

And unless you're willing to come in and say, yes, do it

14

to us, give us a narrower definition of concealment and

15

a narrower definition of what's a transaction, but

16

you're not willing to do that.

17

that as broadly as you can.

18

MR. ROBERTS:

You're going to stretch

It's not going to -- it's

19

not -- first of all, this case doesn't present the

20

interpretation of promotion and the Court would be free

21

to address that in -

22
23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Maybe the question

presented doesn't present it --

24

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I think the facts of

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the case do present it.

2

possible we could agree with you on the profits issue,

3

but nevertheless say this doesn't fit the promotion.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

I mean, it's theoretically

You certainly could, Your

5

Honor.

6

would be appropriate for you to rule on in this case,

7

because that issue was raised on direct appeal.

8

decided against Respondents by the -

9

But that would not be an alternative ground that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It was

I understand all that, but

10

we can still do it if it's perfectly obvious that that's

11

the right way to dispose of the case.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

You can obviously address any

13

issue that you want to, Your Honor.

14

rule is that issues that have been decided on direct

15

review shouldn't be relitigated on collateral attack.

16

The issue wasn't addressed by either of the courts below

17

in these collateral proceedings.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. ROBERTS:

But the ordinary

Wouldn't it be -

We do submit that it was

20

resolved correctly in this case, because, as the Seventh

21

Circuit held and as all the other courts of appeals have

22

held about promotion, the payments to the winners and

23

the payments to the collectors encourage the continued

24

participation of the collectors and encourage the

25

increased participation by gamblers.
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Roberts, the Seventh

2

Circuit in this case was following a precedent in

3

another case and it thought that the defendant was would

4

prevail under its theory.

5

If this Court should say that that theory,

6

that it's profits and not proceeds that matter, wouldn't

7

it be appropriate for us, if we don't decide the

8

question ourselves, to remand and say, Seventh Circuit,

9

your precedent was wrong; but you could consider a

10

question that was not necessary for you to reach because

11

you had your precedent on the profits issue?

12

MR. ROBERTS:

You could do that, but the

13

question that I think that is concerning the Court was

14

resolved by the Seventh Circuit in this very case on

15

direct appeal.

16

made by Mr. Santos that these transactions can't count

17

as promotional money laundering because they're

18

essential transactions of the business and that they

19

don't promote the carrying on of the business, and the

20

court of appeals rejected those arguments.

21

So on direct appeal, the argument was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You might well reject it if

22

you're going to have a narrow definition of proceeds.

23

mean, that rejection was connected with its acceptance

24

of a narrow definition of proceeds.

25

asking us to obliterate the latter, I don't know why it
12
Alderson Reporting Company

And if you're

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

isn't reasonable to send it back to the Seventh Circuit

2

and say, well, you still said the same thing if you came

3

out differently on the proceeds question.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we certainly would

5

prefer that you did that than that you interpreted

6

proceeds to mean profits because of the violence that it

7

would do to the remainder of the statute, Your Honor.

8
9

I was talking about professional money
launderers before and how they wouldn't be guilty of

10

money laundering if they were concealing money that they

11

knew that was generated by a crime.

12

there's no reason that Congress would have considered

13

those professional money launderers to be less culpable

14

merely because they might be laundering only illicit

15

receipts.

16

And Congress -

And It would be very difficult for the

17

government to prove that professional money launderers

18

knew that they were laundering profits because they

19

haven't participated in the predicate crime.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I've got that point, but

21

what is your suggestion as to how to deal with what is

22

underlying disturbing me and it seems like a lot of

23

others, if prima facie Congress did not intend that you

24

launder money where the activity is an essential part of

25

the underlying crime itself?

And there are three ways

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of dealing with that:

2
3

One is this gross receipts method, which has
the defects you mentioned.

4

The second is a definition of "promotion"

5

which says when you promote a crime that's different

6

from engaging in the crime.

7

And the third is sentencing; because it's a

8

real offense sentencing method and where what you've

9

done is nothing more than the underlying crime, the

10

sentence should be nothing more than the underlying

11

crime.

12

you're asking us to decide them piecemeal, yet they're

13

related.

14

I see three ways to get to the same problem, and

What do I do?
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think you decide the

15

question presented here and you decide that proceeds

16

means that -- that proceeds means gross receipts,

17

because that's the only meaning that makes sense with

18

the statute.

19

But the sentencing point you make is a very,

20

very good one, Your Honor.

21

Sentencing Guidelines were changed in 2001 to align the

22

punishment for money laundering when people participate

23

in the underlying crime much more with the punishment

24

level for the underlying crime.

25

And the fact is that the

And -- you know, in addition, as we know,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, and so courts

2

could certainly take into account concern about

3

overlap -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But still your answer

5

leaves me -- and I have no answer to this; I want yours.

6

I want you to see that I'm in -- at risk here as a judge

7

of getting whipsawed, that I first decide this case for

8

you; and the next case, all kinds of arguments appear

9

that I hadn't thought of; and then the third case,

10

again.

11

could look at the least evil way or the most efficient

12

way of achieving the congressional objective.

13

But if I could have them somehow together, I

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think that you can't

14

have all of them together, Your Honor, unfortunately.

15

But I do think that we would say that out of the three

16

that you raised, the best way to deal with concerns

17

about this would be in the sentencing context.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I find that extraordinary.

19

You really come in and say yeah, two crimes, assume

20

Congress meant ordinary gambling crime to carry with it

21

this other extraordinarily high penalty for the same

22

activity that involves the gambling, but don't worry

23

about it, we'll even it out in the sentencing.

24

I mean -- that's no way to run a railroad.

25

MR. ROBERTS:

It's not -- Your Honor, it's
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just not exactly the same activity, because people can

2

commit gambling without commit money laundering.

3

can be guilt of illegal gambling without being guilty of

4

money laundering -

5
6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They

Straighten that out in the

definition of the crime, rather than in the MR. ROBERTS:

But they can be -- even under

8

this definition, Your Honor.

In this very case there

9

were restaurant and tavern owners that permitted the

10

gambling bets to be taken on their premises because it

11

increased their -- the patronage of their businesses.

12

And they were convicted of participating in illegal

13

gambling operations.

14

laundering, because they didn't engage in a financial

15

transaction that's not an element of the gambling

16

offense, that involves the proceeds of the offense, and

17

that's intended either to conceal the proceeds -

18

They didn't commit money

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- Mr. Roberts -- that the

19

gambling offense is conducting a gambling business, so

20

it makes it -- it is not just the gambling itself -

21

MR. ROBERTS:

It is -- but the statute

22

defines what the three -- the statue defines what the

23

three elements of the gambling business are, Your Honor.

24

That it's illegal gambling that's illegal under State

25

law, that involves 5 or more persons, that it has 16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

continues for more than 30 days or has more than $2,000

2

in gross revenues in a day.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What continues?

The

4

business has to continue.

You are not engaging in a

5

gambling business if you're not paying off the winners.

6

That's all.

7

business.

That's not a good decent honest gambling

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. ROBERTS:

The gambling business -- it

10

might be gambling and fraud, Your Honor.

11

gambling business can continue for more than 30 days

12

without having paid the winners if they had a lottery

13

every month, and it was at the end of the month -- they

14

hadn't paid the winners yet, it would have gone for the

15

30 days, in a 31-day month without -- without having

16

paid the winners.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the

And -- if your definition

18

of proceeds is problematic, it is something like an

19

abstract question you're asking us to answer.

20

-- if we say well, we're not sure this is proceeds but

21

if it is proceeds, it is defined as gross receipts.

22
23
24
25

If this

That's an artificial context in which to
address the issue.
MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

I think that what

they're asking you to do is to interpret -- and what the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Seventh Circuit has done, is to interpret proceeds in a

2

way that makes no sense for the statute in order to deal

3

with these concerns about promotion cases that can be

4

dealt with in the other ways that Justice Breyer raised.

5

And there are really four -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Robert, may I go back

7

to something you said about -- of the options that

8

Justice Breyer mentioned.

9
10
11

You said the way to handle it is in
sentencing.
Santos was sentenced to 60 months on the

12

gambling counts and 210 months on the laundering.

13

said the statute has been changed.

14

sentence under the statute as it now exists?

15

is vastly disproportionate.

16

210 for money laundering.

17

MR. ROBERTS:

You

So what would be the
And this

60 months for gambling, and

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

I

18

probably should know the answer to what the precise

19

range would be under the guidelines.

20

what I do know is before, the way the guidelines worked

21

was that the base offense level for a money laundering

22

crime was not tied to the offense level for the

23

underlying offense.

24

23 for promotional money laundering.

25

Now, I don't.

But

So it was set I think starting at

But what happened in 2001 is that the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

commission changed the rules so that when you -- when

2

the money laundering involves the person who

3

participated in the underlying offense and has also done

4

the money laundering, you start with the offense level

5

for the underlying offense and then you make some minor

6

increases depending upon the type and the -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I have it in front of me

8

actually.

I was looking at it.

And it seems to me what

9

it assumes is that the underlying offense is different

10

from the money laundering.

11

rationale at all as to why this individual, if it's true

12

that he did nothing more than engage in the underlying

13

offense, why should he receive one day more than 60

14

months?

15

MR. ROBERTS:

And do you have any

Well, because he does engage

16

in something more than what he needs to do to be

17

punished for the underlying offense, and that conduct is

18

-- and that conduct is -- promotes ongoing crime or can

19

conceal ongoing crime in ways that are just what

20

Congress was getting at in the statute.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -

Because gambling under the

22

definition has the three elements that do not include

23

paying off the winners.

24

--

25

MR. ROBERTS:

That's what it all represents

Because -- well, that's one
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

thing, but the other thing is, Your Honor, if I could

2

talk about the ways that the proceeds definition just

3

doesn't make sense here.

4

the expense payments for instance, the payment of the

5

salary that Mr. Santos made to Mr. Diaz -- it happens in

6

this very case, although we didn't prosecute it as

7

concealment money laundering -- that he recorded those

8

payments as salary payments by a printing business that

9

he owned.

10

If these expense payments -

And he's doing that to conceal the activity,

11

to enable it to keep going.

12

Congress was trying to get in the statute.

13

covered under a profits definition.

14

concealed the gross receipts temporarily until they pay

15

the expenses -- for instance, if a gambling operator

16

takes the money that -- his illicit receipts from the

17

gambling, and he puts it in the bank account of the

18

printing business.

19

winning betters, he's doing that to hide it so the

20

gambling operation can keep going.

21

was trying to get at here.

22
23
24
25

And that's just what
Wouldn't be

If criminals

And then later he uses it to pay the

That's what Congress

That wouldn't be covered.

That -- that evades detection just as much
as transactions that hide profit.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

You are saying it would

not be covered as money laundering, but nevertheless it
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be illegal and be punished as gambling.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Roberts, isn't it true

3

that the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of proceeds

4

doesn't really solve these problems except in the case

5

of an unprofitable business?

6

profitable illegal enterprise, all of the same problems

7

exist.

8

MR. ROBERTS:

In the case of a

I think there are many

9

situations, as the Chief Justice pointed out, in which a

10

profits definition isn't going to be enough to solve it.

11

For instance, just a drug dealer accepts payment for the

12

drugs.

13

it would presumably be profit and without some other

14

requirement in the statute, it would count as money

15

laundering.

16

that are employed by a drug kingpin turn the receipts

17

over to the kingpin even after they've take out their

18

share, let's say -- under a profits definition if those

19

receipts exceeded the costs of the business that would

20

also be covered as money laundering.

21

very true that the profits definition isn't going to

22

solve all the problems as well.

23
24
25

If that money exceeds the cost of the business,

And for instance, when street-level dealers

8

Congress provided for the forfeiture of proceeds rather

9

They certainly don't keep records that are

And Congress recognized the lack of hard

10

And there's no reason to think Congress took a different

11

approach here in the money laundering statute, two years

12

later, when it used the same term "proceeds."

13

There's also -- there's the issue of the

14

uncertainty that would be created by a profits

15

definition, because it would raise all these questions,

16

and there are no accounting rules to resolve them.

17

And even the court below acknowledged that

18

it's difficult to determine what is and isn't net

19

income, and that the line between paying expenses and

20

reinvesting that income is murky.

21

And I don't think the Court should lightly

22

assume that Congress intended a definition of an element

23

of the offense that's going to raise these numerous

24

issues about the scope of that essential element of the

25

offense.

And the Court is going to have to resolve them

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. VARE

8

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

9
10

Thank you, counsel.

MR. VARE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Justice Ginsburg, you have suggested

12

correctly that the only conduct in this case was the

13

payment of ordinary and necessary expenses of the

14

business.

15

Justice Scalia, you correctly suggested that

16

paying off winners is necessary to every gambling

17

operation.

18

Justice Breyer, you have correctly suggested

19

and stated that the money laundering statute is intended

20

to punish different conduct, different criminal activity

21

than the underlying criminal activity.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Didn't Justice Alito

23

correctly suggest that these merger problems would still

24

persist even under your definition of "proceeds"?

25

MR. VARE:

I think that that is not

Alderson Reporting Company

necessarily true.

2

exist except for the "profits definition," certainly on

3

the facts of these cases -- on this case.

4

The merger problems would -- would

On this case the only facts that were

5

presented by the Government -- and they have conceded

6

that they did not present any evidence of profits.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but I mean if

8

you have a "profits" definition and the enterprise has

9

profits, all of these problems we've been talking about

10

in terms of the merger, as I call it, between the money

11

laundering and the underlying offense would still be

12

there, right?

13

MR. VARE:

Yes, Your Honor.

There would.

14

There would.

And, in fact, Justice Alito also correctly

15

suggested that the reason why the Scialabba panel

16

decided the "proceeds" definition is profits was because

17

of the expansive interpretation and application of the

18

other aspects of the statute, and that they were left

19

with essentially no choice.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So why are you urging us to

21

create two problems, to drag along all of the problems

22

that you object to with -- with interpreting proceeds to

23

include simply covering your expenses?

24

that the problems you point out would continue to exist

25

if we accept your definition.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

You acknowledge

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

On the other hand, I think you have to

2

acknowledge that accepting your definition creates other

3

problems of its own, such as the difficulty in every

4

case of showing that an illegal operation made a profit,

5

such as the difficulty of deciding what kind of criteria

6

you use for determining what are the -- what are the

7

ordinary and necessary expenses of a criminal

8

enterprise.

9

Why should we -- why should we choose to get

10

the worst of both worlds?

11

to attack the difficulty to focus in on what constitutes

12

a transaction and what constitutes concealment -

13

something other than the "proceeds" definition?

And why isn't the proper way

I think you're absolutely

15

correct, Justice Scalia.

17

made this very point as to why this was not the right

18

case to determine all of these issues, and particularly

19

the burdens that have been presented by the government.

20
21
22

And, in fact, in our

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did you argue at any point

that these were not proceeds?
MR. VARE:

Yes, Your Honor, we did.

23

Justice Kennedy, in the briefing in the opposition to

24

cert and in our response brief, we have set forth

25

distinct arguments that there are not separate
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

transactions distinct and different from the underlying

2

criminal activity.

3
4
5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did you argue that in the

court of appeals?
MR. VARE:

That was presented as -- that was

6

presented as part of the Febus decision as an argument

7

that those transactions did not constitute distinct and

8

separate transactions from gambling.

9

in the pro se petition and acknowledged by the

10
11

That was presented

government in responding to the pro se petition below.
The government acknowledged that the

12

question in Febus, the question in Scialabba, the

13

question in this case on habeas are legally and

14

factually indistinguishable.

15

Stevens has suggested that all of this is inherent in

16

the question presented.

17

And I think Justice

A fair -- it is fairly included because to

18

look at the statutory context of the word "proceeds" is

19

necessary for an intelligent resolution of the meaning

20

of that word as well as how it plays throughout the rest

21

of the statute.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

The question is can you

23

violate the statute by financial transactions which -

24

have you promoted the crime, when those transactions are

25

no more than part of the crime itself?
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

That's basically the question.

And I think

2

Justice Kennedy is asking if, in fact, we wanted to

3

reach that question, is this a case in which we could do

4

it, through reargument or in some other way?

5

MR. VARE:

I think that that is a question

that this Court could resolve on the facts of this case,

MR. VARE:

It is not our question presented, but we do feel that,

And there you don't have a different

Alderson Reporting Company

question presented.

2

MR. VARE:

No, we did not -- in the

3

opposition to the cert petition we did not present a

4

different question presented as a question presented.

5

But we did present the argument --

6

Mr. Santos did and Mr. Diaz did -- that there were no

7

separate transactions that promoted the carrying on of

8

the specified unlawful activity.

9

government had presented in this case was merely

10

Rather, all that the

conducting the illegal gambling business.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If we adopt your

12

position, we will have to decide a question like, for

13

example, if the argument is I didn't have any profits

14

because I had to pay $10,000 for a hit man to kill

15

somebody, we would have to have a judicial decision

16

that, yes, paying hit men is the ordinary and necessary

17

business expense in carrying out illegal gambling

18

operations, right?

19

MR. VARE:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, in

20

any case you're going to have to look at what the

21

specified unlawful activity is in the context of a money

22

laundering prosecution, because that is part of the

23

context.

24

And so in this case you have to look at what

25

is the ordinary conduct of an illegal gambling business.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And I would suggest that paying off a hit man most

2

likely would not fall into that category.

3

certainly, as many of the Justices, including Justice

4

Scalia and Justice Stevens and others have suggested,

5

that when a gambling business pays off its winners, that

6

is inherent -- that is integral -- to conducting a

7

gambling business.

8
9

But,

It is not -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Let's take two

illegal gambling operations that are identical in every

10

way except that the one pays the runners, you know, $200

11

a week.

12

the one that pays $500 doesn't make any profits because

13

he's paying too much to the runners.

14

The other pays the runners $500 a week.

And

The first one, the more successful

15

operation, you say, can be prosecuted for money

16

laundering because its has profits.

17

doesn't.

18

The other one

So incompetence is rewarded.
MR. VARE:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

I would

19

say that neither one could be prosecuted for money

20

laundering because in both situations -

-- when in both situations the

4

And that's part of the illegal

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I'm focusing on

5

the question presented -- that was the only question

6

presented when we considered whether to grant certiorari

7

by either of the parties, and that focuses solely on the

8

question of whether "proceeds" is considered gross

9

revenues or profits.

10

MR. VARE:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, what I

11

-- what I believe is the answer to your question is -

12

is you cannot look at the term "proceeds" in isolation.

13

And Justice Breyer, you know, suggested that the reason

14

why we're even here today, arguing about what I believe

15

is just absurd and unwarranted results on the facts of

16

this case, is because the courts below -- and the

17

government has proposed expansive interpretations -- the

18

courts below have adopted, in some cases and not others,

19

these expansive interpretations.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

But this doesn't -

21

"proceeds" must mean the same thing in every money

different in -- depending on the underlying illegal

activity?

4

MR. VARE:

I think there is certainly a

5

suggestion, but that this Court itself has made recently

6

in the Duke Energy case, that a term can have multiple

7

meanings, multiple shades of meanings, and that will

8

depend upon the context.

9

context and the specified unlawful activity is context.

10

So you have to look at the

Now, I'm not suggesting that we adopt a

11

definition of proceeds as net profits in one case for

12

one unlawful activity or gross profits for another

13

unlawful activity or gross receipts for another one.

14

But the problem that we have presented to us

15

today is due to the piecemeal construction and

16

application of this statute and -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Vare, you know, I'm -

18

I'm unwilling to decide the definition of transaction

19

question in the present case because, frankly, I think

20

that's a -- in itself, a very difficult question which

21

we haven't had adequately argued.

22

believe, as I've indicated earlier, that paying off the

23

winners is -- is an essential part of a gambling

24

operation, I don't believe that paying off runners

25

necessarily is.

For example, while I

You can have a gambling operation

without runners, can't you?

2

MR. VARE:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You can -

You could have You can -- you can view

4

that as something beyond the mere -- the mere gambling

5

crime.

6

paying off the winners is beyond the gambling crime, but

7

I do think having a bunch of runners and paying off each

8

of them is not necessarily part of gambling.

I don't -- I don't think you can view that

9
10

MR. VARE:

Well, you can have a gambling

business without runners per se.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. VARE:

Exactly.

But you do need, Justice Scalia,

13

you do need five or more participants.

14

likely going to get paid, and if they get paid, then

that is simply part of conducting an illegal gambling

23

I think the fact -- I mean, the fact that

would Congress ever have adopted a definition like that?
MR. VARE:

Well, Justice Alito, I don't

think it's an impossible situation, number one, and I'll

10

get to that in a second.

To address your first

11

question, could Congress have intended this to mean

12

profits knowing that the burdens were so difficult?

13

To answer that question, then you must look

14

at what else Congress intended, and there's no question

15

that Congress intended to punish different conduct than

16

the underlying criminal activity.

17

And then you have to look at what Congress

18

intended to get at when they wanted to fill the gap in

19

criminal law, when they want wanted to punish crimes

20

that were not previously punished.

21

They focused on getting at ill-gotten gains

22

of criminal enterprises.

They focused -- and our

MR. VARE:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm

not asking this Court to avoid any question.

What I am

10

saying is that there is a profits construction that if

11

you apply the traditional rules of statutory

12

construction, if you look at the text -- the word

13

itself, "proceeds," does not have a single plain meaning

14

as gross receipts.

15

multiple shades of meaning depending upon the context.

It is ambiguous.

There is, if you are going to go with

difficulties of working with a net proceeds, because we

don't know what the expenses that you would deduct, and

To figure out what would count to come up

with a net figure is the least difficult, is it not?

MR. VARE:

Justice Ginsburg, I think that it

11

is slightly more difficult in the case the government

12

has now, which is really no difficulty at all.

specified unlawful activity, what would be the ordinary

necessarily parlays into whether or not it is money
laundering or not.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. VARE:

No, I understand.

If, for example, the murderer

13

paid the hit man with money to kill somebody and then

14

paid -- you know, used proceeds from the insurance

15

premium that somebody might have been his wife or her

16

husband, and used the proceeds to pay off the money -

17

the hit man for the next crime or to reward him or

18

something else, to carry on the business or used the

19

insurance proceeds to conceal where they came from, then

20

I think you could create a hypothetical situation of

21

money laundering.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought it would

23

depend on whether or not the insurance proceeds exceeded

24

how much he had to pay the hit man, right?

25

he's not doing it to get the insurance money.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

right?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

He just wanted

5

to commit the murder, not get the money.

And so he pays

6

the hit man $100,000, he gets the $50,000, and then uses

7

it for all these other activities, you'd say no money

laundering, because no profits?

9

MR. VARE:

If we assume the expansive

10

interpretations of a transaction promoting the

11

underlying crime that have been presented in this case

12

and then we apply the profits definition, that might not

13

be money laundering.

14

is not designed to cure that evil.

It is punished as the underlying crime.

He didn't do anything else other than run a gambling

21

business.

22

And so I think the point is at the end of

23

the day, there are certainly a lot of hypothetical

24

situations that suggest a profits construction might

25

pose some burdens, might not make sense.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

But if you're

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to look at the burdens on the government in terms

2

of construing the term "proceeds," then you also must

3

look at the consequences of accepting the gross receipts

construction.

illegal gambling business into a money laundering

Under

I thought their

answer was the money laundering statute covers a whole

waterfront of activities besides illegal gambling.

15

the question is, what did Congress intend when they

passed the money laundering statute.

17

And

This is kind of the tail wagging the dog.

The tail is, well, it presents these problems when

19

you're talking about gambling operations, but there's a

20

whole rest of the dog area where it doesn't present a

21

problem.

22

MR. VARE:

Well, I think what the money

23

laundering statute was intended to do was punish

24

different conduct, separate and distinct from the

25

underlying crime.

And that different conduct is
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

inherent in conducting a financial transaction with the

2

intent to promote the carrying on of the unlawful

3

activity.

4

I do not think that you can parse the

5

statutory language and only address the term "proceeds"

6

irrespective of its consequences.

7

In fact, I think the questions directed to

8

me as to the harsh consequences on the government

9

approving profits shows that you have to look at the

10

term "proceeds" in its context.

In its context includes

11

not only the burdens on the one hand, but it certainly

12

includes the situation we have here, that every illegal

13

gambling business is automatic money laundering.

14

that is not what money laundering statute was enacted,

15

it's not what it was written or intended to address.
