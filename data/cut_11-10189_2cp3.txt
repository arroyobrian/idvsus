ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN A. WOLF

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WOLF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has

11

said, repeatedly, "As a general rule, a defendant should

12

not raise an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel

13

on direct appeal," and has recognized that Texas

14

procedure make it, "virtually impossible for appellate

15

counsel to adequately present such a claim."

16

claims are the choices made by the sovereign State of

17

Texas, and it renders this case just like Martinez.

18

Those

This case well illustrates the consequences

19

of that choice.

20

ready -- available for 7 months.

21

after the trial lost -- trial court lost jurisdiction on

22

any new trial motion.

23

The transcript in this case was not
That's 4 1/2 months

The State itself argued, quote -- in

24

Sprouse -- "Without access to that record, new counsel

25

would have little basis for attacking the performance of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 4

1

trial counsel."

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose the State's

3

position were not as you accurately have stated the

4

Texas Court of Criminal Appeal.

5

collateral review is the preferred route.

6

either way will do.

7

appeal, or you can bring it up on collateral.

8
9

It didn't say
It said

You can bring it up on direct

Would you say that Martinez applies in that
situation?

Or does it depend on having the -- the State

10

highest court in the matter saying, this is the

11

preferred way to go?

12

MR. WOLF:

Texas systemically channels

13

ineffective assistance claims to collateral -- to State

14

habeas.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if it didn't, if it

16

just said, you can bring it up on direct, but we realize

17

these limitations because the transcript won't be ready,

18

so you can wait and bring it up on habeas.

19

I'm just asking how far -- the rule that you

20

would like us to adopt -- you say this is just like

21

Martinez.

22

the -- the State's highest court has to say, we prefer

23

this matter to be brought up on collateral review?

24
25

Is that where you would draw the line, that

MR. WOLF:

It's not just them saying it in

words, but it's also saying it in the legislation and in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 5

2

the rules that the State of Texas has adopted.
In order to expand the record in a Wiggins

3

claim -- which is what's the basis of Mr. Trevino's

4

claim, in order to expand that record, you have a 30-day

5

window to file a motion for new trial, and 75 days --

6

75 days to have a hearing on it or else the court loses

7

jurisdiction by operation of law.

8

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The district court,

the trial court?
MR. WOLF:

That's correct.

And so you

11

couldn't expand the record.

12

Wiggins claim, especially, it takes a considerable

13

amount of extra record investigation.

14

And, in order to present a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Has the Texas --

15

have the Texas appellate courts ever sent a -- a claim

16

back for an evidentiary hearing?

17

MR. WOLF:

After 75 days, the -- the

18

district court loses jurisdiction, and I realize there

19

are some jurisdictions around the country that have that

20

opportunity.

21

provision to expand the record after that 75-day period.

22
23

But Texas has a finality where there is no

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So as far as you know,

the court -- the appellate court's never done that?

24

MR. WOLF:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct.
Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

Why does

Texas afford people in your client's position a new

appellate counsel?

3

MR. WOLF:

Well, there's two -- actually,

4

Texas has a dual-track system.

5

1995, a year before the Federal system was developed in

6

AEDPA.

7

rationale, was to expedite these type of claims,

8

especially in death penalty claims, under

9

Section 11.071.

10

It was developed in

And the concept -- and the reason for it -- the

But the -- and the purpose is that there is

11

two counsels that are appointed.

12

appointed to handle the record-based claims, and that's

13

done on direct appeal.

14

in all cases -- there's no question -- on habeas.

15

One counsel is

The other counsel is appointed

And that attorney -- that counsel is

16

appointed with the understanding that he's going to have

17

the time to do the extra-record-based claims.

18

like this, the record wasn't even prepared for 7 months

19

after the date of the judgment.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In a case

Counsel, I don't know

21

that you've answered Justice Ginsburg's question, and so

22

I'm going to take it up because it interests me.

23

Let's assume, as she did in her

24

hypothetical, that a State says -- doesn't have any case

25

law like Texas does, that says, we prefer you to go that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 7

1

way, for non-record-based claims.

2

Is the difference between that hypothetical

3

State that says, you can do either, and the Texas

4

situation, is that Texas, in your mind, puts up

5

procedural impediments to using the direct appeal

6

mechanism and so that, if the other State hasn't done

7

that, has made the development of evidence, has provided

8

a full opportunity for you to develop a record before

9

the direct appeal is over with, that State wouldn't be

10

subject to Martinez, and Texas is subject to it only

11

because it has the procedural impediments?

12

MR. WOLF:

That's correct because the -- the

13

scheme that Texas has developed systemically channels

14

the habeas claim, the IAC claim, the ineffective

15

assistance claim, into habeas.

16

that it could be done is really an illusion.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There is no -- to say

How -- how do you want us

18

to formulate the rule if we write the opinion in your

19

favor?

20

opportunity -- a feasible means for expanding the record

21

on direct review, then Martinez applies because it is

22

the collateral proceeding that is the meaningful one --

23

and then we go through 50 States to see if that rule

24

applies?

25

If a State does not give a realistic

MR. WOLF:

Well, it wouldn't really affect

50 States because some States provide a mechanism for an

2

abatement to go back on direct appeal and -- and expand

3

the record.

choice.

6

Other States require that it go to direct

And Texas has made a choice by developing

9

we would -- that would come out of this.

10

And as far as the other States, they would

This --

Well, I have the same

11

questions that my colleagues have asked.

12

us, in a sentence or two, the test that you would like

13

us to apply?

14

prohibit the raising of this issue on direct appeal,

Martinez, nevertheless, applies where the State does

Could you give

Fill in the blank.
MR. WOLF:

When it makes it impracticable,

18

in the vast majority of cases, to raise the claim on

19

direct appeal.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Impracticable, in the vast

21

majority of cases.

Now, that really would require a

22

case-by-case determination in every other State that

23

doesn't fall within the Martinez category, wouldn't it?

24

MR. WOLF:

Well, not necessarily --

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

No?

MR. WOLF:

You have to raise it on

direct appeal or it's lost.

You can't wait until

You get the same
Would that be

all right?

MR. WOLF:

No, because the new -- the old

4

position to understand his ineffectiveness.

5

disincentive for him --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

There is a

So you have the

7

same system where you get a new attorney, but you have

8

to comply with the time limits.

MR. WOLF:

10

And that --

JUSTICE ALITO:

And then you say, well, I

11

can't do all of this social background research that

12

Wiggins requires within the time limits, so that's

13

impracticable.

Is that State okay?

14

MR. WOLF:

No, because that's --

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

MR. WOLF:

That's not okay, either.

Because that State is -- in the

17

Texas scheme -- in the Texas scheme, the -- Texas gives

18

us another attorney in this dual track -- this system,

19

and it's understood that that attorney is the habeas

20

attorney.

21

limitation that the direct appeal attorney has,

22

that's -- that 75-day limitation.

23

And he doesn't -- he doesn't have that time

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is your point that he

24

has to have one full and fair opportunity to make the

25

Wiggins claim, and it doesn't matter whether it's direct

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 11

1

or collateral?

2

State requires you to do it on direct, but does provide

3

for developing the record.

4

I think you mentioned that at least one

MR. WOLF:

But the -- the bottom line in --

5

in our situation, in Texas, is that we have a scheme.

6

We have a set of -- of laws and -- and rules that

7

channel these type of claims.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

What are the rules other

than the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals having said, in

10

several decisions, the preferred route is collateral

11

review?

12

MR. WOLF:

Well, first of all, the -- the

13

Rule -- the Rules of Appellate Procedure 21.8 talk about

14

the limitations of -- the number of days that you have

15

to expand the record in a motion for new trial.

16

75 days, the -- the district court loses jurisdiction,

17

they cannot hear anything else on this case.

18

in this case wasn't even available for 7 months after

19

the date of the trial.

20

The record

So, even with a new attorney that's

21

appointed -- first of all, that new attorney is a

22

stranger to the case.

23

the case.

24

The client is not the best person to understand the

25

Rules of Appellate Procedure.

He doesn't know anything about

He's not in a position to talk to the client.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 12

So he's got to wait on that -- on that trial
record, first of all, to see what's there.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then --

I'm -- I'm not sure

4

exactly what Justice Ginsburg's formulation was, but I

5

didn't -- I don't understand why you didn't say, oh,

6

yes, that's right, there has to be one full fair

7

opportunity to raise the issue.

8

arguing here.

9
10

MR. WOLF:

12

I'm sorry if -- if I missed that,

but that's exactly the point.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
question is:

And that's what we are

And that's what -Then the next -- then my

Does this apply just to capital cases?

13

MR. WOLF:

No.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could we in a -- oh.

15

this doesn't apply just to capital cases, in your

16

opinion?

17

MR. WOLF:

Not necessarily.

So

But the -- in

18

the capital arena in Texas, we have the dual-track

19

system, where you get an attorney appointed

20

automatically in a habeas setting, where, in a non-death

21

penalty setting, there is a possibility of getting an

22

attorney in the interest of justice, but it's not always

23

guaranteed.

24

successive way, not in this dual-track way.

25

And, in that case, the appeal is done in a

And in -- in the death penalty arena, it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 13

1

manifests -- it makes it even more manifestly obvious

2

that there is a systematic channeling by the State

3

referring these type of claims into habeas, while the

4

State attorney, the district appeals attorney, focuses

5

on the record-based claim, and the habeas attorney is

6

dealing with all of the case, not just the trial, but

7

the -- the appeal, to make sure that there was no

8

ineffectiveness on his part, that -- and also to do the

9

investigation on the extra-record-based claims, which

10
11

takes a substantial amount of time.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, you -- you

12

started to answer this question, but it is something

13

raised by many of the amici opposing your position,

14

which is that, by adopting your position, we're

15

essentially having to examine the 49-plus -- because we

16

have territories that have collateral and direct review

17

as well -- plus systems to see which apply -- to which

18

Martinez applies and which -- to which Martinez

19

doesn't apply.

20

And so the question is:

How do we write

21

this to sort of give enough guidance, so that we're not

22

examining each of the 49 -- or 49 systems -- or maybe

23

48, after we've decided Martinez?

24

MR. WOLF:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.

Well, I would suggest -And -- and why should we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 14

1

not fear that outcome?

2

MR. WOLF:

Okay.

I would suggest the rule

3

to be that Martinez applies when a State channels

4

ineffective assistance of counsel claims to State habeas

5

and makes it impracticable in the vast majority of cases

6

to raise the claim on direct appeal.

7

And, in answer to your question about all of

8

the States, many of the States do make it -- do make

9

habeas available in the direct appeal arena.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it's --

So the reason why -- the

11

reason why there was a movement to channel ineffective

12

assistance of counsel claims to collateral review is

13

that it is often -- maybe in the great majority of

14

cases -- impracticable to adjudicate them on direct

15

appeal.

16

covers every State.

17

So, under your standard, it seems to me that

MR. WOLF:

Well, it wouldn't, Justice Alito,

18

for this reason:

19

the Texas scheme, which permits the expansion of the

20

record.

21

brief, has a Rule 21.3, which permits the claimant to go

22

back and expand the record.

23

ability in Texas.

24
25

Many States have a mechanism, unlike

Some States, like Utah, who authored the amicus

We don't have the -- that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, your friend

says, page 18 of his brief, that you do.

Alderson Reporting Company

He says,

Official
Page 15

1

"Under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 21, direct

2

appeal counsel can supplement the record with evidence

3

developed by investigators and experts, the ones that

4

are appointed and paid for by the State on appeal."

5

Now, is that just wrong?

6

MR. WOLF:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MR. WOLF:

9

Yes.
Okay.

And the reason I say that is, in

order to obtain a record, one, you need to -- when you

10

file your motion for new trial, you have to specifically

11

set out the factual basis for the claim; and, two, the

12

affidavit has to identify the evidence of any further

13

investigation would have revealed.

14

So you've got that 30-day window when you

15

file that motion for new trial that you have to do all

16

of those things, and that's not enough time.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if everything -- if

18

everything in Texas's system were the same, but you had

19

a year, would that flip Texas into a different category?

20

MR. WOLF:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22
23

If the -Is the problem -- is what

makes this impracticable just the amount of time?
MR. WOLF:

Yes, because the time -- the

24

time -- especially in a Wiggins claim, is prohibitive in

25

order to be able to prepare and -- not just the time

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 16

1

there, but the time that is imposed by the Rules of --

2

of Appellate Procedure.

3

That 75-day window, in order to expand the

4

record, is part of this whole system, that it's

5

understood that habeas claim is the -- the IAC claim

6

is channeled into habeas.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me try this one

8

more time.

You -- you seem to say, in your brief, that

9

the Kansas procedure and the -- the Michigan procedure

10

take those States outside of the Martinez category; is

11

that correct?

12

MR. WOLF:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Now, as I

14

understand the procedure in those cases, it is the

15

following:

16

motion for a new trial based on ineffective assistance

17

of counsel, and, if some threshold is met, the appellate

18

court can remand the case to the trial court for a

19

hearing on ineffective assistance.

On direct appeal, the attorney can make a

20

Is that correct?

21

MR. WOLF:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
Okay.

And that would -- in

23

most of those cases, the attorney on direct appeal is

24

going to be the attorney who represented the defendant

25

at trial and is probably not going to be in a very good

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 17

1

position to argue that he or she was ineffective at

2

trial, but that would still be okay?

3

MR. WOLF:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5
6

Well, but it's a -And if you don't do that,

you've lost it.
MR. WOLF:

Well, there's a problem with

7

declaring yourself ineffective.

One, it's -- it's kind

8

of counterintuitive.

9

ineffective, there's repercussions.

In Texas, if you declare yourself
You're no longer

10

available to -- you know, be taken off the list to get

11

appointments on these type of claims.

12
13
14

And -- and it's also against the Bar rules
to -- to have that adverse interest against your client.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, if that is the

15

system in Kansas and Michigan, then why -- why is it

16

outside Martinez, if the point is you can't effectively

17

present the ineffective assistance counsel when you've

18

got the same counsel who was alleged to have been

19

ineffective and is not going to condemn himself?

20

MR. WOLF:

Well, that -- as far as their

21

State -- you know, other States are concerned -- you

22

know, those are problems within those States.

23

far as Texas is concerned -- you know, we are in a

24

situation that we find ourselves in -- in a Martinez

25

situation, where there was no ability to -- to raise --

Alderson Reporting Company

But as

Official
Page 18

the system that we have prevents you from raising this

2

claim.

3

And, as far as the other States are

4

concerned, some of the States have a more liberal

5

opportunity to -- to expand the record, but that's not

6

the system that we have in Texas.

And this --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Explain why the time that

8

you have on direct appeal isn't adequate.

9

you need -- need to investigate.

So you say

Well, some of the

10

things, like school records, his prison records, it

11

doesn't take a long time to get those, does it?

12

MR. WOLF:

Well, it -- it takes a while.

13

I'm not going to say a long while, but releases are

14

required.

15

those records.

16

problem is getting the record, is also, in our

17

situation, to have Mr. Trevino evaluated regarding

18

his -- there was never a psychological or sociological

19

study done in his case, and to have a psychological eval

20

done, that doesn't happen in 30 days.

Sometimes, there's opposition to releasing
But the biggest part of -- of this whole

and, in some of these situations, one record leads to

23

another record, finding one witness leads to another

24

these other avenues and when you put all that together,

And, by the time you start developing all

then you're in a position to present that to an expert,

2

in order to make that sort of evaluation.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, surely --

4

surely, the trial court in Texas, when it gets a new

5

trial motion within 30 days, and the new counsel on

6

appeal says, well, I have reason to believe -- well, we

7

can see that there wasn't an adequate investigation of

mitigating circumstances or whatever made below, and I

would like the time to conduct -- you know, the

psychological evaluation or to contact these witnesses,

11

is the trial court going to say no?

That's all he

And while -- and that's why, in Texas, where

20

you have this dual-track system in order to expedite the

21

appeal, there is a new attorney that's appointed to do

22

the habeas work.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And because of the rather

24

sharp disagreements in the briefs on what the actual

25

facts are here, I looked at the brief filed by the State

Bar of Texas in support of neither party.

2

Can you tell me -- and that they are

3

critical of having new counsel work simultaneously on a

4

simultaneous timeframe concurrently with the -- with the

5

new direct appeal counsel.

6
7

Can you tell me how anything that's said in
the Texas Bar briefs helps your case?

8
9

MR. WOLF:

Well, it helps our case because

it recognizes the dual-track system, and it recognizes

10

that the extra record under Section 12.22 of the

11

guide -- of the Texas guidelines that -- that were

12

formulated that the State Bar was -- one of their

13

committees on indigent defense helped develop.

14

They recognize the fact that extra record

15

investigation is the responsibility of the habeas

16

counsel.

I would like to reserve the balance of my
time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. OLDHAM

22
23
24
25

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. OLDHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Texas's procedures for raising

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 21

1

ineffectiveness claims are some of the most generous in

2

the country.

3

bites at the apple.

4

Those procedures offered Petitioner two

The first bite came in a constitutionally

5

protected direct appeal proceeding.

6

in that proceeding would have been the source of cause

7

under existing cause and prejudice standards to excuse a

8

subsequent default.

9

And any deficiency

Allowing the Petitioner to assert cause on

10

the basis of a second bite at the apple -- that is, a

11

State habeas proceeding -- would create an unwarranted

12

and unworkable extension of Martinez.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is it a second bite

14

when the Texas Supreme Court -- court of criminal

15

appeals, has said, again and again, as a general rule,

16

defendants should not raise ineffective assistance of

17

trial counsel on direct appeal, should raise it on

18

collateral review?

19

MR. OLDHAM:

Justice Ginsburg, the very next

20

sentence of that opinion, Mata v. State, states that the

21

lack of a clear record, usually, will prevent the

22

appellant from meeting the first part of the Strickland

23

test as the reasonableness of counsel's choices and

24

motivations during trial can be proven deficient only

25

through facts that don't normally appear in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 22

1

appellate record.

2

So the only question presented by those

3

instructions that are quoted over and over again in the

4

Petitioner's briefs is whether and to what extent

5

newly-appointed counsel -- as Justice Alito was pointing

6

out, Texas provides newly-appointed counsel on direct

7

appeal in capital cases -- can supplement the appellate

8

record with an explanation from the trial -- trial

9

counsel.

10

And where the new counsel gets an

11

explanation of the strategies of the trial counsel, the

12

record is then complete --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't -- does the

14

statement "defendants should not raise ineffective

15

assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal" doesn't

16

mean what it says?

17

MR. OLDHAM:

Oh, yes, ma'am.

It does mean

18

that.

It's just that what -- what the Court is

19

saying -- the very next sentence following the ones that

20

are quoted in the Petitioner's brief, says, "The reason

21

that one should not raise an issue of ineffective

22

assistance of counsel on direct appeal is because, in

23

cases where there is no explanation from the trial

24

counsel, it will be impossible to adjudicate the first

25

prong of the Strickland test."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 23

1

It doesn't say that, as a general rule, you

2

should just never do it.

3

actually going to raise a claim of ineffective

4

assistance, you should create the proper record before

5

you do it.

6

It just says, if you are

And -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then -- but the

7

comment is that the record has to be done within a very

8

short period of time, and the -- and the trial record

9

isn't even available for -- the transcript, for some 7

10
11

months.
MR. OLDHAM:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, and that

12

is why Texas has a procedure for abating and remanding

13

appeals that is material identical to the one that

14

Kansas provides and the Petitioner concedes is

15

sufficient to satisfy this Court's inquiry in Martinez.

16

So the way that the procedure in Texas would

17

work, as it does in Kansas, is that the newly appointed

18

direct appeal lawyer -- who has no conflict and is,

19

therefore, free to accuse trial counsel of being

20

ineffective -- would file a motion to stay the appeal,

21

abate it, and remand it to the trial court.

22

The showing in both States is roughly the

23

same; it's a facially plausible claim of

24

ineffectiveness.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the new counsel on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 24

1

direct waits for 7 months, gets the transcript.

2

meantime, let's assume has made some investigation, and

3

he said -- and he tells the appellate court, we have

4

some very important material that we want to introduce

5

and we need to supplement the record; please remand this

6

case.

7
8

MR. OLDHAM:

Yes, Your Honor.

In the

And one

point --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That -- that has never

10

happened in the State of Texas in a capital case, I take

11

it?

12

MR. OLDHAM:

I'm not aware of a capital

13

case, but it has been done in many, many noncapital

14

cases.

15

specifically blessed it, especially -- particularly in a

16

case involving a Wiggins type ineffective assistance of

17

counsel at punishment phase.

18
19
20

And the Court of Criminal Appeals has

That is a case called Cooks v. State.

cited on pages 32 and 34 of our brief.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

wrong, the circuit that ruled in favor of Texas, but

22

said, in the Ibarra case, the Texas Court of Criminal

23

Appeals has made it clear that State habeas petitions --

24

and the State habeas petition is the preferred vehicle

25

for developing ineffective assistance claims?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

Was that wrong?

2

MR. OLDHAM:

I believe it just needs to be

3

taken in the context of -- it is the preferred vehicle

4

if you have not developed the record to bring a claim --

5

or to bring a claim appropriately on direct appeal.

good-faith basis for a claim?

20

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

21

many -- many prisoners in Texas, in capital and

22

noncapital contexts alike, have done that within the

23

30 days, but I want to emphasize --

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How many were given an

indefinite stay until they got the trial record to set

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 26

1

forth the affidavits?

2

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, if it's done within the

3

first 30 days, you don't need a stay, indefinite or

4

otherwise.

5

You can just file -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what do you do with

6

the 75-day rule, which I think is absolute, which says,

7

if the court hasn't ruled on the new trial within

8

75 days, the matter ends?

9

MR. OLDHAM:

I think the easiest way to

10

think about it is there are basically three stages.

11

There is the first 30-day window, and, as I say, many

12

capital and noncapital prisoners have effectively

13

brought their claims in that 30-day window.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That assumes you get the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, the 75 days has

12

MR. OLDHAM:

And then, after that, there is

13

no briefing that has been done in the appellate court at

14

this point because the appellate briefing schedule and

15

the transcript production are tied to one another, so it

16

would never be a case where you're actually litigating a

17

direct appeal without the transcript.

19

You -- the latter

And, at that point, you can make a motion to

21

fair, he still has to show to the Federal habeas judge

MR. OLDHAM:

Mr. Oldham, do we have a

clue, Mr. Oldham, if the information is correct, that

20

direct appeal counsel in the county involved here gets

21

a very limited amount of money -- gets, they said it's

22

$1,500 fixed fee.

23

But, if counsel who's appointed as

24

collateral review gets $25,000, doesn't that suggest

25

that the -- that the counsel on direct appeal is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 33

expected to deal with trial errors and the one that gets

2

all this $25,000 can go out and find a psychologist, a

3

5

MR. OLDHAM:

No, Your Honor.

And that is

6

because the funding thresholds that are cited for the

8

One is those -- those only came into effect after the

9

filing of the State habeas and after the filing of the

10

direct appeal in this case.

11

But the second -- and perhaps I think more

12

relevant sense in which they're wrong, is that those

13

apply to the amount of money that are given to the

14

lawyers; whereas the subsection (l) provision that we've

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but you -- you say

2

it's before, but this -- this indicates how Texas views

3

its system.

4

views this system as being one in which the collateral

5

appeal -- or the collateral proceeding counsel is in the

6

best position to raise IAC claims.

7

And, as Justice Ginsburg indicates, Texas

That's -- that's just where it is.

And

8

the -- the State Bar says -- agrees with the

9

Respondent -- pardon me -- with the Petitioner on this

10
11

point.
MR. OLDHAM:

Justice Kennedy, the court of

12

criminal appeals has said that the -- that claims of

13

ineffective assistance of trial counsel properly can be

14

brought on direct appeal.

15

The Texas State legislature has said it by

16

authorizing a new direct appeal attorney and stating,

17

throughout the legislative history -- and I think in the

18

text and structure of the statute -- that they intend

19

for these claims to be able to be brought on direct

20

appeal -- not that they are channeled on direct appeal;

21

they're not channeled either way.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, able -- able to be

23

brought, Mr. Oldham, but, as Justice Ginsburg started

24

off by saying, many times, the court of criminal appeals

25

has said the preferred mechanism is to bring it on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 35

1
2

collateral appeal.
And, more to the point even, when attorneys

3

try to bring these kinds of claims on a motion for a new

4

trial, the typical response is to say, no, this is not

5

the proper venue for that, go back and do it again on

6

collateral review.

7

So we have -- you say that there's a formal

8

mechanism that could be used.

But it seems as though

9

the courts and the lawyers, both, in Texas, are being

10

told continually, don't use that formal mechanism;

11

instead, do this on collateral review.

12

MR. OLDHAM:

Justice Kagan, I am aware of no

13

case where someone's brought a new trial motion that --

14

in the procedurally proper way -- and been told not to

15

do it that way.

16

I think what we --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, isn't the usual

17

response just to dismiss it without prejudice and to

18

say, we don't have time to deal with this, go away, come

19

back again on collateral review?

20

MR. OLDHAM:

No, Your Honor.

That's --

21

that's the usual response when the record is

22

insufficient.

23

given your trial lawyer --

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

That is, when you haven't -- you haven't

Well, because, mostly, the

record isn't sufficient for a Wiggins claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

So anytime

Official
Page 36

1

somebody brings a Wiggins claim on this 30-day window,

2

the Court says -- you know, there's only 30 days, the

3

record is insufficient.

4

MR. OLDHAM:

Go away, do it again.
Your Honor, that's not what

5

happened in the Armstrong case, where someone brought a

6

Wiggins -- it's not what happened in the --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's your one case, it

8

seems to me.

You only have one case.

It's Armstrong.

9

Armstrong seems to me sort of like proof as to why it is

10

that the Texas courts don't do that generally because

11

what they did in Armstrong was they ended up trying to

12

adjudicate that on the merits and realizing that there

13

was -- that the record wasn't sufficient.

14

MR. OLDHAM:

Your Honor, it's -- it's not

15

the only case -- a similar claim was raised in the

16

Motley case, which was cited in our brief.

17

also raised in a Rosales case, also cited in our brief.

Similar Wiggins kinds of cases.

23

more generous than a lot of the States in the country,

24

25

Do you agree, Mr. Oldham,

that, if you didn't have the mechanism for a new trial,

2

then you would form under the Martinez rule?

4
5

MR. OLDHAM:

With no new trial and no

standing abatement?
JUSTICE KAGAN:

In other words, no

6

opportunity for factual development.

7

MR. OLDHAM:

If there was no opportunity to

8

develop -- to develop the facts and there was

9

practically no opportunity to -- to raise the claim on

10

direct appeal, I think the question would still turn on

11

whether and to what extent there was a constitutional

12

right to have an effective appeal of that issue.

13

And the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has

14

afforded constitutional protection to that new trial

15

window and to the meaningfulness of the record necessary

16

to raise these claims on direct appeal.

17

that is what is sufficient to move this case out of the

18

Martinez box and into the normal cause and prejudice

19

standards that this Court applies --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I think

Can I -- can I go back

21

to what you are proposing, okay, and what you are saying

22

this system stands for?

23

counsel claim is brought on direct appeal, with or

24

without a record -- court says, we don't have a record,

25

it throws it into collateral review, as I have seen it

If an ineffective assistance of

that Martinez applies?

If it happened in every single

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, forget it -- that --

when it happens?
MR. OLDHAM:

Oh, no, Your Honor.

I don't

think that Martinez would apply in that circumstance.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.

So they haven't

13

gotten a full and fair opportunity because they've

14

presented their case, but Texas has said, we don't want

15

to do it here, do it there.

16

Martinez doesn't apply?

17

MR. OLDHAM:

You are still saying

Precisely, because there is no

18

default upon which to apply Martinez, so there's

19

nothing -- there is no work for Martinez to do in that

20

hypothetical, precisely because the claim can be met --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So because it can, but

22

Texas chose not to, now there's no protection, there is

23

no full and fair opportunity for the petitioner to have

24

had that claim adjudicated?

25

That's really the end result of what you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 39

saying.

2

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, I'm certainly not

3

suggesting that the rule needs to turn on the

4

meaningfulness of the opportunity to raise it on direct

5

appeal.

6

said -- whether it's a complete --

I think that Martinez was very clear when it

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

State said, well, go to collateral review.

9

saying, no -- no Martinez protection?

10

MR. OLDHAM:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You raised it, and the
You're

Well, I don't -Your counsel was

12

ineffective in habeas in that -- in State habeas, you --

13

you can do nothing about it.

14

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, you don't -- there's

15

nothing to do in the sense that, in that very

16

hypothetical, that very claim could be raised in State

17

habeas the first time, but it also could be --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's clearly no Martinez

19

protection.

The question you are being asked, I think,

20

boils down to whether we should develop a new case,

21

Martinez plus, in which -- even though there is,

22

technically, the ability to raise it, which is all that

23

Martinez spoke about, the mere fact that the ability to

24

raise it is not effective enough should produce the same

25

result that Martinez produced.

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 40

I don't think there is any -- I'm not even

2

sure the other side claims that Martinez said what --

3

what he is arguing here.

4

MR. OLDHAM:

I think that's exactly right,

5

Justice Scalia, and, in the hypothetical that Justice

6

Sotomayor was asking, the court's ordinary cause and

7

prejudice standards would accommodate for that.

8

would be no inequity for the court -- for Martinez to do

9

anything.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

There

What happens -- imagine we

11

have a State supreme court, and it says, okay, you could

12

raise this claim on appeal, we don't advise it, we

13

think -- it's so much easier to do it in State habeas.

14

Please do it in State habeas.

15

binding, but do it.

16

Okay?

It's not absolutely

That's what they are saying.

Now, he raises nine of his ten ineffective

17

assistance of counsel claims in State habeas.

18

State habeas court says, no, you are out on all nine,

19

but he never raised the tenth.

20

And the

Now, we are in Federal court, and the

21

prisoner says -- you know, that tenth claim is fabulous.

22

And the judge says, it is substantial.

23

know why it wasn't raised before?

24

was incompetent on State habeas, and they didn't raise

25

it on appeal because that's just how people normally do

And he says, you

Because my counsel

things in Texas, they don't raise it on appeal.

2

wait until State habeas.

3

They

Has that person had a full and fair

4

opportunity to raise this tenth claim in the State

5

court?

6

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, if the -- if the Court by

7

hypothesis is telling the Bar not to bring claims under

8

any set of circumstances on direct appeal, I think

9

that --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

They are not saying never.

11

They are just saying it works so much better.

12

say is we appoint State habeas counsel at the same time,

13

it's easier to develop it.

14

We'll just say hardly ever.

Please.

What they

We won't say never.

15

Now, what's -- what is the -- what is your

16

view about whether that person has had a full and fair

17

opportunity to develop his tenth ineffective assistance

18

claim in the State courts.

19
20
21

MR. OLDHAM:

Justice Breyer, Martinez should

not apply, even to that hypothetical.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not even thinking about

22

Martinez at the moment because I don't want to get into

23

whether it is an extension or just an elaboration or

24

just a situation covered, but they didn't think of it or

25

just a lot of other things.

I just want to know, given Martinez, what do
you think?

MR. OLDHAM:

I'm not sure how to answer the

full and fair opportunity question because that --

5

that's certainly not the standard that we are advocating

6

here.

7
8

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the standard you

are advocating?

9

MR. OLDHAM:

We believe that Martinez

10

applies where it said that it applies, and that is where

11

a State makes a deliberate choice to disallow all claims

12

on direct appeal.

13

a Martinez clause to apply to an eventual default.

14

We understand the necessity to having

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if, in fact, they say,

15

yes, there is a route, never used, but once, filled with

16

minefields, very hard when compared with the other one,

17

there you say, it isn't Martinez, it is a totally -- it

18

is a new thing because Martinez, after all, had no

19

rationale.

20

MR. OLDHAM:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

but I don't mean to be.

23

to get to?

24
25

Your Honor, I think -I'm being sarcastic there,

I mean, you see what I'm trying

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was the nose of the

camel, which is what Martinez was -- which is what the

dissent said, actually.

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

Yes, the dissent said that.

This is -- this is very

amusing in a capital case.

7

Let me ask you this question:

Is there

8

anything in the State Bar brief that substantially helps

9

your position?

I'm -- I'm very interested in the State

10

Bar brief.

11

say there is a conflict of interest in -- between the

12

habeas counsel and the -- and the counsel on direct.

13

It's a little hard for me to parse.

It did

And it also -- it also indicates that the

14

habeas counsel has to file the application in the

15

convicting court not later than 180 days after -- or not

16

later than 45 days after the State's original brief,

17

which seems to help the Petitioner here because the

18

original brief in -- in the direct appeal proceeding is

19

deemed important for the habeas counsel.

20

MR. OLDHAM:

Justice Kennedy, I don't think

21

there is anything in the State Bar brief that helps

22

either side in this sense because the State Bar agrees

23

that there were no relevant guidelines of any kind at

24

the time of any of the proceedings in this case.

25

The only guideline that any Bar association

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 44

1

had promulgated at the time of the direct appeal

2

proceeding or State habeas proceeding in this case was

3

the 1989 American Bar Association guideline, 11.9.2,

4

which specifically told the direct appeal lawyer in this

5

case to raise every colorable claim he could, regardless

6

of any State procedures to the contrary.

7

And, if he had raised a substantial Wiggins

8

claim or if he had even tried his best to raise a

9

Wiggins claim that could be -- could be amplified and

10

further developed on State habeas, we wouldn't be

11

standing here today because it would have been properly

12

exhausted and adjudicated on the merits in State court.

13

So I don't think that the Bar association

14

really has anything one way to say or the other, which

15

is maybe why it filed on behalf of neither party.

16

But to return to Justice Breyer's question,

17

I don't think that what -- what we're talking about is

18

to come up with anything new.

19

talking about in this outside-of-Martinez world is

20

actually very old.

21

Carrier rule, the normal rule that applies to cause and

22

prejudice for all defaults in States across the country.

23

I think what we're

We are just talking about the

And I think that the best way to understand

24

it is to imagine, in the very hypothetical that you

25

offered, where there is just one person who could get

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 45

1

through, that person would have a constitutional claim

2

in the State of -- I'm sorry, the other 900 or however

3

many there were, those people would have constitutional

4

claims in the State of Texas for the deprivation of a

5

meaningful opportunity to press their claims on direct

6

appeal.

7

And as from the Federal -- and that would

8

serve as cause, if the State courts denied it, that

9

would serve as cause to overcome a default in Federal

10
11

court and to get an adjudication of that claim.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Oldham, I had thought

12

that Martinez was really an equitable rule.

13

equitable rule about giving people an opportunity to

14

raise a trial ineffectiveness claim.

15

It was an

And if it's true that, although Texas has a

16

technical possibility of doing that outside of

17

collateral review, but, in fact, that the lawyers are

18

told not to use that route, that the lawyers don't use

19

that route, that, if they do use that route, the

20

likelihood is that they will be thrown out for using

21

that route, the question is why that -- the formal

22

availability of a mechanism that nobody uses and that

23

everybody is told not to use should matter with respect

24

to the application of an equitable rule like Martinez?

25

MR. OLDHAM:

Justice Kagan, there is no work

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 46

1

for an equitable rule in Martinez to do if you can get

2

there another way.

3

it on direct appeal, it's also that, if your direct

4

appeal lawyer doesn't do it, you can, under certain

5

circumstances, establish cause against your direct

6

appeal -- direct appeal lawyer to overcome an ensuing

7

default.

8
9

And it's not just that you can raise

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has there ever been such

a case, any case in which a direct appeal counsel has

10

been held ineffective for failing to present a Wiggins

11

claim?

12

MR. OLDHAM:

I'm not sure about specifically

13

Wiggins claims, but, yes, it is, in fact, established in

14

the leading treatise on Texas practice cited by both

15

sides that is ineffective assistance of appellate

16

counsel to fail to develop the record to allow any claim

17

to be adjudicated on direct appeal.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I asked, if there was

19

any decisions that says, you should have raised it on

20

appeal, appeals counsel didn't rely on the advice of the

21

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and, therefore, because

22

counsel followed the advice of Texas Court of Criminal

23

Appeals, she was ineffective?

24
25

MR. OLDHAM:

No, Justice -- Justice

Ginsburg, I am not aware of any particular case on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 47

1

Wiggins in particular.

2

appellate ineffectiveness for failure to raise a claim

3

on direct appeal are -- are raised and adjudicated on

4

the merits all the time in Texas courts.

5

But -- but claims against

And there are specific ones that say that

6

ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to fail to

7

develop the record using the procedures which the State

8

has allowed through the new trial window.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the -- the Texas

10

Court of Criminal Appeals, in addition to saying, as a

11

general rule, bring it up on -- on collateral review,

12

said -- and there's a reason.

13

undeveloped record on direct appeal would be

14

insufficient to establish claims that must be supported

15

by extra-record evidence.

16

The reason why is the

So that seems to be an expectation that

17

extra-record evidence will be developed on collateral

18

review, not direct appeal.

19

MR. OLDHAM:

No, Justice Ginsburg, I think

20

it's an expectation that the extra-record evidence will

21

be developed, either through the new trial proceeding,

22

through a factual proffer following it, or through a

23

stay and abatement procedure, to make sure that, when

24

the claim actually gets to the court -- the court of

25

appeals, that it has a record upon which to adjudicate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 48

1

the claim.

2

That's all that -- and, to the extent that

3

the appellate lawyer fails to do that, that can

4

constitute cause under the ordinary rules of cause and

5

prejudice without creating another Martinez exception,

6

which we would submit is going to be highly, highly

7

unworkable, given that the court is going to have to

8

determine when is a little bit enough and when is not

9

enough sufficient for Martinez.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

The Respondent says that the

11

Kansas and the Michigan procedures are sufficient to

12

take the case -- to take the States outside of Martinez.

13

You say your stay and abate proceeding is the same,

14

essentially, as those procedures.

15

His response is that Texas has used this

16

remedy in only one situation, and that is when a

17

defendant is deprived of counsel during the new trial

18

window and suffers prejudice from the deprivation.

19

Now, is that correct.

20

MR. OLDHAM:

It's when the counsel -- when

21

the prisoner has suffered a deprivation of the

22

opportunity to develop the record in the new trial

23

window.

24

there was only a lawyer for 10 of the 30 days, and

25

the court said the new trial window is a critical stage

So, in the Cooks case, for example, that was --

Alderson Reporting Company

for the development of a particular record for raising

2

a Wiggins-style claim on direct appeal, and because that

3

is so --

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Finish your

sentence.

6

MR. OLDHAM:

Thank you.

7

And because that is so, where there has been

8

a deprivation of counsel in that circumstance that

9

prohibits the development of that meaningful record, we

10

will allow you to go back, assuming you can show

11

prejudice.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN A. WOLF

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. WOLF:

17

this abatement issue.

18

Justice Alito just said, is only available -- as

19

referred in our brief on page 6, is only available when

20

there is a denial of the constitutional right to an

21

attorney.

22

I want to be very clear about
The abatement issue, as

And those situations is when there's a delay

23

in appointing the direct appeal attorney after the

24

trial.

25

for new trial, that time limitation is -- is -- that

So, during the 30-day window to file the motion

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 50

1

clock is running, and, if there's no attorney appointed,

2

the constitutional violation is considered a critical

3

stage of the trial.

4

And since there's -- if there's no attorney

5

appointed during those 30 days, that is the only time,

6

as Justice Kennedy is correct in saying, that that is

7

the time that the abatement procedure is permitted.

8

That is the only time.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you are suggesting that

10

if -- if an attorney is appointed within a few days or

11

within a week, as happened here, that, in that case,

12

there would not be that opportunity, it would be the

13

30 days, that's it, stop?

14

MR. WOLF:

And when that new -- that's

15

correct.

16

there was no attorney appointed, that new attorney, he,

17

himself, also has only 30 days.

18

And, if a new attorney is appointed because

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what about -- what

about the 75-day --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Justice Kennedy.

I understood that, if the

22

30-day rule had been complied with, within the 75 days,

23

you can ask the appellate court to please remand because

24

there is some additional evidence to be --

25

MR. WOLF:

That's not correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 51

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. WOLF:

-- to be determined.

That is not a correct statement

3

of the law, and -- and I would refer the Court to our

4

briefs, to the -- to the time that the -- the

5

authorities that we cite and also the amicus brief from

6

the State Bar of Texas.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what are --

8

what are these investigators, experts, they're available

9

to the new appellate counsel, what -- what are they

10

supposed to be doing?

11

MR. WOLF:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To the direct appeal attorney?
Yes, the direct

13

appeal attorney.

14

there's no way they can do anything within these time

15

limits, and, yet, the State procedure provides for

16

investigators and experts.

17

odd for them to provide for people and to pay for people

18

who can't do anything.

19

You say -- basically, you're saying

MR. WOLF:

It seems to me it would be

Well, they don't -- to do a

20

Wiggins claim -- to do -- they're doing things that

21

would -- investigates things that came out of the

22

record because that's what is relegated to the direct

23

appeal.

24

and has more time available to do the things, and it

25

becomes a function of time as well.

The habeas attorney has more money available

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 52

1

But I want to direct the Court's attention

2

also to the -- to the statement in Sprouse.

3

the statement --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MR. WOLF:

6
7

And -- and

The statement?

In the case of Sprouse, in our --

where am I?
It's page 20 -- 20 of our reply brief, that

8

the position in Sprouse is that there would be no

9

constitutional defect if appellate counsel didn't have

10

time or the record to raise the ineffective assistance

11

claim, and that's because the habeas proceeding is

12

available to direct -- to develop the claim and is the

13

proper place to do so.

14

It's on page 20 of our reply brief.

15

And that's the State's brief.

The other thing that I wanted to -- to bring

16

to the Court's attention is that the Respondent cites a

17

couple of cases that are aberrant -- they're

18

aberrations, and they really don't -- shouldn't -- since

19

this Court has -- has brought out a sensible rule in

20

Martinez and this Court has said this Court's rule

21

sensibly speak to the ordinary case, not -- not the

22

aberrational.

23

And that's exactly what we have here.

The last thing that I wanted to say is -- is

24

that the direct appeal, if -- if -- there's a choice

25

here that the State has systemically developed a system

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 53

1

that has caused -- that has directed attorneys on appeal

2

that the habeas attorney does the extra-record claims,

3

the Wiggins-type claims, and that the -- the claims that

4

are raised on the record go to the direct appeal

5

attorney.

6

That is the system that the State has

7

developed.

8

that have been promulgated by the court of criminal

9

appeals and the Supreme Court, and that's the system --

10

Those are the rules that govern this system

the scheme that we are under.

11

And because --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the position

13

of the State that says Martinez is relatively new, if

14

there is an extension of Martinez to cover this case,

15

then at least give the Texas courts the first crack at

16

deciding whether there was ineffective assistance of

17

counsel, instead of having that done in the Federal

18

court?

19

MR. WOLF:

We're just looking for the --

20

because of the procedural default scenario that we find

21

ourselves in, we tried to do that.

22

And -- and because 11.071 also has -- when

23

they -- when that was promulgated in 1995 in order to

24

expedite these claims, it provided three things:

25

new attorney; two, the money to fund those claims; and,

Alderson Reporting Company

One, a

Official
Page 54

1

three, an abuse of the writ, which is Section 5a, which

2

is what we met in -- in our case.

3

The Texas scheme, because of that abuse of

4

the writ, proceeds -- causes procedural default, and

5

that puts us in this quandary, where a person like

6

Mr. Trevino is unable to get relief because he has an

7

ineffective trial lawyer.

8

ineffective trial lawyer -- his ineffectiveness is being

9

insulated by the ineffectiveness of his -- of his habeas

10

And, now, he is -- that

lawyer.

11

And that's not what should happen.

It's --

12

it's just not equitable, it's not fair.

And

13

Mr. Trevino, someone in his situation, should have a

14

right to complain about the ineffectiveness of his trial

15

lawyer.
