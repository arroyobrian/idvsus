ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under this Court's exhaustion cases,

12

exhaustion has always been triggered when two criteria

13

have been satisfied and the district court properly

14

dismissed these claims because it found that they were

15

satisfied here on the undisputed facts.

16

that there must be an authorized sale under the patent

17

that was allegedly infringed.

18

dispute in this case.

19

that Intel was authorized to sell these components under

20

the system and method patents at issue in the case that

21

have been allegedly infringed.

22

The first is

That's never been in

The Federal Circuit recognized

And the second criteria is that the article

23

sold must be one that falls within the protection of the

24

patent that was allegedly infringed, here the system and

25

method patents.

But as Univis holds, that test doesn't
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

apply simply to articles that would directly infringe

2

the patent, because the law with contributory

3

infringement standards provides that protection to the

4

patent owner also to articles that would contributorily

5

infringe.

6

In other words JUSTICE STEVENS:

Ms. Mahoney, can I just

7

get one thing straight in my mind.

8

triggered the exhaustion doctrine in your judgment, the

9

general license to Intel or the sale by Intel to Quanta.

10

MS. MAHONEY:

Which transaction

I think they work in

11

combination here, Your Honor, because once the sale

12

was -- once the license was entered into with Intel and

13

once unrestricted rights were given to make, use and

14

sell components that would infringe, otherwise infringe

15

these patents, there was really nothing else that could

16

happen -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

unrestricted?

19

question.

20

That's one of the reasons I asked the

Wasn't there a use restriction on the resale?
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, there was -- what there

21

was, the sale was authorized.

22

What -

23

Was the license

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The sale was authorized.

On the condition that it

24

be sold to someone who would not use it on non-Intel

25

products.

MS. MAHONEY:

I don't think that's what the

2

lower courts found and I don't think that's what the

3

argument has ever been, Your Honor.

4

just like Bobbs-Merrill.

5

recognized that there is a difference between actually

6

conditioning the seller's authority to sell to someone

7

who's going to use it for some prohibited purpose, and

8

that would be a case like General Talking Pictures,

9

where it says, you do not have authority to sell to

I think this is

There is a -- this Court has

10

someone who's going to use it for the home market.

But

11

Bobbs-Merrill says if what you do instead -- it was a

12

copyright case that was applied in Motion Picture

13

Patents.

14

authority to sell, you don't say you'll be in breach if

15

you sell it to somebody who's going to sell books at

16

below the retail price I've specified, if instead what

17

you do is say, you have to agree you'll give them notice

18

that the -- that the owner of the invention, or in that

19

case the copyright, is not agreeing to your use of these

20

books or sale of these books at below a certain price,

21

that doesn't count.

22

that when -- that you can't -- that the patent owner

23

can't try to retain part of the monopoly right to sell.

If what you do instead is you give them

There's still an authorized sale,

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

then this case really isn't a big deal at all.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, if that's true
It just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

depends on exactly how you word the contract when the

2

patentee sells it to a purchaser.

3

other words, you can word it in such a way that the

4

patentee's rights extend further downstream and you're

5

saying all this case turns on is whether the wording

6

here was correct or not.

7

MS. MAHONEY:

You can word it -- in

Well, the wording hasn't been

8

in dispute, but a lot of important things turn on it,

9

because of course if Intel didn't have the authority to

10

make these sales, it would be liable for contributory

11

infringement.

12

much to pay for this license it cared deeply about

13

whether it was going to be exposed to that liability.

14

And undoubtedly when Intel decided how

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I understand

15

your position to -- to acknowledge that they could have

16

structured the sale to Intel in such a way as to achieve

17

the same result that you're saying is so bad under the

18

patent laws.

19

MS. MAHONEY:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

20

Once they have an authorized sale, then the results are

21

different, because if there has been an authorized sale

22

--

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I give you a specific

24

example?

I think the Chief has something on this order

25

in mind.

Could the patentee say to the licensee, to the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Intel, that, I license you to sell only to buyers who

2

have a license from the patentee?

3

licensee be limited in that way?

4

MS. MAHONEY:

Could -- could the

They could do that, and let me

5

explain the consequences of doing that.

If Intel then

6

under those circumstances sold to a buyer who did not

7

have a license, Intel would be liable for contributory

8

infringement because it wouldn't be an authorized sale,

9

and the buyer would be liable for infringement because

10

it didn't acquire the goods through an authorized sale.

11

If the buyer instead has the license, has obtained the

12

license from the patentowner, then there has been an

13

authorized sale and any remedies that the owner of the

14

patent would have against the buyer would be those found

15

in contract, because the triggering line under this

16

Court's cases is has there been an authorized sale?

17

this makes perfect sense because -

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

But explain to me -

19

perhaps I should ask Mr. Phillips this question -- but

20

why isn't it done that way?

21

wants to maintain control further down the line, why

22

doesn't the patentee just limit the licensee to selling

23

to people who are licensed?

24
25

MS. MAHONEY:

The way -- if the patentee

Presumably because in this

circumstance -- it's not in the record -- but presumably
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Intel wouldn't agree to these terms unless it in fact

2

was given authority to sell, no matter how it was going

3

to be used, because otherwise it would still be on the

4

hook for liability.

5

have done something that would have required an

6

agreement with -- you know, between -- only sell to

7

someone with an agreement.

8

parties didn't negotiate that term.

9

wasn't willing to do it that way.

10

And -- and presumably they could

But for whatever reason the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Perhaps Intel

So the parties are

11

unwilling to spell out exactly how this is going to work

12

out in their contract, and each side, it prefers to take

13

their chances on how the Federal Circuit's going to

14

rule.

15

encumbered by these additional license requirements and

16

the manufacturer presumably gets a lot more, but there's

17

a lot of uncertainty, uncertainty that could have been

18

cured by how the contract was drafted, and people prefer

19

to live with that uncertainty and litigate rather than

20

clear it up in the contract.

21

It's easier to sell these things if they're not

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, I think that this

22

Court's ruling would certainly make things clear, but I

23

think that the language of the contract recognizes that

24

the -- specifically says that, notwithstanding anything

25

to the contrary, the ordinary operation of patent
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exhaustion is supposed to apply here.

2

think Intel knew -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, I

Fine, and the person

4

who wrote that provision knows that the question of how

5

the patent-exhaustion doctrine applies is the subject of

6

great confusion, so much confusion that the Supreme

7

Court's going to have to decide it, and yet they put

8

that in there rather than spelling out in the contract

9

exactly which they had in mind, whether or not you could

10

impose these further restrictions or couldn't.

11

MS. MAHONEY:

But, Your Honor, I think that

12

under this Court's decision in Univis Lens, as the

13

district court recognized, the answer in this case is

14

actually quite clear what the patent-exhaustion doctrine

15

would require.

16
17

And the reason it's clear -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it wasn't

clear to the Federal Circuit, I guess.

18

MS. MAHONEY:

It wasn't clear to the Federal

19

Circuit, but it was clear to the district court, showing

20

that the idea that somehow it was absolutely known to

21

everybody what the outcome of this issue would be is not

22

correct.

23

understood that Univis Lens was the controlling case.

24

Of course, the Federal Circuit didn't even cite it.

25

the district court found that the Univis Lens standard

The district court, I think correctly,

9

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

was satisfied because these components were necessarily

2

manufactured in a manner that satisfied, that included

3

the functionality of the system and method patents at

4

issue here.

5

own claim charts and says that their own allegations

6

show that they were manufactured in a way that met many

7

of the limitations of the claims.

8
9

At 30a, the district court looks to LGE's

In addition, at 67 of the petition appendix,
she says that by attaching the components, the Intel

10

chips, to the -- the other generic wires and memory, it

11

necessarily caused these products to infringe.

12

46, she says, "Failure to follow Intel's design

13

specifications would render the computers inoperable."

And, at

So, this is a case where there's just no

question that if LGE's allegations are correct these

16

products would have contributorily infringed.

17

knew that in order to avoid potential liability to -- to

18

LGE, that it had to get full authority to sell, and it

19

did.

20

Instead, there's simply the Federal Circuit's view that

21

even if you have an authorized sale, that the

22

patentowner is nevertheless allowed to say, okay, I

23

authorize the seller to sell it to anybody, but I want

24

to retain the right to control the use of the --

25

buyer.

So Intel

And there's never been any dispute about that.

of the

And that's exactly what this Court's cases have
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

always said, with the exception of A.B. Dick, cannot be

2

done because the whole point of the exhaustion doctrine

3

is to demarcate the line between where the monopoly

4

power to control rights to use and sell end and where

5

any rights under contract must begin.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, there's one -

7

there's one more wrinkle that you don't expressly advert

8

to and that is the argument that what is in issue here

9

are the -- are the systems and methods patents, rather

10

than the -- the equipment component patents.

11

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that with respect to

13

the equipment component patents nothing is being

14

retained, but with respect to the systems and method

15

patents nothing was being granted.

16

to that answer to your argument?

17

MS. MAHONEY:

What is your answer

It's completely inconsistent

18

with the way the case has been litigated from the outset

19

as well as the terms of the contract.

20

petition appendix, the Federal Circuit acknowledges that

21

Intel had full authority to sell these components under

22

all of the patents, including the system and method

23

patents.

24

sell under the system and method patents, it would be

25

potentially liable for contributory infringement.

At page 5 of the

If it didn't have authority to manufacture and

11

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in fact LGE has acknowledged in its brief in footnote 7

2

that Intel isn't potentially liable for contributory

3

infringement under the terms of this agreement.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So the answer simply is

5

that that the argument rests upon a mistake of fact

6

which has not been challenged in the record?

7

MS. MAHONEY:

It absolutely has not.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes.

The component patents are not

10

at issue here at all.

11

have one patent on a component and another patent on a

12

system where the component would contributorily infringe

13

is nonsensical.

14

patents on them.

15

by authorizing the sale of the component all of the

16

owner's rights are released in that.

17

had been a sale of a component where a patent owner

18

says, I'll authorize you to sell my -- my -- that

19

component under my component patent, but if you sell it

20

under my system patent -- I'm not giving you authority

21

to sell it under my system patent, so if you sell it,

22

I'm going to sue you for infringement, that didn't

23

happen here, and it's never been litigated in that way.

If, instead, there

Instead, that first criteria of the
authorized sale has plainly been satisfied, and the only
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question in this case has been whether or not this

2

satisfied the contributory infringement standard that

3

Univis Lens uses to define what articles -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Ms. Mahoney, I understand

5

that's really the way it's been litigated, but I have to

6

confess I was puzzled by the court of appeals' statement

7

that the granting of the license constituted a sale for

8

exhaustion purposes, and they cited the Masonite case

9

for that proposition, but it doesn't seem to me to

10
11

support that proposition.
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, I think all that

12

that really is saying is that at a point when you enter

13

into -- a patentowner enters into an unrestricted

14

license to make, use, and sell with a manufacturer, then

15

at that point any articles that are manufactured under

16

that license, effectively the patent's been exhausted.

17

But I think it's easier to -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19
20
21
22

It's not exhausted by the

manufacturer, is it?
MS. MAHONEY:

No.

For contributorily

infringing JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's exhausted under this

23

view by the licensee's sale of an article that it

24

manufactured pursuant to the license.

25

MS. MAHONEY:

But -- right, manufactured
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pursuant -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And it seems to think

3

there's no distinction between the sale itself and the

4

basic underlying license, whereas I had thought for

5

years that there was recognized a distinction between

6

those two transactions.

7

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, I think that it just

8

means that once you have that transaction any sales that

9

occur for those articles under that license are going to

10

be exhausted by definition.

11

certainly focused on the sale of the articles to Quanta

12

from Intel, and I think, you know, it makes sense to

13

look at it that way.

14

But, you know, we have

And, as indicated, there really is -- there

15

have been arguments that somehow this deprives the

16

patentowner of the right to collect its full royalty,

17

but that doesn't make any sense.

18

you look at the rights that are afforded under

19

contributory infringement, what Congress has done in

20

Section 271(c) and what this Court had done before was

21

to say that if you are the owner of a system patent or a

22

method patent, you can go ahead and collect your royalty

23

when someone sells a product that will contributorily

24

infringe.

25

Because if you -- if

In other words, your -- your product is
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sufficiently -- your patent is sufficiently embodied in

2

those contributorily infringing products that it's

3

appropriate for you to collect your royalty there.

4

That's exactly what happened in this case.

5

its royalty from Intel, did give them authority to sell

6

products which would otherwise contributorily infringe,

7

and now what it's seeking to do is to say, despite the

8

authorized sale, despite the fact it would

9

contributorily infringe, we want to collect another

LGE did get

10

royalty from the buyer of the product that can't use it

11

for any other purpose.

12

we had them sent a notice that said we wanted to do

13

that.

14

Why?

Well, because we have -

Under this Court's cases, that is completely

15

impermissible.

In two cases in particular, Motion

16

Picture Patents, they tried to do the exact same thing.

17

And in the Millinger case the patentowner said that it

18

had never gotten paid for the extension rights under its

19

patent.

20

the article, that's the royalty you get.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this Court said:

I have just one question.

Nope; once you've sold

I see your white light is

22

on.

Are there cases where

23

some downstream restrictions on use might be necessary

24

to prevent the patent from becoming worthless, i.e., in

25

the biological area for replication of seeds in
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agriculture and so forth?

2

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, what we're -- exhaustion

3

is triggered when -- with respect to the rights to

4

control and use.

5

differently.

6

Rights to make are treated

Univis, of course, though, holds that when

7

you're talking about the sale of a contributorily

8

infringing product, you're really talking about the

9

right to -- to make it, to use it, to complete the -

10

complete the article.

11

But I think -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

of your principal cases.

13

MS. MAHONEY:

I thought Univis was one

It is, absolutely.

It holds

14

-- in other words, what Univis holds is that when you

15

have an article that is uncompleted -- it's not finished

16

-- as in this case, by the -- the sale will -- will

17

mean, by definition, that you can use it to complete the

article.

AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

5

For 150 years this Court has held that an

6

authorized sale removes the particular item sold from

7

the protection of the patent laws.

8

erroneously transformed that patent-exhaustion doctrine

9

from a definitional principle that delimits the scope of

The court below

10

the patent grant into an optional default assumption

11

that can be discarded at the whim of the patentee.

12

If the rationale of the court of appeals were correct,

13

this Court's decisions in cases like Univis, Motion

14

Picture Patents, Straus, Bauer and Boston Store would

15

have to have gone the other way, because in each of

16

those cases this Court held that the exhaustion

17

principle overrode express restrictions that the

18

patentee had attempted to impose on after-sale use or

19

resale by an authorized purchaser.

20

This Court should follow its precedents and

21

reaffirm the principle that the patent-exhaustion

22

doctrine precludes a patentee from employing the patent

23

law to enforce post-sale restrictions on use or resale

24

by authorized purchasers, that is -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Hungar, is there a

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason why Congress codified this doctrine in the

2

Copyright Act, but not in the Patent Act?

3

MR. HUNGAR:

We -- there's nothing in the

4

legislative record that would explain that, Your Honor.

5

Presumably it's because Congress wanted to specify

6

particular limits, which Section 109 of the Copyright

7

Act does.

8

define the scope of the doctrine in the copyright

9

context in a way that it has not sought -- found it

10

It wanted to specify particular limits to

necessary to do in the patent area.

11

But there's no legislative history about

12

this.

13

codified, recodified, and readopted, reaffirmed, the

14

principles of the Court's cases on infringement

15

generally.

16
17
18

I mean, this Court has said that the 1952 act

Obviously JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the PTO didn't take

any position on whether it should be codified?
MR. HUNGAR:

I'm not aware of anything in

19

the legislative history of the 1952 codification on the

20

subject of the patent exhaustion doctrine one way or the

21

other; but, obviously, Congress did not express any

22

dissatisfaction with it.

23

It did change certain aspects of patent law,

24

but it did not attempt in any way to override or change

25

the effect of the first-sale doctrine, which under this
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court's cases has been perfectly clear for well over a

2

century and has the effect we've suggested.

3

And we submit that, although the Respondent

4

essentially ignores or runs away from the rationale of

5

the court of appeals, we submit it's important for this

6

Court to explicitly address and explicitly reject the

7

Federal Circuit's misunderstanding of the

8

patent-exhaustion doctrine, its view that a patentee can

9

essentially override it simply by attaching a notice to

10

the article that has been sold in an authorized sale.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Although you think

12

it can be overridden simply by providing in the contract

13

Ms. Mahoney said, if the -- if LG here had given a

Yes, because it was an

unauthorized sale.

like your friend on the other side, the Respondent, had

that also limit in significant ways what you can and

2

cannot write into a contract.

3

MR. HUNGAR:

That's exactly right.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think that's

5

an important question.

6

page 16 of your brief to say that the patent-exhaustion

7

doctrine doesn't apply in that situation and that you,

8

therefore, can't have the rights and remedies under

9

patent law.

10

I understood the argument at

You told me earlier that if the person to

11

whom Intel sells the product uses it contrary to the

12

license stipulation, they would be liable for patent

13

infringement.

14

Your answer to Justice Breyer suggests to me

15

that you're saying only that they're liable to -- for

16

contract infringement, and that's a very big difference.

17

MR. HUNGAR:

Well -- but, Your Honor, it all

18

goes back to the question:

19

of the article at issue?

20

what the licensee -

21
22
23

Was there an authorized sale
If the sale is authorized, if

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sale from whom to

whom?
MR. HUNGAR:

The sale from the licensee to

24

the purchaser.

The license is not a sale -- is not a

25

sale for purposes of the patent exhaustion.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the Federal Circuit was just wrong in saying that,

2

because what the patent-exhaustion doctrine talks about

3

is the sale of an article.

4

of the particular article removes that article from the

5

-- from the patent monopoly.

6

All the cases say the sale

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But what you -

7

well, but what you say in your brief is that in the

8

situation we're talking about the licensee stands in the

9

shoes of the patentee.

Now, if that's right it seems to

10

me that you're telling me that the patent remedies are

11

available and not simply contractual remedies.

12

MR. HUNGAR:

No.

What we're saying is this.

13

If -- if the licensee has a restricted license, that is

14

its right to sell is restricted, it can only sell on

15

Mondays and not on Tuesdays -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MR. HUNGAR:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -

-- and it sells on a Tuesday.
Well, or, more

19

pertinently, it can only sell if the person they sell to

20

agrees not to use the product in a certain way.

21

MR. HUNGAR:

Fine.

If they have that

22

restriction and they sell and they do not -- they do not

23

obtain the contractual promise of the party that they

24

are obligated to obtain, they're violating the terms of

25

their right to sell.

It's patent infringement by the
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

seller, and if the buyer uses it it's patent

2

infringement by them as well.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Exactly.

That's the

4

critical point.

5

other words, the kind of third person in this chain,

6

uses the patented article in a way that is contrary to

7

the license that was given to the second person in the

8

chain, then he is liable for contributory infringement

9

under the patent laws and not, as I understood you to

10

You're telling me that if the buyer, in

answer to Justice Breyer, only under contract law.

11

MR. HUNGAR:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13
14

Yes, because Do you sue under

patent law or just contract law?
MR. HUNGAR:

If -- in your hypothetical, as

15

I understand it, it's an unauthorized sale.

licensee does not have the right to sell under the

17

patent in those circumstances, and therefore the

18

exhaustion principle does not apply.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

But not every infringement

of the license is necessarily an unauthorized sale.

21

MR. HUNGAR:

That's correct.

22

restriction in the license which is not a restriction on

people can do downstream, they say to the licensee, you

can only sell if you obtain a contractual promise from

the purchaser.

Likewise, what happens in the real world is

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you saying that this

case would come out differently if instead of just

10

requiring a notice that the -- the item should only be

11

used on Intel products, that had been a condition of the

12

license.

13

and sell to only people who agree to use the product

14

exclusively with Intel products?

15

If the license itself said you may manufacture

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes.

In if those

16

circumstances, if Quanta had -- if that -- if that

17

license condition -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So the key fact in this

19

case is it was just a requirement of giving notice

20

rather than a condition in the license?

21

MR. HUNGAR:

But let me be clear.

The key

22

distinction is between an authorized sale and an

unauthorized sale.

24

that is, Intel -

Your Honor -- to promise to limit the use and the

would be a breach of contract but it would not be patent

that we are talking about?

you would ordinarily -- you don't deal with this as an

something that only has a single use and that's in a

8

go and use it that way.

in this case is that both the district court and the

does clause 3.8 of the license mean?

Alderson Reporting Company

What in the world
It says,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

2

agreement, the parties agree that nothing herein shall

3

in any way limit or alter the effect of patent

4

exhaustion that would otherwise apply when a party

5

hereto sells any of its licensed products."

6

In other words, the patent exhaustion

7

doctrine may not apply for all the reasons that we've

8

been talking about, but it applies in the way it would

9

apply if we just sold these licensed products.

That

10

seems to me to give away everything you're talking

11

about.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

Because that -- that

13

depends on the scope of the patent exhaustion doctrine.

14

If the patent exhaustion doctrine is limited to the sale

15

of the specific product -- let's for instance assume for

16

a moment that what in fact happened was that Intel sold

17

the system, rather than the chips.

18

that would exhaust the patent doctrine.

19

Then that would -

Now, you know, the question is -- and here

20

there is a disconnect in some respects between the

21

Mallinckrodt decision in the Federal Circuit and some of

22

this Court's previous decisions on to the extent to

23

which you can condition a sale, and I think in some ways

24

that language may have been given up what rights we

25

might have been able to assert under Mallinckrodt on a
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

somewhat broader basis.

But I don't think it can be

2

read any further than that, and it certainly -- and the

3

key to this is it certainly doesn't in any way waive our

4

rights, you know, as an implied license matter, because

5

that's -- specifically what both the district court and

6

the court of appeals held is there is no implied license

7

in this particular context, and so therefore for them to

8

prevail they have to expand the patent exhaustion

9

doctrine or the first sale doctrine beyond the first

10

sale; and that I submit to you is something that's

11

simply not appropriate.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Am I correct in

13

understanding that you do not defend the Mallinckrodt

decision?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Mallinckrodt decision, Justice Stevens, and clearly I

don't believe I have to.

Univis was the fact that it was all one patent and that

20

all you were doing was fulfilling the rights that had

21

been provided for you in that single patent, and that

22

that that's fundamentally -- and that the Court

23

recognized that if there were a separate patent involved

24

and you were trying to enforce those rights, that would

be a completely different matter.

the same point Justice Breyer made, which is, look, if

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Justice Breyer, we can

It seems to be kind of an

unusual answer to the implied license argument, because

normally it doesn't depend on what the patentee decides

to say somewhere down - down the line.

an unusual reason for not finding an implied license, I

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They're saying the reason

they have done so is that the following distinction is

5

significant.

6

that says you can't sell this unless certain conditions

7

are satisfied and, on the other hand, a license that

8

says you can sell this, but if you sell it to a buyer

who is described by conditions A and B, you've got to

A and B.

13

there is no limit on the right to sell, but there's a

14

warning about what we're going to do if you do sell

15

under certain conditions.

16

that unless you have a contract of the former sort which

17

limits your right to sell, then when you do sell,

exhaustion applies and whatever you may do against the

you know, as to how far you can go down the road in

I thought this
Mallinckrodt

10

leaves that issue open, but that's not -- that's not the

11

question.

12

The issue here is if I sell to you, Justice

13

Souter, a particular chip, whether I condition it or

14

not, I think that's -- to me that's unenforceable.

15

the question is, can you then take that chip and use it

to violate a separate patent?

that it's not exhaustion -

No.

you're going.

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What it -- what it involves

6

is the statement that they make that if you license the

7

manufacture, use, and sale of a particular component and

8

that particular component has only one reasonable use -

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

Right.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- then you have

11

necessarily licensed them to sell with that ultimate use

12

in mind, and when you do -- when you license them to

13

sell, the patent-exhaustion doctrine attaches to any

14

patent right that you may have, whether you call it

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And you are saying that

21

argument is no good because that, in fact, is an implied

22

license argument, and there were findings that there was

23

no implied license.

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So I understand your

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

position.

2
3

MR. PHILLIPS:

That is correct, Justice

Souter.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.
And let me further Then explain -- now this

7

you might know because it's just following up on what

8

Justice Souter said better than I did.

9

these briefs I've gotten the impression that at least

I think from

10

some people think that where you invent a component,

11

say, like the bicycle pedals, and it really has only one

12

use, which is to go into a bicycle, it's the easiest

13

thing in the world to get a patent not just on that

14

component but to also get a patent on the system, which

15

is called handlebars, body, and pedals.

16

And since that's just a drafting question,

17

all that we would do by finding in your favor is to

18

destroy the exhaustion doctrine, because all that would

19

happen, if it hasn't happened already, is these

20

brilliant patent lawyers, and they don't even -- they

21

can be great patent lawyers, not just fine lawyers, and

22

just draft it the way I said and that's the end of the

23

exhaustion doctrine.

And that's why it is preferable to

24

say it is exhausted.

What is exhausted?

25

patent on this component and, two, the patent on any
47
Alderson Reporting Company

One, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

system involving this component where that system is the

2

only reasonable use of the component, rather than using

3

the terminology "implied license."

4

Now, I think that's an argument that's being

5

made in some of these briefs, and if so I'd like to you

6

reply.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think that clearly

8

understates the role of the PTO in granting a separate

9

patent.

I mean, this is not -- these are not things you

pick up at the corner drugstore.

them.

12

be presumed valid," each claim shall be presumed valid

13

independently of the validity of other claims.

14

there's an independence that's embedded in this entire

15

scheme.

16

patent rights on something that's fundamentally not

17

different from the other -- from some other patent, the

18

solution to that is a validity challenge.

19

I think that's exactly what all of those arguments are

20

--

And if you look at Section 282, "a patent shall

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That argument didn't

prevail last year in the KSR case, right?
48
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, we're

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- we've had experience with the Patent Office where it

2

tends to grant patents a lot more liberally than we

3

would enforce under the patent law.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but all -- I'm not -

5

I'm not particularly criticizing the PTO.

What I'm

6

saying is that the statutory scheme presumes that there

7

is a separateness when a patent is issued and, therefore

8

-- and which is why -- again, the first -- there's no

9

reason to go to an expansion of the first-sale doctrine

10

in order to deal with the kinds of problems you have

11

here because in general -- in general you can deal with

12

it as a matter of implied license, but that issue has

13

been resolved adverse to the other side in this case,

14

and there's no reason to sort of fill in that void.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Phillips, when you say

16

that was resolved adversely, you say there was a finding

17

of no implied license.

Alderson Reporting Company

Yes, if Intel

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that implied license just as it applied to the -- to the

2

license of the chips.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the answer to that is

4

it shouldn't, that the exhaustion doctrine should be

5

retained as a first-sale doctrine alone.

6

it's always been understood for 150 years.

7

expand it this way is to undermine the rights of -- in

8

the separate patents.

9

That's the way
And to

And now I'll try to make the point I wanted

10

to make to Justice Souter.

you're trying to do is expand what you get under a

23

condition to what you get under a notice.

reason that troubles me is because if you had imposed a

condition on the sale, Intel wouldn't have paid you as

no serious basis for doubting what Intel knew precisely

what it was getting in this.

both sides of the aisle in terms of litigation, and it

knew that there were separate patents here and that when

with that solution as well.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MS. MAHONEY:

I'd like to start by

10

emphasizing what counsel did not say.

He never said

11

that Intel lacked the authority under the system and

12

method patents to sell these components.

13

that.

14

were they released?

15

infringement, otherwise.

He never said

In fact, he said that Intel was released.

16

Why

This would have been contributory

The reason they were released was because

17

they had the authority under this license to sell these

18

components under the system patent.

19

Federal Circuit acknowledged, and that's what the

20

district court recognized, and it's never been in

21

dispute.

22

And that's what the

Their position is simply that, despite that,

23

despite express authority to sell these under that

24

patent -- not just under some other patent, under the

25

patents at issue here -- that they can enforce
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

conditions on post-sale use.

2

has never allowed.

And that's what this Court

3

Univis is on all fours.

They say, well,

4

that just involved a single patent.

Well, as far as

5

this case is concerned, it just involves a single

6

patent, too.

7

Quanta's taking of the components and combining them

8

with some generic things like wires and memory

9

necessarily infringed under LGE's allegations.

10

The whole issue here is whether or not

And the district court found that they

11

would, and that's not in dispute.

12

is that, just as in Univis where you had -- the court

13

finds there were really two products there.

14

there were two different commodities, the lens blank and

15

the finished lens.

16

And what that means

It finds

It says under Miller, the Miller/Tydings

17

Act, these are two different commodities, and the patent

18

was only on the finished lens.

19

that finished lens, you had to -- you had to make a lens

20

blank that would embody many of the limitations of the

21

claim.

22

happened here.

23

But, in order to make

That's exactly what the district court found

For this, when Intel manufactured these

24

chips, the microprocessors and the chipsets, it

25

manufactured them in a way that embodied many of the
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

limitations of the system and method patents that are at

2

issue here.

3

they said, well, we are dealing with a product that is

4

being manufactured in multiple stages.

5

So, as in the language of Univis, there

And during that first stage, while it's true

6

it wasn't -- it didn't directly infringe because the

7

lens blank wasn't the patented product, they,

8

nevertheless, practiced the patent in part.

9

Because they -- they -- some of the -- while

Why?

10

manufacturing it, they have met some of the limitations

11

of the claim.

12

And they said when that lens blank was sold,

13

that it exhausted the rights of the patent owner to

14

enforce any conditions, any type of conditions on use or

15

resale after that sale.

16

implied license because of the exhaustion doctrine.

17

Once there is an authorized sale of a product that is

18

protected by the patent that covered that final finished

19

product, exhaustion is triggered.

And it didn't have to rely on

20

That's exactly what we have here.

And they

21

said, oh, but you could disclaim that with an agreement.

22

Well, in Univis there was an agreement.

23

purchaser of that lens blank specifically agreed by

24

contract that it would only use it in certain ways and

25

only charge certain prices.

So they expressly

57
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disclaimed, you know, the idea that they were -- that

2

they couldn't use it in those ways.

3

this Court found exhaustion.

4

And, nevertheless,

When the district court found no "implied

5

license," all the court was saying was, well, under the

6

Federal Circuit precedent "implied license" is an

7

"equitable doctrine."

8

I see my time is finished.
