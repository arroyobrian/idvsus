CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Hawkins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HAWKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Based on the plain terms of section 1981,

11

this Court's interpretation of that statute under

12

Runyon, Patterson, and Domino's Pizza, as well as

13

Congress' recognition of the distinction between

14

discrimination and retaliation and this Court's decision

15

in Burlington Northern, section 1981 does not contain a

16

separate cause of action for retaliation.

17

The Court starts with a review of the text

18

of the statute.

Section 1981(a) says that all persons

19

shall have the right, the same right as is enjoyed by

20

white citizens to make and enforce contracts.

21

like "the same," "equal," and "like" are all in 1981(a),

22

and those words all have normal, plain, ordinary

23

meaning, that is identical.

24

is in the making and enforcing of contracts all persons

25

shall have identical rights as white citizens.

Words

So what section 1981 says

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you see any meaningful

3

difference between the language of 1981 and 1982 in this

4

regard?

5

MR. HAWKINS:

Justice Alito, I do, and in

6

that context section 1981 was amended in 1991, and with

7

a lot of this Court's precedent in terms of how statutes

8

are viewed, they all have a life.

9

a new life when it was amended in 1981.

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

This section 1981 has

Do you think that it was

narrowed in 1981?

12

MR. HAWKINS:

I think with respect to this

13

issue, Your Honor, of retaliation, that it was.

14

say it because of this.

15

1991 Civil Rights Act and in that act they also included

16

retaliation for 2 U.S.C. 1212.

17

consciously thinking about this issue of retaliation.

18

They had Patterson that had come before it, they had

19

West Virginia Hospital that had come before it, saying

20

you have to have specific terms, you have to deal with

21

specific issues.

22

And I

In 1991, Congress passed the

JUSTICE ALITO:

So Congress was

Well, wasn't the purpose of

23

the 1991 act to broaden the scope of 1981 rather than

24

narrow it?

25

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, with respect to

the '91 act, it was supposed to specifically pick up the

2

post-formation contract issues under Patterson.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

designed to overrule Patterson.

5

MR. HAWKINS:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

Well, Your Honor Not overrule.

They can't

overrule it, but change the law -

8

MR. HAWKINS:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Which is to say it was

Well, it didn't -- so that Patterson would

no longer be right.

11

MR. HAWKINS:

It didn't change Patterson.

12

believe as Chief Judge Easterbrook said, Patterson has

13

been cited some 27 times by this Court -

18

still good law.

post-formation contracts.

What it did was to clarify the issue of

Do you mean Patterson

21

would come out the same under 1981 as amended by the

22

1991 act.

23
24
25

I

MR. HAWKINS:

Yes.

I think Patterson would

come out the same, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think Congress would

5

have been quite amazed at that rule.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think that they would be

astounded.

4

MR. HAWKINS:

No.

In the context of the new

5

post-formation -- excuse me.

6

a little differently, Your Honor.

7

out differently if you were dealing with the precise

8

issue in Patterson.

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I understood your question
Yes, it would come

Are you saying that

before the 1991 amendment retaliation was included?

11

MR. HAWKINS:

No.

I would say, Justice

12

Ginsburg, that before the 1991 amendment retaliation

13

wasn't included and it wasn't included after the 1991

14

amendment.

15
16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What change did the 1991

amendment make then?

17

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, it wasn't included -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You say it was intended to

19

change the outcome of Patterson.

20

say not in the respect of whether retaliation is

21

included but in what respect then?

22

MR. HAWKINS:

In what respect?

You

In respect to the

23

post-formation.

Patterson was dealing with those

24

aspects of just the initial making and enforcing of a

25

contract, not once you've got the contract established
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and in this case employment, what happens, promotions,

2

demotions, actions of that nature, Justice Scalia.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand you.

4

Patterson said that post-formation actions were not

5

covered, right?

6

MR. HAWKINS:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9
10
11

Correct.
Retaliation is one, but

just one of many post-formation actions, right?
MR. HAWKINS:

Well Your Honor -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What other post-formation

actions were there that -

12

MR. HAWKINS:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

action that was in action in Patterson?

15

MR. HAWKINS:

What other post-formation What was the post-formation

Patterson was dealing with the

16

issue about after you had the relationship could an

17

employer take an adverse discriminatory action against

18

the individual, and the Court said no.

19

with a harassment situation.

20

have a cause of action in the post-formation situation.

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It was dealing

Afterwards you could not

And Congress changed that

and the case we have is also post-formation.
MR. HAWKINS:

Well, but Congress changed it

24

to say that it would include, in subsection 1981(b),

25

that it would include certain specified post-formation
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

conduct with respect to JUSTICE SCALIA:

It didn't specify them.

I

3

think your point is probably that it includes the same

4

post-formation conduct that is prohibited at formation,

5

which is to say discrimination on the basis of race,

6

which is not retaliation; right?

7

MR. HAWKINS:

It did not change that, that's

8

correct, Your Honor.

It did not add retaliation.

9

And so what has taken place with respect to this issue

10

of discrimination and retaliation and the reason that we

11

say that it does not exist in section 1981 is Congress

12

in some 30 statutes we've been able to run across has

13

specifically included retaliation in provisions where

14

they so applauded appropriate -

15
16
17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under your view, would

harassment be prohibited by 1981 as amended?
MR. HAWKINS:

If it is racial harassment,

18

meaning the treating of someone differently than a white

19

citizen because of their race, then it would be.

20

the status issue and that's what was addressed in

21

Burlington Northern in terms of the distinction that

22

exists between discrimination and retaliation, one being

23

based on the individual status, which is really what

24

section 1981 is focused on.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's

But the term "harassment"

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is not included in 1981(b).

2

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, if it's just harassment,

3

Justice Kennedy, in the abstract -- I'm harassing

4

somebody because I don't like them -- whether they're

5

black or white, that wouldn't be actionable under

6

section 1981.

7

this action against the individual because of the color

8

of their skin, because of their race."

9

You have to have a focus of "I'm taking

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why isn't that true here?

10

Because we're not talking about retaliation in a vacuum;

11

we're talking about retaliation for complaining about

12

race discrimination.

13

MR. HAWKINS:

Your Honor, if you have a

14

situation where -- and I think it's even addressed in

15

some of the Respondent's brief.

16

going back in the '70s and '80s that were even cited by

17

the Seventh Circuit, all deal with situations even where

18

they were, if you want to call them retaliation, they

19

were retaliation based on directly the person's color of

20

their skin.

21

this employer is taking this or that action against

22

somebody because they're a black person.

23

taking -

24

And many of the cases

What kind of -- what kind

of right to be free from discrimination would there be

1

if once one complains one can be fired, demoted?

2

would not be a very effective right, would it be?

3

MR. HAWKINS:

That

Well, Your Honor, I mean there

4

are alternatives for that particular issue.

5

particular case, there was Title VII that fully

6

protected the Respondent from any form of discrimination

7

or retaliation.

8

there are state statutes.

9

In this

In addition, in the State of Illinois

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But one can say the same

10

thing for Title VII and, say, the Equal Pay Act.

11

are a lot of overlapping antidiscrimination laws.

12

doesn't mean that we shrink one because another exists.

13

MR. HAWKINS:

There
That

No, but there is precedent for

14

the fact that where one law does cover a particular

15

situation, we don't go about removing that impact.

16

Title VII clearly does cover this particular situation

17

of a retaliation, a pure retaliation claim.

18
19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why did they -- why did

they proceed under Title VII then?
MR. HAWKINS:

So

What -- what help -

Well, they did proceed under

21

Title VII, and that was dismissed by the Federal court

22

because he did not pay his proper filing fee on time in

23

compliance with Title VII requirements.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
often the case, isn't it?

Well, that's -- that's

I mean, the argument you just
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

made could go as well to somebody who uses 1981 to

2

complain about a racially-based demotion wasn't able to

3

use Title VII because he filed too late.

4

typical use of 1981; is it not?

5
6
7

MR. HAWKINS:

That's a

Well, it can be a use, yes,

Your Honor, that people do use it for that very purpose.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what is the difference

8

between this case -- you say, well, there's Title VII

9

and this would erode Title VII.

10
11

Doesn't it erode Title

VII when I'm complaining about, say, a demotion?
MR. HAWKINS:

No, because they can coexist

12

with respect to those particular issues, and this Court

13

has recognized that those two statutes can coexist.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does -- does the person who

15

is retaliated against, that is the person who complained

16

and is retaliated against, have to be the person who was

17

discriminated against?

18

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Your Honor, based on a

19

reading of Domino's, it would certainly appear that the

20

individual who is making the complaint to have

21

protection must be the individual who has the

22

contractual right, as opposed to complaining about a

23

third person.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, is your

position that in that situation a retaliation is not
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

covered by 1981?

2

MR. HAWKINS:

Yes, Your Honor.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

4

that you could argue that it's direct discrimination.

5

In other words, if you're fired, whatever form the

6

retaliation takes, that, as Justice Ginsburg suggests,

7

that that would be on the basis -- basis of race.

8

thought your position, or at least your position could

9

be narrowed to say it's only when the individual against

And I

10

whom the retaliation takes place is not the individual

11

complaining of the direct discrimination that your

12

position would be pertinent.

13

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Your Honor, we take the

14

position that in order to have a retaliation claim under

15

section 1981, it really has to be a discrimination

16

claim.

17

You have to be able to show that you CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's right.

18

That's why I thought the person directly discriminated

19

against would be able to phrase the retaliation claim

20

certainly as a discrimination claim.

21

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Your Honor, they can

22

make -- phrase it however they want to in terms of their

23

particular complaint, but the issue in terms of the

24

analysis under the plain text of section 1981 is whether

25

or not a white person in this situation is being treated
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

differently with respect to making a similar complaint.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Surely -- surely, you don't

3

mean what you just said a minute ago, that in order to

4

have a retaliation claim you must have a discrimination

5

claim.

6

MR. HAWKINS:

Well -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Surely it's your position

8

that even when you have a discrimination claim, you

9

don't have a retaliation claim.

I thought it was your

10

position there are no retaliation claims under this

11

statute.

12
13

MR. HAWKINS:

There is no retaliation claim

in the abstract under this statute, period, correct.

run-of-the-mill termination and harassment cases?

No, Your Honor.

Yes.

Why not?

There's a longer

There's no cap on damages.

MR. HAWKINS:

From our experience, more and

12

more people -- there's been a trend to go to State court

13

because more and more States -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

refine the hypothetical.

16

but in Federal court -

Well, then I have to

I don't want to take too much,

17

MR. HAWKINS:

In Federal -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- because it does seem to

19

me that Congress told us:

20

overlap between 1981 and Title VII, we don't care if

21

there's a longer statute of limitations, we don't care

22

if there's no cap an damages; we want 1981 to work.

23

that's -- 1981 does apply in a large number of

employment discrimination cases.

Your Honor, in answer to your

5

question, yes, we've seen more adding on section 1981

claims with Title VII claims in Federal court.

7

answer to that question is yes.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Of course, it's just for

race claims, and Title VII covers sex, national origin.

10
11

MR. HAWKINS:

Title VII covers race and

retaliation.

My point is that 1981

would not be available to other categories.

Yes, you do, but it's a longer

something on the street, and he says, I'm going to

upon the State and -

14

some kind of policy against that from the State law, he

15

couldn't do it?

16

MR. HAWKINS:

That's correct.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, here we have a

18

Federal statute that says that a black person shall have

19

the same right to make a contract as a white person.

20

But if nobody ever can report on that, that they're not,

21

it's not going to be the same right; it's going to be

22

zero right.

difference whether you're a thief in my example, whether

You could even be somebody from another country.

5

6

the State law tries to follow out that -- that policy of

7

not having bank robberies and of returning money to

8

rightful owners.

It doesn't matter who you are.
You

You could be anything.

But

9

Well, here we have a Federal policy, and the

10

Federal policy is that black people shall be treated the

11

same as white in respect to making a contract.

12

the law to allow you to fire anybody who complained

13

about it, then black people wouldn't have that right.

14

And therefore the policy is that you can't do it under

15

this statute because otherwise the written policy is

16

ineffective.

17
18
19

But were

I'm just remembering that from my written from my policy arguments that were in contract law.
MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Your Honor, I would go

20

back to the plain, clear terms with their ordinary

21

meaning, and it says equal rights as white citizens and

22

it talks about the same and that -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does it say anywhere, by

24

the way, in that statute that a black person who is

25

discriminated against can go to court and file a

Which is the statute that

3

does -- is there a statute that specifically gives you a

4

right to sue under 1981?

5

MR. HAWKINS:

Is there a statute?
Well, this Court has

6

established that, particularly with respect to section

7

1981, that an individual does have a right of action.

8
9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:
Yes, that's my point:

It has established it.

That the Federal court implied

from the statute a right of action.

11

Now, if they're implying a right of action

12

from the statute, why wouldn't courts also imply those

13

rights of action necessary to make the statute

14

effective?

15

MR. HAWKINS:

Because this Court in a

16

variety of cases such as Russello, West Virginia,

17

University Hospital, Arlington Public School, has said

18

that we look at the text and we examine the text of the

19

statute, and unless it is ambiguous -- and I would

20

certainly submit that words like "same," "like," "equal"

21

are not ambiguous terms -- that we leave it alone; that

22

that's -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

That isn't the word I was

24

looking for.

The word I was looking for in 1981(a) is

25

the word "and can bring a lawsuit in Federal court."
19
Alderson Reporting Company

I

don't see that written there.

2

MR. HAWKINS:

It's not in there, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, correct.

So we've

4

implied that.

And therefore, if I can imply that, why

5

can't we imply a lawsuit on behalf of those who need the

6

lawsuit to make the right effective?

7

MR. HAWKINS:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. HAWKINS:

Because That was my basic question.

Well, in response to it, I

10

would simply say that you have to look to the text as to

11

how you're trying to apply it, and what you're applying

12

it to, and this particular statute protects against

13

different treatment, not specifically with respect to

14

some other -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Hawkins, don't we have

16

a whole line of recent cases which say we have set our

17

face against implying causes of action?

18

MR. HAWKINS:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

Yes.
A whole bunch of recent

cases saying we're not going to do that any more.

21

MR. HAWKINS:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

said we're not going to do it any more.

24

MR. HAWKINS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We used to do it, but we

That's correct, Your Honor.
So why don't you invoke

20
Alderson Reporting Company

those?

2

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, I -- we -- we do invoke

3

those in our brief, and those are all part of what I'm

4

getting at in terms of -- I mean Arlington School Board

5

was one of those cases.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We do have those

7

recent cases, but we also have the Sullivan case

8

interpreting -- interpreting 1982, which arose under the

9

prior approach to these questions.

And my question for

10

you is:

11

do we follow, the earlier case interpreting 1982 under

12

the more freewheeling approach to statutory

13

interpretation or this later body of law that says we're

14

not going to do that any more?

15

Under principles of stare decisis, which body

MR. HAWKINS:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

16

particularly since this Court has Runyon, Patterson, and

17

Domino's interpreting Section 1981, that's what to look

18

at to interpret section 1981, not Sullivan, which

19

interprets a different statute.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They all But it's a statute that

21

has the same derivation.

They're both from the 1866

22

Civil Rights Act, and they're both set up the same way.

23

1982 also says "same" as 1981 does.

24

odd to take these twin measures and say one includes

25

retaliation and the other doesn't?
21
Alderson Reporting Company

So wouldn't it be

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Wouldn't Congress, when it revised 1981 in

2

1991 been aware of Sullivan and expect this Court to

3

interpret those twin statutes the same way?

4

MR. HAWKINS:

Justice Ginsburg, with all due

5

respect, I would think not; and the reason is this

6

Court, when it acted in 1991, had in front of it to look

7

at Patterson, which was saying, we're going to interpret

8

Section 1981 in a straightforward, plain-text situation.

9

In fact, Patterson says in it if the right is not

10

specifically set forth in section 1981, there is no

11

relief.

12

Then after that, you had West Virginia,

13

which was decided in March of 1991, again taking that

14

same sort of approach with respect to if it's not in the

15

statute, we're not going to make it.

16

it's a job left for Congress.

17

pass the law in November of '91.

18

That's the context.

It may be that

So they act on those and

And even in the Jackson

19

case, in looking back, Justice O'Connor ended up saying

20

that what we are looking back at is 1972 following 1969.

21

So in 1991 we're looking at Section 1981 being amended,

22

and we're looking at Patterson and West Virginia to give

23

the context.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wouldn't you look at what

Congress was trying to do in the 1991 amendments?
22
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is, Congress changed the law that this Court had

2

declared; and the message, the essential message, was

3

this Court has been too stingy in its interpretation of

4

Title -- of 1981, so we're going to change it.

5

MR. HAWKINS:

Correct.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it seems to me that

7

we wouldn't be hearing -- we wouldn't be grasping that

8

message.

MR. HAWKINS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't personally agree with it, But

JUSTICE SCALIA:

had no idea what our interpretation of 1981 was.

Is there anything in the statute which

MR. HAWKINS:

No.

There's nothing in that

at all.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is something to

7

that effect in the legislative history that explains why

8

Congress made the amendments it did in 1991.

9
10
11

MR. HAWKINS:

And we could have a whole

debate about the legislative history and what JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not?

Because the

12

legislative history does say, when they passed this,

13

that the new law will involve a claim, allow them to

14

make a claim of harassment, discharge, promotion,

15

transfer, retaliation, and hiring.

16

MR. HAWKINS:

Justice Breyer -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So when they write that in

18

the House report, isn't that some evidence that they did

19

look back and see Sullivan, and they did think that in

20

1982 there's a retaliation action, and therefore in 1981

21

there is one?

22

were people in Congress thinking that?

23

Isn't there at least evidence that there

MR. HAWKINS:

Yes, that's evidence that

24

somebody in Congress was thinking that.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. HAWKINS:

It doesn't have any

16

works against what ended up being in the statute.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I'm

Well, I think we're

18

familiar with that debate.

19

at the statute, if I ask you why isn't this an enjoyment

20

of a benefit, a privilege or term or a condition of the

21

contract, is your answer that this was an at-will

22

contract?

23

MR. HAWKINS:

But if we can look -- look

I think the Seventh Circuit is

saying we're not making the at-will argument in this

that there's different treatment than a white employee.

something happened to me negatively, therefore, I have a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Hawkins, is it at all

14

relevant on the issue that the several courts of appeals

have come out the same way both before the 1991

amendment and since the 1991 amendment, and opinions to

Section 1981 doesn't

15

making that complaint.

That's a good argument to

Congress.

Congress should enact a retaliatory

provision.

22

it says is that there has to be discrimination on the

24

retaliation for making a complaint is not firing him on

the basis of race.

But the statute says what it says, and what

couldn't fire a white whistleblower who says this

6

Wouldn't that white whistleblower have a cause of action

7

for being fired?

8
9

MS. HYNDMAN:

You would acknowledge that you

They would in fact have a

cause of action, Justice Scalia.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But this Court -

On your theory, but that

11

has nothing to do with the text of the statute, which

12

requires discrimination on the basis of race.

13

with you entirely that it would make sense to provide a

14

cause of action for retaliation, but we don't write

15

statutes.

16

statute that says that.

17

We read them.

MS. HYNDMAN:

I agree

And there's nothing in this

This Court held in the Jackson

18

case that discrimination on the basis -- that

19

retaliation when there was a complaint about sex

20

discrimination constituted discrimination on the basis

21

of sex.

22

someone makes a complaint about race discrimination and

23

they are retaliated against that they are being

discriminated against on the basis of race.

25

So it follows that here under section 1981 if

they put the caps in?

create a cause of action in order to make this

the words of the statute as amended help you.

think is quite wrong because that's not what section (c}

25

Your argument is that we should

I understand that argument.

I think the

And the

But that's almost an admission on the

MS. HYNDMAN:

The words in the statute that

provide the basis for this claim is that you are
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

entitled to the same rights to make and enforce

2

contracts as white citizens.

3

consistently interpreted that to mean -

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this Court has

But that was there

5

before -- but that was there as of the time of

6

Patterson.

7

MS. HYNDMAN:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9
10

That's correct.
So then Congress did

nothing by the amendment to help your case.
MS. HYNDMAN:

What the Court did to help our

11

case was that after Patterson was decided and before the

12

section -- before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was

13

passed, the lower courts had interpreted Patterson to

14

restrict retaliation claims because they generally

15

involve post formation conduct.

16

clear in the -- in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 is that

17

they wanted to have protection throughout the entire

18

contractual relationship.

19
20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Patterson was not a

retaliation case.

21

MS. HYNDMAN:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

And what Congress made

That's correct, Your Honor.
Patterson was a discharge

and harassment case.

24

MS. HYNDMAN:

That's correct.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the words do seem to

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cover that.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

But your point is

3

that Patterson made a number of lower courts think that

4

retaliation was no longer a viable cause of action.

5
6

MS. HYNDMAN:
Justice -

7
8

That's absolutely right,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Before Patterson they had

all thought retaliation was a cause of action.

9

MS. HYNDMAN:

They consistently thought

10

there was a cause of action for retaliation based upon

11

Sullivan.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But nothing that you

13

argued so far shows that the words of the statute as

14

amended, that is to say new subsection (b), help your

15

case.

16

MS. HYNDMAN:

The words of the statute that

17

help us establish the cause of action are that it

18

made -- that Congress made clear that the entire

19

contractual relationship would be covered from the

20

beginning of the contractual relationship through the

21

end, through termination.

22

original words of the statute that lower courts had

23

interpreted to allow a cause of action for retaliation

24

and with subsection (c), which uses broader language, it

25

says "impairment by discrimination" -- under this

And coupling that with the

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court's holding in Jackson -

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I do not read subsection

3

(c) as giving substantive rights.

I mean, you can argue

4

about that.

5

think you have a valid point when they say that they're

6

extending the protection for the life of the contract.

7

But I still want to know what particular words in

8

section (b) you rely on?

9

MS. HYNDMAN:

I think you have to talk about (b), and I

"Benefit"?

"Privilege"?

Any of those could apply,

10

Justice Kennedy.

11

legislating against was this Court's restriction in

12

Patterson and saying that the rights that are protected

13

are only those rights at the making of the contract and

14

the enforcement of the contract.

15

language to cover the entire contractual relationship.

16

So that, for example, here where you have a termination

17

caused by retaliation, then you would have a cause of

18

action for retaliation under the statute.

19

But the -- what Congress was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And they expanded the

I guess those court of

20

appeals cases pre-1991 that found there was a

21

retaliation claim, right, those cases were just wrong as

22

to whether there was any post-contract claim?

23

mean, they were wrong about that.

24

said you're wrong.

25

MS. HYNDMAN:

Right?

I

Patterson, in effect,

Patterson said you were wrong.
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So if they were wrong about

2

whether there's a post-contract claim, why wouldn't they

3

be wrong about whether there's a retaliation claim?

4

MS. HYNDMAN:

There were -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know why we should

6

give deference to them on the one point when they've

7

been proven wrong on the other one.

8

MS. HYNDMAN:

9

They based that on -- on this

Court's reading in Sullivan.

And Sullivan interpreted

10

the companion statute to section 1981, which was section

11

1982.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because it's ironic to say

13

all those cases were wrong when Congress agreed with

very hard in a place for a word that couldn't be there.

6

MS. HYNDMAN:

I would agree with that.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that was true in

8

Sullivan because a property owner who wants to sell is

9

in a particularly advantageous position to enforce the

10

rights of the buyer.

11

And to extend it to the situation we have here is quite

12

an extension of Sullivan in my view.

13

MS. HYNDMAN:

14

that respectfully, Justice Kennedy.

15

when you have the person who was the victim of the

16

discrimination, who was also, who was complaining about

17

the discrimination and then gets fired, he's in actually

18

a better position than the white homeowner was in

19

Sullivan.

20

It's part of his own contract.

Well, I would disagree with

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would say here,

When you agreed with

Justice Breyer that we're looking for a word that

question I asked your friend and I'll ask you as well.

19

I think you have a case under Sullivan, which

20

recognized, although it's 1982, this type of action.

21

But Sullivan would not come out the same way today given

22

Alexander against Sandoval and our new approach to

23

statutory interpretation.

24

stare decisis, which body of law do you give effect to,

25

the Sullivan case or our more recent cases on how to

So if you're concerned about

38
Alderson Reporting Company

1

read statutes?

2

MS. HYNDMAN:

I think you give effect to

3

Sullivan in this situation, and the reason is because at

4

the time that Congress was legislating and amending

5

section 1981, and it was acting against the backdrop of

6

this Court's jurisprudence, it had Patterson in front of

7

it, it had -- it knew that Sullivan was still good law.

8

It knew that this Court had repeatedly directed that

9

section 1981 and section 1982 be construed similarly;

10

and Patterson did not address the specific situation

11

that was in Sullivan, that is whether you could bring a

12

cause of action for retaliation.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, by 1991

14

our new approach to reading statutes was pretty clearly

15

established.

16

MS. HYNDMAN:

That's correct.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -

So if Congress were

18

looking at both of those bodies of law, then wouldn't

provision?

based upon what this Court had said in Patterson, and I

think under those circumstances it -- they wouldn't

statute such as the modern antidiscrimination statutes

JUSTICE ALITO:

And given that

You're saying they would

have -- you're saying they would have added an express

10

retaliation provision in 1981 in 1991 if they had

11

thought that the mode of reasoning in Sullivan was no

12

longer sound?

13

Is that what this comes down to?

MS. HYNDMAN:

I don't know that that's

14

necessarily true.

15

against the backdrop both of Sullivan and the lower

16

courts' consistent recognition of a cause of action.

17

I think they -- they legislated

JUSTICE ALITO:

When you say they legislated

something they didn't do, rather than anything that they

20

I wouldn't necessarily agree
I would -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

books.

Jackson was in 2005.

2

MS. HYNDMAN:

That's correct, Justice

3

Ginsburg; and at that time this Court said that you look

4

to the language of the statute, and there in Title IX

5

the language was broad.

6

discrimination, such as we have in section 1981 and

7

section 1982, and in fact the Jackson court relied on

8

Sullivan and relied on this Court's interpretation of

9

Sullivan to find that there was a cause of action for

10

It was a general ban on

retaliation under Title IX.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What I'm -- what I'm

12

taking away from the argument is that if I were to write

13

this opinion in your favor, I would have to say that

14

it's necessary to imply a cause of action prohibiting

15

retaliation in order to make these other words

16

effective.

17

and a very difficult argument for you to prevail upon,

18

given the authorities and the approach of the Court that

19

we've discussed.

20
21
22

And that seems to me a very limited argument

MS. HYNDMAN:

Well, the Court has already

implied a cause of action and the question is whether JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I understand that, and -

23

and there certainly is a cause of action as to all the

24

terms in the contract, but you want to add -- for me to

25

add a new term.

You can't use the existing terms to say
41
Alderson Reporting Company

that there is a cause of action other -- that helps your

2

client, other than that there is a general approach that

3

there is protection post-contract formation.

4

have to agree with that; and I don't think you can get

5

out of it impairment.

6

MS. HYNDMAN:

I would

Well, the language in this

7

statute that guarantees the same rights to make and

8

enforce contracts by citizens provides that basis, based

9

on this Court's decision in Jackson.

10

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now you're making

enforcement, as with Patterson.
MS. HYNDMAN:

I'm sorry.

I didn't hear -

I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now you're just talking

15

about make or enforce and that brings us right back to

16

where we started.

17

MS. HYNDMAN:

But -- subsection (b) defines

18

make and enforce more broadly.

19

of the language in section 1981(d), that was to make

20

clear that the terms make and enforce contracts cover

21

the entire contractual relationship, from the beginning

22

of the relationship to the end of it.

23

And that was the purpose

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To the extent your

24

argument relies so heavily on Sullivan, I went back and

25

read it, and rather than an implied right of action case
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it looked to me like a third party standing case.

2

MS. HYNDMAN:

And I know there is some

3

disagreement about that, but the Court in Jackson found

4

that -- it did find that Sullivan did stand for the

5

proposition that there was a cause of action for

6

retaliation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

that's right.

question.

10
11

But I think -

Now I get back to another stare decisis

Do I rely on what Sullivan actually said, or

I do I rely on Jackson's reinterpretation of Sullivan?
MS. HYNDMAN:

Well, if you look at what

12

Sullivan actually said, Chief Justice Roberts, I think

13

you would find that you could read it more expansively

14

that just a third party standing case.

15

white lessor, Mr. Sullivan, had been expelled from the

16

corporation after he advocated the rights of his black

17

lessee, Mr. Freeman; and he was allowed under -- the

Court allowed him to bring his action to recover damages

19

and get injunctive relief, because he himself was

20

expelled from that corporation.

21

that had an had injury in that circumstance.

22

that it's not -

23

In that case the

So he was the person

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I think

24

that the language in the opinion focuses on it as a

25

third party standing question.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. HYNDMAN:

The -- the Court says that

2

Mr. Sullivan does have standing to bring the action.

3

do agree with that, but if you read the entire opinion,

4

you would see that they also say that Mr. Sullivan had

5

the right to bring his action for damages and injunctive

relief.

7

I

Just to sum up, because this Court in

8

Sullivan and Jackson has recognized that persons who

9

themselves were not victims of discrimination must be

10

protected against retaliation when they advocate the

11

rights of those victims; otherwise the underlying

discrimination would go unchecked -- we are not asking

This Court has already inferred a private

before the Court now is simply the scope of the basic

you've already inferred.

And I think that's consistent
45

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Now, I think the

20

considerations of precedent as well speak very loudly

21

here.

22

cause the Court to interpret 1981 and 1982 differently?

23

And the answer is absolutely nothing.

these aren't just two closely related statutes that were

codified together.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you asking us to

against retaliation?

No.

We're asking to you

interpret the cause of action that exists -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What words -

to include

retaliation.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What words in the statute?

10

And not "impairment" because I don't agree with the

11

government on that.

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Okay, Justice Kennedy.

I

13

think part of the disconnect may be, if I could try to

14

address this, is there are two reasons you might think

15

that retaliation isn't covered.

16

think retaliation isn't covered is because it's not

17

discrimination on the basis of race.

18

that you might think retaliation is not covered and the

19

reason that the court of appeals, post-Patterson,

20

pre-1991, thought that retaliation wasn't covered was

21

simply that it was post-formation conduct.

22

that, what is clear is that 1981(b) provides a textual

23

answer to that.

respects.

It doesn't say "discrimination on the basis of race."

Now, to be sure, we're not saying that 1981

16

isn't a race statute; of course it is.

But those exact

17

words don't appear and don't provide a stumbling block.

18

And if you look at the form that 1981 takes, it doesn't

19

take the form of an express prohibition of

20

discrimination on the basis of race; it actually

21

textually takes the form of a guarantee of equal

treatment.

treatment quite naturally is violated not just by the

Judge Easterbrook's hypothetical of the equal

because I rather doubt that employer would have many

property owner's association.

how that's anything other than a retaliation holding.

And as I said, this Court on a number of occasions has

given 1982 holdings even stare decisis effect, using

those words in Runyon in the 1981 context.

When If we thought Sullivan was

Should we say

16

we accept it insofar as it interpreted section 1982, but

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. HAWKINS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HAWKINS:

Respondent and the government

and its amicus arguments are more appropriate on the

floor of Congress debating whether or not to amend

10

section 1981 to include retaliation.

13

definitions, the Seventh Circuit relied on extrinsic

14

issues to reach its decision in violation of Article 1

15

Section 1 of the Constitution.

16

instead of its judgment in violation of the principles

17

set forth in Jones versus Bock, where this Court had

It exercised its will

George Washington said in 1790 "I've always

21

been persuaded that the success of our nation and our

22

government depends upon the acceptance its people and

that that would depend upon the interpretation and
