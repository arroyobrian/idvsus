CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

v. AnimalFeeds International.

Mr. Waxman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Unlike courts, arbitrators derive their

12

authority solely from the consent of the parties to a

13

particular agreement.

14

That agreement determines not only what the

15

parties have agreed to arbitrate, but just as

16

fundamentally, with whom they have agreed to do so.

17

when the agreement reveals no intent, no meeting of the

18

minds to add participants, but the arbitrators

19

nonetheless extend their reach to hundreds of parties of

20

other contracts, they violate the basic principle

21

reflected in the FAA that their authority is created and

22

circumscribed by an agreement.

23

And

The decision to impose class proceedings is

24

not the kind of incidental procedural matter that

25

arbitrators have to resolve in order to discharge their
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

responsibilities under the foundational agreement.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, there's a

3

preliminary question in this case, and that is:

4

was one agreement, undoubtedly signed by both sides,

5

and that was the one to submit to the arbitrator the

6

question whether the arbitration clause permitted class

7

treatment.

8
9

The arbitrators answered that question,
which they were given authority to do so by both sides,

10

and the Second Circuit said that the arbitrators

11

answered within the ballpark.

12
13
14

There

If we agree with that, then there's nothing
else to consider in this case.
MR. WAXMAN:

I respectfully disagree,

15

Justice Ginsburg.

16

reflected in paragraph 7 of the supplemental agreement

17

-- that is, to proceed to arbitration under the auspices

18

of Rules 3 through 7 of the AAA rules, and Rule 3 itself

19

contemplated precisely submitting precisely the

20

contract issue that the Bazzle plurality said should go

21

to the arbitrators.

22

clause itself, does it objectively reveal an agreement

23

among the two parties to permit or prohibit class or

24

consolidated treatment, or is it truly silent?

25

The arbitrators -- the agreement

That is, looking at the arbitration

That is a question of contract
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretation.

That is the question that was submitted

2

to the arbitrators.

3

There is a separate statutory question that

4

arises if the answer to the contract question is number

5

3.

6

silent --

There is no meeting of the minds.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. WAXMAN:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is truly

But there is no such answer.

Excuse me.
I thought, in contracts,

10

there is no such answer.

11

and it doesn't say, you try to figure out -- I used to

12

be taught that; probably I am way out-of-date -- you try

13

to figure out what a reasonable party would have

14

intended.

When you interpret a contract

15

MR. WAXMAN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17
18

Justice Breyer -And I thought that's what

Bazzle said, that -MR. WAXMAN:

I very -- I very much doubt

19

that you are way out-of-date.

20

think where I am.

But let me be clear --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. WAXMAN:

24
25

If you are, I shudder to

Not as out-of-date.

I hope I am as up-to-date as I

need to be to provide a coherent, correct answer.
My proposition is twofold, and only the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

second part gets to your question.

2

The first is that the arbitrators in this

3

case decided the contractual question, the -- did the

4

parties have a meeting of the minds, yes or no?

5

so, was it?

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. WAXMAN:

And if

Yes.

And the arbitrators then went

8

on to say:

Even though there is no meeting of the minds

9

objectively revealed, nonetheless we are going to apply

10

a background rule that puts the burden on the party

11

opposing arbitration to prove that there is an intent to

12

preclude.

13

So, we're establishing that the --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

but there are two separate questions.

16

MR. WAXMAN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

I see that now, but then --

Exactly.
My question was, first, the

same as Justice Ginsburg.

19

MR. WAXMAN:

And I have an answer --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I have a question for

21

you on that, because in reading these briefs, I thought

22

your description of who is to decide this matter of

23

whether there is to be a class action was just what you

24

said:

25

for the parties.

The question of who should decide it is a matter

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. WAXMAN:

The question --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So when I looked at -- I

3

just have been reading Bazzle three, five times, and there

4

seemed --

5
6

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, you are nowhere near up

to me, then.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But what it

8

seems to say is that that's a matter to figure out from

9

a contract and background circumstances.

10

the contract was:

11

contract.

12

In Bazzle,

Any -- all disputes relating to this

Here, it doesn't say that.

It says:

"Any

13

dispute arising from the performance, termination, or

14

making of the contract."

15

Now, a class-action determination does

16

relate to.

17

an argument.

Maybe it doesn't arise out of, okay?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

That's

No, no, no -So why are all these briefs

20

saying that what Bazzle said was:

Whenever this is

21

silent, it goes to the arbitrator; the who question is

22

answered at arbitration.

23

I can't find it saying that.

24

MR. WAXMAN:

25

No, no, no.

What -- and I -- I'm

interpreting the plurality opinion that you wrote -- or
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you and three of your colleagues.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

what I actually thought doesn't matter.

4

what is said.

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, I know.

Okay.

I know.

But

What matters is

Well, our

6

understanding -- what Bazzle said is, at the very

7

beginning of the opinion -- look, here's the case:

8

South Carolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration

9

clause is truly silent, and it then applied a rule of

10

State law that says, if it's silent, class treatment

11

will be permitted.

12

to decide whether that rule of South Carolina law

13

applied to this case is precluded by the FAA, which

14

requires actual consent, not coercion.

15

The

We granted certiorari in this case

Now, what the plurality in Bazzle, with

16

respect, said is:

17

the statutory FAA question on which we granted review,

18

because we can't be certain that the contract really is

19

silent.

20

Bazzle -- the Bazzle plaintiffs say that it is silent,

21

and Green Tree says, no, if you look at other words in

22

it, including the right to choose each arbitrator for

23

each arbitration, it's not -- the South Carolina courts

24

answered the question, but they are not the ones,

25

because when you are talking about a question of the

We can't reach the legal question,

To be sure, there's no express provision, but

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretation of a contract that has committed to

2

arbitration, that is for the arbitrators to decide.

3

arbitrators have to decide whether there was actually a

4

meeting of the minds.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

Now, you're -- so the

6

answer to Justice Ginsburg's question is, as to the who

7

question, who shall decide whether or not in your case

8

class actions are permissible?

9

MR. WAXMAN:

10

And the --

JUSTICE BREYER:

The who question in Bazzle,

11

because of the contract and background, was the

12

arbitrator.

13

MR. WAXMAN:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- yes.
The who question here,

15

irrespective of the contract is the arbitrator for the

16

reason that Justice Ginsburg said.

17

saying:

You are the who; you, arbitrators, are the who.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

There's a separate

Yes.
So now we look to the what.

They then decided it.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Exactly.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in Bazzle --

What -- what did they decide?

23

And you are saying that's wrong.

And there you run into

24

all the authority, Misco, who used to be in other

25

places, saying when the arbitrator says something,

unless it's in Marrs, follow it.

2

addressing.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

That's what you are

Exactly.

And -- and this

4

case presents exactly the same answer to that question

5

that Bazzle presented when it was granted review; that

6

is, there is -- there was an interpretation of the

7

contract in Bazzle, and an application of a legal

8

principle to that interpretation.

9

what the parties actually intended is the arbitrator.

The who for what --

10

That's what the Bazzle plurality, together with Justice

11

Stevens, both decided.

12

The question that arises, the legal question

13

that arises, only if the arbitrators say there was no

14

meeting of the minds:

15

us to apply as a matter of Federal law?

16

courts, and you didn't reach it because the preliminary

17

question of whether the contract was really silent, the

18

predicate question, wasn't answered.

19

for that --

20

So what rule does the FAA allow

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

preliminary question?

22

authorized class arbitration.

23

permissible?

That is for

And you remanded

Mr. Waxman, can I ask this

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would you agree that was

If it expressly authorized it?

MR. WAXMAN:

If it expressly authorized

2

class participation, obviously, we would have no

3

argument that the parties had not agreed to it.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand, but would

5

you agree that would be consistent with the law, to

6

enforce such a provision?

MR. WAXMAN:

My -- I have a --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

statute prohibit that kind of provision?

10

MR. WAXMAN:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

MR. WAXMAN:

That is, does the Federal

No, certainly not.
Oh.

I mean, the only reason -- the

13

only reason I'm hedging -- and I don't mean to hedge, but

14

trying to be thoughtful -- is that this Court explained

15

in Mitsubishi, in the context of the arbitration of a

16

Sherman Act agreement, and subsequently in Gilmer and

17

other statutory cases, that in determining whether class

18

participation or some other form of remedy is or isn't

19

available, there is a two-part inquiry.

20

The first part is:

21

the arbitration agreement?

22

have agreed --

23

What was the scope of

What is it that the parties

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And you would agree that

24

if they phrased their order a little differently and

25

said we think that the best reading of this agreement
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is that the parties intended to authorize class

2

arbitration, then you would have no case?

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Then we would have review only

4

under the -- I don't know that I would characterize it

5

this way, but what Justice Breyer characterized, the

6

Marrs standard of review; that is, you would have to

7

-- you are not arguing that that would be manifest -MR. WAXMAN:

No, our -- and the petition in

15

this case presented the question as given, presented the

16

issue of contract construction as given, that the

17

contract itself was silent, not only in the sense that

18

it didn't include an express provision or prohibition,

19

but also that it reflected no meeting of the minds.

20

objectively revealed no meeting of the minds, looking

21

not only at the actual text of the contract, but also

22

looking at the other indicia -- objective indicia of

23

intent that courts use to --

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

It

What, in your view --

what, in your view, were the arbitrators asked to decide
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

by the submission by the parties?

2

MR. WAXMAN:

The arbitrators were asked to

3

decide whether the arbitration agreement objectively

4

reveals consent to prohibit, permit -- whether it

5

reveals a meeting of the minds to prohibit class

6

treatment, permit class treatment, or whether it was

7

truly silent.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

MR. WAXMAN:

10

Didn't you just --

And if you look at --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Didn't you just say that the

11

parties agreed that there was no meeting of the minds on

12

this issue?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, no, no, no.

The

14

parties that -- I mean -- we actually -- let me step

15

back and give -- and give the history of it.

16

This case arose immediately in the wake of

17

Bazzle.

Okay?

They sued in court; we obtained an order

18

affirmed by the Second Circuit sending them to

19

arbitration.

20

at Bazzle, and we decide -- like the AAA, which has

21

filed an amicus brief in this case, and said it drafted

22

these rules in order to provide a procedure to answer

23

the Bazzle contract interpretation question; the AAA

24

says, we don't have any view about the statutory

25

question that arises from silence -- so we drafted a

Bazzle is decided, and we're all looking

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

supplemental agreement that, in paragraph 7,

2

incorporates the AAA Rules 3 through 7.

3

And the AAA Rule 3, which is included on

4

page 56 of the joint appendix, is headed "Construction

5

of the Arbitration Clause."

6

arbitrators in this arbitration to determine, quote, "on

7

construction of the arbitration clause, whether the

8

applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to

9

proceed on behalf of or against a class."

10

And it requires the

The, quote,

"clause construction award."

11

Now, the legal -- the arbitrators in this

12

case concluded that it neither permitted nor prohibited,

13

either by its express terms or by reference to other

14

objective indicia of intent --

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm a little bit puzzled.

16

don't understand how something -- if you ask

17

whether something permits it, and if it doesn't prohibit

18

it, doesn't it a fortiori permit it?

19

MR. WAXMAN:

It -- in the context of the

20

Federal Arbitration Act, which this Court has made clear

21

more times than I can remember that the central purpose

22

is to ensure that private agreements to arbitrate are

23

enforced according to their terms, the question is:

24

Have the parties agreed to it if there is a meeting of

25

the minds?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

I

If no meeting of the minds is objectively

What is your understanding

of what Mr. Persky says at 77a of the joint appendix?

10

He was -- I take it he was counsel for AnimalFeeds?

11

that right?

12

MR. WAXMAN:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Correct.

Is

He --

And he says all the parties

14

agree that when a contract is silent on an issue, there

15

has been no agreement that has been reached on that

16

issue; therefore, there has been no agreement to bar

17

class arbitrations.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.

I --

So then I don't understand

20

what issue there was for the arbitrator to --

21

arbitrators to decide --

22

MR. WAXMAN:

They --

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- other than to impose a rule

24

like the rule that had been adopted by South Carolina.

25

But that would not be within their power, unless they
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could presumably find that rule in Federal maritime law

2

or New York law.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

Correct.

I mean --

So what was the issue for

them to decide?

6

MR. WAXMAN:

So here's was -- here's what the

7

issue was.

They said the contract is completely silent

8

and, as you quoted on page 77, the part -- there's no

9

meeting of the minds on this issue at all.

That was

10

their position about the construction of the contract.

11

Our position about the construction of the

12

contract was that, in fact, although there is no express

13

provision one way or the other, this is a maritime

14

contract, and the -- and maritime law is ascertained by

15

custom and practice.

form of affidavits that were unrefuted that since the

Now --

10

MR. WAXMAN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. WAXMAN:

No.
They won't?

In -- in the -- in the context

13

of -- in the context of a court that has jurisdiction

14

over a dispute and exercises coercive power, it has to

15

get to an answer.

16

When you are talking about private

17

arbitration, where the model is a private agreement to

18

resolve things between two parties, this -- under the

19

FAA, the arbitrators get their authority only as to

20

matters as to which there is consent.

21

And there is -- going to Justice Alito's

22

question, there was consent.

It was submitted for

23

purpose of determining whether -- if you look at the

24

contract and look at background rules and look at parol

25

evidence and look at custom and practice, can you
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discern whether, as -- as you put it in -- in the

2

opinion in Howsam, Justice Breyer, whether the contract,

4

parties.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

7

to come to a decision, but so does an arbitrator.

8

really -- I really don't understand what it means to say

9

that the contract does not cover it.

10

That's no different.

But that's the same before
I mean, yes, a court has
And I

I mean, the -- the

contract either requires it or does not require it.

11

And if the contract is silent, either the

12

court or the arbitrator has to decide what is the

13

consequence of that silence, in light of the background,

14

in light of -- of implied understandings.

15

consequence of the -- of the silence that a class

16

arbitration is permitted, or is the consequence of the

17

silence that it is not?

Is the

18

But those are the only answers.

19

contract requires it or the contract doesn't require it.

20

I don't know anything in between -- the contract is

21

silent.

22

or the arbitrator to decide what that silence means.

23
24
25

The

If the contract is silent, it's up to the court

MR. WAXMAN:

Exactly.

And -- and maybe the

ambiguity here is the fluidity of the term "silence."
"Silence" can mean there's no express
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provision.

"Silence" could also mean, well, if you look

2

at other words in the text of the contract, you can't

3

work your way through to conclude that there was in fact

4

an intent.

5

It also may mean -- and this is the sense

6

that I am using it in, and I think the sense that the

7

arbitrators have authority to do, is to say, well,

8

let's look and see, for example, if there is custom and

9

practice that would inform the backdrop against which

10

the parties negotiate.

11
12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and why is it that

you say an arbitrator cannot do that, but a judge can?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

No, no, no, I think an

14

arbitrator can.

15

subject to manifest disregard review, to decide whether

16

or not there was a meeting of the minds of the parties.

17

And it can use the text of the statute; it can use an

18

applicable background principle of governing law; it can

19

use principles like contra proferentem, as this Court

20

did in --

21

The arbitrator has plenary authority,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But are they situated and

22

do they have the same authority as a court would in

23

determining that issue, given the fact that it was

24

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. WAXMAN:

But --

I'm sorry -- in this case, we

said the contract was not truly silent, that --

essentially, we argued what Judge Rakoff concluded.

15

They said:

17

ask the Court, if you have it, to turn to page 22 of our

18

blue brief, because on page 22 of our blue brief we have

19

reprinted exactly what AnimalFeeds told the arbitrators

20

were the reasons why they should win, in light of Mr.

Or was silent.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, that's not what they

said there, is it?

That -- that the parties agree they're

5

silent -- that whether they -- if they are silent,

6

whether they permit or preclude class action. Those are

7

the two alternatives that they were confronted with.

8

They decided that it did not preclude; ergo, it

9

permitted.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12
13
14

Well -That's what the answer to

that on page 49a is.
MR. WAXMAN:

No, with -- with respect -- and

I'll -- let me answer this question --

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MR. WAXMAN:

You --

-- before getting back to the

17

-- what that -- what -- look, you -- you may find,

18

contrary to the cert grant in this case, that the

19

predicate of our petition is wrong.

20

Our petition is predicated on the

21

understanding that the arbitrators found that the

22

contract was truly silent; that is, it expressed no

23

meeting of the minds.

24

presents the question --

25

And, therefore, this case

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the question you were

23

asked was whether that silence should be interpreted as

2

a preclusion or a permission.

3
4

MR. WAXMAN:
arbitrators' decision --

5
6
7

And we know from the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You said there was a

permission.
MR. WAXMAN:

As -- as a background rule,

8

that's what they said.

What they said was, they --

9

first of all -- and we are looking at page 52 -- they

10

acknowledge the force of the argument, quote, "that the

11

bulk of international shippers would never intend to

12

have their disputes decided in a class arbitration."

13

But they said, well, we can deal with that later in

14

deciding whether they can opt in or out.

15

I mean, the point is that if you have to opt

16

in because it's clear that you never agreed, there is no

17

meeting of the minds.

18

Secondly --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, may I

ask you -- because your time is running and we are

There is one fundamental flaw, it seems to

me, in your argument, and I'd like you to answer it.

parties' intention.

set up --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't that a

4

critical difference, though?

5

fundamental question in -- before getting arbitration

6

is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate this

7

dispute with this party.

8
9
10

I mean, I understood the

And it's one thing to say that the contract
permitted this sort of arbitration; it's another thing
to say it didn't preclude it.

11

MS. PILLARD:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's right.
And if it didn't

13

preclude, the contract may not preclude -- if I agree --

14

I guess it's the -- well, if I agree to arbitrate with

15

A, it doesn't preclude me from arbitrating with B, but

16

nothing in the agreement compels me to do that.

17

So which did the arbitrators do?

Did they

18

say, under this contract, you agreed to a class action

19

treatment, in the sense that -- whether it's the

20

language or the intent or whatever -- or did they say we

21

don't find anything here that precludes class action

22

treatment?
MS. PILLARD:

23

Mr. Chief Justice, they did

24

the former.

And let me point you to -- on page 50, what

25

they relied on was the broad language of the agreement,
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the language "any disputes."

2

drew on the breadth of that language and on the fact

3

that many other arbitrators had read similar language to

4

permit class arbitration.

5
6

And in particular, they

And so those other --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

me this -- I see they have quoted from --

7

MS. PILLARD:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Yes.
-- from the agreement.

Where is that in the agreement itself?

10

MS. PILLARD:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MS. PILLARD:

13

Would you show

The "any disputes" -Yes.

-- language?

In the agreement

itself?

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MS. PILLARD:

If you know offhand.

Is -- the agreement is

16

reproduced in Appendix F of the petition appendix, which

17

starts on page 67a, and the arbitration clause is on

18

page 69a.
Now, it's clear that the arbitrators

19
20

rejected the notion that they should permit --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, this is -- I'm

22

sorry.

This is what I was wondering.

23

any dispute arising from -- blah, blah -- performance,

24

termination of this charter party shall be settled in

25

New York.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

It is, of course,

Official

1

Now, there's -- the class is not a party to

2

this charter party.

So disputes arising from this

3

charter party doesn't involve the class.

4

not agree to arbitrate with the class.

So they did

5

Now, as I understand what the arbitrators

6

did, they said, well, they didn't preclude it, and so

7

we get to decide how far our authority goes.

8
9

MS. PILLARD:

I'd like to address that

directly, Mr. Chief Justice.

The arbitrators

10

specifically rejected the notion that they should adopt

11

as -- as a default rule.

12

we had actually argued that they should, they rejected

13

our argument.

14

And that's on page 49a.

Where

Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear

15

language that forbids class arbitration in order to bar

16

it; the panel, however, agrees with Respondent.

17

So they are saying:

We are not going to do

18

this based on a default rule; we are going to do this

19

based on the language and intent.

20

Right?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, now -- now --

21

I'm sorry.

I'm just reading along here.

They rejected

22

your argument about "forbids," but the -- they go on to

23

say:

24

see whether they intended to permit or to preclude class

25

action.

The issue -- we look at this, we look at that to

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. PILLARD:

Right.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's enough for

3

them if the parties did not intend to preclude class

4

action.

5

MS. PILLARD:

I -- I respectfully disagree.

6

They go on and they read any disputes to authorize --

7

now, it's not to require class action.

8

important that that be clear.

9

I think it's

It's to put the class action mechanism --

10

or, to read the contract, that the class action

11

mechanism is in the arbitrators' toolbox.

to choose procedures.

It's

It's not necessarily going
So it's

Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In -- in any -- in

17

any case -- when you say "arbitrators' toolbox," I'm

18

trying to figure out if that is something different than

19

what the parties agreed to.

20

MS. PILLARD:

No, by agreeing to arbitrate

21

any disputes, the arbitrators found that they were given

22

the authority to use class arbitration, among other

23

procedures, if they were appropriate in the particular

24

case.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It -- it seems to me

34
Alderson Reporting Company

that the arbitrators are putting the choice in a false

2

manner.

3

to permit it or, on the other hand, they agreed to

4

prohibit it.

5

have agreed to permit it.

It isn't whether, on the one hand, they agreed

6

Just forget about the latter.

Not simply, they did not

You don't have to agree to
You have to agree to

That's what contracting is about.
MS. PILLARD:

That's right.

I'd like to

12

point to two aspects of the opinion that I think clarify

13

this.

14

The one is their reference to the language

15

on page 50a, the panel is -- and they are talking about

16

the language in the context of the other arbitration

17

precedent, or the other arbitration opinions that had

18

developed at that point under the AAA arbitration

19

scheme.

20

broad wording "any dispute" to be significant, and the

21

fact that other arbitrators looking at that language

22

also found "any dispute" to encompass the choice of this

23

procedure.

And they are saying the -- they find that the

24

Now, I think it was Justice Alito --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, no, I mean, they --

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they put it just -- just the way that -- that is not

2

good for you.

3

Respondents have been unable to cite any post-Bazzle

4

panels or arbitrators that construed their clauses as

5

prohibiting a class action."

6

"The panel is struck by the fact that

That's not what -- what they have to find.

7

They must find positively that it permits a class

8

action.

9

MS. PILLARD:

And it's our contention -- and I

10

think it's clear -- that they found that it was

11

permitted.

12

And when you see that following -JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

that says that.

14

that says it.

15

Just give me some language

I -- there is nothing in that paragraph

MS. PILLARD:

16

"any dispute" -- now, they reject the notion -- they

17

expressly have rejected the notion that they are

18

supposed to do it as a matter of default.

19

And then I just want to address this

20

language, which I think could be confusing, at the

21

bottom of 51a, where they say they don't establish that

22

the parties -- this is the last paragraph on 51a:

23

Respondents' evidence "does not establish that the

24

parties intended to preclude class arbitration."

25

You might read that as supporting the
36
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

argument that you are proffering.

2

that the arbitrators meant that, that once they had

3

established under the "any disputes" language that there

4

was affirmative general authorization on the part of the

5

arbitrators to choose any procedures, to have this in

6

their toolbox, then in order to overcome that, you would

7

need to -- and the Petitioners were trying with their

8

maritime experts -- to show an intent to preclude.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

However, I believe

So the only language you

10

can point to is that -- is that "any dispute" language

11

on 50a?

13

MS. PILLARD:

That's right, and I think

that's very important.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You are hanging your whole

15

-- your whole assertion that -- that these arbitrators

not only found that the contract did not prohibit it,

but found that the contract positively authorized class

18

action, upon that language on 50a?
MS. PILLARD:

19

Together with the language on

20

21

you need is the absence of language forbidding it.

Uh-huh.

I think -- I don't see the

language here in this contract, but they could try to do

20

that.

21

There's nothing in the FAA that bars it.
And, you know, as we've emphasized, the

22

contract interpretation, under ordinary contract rules

23

that the FAA has consistently applied in -- and this

24

Court has consistently applied to the FAA in -- in many,

25

many cases -- it's ordinary contract law we're talking

2

Now, I just think one thing -- when we are

3

thinking about contract law, which is ordinarily in the

4

province of the States, I think it's important that the

5

New York Appellate Division, in Cheng v. Oxford Health

6

Plans, has since approved just such an arbitrator's

7

contract interpretation under New York law, allowing

8

class arbitration under a 1998 pre-Bazzle clause --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MS. PILLARD:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Allowing.

-- like this one.
Allowing.

See, that's

12

where I get hung up.

13

in arbitration -- and it's a fundamental difference --

14

between allowing something and a background rule that

15

requires it if you don't say anything about it.

16

There's a difference

The difference I see with the hypothetical

Justice Breyer put is that you are talking about the

details of a contract once it's agreed there is a

20

relationship between the employer and the employee, and

21

you're trying to figure out if it says anything about

where they eat lunch.

There's a contract that governs the

This is the much more fundamental issue of

whether you've even agreed to arbitrate with this

2

And I think what your brother's position is,

3

is that this is just somebody who came off the street;

4

5

them.

6

I didn't agree to do anything with

MS. PILLARD:

Well, I think, Mr. Chief

7

Justice, that that goes back to whether any disputes can

8

plausibly be read to encompass the class mechanism,

9

because if it can, well, then, by agreeing to that

10

contract, you have, in effect, agreed to something that

11

delegates to the arbitrator the ability to use that.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MS. PILLARD:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MS. PILLARD:

So --

So when you picked -I -- I --

-- your arbitrator you picked

16

your arbitrator knowing that.

17

extra notice, right, because this case had been filed

18

in court as a class action?

19

these arbitrators -- and you can tell by the caliber of

20

arbitrators they picked -- that they knew this could be a

21

class arbitration, and so they are picking people who

22

are up to that task.

And here, they had

They knew when they picked

23

Now, they also know that they are going to

24

dispute that, but if we're right that the arbitrators,

25

plausibly and under the -- the Marrs standard of
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

judicial review, have -- have sustainably interpreted

2

this contract to give the arbitrators the authority to

3

proceed on a class basis, well, then, I think your

4

objection --

5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
that's what it comes down --

7
8

MS. PILLARD:

-- Mr. Chief Justice,

disappears.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's what it comes

down to --

11

MS. PILLARD:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- whether it's an

Right.

13

interpretation of the contract to give the arbitrators

14

the authority to proceed on a class basis.

15

Not enough, right, under your view, if

16

there's nothing in there that precludes them from doing

17

so?

18

MS. PILLARD:

I think that's a question of

19

State law.

For example, under the State law at the time

20

in South Carolina, what the South Carolina Supreme Court

21

found in Bazzle was that the contract was silent, but

22

the -- applying two rules of contract construction,

23

contra proferentem -- well, one rule of contract

24

construction and one FAA rule, which is the Moses H.

25

Cone rule, the court said:

We find this contract
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

authorizes it.

Right?

So there was contra proferentem.

2

There was also, which I haven't mentioned

3

and I should, the Moses H. Cone rule, which says when

4

there's any ambiguity about the scope of issues that

5

have been given to the arbitrator, we put a finger on

6

the scale in favor of giving the issue to the

7

arbitrator.

8

maybe that only is about contract issues, where the

9

court in JLM said, no, it's antitrust, too --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what -- what

happens --

So if it's unclear, any disputes, well,

MS. PILLARD:

-- and the arbitrators say

procedure, too.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What happens if you

15

get the arbitrator on the stand, and he says:

16

the contract, it doesn't say -- and nothing about the

17

intent of the parties leads me to believe they meant --

18

you may arbitrate this on a class basis, but at the

19

same time there is nothing in there that says you may

20

not.

21

and background rules, and nothing there says you may

22

not.

23

As we read

And I looked at the intent of the parties

What do you understand to be the answer?

24

they proceed on a class basis or not?

25

MS. PILLARD:

I understand that to be

and if so, what is it?

16

MS. PILLARD:

The -- what I'm looking to,

17

and I'm not sure this is going to be the best cite for

18

you, but in the Petitioners' reply brief, they say,

19

I -Because I haven't been

5

6

asked to answer, but I thought there would be some

7

document saying we've agreed to this supplemental

8

arbitration agreement, which is going to define what the

9

answer -- what is the question you have to answer.

10
11
12

I understand what they say they were

Right.

Well, the supplemental

agreement does -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because I don't think,

13

that -- from what I've been able to read, I don't think

14

they were ever asked the question whether the agreement

15

authorizes class action or class procedures.

16

only asked to decide whether it either permitted it or

17

precluded it, but is that what the question really was?

18

MS. PILLARD:

They were

Now, "permitted" I think they

19

take to understand as "authorize," and the reason -- and

20

this is something that the court, in the context of

21

Sixth Circuit Dub Herring case, says -- they explain why

22

do we use the language "permit"?

23

We use it because they are not saying

24

whether we are actually going to use this power; we are

25

just saying this power is available to you.
51
Alderson Reporting Company

But I

Official

1

think, for purposes of whether the contract is giving

2

the authority to the arbitrators, that "permitted" means

3

"authorized."

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

See, as I understand it,

5

in the supplemental agreement, they were asked a

6

question about the meaning of the underlying arbitration

7

agreement.

8

MS. PILLARD:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
But I can't find what that

10

specific question was, which seems, to me, answers the

11

whole case, if we could find out what it is.

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's a supplemental

agreement here because I thought --

14

MS. PILLARD:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
-- in reading this, the

16

supplemental agreement submitted the case under Rule 3

17

--

18

MS. PILLARD:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Yes.
-- of the AAA, and it's

supplement --

21

MS. PILLARD:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- rule 3 of the AAA

23

supplementary rules says, an arbitrator shall, quote,

24

"determine, as a threshold matter, in a reasoned,

25

partial, final award, on the construction of the
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

arbitration clause, whether the applicable arbitration

2

clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of

3

4

MS. PILLARD:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Thank you.
So I thought the

supplemental agreement said --

7

MS. PILLARD:

8

JUSTICE BREYER: -- apply Rule 3, and

9
10

Thank you.

therefore, it was asking the arbitrators to decide the
question put in Rule 3.

Is that right?

11

MS. PILLARD:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

I think that's correct, yes.
So then we could get the

question by reading page 7 of the blue brief.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

bound by your decision?

7

MS. PILLARD:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10
11
12

I would say no.
You would say no.

And the reason is?
MS. PILLARD:

He doesn't have an arbitration

agreement with you.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not that I -- he

13

doesn't have any arbitration agreement with me or that

14

it's not the same arbitration agreement?

15

MS. PILLARD:

He doesn't have an arbitration

16

agreement that has the same language, that has -- the

17

same or substantially similar language giving the

18

arbitrator the authority to use class procedures.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Let's say the intent

20

is pertinent when we enter into the contract, okay?

21

there's good evidence about what you and I meant the

22

contract to mean, and there's not any evidence about

23

what Mr. Waxman and I meant the contract to mean.

24

we've got an arbitration clause in both cases.

25

And

Say

Can we arbitrate -- can I be required to
56
Alderson Reporting Company

1

arbitrate Mr. Waxman's contract with -- along with the

2

one that you and I have entered into?

3

MS. PILLARD:

I think your question is

4

getting to we have evidence of subjective intent here

5

and none there, but the New York law, as is the law in

6

many jurisdictions, is an objective intent standard, so

7

you look to the language as evidence of intent.

8
9

And on this intent question, I did just want
to respond to a question that Justice Alito had asked

10

Mr. Waxman about Mr. Persky saying there has been no

11

agreement that has been reached on this issue, which is

12

in the joint appendix, the buff-colored appendix, on page

13

77a.

14

Now, he clarifies in the next sentence that

15

what he -- what he is speaking to there is there has

16

been no agreement to bar class arbitrations, right?

17

this is in the context of disputes over whether this

18

maritime expert witness testimony is going to be

19

admitted.

20

pages later, at page 79a of the joint appendix, Mr.

21

Persky expressly makes the argument that we believe the

22

arbitrators adopted, which is that the arbitration

23

clause here contains broad language, and this language

24

should be interpreted to permit class arbitrations.

25

at the end of the following paragraph he continues:

But

And I think it's very clarifying that two

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So

What page -- what page are

you quoting from?

6

MS. PILLARD:

I'm -- I'm sorry.

I'm quoting

7

from the buff-colored joint appendix at page 79a around

8

the middle of the page and then in the following

9

paragraph.

10

So he's clearly making the argument here,

11

and he doesn't make it in the brief that Mr. Waxman

12

cited.

13

And I think the arbitrators correctly

14

rejected the -- the Respondents' framing of that issue

15

and actually went further, as they say in their opinion.

16

They didn't think that those were adequate grounds to

17

rule for the Respondents, for us.

18

to find an intent in the contract.

19

does make that argument, which I think is the winning

20

argument, here on page 79a.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They thought they had

provision saying no class action -- you cannot proceed in

not proceed on behalf of a class, would that preclude

4

you from bringing a class action any place?

5

If the arbitration agreement says

MS. PILLARD:

I think it would if -- and if

6

the -- that might be the exact kind of fact situation

7

that if the arbitrators somehow ignored that in reading

8

the contract and said, oh, you -- we still have the

9

authority to authorize a class, that is the kind of

10

thing that under this very deferential standard of

11

review might be exceeding their powers.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There are many, many

13

contracts -- and pick up your average credit card

14

agreement -- that will say you may not bring this as a

15

class.

MS. PILLARD:

Many such contracts, and

17

indeed there are contracts that started doing that back

in the '90s.

you win this case, but then all the future AnimalFeeds

MS. PILLARD:

That's right.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Three points, so I will

take 25 seconds for each point.
First of all, these contracts in the class

22

are not all the same.

These are form contracts that are

23

drafted by the charterers and their brokers, and they

24

involve different clauses, including different

25

arbitration clauses.

1

The second point, the Rule 3, I think,

2

fairly does encapsulate the question that the parties

3

presented to the Court, which is to construe the

4

contract, the question that the Bazzle plurality sent

5

back.

6

commend to the Court, on behalf of no party says over and

7

over and over again, we drafted the rules to provide

procedures to answer the Bazzle contract question.

statutory question that arises if the answer to the

11

-- the meeting-of-the-minds question is no meeting of the

12

minds as a matter of contract law.

13

And if you find -- and much of the

14

discussion this morning has focused on this -- that,

15

well, somehow the arbitrators did just decide the

16

meeting-of-the-minds question, they didn't decide the

17

legal consequences of no meeting of the minds, then just

18

as in Keating and as in Bazzle, you will not be able to

19

reach the very important, fundamental FAA statutory

question in this case.

really a meeting of the minds here?

3

let me just say that when Ms. Pillard says, well, we

4

don't know whether the parties in this industry agreed

5

or disagreed, all of the -- the evidence was undisputed

6

that since the days of Marco Polo the background
