CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Danforth v. Minnesota.

Mr. Butler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. BUTLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. BUTLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, the Minnesota Supreme Court

11

held that this Court had prevented it from deciding for

12

itself which State prisoners can go into Minnesota State

13

courts to raise Federal constitutional challenges to

14

their conviction.

15

This is incorrect.

A State court is free to fashion -- the

16

State courts are free to fashion their own jurisprudence

17

as to who may raise a Federal constitutional question in

18

State court in the context that if you hear State courts

19

and State legislatures can make their own policy

20

decisions about the costs and benefits of allowing State

21

prisoners to challenge their otherwise final convictions

22

based on new rules of Federal constitutional criminal -

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I propose if the

24

State of Minnesota really cared about this, it could

25

have its own confrontation rule.

Does it have a

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

confrontation rule?

2

MR. BUTLER:

The State constitution, Justice

3

Kennedy, has a confrontation clause.

4

on the confrontation clause, its own, is identical to

5

this Court's jurisprudence.

6

Petitioner could always go in and make a State court

7

challenge to his State court conviction.

8

--

9

So, yes, theoretically, a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
necessarily tied in knots.

11

substantively what it chooses.
MR. BUTLER:

The question

That means the State isn't

10

12

Its jurisprudence

It has the option to do

The question in this case, Your

13

Honor, I think, is that whether -- is the question of

14

whether it has to.

15

State court challenge to his conviction.

16

is, does he have to?

17

challenges his conviction under the Federal

18

Constitution.

19

Yes, a State prisoner can make a
The question

In this case, Mr. Danforth

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, page 2 of your reply

20

brief, the yellow brief, you take issue with the State,

21

and you say the State is wrong if there is a decision

22

either way on the confrontation clause and it's

23

questionable under Federal law, we can review it.

24

concede that's right, but that doesn't get you home.

25

That's the problem.

1

MR. BUTLER:

Well -

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That is the problem.

3

You're now creating a regime in which State courts are

4

reaching questions that we said ought not to be reached

5

for final convictions.

6

MR. BUTLER:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8
9

Your Honor And that was the basis on

which we decided Crawford.
MR. BUTLER:

Your Honor, it's simply a

10

regime under which the State court, as it can in any

11

number of other contexts, can choose to consider the

12

merits of a litigant's claim.

13

the Federal question here is -- well, there are two.

14

this case, it's whether Federal law prevents the State

15

court from hearing it, but the substantive Federal

16

question is whether Mr. Danforth's conviction violates

17

the confrontation clause.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Federal question -

And you think that our

19

holding in Teague was that it did, but we're not going

20

to let you out of jail?

21

MR. BUTLER:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think You think that's really

23

what we said in Teague, that even though your

24

constitutional rights were violated, we're going to

25

foreclose the remedy of habeas corpus?
5

Alderson Reporting Company

I -- I find it

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difficult to believe that that -- you know, any

2

responsible court could make such a determination.

3

MR. BUTLER:

Your Honor, what the Teague

4

Court did was set up a procedural and a prudential limit

5

on a defense available for the State in the particular

6

form of habeas corpus.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That issue is not a

8

necessary part of your case at all, but you don't have

9

to suggest that you could depart.

You could do less

10

than Teague.

11

that as a given because it doesn't touch your case.

12

Isn't that so?

13

For example, Griffith.

MR. BUTLER:

You can accept

That's correct, Your Honor.

14

Griffith sets forth, as we see it, the minimum

15

requirements of Federal law, that a new rule must be

16

applied to all cases that were pending when the new rule

17

is announced.

18

requires.

19

That's what the Federal Constitution

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Federal rules

20

don't have minimums and maximums.

They have a rule.

21

And as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you can have a State

22

rule under the State constitution that goes further.

23

seems to me that the States' determination to apply

24

Crawford retroactively must be based on a disagreement

25

with this Court's Teague analysis, which refers back to
6

It

words, the disagreement at bottom is a disagreement

3

about how to read the substantive requirements of

4

Crawford.

5

MR. BUTLER:

So, in other

Respectfully, Mr. Chief

6

Justice, I don't think that's necessarily true.

I think

7

the disagreement, if there is one, is with this Court's

8

policy decision in Teague to -- that the Court announced

9

in Teague as to whether to allow such challenges.

10

There's no disagreement as to the substance of Crawford

or to the substance of the Sixth Amendment.

23

Is it something else?

And the court makes a

And what you're arguing for is discretion in

MR. BUTLER:

What we're arguing for,

24

Mr. Chief Justice, is discretion in the State to

25

disagree with the general policy rule that a court will
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not consider a new rule when considering the validity of

2

a conviction on, in Teague's case, habeas or on

3

collateral review.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's a general policy

5

rule, but it may well, as in the Crawford case, as a

6

good example, have affected this Court's initial

7

determination to strike off in a new direction.

8

so knowing that there's a possibility that we wouldn't

9

upset final convictions.

10

MR. BUTLER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We did

Well And I think it is -- to that effect.
Is it not a substantive

14

determination of Federal law when you say that this

15

constitutional change that we're making in this case or

16

that we have made in a past case is not retroactive?

17

That means there was no constitutional violation in the

18

past prior to the announcement of this case, and what

19

the State -- what you want the State court to be able to

20

say is yes, there is a Federal constitutional violation

21

for which we're going to give a remedy in habeas.

22

MR. BUTLER:

I think, Justice Scalia and

23

Justice Kennedy, if I could address your points in turn,

24

on Justice Scalia's question about whether there was or

25

was not a constitutional violation, if the Court is
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

really holding that there was -- that something -- that

2

there was no constitutional violation at the time

3

Petitioner's conviction became final or at the time

4

Mr. Bockting's conviction became final in the habeas

5

case, then what the Court is really holding is that

6

Crawford didn't just interpret the confrontation clause;

7

it somehow changed the confrontation clause, that the

8

confrontation clause meant -- that the confrontation

9

clause said one thing at one point and now says

10

something else.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think that's exactly what

12

Crawford means, and I think that's exactly what

13

happened.

14

rule.

15

used to be the rule, but it is the rule after this case.

16

That's what it means, whether it's a new

What does a new rule mean?

It means it didn't

Now, you can argue, and there are many

17

originalists who would agree with you, that there

18

shouldn't be such a thing as a new rule, but once you've

19

-- once you've agreed that there can be new rules, if

20

this Court says this is a new rule, we acknowledge it

21

wasn't the rule before, but it's new, it will not have

22

retroactive effect, it seems to me that the State would

23

be contradicting that ruling by saying oh, in our view

24

the law used to be exactly what you say it newly is.

25

MR. BUTLER:

But the question, Your Honor 9


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But your basic position is

2

that we should not be making new law.

3

we might have misinterpreted the law over the years,

4

but, basically, this Court has no power to change the

5

text of the Constitution or its meaning.

6

Justice Scalia's position is we have all that power in

7

the world.

8

(Laughter.)

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

We should be -

I guess

My position is we have

asserted all that power in the world.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is -- there is

13

-- it's not as though we have a new rule, and we apply

14

it from this day forward.

15

least for cases that are not yet final.

16

on trial, Crawford wasn't there, but maybe somewhere

17

toward the end of the appellate process, lo and behold,

18

they can take advantage of it.

19

When they were

So it's a question of where you want to cut

20

it off.

21

in a different place?

22

Crawford is retroactive at

And at one time, didn't this Court cut it off

MR. BUTLER:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did.

23

In fact, for centuries everything this Court did was

24

always retroactive, as the Court knows.

25

And then we got the Linkletter balancing
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

test, and then later on we got Griffith and Teague, and

2

the Court has refined, usually through the scope of

3

Federal habeas corpus -

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And during the period

5

between Linkletter and Griffith, did the State -- if the

6

Supreme Court said that a decision was not retroactive,

7

did State supreme courts feel free to apply it

8

retroactively?

9

MR. BUTLER:

It -- there -- there doesn't

10

seem to be any case law on that point, Your Honor, that

11

I'm aware of.

12

usually followed this Court's retroactivity decision.

13

But it is unclear whether they thought they had to or

14

whether they just chose to.

15

State courts usually, as they do today,

The question -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can a State -- can

16

they pick -- can a State pick and choose?

17

that we are going to allow Crawford claims to be applied

18

retroactively, but other claims, we're not going to?

19

MR. BUTLER:

Can it say

I think, when it -- if you

20

consider, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Teague rule is a

21

procedural rule about who gets to make what claims, then

22

I think the answer to your question is yes.

23

court could say -

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The State

Well, and if you

think that the Teague rule is an assessment of the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

substantive -- part of the substantive constitutional

2

interpretation, an assessment about what the impact of

3

Crawford is versus other decisions, then I guess they

4

couldn't, right?

5

MR. BUTLER:

Well, it depends on the impact

6

in what -- in what setting, Your Honor.

7

the Teague rule -- and Teague, itself, and every case

8

this Court has ever -- in which this Court has ever

9

considered Teague, has come from one procedural posture:

10

Federal habeas corpus review of State court convictions.

11

It -- the -

It is over that posture that this Court

12

exercises both supervisory power and control to

13

interpret the various Federal habeas statutes.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, even -- even outside

15

of the habeas context, we -- we decided a case, Hudson

16

v. Walker, one or two terms ago.

17

case.

18

violation, the exclusionary rule does not apply.

19

would be too costly an extension of the exclusionary

20

rule and would bring the -- would make the Fourth

21

Amendment a disruptive force.

22

It was a no-knock

We said that, even if there is a no-knock
This

Under your view, I take it, the State, even

23

in -- in its trial proceedings subject to direct review,

24

could disagree with that and take a Federal concept,

25

no-knock, and then apply the exclusionary rule, thereby
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

forcing us to make the -- to draw the very lines that we

2

said we ought not to draw in Hudson.

3

MR. BUTLER:

No, Your Honor.

4

First of all, what Hudson -- the Hudson case

5

asked was whether exclusion of evidence was required

6

under the Fourth Amendment when the violation of the

7

Fourth Amendment was a no-knock violation.

8
9

The word "required" appears throughout the
opinion in Hudson, and the answer was no, it doesn't.

10

The Fourth Amendment doesn't require exclusion of

11

evidence.

12

But there was no suggestion in -- in Hudson

13

that the State court could not then say, here is a

14

Fourth Amendment violation.

15

what the remedy is.

16

to suppress the evidence, so we are -- we either choose

17

not to -

18

We need to come up with

The Constitution doesn't require us

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but you agree with

19

me, then, that under your position, the State could

20

apply an exclusionary rule.

21
22
23

MR. BUTLER:
State law.

Yes, Your Honor, it could under

And if CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Based on the

24

distinction between right and remedy, a distinction that

25

is -- that in countless areas of the law we -- we have
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

said is -- is an ephemeral one?

2

MR. BUTLER:

Well, the -- that is not based

3

on that distinction.

That is one way to look at it,

4

Mr. Chief Justice, that in -- in the Hudson context, it

5

is definitely a question of right and remedy.

6

There's no question in Hudson that the

7

defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated.

8

question is what remedy is required by the Constitution.

9

Here, Mr. Danforth wants the Minnesota State

10

Court to consider whether his constitutional rights were

11

violated.

12

that it could not consider the merits of his claim

13

because of Teague.

14

It did not hold that they were not.

The

It held

And in other settings this Court, in its

15

other limitations on the availability of habeas corpus,

16

has described these prudential rules like Teague as

17

gateway claims.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Butler, let me -- this

19

is a habeas case, but I assume the same issue could come

20

up in a -- in a direct appeal to the State Supreme

21

Court.

22

State can determine to be retroactive constitutional

23

rights that we have said are not retroactive, on direct

24

appeal, now, not habeas?

25

Is it your position that in a direct appeal, the

MR. BUTLER:

As long, Justice Scalia, as the
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State acknowledges that it is using State law to do so,

2

that it is -- that it is not mismanaging this Court's

3

retroactivity jurisprudence.

4

it doesn't think, well, we -- we must do this.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In other words, as long as

If it bases its decision on

6

the Federal Constitution, and we have said that this

7

Federal constitutional rule is not retroactive, what -

8

what do they say on a direct appeal?

9

MR. BUTLER:

10

On a -- on a direct -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And my next question is

11

going to be whatever they say, when it comes up to us,

12

what do we do?

13

MR. BUTLER:

14

the facts of the case, Your Honor.

15

It would -- it would depend on

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm -- I'm confused on

16

this one, because I thought it was part of our

17

retroactivity jurisprudence that the States must apply

18

that new rule while the case is still in the pipeline,

19

while it is on direct appeal, not that they -- well,

20

they just may, but they absolutely must apply it

21

retroactively.

22
23

MR. BUTLER:

That is, Your Honor, what

Griffith says, and that's -- that's what -- that's -

I thought that's what Griffith said.

Alderson Reporting Company

Okay?

And it comes up to the State Supreme Court.

2

the State Supreme Court, despite the fact that we've

3

said the decision is not retroactive, make it

4

retroactive?

And your answer is yes?

5

MR. BUTLER:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. BUTLER:

8
9

Can

My answer is Habeas or not?

My answer, Your Honor, is that

if the -- the JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If it comes up after -

10

if the prosecution is after the Federal decision, of

11

course, the decision has to apply.

12

MR. BUTLER:

Yes, I think that's correct,

13

Justice Ginsburg.

14

prosecution starts after this Court announces a new rule

15

and then says that it is not retroactive -- when you

16

announce that it is not retroactive, it is not

17

retroactive to cases that are already final.

18
19
20

The decision would apply.

If the

If the case hasn't even begun yet, then, of
course -- then, yes, then the new rule would apply.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does your -- does

21

your approach apply to legislative enactment's as well?

22

Let's say Congress passes a law and it provides as

23

particular remedy, and it says this remedy shall not be

24

retroactive but only apply in new cases.

25

Can the State say well, we think it ought to
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

apply to old cases, pending cases on habeas, or

2

whatever, and so we are going to apply this

3

retroactively, even though Congress said it's only

4

prospective?

5

MR. BUTLER:

I think that's a -- that's a

6

somewhat different question, Your Honor, and it would -

7

it would depend on if -- if Congress passed a law that

8

said no State court shall apply retroactively something

9

or other -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

They just

11

say here's a new remedy, maybe a glance and exclusionary

12

remedy in cases where we have held one isn't required -

13

can the State allow that retroactively, even though

14

Congress -- a Federal remedy, even though Congress has

15

said this Federal remedy is only prospective?

16

MR. BUTLER:

In the past, Your -- I think -

17

I think the short answer to your question, Mr. Chief

18

Justice, is yes.

19

because, if you look at, for example -- if this is a

20

question of remedy, then I -- then the State courts have

21

all the power to grant more remedies, to grant more

22

expansive -

23

And I think the reason it can is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, your reliance

24

on this ancient distinction between right and remedy -

25

I mean if Congress says you don't have a remedy if it's
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

retroactive, it's hard to say what kind of right you

2

have.

3

MR. BUTLER:

If, Your Honor -- think about

4

the -- the tax cases, for example, American Trucking and

5

McKesson, the case -- the companion case.

6

those cases, especially McKesson, the Court held that

7

where there has been a violation of somebody's

8

constitutional rights and the -- and the State owes that

9

person some sort of a remedy, then the State can give

In both of

10

whatever remedy the minimum requirements of the Federal

11

Constitution or Federal law are, but can also go

12

further.

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure, as a matter of

State law.

15

MR. BUTLER:

Yes.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But here you are

17

arguing in favor of retro-application of Federal law.

18

There is no issue -- as Justice Kennedy pointed out, you

19

can have a State confrontation clause and do whatever

20

you want with it.

21

provision.

22

But you are relying on the Federal

MR. BUTLER:

What -- what we are relying on

23

-- we are relying, Mr. Chief Justice, on the substance

24

of the Sixth Amendment, yes.

25

claim Mr. Danforth makes.

That is the substantive

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

But you are also

2

relying, as I understand it, on State common law, in

3

effect.

4

common law does not give less by way of remedy and

5

relief than the Federal decision requires, the State is

6

free, as a matter of State remedial common law, to do

7

more.

And you are saying, that so long as the State

That's your point, isn't it?

8
9

MR. BUTLER:

That is absolutely my point,

Justice Souter.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You are saying that,

11

ultimately, the State's choice in this case rests upon a

12

choice of State common law about procedure leading to

13

remedy.

14
15

MR. BUTLER:

It is not even just State

common law, Justice Souter.

16

It is state statutory law.

No.

have thought the very least Teague is, is Federal common

In other words, this is the Federal law of
I think it is more than that.

I think it is

But it's at least Federal common

MR. BUTLER:

Only, Mr. Chief Justice, if the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State court interests.

remedial question of does this person have a right to go

3

to State court and challenge his conviction, that is

4

quintessentially the matter of State law.

5

And when it comes to the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That always assumes that

6

that's a remedial question, and that the question is not

7

was the Constitution violated at the time this act

8

occurred.

9

acknowledge that the State can't change the situation.

10

That -- if that's the question, then you

MR. BUTLER:

That's true, Justice Scalia.

11

That if this Court -- if Teague is a rule that says what

12

the Constitution was at a particular time, then it is

13

much harder for us, we would probably have to make a

14

State law claim.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you can say -- it

16

is a little odd that the State executive can say, yes,

17

as far as we're concerned, we like the new law, or what

18

was always the law but the Court wasn't perceptive

19

enough to see that, we like it, so we're not going to

20

raise Teague.

21

that the executive of the State is not bound by Teague,

22

but the courts are?

23

It would be an anomaly, would it not,

MR. BUTLER:

That's correct, Justice

24

Ginsburg.

That's prosecutorial discretion.

MR. BUTLER:

No, Justice Scalia,

respectfully, I don't think that's true.

If the law at

there's no confrontation violation, and we go to State

State chooses to say we don't want to apply Teague,

No, Justice Kennedy, I don't

When you weigh and balance the interests,

Mr. Butler, if as you say

Teague is, in effect, a comity rule, then what is your

answer, in effect, to Justice Scalia's point that we

19

make a decision when we come down with a substantive

20

legal judgment about the Constitution, we make a

21

decision as to whether the rule is retroactive or not?

22

And he says that if you look at Teague as simply, in

23

effect, a comity decision, that's inconsistent with the

24

determination that we have made, because if you say

25

okay, we as a State will apply it earlier than the Feds

say we have to, you, in effect, are changing the

2

substantive determination that we have made, that the

3

decision is not retroactive.

4
5

What is the retroactivity analysis that
underlies your comity analysis of Teague?

6

MR. BUTLER:

The retroactivity analysis,

7

Your Honor, when this Court makes a decision is that, as

8

Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier, Griffith.

9

says when it makes a new rule, when it announces what it

The Court

10

believes to be a new rule, that it knows that it will

11

apply to a certain group of cases.

12

It doesn't know -- it can't know anything

more than that, because the Court doesn't exercise

control over other courts -

application under Griffith?

Alright, but let's be more

What does it know about retroactive

18

MR. BUTLER:

That it will apply.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And it will apply to some

20

cases that depend upon facts and have eventuated from

trials that are -

22

MR. BUTLER:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

So that there's is

going to be some retroactivity?
MR. BUTLER:

Yes, absolutely.
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if there is going to be

2

some retroactivity, then I take it your position has got

3

to be and is our substantive decisions are not so much

4

retroactive or non-retroactive, but retroactively

5

applied, to some extent, and not retroactively applied

6

to others, and a State is free to apply it more

7

retroactively than ours.

8
9
10

Is that the nutshell?

MR. BUTLER:

That is the gravamen of our

argument, Justice Souter.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

So your answer to Justice

11

Scalia is, I take it, not that the decision is

12

retroactive or not, but there is a decision about the

13

degree to which applications will be retroactive or not?

14

That is what underlies your case?

15

MR. BUTLER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then do you think the State

17

is free to decide how and when and whether it will,

18

quote, apply?

19

the application of the law seems to me no answer at all.

I mean, simply to separate the law from

20

Is there any other area where you say well,

21

yes, there was a Supreme Court decision; but whether to

22

apply that decision is up to the State?

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You're overlooking what I

24

understand to be the basic distinction you're drawing.

25

I know the Chief Justice has cast doubt on it.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

But I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think there is a basic distinction between rights and

2

remedies.

3

And you're holding -- I understand your

4

position to be that the remedy may not be retroactive,

5

even though the decision itself can assume that there

6

would have been a violation from the beginning of the

7

Constitution today we may have misinterpreted before.

8

But if there is a violation of the right, then there's a

9

decision about what kind of remedy shall be imposed.

10

And you can say we will not impose a remedy

11

for past wrongs, even though we must impose them in the

12

future and we can let other states decide whether to

13

post a remedy or not.

14

with the holding that the violation is always

15

retroactive, but the remedy may not be.

16

MR. BUTLER:
Stevens.

And that's totally consistent

I think that's correct, Justice

When you talk about remedy CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- it is the other

way around which makes it problematic.

You're going to say where we have decided that there is

no remedy and, therefore, if you have a right, it's -- I

don't know what you get out of it -- you want to say,

no, there is a remedy.

disagree with this Court's interpretation of the Federal

earlier about knowing the scope of the application of a

And the answer to that, I believe, is that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK C. DIAMOND

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3

MR. DIAMOND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

Federal law controls the retroactivity or

6

non-retroactivity of new constitutional rulings.

7

Court determines the constitutional requirements -

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This

May I ask you, just at the

outset, when you use the term retroactivity, are you

10

saying there was no violation of the Constitution before

11

the decision, or there just is no remedy for it?

12

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, I think in this -

13

this Court has made it clear in the retroactivity area

14

that retroactivity is a question of the substantive

15

constitutional standard that will applies to a specific

16

defendant.

Is it your view that at that

don't believe this is a matter of remedy.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

This Court,

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

for example, in Reynoldsville Casket wrote that Teague

2

itself is not a limitation on remedy.

3

limitation on the principle of retroactivity itself.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What it is, is a

Is part of that because of

5

what's involved in expectations?

6

where we said the determination of whether a

7

constitutional decision is retroactive Is every bit as

8

much a question of Federal law as the decision of the

9

substantive right itself.

10

MR. DIAMOND:

That's the Smith case,

We said that in Smith.
Yes, Your Honor, and the point

11

is that the substantive rights and retroactivity are not

12

two different things.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And here the

14

expectation -- in Smith it was the expectation of people

15

in the private sector.

16

finality of judgments.

Here the expectation is one of

17

MR. DIAMOND:

Exactly, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then how do you -- how do

19

you reconcile that answer with the point that your

20

brother made just before he sat down, and that is,

21

taking standard Griffith analysis, the application of a

22

so-called new rule is going to vary depending on how

23

long it takes a person on direct appeal to get through

24

the State court system?

25

And it seems to me that that is inconsistent
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with your view that there has got to be one rule with

2

respect to the date of application as a matter of

3

substantive Federal law, because we know for a fact

4

that, depending how long it takes to get through the

5

State appellate system on direct review, the new rule

6

may be applied and it may not be applied.

7

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, two points:

First

8

of all, I think Griffith is very clear, that finality is

9

that point.

Griffith is very clear, and it defines

10

finality as that point when the direct appellate process

11

has run, and this Court -- and the opportunity to

12

petition this Court for review is over.

13

II, a retroactivity case from this Court, says that it's

14

up to the Federal courts to define finality.

15

in Banks II there was a question of whether the

16

Pennsylvania courts passing on waiver requirements

17

somehow destroyed the finality of -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Secondly, Banks

Remember

I understand your -- your

19

point about finality, and finality has a well-known

20

operative effect.

21

Federal courts have defined finality and have said it is

22

not final until -- a case is not final until direct

23

review is over -- one consequence of that is that a

24

substantive Federal rule will be applied to an

25

individual in one State whose crime and whose trial

But one operative effect when the

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

procedure is different in time from that of a defendant

2

in another State.

3

So that the consequence is that the

4

substantive rule will apply to some people who acted on

5

date X and it will not apply to some people who acted on

6

date X; and that, it seems to me, is inconsistent with

7

your answer to Justice Stevens's question.

8
9
10
11

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, given the varied

proceedings at the State level, that -- that is
inevitable no matter what time this Court JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if it is inevitable, I

12

don't see how you can answer Justice Stevens's question

13

the way you did.

14

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, the point in

15

Griffith is that in terms of uniformity, this is -- in

16

terms of providing similarly situated people, the best

17

the Court can do in this area is to cut -- to make the

18

point at finality -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the finality point in

20

effect establishes a way of calculating the application

21

of a rule in any given State in any given case, but it

22

will not result in the uniform application of the rule.

23

Isn't that correct?

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

have to say that's correct.

Yes, that's correct.

You

2

MR. DIAMOND:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And But I think you can also

4

explain that the reason it's correct is the Court

5

probably would have liked to say yes, we're making up a

6

new rule; the Constitution didn't use to say this; and

7

this rule will apply from now on to all actions taken by

8

individuals from now on.

9

Harlan says my goodness, you're going to give relief to

But then, you know, Justice

10

this individual and not give relief to other individuals

make an equitable exception for that.

You have to treat them equally.

So we will

But basically, the existence of that

15

exception does not prove that the Court was not

purporting to make a substantive rule.

exception to the application of that substantive rule

for pending cases, which is totally understandable.

There's an

Which, Your Honor, is Griffith

and is defined by Federal law.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can you give me an example

of a case in which this Court candidly said, we're

23

announcing a new rule which was not the law before?

24

Aren't we always interpreting what we thought the intent

25

of the framers was from the beginning, even though we
34
Alderson Reporting Company

a new rule, in the sense it's a different rule of law as

point -- this isn't Blackstone -- Blackstone is not the

a competing concern, but the point -

The point is that finality is -- is not

Finality is a condition

for fashioning the right remedy.

not to the violation.

There's no doubt.

But that all goes to remedy,

Don't we call it a new

rule in Teague?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- expectations as being

questions of remedy?

MR. DIAMOND:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that your

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- your answer to Justice Souter's question earlier

2

should be that there is uniformity.

3

fast, some are slow, but in the end there is a final

4

judgment which is a settled expectation, and the

5

substance of the law honors settled expectations, which

6

is finality.

7

MR. DIAMOND:

Some States are

Your Honor -- and that point

8

is -- the point of finality is a recognized point of

9

what is necessary for the integrity of judicial

10
11
12
13

decision-making.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's sort of like

defining order as random order, isn't it?
MR. DIAMOND:

I disagree, Your Honor.

I

14

think that as Justice Harlan said in the -- in the

15

Williams and Mackey dissents, there is -- a decision

16

that is always subject to revision is really the

17

functional equivalent of no decision at all.

18

makes judicial decisions judicial.

It's what

And -- and the concern is a

concern not so much.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the concern is not so

22

much a concern not so much for the defendant here but

23

for the States, isn't it?

24

there is -- there is an important value implicit in

25

habeas, and one of those values is that there be a limit

We don't want -- we think

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

to the degree to which we are going to upset the settled

2

expectations of the States.

3

MR. DIAMOND:

Isn't that right?

Your Honor, the State's

4

interest here can be vindicated by the State by applying

5

State law.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's not the point.

7

thought that Teague was driven not by some abstract

8

notion about finality, but the intrusion on State

9

decision-making.

I

Here was State that had conducted an

10

entire process that appeared to be in line with what the

11

Federal law then appeared to be.

12

told by some Federal habeas court, State, you've got to

13

do it all over again, because you didn't -- you didn't

14

predict that we were going to interpret the Constitution

15

differently.

16

of Teague was it addressed the Federal forum and said,

17

Federal forum, don't step on the States' toes, don't

18

make them redo trials that have long since been over.

19

And then the State is

I thought that the really motivating idea

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, I'm here

20

representing the State of Minnesota, and the intrusion

21

that I'm concerned about in this case is a State court

22

judge adopting some Federal optional -- sort of Federal

23

requirement, and applying it as opposed to using State

24

law that can be reviewed and overturned and for which

25

that State court judge is accountable to the citizenry
37
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I must say I have

3

serious problems with your position in that regard.

4

If you were not to prevail in this case

5

and -- or, pardon me, if the Petitioner were to prevail

6

in this case, and there were a ruling on what Crawford

7

means, or doesn't mean, we could review it.

8

Petitioner is absolutely right on that point.

9

MR. DIAMOND:

I think the

Your Honor, I think that it's

10

difficult.

If you look at, for example, the recent case

11

in Minnesota, Krasky, dealing with essentially the same

12

evidence that's at issue in this case, if the State was

13

adopting Krasky as some State standard, then this Court

14

wouldn't be in a position to review it.

15

adopting Krasky as a -- as the Federal standard, then

16

the question is, how is it that the State is adopting

17

something as a matter of the Federal Constitution that

18

is not a Federal constitutional requirement?

It's a matter of Federal law.
But the question is, what's the content of

24

the Federal law?

Does the Federal law say to the States

25

-- State, in a collateral review proceeding, you want to
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

apply Crawford retroactively to people whose convictions

2

were long ago, do it, we don't care?

3
4

And a lot of Teague says that should be the
Federal rule, if it's called a Federal rule.

5

But then you said a different thing, in

6

answer to Justice Stevens.

The different thing was but

7

the substantive rule of Crawford only takes effect as of

8

the day of Crawford and into the future.

9

Now, on that position, or take any other

10

date you want as one year earlier or whatever you're

11

going to pick there, if you're right about that, you

12

win.

13

But how could you be right about what I call

14

there a metaphysical point?

15

as Justice Souter just pointed out, imagine three people

16

who have three identical trials each one year before

17

Crawford.

18

wins.

19
20

Because on the metaphysics,

The first person is called Crawford, and he

The second person is called Smith, and he's
delayed forever in the appeals process.

21

And the third person is called Jones, and he

22

get a quick appeal, convicted, in jail at the time of

23

Crawford.

24
25

Now we know that the first two Crawford
applies to, but metaphysically, if the law of Crawford
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was the law at the time of the first two trials, why

2

wasn't it the law in terms of what the rights are in

3

respect to the third person whose trial was held at

4

precisely the same time?

5

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, the point I think

6

is that this is a point that Griffith makes, that when

7

your conviction becomes final, that your stake -- if I

8

can call it that -- in changes in the law come to a

9

close.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I agree with that.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You are saying

12

metaphysically this Court has no power to enunciate new

13

constitutional rules metaphysically, but we have done

14

so, and Teague is full of references to new rules.

15

therefore hold that implicit in the retroactivity

16

approach we adopt today is the principle that habeas

17

corpus cannot be used as vehicle to create new

18

constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those

19

rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants."

20

The opinion is full of new rules.

21

So -- so, you know, we have violated

"We

22

metaphysics already.

Having violated it, in adopting

23

new constitutional rules, why should it be any surprise

24

that we also violated it in the application of those

25

rules?

There should be no surprise at all.

hung up on metaphysics, Mr. Turner.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In Crawford itself, it

4

history long before the original interpretation of the

5

clause.

making up new rules.

I guess that was unnecessary because we were
Is that the -

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

You've adopted Justice

Scalia's approach through your silence, and I'd ask you

10

whether -- whether -- whether there isn't just a simpler

11

explanation that doesn't require us to go into Spinonza,

12

Immanuel Kant, or even Aristotle.

13

explanation would be simply what Justice Stevens started

14

with, that Teague is about remedies, and that we assume

15

that the law was the law at the time of Crawford's

16

trial, at the time of Smith's trial, and at the time of

17

Jones' trial.

18

And the simpler

But Jones is knocked out because he went to

19

habeas.

20

therefore, if the State wants to apply Crawford

21

retroactively, let everybody out of jail, that's their

22

problem.

23
24
25

And that's what Teague is about.

Or their virtue.

Habeas.

And,

That's up to them.

That's where Justice Stevens started, and
that's what I would like to hear an answer to.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You wouldn't want to say

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, Mr. Turner, because that would place you in the

2

position of saying what we are telling people in these

3

Teague cases is oh, yes, the Constitution was violated,

4

but we don't want to hear about it.

5

alternative, to acknowledge that the Constitution is

6

violated in all of these Teague cases, some of them

7

being capital cases, and we nonetheless say well, too

8

bad, it's on habeas.

9

I mean that's the

I'd like to think that's not what we're

10

doing, that what we're saying is, this is a new

11

constitutional rule, there was no constitutional

12

violation before, and that's why we're letting it stand.

13

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

handling these questions very well.

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18
19

I think you're

That was not a question

addressed to you, Mr. Diamond.
MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, I think that, in

20

terms of Teague as a remedial limitation, first of all,

21

I don't think this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence

22

at all supports that notion.

23

I also think, for example, while certainly

24

not directly at issue in the habeas area, in construing

25

habeas, this Court said that Teague was not so much
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about a standard of review as it was about the standard

2

that applies itself.

3

to square the notion of Teague as a remedial limitation

4

with this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence.

5

And so I think it's very difficult

It's also difficult to square it with the

6

explicit rejection of that notion in American Trucking

7

and in Harper and Reynoldsville Casket.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You do recognize, though,

that one of the propelling forces behind Teague and why

10

we changed from the Linkletter regime was respect for

11

State courts' processes and the resistance to the heavy

12

hand of Federal habeas courts telling States what to do.

13

It seems a little ironic then if you take an

14

opinion that was driven by the Feds staying out of the

15

State courts' territory to say oh, no, we're going to

16

tell you that it's not -- we control when we want to.

17

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, certainly that was

18

one of the things that was going on in Teague.

19

respectfully, I think the question -- it's every bit as

20

intrusive on the State process when a State court judge

21

applies a new Federal rule to overturn a conviction, as

22

it is when a Federal court judge does the same thing.

23
24
25

But,

In other words, those comity concerns apply
regardless of forum.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Isn't what you are saying

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is that the concern in Teague was not only with State

2

court processes, but with settled expectations of those

3

who are involved in the criminal system, particularly

4

victims who are entitled at some point to rely on a

5

conviction being final?

6

MR. DIAMOND:

Yes, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We don't usually think of

8

just of settled expectations as being questions of

9

remedy.

10
11

We consider those as being questions of

substance.
MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, I think if you

12

look at Justice Harlan's writing in Teague about the

13

post-conviction -- what should be the rule for

14

post-conviction, you see he lays out very eloquently

15

what those concerns are in terms of finality and

16

uniformity in the post-conviction arena.

17

saying is that those concerns -- certainly comity is a

18

concern; but those other concerns in terms of finality

19

and allocation of judicial scarce criminal justice

20

resources and what kind of a trial are you going to have

21

11 years after the fact, is it going to be more fair

22

than the trial that occurred in the first place, all of

23

those -- apply.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

upset all those expectations.

And what I'm

-- State executives can
The State executive says

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I want this -- the issue -- the substantive issue in

2

this case settled, so I'm not going to raise Teague.

3

And so Crawford is going to be retroactive because I say

4

so.

5

that power but not the State court itself.

It is a bit of an anomaly that the prosecutor has

6

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, first of all, I

7

think the State court is in a business -- is in a

8

different role in terms of enforcing the constitutional

9

rights in that situation.

In fact, as it relates to the

10

constitutional right, it is difficult to see what State

11

interest a judge should be vindicating at that point.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It is also difficult to

13

see what Federal interest is vindicated when the State

14

says we know we have to respect this -- call it what you

15

want -- new precedent in cases still in the pipeline,

16

and we don't have to if the case has reached a final

17

judgment.

18

even if you want to."

19

But "not required to" doesn't say "can't,

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, that brings me

20

back to the point where I started, which is that the

21

Constitution doesn't -- remember, we're using the

22

Federal Constitution here as authority to do something

23

that, for example, in this case the Minnesota Court

24

would be otherwise unable to do.

25

This defendant never raised the State law

We let person A take advantage of it,

Why don't we let the State take advantage of

it in its collateral proceedings if the State wants to,

for reasons of federalism, for reasons they can do what

18

they want, for reasons if it is going to be the law in

19

the future any way?

MR. DIAMOND:

21

the State can take -- the State can do that as a matter

22

of State law.

extend the Federal standards here, is that the Federal

source of that rule?

constitutionally mandated rule?

10

The Teague rule is a Federal rule What is your understanding of the

I will give you one other decision, cover it
all at once.

11

And if it were not a judge-made rule, and

12

rather, it was a statute and it goes beyond regulating

13

Federal habeas corpus proceedings and effects State

14

court proceedings, what provision in the Constitution

15

would have given Congress the authority to enact such a

16

statute?

17

MR. DIAMOND:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19
20

Your Honor, let me Interpreting it the way

you interpret it.
MR. DIAMOND:

Let me try the first question,

21

and then we will see where we go.

I think the source

22

of -- the authority for Teague is, frankly, the same

23

source for authority as it is for Griffith, and as the

24

same source of authority as in Griffith.

25

about -- the best I can do for that is Griffith talks
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Griffith talks

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about it being grounded on basic norms of constitutional

2

adjudication and the integrity of the judicial decision

3

making.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

Federal system.

6

State system come from?

7

Which qualifies for the

Where is the authority to regulate the

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, I disagree in

8

terms of that that all applies only in the Federal

9

system.

If you look at, for example, the civil cases,

10

American Trucking, Reynoldsville, and Harper, they

11

talked about that same basic norms of constitutional

12

adjudication applying in the State forum as well.

13

I'm sorry.

There was a second part to your

14

question which was in terms of Congress being able to

15

amend or modify Teague in some fashion?

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

Where would Congress

17

get the authority to require State courts to follow the

18

rule, the interpretation of Teague that you're advancing

19

in this Court, that they may not go beyond the decisions

20

of this Court?

21

authorizes the Federal government, either judges or

22

Congress, to tell State courts that they cannot do what

23

your opponent argues they should able to do?

24
25

What under the Federal Constitution

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, I don't believe

that that's what's going on in the Federal habeas
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute.

I think this Court has said that -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I agree when you are

3

talking about what Federal court can do -- administering

4

a Federal habeas corpus.

5

where does the Federal authority to tell State courts

6

they cannot do what your opponent says they should be

7

free to do?

8
9

MR. DIAMOND:

I have no problem.

I'm asking

Your Honor, I guess my source

of confusion with your question is I don't understand

10

Teague is a rule from Congress.

11

a rule of this Court in terms -- describing what the

12

Constitution -- what constitutional standard applies to

13

what defendant.

14
15
16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand Teague is

In Federal habeas corpus

proceedings, yes.
MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, that's where the

17

point of agreement is.

I think Teague does many things,

18

but one of the things Teague does -- and, frankly, not

19

just Teague, the whole retroactivity jurisprudence of

20

this Court, Griffith and Teague together set up a

21

coherent whole.

the problem with it is in the constitutional design

itself.

requirements.

9

Griffith and Wharton together, Wharton saying Teague

In terms of the Constitution provides
You don't have to get into Teague.

10

exceptions don't apply to Crawford, those two cases

11

together basically say the State's requirement to

12

provide this new constitutional rule ended when this

13

defendant's conviction became final.

14

At that point, that is the constitutional

15

requirement.

16

States are not free as a matter of Federal authority to

exceed that requirement.

18

authority to do that.

19

certainly do it as a matter of their own authority.

20

the Constitution, for example, this defendant having

waived his State claims, having not raised them, the

2

you can't do that, because it goes beyond what the

4

MR. DIAMOND:

Or will they say, no,

Your Honor, I think that if

5

that remedy is grounded in State laws, the State of

6

Minnesota could certainly do that.

7

they can rely on the Federal Constitution to fire any

officer who does that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I don't think

Could a -- could a State

say:

We know that Federal habeas, the Fourth Amendment,

is out.

Fourth Amendment, right, not only to cases on direct

18

review but to collateral review as well?

19
20

Federal habeas courts can't do it, but could

21

MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, I think the answer

22

to that is probably yes, and the reason is different,

23

though.

24

the rights that the person is entitled to.

25

The reason is the States -- we're not changing

What we are -- what you're changing -- that
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is -- that is the remedy-and-right question again.

2

-- and what I'm saying is that what Teague -- Griffith

3

and Lorton together say that this person's

4

constitutional right, the right that he had, was fixed

5

when his conviction became final, as opposed to the case

6

where you -- that you're postulating, which is the

7

question of, yes, the State's going to recognize the

8

Fourth Amendment right in its post-conviction -- does

9

the right -- the content of the right, itself, is not

And

changed in that instance.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Diamond, let me ask you

12

a question.

13

off the point of the Federal Constitution, I guess.

14

That is, if Minnesota really wants the rule that you

15

want it to have, its legislature can provide that that

16

will be the rule, can't it?

17
18
19

Let me ask you a question which is totally

The Minnesota legislature can pass a statute
saying nobody gets more than Teague allows.
MR. DIAMOND:

Your Honor, I don't think the

20

Minnesota legislature could -- could go into the

21

pre-finality area.

22

legislature -

23

In other words, the Minnesota

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Can the Minnesota

24

legislature say:

Look, the -- the Supreme Court of the

25

United States has -- has come down with some rules.
52
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

won't characterize them as minimums or anything else.

2

We'll just say it's a set of rules.

3

and Teague is going to be the law for the application of

4

Federal rights in Minnesota State courts.

5

Minnesota legislature do that?

6

MR. DIAMOND:

It's called Teague,

Is -- can the

Your Honor, I think, in that

7

instance, the Minnesota legislature -- I see my time is

8

up, but I think in that instance the Minnesota

9

legislature is -- is providing the minimum that the

Constitution requires.

So the answer to -

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. BUTLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

Two quick points in my -- in my one minute:

21

On finality, the State court can weigh the

22

costs and benefits of upsetting the finality of its own

23

conviction, convictions rendered in State court and

24

appeals rendered in State court.

25

It can decide, as several States have, that
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the interests in full adjudication of constitutional

2

claims outweigh the interest in finality.

3

The question in Teague was whether the

4

Federal court could decide that for the States, and the

5

answer is no.

6

themselves.

7

But the States can decide that for

On Justice Souter's point about what -- or

8

somebody's point about what the source of authority was,

9

Mr. Diamond said it was basic norms of constitutional

10

adjudication, and that is the phrase used in Griffith.

11

That phrase is a minimum.

The basic norms

12

of constitutional adjudication require the following:

13

They require application of new rules to pending cases,

14

even though the conduct had already -- had already

15

happened.
