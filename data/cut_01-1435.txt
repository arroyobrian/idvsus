ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN W. SEYMOUR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8

10
11

MR. SEYMOUR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

The four doctors who are shareholder-directors


12

of the petitioner are not employees under the ADA, the


13

Americans With Disabilities Act, because, like partners,


14

they own and manage their own clinic.


15

QUESTION:

What -- what is the common law rule


16

on respondeat superior for an ordinary corporation vis a


17

vis a director?

18

an employee of the corporation?


19

MR. SEYMOUR:

20

Is a director of an ordinary corporation


In an ordinary corporation, the


common law rule is that the employee is like a servant. 


21

QUESTION:

Well, if -- if that's so --


22

QUESTION:

Well, what is your answer?


23

QUESTION:

I didn't hear you.


24

QUESTION:

I couldn't hear the response.


25

MR. SEYMOUR:

I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

Your answer was yes, was -- he is an


employee?


3

MR. SEYMOUR:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.


Okay.

Well, then Darden says common


5

law, common law says directors are employees, and these


6

are directors, end of case.

7
8
9
10

MR. SEYMOUR:

Why not?


Because Darden doesn't apply here. 


Darden was --

QUESTION:

Well, you didn't even cite Darden, I


don't think.


11

MR. SEYMOUR:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SEYMOUR:

14

QUESTION:

I believe I did.


Did you?

Yes.


I would think Darden would be the


15

first place we'd look.


16

MR. SEYMOUR:

Well, the difference between this


17

case and Darden is significant.

18

which the Court was required to determine whether an


19

individual was an independent contractor --

MR. SEYMOUR:

MR. SEYMOUR:

Darden was a case in

Yes.

That's not a choice here.


No, but the decision has to be made


on whether these people are employees.

1

MR. SEYMOUR:

2

QUESTION:

That's right.


And Darden says, well, we're going to


3

look to the common law, so what makes you think we'd do


4

something else in this situation?


5

MR. SEYMOUR:

Because there are frankly not much


6

common law that gives us guidance on how to decide whether


7

a director-shareholder in a professional corporation is an


8

employee or not.


9

The -- in Darden, it cited factors that are


10

really quite good at determining whether an individual is


11

an independent contractor or an employee.

12

don't work very well here, because they're not designed to


13

address the issues that we're looking at.


14

Those factors


That is, for example, one of the factors that


15

the common law looks to to determine whether a -- an


16

individual is an independent contractor is whether the


17

individual provides their own tools of the trade.

18

that's not the kind of factor that's going to work very


19

well in this kind of case.

20

that a Darden-like analysis is very appropriate, but we


21

think that it's better to use factors such as suggested by


22

the Government in their brief, that is, the EEOC guidance,


23

because those kinds of factors suggested in the EEOC


24

guidance go the heart of the difference between


25

shareholder-directors and employees.


Well,


Therefore, we're suggesting

1

The factors in Darden do not, so therefore the


2

Darden factors are like trying to pound a round peg into a


3

square hole.

4

clumsy.


We shouldn't do that, because it becomes


5

QUESTION:

It may be clumsy --


6

QUESTION:

But this was a case where it was very


7

important to the shareholders in this corporation that


8

they be labeled employees for ERISA purposes.

9

be -- if they weren't employees, they weren't going to be


10

able to get themselves covered under the retirement plan


11

as the law then was, so in -- in the ERISA context you


12

would be saying, of course they're employees.

13

they qualified under ERISA.

14

for that reason.


15

MR. SEYMOUR:

It had to


That's how


We set this thing up solely


Yes, Your Honor, except that I


16

think that the -- the tax purposes were more under the


17

general tax laws, not under ERISA, because they could


18

establish an ERISA plan and deduct the expenses.


19
20

QUESTION:

But didn't they -- in order to be


covered, didn't they have to be employees?


21

MR. SEYMOUR:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SEYMOUR:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.


Yes.

And -- and just --


And they wouldn't -- on your theory,


they're not -- so they are employees for that purpose?

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SEYMOUR:

Well, they're treated as employees


2

for that purpose, but they should not be treated as


3

employees for purposes of the ADA.


4

For example, if we turn the coin over and look


5

at the other side, and the Court is required to examine


6

whether someone who is labeled a partner is, in reality,


7

a -- an employee.

8

economic realities of that situation, that the partner is


9

really an employee, that doesn't mean that the


If the Court finds that, looking at the


10

now-employer should issue W-2's, or that they should have


11

been withholding.

12

have the same purposes as the ADA.


13

Those are tax issues, and they don't


QUESTION:

But the -- am I wrong in thinking


14

that the -- the whole thing was set up the way it was,


15

instead of as a partnership, for the reason that these


16

people needed to be characterized as employees for


17

retirement plan purposes?


18

MR. SEYMOUR:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.


And are they not also employees for


20

Worker's Compensation purposes?


21

MR. SEYMOUR:

22
23

Under Oregon law, they can opt out


of Worker's Compensation.

QUESTION:

But they'd have to opt out.

24

start out by being in.


25

MR. SEYMOUR:

Yes.

7

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

They


1

QUESTION:
get salaries?


MR. SEYMOUR:

3
4

They start out as being -- do they


They get salaries plus a bonus,


which is the division of their profits.

QUESTION:

5

But they get salaries.

There's


6

nothing inconsistent with being, say, the president of the


7

company and principal shareholder and being both an owner


8

and an employee.

MR. SEYMOUR:

9

That's true.

There's nothing


10

inconsistent about that, and our concern with this case


11

is, the court didn't go past the fact that the clinic was


12

organized as a professional corporation, and when the --

QUESTION:

13

Why should it, because I'm still


14

stuck with the language of Darden, which reads as a


15

general rule, when Congress has used the term, employee,


16

without defining it, we have concluded that Congress


17

intended to describe the conventional master-servant


18

relationship as understood by common law agency doctrine,


19

and it says, that rule stood as an independent authority


20

for the copyright decision.

21

here.


22
23

So, too, should it stand


Now, is your view, it should not stand here in

this case --


24

MR. SEYMOUR:

25

QUESTION:

That's our view.


-- as sufficient?

1

MR. SEYMOUR:

2

QUESTION:

That's our view.


All right, so you're asking us to


3

depart from Darden and to make an exception from the


4

Darden rule for the -- this particular act.


5

MR. SEYMOUR:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SEYMOUR:

8
9

For this --


Is that right?

For this particular circumstance,


that's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Well, when you say circumstance,


10

there's a word in an act, so you're saying that the word,


11

employee, in this title of the ADA does not bear the


12

common law definition?


13

MR. SEYMOUR:

14
15

Well, I think the common law


definition is one thing to look at.
QUESTION:

That is the --


No, no, I'm asking -- they said in


16

Darden that's the end of it, and you say -- I want to be


17

just clear about it.

18

Common law is not the end of it.


19

MR. SEYMOUR:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SEYMOUR:

22

QUESTION:

Okay.

23

QUESTION:

Would -- would you say that the EEOC


You say, it is not the end of it. 


Yes, that's what we're saying.


All right, and so --

Common law is not the end of it.

Now I understand.

2

might themselves be part of what we call the common law?

I -- I take it part of your position is based on


3

the proposition that the common law, I suppose of agency,


4

up through the 1950s just didn't have much on this subject


5

at all, when we're talking about the difference between


6

partners and professional and -- and employees of a


7

professional corporation.

8

writing on that subject.


9

MR. SEYMOUR:

There just wasn't a corpus of


No, there isn't much in the common


10

law, because a professional corporation is not a product


11

of the common law, nor is a limited liability partnership,


12

nor a limited liability company, and all three of those


13

organizations are virtually functionally identical once


14

they're up and running.

15

QUESTION:

They have the same --


Well, and as -- as courts begin to


16

write about these things in the area of subchapter S


17

status, tax status and so forth, there is an emerging


18

decisional law, at least, that's -- that's evolving, I


19

take it, and you might say that has some common law


20

attributes.

21

usually define it.


22

It might not be common law as we -- as we


MR. SEYMOUR:

Attributes, yes, but not that


23

focus on this particular question, and that is whether a


24

shareholder-director in a professional corporation should


25

be considered an employee for purposes of defining who --

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Who -- Darden also says, a couple of


2

pages after the quote that Justice Breyer -- since the


3

common law test contains no shorthand formula or magic


4

phrase that can be applied to find the answer, all of the


5

incidents of the relationship must be assessed and weighed


6

with no one factor being decisive, which suggests a more


7

fluid test, certainly, than the other language.

MR. SEYMOUR:

8
9

And a more fluid test would be


certainly more flexible, because --

QUESTION:

10

But that's exactly my point.

That's


11

why I started out asking you whether you concede that a


12

director of a corporation is an employee under the common


13

law, because if you concede that, you're saying that the


14

common law fluid test ends up with the director being an


15

employee, and I take it that it's well-established a


16

director is an employee.


17

MR. SEYMOUR:

18

your question to be --

QUESTION:

19

Well, that's -- I -- I understood


No, my question was to try to get the


20

framework.

Either you're saying the common law, you win,


21

or you're saying, common law, I lose, but I win anyway


22

because it's not the common law, so if you want to take


23

the tack, common law test, I still win, explain it to me. 


24

How is a director ordinarily an employee, but this one


25

isn't?

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SEYMOUR:

Well, under an ordinary


2

corporation, I think your -- your question would be yes,


3

but under a professional corporation, it's different.


4

It's much more like a partnership, because if we


5

look at the emergence of these new entities like limited


6

liability partnerships, limited liability corporations,


7

and professional corporations, they're all emerging for


8

professional businesses like this clinic from sole


9

proprietorships or general partnerships, and the only --


10

there's really no difference, functionally, when we look


11

at those different entities.


12

QUESTION:

13
14

Oh, but isn't there a huge


difference, that they've got limited liability?

If you have -- the corporation is liable if you


15

have, you're incorporated?

16

case, too?


17

MR. SEYMOUR:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Isn't that the true with your


No, the --


Whereas in partnership, the


individuals are liable?

MR. SEYMOUR:

In the partnership, individuals


21

are liable, but in a professional corporation, in a


22

limited liability partnership, in a limited liability


23

company, the -- for professionals, those limited


24

liabilities are all the same, and they're not as good as a


25

general corporation, or an ordinary corporation.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In other words, the doctors in this clinic, in a


2

PC, have liability for their own acts, and limited


3

vicarious liability for the acts of the other doctors. 


4

That's not true inside an ordinary corporation.

5

true inside a limited liability partnership and a limited


6

liability company.


7

QUESTION:

It is


Am I wrong in thinking that the --


8

that the individual liability is not across the board, but


9

it's only for malpractice-type claims?


10
11

MR. SEYMOUR:

malpractice-type claims, and I think --


12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SEYMOUR:

14
15
16
17

That's right, it's for


So --

-- that's pretty much true not


just in --

QUESTION:

But other claims against the clinic,


it -- they -- they would have limited liability?

MR. SEYMOUR:

Yes, they do, and that's true for


18

all three of those emerging types of entities,


19

professional corporations, limited liability partnerships,


20

and limited liability companies.


21

QUESTION:

Well, maybe there isn't -- there


22

isn't any settled law, is there, that a limited liability


23

partnership would not be treated the same way that this


24

entity is -- is treated?


25

MR. SEYMOUR:

Well, for example, as a partner in

13

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a partnership, limited liability partnership, I have


2

exactly the same limits on my liability as the doctors in


3

this clinic, and I am not an employee, I'm a partner, and


4

the only difference between my status and the status of


5

these doctors is the form of the business, and that's


6

really just a label.

QUESTION:

7
8

Well, you say you're not an employee,


but isn't that the question we have to decide?

MR. SEYMOUR:

9

Well, every court that's addressed


10

the issue of whether partners are employees, including


11

this Court --

QUESTION:

12

Well, you wouldn't suggest that every


13

partner -- no partner is ever an employee.

14

suggesting that, are you?

15

that's got 250 partners, you're going to say none of them


16

are -- are employees?

MR. SEYMOUR:

17

You're not


Say you've got a law firm


I'm sure there are some who would


18

say that, but I think that what the courts need to do is


19

look at the individual, not just at a label, and look


20

beyond the label to find out, as the EEOC standards --

QUESTION:

21
22

here.

Well, we don't have a partnership


We have a professional corporation --


23

MR. SEYMOUR:

24

25

MR. SEYMOUR:

Yes.


-- do we not?

That's correct.

QUESTION:

That's what we're talking about. 


We're not talking about partnership.

MR. SEYMOUR:

5

should be treated alike for purposes of the EEOC.

me, for purposes of --

MR. SEYMOUR:

QUESTION:

Excuse


But then we're away from --

Pardon me?


I thought you had a very good case in


10

your brief, and then I read Darden, and I realized the


11

reason I was thinking it, I was out of date and thinking


12

that Hearst was still good law.

13

opinion on employee.

14

all right, but I can't square that with what the Court


15

said.

16

because I haven't really heard you explain why it is that


17

the common law test won't pick up your clients.


18

That's Frankfurter's


I thought it was a great opinion,


That was my initial question, and I'm still there,


MR. SEYMOUR:

And I'm -- if I may, the -- the


19

problem with Darden is, it's examining a different


20

relationship than we have in this case.


21

In the Darden case, the issue was whether an


22

individual was an independent contractor, and we deal with


23

those issues all the time.

24

want to be an independent contractor, or make my employees


25

independent contractors, and we have to go through the

books and say, no, we can't let you do that because of


2

Darden, or whatever.

We don't see those kinds of circumstances in the


3
4
5

law.

There's no common law --

QUESTION:

Well, maybe the price that has to be


6

paid for professionals to set up a professional


7

corporation is to be subject to the ADA, and the anti-


8

discrimination law of title VII, and so forth, because


9

these people are going to be counted.

10

makes a difference.


11

MR. SEYMOUR:

12

QUESTION:

13

subject to these provisions?


14
15

In this case, it


Well --


Is that all bad, that they have to be


MR. SEYMOUR:

The reason that it's bad -- yes,


it is all bad.


16

QUESTION:

Why?


17

MR. SEYMOUR:

And the reason is that we should


18

treat similarly situated businesses the same, and there


19

are a -- a class of partner-like or proprietor-like


20

individuals, and there is a class of employee-like


21

individuals, and just because -- let's say it starts out


22

as a general partnership.

23

limited liability partnership, or a professional


24

corporation, or a limited liability company, that


25

shouldn't change who belongs in which class, and if we


Just because they shift into a


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

look beyond the label of professional corporation, then we


2

can see what the relationships are and therefore settle


3

that issue.

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for

rebuttal.

Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN


9

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


10

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


11

MR. GORNSTEIN:

12

may it please the Court:


13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it --


Under the EEOC's guidance, the question whether


14

shareholder-directors are employees depends on whether


15

they operate independently and manage the business or,


16

instead, are subject to the organization's control.

17

standard aligns the test for determining the employment


18

status of shareholder-directors with the test that courts


19

have long used in deciding whether partners are employees.


20

QUESTION:

That


Well, do you say that the EEOC has


21

adopted standards that differ from the common law, and has


22

by regulation or otherwise determined that we should apply


23

its test to this question?


24
25

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I guess largely, yes.

The EEOC


started with the common, common law right to control test

1

that is used to distinguish between independent


2

contractors and employees and adapted it to make a


3

distinction between those who were the proprietors of the


4

business and that business' employees, and it did so in a


5

way to align its standards for looking at the question of


6

shareholder-director with the same standards that have


7

been used by all the courts in deciding whether partners


8

or -- are employees


9

QUESTION:

And do you agree with the


10

petitioner's attorney that if you look to the common law


11

test, these people would be employees?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

12
13

If you look to the Restatement


as the measure of the common law --


14

QUESTION:

Yes.


15

MR. GORNSTEIN:

-- then generally speaking, a --


16

a director who didn't employ service -- perform services


17

would not have been an employee, but a director who


18

performed services would be.

Now, the only hesitation I would have is to say


19
20

that the -- that at the time of the Restatement there


21

wasn't -- there weren't professional corporations that


22

mixed and matched features of partnership and


23

corporations, so there's not as clear an answer on that.

QUESTION:

24
25

Do we owe deference to the EEOC


standard?

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The -- the Court should give


2

weight to the -- the EEOC's test because it reflects its


3

accumulated and longstanding experience in administering


4

the act, but we're not asking for Chevron deference here.


5

QUESTION:

6

get such deference?

7

back in the Gilbert case?


I mean, didn't -- wasn't that way


MR. GORNSTEIN:

8
9

Didn't the Court say the EEOC doesn't


It -- it did say that, that


it -- it doesn't get Chevron deference.

Now, there is an


10

exception now.

11

regulations, and this Court has held that those


12

regulations are entitled to Chevron deference, but this is


13

guidance that applies across the board to all the


14

nondiscrimination laws, and what the Court has said in


15

that context is that the EEOC's analysis gets weight, in


16

light of the fact that it has accumulated experience under


17

the law.


18
19
20
21
22

Under the ADA, the EEOC can issue


QUESTION:

But it would be kind of a Skidmore


deference.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It would be a Skidmore


deference, that's correct.
QUESTION:

Now, what --


I hate to be a bore on this, but will


23

you please write the two sentences for me where I have to


24

say either that, we apply the common law test, and in this


25

instance, the common law test comes out in your favor, or

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

we have to say, we don't apply the common law test because


2

the EE -- this statute is different.

3

paths, both of which could lead to your victory or your


4

defeat, do you think we should take?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

5
6
7
8
9
10
11

Which of those two


Neither of those two, Justice


Breyer.

QUESTION:

Neither, all right.

Then write that


section of the opinion.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I -- let me get to Darden,


because I think that's the focus of your questions.

As we read Darden, there is language that is


12

certainly broad enough in it to say that any time you use


13

the word, employee, you mean common law employee, but I


14

think that those, what -- you have to understand Darden in


15

the context of the -- the issue it was resolving in that


16

case, and there it was trying to draw a distinction,


17

whether the term employee embraces independent


18

contractors, and in that setting, Congress had twice


19

amended statutes to make clear that the term, employee,


20

did not mean independent contractor after this Court has


21

said that it could, and in that context, it makes perfect


22

sense to start out with a very strong presumption that


23

when Congress uses the term, employee, it does not mean


24

independent contractor.


25

But that's not the situation we have here, and

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in other cases where the Court has looked at statutes that


2

use common law terms, like Title VII does with respect to


3

the term, agent, it has felt a lot more freedom to adjust


4

that common law term to the purposes of the statute, and I


5

would point you to the Faragher case and the Kolstadt case


6

as two examples of that, and that's what the EEOC has done


7

here.


8
9

It has adapted that common law principle in

light of the fact that we have an established tradition in


10

the courts, well-established, of looking at the question


11

of partnership in a functional way, does this person


12

actually operate as a proprietor of the business, or is


13

this a partner in name only, and it makes perfect sense


14

for the EEOC to apply that same kind of functional


15

analysis in deciding whether shareholder-directors are


16

employees, because for purposes of deciding who should get


17

the protection of the act, and that's what we're talking


18

about primarily here, there is no practical difference


19

between shareholder-directors who run a business and


20

partners who run a business, and so it makes sense to --


21

to use the same test.


22

Applying the same test also makes sense in light


23

of the purposes of the small business exemption, because


24

the purpose of that exemption is to spare small businesses


25

the very substantial burdens of complying with the

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

nondiscrimination laws, and those burdens are experienced


2

in exactly the same way regardless of whether those who


3

choose to organize a small business do so through a


4

partnership form or a corporate form, and the -- the


5

analysis that the tests should be the same across the


6

board also makes --


7

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about the


8

application of your test?

9

the case, as I understand it --


10

MR. GORNSTEIN:

11

QUESTION:

You -- you urge us to remand


Yes, we do.


-- to answer the question whether


12

these individuals operate independently and manage and


13

control the business on the one hand, or are subject to


14

the organization's control on the other, and I ask you, is


15

it not possible that the same individual could meet both


16

halves of that test?


17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

18

QUESTION:

No.


Some of his duties, he'd be manager,


19

and some others he'd have to respond to what the group


20

told him to do?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

21
22

true, but what the EEOC's guidance --

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Well, it -- it's possible that's


What do you do if you find such a


case?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

You make --

QUESTION:

With respect to surgery, he takes


2

orders from the directors.

3

patients, he's on -- on his own.


4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

With respect to advising


What -- what we have here under


5

the EEOC's guidance is, ultimately you make an overall


6

judgment that's either-or, based on all the considerations


7

in the guidance, and they are at page 9 of our brief, so


8

that, just as in the partnership context, you look at all


9

of these factors, and just as you would in an independent


10

contractor status kind of situation, you look at all the


11

relevant factors, and then you make an overall judgment


12

about, essentially does this person function as a


13

proprietor of the business, or is he functioning as an


14

employee of the business overall.


15

QUESTION:

Why isn't it simpler just to say,


16

well, they picked a corporate form with their eyes open


17

because it was important for them to be labeled employees,


18

at least for retirement purposes, so they have to take the


19

bitter with the sweet.

20

they could have their retirement plans, and then it's just


21

much simpler to say, that's the form that they chose, and


22

the law for many -- in many contexts does follow what --


23

the form parties choose for their arrangement.

24

shouldn't that be the answer?


25

They got that qualification so


MR. GORNSTEIN:

Why


The -- the approach that the

23

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

EEOC has taken is to -- is a functional approach that


2

tries to treat all people alike, and to look to the real


3

functional relationship between the individual and the


4

employee, and the fact that somebody may have chosen to do


5

something for tax consequences, or chose to do something


6

for purposes of limiting individual liability, really


7

doesn't have anything to do with whether he is the sort of


8

person who should receive protection under the


9

nondiscrimination laws, and this is ultimately what we are


10

determining here, are these shareholder-directors people


11

who are employees and therefore receive protection under


12

the nondiscrimination laws, because it's only those people


13

who are the --


14

QUESTION:

Well, I thought we were looking to


15

see if some other, lower employee was covered, not these


16

directors, and that turns on whether you count them as


17

employees --


18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GORNSTEIN:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

That's --


-- or not.

That's correct.


We're not looking to see if they


themselves are covered under the ADA in this case.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But in order to answer the


24

question you have in front of you, which is, is this a


25

small business and does this employee get protection, you

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

first have to answer the question of, are these


2

shareholder-directors employees who get protection under


3

the law, so that is the inevitable product of having to


4

decide the small business exemption, is that you have to


5

decide, these are people who get protection under the


6

laws, and it -- it's just not the case that the policies


7

that underlie decisions about incorporation having to do


8

with tax consequences and individual liability have


9

anything to do with whether these are the kind of people


10

who should receive protection under the nondiscrimination


11

laws.


12

QUESTION:

Well, I just thought Congress was


13

more concerned with not making really small businesses


14

covered by these acts, that we weren't focused on whether


15

these professional shareholders should be covered, but


16

whether this was the kind of small business that shouldn't


17

be covered at all.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

18
19

Well -- I'm sorry, Justice


O'Connor.


20

QUESTION:

Is that right?


21

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I -- what Congress did in the


22

small business exemption is to link the exemption to the


23

number of people who receive protection under the laws,


24

and that makes sense, because it means that at most, when


25

the small business exemption applies, at most, 14

individuals will be excluded who otherwise would have had

protection.

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Gornstein.


4

Mr. Crispin, we'll hear from you.


5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG A. CRISPIN


6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. CRISPIN:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

The position of the clinic and the Government in


9
10

this case essentially is to look to ignore the form and


11

structure of the corporate business, yet just 2 years ago,


12

in Cedric Kushner versus King, this Court held that a sole


13

shareholder was separate and distinct from the corporate


14

structure itself, and that's the -- the essence of the


15

question.


16

QUESTION:

17

there, Mr. Crispin?

18

What kind of a legal issue was it

What act were we construing?


MR. CRISPIN:

That was a RICO question, and the


19

question was whether or not the two parts of the -- the


20

RICO enterprise on the one hand and the -- the other


21

aspect of the RICO question existed with both the


22

individual sole shareholder and director of the


23

corporation as being separate and distinct from the


24

corporation itself, and in that case the Court said, you


25

cannot collapse the two.

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The defense position was, they are, in fact, the


2

same identity, and this Court said no, that's not true. 


3

What -- the corporate structure is something separate and


4

distinct, which is recognized by this Court, has been


5

recognized for years and years and years, and that that is


6

something that cannot and should not be ignored.


7

QUESTION:

Well, the -- the reason we said it


8

was that we couldn't find any basis in the statutory


9

history or the text that -- that gave us a clue that


10

Congress, in effect, wanted to ignore something which is


11

such hornbook law.


12

The argument on the other side, I think, is that


13

there is a reason to think Congress would want to look


14

at -- at nontraditional concepts here.

15

that the common law definition of employee does not


16

axiomatically apply because it's not addressing the issue


17

that Congress was addressing in that -- in this statute. 


18

The issue that Congress was addressing in this statute, as


19

I understand the argument, in fact taking the -- the very


20

words that Mr. Gornstein used a moment ago, was the issue


21

of protecting people who can be hurt by discrimination. 


22

It was a protection issue.


23

The argument is


So that I think what he's saying, and -- and


24

what the petitioner's counsel are saying is, the one thing


25

that we do know about employees is that they were people

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

who were intended to be protected by this statute.

If


2

that is true, it is not probable that they were trying to


3

include as employees, the protected category, people who


4

don't need protection because they are in ultimate control


5

of the business, the ones who, if there's going to be


6

discrimination, are going to be doing the discriminating,


7

so it's probable that the people who have that ultimate


8

control would intend it to be within the employee


9

category.

10

address.


That's an issue that the common law didn't


11

How do you respond to that argument?


12

MR. CRISPIN:

Justice Souter, the individuals


13

that are subject to discrimination in this particular case


14

are not only the lower-level employees as this case


15

presents.

16

of those could come down with a disability and have the


17

remaining three shareholders refuse to accommodate or


18

otherwise violate the ADA with respect to that one


19

individual, so the -- the individual --


We have four shareholder-directors, and any one


QUESTION:

20

So you're saying, even on the premise


21

of their argument, it does not exclude any one of the


22

four.


23

MR. CRISPIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct.


I suppose if one of the four had a


51 percent, a truly indefeasibly controlling interest,

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you'd concede that, but short of that, which apparently is


2

not the case here, you say, even if I take their premises,


3

they lose.

MR. CRISPIN:

4

That's right, Your Honor, I --


5

although I -- let me comment that I'm not sure I would


6

concede the 51 percent, all -- I would concede it for your


7

hypothetical.


8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CRISPIN:

10

Yes, right.

But our position is that the


employing enterprise is the determining factor.

QUESTION:

11

How -- how does the EEOC treat an


12

ordinary corporation that, let's say, has 12 regular


13

employees and then three directors, the cousin, the


14

father, the son, or whatever, of the owner, so there -- so


15

it's as -- if you count the three -- and it's a perfectly


16

ordinary corporation.

17

Do they count those three directors, or not, as employees?

MR. CRISPIN:

18

There's nothing special about it. 


As I read their position, I -- I


19

believe that they, under the new guidance, would count


20

those directors under their balancing test.

21

apply the -- this multiple-factor balancing test, look at


22

the degree of control, and decide on a case-by-case basis.

QUESTION:

23

They would


So remember, these three are just


24

cousins.

They're not -- I mean, they only show up once a


25

year, and they vote, and -- and that's it.

That's their


29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

connection.


2

MR. CRISPIN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CRISPIN:

5

Do they count them or not?

In that case, Your Honor, they


would not be counted.


6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CRISPIN:

8

Well, in that case, Your Honor --


They don't count?

They don't count, because they're


not performing services --

QUESTION:

9

All right.

Then -- and those are


10

people who the common law really would consider to be


11

employees, at least while they're there for that hour a


12

year, is that right?

MR. CRISPIN:

13

I'm not sure what the answer would


14

be.

15

who performs services for the corporation --


16

We know that -- that employee is considered a person


QUESTION:

Well, they're there once a year for


17

an hour, and during that time they spill some water,


18

somebody slips -- I mean, a corporation, I guess, would be


19

liable, or -- or not?


20

MR. CRISPIN:

21

performing services --


22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CRISPIN:

25

On their acts, if they are


Yes.

-- for the corporation for


compensation they would at -- for that hour --

QUESTION:

Yes, for that hour.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. CRISPIN:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. CRISPIN:

-- be considered employees.


Right.

Now, of course, under the ADA


4

we're looking at numbers of employees over 20 weeks within


5

a calendar year.


6

QUESTION:

Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.


7

MR. CRISPIN:

But again, the idea, as this Court


8

recognized in Walters versus Metro Educational, was that


9

the determinations under the employment discrimination


10

statutes should be subject to ready and easy


11

determination.

12

should be avoided, but yet the Government's test and the


13

clinic's test, which has adopted the Government's test,


14

would have this Court look at the facts in each individual


15

case every time --


Complex and expensive factual inquiries


QUESTION:

16

Well, don't we have to give some


17

weight to the EEOC view?

18

completely?

MR. CRISPIN:

19
20

Do you just want to ignore it


No, Your Honor.

The Skidmore


deference is appropriate, Justice O'Connor.

QUESTION:

21

Why?

Why, because I would think then


22

you lose.

I mean, here -- if I'm very frank about it,


23

there are two competing things here, and the one thing,


24

give weight to the agency, let them define these terms,


25

particularly at the margin, but that's Hearst, and -- and

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the other is, no, no, it doesn't matter what they say, pay


2

no attention whatsoever to what they say.

3

to do is follow the common law definition.

What they have

That's Darden.


So if Darden applies, I take it you win, but if


4
5

Darden doesn't apply, it seems to be much harder for you


6

to win, because then the agency should get deference under


7

Skidmore, at least, in applying the term, and the agency


8

here has a different definition than the one that helps


9

you.

So that's where I am, and I'm quite uncertain


10
11

about it.

MR. CRISPIN:

12

Your Honor, two -- two responses


13

to your question.

Under Darden, it -- it does -- the


14

Court has decided that the common law applies, and we


15

would say that's appropriate.

16

Darden dealt with the independent contractor versus


17

employee test.

18

but the key concept is that the common law applies is


19

appropriate.


The precise test under


That is not absolutely translatable here,


20

The second aspect of your question, Your Honor,


21

was on the deference entitled to the EEOC opinion, and as


22

I understand Skidmore deference, it's only that deference


23

which is appropriate under the circumstances of their


24

test.

25

leads to inconsistent results, and it fails to further


In this case, the EEOC's test is not workable.

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It


1

the -- the interests that are looked at under the statute,


2

and I can turn to those points.


3

QUESTION:

Doesn't it, perhaps better than the,


4

just straight common law, of course, deal with the coming


5

of -- of age, so to speak, of the professional


6

corporation, which really didn't -- didn't amount to much,


7

if -- if it even existed 20 or 25 years ago?


8
9

MR. CRISPIN:
it, but it need not.

Mr. Chief Justice, it may address


It need not treat a corporation,


10

whether it's a professional corporation or a general


11

corporation, differently --


12

QUESTION:

No, it need not, but it has chosen to


13

do so, and the -- the question, I guess, before us is,


14

under Skidmore deference, is that a reasonable decision?


15

MR. CRISPIN:

It's not a reasonable decision in


16

looking at the professional corporation as the EEOC's test


17

would apply to it, and -- and the reasons are that, as --


18

as the EEOC and the clinic has suggested, an important


19

issue is one of consistency, yet applying their test does


20

not lead to consistent results.


21

One can imagine the -- the circumstance of a


22

professional corporation with one shareholder-director and


23

14 employees. Under their test, that individual


24

corporation would not be covered.

25

It has fewer than 15.


Take the situation, though, where there are 14,
