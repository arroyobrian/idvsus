ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL NEAL K. KATYAL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

GENERAL KATYAL:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

Background checks are a standard way of

12

doing business.

13

all civil service employees since 1953 and for

14

contractors since 2005.

16

privacy precluded asking the questions it asked, that

17

was wrong for two basic reasons.

18

The Government has required them for

If the Ninth Circuit in this

vitiates no constitutional privacy interest.

dozens of years.

limit to what questions the Government can ask -

2

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, the -

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

GENERAL KATYAL:

-- an applicant?

The -- the limits are -- in

5

this case, are the ones on SF-85 and Form 42.

6

think that that's a fairly -

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

GENERAL KATYAL:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And we do

What does that mean?

Well, those two Could you ask somebody,

10

what's your genetic make-up, because we don't want

11

people with a gene that's predisposed to cancer,

12

whatever other -- could you ask that?

13
14

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I think that the

Court doesn't need to confront that fairly -

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We do, because I have to

16

start with the question of what are the limits on the

17

Government, if any?

18

as an employer, there are absolutely none, or are you

19

taking the position that there are some, and what would

20

they be?

21

Are you taking the position that,

GENERAL KATYAL:

Our position is, in a case

22

such as this, where there are collections on the

23

Government's dissemination of the information -

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what you are saying

is, there's no limit?
4

Alderson Reporting Company

GENERAL KATYAL:

I -- I think that this

2

Court in Whalen -- and there is no decision thus far

3

that has recognized any constitutional limit on the

4

Government's collection of information, so long as there

5

are accompanying safeguards on the disseminations and -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Katyal, why are

7

we getting into this?

8

me, is a challenge -- your challenge to a preliminary

9

injunction which was quite narrow.

10

question at issue.

11
12

Because this case, it seems to

There was only one

There is no cross-appeal, is there?

GENERAL KATYAL:

There -- there is no

cross-appeal.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So we have Form 85.

The

14

only thing that's in contention there is the question

15

about treatment or counseling.

16

are we talking about the universe of what questions

17

might be asked?

18

Nothing else.

So why

And on the other form, I take it, it's just

19

the so-called open-ended questions, not everything on

20

the form.

21

GENERAL KATYAL:

I quite agree, Justice

22

Ginsburg.

That's what I was trying to say to Justice

23

Sotomayor; that is, I think that this case doesn't force

24

the Court to answer questions it has never really

25

answered, which are the outer limits of what the
5

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

Government can do in terms of the collection of

2

information.

3

Here you have a narrow decision by the Ninth

4

Circuit, one whose reasoning, I think, could radiate

5

very broadly and undermine Government -- the

6

Government's background checks generally.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, what do you think has

8

been -- there hasn't been a formal injunction entered, a

9

preliminary -- a preliminary injunction, has there?

10
11

GENERAL KATYAL:

It's only -- it's at the

preliminary injunction stage.

12

But our -- our point is that the reasoning

13

that the Ninth Circuit used, if adopted -- if adopted to

14

create a permanent injunction, could preclude the

15

Government from asking all sorts of questions in

16

background -- in background checks, not just the ones it

17

isolated here, but more general ones, because the Ninth

18

Circuit decision is essentially a how-to manual on how

19

to question, various individual questions, and

20

micromanage them and inject Federal courts into -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the -- the

22

entire Form 85 was approved, and there's no question you

23

could ask about, have you used drugs within the last

24

year?

25

counseling that's -- that is at issue, right?

It's only the question about treatment and

6

Alderson Reporting Company

GENERAL KATYAL:

That's -- that's all that

2

the Ninth Circuit ruled on at the preliminary injunction

3

stage.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does that -- does

5

that ruling stop you from asking that question right now

6

throughout the Ninth Circuit?

7
8

GENERAL KATYAL:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
yes.

11
12

The drug

treatment question?

9
10

Which question?

No, no, no.

The -

Yes, the counseling and treatment question.
GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, there's a -- the

mandate has been stayed -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

GENERAL KATYAL: -- so we haven't been able

15
16

Right.

to CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if we sustained

17

-- if we sustain the preliminary injunction, the

18

Government can't ask that question throughout the -

19

the -- the reach of the Ninth Circuit?

20

GENERAL KATYAL:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's exactly correct.
And -- and if we did so,

22

it would be because there is an underlying privacy right

23

that's somewhat ill-defined or undefined?

24
25

GENERAL KATYAL:

Exactly, Justice Kennedy.

And if this Court were to embrace that reasoning -- and
7

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

this is my answer to you, Justice Ginsburg, as well -

2

then it doesn't just reach drug treatment.

3

imagine other litigants doing it for other forms of

4

questions, whatever they may be.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I could

But the -- the circuit

6

precedent, as far as the other questions on Form 85 -

7

the circuit said that's okay.

8

those questions.

9

GENERAL KATYAL:

It's permissible to ask

Thus far, that's correct.

10

But I could imagine other litigants coming in, and maybe

11

not just with respect to these questions but questions

12

on SF-85P or Form 86, any number of other things.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Katyal, what is the

14

well-defined, the well-defined, constitutional right to

15

institutional -- to informational privacy that the

16

Government is -- is willing to acknowledge?

17

apparently don't -- don't challenge the existence of

18

such a constitutional right.

19

GENERAL KATYAL:

You -- you

Justice Scalia, our

20

position is that the Court doesn't need to answer that

21

question.

22

Court assumed the existence of some sort of

23

constitutional right and then said:

24

violated here?

25

It's just like Whalen, because in Whalen this

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that right

It's a strange way to
8


Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

proceed.

We normally don't do that, see?

If there were

2

a constitutional right, would it cover this?

3

GENERAL KATYAL:

I agree -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do we do that in cases?

5

I

don't think so.

6

GENERAL KATYAL:

I agree that in many other

7

contexts, it might not be appropriate, but here I think

8

there are some good reasons why.

9

special reticence to the rule broadly in the range of

This Court has had

10

privacy, and I think the reason is privacy is something

11

that is in flux in ways that other things aren't, both

12

in terms of our social understandings, technology, and

13

legislation itself.

14
15

And for that reason, I think this Court has
spoken narrowly whenever it's dealt with -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would justify not

17

defining it broadly or narrowly.

18

not reaching the question of whether there is any such

19

constitutional right at all.

20

GENERAL KATYAL:

It wouldn't justify

Justice Scalia, that's what

21

this Court has done throughout its history.

22

was a unanimous decision, and Nixon, on that particular

23

question, I don't think there was a disagreement about.

24

So -

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And Whalen

How can the Court determine
9


Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

that the right is not violated here without having some

2

idea about either the existence or the contours of the

3

right?

4

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I think it would just

5

be like in Whalen itself.

6

there might be some right to informational privacy, but

7

so long as there are safeguards on the disclosure, the

8

Government's dissemination of the information, that

9

means that there is no -

10

So in Whalen, the Court said

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it -- is it your argument

11

that the Government can collect whatever information it

12

wants from private individuals so long as the

13

information is not publicly disseminated?

14

GENERAL KATYAL:

No, that's not our

15

position.

16

collect information so long as it is not disseminated in

17

the employment context.

18

is one that has that added fact to it, that the

19

Government here is asking -

20

Our position here is that the Government can

And this case, unlike Whalen,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, does it -- does it

21

help us in finding what this residual background right

22

is and asking you:

23

it?

Why is it that you can't disclose

24

GENERAL KATYAL:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm sorry?
Why can't you disseminate

10

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

the information?

2

GENERAL KATYAL:

3

by statute, the privacy of -

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

GENERAL KATYAL:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Surely -- we are restricted

Let's assume no statute.
If you assume In other words, this is

7

just testing whether there is some background

8

constitutional right and how to define it, if we have to

9

use that as a beginning premise.

10

GENERAL KATYAL:

Absolutely.

If we took out

11

all of the safeguards that are at issue here, then the

12

case wouldn't be like Whalen or Nixon, in which you had

13

those -- in which you had safeguards in the

14

dissemination.

15

question, which we think you shouldn't confront in this

16

case, for the reasons I said to Justice Scalia.

17

And then you would have to confront the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what would be your

18

position if the -- all this information were disclosed?

19

Or that there was an attempt to disclose all the

20

information, and they asked you for your advice -

21

GENERAL KATYAL:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY: -- on a constitutional

23
24
25

Right.

basis?
GENERAL KATYAL:

Right.

I mean, our

position is that the Court really shouldn't, for all of
11

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

the reasons I said, get into it, but if the Court had to

2

get into it and ask is there some constitutional right

3

that would be violated, Justice Kennedy, by your

4

hypothetical, our answer would be no.

5

But we do think the way that this has been

6

traditionally been handled is legislation.

7

for political processes -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Safeguards

So when you say your

position would be no, you mean that there is no right of

10

any kind under -- I know you don't want us to reach it,

11

but you would say there is no right of any kind for a

12

citizen to tell the Government that that's none of your

13

business.

14

anything of a citizen, so long as you don't disclose it.

15

The Government will decide that it can ask

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, in the

16

employment/proprietor context.

17

had to confront that question, it would apply the matrix

18

that Justice Scalia has talked about, the Glucksberg

19

matrix, of whether a right -- the right is firmly rooted

20

in the traditions of the people, and -- and ask:

21

Government's collection -

22

Okay?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the Court

Is the

Do you think it's

23

firmly rooted in our traditions that there is some right

24

to tell the Government that's none of your business?

25

GENERAL KATYAL:

I think there is some

12

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

right.

2

unique employment/proprietor context is one the Court

3

hasn't confronted, and our strong -- our strong position

4

here is the Court shouldn't confront it.

5

The question about whether it employs in the

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the test -- what is

6

the test for determining what sort of questions can be

7

asked in the employment context?

8
9

Is there any limit?

Suppose the -- suppose the Government says,
well, we want to know all about your diet; we want to

10

know whether you smoke cigarettes; we want to know

11

everything you read; we want to know what your hobbies

12

are, what forms of entertainment you enjoy, sexual

13

practices, every aspect of your private life, just

14

because that gives us a better picture of who you are as

15

an employee.

16

Is that okay?

GENERAL KATYAL:

Sure.

No, there are

17

limits, and I should have said this earlier.

18

Government's collection of information or the disclosure

19

of the information burdens some other fundamental

20

constitutional right, that is certainly one limit.

21

If the

So if the Government were collecting

22

information, Justice Alito, on sexual practices of its

23

employees, it may burden the exercise of other rights.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
putting those aside.

Yes, but that's

I mean, what about some of the
13


Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

hypotheticals that Justice Alito posed?

2

GENERAL KATYAL:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

Your diet?

So That's certainly

4

relevant in the employment context, right?

5

going to have to pay for your health care, worry you

6

might miss things, miss days of work.

7

So I guess the point is:

They're

Do you think the

8

Government's right to inquire in the employment context

9

is exactly as broad as a private employer's right?

10

GENERAL KATYAL:

I do think that if the

11

private employer -- the private employers are a good

12

template.

13

private employers do, as Justice Scalia said in O'Connor

14

v. Ortega, that's a good suggestion that what it's doing

15

is reasonable.

16

If the Government is simply mirroring what

Now, to the extent, Justice Alito, that they

17

are gradating far beyond what private employers do, in

18

terms of asking about eating habits and the like, I do

19

think that that may pose -- that there may be some

20

limits.

21

It simply needs to look at the Ninth Circuit's decision,

22

which recognize a broad, free-standing right against

23

informational collection of its employees to make sure

24

and -- and realize that that is a serious problem for

25

the way the Government does business.

The Court doesn't need to confront that here.

14

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We do have a legislature,

2

don't we, that can place some limits on what the

3

Government asks employees or anybody else?

4

GENERAL KATYAL:

Absolutely.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's the same legislature

6

that prohibited the Government from disclosing a lot of

7

information, isn't it?

8

GENERAL KATYAL:

That's precisely correct.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it's possible that

10

that's the protection that the Framers envisioned,

11

rather than having courts ride herd on -- on Government

12

inquiries.

13

GENERAL KATYAL:

It's certainly possible,

14

Justice Scalia.

15

are enormously interesting, but the -

16
17

I think that all of these hypotheticals

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Were these two forms

approved by Congress?

18

GENERAL KATYAL:

The forms themselves were

19

not approved by Congress, but the Privacy Act, which is

20

the main restriction -

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's a restriction on

22

disclosure, but the same Congress can change that,

23

correct?

24
25

GENERAL KATYAL:

That's absolutely correct.

The Privacy Act has been around since 1975, and the
15

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

Government has collected -- you know, it's been used

2

millions of times, SF-85.

3

in the last 4 years, and we have not seen the types of

4

disclosure or complaints that I think animate the worry

5

that my friends on the other side are saying.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's been used 553,000 times

What is the

7

reason -- I've had trouble putting my finger on it -

8

that you need the information about counseling?

9

You already have the information, have you

10

used drugs in the past year?

11

thought the question about counseling was for the good

12

of the employee -- oh, you are taking steps to -- or was

13

it to allow you to show, well, it must be serious,

14

because you need counseling.

15
16

GENERAL KATYAL:

I couldn't tell if you

It is for the good of the

employee, so it's a -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, now that's -

18

whenever the Government comes and says this is for your

19

own good, you have to be -

20

(Laughter.)

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

-- you have to be a

little suspicious.

23

I mean, if it's -- the employee gets to

24

expand upon his or her answer.

25

it.

They say, tell us about

And they can say, don't worry, I'm in counseling or
16

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review

treatment.

2

for their good.

3

It's another thing to say, I'm in AA.

4

And even then, that doesn't sound like it's
It's one thing to say, I had a drink.

GENERAL KATYAL:

Mr. Chief Justice, the way

5

the question is framed is, first, they are asked, have

6

you used illegal drugs in the last year?

7

and then, if the answer is yes, provide details and then

8

indicate any treatment or counseling received.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And then -

Now, I had a

10

question about the way it's worded.

11

it says, if you've used it in the last year, detail your

12

involvement with drugs and any counseling you received.

13

You're supposed -

Do you understand the counseling question to

14

be limited to the past year, or to reach back as far

15

as -

16
17
18

GENERAL KATYAL:

I -- I think that the

question itself is vague.
Now, the way that our -- that the Office of

19

Personnel Management will process such a form is it will

20

process anything so long as there is information about

21

just drug use on the question -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But do you think

23

it's required?

I mean, you do sign at the end, this is

24

true to the best -- do you think it's required to

25

disclose counseling and treatment you received more than
17

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

a year back?

2

GENERAL KATYAL:

No.

This is unlike, for

3

example, SF-86, which does ask for treatment and

4

counseling back up to, I think, a 7-year period.

5

So I think this is a much more narrow

6

inquiry, and I think the reason for that inquiry is to

7

help the employee.

8

investigation -

9

The Government -- the background

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The answer to that is

10

obvious.

11

the good of the employee, make it voluntary.

12

It was raised by the other side.

GENERAL KATYAL:

If it's for

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

13

think that that's the type -- that that's the type of

14

inquiry that this Court rejected in Whalen.

15

Whalen, the whole debate in the court, in the district

16

court below, was, well, if you want to stop doctor

17

prescription mills people from providing too many

18

narcotics, you don't need the names and ages of the

19

patients.

20

redact that.

21

Because in

We could change the triplicate forms and

But what this Court said on the second page

22

of its opinion was it called that Lochnerian, that

23

Federal courts shouldn't be policing forms and excising

24

or suggesting random different -- you know, a few

25

different words here or there.
18

Alderson Reporting Company


Official - Subject to Final Review
1

And here, experts put this form together to

2

try and get at, basically, are you using drugs and are

3

you using treatment which might ameliorate the fact that

4

you had used illegal drugs in the last year.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I had thought before

6

the argument that one of the purposes for asking about

7

treatment was to identify employees who may have

8

undergone treatment on numerous occasions and dropped

9

out of programs and been unsuccessful, so as to identify

10

chronic drug abusers.

11

you've just said, that this only reaches back 1 year,

12

that is not a purpose of this -- this question.

13

But I guess in light of what

GENERAL KATYAL:

That is correct, and in

14

preparation for this, we did survey all of the NASA

15

different centers to ask, has treatment ever been used

16

in any sort of way to hurt an employee?

17

that came back was, no, it has not been used.

18

only been used to help.

It is to retain someone who did

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how do you

21

know -- how do you know that?

I mean, you ask a lot of

22

questions on these forms, and they say, well, we're not

23

going to hire you.

24

because you put in, you know, in treatment for -- for

25

drug abuse?

How can you go back and say it was

19

Alderson Reporting Company

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, the process by which

2

this takes place is the form is filled out.

3

ultimately sent to an adjudicator if there is negative

4

information, and that -- and that information is then

5

discussed with the candidate for employment or the

6

employee to see if they have an explanation.

7

times that this has happened, that someone has been

8

denied -- and I think the number is 128 times over the

9

-- over the last 5 years -- none have been denied for a

10

positive answer to drug treatment.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is

And of the

Over the last 5

GENERAL KATYAL:

Where did it come from?
Well, it's -- it's been

10

hard to actually pin down where it came from.

I think

11

it is derived from earlier Office of Personnel

12

Management materials at a time when it listed out what

13

various crimes were.

reasoning is capable of being ameliorated easily.

5

I don't think that the Ninth Circuit's

So we talked before about how the drug

6

treatment was just a narrow part of the Ninth Circuit

7

decision, but this Form 42 -- the invalidation of Form

8

42, goes to the heart of what the Government does all

9

the time and what all employers do.

They ask open-ended

10

questions to figure out whether someone is trustworthy

and reliable.

spots in an individual application are.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you were not saying

2

that, then what's the narrower ruling?

3

what I thought I heard at the beginning of our colloquy

4

today.

5

GENERAL KATYAL:

Because that's

Justice Sotomayor, the

6

narrow rule is what we said in our petition and what we

7

said on the very last page of our reply brief and all

8

throughout, which is, this Court should simply say what

9

it said in Whalen, which is assuming that there is some

10

sort of right to informational privacy, the -- the use

11

of a background check with accompanying safeguards to

12

collect information doesn't violate any constitutional

13

right to privacy.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, why wouldn't that

15

violate it if the question involved a fundamental right?

16

If you were asking the question that Justice Alito

17

asked, which is, what's your sexual practices in the

18

bedroom, if there are security checks against you

19

disclosing it, you're saying even that would be okay?

20

GENERAL KATYAL:

I could imagine a

21

circumstance far afield from this one in which the

22

Government's just mere collection of information about

23

sexual practices might burden the exercise of those

24

rights.

25

and I don't think the Court should get into it.

I'm saying it's not at all present here, but -

24

Alderson Reporting Company

But that's a really different question than

2

the one here, which is:

3

right to constitutional privacy that is unburdened by

4

the fact that there are protections against the

5

disclosure of information?

6

imposes strong protections against the disclosure of

7

information.

8

interest in the part of the employees.

9

Is there some free-standing

Here, the Privacy Act

And so what's left is a very residual

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Don't -- this is a bit

10

unsatisfying because you start by saying to us, as long

11

as there are some nondisclosure protections, then

12

virtually any question, whether it impinges a

13

fundamental right or not, would be okay, because

14

there's -- I don't even know what the Government's

15

interest is in asking every question it wants to.

16
17
18

There has to be a need for a set of
questions, doesn't there?
GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I could imagine an

19

as-applied challenge to, for example, you know, the

20

hypothetical on sexual practices or whatever.

21

I do think, as Justice Scalia said, the real

22

check on that is the political process check.

23

is that the Government doesn't ask those kinds of

24

questions, and -- and to the extent it ever did, the

25

Court could confront that in an as-applied challenge.

MR. STORMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue as now characterized is really how

24

far may a Government go, may this Government go, to

intrude into the private lives of its citizens, both in

2

classified issues, national security issues, or

3

positions of public trust?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Stormer, what provision

5

of the Constitution are you relying -- I looked at your

6

table of authorities in your brief, and you have cases

7

listed, you have statutes listed; there is not a single

8

citation anywhere in your brief to a provision of the

9

Constitution.

10
11

What provision of the Constitution are you
relying on?

12

MR. STORMER:

It would mostly fall -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think it's a very nice

14

thing that the Government shouldn't ask intrusive

15

questions.

16

Government should pay a living wage to its employees,

17

but I don't feel authorized to go around saying how much

18

the Government should pay each of its employees because

19

there is nothing in the Constitution about that, and the

20

question is left to Congress.

I also think it's a nice thing that the

21

What do you rely on in the Constitution that

22

enables me to decide how much intrusiveness is too much,

23

rather than leaving that to Congress?

24
25

MR. STORMER:

It would flow from the ordered

concept of liberty component of the Fifth Amendment, as
28

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Fifth Amendment?

ordered concept of liberty.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

what I thought.

here.

13

Due process of law.

All right.

That -- that's

You're talking substantive due process

MR. STORMER:

Well, the Whalen case, the

14

Nixon case, and to some extent, the Reporters Committee

15

case refer to this concept of privacy.

17

privacy as being the right to control information about

18

oneself.

And they are, in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, I like that, but I

21

just don't see it anywhere in the Constitution.

22

all I'm taking about.

23

MR. STORMER:

That's

Well, I -- there -- those

24

cases, in fact, do not refer to a term called

25

"informational privacy."

Those terms have grown from
29

the various cases that have flowed from the

2

determinations in Whalen and Nixon and, to some extent,

So that right is subject

5

to what level of scrutiny?

scrutiny?

8
9

Is it always strict

And how do you square Whalen and Nixon's

MR. STORMER:

The -- the standard would

be -- I think the appropriate standard was applied by

10

the Ninth Circuit, which is a legitimate state interest

11

narrowly tailored to meet that need.

12

In this case, there is some -- like the Von

13

Raab case, which is not cited in our brief but which is

14

a Fourth Amendment case, the -- this Court used a

15

compelling state interest standard for a Fourth

16

Amendment invasion.

17

remanded on the issue of whether or not the positions

18

involved classified or sensitive materials.

And in that case, the Court

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what is your view of

20

what the liberty -- you're saying that the words in the

violated are the words, "No person shall be" -- I

23

guess -- "deprived of life, liberty, or property,

2

MR. STORMER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

It might not,

have to be justified.

MR. STORMER:

10

Any intrusion into private

lives would have to have some -

8

Is that -- is that your theory?

JUSTICE BREYER:

It says "liberty."

The

liberty, you said, was liberty to control information
about yourself.

11

MR. STORMER:

That was the -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I want to know how that

13

works.

Every time anyone in the Government asks a

14

question about you personally -- of course, it wouldn't

15

be unconstitutional -- but every time it would have to

16

be a justified thing; is that -- is that your theory?

17

I'm just asking.

MR. STORMER:

information about yourself?

defined the constitutional right to information about

yourself.

MR. STORMER:

Correct.
Is that all information

about yourself, including your date of birth, your

10

Social Security number, your -- where you live, where

11

you've gone to school, who your friends, who your

12

references are?

13

that, it would include all of that.

14

MR. STORMER:

Because as broadly as you've defined

It -- the -- the nature of

15

what is included can be intruded upon based upon a

16

governmental need.

17

knowing Social Security numbers, driver's license,

18

census information, that type of information, then -

19

then there's not an issue.

20

So if there's a rational basis for

MR. STORMER:

The -- the

3

difference between this case and, ultimately, what was

4

allowed in both Whalen and Nixon -- excuse me,

particularly in Whalen -- is that there was some

6

overarching societal need to have this information.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose the person who

8

works at the -- at the gift shop or the snack bar -- I

9

think that's what you mentioned -- has a big sign on his

10

front lawn that says, "I hope the space shuttle blows

11

up."

Is that information the Government has a
legitimate reason to get?

14

MR. STORMER:

I would agree that -- that in

15

that instance, "I hope the space shuttle blows up,"

16

would certainly implicate some First Amendment issues,

17

but the Government should know that information.

than by asking an open-ended question.

Only if you need to know the

7

answers.

And for the snack bar worker or the GS

8

clerk-typist, for those types of people who have no

9

access to sensitive information, do not -- it can -- the

10

definition here is that these are no- or low-risk -

11

they are low-risk employees, which is defined as, if

12

they misuse their position, they will have little or no

13

impact on the agency mission.

14

So we know that these questions are being

15

asked of people who, if they completely misused their

16

position, there will be no impact -

disqualifying, would that be unconstitutional?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

I think I ask that question

because that begs the question of can you ask anything

10

you want regardless of why?

11

GENERAL KATYAL:

I think that political

12

process ensures that the Government generally has to ask

13

-- has answer that question writ large, but in order for

14

the Ninth Circuit's reasoning to apply, it would permit

15

any individual person here or there to ask the

16

question -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't see how that's so

18

because, at least if you're in the Ninth Circuit, you

19

know that the Ninth Circuit has blessed all the

20

questions on that form but one.

21

GENERAL KATYAL:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that's only So, I mean, you could

23

raise the question, but you'd be out of court in a

24

minute.

25

GENERAL KATYAL:

Justice Ginsburg, I think

56

that's only because the challenge -- or the Petitioners

2

here only challenge certain questions.

3

imagine other petitioners challenging other questions.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, I could

I thought they did in the

5

lower court but abandoned it here, challenge the

6

question about the drug use.

7

GENERAL KATYAL:

The drug use piece, but I

8

could imagine all sorts of inquires about other aspects

9

of the form.

And, indeed, the rationale, the language

10

that I just read to you is a road map for anyone to be

11

able to come in and say, well, this -- this question

12

isn't -- isn't necessary for me because I got a

13

background clearance before, I'm rehired, or whatever.

14

And it would be a huge practical burden in the same way

15

as recognizing the cause of action in Engquist was a

16

practical burden.

17

should do here is what it did in Whalen, which is

18

recognize governments collect information all the time,

19

collect -

20
21
22

Instead, we think what the Court

JUSTICE ALITO:

How much of the information

that's at issue here can be released and to whom?
GENERAL KATYAL:

The information that can be

23

collected that's released here is governed by the

24

Privacy Act.

25

brief lists out precisely to whom they could be released

And so there are -- the appendix to our

57

to, and that has been around since 1975.

2

virtually no complaints about the Government disclosing

3

this type of background information on the SF-85.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We've seen

Is that also within the

5

Government itself?

6

Government can't disclose, but how about checks -- I

7

mean, we have a vast government -- checks about

8

circulating the information within the Government?

9

I know the Privacy Act says the

GENERAL KATYAL:

If it is for a -- if it is

10

to further the Government purpose for which the

11

information is collected, it can be distributed to other

12

folks in the Government.

13

that, so -- and they're specified in the Privacy Act,

14

and they're quite extensive.

15

Court is concerned that there is something that isn't

16

robust enough in the Privacy Act, we suggest that would

17

-- that could wait for an as-applied challenge down the

18

road when information is disclosed.

19

There are restrictions on

And to the extent the

And we don't think it will, but if, heaven

20

forbid, that happens, that's the basis for an as-applied

21

challenge down the road.

22

you to do is invalidate questions and forms that the

23

Government asks all of its employees and now just wants

24

to ask contractors.

25

But here what they're asking

Thank you.
