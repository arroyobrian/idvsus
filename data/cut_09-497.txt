CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

argument first this morning in Case 09-497,

Rent-A-Center West v. Jackson.

Mr. Friedman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. FRIEDMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The agreement between Antonio Jackson and

12

Rent-A-Center should be enforced as written.

13

no statutory impediment to the enforcement of the clear

14

and unmistakable agreement that gives the arbitrator

15

exclusive authority to decide Jackson's challenge to

16

enforceability, nor is there any language in the Federal

17

Arbitration Act that would prohibit the court from

18

making the determination -- prohibit the arbitrator from

19

making the determination of Jackson's challenge to

20

unconscionability.

21

There is

Through frequent holdings of this Court

22

going back 50 years to the Steelworkers trilogy, this

23

Court has plainly recognized that parties may delegate

24

issues as to scope and validity to the arbitrator in the

25

first instance.

The district court and --

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?

3

MR. FRIEDMAN:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

But not to the

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Not the question of

which parties have agreed to arbitrate?

6

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Which parties can be

7

potentially scope issues and which parties potentially

8

as well.

9

And through the holdings of First Options, Howsam, and

In this case, the issue is enforceability.

10

Bazzle, going back to previous decisions, this Court has

11

held that parties through clear and unmistakable

12

delegation can give that to the arbitrator in the first

13

instance.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

But if -- if fraud in the

15

inducement, I take it, is considered -- even if you have

16

a very broad arbitration clause, as we do here, fraud in

17

the inducement is considered a question for the court,

18

not the arbitrator; is that right?

19
20

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

unconscionability be treated differently?

23

MR. FRIEDMAN:

So why should

Justice Ginsburg, fraud in

24

the inducement, pursuant to Prima Paint, goes to the

25

making of the agreement, and under section 4, the court

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

retains decisions over the making of the agreement.

2

Unconscionability is a post-formation attack.

3

not go to the very limited inquiry that is anticipated

4

under section 4, of the making --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It does

Why is it post-formation?

6

Arguably, the -- one of the parties has such a strong

7

hand that it forces the other party just to decide.

8

It's almost like -- duress would certainly be for the

9

court, would it not, if it's a formation issue like

10
11

Justice Ginsburg indicated?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

In some instances,

12

Justice Kennedy, duress could be; for example, a gun to

13

somebody's head.

14

not go to the same issues of making.

15

Nevada law and this State's laws --

16

But procedural unconscionability does

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And, in fact, under

Well, I'm not sure what

17

procedural unconscionability, but this is -- as Justice

18

Ginsburg indicates, it's not clear to me why this isn't

19

a formation issue.

20

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Formation is a very basic

21

existential analysis.

22

the parties sign the agreement and indicate the desire

23

to be bound by the agreement?

24
25

It goes to mutual assent.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did

Though -I guess you could argue

that on its face the agreement is so one-sided, so

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unconscionable, that one of the parties must have been

2

coerced into signing it.

3

argument, can't -- couldn't you?

4
5

MR. FRIEDMAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Has -- has that argument

been made here?

8
9

Justice Scalia, you could

make that argument --

6
7

I guess you could make that

MR. FRIEDMAN:

There was an argument made

that it was one-sided, but it was the same type of
argument that pertains -JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

Was the argument made that

12

because it was so unconscionable, the employee must have

13

been coerced into making it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

14
15

18
19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't think it -- it had

been made.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Getting back to

Justice Ginsburg's question about making -JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm a little puzzled.

21

What was the argument that was made?

22

unconscionable, if not for that reason?

23

That

argument was not --

16
17

No, Justice Scalia.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Why was it

Justice Stevens, the argument

24

was that there was unequal bargaining power because

25

Mr. Jackson was the -- a putative employee and Rent-A-Center

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was the employer.

2

the provisions in the agreement, one pertaining to

3

discovery, one pertaining to an alleged fee-splitting

4

provision in the agreement.

5

the terms that Justice Scalia just referred to.

6

He also complained about a couple of

He did not complain as to

With respect to making, it is a very limited

7

inquiry, and section 4 is the provision in the Federal

8

Arbitration Act that gives a court the power to

9

enforce the arbitration agreement.

Once the court is

10

satisfied that the making is not an issue and the making

11

is a very basic issue, the court, pursuant to the plain

12

language of section 4, must submit the dispute to

13

arbitration.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. FRIEDMAN:

You have --

Now, in some instances, the

16

courts will make decisions as to attacks such as

17

unconscionability.

But in this sense --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

Counsel, is your problem

19

with unconscionability being -- as described by the Chief

20

Justice or Justice Scalia, being forced to or coerced

21

into signing something -- that's okay for the courts, but

22

this type of argument that goes to the unfairness of the

23

process, that's for the arbitrator; is that your

24

position?

25

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's -- that's right, Justice

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Sotomayor.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why -- isn't that an

3

unwieldy rule?

4

defined as remissible unconscionability as a legal

5

matter, as opposed to trying to parse out what

6

unconscionability means otherwise?

7

Isn't your quarrel with what the court

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

8

unconscionability and fairness attacks go to

9

post-formation issues that -- that are --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We just gave you one

11

that didn't:

12

agreement in an unconscionable way.

13

If someone was forced into signing the

MR. FRIEDMAN:

But, Justice Sotomayor, if

14

for example it's fraud in the inducement, such as in

15

Prima Paint, that does go to the section 4.

16

to the making of the agreement because there would not

17

be mutual assent if somebody was forced to enter into

18

the agreement.

19

It does go

In contrast, unconscionability, and

20

certainly the allegations we've seen here against the

21

agreement, go to post-formation complaints, complaints

22

about the fairness of the agreement.

23

the actual, very limited making of the agreement.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They do not go to

But I suppose that

the substance of the agreement -- maybe this is just the

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

same question as Justice Scalia's.

2

substance of the agreement is evidence -- could be

3

evidence on the unconscionability at formation.

4

MR. FRIEDMAN:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

I suppose the

Well -And that is for the

court.

7

MR. FRIEDMAN:

If -- if there is something

8

in the agreement that would indicate that there was not

9

mutual assent, as in somebody put a gun to somebody's

10

head, somebody forced them to do it, that would be for

11

the court.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, the point is --

13

it's not that.

14

one-sided that you may assume from that that the

15

formation was not voluntary.

16

It would be the -- the provisions are so

MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

Attacks on the fairness and simply pointing to

18

provisions and saying, well, these are very unfair; it

19

must be an indication of it being forced -- no, that would

20

be for the arbitrator to decide, because it's simply an

21

attack on the fairness and there's speculation as to why

22

somebody entered.

23

And in this agreement --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't agree with that.

24

mean, if -- if the argument is made -- I gather it

25

wasn't made here, but if the argument is made that this

9
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agreement was not voluntary, and the evidence of that

2

involuntariness is how outrageously unfair it is -- now,

3

I'm not sure that that's enough evidence.

4

some other stuff as well to -- to persuade a court.

5

You may need

But if that is the argument, that the

6

one-sidedness is evidence that the agreement was not

7

voluntary, I don't see how that's for the arbitrator.

8
9

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Justice Scalia, under the

section 4 analysis, in the making there needs to be some

10

evidence that it was forced, the gun to the head

11

example.

12

agreement as evidence of that would not be enough.

13

is an attack on the language of the agreement after it's

14

been formed.

Simply pointing to the language in the
That

The section 4 analysis is very, very limited,

15
16

and it goes to these most basic elements.

17

language of the agreement, while certainly the party

18

opposing it will have the opportunity to make the

19

argument it's unconscionable, but that would be for the

20

arbitrator.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the

You don't think that could

22

be used along with other evidence?

23

saying is that it is not in and of itself enough, that

24

every unfair agreement is not a coerced agreement.

25

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think all you're

It certainly would not in and

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of itself be enough --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you could use it as

3

evidence if there's other evidence supporting that.

4

Couldn't you?

5

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Your Honor, you would have to

6

look at the objective manifestation of mutual assent.

7

For example, in this agreement --

8
9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:
yes or no.

I think you can answer that

Can you use that in addition to other

evidence to show that the agreement was not voluntary?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

11

Justice Scalia, I don't think

12

so.

I think you would have to look to what transpired

13

at the time the agreement was actually entered into and

14

was made.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

And that's no matter how

16

one-sided?

17

the employee shall pay all the costs of arbitration no

18

matter who wins and also at the end of the arbitration

19

shall pay a penalty if he fails to -- it seems to me you

20

could have a really one-sided -- that would not be

21

admissible on the issue?

22

I mean, suppose the agreement provided that

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Justice Stevens, if there is

23

an issue about arbitral access, as in there is a block

24

at the door, you cannot get a ticket to the show,

25

because of some impediment in getting to arbitration in

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the first place, under the Court's principles announced

2

in Randolph and in First Options, you must have access to

3

the arbitrator.

4

something prohibiting access to the arbitrator, that

5

would be a different story.

6
7

So in your example, if there is

Getting back to Justice Scalia's question
about the --

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the specific

9

examples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that

10

the employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration,

11

win or lose, that's the provision.

12

be enough to make the issue one for the court rather

13

than the arbitrator?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

14

Would that provision

Justice Ginsburg, if it's

15

simply a complaint about the fairness, it would not be.

16

If the parties --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is it?

We don't need

18

the "if."

19

the employee under any and all circumstances pays all

20

costs -- would that provision make this question of

21

unconscionability one for the court rather than the

22

arbitrator?

23

Tell me whether you think a provision saying

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It could, Justice Ginsburg.

24

It would not be a question of arbitrability if the party

25

opposing arbitration can meet the very heavy burden

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

established in Randolph to show that the fees would

2

be -- would prohibit them from actually getting to

3

arbitration.

4

here, with no evidence, that we think a term is unfair.

5

It would not be simply an attack as we saw

The party opposing arbitration would have to

6

meet their burden.

They would have to put evidence in.

7

And, for example, in Randolph the Court stated that in

8

certain instances Mrs. Randolph could have put evidence

9

in, and had she put evidence in, which she did not, much

10

as in this case, if she had met her burden to show that

11

she could not have access to arbitration -- in other

12

words, if arbitration is an illusory remedy -- that

13

could be for the court to decide, because, after all,

14

even in the First Options decision, the anticipation is

15

you have a clear and unmistakably delegation that the

16

arbitrator will make a decision, and implicit in that

17

that there is an arbitrator to make that decision.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, that's -- that's true.

19

The thing I was wondering in this case is there's a -- a

20

dispute that's about racial discrimination and so forth.

21

There's a clause, and the clause says this is

22

arbitrable, but that is being disputed because the

23

plaintiff in the case says that's an unconscionable

24

provision, so it doesn't really apply.

25

but now that dispute is referred to the arbitrator to

13
Alderson Reporting Company

And then you say

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just read the language.

2

that language, too, is unconscionable, and as long as

3

that language is unconscionable, then how is it clear

4

and unmistakable that they, he, agreed to do it, because

5

an unconscionable provision is not a provision?

6

But the plaintiff says that

So if we apply First Options -- I mean, it's

7

complicated because of the language; it's not

8

complicated once you think it out, and -- I hope.

9

just applying it very literally, it would seem to say

But

10

that you do not have clear and unmistakable evidence

11

that they agreed to submit this kind of dispute to

12

arbitration for the reason that what you point to is

13

itself according to them a product of unconscionability.

14

How do you -- how do you respond to that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

15

Justice Breyer, under section

16

4, which is the enforcement mechanism, the court is

17

limited to make decisions about the making.

18

making issue is not an issue -- and it has never been an

19

issue in this case; there has never been an allegation

20

the making has been affected -- the court at that

21

point should enforce the agreement pursuant to its

22

terms.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Once the

Well, making itself

24

could be, but I think that's a harder question,

25

whether a -- certainly if the person says you see my

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

signature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's,

2

who tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no

3

matter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator.

4

All right?

5

Now, we can argue about whether it is or is

6

not analogous to that when he claims it's

7

unconscionable.

8

analogous.

9

fraud in the inducement, and there are some arguments

10

There's a very good argument it is

There's a very good argument it is like

the other way.
But First Options I think cuts through that,

11
12

by saying whether that's true or not, unless it's clear

13

and unmistakable that they wanted this matter, the

14

matter of whether the arbitration clause itself is

15

unconscionable referred to the arbitrator, whether or

16

not they wanted that referred to the arbitrator has to

17

be clear and unmistakable.

18

because the lack -- the provision that says that is

19

itself a product of unconscionability.

20

my question.

21

isn't that the simplest, most direct, and four-sentence

22

ground for deciding this case?

23

And they are claiming no,

That's to repeat

But, having repeated the question, why

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Justice Breyer, Jackson, first

24

and foremost, did not ever complain that the arbitrability

25

provision, the clear and unmistakable delegation provision,

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is unconscionable.

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

whole arbitration clause is unconscionable?

4
5

He's not saying that this

MR. FRIEDMAN:

He's complaining that

generally it's unconscionable --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, all right.

So he's

7

-- he's complaining the whole clause is unconscionable,

8

and that's part of the clause.

9

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Justice Breyer, this is really

10

very similar to First Options, in which the party said:

11

I'm not party to the agreement; the scope does not

12

cover --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, and in First Options, we

14

said it wasn't clear and unmistakable.

15

MR. FRIEDMAN:

16
17
18
19

The Court said it was not,

but in First Options the Court set out the rule -JUSTICE BREYER:

And the rules were what I

just described.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The rule is -- in this case,

20

there is language that has never been contested, and that

21

language clearly and unmistakably says that the

22

arbitrator has exclusive authority.

23

never been attacked.

24
25

That language has

And as to the issue of unconscionability,
pursuant to section 4, which gives the court the

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority to send the arbitration to the arbitrator, the

2

court should do exactly that.

3

arbitrator once the making issue is satisfied, and then

4

the arbitrator can make that decision.

It should send it to the

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

that the arbitrator gets to decide questions of

7

unconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether

8

the arbitrator can do that?

9

MR. FRIEDMAN:

So your position is

In some instances, Justice

10

Roberts -- Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct.

11

must decide whether the agreement is made.

12

must also decide whether there was a clear and

13

unmistakable delegation.

14

cases that interpret it and the cases before it, the

15

court must make the initial determination of whether

16

there is a clear and unmistakable delegation.

17

The court

The court

So under First Options and the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do you understand --

18

and we can ask the Respondent.

19

Jackson's case, is he saying that part of the clause,

20

part of the arbitration clause, is unconscionable, that

21

the whole clause is unconscionable or that the whole

22

contract is unconscionable?

23

MR. FRIEDMAN:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

But, as you understand

He has made generalized -Because the complaint is a

bare-bones complaint, and I don't know if there's

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

anything in the pleadings that reflects what his answer

2

to that question would be.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

3

Justice Kennedy, he has

4

attacked certain provisions specifically of the

5

agreement.

6

He is arguing about the fees provision.

7

about certain terms excluding claims, that bilaterally

8

exclude claims.

9

provisions of the agreement specifically.

10

He is arguing about the discovery provision.
And he is arguing

So he has attacked about three

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But all of the

11

arbitration agreement, not the employment contract as a

12

whole.

13
14
15

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, it is a

stand-alone four-page arbitration agreement.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And --

So let's go back to that.

16

Maybe the other way is simpler.

17

if my defense to this contract, which you are trying to

18

enforce against me or which gives me a right to sue you,

19

look at the argument, you put up this four-page

20

document, and I say:

21

that is the signature of Joe Bananas.

22

for the court.

Look, that is not my signature;

23

MR. FRIEDMAN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

You say you agree that

We agree that's

We agree, Justice Breyer.
Okay.

Now, we agree it's

for the court if my defense is, what he did is he got me

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

drunk, told me a bunch of lies, and I signed it.

2

grant it's my signature, but look at how squiggly it is.

3

And my will was not a free one because I was under the

4

influence of alcohol and lies.

5

MR. FRIEDMAN:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

We agree -Okay.

Same.

Okay.

That's Prima Paint.

8
9

I

MR. FRIEDMAN:

-- because that's part of

the fraud issue.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay?

Now, he

11

says the reason that I did not sign this contract -- I

12

agree it's my signature; I agree it is not squiggly -- but

13

still my will was overborne.

14

It was overborne by those very situations that lead

15

courts to label contracts unconscionable.

16

don't enforce unconscionable contract is because the

17

person who was the victim had no free will.

18

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN E. SILVERBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SILVERBERG:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Petitioner would have the Court adopt a

19

rule whereby agreements to arbitrate are presumed

20

enforceable before their validity has been determined by

21

a court under section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act.

22

They would have people like Mr. Jackson waive their

23

right to go to court through the use of a clause

24

delegating this judicial function to the arbitrator.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you describe for

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

us what is unconscionable about this contract?

2

your claim of unconscionability?

3

arbitration per se; it's just certain of the provisions

4

here; if you change the provisions, I'm happy with

5

arbitration.

6

Is that your position?

7

MR. SILVERBERG:

What is

He says it's not

Yes, Your Honor, that --

8

that what is unconscionable about this is it's unusually

9

one-sided in that the issues that are most important to

10

Mr. Jackson, such as his racial discrimination case, he

11

is required to arbitrate, but those issues that might be

12

most important to the Petitioner, such as trade secrets

13

and unfair competition, they are not bound to arbitrate.

14

So -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

I would have thought

16

the issue would be -- it's odd to say, I think, that if

17

you have 10 provisions, some are unconscionable and

18

some are not.

19

unconscionability in the making of the whole contract.

20

In other words, it's the same question I asked your

21

friend:

22

there was no unconscionability in the making, then the

23

arbitrator decides.

25

anything.

The issue would be whether there is

1, 8, and 9.
MR. SILVERBERG:

If I understand Your

3

Honor's question, the -- the threshold determination

4

must first be made by the court under section 2 as to

5

whether there is unconscionability either of the entire

6

agreement or any of the provisions.

7

assuming that were found, that some provisions were in

8

fact unconscionable, it would be on State law to

9

determine whether or not the entire agreement gets

10
11

It would then,

thrown out -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, my point is that

12

once you get past that gateway question of whether the

13

formation of the contract was not unconscionable, then

14

claims that particular provisions were unconscionable

15

are by definition for the arbitrator to decide.

16

MR. SILVERBERG:

No, we would disagree with

17

that, and here's why, Your Honor, and I think this goes

18

to something that Justice Sotomayor asked, which is it

19

creates a very difficult rule to deal with.

20

Petitioners here, one, they have made a huge concession,

21

we believe, in their reply brief by saying that if there's

22

an illusory remedy, that that is a section of

23

unconscionability that the court can hear and must hear.

24

But all these other --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

Why is that -- why is

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that a big concession, because I thought, as the First

2

Circuit said, if argument is the -- the contract is

3

illusory, that goes to the court, but here the only

4

claim is unconscionability.

5

fairness.

6

That's a question of

It doesn't go to the court.
MR. SILVERBERG:

The -- the reason it's a

7

concession is because that's not their original position

8

and that's not the question that they presented to this

9

Court.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if they -- if they

11

made that concession, so what, under the First Circuit's

12

reading?

13

MR. SILVERBERG:

The First Circuit, Your

14

Honor, we believe did not interpret this correctly.

15

They have, we believe, carved out a section of

16

unconscionability law at the exclusion of all other

17

unconscionability law.

18

We know that States and Federal courts have

19

routinely applied State unconscionability law, and they

20

would have a rule whereby all this jurisprudence of the

21

States delineating unconscionability law would in

22

essence be preempted.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that -- is that right?

24

Is the arbitrator free to decide unconscionability in a

25

vacuum without taking into account State law at all?

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And doesn't he get reviewed afterwards by the State

2

court on the basis of a much more lenient standard

3

than -- than if the court decided it de novo.

4

he really disregard State law regarding

5

unconscionability?

6

MR. SILVERBERG:

But can

Well, the problem is, Your

7

Honor, and if I understand Your Honor's question

8

correctly, that determination must of course be made by

9

the court, because the arbitrator doesn't have any

10

authority to do anything until the requirements of

11

section 2 are met.

12

Honor's question.

13

And I hope I'm understanding Your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No -- I mean, you -- I

14

thought you were saying that if we allow this to go to

15

the arbitrator, the arbitrator can simply disregard the

16

question of unconscionability.

17

MR. SILVERBERG:

That -- in essence, yes.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's not my

19

understanding.

My understanding is that he's -- he is

20

obliged to take account of State law regarding

21

unconscionability, but it's going to be his call, as it

22

would be the district judge's call if this had gone to

23

court, whether in fact this is unconscionable.

24

Afterwards, there will be court review.

25

totally disregarded all State law regarding

30
Alderson Reporting Company

And if he has

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unconscionability, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a basis

2

to set aside the -- the arbitration?
MR. SILVERBERG:

3

Respectfully, I -- I

4

disagree with that, and here's why, Your Honor:

The

5

back-end review -- presumably it would be, I believe,

6

under section 10(a)(4) that he exceeded his authority.

7

And once the arbitrator is empanelled under the

8

Federal -- under section 2, once he is authorized to

9

make any decisions at all, including the issue that the

10

Petitioner would have him decide of unconscionability

11

and arbitrability, it would be impossible for anyone to

12

say he has exceeded his authority.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That doesn't mean -- does

14

that mean he can disregard -- let's assume the contract

15

is a contract to maim.

16

it's like -- it's a Shylock contract, okay?

17

to be able to exact a pound of flesh.

18

State laws which invalidate contracts to maim.

19

think that the arbitrator can ignore that, and say,

20

well, you know, I don't really think it's so bad; a

pound of flesh sounds reasonable to me?

Situation

It's an arbitration

23

MR. SILVERBERG:

Right.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

As to that one, we assume

25

that the parties intended the question of arbitrability

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to be arbitrated; we assume it.

Normally, that's the

2

rule.

3

That's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes

4

that's not the argument.

5

there are four different provisions in the arbitration

6

section, and we think one of them is void because it's,

7

say, unconscionable, but the others are okay.

8

one, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough

9

say I want that one to go to arbitration.

It's the scope of the arbitration agreement.

10

The argument could be:

Well,

Now, that

And the third one is that you have a

11

contract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on

12

four separate pieces of paper, and what you're saying

13

is, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe

14

unconscionability is the equivalent.

with you.

16

On that one I'm

I don't see how you can submit -- agree to

submit that to the arbitrator, because there's no

18

agreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid

19

one under State law.

20

But what are you arguing?

That this is that

21

case or this is the other case I just mentioned, that

22

middle case where you have 10 provisions and you're

23

saying that this one over here is unconscionable but

24

that one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid

25

arbitration agreement. I agree with that.

33
Alderson Reporting Company

It's just that

certain provisions of it are invalid because they're

4

would be the second one.

5

That -- Your Honor, it

That there are issues --

JUSTICE BREYER:

don't see how you get there, because if it's the second,

7

one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement

that's valid.

And if you concede that there is a valid

invalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if

it's clear enough?

Oh, you have to have an open door; this was --

3

this was not properly before the arbitrator.

4
5

MR. SILVERBERG:

I think if Your Honor is

asking --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because, you see, if

7

you say yes, that they can arbitrate this, then the

8

question is why can't they do it when the contract's

9

signed?

10

MR. SILVERBERG:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Again, Your Honor -Let's assume that the

12

answer to my question is yes, they can put that to an

13

arbitrator.

14

case if the agreement clearly comprehends submission of

15

this issue to the arbitrator?
MR. SILVERBERG:

16
17

it clearly does that.

20

Well, we don't concede that

We -- what our position is --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18
19

If that's so, how can you prevail in this

I'm -- I'm asking, assume

you do?
MR. SILVERBERG:

I don't think that gets us

21

around the requirements of section 2, Your Honor, that

22

says the court and the doors to the court must always

23

remain open for that.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

MR. SILVERBERG:

I thought your --

I hope I'm understanding your

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Silverberg, the

3

section 2 on which you place much emphasis just says

4

that agreements are enforceable save on such grounds as

5

exist in law or equity for revocation of a contract.

6

But the section 2 doesn't say any -- anything about who

7

decides that question.

8
9

MR. SILVERBERG:

That's true, Your Honor,

the -- but the logical reading of that statute would

10

indicate that these three elements -- a writing, in

11

interstate commerce, and not revocable at law and

12

equity -- would have to be met before the arbitrator has

13

any authority to do anything.

14

And as Your Honor mentioned in the -- in the

15

Doctor's Associates case, there are certain issues that

16

are certainly involved, and unconscionability is one of

17

those issues that can be presented to the court without

18

violating section 2, as well as fraud and duress, I

19

believe, were the other ones that the Court had -- had

20

delineated in that case.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I read your -- I promise

22

you I'll go back to First Options, which I thought was

23

of gem-like clarity --

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I am apparently the

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only one in the world --

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- the only one in the

world who thinks that.

6
7

That's because it was well

argued.

4
5

MR. SILVERBERG:

And I'll go back to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Didn't you write that opinion?

8

(Laughter.)

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

look at it.

I'll go back to that and

But the -- the --

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

You wrote that, didn't you?

Looking at your response to

their motion to arbitrate --

14

MR. SILVERBERG:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- it seemed to me you

16

said here that -- that because of your -- your position,

17

your client's position, that the whole thing is

18

unconscionable.

19

You didn't say that?

MR. SILVERBERG:

Well, we said that -- it

20

was certainly my position that the entire agreement was

21

unconscionable based on Nevada law --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

23

MR. SILVERBERG:

And that it was so

24

incredibly one-sided, and also the limited discovery

25

provisions, and also because, frankly, we are not

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

looking to treat this anything other than like we would

2

ordinary contract law that also strikes one-sided

3

provisions in -- for example, in Nevada, the Fick case,

4

which would strike down a one-sided prenuptial

5

agreement, or lease agreements that have one-sided

6

attorney fee provisions are routinely struck down as

7

one-sided.

8
9

So their position -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

case for arbitration?

But which is the stronger

Case one, you attack the

10

arbitration clause only, part of the arbitration

11

contract only, as being unconscionable.

12

attack the whole agreement as being unconscionable.

13

those both stand on the same footing, or is one a

14

stronger case for submission to the court than the

15

other?
MR. SILVERBERG:

16

Case two, you
Do

I think this Court has made

17

clear in the severability cases that challenges to the

18

contract as a whole would go to the arbitrator to

19

decide.

We have here, as Petitioner admits to -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

I find that somewhat

21

paradoxical, but I -- I agree that that -- that that's

22

the law.

23

MR. SILVERBERG:

So the stronger one would

24

be an -- as this case, which we believe is very

25

strong, an attack --

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So if you do go to the

2

State court, suppose the State court says:

3

really decide this question about the one clause unless

4

I determine the conscionability or the unconscionability

5

of the entire contract, and I now proceed to do that.

6

Do you have to wait and say:

7

I can't

Stop, you

can't do that?

8

MR. SILVERBERG:

I think that's what

9

sections 3 and 4 contemplate, is for -- and they have

10

been in existence since the passage of the Act -- for

11

parties to come in and make their case as to whether or

12

not the FAA would apply or not apply.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But suppose the State

14

court judge says that he has to look at the whole

15

contract.

have to go back to the arbitrator now?

17

19
20

Do you say:

Oh, I'm sorry to bother you; we

MR. SILVERBERG:

this case, but assuming it were -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. SILVERBERG:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

What's your -- no, it's a

hypothetical case.

21

23

That's not the situation in

I understand.
What would your position

be in the hypothetical case, representing your client?
MR. SILVERBERG:

Representing my client, who

is Mr. Jackson, I would want the court to look at the

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whole thing, but if I were in the Petitioner's shoes I

2

think I would have an argument that, based on this

3

Court's precedent --

4
5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what do you think the

judge should decide as between those two possibilities?

6

MR. SILVERBERG:

If it's an attack on the

7

contract as a whole, it should go to the arbitrator.

8

think that's clear from many of the Court's cases;

9

whereas, if the attack is to the arbitration clause

10

itself, that is something for the court to decide and

11

determine.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

Counsel, I think I heard

13

Justice Kennedy's question to be -- let's not confuse

14

the contract as a whole.

15

here.

There's only one contract

16

MR. SILVERBERG:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

I

Correct.
It's an agreement to

arbitrate.

19

MR. SILVERBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So an attack on the --

21

as I think Justice Breyer noted, you -- an argument that

22

it's one-sided goes to the entire arbitration agreement.

23

I don't want to arbitrate because that's not what I

24

chose to do freely.

25

Correct?

MR. SILVERBERG:

Correct.

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That, you say, is for

the court.

3

MR. SILVERBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The difference here is

5

that there are provisions within how the arbitration is

6

going to be held that, standing alone, you think are

7

unconscionable, even though the agreement to arbitrate

8

is not.

9

Am I correct in understanding your allegation?
MR. SILVERBERG:

No, Your Honor.

10

Respectfully, it's our position that both are present.

11

There are certain elements of the arbitration agreement

12

that are unconscionable and, under Nevada law, which

13

would render the entire arbitration agreement

14

unconscionable.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You see, that's what I'm

16

confused by, because when I first asked you this

17

question, you said:

18

the court struck the discovery provision and, I guess,

19

the fees provision.

20

I would be happy to arbitrate if

Which answer are you giving me?

MR. SILVERBERG:

I'm giving you the one I

21

just gave you, I think, Your Honor, which is we've got

22

both certain provisions that are unconscionable, that

23

under Nevada law render the entire agreement

24

unconscionable --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Let's assume --

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. SILVERBERG: -- and that's what the Court

1
2

is to rely on.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

Okay.

That -- now I

4

understand that part of your argument.

5

that that wasn't Nevada law, that Nevada law would say

6

severability works, and there is an agreement to arbitrate,

7

and all we have to or could do is strike the unfair provisions.

8

Let's assume that situation.

9

whether to strike the unfair provisions?
MR. SILVERBERG:

10
11

But let's assume

Who decides

That would be the court

under our position, Your Honor, and that -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

No, that can't be

13

right.

The -- how can you say there's no problem

14

agreeing to arbitrate, no imbalance in bargaining

15

authority whatever, but then say, oh, but these

16

procedures are unconscionable?
It seems to me that the procedures are

17
18

there, and the party, the employee, whatever, can look

19

at those.

20

you don't sign the agreement as a whole.

21

are -- in for a penny, in for a pound.

22

arbitrate, then it's at least for the arbitrator to

23

decide particular provisions, whether they're

24

unconscionable.

25

And if he says, well, that's unconscionable,

MR. SILVERBERG:

Well --

44
Alderson Reporting Company

But once you
If you agree to

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know you're

2

arguing in the alternative.

3

we get to pick out the provisions we don't like and say

4

those are unconscionable, but the agreement as a whole

5

is not -- that seems to me illogical.

6

MR. SILVERBERG:

But the one argument that

Your Honor, that is our

7

position.

I hope I am understanding your question.

8

this is a matter of State law as to which provisions

9

would render the entire agreement unconscionable.

10

think that body of unconscionability law is not so

11

varied that we would have unwieldy results.

12

State --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's a matter

-- it may be a matter of State law, but the open

15

question is who gets to decide it.
MR. SILVERBERG:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

matters of State law all the time.

19

MR. SILVERBERG:

And I

I think

14

16

But

Right, and our -Arbitrators decide

Certainly, they do.

21

22

have to be met.

24
25

But before they have that authority

And that is our position in this

That's -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's assume Nevada law

says you cannot -- you cannot fire somebody for coming

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in late to work any fewer than 10 times, all right?

2

And an individual is fired.

3

at least the company tries to take him to arbitration on

4

it.

5

of Nevada law.

He goes to arbitration, or

And he says, no, because I was fired in violation

6

Now, is it your position that that -- that

7

that case would have to go immediately to court and

8

could not submit to the arbitrator the issue of whether

9

indeed he was fired for coming less than 10 times, and

10

indeed whether if he was coming in less than 10 times,

11

that would be an invalid basis for a dismissal?
MR. SILVERBERG:

12

No, Your Honor, and here's

13

why:

I think Your Honor has described a situation

14

similar to -- I believe that was the Green Tree

15

situation, where there was an allegation that the entire

16

contract was illegal, the usurious contract.

17

was no question as to the making of the agreement to

18

arbitrate.

19

But there

So, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if there is

20

no dispute as to the arbitration agreement being subject

21

to a ground of revocation at law or at equity as

22

defined in section 2, then I would -- I would concede

23

that that was something that would go to the arbitrator,

24

Your Honor.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, your -- your position

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

seems to be that unconscionability is the same as

2

coercion in the making of the agreement.

3

know that that's true.

4

MR. SILVERBERG:

And I don't

Well, Your Honor,

5

respectfully, in Doctor's Associates, I think the Court

6

spoke very clearly that fraud, duress, and

7

unconscionability are there and are part of something

8

that can be raised under section 2.

9

Court's hold in Prima Paint --

And also the

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I don't care what we --

11

MR. SILVERBERG:

-- where fraud --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't care what we said in

13

dictum.

It doesn't seem to me that unconscionability is

14

the same as duress or the same as fraud --

15

MR. SILVERBERG:

To -- oh, I'm sorry.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that you can -- you can

17

be a stupid person who voluntarily signs an unconscionable

18

contract.

19

stupid, but you haven't been coerced.

20

distinction between unconscionability and coercion?

21

Now, the courts may protect you because you're

MR. SILVERBERG:

Is there no

Not under section 2, Your

22

Honor.

I think the -- the definition that the

23

Petitioner would have this Court adopt, that narrow view

24

of making -- again, something Justice Sotomayor

25

brought up -- would create a rule where certain

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unconscionability challenges went to the court --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why is that?

3

MR. SILVERBERG:

-- and other

4

unconscionability challenges didn't go to the court.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why is that?

I would say

6

all unconscionability challenges, if you have an agreement

7

that's as clear as this one, would go to the arbitrator.

8

Which ones would have to go to the court?

9

MR. SILVERBERG:

All of them should go to

10

the court, Your Honor, based on this Court's holding

11

both in Doctor's Associates and Prima Paint, in that

12

both fraud in the inducement, like in Prima Paint, and

13

14

got a formed contract that people can choose to opt out

with what the various State courts have been doing in

reliance on those holdings.

I'd like to know

48

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

about that argument.

I'd like to know what really

2

is the underlying, which I've never looked up.
What is the underlying rationale in contract

law of setting aside contracts as unconscionable?

5

do courts do it?

6

know that.

7

What's the theory?

MR. SILVERBERG:

Why

I'd like to

My understanding is that

8

it's so unfair that it couldn't really be said that a

9

party assented to -- to that.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think that's what -See, that's what I wonder,

11

that last part -- is it that the basic theory is we want to

12

protect a group of people by -- who voluntarily entered

13

into contracts by giving them the right to opt out, or is

14

is that we don't think that they really meant to do it?

It's the latter, Your

Okay.

question, or any other question, is, I would imagine,

agreement one was unconscionable.

21

into agreement two, and the parties in agreement two

22

agree to -- to arbitrate their unconscionability dispute

23

in agreement one, and there's nothing wrong with

agreement two, I would think that's then the question of

unconscionability is for the arbitrator.

why I asked the question.

But maybe you did.

MR. SILVERBERG:

That's

I -- I think that the safe

7

thing to do is to keep the door open to people,

8

especially in situations like this, where there is such

9

unequal bargaining power, where people are presented

elementary question?

Yes, Your Honor.

unconscionable, that it's unconscionable for some

clauses but not in its -- in its entirety?

MR. SILVERBERG:

I think in Nevada you would -- if we had maybe just one

3

unconscionable clause, that the court might sever and

4

send the rest to the -- and validate the rest of the

5

arbitration agreement.

number of clauses, depending on State law, would make

7

the entire agreement to arbitrate unconscionable.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does it make a

difference in response to Justice Stevens's hypothetical

10

that there is a provision saying the arbitrator will

11

decide the conscionability of all clauses?

12

arbitrator may decide that clauses 2 and 8 are

13

unconscionable, but if there's an agreement and it's

14

not unconscionable that the arbitrator will decide, then

the arbitrator decides all of them, right?

16

MR. SILVERBERG:

17

I understand your question.

If the agreement -- I think

Right.

-- there's no

21

unconscionability challenge to that, and there's no

22

other fraud in the inducement or any other thing that

23

the court has mentioned it would go to the broader view

24

of making the grounds for revocation, if those grounds

25

for revocation are not present, then I believe the

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I ask you just a

4

follow-up on Justice Breyer's hypothetical to you where

5

he had the first agreement and then the issue to the

6

second?

7

The door open on the second agreement or on the first

8

agreement?

9

You said you've got to leave the door open.

MR. SILVERBERG:

I think the door should be

10

open on all the agreements, because until that door is

11

open under section 2 -- as long as that door is open

12

under section 2, then we don't have the concern about

13

parties making the terms of arbitration so onerous or

14

burdensome that they would not be able to even access the

15

arbitral forum.

16

in not just in this case, but in the bigger picture.

17

Courts must remain open to protect people.

18

And that's really a huge concern in --

I would venture to say that there are many

19

people in this room who are subject to arbitration

agreements, and they don't even know, through --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT T. FRIEDMAN

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

MR. FRIEDMAN:

24

I'm hearing terms like "safe thing to do."

25

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

And in response to -- I think it was a question from

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Scalia, I'm hearing my colleague state that

2

there is concern that the arbitrator is not going to

3

apply State law.

4

This is merely distrust of arbitrators.

5

This Court has rejected this bias that arbitrators cannot

6

make these decisions.

7

others have sent very, very complicated issues to the

8

arbitrator to decide.

9

an arbitrator, as well as a judge, cannot decide State

And, in fact, this Court and many

There is no reason to believe that

10

law issues of unconscionability, and the arbitrator will

11

have the discretion and the ability to either strike the

12

entire arbitration agreement or strike certain clauses

13

as he or she sees fit.
Furthermore, this type of speculation, this

14
15

fear as to what the arbitrator may do, that was rejected

16

in this Court's decisions in Vimar and PacifiCare, where

17

the Court stated we are going to enforce this, and the

18

arbitrator may do something wrong, may do something

19

right, but at the tail end there will be an ability

20

under section 10 to address it.

21

there.

22

There is no difference

Additionally, this -- this analysis of

23

unconscionability -- I want to reiterate

24

unconscionability is based on a policy decision that --

25

that attacks an agreement that unquestionably has

56
Alderson Reporting Company

1

already been made.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

What is the

3

one-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is

4

a very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we

5

needn't reach because irrespective of everything else,

6

they in their reply, the district court, and the court

7

of appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole

8

four pages were unconscionable, so none of it's

9

enforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's

10

an issue for the court.

11

being not an issue for the court is what, in a sentence or

12

two?

13
14

And the answer to that

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Justice Breyer, I'm sorry.

I'm going to ask you to -JUSTICE BREYER:

15

They said, look, there's a

16

four-page document.

17

is unconscionable, the product of unconscionability, and,

18

therefore, don't enforce it.

19

issue is at least is for the court, because there is no

20

valid agreement here at all, if that's right.

21

They said this four-page document

MR. FRIEDMAN:

That's their claim.

That

No, Justice Breyer, the

22

determination of unconscionability is for the

23

arbitrator.

24

only to the making, not to the issue of

25

unconscionability.

The -- the limited role of the court goes

So the court --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem -- I -- I

2

keep going back to my initial question to you, is you

3

want to parse out what making is from unconscionability,

4

and you want us to say, well, if it's too onerous a fee

5

for arbitration, that goes to the making, because you're

6

depriving the party of -- of an arbitration forum.

7

If it's discovery, that doesn't go to depriving them

8

of anything because the arbitrator could give them more

9

discovery if he or she chose.

10

Am I correct, this is

your argument?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

11

No, Justice Sotomayor, our

12

argument about the onerous fee -- and it would have to

13

be evidence put in by the party opposing counsel -- by

14

the party opposing arbitration, that there was an actual

15

barrier, an impossibly burdensome barrier.

16

come under making; it would be under a -- a Randolph

17

standard or under a First Options standard.

So it does not

There's two areas that we agree are for the

18
19

court.

One is to determine whether or not there's an

20

issue with the making of the agreement.

21

if it's challenged, is to determine whether or not there

22

is indeed access to arbitration.

The other one,

23

The First Circuit in Awuah applied this test

24

very neatly in a very reasonable manner and applied both

25

First Options and Randolph, harmonized those cases, and

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

made a determination that unconscionability is for the

2

arbitrator based on a clear and unmistakable delegation.

3

But issues as to whether or not --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If there's no access to

5

arbitration, there's no way that you can leave that

6

issue to the arbitrator, is there?

7

MR. FRIEDMAN:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Exactly, Justice Scalia.
Because you never get to

the arbitrator.

10

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Exactly, Justice Scalia.

It

11

fails the First Options test.

There can't be an ability

12

under First Options for the arbitrator to make a

13

decision if there's no access to the arbitrator.

14

those are the two tests.

15

think I'm hearing is my colleague is saying that the

16

arbitrator can decide nothing; the arbitrator should

17

decide nothing, notwithstanding this Court's regular

18

holdings sending very, very complicated matters to the

19

arbitrator.

20

decide these issues of unconscionability as well as a

21

judge can.

In -- in this case, what I

In this case, the arbitrator can absolutely
