 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (10:05 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 13299, Clark versus Rameker. 
 Mr. Shanmugam. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 This case concerns the Bankruptcy Code's 

11

retirement funds exemption.  By its plain terms, that 

12

provision categorically exempts funds that have been set 

13

aside for retirement in certain taxexempt retirement 

14

accounts.  Funds in an inherited individual retirement 

15

account qualify for the exemption first because they 

16

were set aside for retirement when they were deposited 

17

in the account, and second, because an IRA remains tax 

18

exempt after it passes to a beneficiary upon the death 

19

of its initial owner. 

20

 Respondents ask this Court to exclude 

21

inherited IRAs by engrafting an additional limitation on 

22

to the statute.  Under their interpretation, the funds 

23

must be in an account that not only is tax exempt, but 

24

also possesses certain "objective features." 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It's true, I think, that

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Respondents have to explain why their position 

2

doesn't commit us to a difficult casebycase 

3

adjudication down the line, and yours is a more simple 

4

approach.  On the other hand, it seems to me that you 

5

really rendered the words "retirement funds" 

6

superfluous. 

7
8
9
10
11

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I don't think that 

that is true, Justice Kennedy. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I mean, the words in the 

bankruptcy statute. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Yes.  And  and let me 

12

explain why we think that retirement funds are not 

13

superfluous here.  First of all, we think that 

14

retirement funds serves a clarifying function with the 

15

result that in the event that if Congress were to add 

16

something to one of the many tax provisions that are 

17

incorporated into the provision, that is not a 

18

retirement account, that would be excluded. 

19

 In other words, the phrase "retirement 

20

funds" makes clear that only funds that have been set 

21

aside in a retirement account are exempted. 

22

 But I want to say something more broadly 

23

about this argument concerning superfluity, which I 

24

think is really at the core of Respondents' textual 

25

argument here.  I think that argument really

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

misapprehends, with respect, the structure of the 

2

statute.  It may very well be true that at least as 

3

matters currently stand, the phrase "retirement funds" 

4

does not independently exclude anything from the scope 

5

of the statute.  But this statute, of course, includes a 

6

"to the extent that" clause.  And our interpretation 

7

gives the phrase "retirement funds" meaning.  It gives 

8

it a broader meaning.  Retirement funds 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But, Mr. Shanmugam, it 

10

could have meaning if it were read to refer to the 

11

debtor's retirement fund, not anyone's retirement fund. 

12

 And let me ask you one disturbing feature of 

13

this.  Congress was very careful when it crafted 

14

exemptions from the bankrupt estate, like the homestead 

15

exemption.  It said what, 22  something over $22,000, 

16

the car, 37something.  Is it likely that Congress would 

17

have created an exemption so large that  this one is 

18

claimed to be $300,000  for funds that are immediately 

19

usable by the bankrupt?  I mean, this big pot of money 

20

gets exempt from  from the creditors' claim, it just 

21

seems incongruous considering how narrow Congress has 

22

made the other exemptions. 

23

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Two points in response to 

24

that.  First, Justice Ginsburg, with regard to the 

25

admittedly very high cap on retirement funds, it is true

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that a beneficiary of an inherited IRA has the ability 

2

to withdraw the funds immediately, though Congress has 

3

created considerable tax incentives for such an 

4

individual not to do so.  But the same could be said of, 

5

for example, an individual who holds a 457(b) account, 

6

that's a retirement account for employees of certain 

7

governmental entities and nonprofits, who has left 

8

employment and then goes into bankruptcy. 

9

 So, too, with regard to an individual who 

10

holds a Roth IRA, at least with regard to the 

11

contributions that the individual made to that IRA. 

12

And, in fact, while the cap limits the amount of money 

13

that can be exempted at $1.25 million, it actually also 

14

contains exceptions for rollover IRAs such that an 

15

individual can exempt essentially an unlimited amount. 

16

All of which is to say that Congress did intend this 

17

exemption to be quite expansive. 

18

 Now, to go to the first part of your 

19

question, Justice Ginsburg, and the text of the statute. 

20

The court of appeals, unlike Respondent  Respondents 

21

here 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How many of those other 

23

items are immediately withdrawn?  Meaning, the Roth IRA 

24

has the 10 percent penalty if you withdraw it. 

25

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

But not with regard to the

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

money that was originally contributed to the account. 

2

That is to say 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No.  Because the taxes 

4

have already been paid.  But there's a penalty.  How 

5

many of those others? 

6

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, there is no penalty 

7

with regard to contributions.  And indeed there is no 

8

penalty with regard to the entire amount to the extent 

9

that it is being used for one of the specified 

10

nonretirement purposes, for which the funds can be 

11

withdrawn without penalty.  And those are the 

12

educational and medical and other purposes that we set 

13

out in our brief. 

14

 The two primary types of accounts for which 

15

money can be withdrawn without penalty are Roth IRAs and 

16

these 457(b)'s that I was referring to a minute earlier. 

17

 Now, I do want to say just one more thing 

18

about the text of the statute in response to Justice 

19

Ginsburg.  The court of appeals, unlike Respondents 

20

here, offered an interpretation under which retirement 

21

funds would mean funds that have been set aside for the 

22

debtor's own retirement.  But the fundamental flaw with 

23

that interpretation is that it reads an additional 

24

limitation into the statute, this debtorbased 

25

limitation.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And as we point out in our brief, all 11 of 

2

the other exemptions in Section 522(d) contain 

3

references to the debtor.  And many of those references, 

4

including the homestead exemption, specifically refer to 

5

uses by the debtor.  And so in order to invoke the 

6

Federal homestead exemption 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How would a retirement 

8

fund  except in this situation an inherited one, 

9

wouldn't that always be a debtor's? 

10

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12
13

Well 
The name is generally a 

debtor's. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, that is certainly 

14

true, which is to say that that limitation would 

15

obviously exclude inherited IRAs and inherited IRAs 

16

alone.  And I would just note parenthetically that if 

17

there were any evidence that Congress had actually 

18

focused on this issue and if in fact Congress's intent 

19

had been to exclude inherited IRAs, this would be a very 

20

odd way of going about effectuating that intent through 

21

this negative inference from the phrase "retirement 

22

funds." 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let's suppose there 

24

are two debtors who are in a somewhat similar situation, 

25

but one simply inherits $300,000 from a parent who dies

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and the other is the beneficiary of an IRA that the 

2

parent had.  Why would Congress want to give 

3

preferential treatment in bankruptcy to the latter and 

4

not the former?  Both of them have  can use the money 

5

immediately. 

6

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Justice Alito, that is 

7

simply because  and this is a very important 

8

"because"  the funds remain in a taxexempt retirement 

9

account.  And while it is true that the degree of tax 

10

deferral in the hands of a beneficiary is perhaps not 

11

quite as great as it is in the hands of an initial 

12

owner, it is still considerable.  The funds remain tax 

13

exempt while they remain in the account.  And while it 

14

is true that the beneficiary of an inherited IRA must 

15

take certain required minimum distributions, the 

16

accountholder, the beneficiary, can stretch out the tax 

17

consequences over the course of her own lifetime. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I tend to think of this 

19

in  in rather simple terms, retirement funds.  Why 

20

would Congress provide this treatment for retirement 

21

funds?  Because it doesn't want debtors to be completely 

22

without means of supporting themselves after they reach 

23

retirement age. 

24
25

 But in this situation, particularly where 
the beneficiary is a relatively young person, the money

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is either all going to be withdrawn immediately, long 

2

before retirement age is reached, or if it's taken out 

3

on a  on an an annual basis, much of the money will be 

4

distributed before retirement.  In this case, it would 

5

be roughly twothirds, wouldn't that be correct, would 

6

be distributed to  to the beneficiary prior to 65? 

7

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I actually don't think that 

8

that is correct as an empirical matter, Justice Alito. 

9

And as we explain in our brief, as long as the annual 

10

rate of return is a reasonable one, it will often be the 

11

case and, indeed, it's a quite plausible scenario, that 

12

a beneficiary will end up with more or roughly the same 

13

amount in the account at retirement as at the time 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, at the very least, Mr. 

15

Shanmugam, it's a oneway ratchet.  You absolutely 

16

cannot add to these funds; is that correct? 

17

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Yes, that is correct. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I mean, that seems like a 

19

strange feature of a retirement fund, that you can't add 

20

to the fund and that, moreover, you have to deplete the 

21

fund at least to a certain amount.  It may not be the 

22

whole thing.  You may try to keep it as a retirement 

23

fund in order to get tax savings, tax benefits for it, 

24

but at least in part you're going to have to deplete the 

25

fund.  You can't add to it.  That doesn't seem like a

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

retirement fund in people's natural understanding of the 

2

language. 

3

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, at the risk of seeming 

4

flip, Justice Kagan, I think that one point that's 

5

important to keep in mind is that this is still 

6

denominated a retirement account.  And why that's actually 

7

substantively important and not just a formalism is 

8

because that has significant tax consequences.  The 

9

funds remain exempt as long as they remain in the 

10
11

account.  And to go to Justice 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Wasn't the purpose of 

12

that, however, to see that the beneficiary wasn't going 

13

to be hit with a huge tax liability if it had to take 

14

the whole thing all at once? 

15

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

But it also gives the 

16

beneficiary the ability to use the funds in the account 

17

for her own retirement. 

18

 Now, just to be clear, we don't think that 

19

whether or not the beneficiary in fact does so is 

20

relevant, precisely because of the language that 

21

Congress chose. 

22

 And, Justice Alito, to go to the underlying 

23

policy justifications here  and I do so with the 

24

proviso that we obviously think that the plain language 

25

disposes of this case without any need to weigh the

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

policy justifications.  But we think that there are, in 

2

fact, important and compelling policy justifications to 

3

support our interpretation, and we think that it is 

4

therefore no accident that seven States in the last 3 

5

years alone have expressly exempted inherited IRAs. 

6

 The first of those policy justifications is 

7

that Congress wanted to link bankruptcy exemption to tax 

8

exemption and there is some evidence in the legislative 

9

history to support that as the policy justification for 

10

this very expansive provision.  After all, Congress 

11

enacted the retirement funds exemption knowing that 

12

there were already other exemptions or exceptions that 

13

covered a vast range of retirement accounts and yet 

14

Congress deliberately chose this very broad language in 

15

order to provide even broader protection and, really, to 

16

link bankruptcy exemption  bankruptcy protection to 

17

tax protection. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why would Congress want to 

do that? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I think really for ease of 

21

application.  Congress in the Tax Code has obviously 

22

already made judgments about which types of retirement 

23

accounts should be subject to special treatment.  And 

24

the retirement funds exemption simply creates congruence 

25

between the Bankruptcy Code and the Tax Code.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Now, to be sure, we don't think that that's 

2

the only relevant policy justification here.  And we do 

3

think that the fact that Congress has made considerable 

4

tax benefits available to the holders of inherited IRAs 

5

is indeed significant.  And Congress for two decades had 

6

provided this ability for the beneficiaries of inherited 

7

IRAs to stretch out the tax consequences over the course 

8

of their entire lifetimes.  And so exempting inherited 

9

IRAs really does encourage beneficiaries to take 

10
11

advantage of those available tax benefits. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But in this very case, I 

12

mean, this was a fund of what, $400,000odd.  The 

13

daughter, the beneficiary, had already spent 150,000 of 

14

that. 

15

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

She had taken out more than 

16

the required minimum distributions before she went into 

17

bankruptcy and then she took out one additional extra 

18

distribution immediately after going into bankruptcy. 

19

But I think it is fair to say that, regardless of the 

20

circumstances of my clients, many individuals who are in 

21

this position will use these inherited IRAs as 

22

retirement tools or at a minimum as longterm financial 

23

planning tools.  And again, it is certainly congruent 

24

with that policy interest, an interest that is expressed 

25

in the relevant tax provisions, to exempt inherited

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

IRAs as well. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Shanmugam, can I go back 

3

to Justice Kennedy's statement, because I wasn't quite 

4

sure I understood your answer.  He asked why did they 

5

use this retirement  "retirement funds" phrase at all 

6

and you said, well, just in case Congress adds something 

7

later to these sections.  And then you thought that 

8

there was a second point, too.  And what was the second 

9

point? 

10

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I think my second point, 

11

Justice Kagan, was simply that the use of the phrase 

12

"retirement funds" really makes clear the purpose of 

13

this provision in a way that I think would obviously not 

14

be clear absent that reference. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, why would that be 

16

important to Congress, that it wanted to clarify the 

17

purpose of the provision, if you're saying that 

18

everything that was currently in, that was currently 

19

that currently received tax protection in these 

20

sections, counted? 

21

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I think that it is 

22

admittedly descriptive.  And to be sure, Congress at the 

23

time it enacted this provision may not have been 100 

24

percent sure that everything in those tax provisions was 

25

in fact a retirement account.  Because if you take a

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

look at Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, it may 

2

be many things, but immediately clear it certainly is 

3

not.  And so Congress may have just wanted to ensure 

4

that only funds that have been set aside in retirement 

5

accounts are exempted, whether with reference to the Tax 

6

Code as it currently stands or with regard to anything 

7

that might subsequently be added to the tax code in the 

8

future. 

9

 But again, I think it's really important to 

10

underscore the structure of this particular provision. 

11

I think when you have a statute that contains a phrase 

12

like "to the extent that," it is in fact entirety 

13

natural for what comes before that clause, the 

14

antecedent, if you will, to set out a broad category 

15

which is then narrowed by the "to the extent that" 

16

clause. 

17

 And so, for example, if you had a statute 

18

that created a tax break for sports teams to the extent 

19

that they are members of the major professional sports 

20

leagues, you wouldn't immediately think that the phrase 

21

"sports teams" has to somehow do some exclusionary work. 

22

It would be perfectly natural to view "sports teams" as 

23

an incredibly broad category that could include little 

24

league teams as well, but then view the "to the extent 

25

that" clause to narrow it to teams that play in Major

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

League Baseball or the National Football League. 

2

 So too here, "retirement funds" simply 

3

refers to funds that have been set aside for retirement 

4

and the "to the extent that" clause narrows that broad 

5

category to funds that have been set aside and remain in 

6

the enumerated types of retirement accounts. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you still have 

8

the problem of figuring out set aside, you know, by 

9

by whom.  It seems to me that if you inherit one of 

10

these IRAs and somebody, you know, asked you about it, 

11

you could say, well, my mother  you know, you wouldn't 

12

say, would you, my mother left me a retirement account? 

13

You would say my mother left me $300,000. 

14
15
16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, you might say either 

of those things, Mr. Chief Justice. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I know, but I think 

17

it's more likely that you would be describing  if you 

18

said a retirement account, it would seem to me to be 

19

confusing to the normal English speaker, while if you 

20

say what the amount is, I mean, that's what you got and 

21

you could take it all out the next day, which is why the 

22

retirement aspect would seem to be incidental. 

23

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I don't think that 

24

there actually is anything odd about that, and I think 

25

in part that's because of what these accounts actually

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are.  We refer to them as inherited individual 

2

retirement accounts, and there are a few references to 

3

inherited IRAs in the statute, but they really remain 

4

individual retirement accounts in the most relevant 

5

sense. 

6

 I don't think there's really any dispute 

7

that, even in the hands of a beneficiary, an individual 

8

retirement account remains tax exempt under Section 

9

408(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not sure why tax 

11

exemption is the point.  I thought the point of 

12

retirement funds was that you would keep the money to a 

13

certain designated age, 591/2.  I think that's what 

14

your opponent is arguing.  The tax consequences are 

15

irrelevant to the Roth IRA, so it can't be that tax 

16

exemption is the meaning of a retirement fund. 

17

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

But I think, Justice 

18

Sotomayor, that is what it means in the context of this 

19

statute.  And our interpretation 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But why?  This includes 

Roth IRAs. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Right.  The Roth IRAs remain 

23

tax exempt.  That is to say, as long as the funds are in 

24

the account, they remain tax exempt. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

They are tax exempt,

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

period, because taxes were paid when the money was put 

2

in. 

3

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

That's correct.  But they 

4

also remain tax exempt while they're in the account. 

5

And so to give you an example, if, for instance, you 

6

have an IRA or a Roth IRA and you engage in certain 

7

transactions, you move funds out of a particular stock 

8

and move them into another stock, you would ordinarily 

9

have to pay capital gains.  But as long as they remain 

10

in the account, they are not subject to taxation. 

11

That's all that "tax exempt" means in the statute. 

12

 But I think more broadly, our interpretation 

13

of the statute really reads the statute as an integrated 

14

whole.  To be sure, it might be a very different statute 

15

if it stopped after the phrase "retirement funds," and 

16

someone might be able to argue, for instance, that if 

17

they put money aside in a general purpose investment 

18

account, that would qualify as long as they intended to 

19

use those funds for retirement. 

20

 But under our interpretation, "retirement 

21

funds" has to be read in the context of the "to the 

22

extent that" clause, and that clause really explains how 

23

it is that the funds are set aside for retirement. 

24

Funds have to be set aside in one of the enumerated 

25

types of accounts in order to qualify.  And I think this

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discussion really points up the fundamental textual flaw 

2

with Respondents' interpretation. 

3

 Respondents talk at great length in their 

4

brief about the supposed objective features that define 

5

a retirement account.  As we explain in our reply brief, 

6

many of those features are not shared by all of the 

7

enumerated accounts in the statute.  But more 

8

importantly, Congress specified, Justice Sotomayor, the 

9

one objective feature that matters for purposes of the 

10

application of the exemption, and that is the taxexempt 

11

status of the funds in the account, and that is all that 

12

is required in order to trigger this very expansive 

13

provision. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So for your purposes, you 

15

wouldn't need  I mean, you would be  you would have 

16

a, I think, an airtight case if the statute didn't use 

17

the word "retirement funds," it just exempted funds 

18

in  in an account that is exempt from taxation, 

19

period? 

20

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

It  it may very well be, 

21

Justice Ginsburg, that such a statute would have the 

22

same meaning, at least as the Tax Code is currently 

23

constituted.  But again, we think that it gives meaning 

24

to the word "retirement," which is really the only term 

25

that Respondents argue would be superfluous under our

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretation, by saying that the word "retirement" 

2

serves a clarifying function.  It makes clear that only 

3

funds that have been set aside in retirement accounts 

4

can be exempted.  And so if Congress were, say, to tack 

5

some new form of educational savings account onto the 

6

back end of Section 408 of the Tax Code, money that is 

7

set aside in that account would be excluded and that 

8

would be a circumstance under which the term 

9

"retirement" would do some additional work. 

10

 But I think it's important to underscore, 

11

and this is why I really want to focus on the structure 

12

of this particular statutory provision, that "retirement 

13

funds" has meaning under our interpretation.  It is a 

14

broader category which the phrase "to the extent that" 

15

then narrows.  It is simply that the word "retirement" 

16

does not necessarily do any exclusionary work.  But that 

17

does not mean that the word "retirement" is superfluous. 

18

It simply means that as a matter of natural grammar 

19

Congress started with a broader category, retirement 

20

funds, and then proceeded to narrow it with the "to the 

21

extent that" clause that follows. 

22

 Our interpretation naturally follows from 

23

the structure of the text of the statute and it is 

24

certainly preferable as a textual matter to Respondents' 

25

interpretation, which, however it is sliced, ultimately

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reads an additional limitation into the text of the 

2

statute.  And this is not the paradigmatic sort of 

3

statutory interpretation case where 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it would just be 

5

defining "retirement funds" to mean the debtor's 

6

retirement funds. 

7

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

And that is the additional 

8

limitation that the court of appeals read into the 

9

statute.  I would respectfully submit that that is not 

10

quite the interpretation that Respondents are advancing. 

11

But this is the one exemption in Section 522(d) that 

12

contains no reference to the debtor.  And if Congress 

13

had intended to set  to limit the provision to funds 

14

that have been set aside for the debtor's own 

15

retirement, Congress certainly knew how to say so. 

16

 And I would just say one other thing before 

17

reserving the balance of my time, and that is, that this 

18

is not the paradigmatic statutory interpretation case 

19

where you have the text of the statute on the one hand 

20

and the legislative history of this statute on the 

21

other.  There is no relevant legislative history here. 

22

There is no evidence in the long history of BAPCPA 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So all we have is the 

statute on one hand and common sense on the other. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I would respectfully submit

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that if you think that this is that sort of case, that 

2

seven State legislatures might have a beef with that, 

3

Justice Kennedy, because seven States 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Could you explain in that 

5

context?  You said something about uniformity.  Seven 

6

states isn't a particularly high percentage of the 

7

States.  Does the  does the debtor's home State  has 

8

the debtor's home State adopted this exemption? 

9

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

No, Justice Ginsburg.  But 

10

what is really unique about this exemption is that it 

11

applies to individuals regardless of whether they opt 

12

for the Federal or the State exemption regime.  So this 

13

was a case in which my clients, Petitioners, opted for 

14

the Wisconsin exemption regime, but were entitled to 

15

invoke this exemption precisely because it applies 

16

regardless of which regime debtors proceed under. 

17

 And in our view, that is an additional 

18

policy argument in addition to the ones that I set out 

19

earlier that supports our interpretation.  Congress 

20

clearly wanted to provide uniformity across the Federal 

21

and State regimes.  Our interpretation provides that 

22

uniformity.  I am sure 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So would the other 

24

interpretation that says it has to be the debtor's 

25

retirement account.

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, no, because under that 

2

interpretation, by virtue of the fact that States have 

3

as a policy matter opted to provide protection for 

4

inherited IRAs, you would have disuniformity, depending 

5

on whether or not an individual was proceeding under the 

6

exemption regimes of one of these States. 

7

 Justice Kennedy 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9

Well, if we  if we 

look  if we look to what the States did, are there 

10

some statements, some recitation of purpose that does 

11

weigh in on the common sense side of the equation in 

12

your favor; in other words, the States were doing this 

13

for some for some particular reason? 

14

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

We have been unable to find 

15

any legislative history in those seven States and we 

16

have certainly looked for it.  I would respectfully 

17

submit that the policy interests are the ones that I've 

18

articulated.  And in addition to the ones I've 

19

articulated, I would just add that our interpretation 

20

does provide additional encouragement for individuals to 

21

save for retirement in the first instance, knowing that 

22

if they leave funds to an intended beneficiary, those 

23

funds will be protected in the event that the 

24

beneficiary goes into bankruptcy. 

25

 My point is simply that in the absence of

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

any legislative history, this is not a case in which 

2

this Court should weigh the policy judgments itself and 

3

impose them on the broad language that Congress actually 

4

wrote.  It should give effect to that language and if 

5

the  in the event that Congress wants to create an 

6

exception, it can obviously do so. 

7

 And I would reserve the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Ms. Spinelli.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The parties agree that retirement funds are 

15

funds set aside for the day when an individual stops 

16

working.  Funds in an inherited IRA do not meet that 

17

definition.  When the beneficiary of an inherited IRA 

18

files for bankruptcy, the funds in the inherited IRA are 

19

no longer set aside for the original owner's retirement, 

20

nor are they set aside for the beneficiary's retirement. 

21

The beneficiary of an inherited IRA can withdraw all the 

22

funds in the account at any time for any reason without 

23

restriction. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that's true of a 

beneficiary who receives a retirement fund from an

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employersponsored retirement account.  And there is at 

2

least one amici, Tribune, who says that makes  why 

3

would we impute into  to Congress a desire to treat 

4

employersponsored retirement funds differently from 

5

employeesponsored funds? 

6

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Two responses to that, 

7

Justice Sotomayor.  First, as we point out in our brief, 

8

that is a situation that's very unlikely to arise, 

9

because in most qualified retirement plans, including 

10

401(k)'s, the plan provides that beneficiaries have to 

11

take the funds in the account in a lump sum.  That's the 

12

reason Congress in Section 402(c)(11) of the Tax Code 

13

provided that nonspousal beneficiaries of such accounts 

14

can roll those funds over into an inherited IRA. 

15

 The other point, though, is that qualified 

16
17

retirement plans 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But an inherited IRA is 

18

tax exempt.  It's  it can't be alienated.  So in 

19

bankruptcy, that would still be protected. 

20

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Let me  let me clarify, 

21

Justice Sotomayor.  Qualified retirement plans, 

22

including 401(k)'s, are subject to the provision in 

23

ERISA that requires that they be nonalienable.  Because 

24

of that, those plans never come into the bankruptcy 

25

estate to begin with under Section 541(c)(2) of the

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Bankruptcy Code. 

2

 IRAs are not subject to that requirement of 

3

ERISA.  So there is a difference in treatment between 

4

401(k)'s and IRAs to begin with.  That is the result of 

5

Congress's conscious decision in ERISA not to make IRAs 

6

subject to that requirement.  It has 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

8

 MS. SPINELLI: 

9
10
11

Please.  I'm sorry. 
It doesn't  I don't think 

it affects the interpretation of this specific 
provision. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I go back to your 

12

initial point, and just  I mean, it seems to me that 

13

these are kind of hybrids.  You were saying, oh, they 

14

are nothing like retirement accounts for the  for the 

15

reasons that you gave.  But they are something like 

16

retirement accounts, which is that they are taxdeferred 

17

and that there is an enormous incentive for people 

18

actually to try to use them as retirement accounts to 

19

the extent that they don't have current pressing needs. 

20

 So, you know, given that, why shouldn't 

21

given the sort of half and half, why shouldn't we just 

22

treat them as retirement accounts, if nothing else for, 

23

than for administrative simplicity? 

24
25

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Justice Kagan, I don't 

believe they are half and half.  I do believe they are

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fundamentally different.  All the  all the retirement 

2

plans that are governed by the enumerated provisions of 

3

the Tax Code share two things in common.  One is that 

4

there is some restriction on the ability to take funds 

5

out prior to 591/2 or retirement age. 

6

 The other is that one can leave the funds to 

7

grow intact until retirement.  Neither of those is true 

8

of an inherited IRA. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, but in a case in which 

10

one inherits one of these things as a young person or 

11

even as a middleaged person, they actually  to the 

12

extent that you don't take the option to take it out at 

13

once, it really looks like a retirement account to a 

14

person. 

15

 So I just did some backoftheenvelope 

16

calculations.  Suppose you inherit a $200,000 IRA. 

17

Looks to me as though you're going  at the age of 

18

about 50 or so.  Looks to me you're going to get a check 

19

for about $5,000 a year, and your account can grow far 

20

more than that. 

21
22
23

 So it ends up sort of looking like one's 
retirement portfolio. 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

It's certainly true that the 

24

accounts can grow depending on the age at which they're 

25

inherited and the rate of return.  There's no question

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about that.  I think the question is whether the 

2

taxexempt treatment of inherited IRAs has anything to 

3

do with retirement.  And I don't think that  that can 

4

be reconciled with the conscious decision that Congress 

5

made not to permit nonspousal beneficiaries of IRAs to 

6

treat the funds as their own. 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would you  would you 

8

agree that it  pursuant to the Petitioner's counsel's 

9

last comment, that it does affect the retirement 

10
11

decision of the original owner? 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

No, I would not, Justice 

12

Kennedy.  Well, actually 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

In other words  in other 

14

words, there's a benefit to  this is an encouragement 

15

for the original owner to retire because he knows that 

16

this can be handed down. 

17

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Two points in response to 

18

that.  First, I think that to the extent such a 

19

motivation exists, it's extremely attenuated.  But more, 

20

importantly, encouraging retirement savings is not a 

21

motivation behind the bankruptcy exemptions.  It 

22

certainly is a motivation behind the Tax Code.  It's not 

23

a motivation behind the bankruptcy exemptions. 

24
25

 Chapter 7 has as its basic bargain the 
notion that the debtor gets a fresh start, that is, a

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discharge of prepetition debt.  And in return for that, 

2

the debtor turns over all prepetition property to the 

3

trustee for equitable distribution among creditors with 

4

legitimate claims. 

5

 Now, there are exceptions to that, which are 

6

the bankruptcy exemptions, which make sure that the 

7

debtor has sufficient assets remaining after the 

8

bankruptcy to provide basic life necessities, and that 

9

includes assets saved to be a substitute for wages in 

10
11

retirement. 
 So the bankruptcy exemptions really balance 

12

a set of competing interests:  On the one hand, the 

13

debtor's interest in obtaining a fresh start; on the 

14

other hand, the creditors' interest in a fair and 

15

equitable distribution on account of their legitimate 

16

claims, and also society at large's interest in ensuring 

17

a continued flow of consumer credit. 

18

 Those interests have been carefully balanced 

19

by Congress, and I submit that it doesn't make sense to 

20

read the text of the bankruptcy exemptions in a way that 

21

furthers the goal of saving for retirement.  That just 

22

doesn't fit into the considerations Congress balanced. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The court below had a 

24

had a simple take on this.  It says that "retirement 

25

funds" means funds set aside for the debtor's own

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

retirement.  Petitioner tells us that you don't defend 

2

that definition, the definition that "retirement funds" 

3

means the debtor's retirement funds.  Is that so? 

4

 MS. SPINELLI: 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, Justice  I apologize. 
Is it so that you do not 

6

defend the position that "retirement funds" means funds 

7

set aside for the debtor's own retirement? 

8
9

 MS. SPINELLI: 

I think our basic position is 

that at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed, which 

10

is at the time that the exemptions are determined and 

11

the only relevant time for purposes of this case, the 

12

funds are not set aside for anyone's retirement.  They 

13

are no longer set aside for the original owner's 

14

retirement because the original owner has died.  They're 

15

not set aside for the debtor's retirement because of the 

16

characteristics that I've previously alluded to.  The 

17

debtor can't make additional contributions, can't roll 

18

them over into his or her own retirement account. 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why are you fighting 

20

Justice Ginsburg?  I just need to understand what you 

21

see as a difference. 

22

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Let me  let me clarify, 

23

Justice Sotomayor and Justice Ginsburg.  I think that 

24

the upshot of our position may well be that it's  it 

25

only  only the debtor's retirement funds are relevant.

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I think that's so because the date on which the 

2

exemptions are determined is the petition date.  And 

3

because of that, I think it's effectively the case that 

4

it is only the debtor's retirement funds that are 

5

relevant. 

6

 Now, that makes sense because the purpose of 

7

the bankruptcy exemptions is to ensure the support of 

8

the debtor and the debtor's dependents. 

9

now, just to respond quickly 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It's just  it's just 

11

puzzling why you want to disassociate yourself from the 

12

clear position of the court below that "retirement 

13

funds" means the debtor's retirement funds.  Why would 

14

you want to do that? 

15
16
17

 MS. SPINELLI: 

I don't want to do that, 

Justice Ginsburg. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You don't?  Because I 

18

suppose one reason I thought you might want to do it is 

19

because in (d) there are a list of, "the following 

20

property may be exempted," and then we have 12 items. 

21

And the first item, number one, the debtor's aggregate 

22

interest; two, the debtor's interest in the motor 

23

vehicle; three, the debtor's interest in furnishings; 

24

four, the debtor's interest in jewelry; five, the 

25

debtor's interest in 1225; six, the debtor's aggregate

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interest in; seven, et cetera, life insurance owned by 

2

the debtor; eight, the debtor's interest; nine, 

3

prescribed health.  You know, I can go through those. 

4

 MS. SPINELLI: 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
And then we get to number 

6

12.  And Number 12, oddly enough, just says retirement 

7

funds. 

8

 MS. SPINELLI: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, but let 
It doesn't say anything 

10

about the debtor.  And moreover, it has four paragraphs 

11

earlier in which it describes retirement funds in which 

12

it says nothing about the debtor.  And then there are 

13

three paragraphs prior to that in which, once again, 

14

we're talking about State exemptions, we talk about the 

15

debtor's interest in real property, et cetera, and then 

16

we say retirement funds. 

17

 MS. SPINELLI: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
So I guess that's the 

19

reason you didn't want to say it means the debtor's 

20

retirement funds. 

21
22
23

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Let me respond to that, 

Justice Breyer. 
 First, just to finish my response to Justice 

24

Ginsburg's question.  We are not abandoning the 

25

reasoning of the court of appeals.  The court of appeals

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

looked at the objective characteristics of inherited 

2

IRAs and said that inherited IRAs are not set aside for 

3

anyone's retirement, and we  that is precisely the 

4

argument that we're advancing. 

5

 Now, Justice Breyer, as to your point, I 

6

don't think that the  the use of the phrase "the 

7

debtor" in those other exemptions at all helps 

8

Petitioner's argument, and this is the reason:  Only the 

9

debtor's interest in property can come into the 

10

bankruptcy estate in the first place.  Section 541(a)(1) 

11



12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, I see your argument 

13

here.  I  I just thought there is no easy answer, one 

14

way or the other, because this is a case where common 

15

sense, frankly, in my case doesn't get me anywhere, and 

16

that's why 

17
18
19

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Well, I think to answer that 

as well 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And I sort of looked at the 

20

statute and the statute kept talking about the debtor's 

21

interest in everything else and then we get to this one, 

22

it says retirement funds. 

23
24
25

 MS. SPINELLI: 

That's correct, Justice 

Breyer. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So I thought it means

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

retirement funds. 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

But the reason that these 

3

other  and by the way, this appears on Page 5A of the 

4

appendix to the red brief.  The reason that the other 

5

Federal exemptions use the term "the debtor" is in order 

6

to set a cap on the value of the exemption.  So as you 

7

said, (d)(1) says, "The debtor's aggregate interest not 

8

to exceed a certain amount in value in real property." 

9

 (2) is "The debtor's interest not to exceed 

10

a certain amount in value in one motor vehicle."  The 

11

use of "the debtor" there does not suggest that the 

12

exemption is limited to the debtor's interest in 

13

property.  That's already implicit because under 

14

541(a)(1), only the debtor's interest in property can 

15

come into the estate in the first place, so only the 

16

debtor's interest in property is exempt. 

17

 The reason similar language doesn't appear 

18

in (d)(12) is that the cap on the value of the 

19

retirement funds exemption appears elsewhere in the 

20

statute at Section 522(n). 

21

 There are also certain  just to offer a 

22

complete response to this, there are also certain of the 

23

exemptions that talk about assets for the use 

24

of 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You don't have to, on my

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

account, go into this, because I was just giving that as 

2

an example of why I find this not an easy case.  I don't 

3

see an easy answer to it.  That's all.  I  I 

4

understand your point and that's why you're making a 

5

different point of what retirement funds are. 

6

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Well, I think once  once 

7

one agrees that retirement funds are funds set aside for 

8

retirement, this does become a fairly easy case, because 

9

these funds are not set aside 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

 MS. SPINELLI: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh, no, but they were. 
They were at one time. 
And so a retirement fund is 

13

a fund that was set aside for retirement.  At some point 

14

in time, someone set aside for retirement.  Now the 

15

question is, they were set aside for retirement and no 

16

one denies that and so 

17

 MS. SPINELLI:

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19

That's correct. 
 do they change their 

nature because a different person now owns the fund? 

20

 MS. SPINELLI: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And they do 
Now, if you were talking 

22

about pearl earrings, you would say they stay pearl 

23

earrings no matter who retains it.  If you say 

24

retirement funds, you say, but they were retirement 

25

funds.  When did they change their nature?  And at that

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

point you have to make your argument, which I think is a 

2

more  is complicated, but perhaps I understand and he 

3

makes his argument and says, let's keep this simple. 

4

They were retirement funds, period, okay?  And that 

5

that's where I am, if you want to know.  I mean, that's 

6

 I have to figure it out. 

7

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Justice Breyer, two  two 

8

points.  First, the nature  unlike a pearl earring, 

9

the nature of these funds fundamentally changes when the 

10

original owner dies and the interest passes to a 

11

nonspousal beneficiary.  And one thing that might help 

12

make that clearer is the difference between what happens 

13

when a spousal beneficiary receives the interest and 

14

when a nonspousal beneficiary receives the interest. 

15

 A spousal beneficiary can treat the 

16

retirement funds as her own.  She can roll them over 

17

into her own retirement accounts.  She can make 

18

contributions.  There's a penalty for taking the funds 

19

out prior to age 59 1/2, assuming it's a traditional 

20

IRA. 

21

 None of those things are true of inherited 

22

IRAs, which require the nonspousal beneficiary to begin 

23

taking the funds out immediately. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Spinelli, here's one 

thing that's a little bit perplexing to me.  These are

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not arcane accounts.  Tons and tons of people have IRAs 

2

and they die every day, and then they're inherited IRAs. 

3

So, I mean, this is something that applies to masses of 

4

people, and it seems to me that if  if Congress meant 

5

to exclude these inherited IRAs, why wouldn't it have 

6

said so?  This is not like a hidden thing and then all 

7

of a sudden you realize, oh, that was there.  We should 

8

have said something about it.  And this is  this is 

9

pretty obvious that an enormous number of people are 

10

going to have these accounts and you write language that 

11

suggests because of the listing of the sections, that 

12

these are  you know, these accounts are in those 

13

sections, why wouldn't have Congress done something more 

14

explicit to exclude them? 

15

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Well, Justice Kagan, I 

16

believe Congress did exclude them by using the phrase 

17

"retirement funds" as to doing something more explicit. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, that's at the least a 

19

very ambiguous way to exclude them.  Then we have to get 

20

into this whole question of what did they mean when they 

21

said retirement funds?  Are these retirement funds?  In 

22

what way are they retirement funds?  I mean, that's 

23

pretty 

24
25

 MS. SPINELLI: 

As  as to whether Congress 

could have done something more explicit, I think one

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thing that's important to understand is that inherited 

2

IRAs are not some special kind of account.  Rather, 

3

they're simply an IRA of whatever type, a traditional 

4

IRA, a Roth IRA, any other kind of IRA that has been 

5

passed to a nonspousal beneficiary, and the same thing 

6

is true of qualified retirement plans. 

7

 For all of those plans, under our reading, 

8

as they are all exempt in the hands of the original 

9

owner and they are all exempt in the hands of a spousal 

10

beneficiary.  It's only the fundamental change in 

11

treatment when they are inherited by a nonspousal 

12

beneficiary that makes them not retirement funds.  And 

13

so for that  for that reason, I think it was perfectly 

14

understandable of Congress to put the limit "retirement 

15

funds" into the statute. 

16

 And I also think, Justice Kennedy, that  I 

17

hope that that starts to answer your question as to why 

18

our reading doesn't commit the courts to a difficult 

19

casebycase approach.  I don't believe it does.  I 

20

think the analysis is actually quite similar to the 

21

analysis this Court engaged in in Rousey where it had to 

22

answer the question, is a traditional IRA similar to a 

23

stock bonus, pension, profit sharing or annuity plan. 

24

 In that case, the Court framed the question 

25

as:  Do the objective characteristics of the account

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

make this more like those plans, which the Court saw as 

2

substitutes for wages, or more like simply a 

3

taxdeferred savings account.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why do you suppose seven 

States have provided an exemption for inherited IRAs? 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

I don't know, Justice Alito, 

7

but I would say that States frequently do provide more 

8

generous exemptions than the Federal government, and 

9

but, you know, the unlimited homestead exemption that's 

10

available in some States is a good example.  I don't 

11

believe that it's consistent with the structure and 

12

purpose of the bankruptcy exemptions to permit a debtor 

13

to exempt a potentially unlimited amount of funds that 

14

can be used for current consumption that are not in any 

15

way set aside for the debtor's own retirement.  There is 

16

no other exemption in the bankruptcy exemptions that 

17

works that way, that withholds that kind of unlimited 

18

amount of free cash from creditor's legitimate claims. 

19
20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can  can I go back to the 

language? 

21

 MS. SPINELLI: 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Of course. 
The retirement funds, your 

23

definition of retirement funds, are there any retirement 

24

funds that do not fall within the denominated sections 

25

under your definition?

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. SPINELLI: 

If one looked at the phrase 

2

"retirement funds" in isolation, I think it could have a 

3

much broader meaning.  So it could include, you know, 

4

the cash in a box under the bed that someone is saving 

5

for retirement.  The fact that Congress chose to link 

6

the exemption to the specific taxexempt accounts 

7

covered by the enumerated sections of the tax code, I 

8

think, makes clear that "retirement funds" has to be 

9

understood in that context and that an objective 

10

interpretation of the phrase "retirement funds" is more 

11

appropriate, and I think here we agree with Petitioners 

12

than a subjective interpretation. 

13
14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

the extent that" language doing there? 

15

 MS. SPINELLI: 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

17

 MS. SPINELLI: 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

21

Well 
Because that does seem a 

kind of narrowing language, but 

18

20

Well, then what's the "to 

I don't believe 
 on your objective test, 

there would be nothing to narrow. 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

I don't believe it 

22

necessarily is narrowing language.  I mean, the phrase 

23

"lawyers to the extent they are women" doesn't suggest 

24

that all women are lawyers.  And I think the same thing 

25

is true here.  These set up two independent

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

requirements, which is how all the courts that have 

2

addressed the question have viewed it.  Were that not 

3

so, Congress would not have needed to write this 

4

elaborate phraseology.  It could have simply said we 

5

exempt funds in an account that's exempt from taxation. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm sorry.  I didn't get 

7

that.  Because lawyers to the extent that they are 

8

women, does seem  it's saying, you know, we have this 

9

big category, it's lawyers, and now we have a smaller 

10

category, which is women lawyers, so the "to the extent 

11

that" takes you from the big category to the small 

12

category. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes, I agree with Justice 

14

Kagan's comment.  And you argue against your own 

15

boxunderthebed analogy by, as Justice Kagan 

16

indicates, saying that "to the extent" is  indicates 

17

that retirement funds may be greater than what's in the 

18

clause.  It seems to me that you should argue the other 

19

way around, as Justice Kagan is indicating.  Or am I 

20

missing something? 

21

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Let me try to explain again. 

22

I think that  and maybe this was not a good example, 

23

but I think that the phrase "lawyers to the extent they 

24

are women" does not suggest that all women are lawyers, 

25

which I think is what Petitioner's reading suggests.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"Retirement funds to the extent that those funds are in 

2

a fund or account" suggests that all funds in such a 

3

fund or account are retirement funds.  I don't think 

4

that's logically true.  So 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I might have lost 

6

you, but no one says "lawyers to the extent they are 

7

women."  They say "lawyers who are women." 

8

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Correct.  But nonetheless, I 

9

think that the phrase "to the extent that" is extremely 

10

helpful to our analysis, because if it weren't the case 

11

that these are two independent requirements that phrase 

12

wouldn't be necessary.  It would merely be necessary to 

13

say "funds in a fund or account that is exempt from 

14

taxation." 

15

 That wasn't what Congress did. 

Congress 

16

chose to use the phrase "retirement funds."  We think 

17

that choice should be given effect.  And this is a 

18

particularly odd statute in which to read the phrase 

19

retirement funds out of the statute altogether, as 

20

Petitioners' reading would do, because it is the direct 

21

object of the exemption, and it's the purpose of the 

22

exemption.  The purpose of the exemption is to ensure 

23

that debtors are allowed to retain assets that they may 

24

need to live on in retirement. 

25

 So it strikes me as quite odd to say that

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"retirements funds" essentially has no function in this 

2

 in this statute.  To the extent that retirement funds 

3

were going to be defined as funds in a fund or account 

4

that is exempt from taxation, Congress could have said 

5

retirement funds defined as or retirement funds, i.e., 

6

but it didn't.  It set up two separate requirements. 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The problem, I mean 

8

basically, is that you're not going to make us go into 

9

subjective intent.  You don't want us to. 

10

 MS. SPINELLI: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Absolutely not. 
That leaves somebody out. 

12

I'm never going to retire says X, but when I'm 70 1/2 

13

I'm going to take that money out of there and buy my own 

14

airplane. 

15

 MS. SPINELLI: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

It doesn't matter 
Okay.  That's beside the 

point. 

18

 MS. SPINELLI: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's absolutely 
While the daughter who 

20

inherited thinks this is fabulous, I'm going to keep it 

21

through my retirement, at least I'll be able to 

22

that's out of the question. 

23

 Okay. 

Once you put that aside, then you're 

24

falling back on, well, are they the retirement funds of 

25

the debtor?  And it's pretty hard to do that  that's

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what the court of appeals did  because of the language 

2

of the rest of the statute. 

3

 And now, once you're past those two points, 

4

then where are we?  Because now it seems what we are 

5

doing is just drawing a line that's somewhat arbitrary. 

6

Makes some sense policywise, but it just seems like a 

7

line that says:  Inherited ones, no; not inherited ones, 

8

yes. 

9
10
11
12
13
14

 MS. SPINELLI: 

There's nothing 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You have some theory behind 

that, but how can I do more than that? 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

There's nothing arbitrary 

about that line, Justice Breyer. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't think it's 

15

arbitrary, either.  But I mean the trouble is what is it 

16

resting on?  If it's not resting on subjective intent, 

17

it's not resting on these words refer to the funds of 

18

the debtor, what does it rest on? 

19

 MS. SPINELLI: 

It's resting on the objective 

20

characteristics of the account, which is precisely what 

21

this Court relied on in Rousey in determining whether 

22

funds were a substitute for wages in retirement.  I 

23

think the question here is quite similar:  Are these 

24

funds set aside for retirement? 

25

 To answer that question in Rousey, the Court

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

looked to the objective characteristics of the account 

2

and specifically the fact that there was a penalty for 

3

taking funds out before age 591/2, and that the owner 

4

was allowed to leave the funds in until age 701/2, at 

5

which time they had to begin to be withdrawn. 

6

 Neither of those characteristics is present 

7

here.  To the contrary, beneficiaries of an inherited 

8

IRA can take out all of the funds at any time and cannot 

9

leave them intact for their retirement, but have to 

10

begin taking them out right away.  And I think that is, 

11

you know, far from arbitrary.  It rests on a fundamental 

12

difference between retirement funds in the hands of 

13

their original owners or in the hands of spousal 

14

beneficiaries and those same funds in the hands of 

15

nonspousal beneficiaries. 

16
17

 If there are no further questions, we ask 
that the judgment below be affirmed. 

18

Thank you, counsel. 

remaining  I'm sorry, 6 minutes. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 
 I'd like to start with the text of the

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute.  The court of appeals in its opinion defined 

2

"retirement funds" as funds that have been set aside for 

3

the debtor's own retirement.  And I think it's clear 

4

from the arguments this morning that Respondents really 

5

don't defend that interpretation.  And you may be left 

6

wondering why.  Why, I would respectfully submit that 

7

the reason why is the reason that was exposed in Ms. 

8

Spinelli's colloquy with Justice Breyer:  That 

9

interpretation really would nakedly read an additional 

10
11

limitation into the statute. 
 And I want to address Ms. Spinelli's 

12

argument as to why that is not so and explain why that 

13

is in fact so.  If you take a look at the 11 exemptions 

14

that Justice Breyer recited, it is true that to some 

15

extent the references to the debtor simply confirm what 

16

Section 541 already makes clear, namely that the debtor 

17

after all has to have a property interest in the 

18

property in question at the time the debtor goes into 

19

bankruptcy.  But those exemptions also contain 

20

limitations relevant to the debtor's use of the 

21

property. 

22

 And if you take a look at page 5(a) of 

23

Respondent's brief and the text of Section 522(d)(1), 

24

the homestead exemption, that text makes this point 

25

clear.  The homestead exemption reads, and I'm quoting:

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"The debtor's aggregate interest," not to exceed a 

2

certain amount in value, "in real property or personal 

3

property that the debtor or a dependent of the debtor 

4

uses as a residence."  That is precisely the type of 

5

limitation that the court of appeals was reading into 

6

the retirement funds exemption.  And of course, that 

7

sort of limitation is entirely absent.  And it's not 

8

just (d)(1).  You can find them in (d)(3), (d)(4) and 

9

others of the exemptions. 

10

 Now, I think that because of that problem 

11

Respondents instead offer this objective features 

12

interpretation.  But while Ms. Spinelli made some 

13

references to the objective features in the course of 

14

her argument, she didn't actually tell us what those 

15

objective features actually are.  And I think that the 

16

problem, once you start to identify those features, is 

17

that it inevitably leads you into a factintensive 

18

casebycase analysis as to whether a particular 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Not necessarily.  I think 

20

her point  now, it's been very helpful to me, the 

21

argument, but I think that it's a by and large point. 

22

You see, by and large the funds in the hands of the 

23

original setteraside of the funds.  By and large, they 

24

are used for retirement of that person and therefore, 

25

they are retirement funds.  Not always, but by and

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

large. 

2

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4

Well 
And in the hands of the 

inheriting person, by and large they are not. 

5

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well 
And so that's why she 

7

thinks the one falls within and the other falls without 

8

the phrase "retirement funds." 

9

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, let's focus on the 

10

objective features that Respondents did identify in 

11

their brief, and two of those features were limitations 

12

on early withdrawals and required minimum distributions 

13

after retirement.  And as we explained in our reply 

14

brief, at least as to some of these types of accounts, 

15

even in the hands of the initial owner those limitations 

16

would not apply. 

17

 And I would respectfully submit that if 

18

there is one thing that is reasonably clear from the 

19

legislative history, it's that Congress certainly wanted 

20

to provide protection for all of these types of accounts 

21

when they are in the hands of the initial owner.  And 

22

any sort of test like that, a byandlarge test, would be 

23

a recipe for chaos in the lower courts, as bankruptcy 

24

courts have to try to figure out whether particular 

25

types of accounts, even in the hands of initial owners,

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

would qualify. 
 And I want to say just one other thing about 
text.  Ms. Spinelli referred to this 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Could you be more specific? 

5

What are the particular aspects of other accounts that 

6

you think would not qualify? 

7

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

The limitations on early 

8

withdrawals, which do not apply to Roths and to 457(b)s 

9

and  and with regard to Roths, that is true only with 

10

regard to contributions, but, of course, the 

11

contributions to a Roth can be a very substantial part 

12

of the funds in the account.  And then required minimum 

13

distributions after a retirement, which Roth IRAs do not 

14

possess. 

15

 And I want to say just one other thing on 

16

the text with regard to Rousey.  Rousey itself obviously 

17

involved very different language, and Congress was 

18

legislating against the backdrop of Rousey when it 

19

adopted the retirement funds exemption.  But when it 

20

adopted that exemption, it contained no limitation on 

21

whether or not the payments were being received on 

22

account of age, but instead swept much more broadly, 

23

focusing on the accounts and focusing on the one 

24

objective feature of the accounts that matters, the 

25

taxexempt status of the funds in the account.
