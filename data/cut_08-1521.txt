ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN GURA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. GURA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Although Chicago's ordinances cannot survive

12

the faithful application of due process doctrines, there

13

is an even simpler, more essential reason for reversing

14

the lower court's judgment.

15

text, as understood by the people that ratified it,

16

mandates this result.

17

The Constitution's plain

In 1868, our nation made a promise to the

18

McDonald family; they and their descendants would

19

henceforth be American citizens, and with American

20

citizenship came the guarantee enshrined in our

21

Constitution that no State could make or enforce any law

22

which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of

23

American citizenship.

24
25

The rights so guaranteed were not trivial.
The Civil War was not fought because States were

5

government and the personal guarantees of the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The rights

Of course, this

7

argument is contrary to the Slaughter-House Cases, which

8

have been the law for 140 years.

but it's a big -- it's a heavy burden for you to carry

10

It might be simpler,

to suggest that we ought to overrule that decision.
MR. GURA:

11

Your Honor, the Slaughter-House

12

Cases should not have any stare decisis effect before

13

the Court.

14

is extremely wrong, when there is a great consensus that

15

it was simply not decided correctly, especially in a

16

constitutional matter, it has less force.

17

The Court has always found that when a case

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What injustice has --

18

has been caused by it that we have to remedy?

19

States have relied on having no grand juries; States

20

have relied on not having civil trials in certain money

21

cases; they have relied on regulating the use of

22

firearms based on us, the Court, not incorporating the

23

Privileges and Immunities Clause in the way that you

24

identify it.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What -- in which ways

has ordered liberty been badly affected?
MR. GURA:

3

Justice Sotomayor, States may

4

have grown accustomed to violating the rights of

5

American citizens, but that does not bootstrap those

6

violations into something that is constitutional.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you saying that the

8

rights -- if you could clarify your conception of

9

privileges and immunities.

Am I right in thinking that

10

11

no Second Amendment, as you envision privileges and

12

immunities?

Immunities Clause we have wonderful historical

There are -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Gura, do you think it's

6

at all easier to bring the Second Amendment under the

7

Privileges and Immunities Clause than it is to bring it

8

under our established law of substantive due process?

9

MR. GURA:

10

It's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it easier to do it under

11

privileges and immunities than it is under substantive

12

due process?

13

MR. GURA:

It's easier in terms, perhaps,

14

of -- of the text and history, the original public

15

understanding of --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no.

I'm not talking

17

about whether -- whether the Slaughter-House Cases were

18

right or wrong.

the Privileges and Immunities Clause your definition,

20

does that make it any easier to get the Second Amendment

21

adopted with respect to the States?

substantive due -- I mean, you know, unless you're

bucking for a -- a place on some law school faculty --

5

MR. GURA:

No.

No.

I have left law school

6

some time ago, and this is not an attempt to -- to

7

return.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean, what you

argue is the darling of the professoriate, for sure,

10

but it's also contrary to 140 years of our jurisprudence.

11

Why do you want to undertake that burden instead of just

12

arguing substantive due process?

13

think it's wrong, I have -- even I have acquiesced in it.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. GURA:

Which, as much as I

Justice Scalia, we would be

16

extremely happy if the Court reverses the lower court

17

based on the substantive due process theory that we

18

argued in the Seventh Circuit.

19

Seventh Circuit accepted our substantive due process

20

theory, which was our primary theory in the court below,

21

we might not be here, or perhaps we would be here in a

22

different posture.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And, indeed, had the

But that -- that court

24

does not have the prerogative to overturn any of this

25

Court's decisions, and I think it said -- said as much.

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So it was kind of a pass-through in the court of

2

appeals.

3

But I really would like you to answer the

4

question that you didn't have an opportunity to finish

5

answering, and that is:

6

What does the privileges and immunities of United States

7

citizenship embrace?

8
9

MR. GURA:

What other enumerated rights?

Of the unenumerated rights,

Justice Ginsburg?

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. GURA:

Yes.

Well, the framers clearly used

12

language that to them meant rights beyond those

13

guaranteed in the first eight amendments.

14

they spoke about those unenumerated rights, they gave

15

some concrete examples.

16

two categories of unenumerated rights if a claim were

17

before the court under that provision.

And whenever

So I think that there might be

18

If a right is, for example, the sort of

19

right that was mentioned in the Civil Rights Act of

20

1866, the piece of legislation enacted by a

21

supermajority of Congress, where the Congress said, over

22

President Johnson's veto, here are the rights of

23

American citizenship, and they are -- they listed:

24

make and enforce contracts; to sue, be parties, and give

25

evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and

8
Alderson Reporting Company

To

Official

1

convey real and personal property.

That's the sort of

2

right that would be easy to find because there is a

3

contemporaneous source for telling us --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though -- even

5

though a large portion of the population at that time

6

didn't have those rights?

7

MR. GURA:

The large -- the population at

8

the time that did not have those rights needed their

9

protection, primarily in the South, which is why the

10

Civil Rights Act -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, throughout --

12

throughout the nation at the time.

13

MR. GURA:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm sorry.
Did married women at that

15

time across the nation have the right to contract, to

16

hold property, to sue and be sued?

Married women were considered

citizens of the United States, just like children were

this country giving a greater level of protection to --

1

Amendment rights were not always understood well --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does it work just one

3

way?

I mean, if the notion is that these are principles

4

that any free society would adopt, well, a lot of free

5

societies have rejected the right to keep and bear arms.

6

MR. GURA:

As we mentioned -- as we

7

mentioned in our brief, this Court in Benton v. Maryland

8

decided that henceforth American history and tradition

9

are important to consider what rights are protected in

10

this country.

It's true that our friends overseas who

11

have more or less civilized, free societies don't

12

respect rights to the same level that we do.

13

example, England, which is a free society, has a

14

monarchy.

15

They don't have First Amendment protection.

They have hereditary lords in parliament.

17

one expression of this unenumerated rights, natural rights,

MR. GURA:

we have used under substantive due process.

10

Yes.

MR. GURA:

That's correct and, as Judge

O'Scannlain --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

in the Nordyke decision, the Slaughter-House dissenters

Court did in the Glucksberg case.

gun for self-protection against intruders into the home,

5

6

Liberty Clause?

7

MR. GURA:

The Second Amendment is not so

8

limited and neither is the right to arms, even outside

I'm assuming we don't have

11

a Second Amendment for purposes of the substantive due

12

process analysis.

the right to own a gun that is protected by the Liberty

14

Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?

15

right to have it at -- at home, or is the right to

16

parade around the streets with guns?

I'm asking you what is the scope of

MR. GURA:

Is it just the

An unenumerated right to arms in

18

the absence of the Second Amendment would be, perhaps --

19

probably identical to that secured by the Second

20

Amendment, because the Second Amendment codified the

21

understanding of that right that people have

historically had in the country.

JUSTICE ALITO:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In -- in that

2

context, is your position that the rights that are

3

incorporated as essential to the concept of ordered

4

liberty, do they bring all of our decisions with them?

5

When you say the First Amendment is covered, does that

6

mean New York Times v. Sullivan is incorporated as well?

7

right?

17

Court wishes to reconsider any of them for some reason,

19

We believe that those cases

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, I understood the Chief

20

Justice's question -- maybe I misunderstood it, but my

21

understanding of the question as important is this:

22

Under incorporation by reference, the States are bound

23

by the rights in all -- with all of the refinements and

24

sophistication with which we interpret them for the

25

Federal Government.

It's the same.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

You don't just

apply the core of the right.

You apply all of the right

2

as it is elaborated by the cases.
Is -- is that same consequence -- does that

3
4

same consequence follow if we adopt the privileges and

5

immunities interpretation that you are urging upon us?

6

MR. GURA:

Yes, Your Honor, because --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

How does that work?

8

I think that would be useful for either you or

9

Mr. Clement, if you've thought this through.

10

Is this

right different from others?

11

MR. GURA:

Well --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

There are two ways.

One is

13

that -- look at -- all you have to do is look at the

14

briefs.

15

says a million people killed by guns.

16

their -- their gun law has saved hundreds, including --

17

and they have statistics -- including lots of women in

18

domestic cases.

19

20

it's decided by State legislatures; with, it's decided

21

by Federal judges.

I want to see where we're going.

MR. GURA:

Federal judges should carry this

out in the same way that was announced in this Court's
decision in Heller.

So --

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

Heller, I didn't think,

12

explained that with great -- I was dissenting,

13

though.

14

clarity, but that's a dissenter's view.

15
16

I didn't think it explained it with total

(Laughter.)
MR. GURA:

Heller stood for the proposition

17

that some activities are within the core boundaries of a

18

right, and so long as people wish to do something that

19

is literally understood to be a part of the boundaries of

20

the right, it is to be protected, and --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let me be specific, suppose

22

Chicago says, look, by banning handguns not in the

23

hills, not hunting, nothing like that, nothing outside

24

the city -- in the city, we save several hundred human

25

lives every year.

And the other side says, we don't

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think it is several hundred, and, moreover, that doesn't

2

matter.

How do you decide the case?
MR. GURA:

3

We decide that by looking, not to

4

which side has the better statistics, but rather to what

5

the framers said in the Constitution, because that

6

policy choice was made for us in the Constitution.

7

They --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're saying they can

9

have -- no matter what, that the City just can't have

10

guns even if they're saving hundreds of lives -- they

11

can't ban them.
MR. GURA:

12
13

The City cannot ban guns that are

within the common use as protected by the right to arms.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

There's a lot of

15

statistical disagreement on whether the Miranda rule

16

saves lives or not, whether it results in the release of

17

dangerous people who have confessed to their crime, but

18

the confession can't be used.

19

resolve questions like that on the basis of statistics,

20

do we?

21
22
23

MR. GURA:

We don't -- we don't

fact that there is a constitutional right at issue, and

enumerated in the Constitution are entitled to a greater

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under this court's existing jurisprudence,

11

the case for incorporating the Second Amendment through

12

the Due Process Clause is remarkably straightforward.

13

The Second Amendment, like the First and the Fourth,

14

protects a fundamental preexisting right that is

15

guaranteed to the people -- -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Clement, would you

17

comment on Justice Kennedy's question about whether that

18

necessarily incorporates every jot and tittle of the

19

Federal right into the Federal, keeping in mind that

20

with regard to trial by jury in criminal cases, there's

21

a difference.

22

incorporation have to be every bit as broad as the

23

Second Amendment itself?

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

It's nonunanimous juries.

Why does this

in that respect the Sixth Amendment is a bit of an

18

outlier.

know all of the substantive provisions of the Bill of

3

Rights that have been incorporated against the States,

4

this Court has incorporated basically all the

Well, I guess maybe it's Mapp,

is one way of thinking about it.

10

case in which we incorporated a substantive provision?

For most of the provisions and as far as I

Mapp was a procedural

case.

MR. CLEMENT: -- I could quibble about that --

substantive rights, as opposed to procedural rights.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well --

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The procedural cases come

18

in under the due process language, but the substantive

19

cases comes under the word "liberty," and "liberty"

20

picks up the First Amendment and so forth.

21

it it's the word "liberty" that picks up the Second

precisely the same scope as the Second Amendment?

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, sure.

We could quibble

whether -- I think of the Fourth Amendment as more of a

19
Alderson Reporting Company

1

substantive guarantee.

2

to certainly like the First Amendment guarantees that

3

this Court has incorporated through the liberty -- the

4

liberty subclause, if you will, of the Due Process

5

Clause, there too I think this Court -- certainly I

6

understand this Court's jurisprudence as incorporating

7

all of the cases that go along with that.

8
9

But in any event, with respect

So New York Times v. Sullivan is the law of
all 50 States, et cetera, et cetera.

And I think that

10

in a sense the virtue of that approach is probably even

11

more apparent with the Second Amendment than it might be

12

with some other jurisprudence --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess we -- I guess we

14

have applied substantive due process with regard to the

15

necessity of permitting homosexual conduct and with

16

respect to the necessity of permitting abortion on

17

demand.

18

Federal Government than we have adopted for the States

19

in either of those instances, have we?

20

We have not adopted a more rigid rule for the

MR. CLEMENT:

That's also right, Your Honor,

21

though I guess I would stress that I think that,

22

whatever the debate's about substantive due process when

23

it comes to unenumerated rights, I think the gist of

24

this Court's incorporation doctrine is that the textual

25

provisions of the Bill of Rights stand in a favored

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position with respect to incorporation.

2

has its discussion about the standard for unenumerated

3

rights, but it starts that off by saying of course the

4

Bill of Rights are different.

5

of Rights, I think, as I read this Court's selective --

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And so Glucksberg

And, of course, the Bill

They stand in a favored

7

position, but we've never said had to be literally

8

all the way down the line, or we couldn't have done

9

the criminal jury -- nonunanimous criminal jury case.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Again, though, it's

11

interesting that the one place that I -- that I see where

12

the Court has not effectively translated all the case law

13

is one of the procedural rights, the Sixth Amendment

14

criminal jury right.

15

substantive rights -- and I think the alliance here or

16

the similarity between the First and the Second

17

Amendments are very stark in this respect -- this Court

18

has incorporated essentially not just the amendment and

19

not just the right, but all of the jurisprudence as

20

well.

21

And I think with respect to the

And, you know, I would -- just to dwell for

22

a moment if I'd could on the -- on the First and the Second

23

Amendment, I think it's striking, very striking, that if

24

this Court's not going to reconsider its Privileges or

25

Immunities Clause jurisprudence, the Cruikshank case

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

actually stands as very good precedent for incorporating

2

the Second Amendment, just as it was the precedent this

3

Court relied on in incorporating the assembly and petition

4

rights of the First Amendment in the De Jonge case.

5

the reason is Cruikshank -- the whole reason that

6

Cruikshank said the First and Second Amendments aren't

7

privileges of national citizenship is because they were

8

preexisting rights that didn't depend on the

9

Constitution for their existence.

10

And

That seems to me to be a pretty good working

11

definition of what a fundamental right is, one that is

12

so fundamental and basic that it preexisted our very

13

Constitution.

14

cited Cruikshank as favorable precedent for

15

incorporation.

And so it's not surprising that De Jonge

I think the exact same logic would apply to

16
17

the Second Amendment here, and, as I say, I do think the

18

consequence of that, certainly the most logical

19

consequence, would be to carry over the jurisprudence

20

under the Second Amendment.

Now, right now, that's not

21

carrying over a lot, right?

That's carrying over the

22

Heller case.

23

But I think in a way that points up to the

24

fact that one of the virtues of incorporation is that,

25

because the Miller decision of this Court sowed

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

confusion, we don't have substantial Second Amendment

2

jurisprudence.

3

difficult enough to develop the Second Amendment

4

jurisprudence that you wouldn't want to make it more

5

difficult by having to develop a Federal Second

6

Amendment jurisprudence and then some sort of shadow

7

version of that jurisprudence for the States.

8
9

And I would think that it's going to be

And I think in the more recent incorporation
cases, this Court was quite candid that it wasn't going

10

to adopt sort of a shadow version of the Federal

11

guarantee or some watered-down version of the Federal

12

guarantee, but it really saw the virtue of incorporating

13

not just the right but the jurisprudence that came with

14

that right.

15

And so I do think that's in a sense

16

something that counts in favor of incorporating the

17

Second Amendment and doing so through the Due Process

18

Clause, the same way this Court has dealt with the other

19

substantive guarantees of the Bill of Rights.

20

think if you apply that jurisprudence, the case really

21

is very straightforward.

22

compare the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment to

23

the Second Amendment, they have the same textual

24

guarantee to the people, they trace their origins to

25

preexisting rights back to the English Bill of Rights,

And I

In fact, I think if you

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

back to even earlier constitutional history.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's true of the

3

criminal jury trial right, too, all of those things?

4

And yet we don't -- it's not exactly the same.

5

don't see why it has to be exactly the same.

6

understand your argument that it should be substantially

7

the same, but I don't see that there's anything in the

8

text of the Fourteenth Amendment that would justify

9

saying it must be precisely the same, or of any of our

10
11

I just
I can

cases.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well -- and, again, Justice

12

Stevens, you know, since I think that -- that the

13

incorporation clause is -- I mean, the incorporation

14

jurisprudence is, to put it lightly, a gloss on the text

15

of the Due Process Clause --

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Incorporation

17

jurisprudence is -- we haven't had an incorporation case

18

for 30 years or more.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right.

That's right,

20

Justice Stevens.

But I guess I would say is that,

21

putting the Sixth Amendment to one side, which I think

22

is a bit of an outlier in the jurisprudence here, I

23

think the trend of all of this Court's incorporation

24

jurisprudence has been more towards complete

25

incorporation of the right and the jurisprudence.

24
Alderson Reporting Company

So --

Official

1

I mean, Mapp is a perfect illustration.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That still allows

scope, once you determine that the right is

incorporated, for recognizing that the States might have

broader interests that the Federal Government doesn't

7

application of the right, rather than in an effort to

8

determine whether parts of it are incorporated or not.

But I would suppose that would come up in the

Mr. Chief Justice, and I think the same thing can be

11

said for any other one of the other incorporated

12

amendments.

13

the First Amendment.

14

situations that the Federal government confronts that

15

the State governments won't confront the exact analogue

16

situation and vice versa.

17

So I think the same thing might be true in
There are certainly going to be

Now, you know, there may be unique issues

18

about national parks that the States aren't going to

19

have to confront, and the jurisprudence can take that

20

into account.

21

saying that we really are going to have this shadow

22

jurisprudence for one of the provisions.

23

But I think that's far different from

And I think, again, to go back to Mapp just

24

as an illustration, when this Court first incorporated

25

the Fourth Amendment and said, well, we'll talk about

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the exclusionary rule later; maybe we won't incorporate

2

the Fourth -- the exclusionary rule.

3

incorporate the Fourth Amendment's basic guarantee.

4

the trend of later cases was to say, no, kind of in for

5

a penny, in for a pound --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. CLEMENT:

8

We'll just
And

You're -- you're dead right --

-- let's bring the

jurisprudence with --

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- about the majority of

10

the Court, but it's interesting that during this whole

11

period, Justice Harlan staked out a separate position on

12

whether it should be just the substance of the right or

13

the -- every detail.

14

rather than the majority in a number of cases in -- in

the recent years.

about the way in which the Bill of Rights applies to the

2

States?
MR. CLEMENT:

3

Well, I think if we are going

4

to go back, maybe we should go back to the first Justice

5

Harlan, who actually had an -- an approach, I think,

6

that would be much more similar to the approach --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

and that Mr. Gura takes in this case.

10

But there is a difference.

JUSTICE BREYER:

other amendments -- you have the First Amendment's,

the First Amendment expression.
Here we have right in the amendment written

it might be interpreted if you think what it is, is the

right to have a gun to shoot a burglar.

And the way that -- the

They're just

starting with a difference in purposes at the least.

25

And shouldn't that make a difference in how you

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I mean, I guess what

3

I -- what I don't understand is why, given the way that

4

this Court wrestled in the Heller decision with how to

5

basically apply the operative clause in light of the

6

prefatory clause, why one would want to come to a

7

different conclusion --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because the -- one of the

reasons --

10

MR. CLEMENT:

-- with respect to the States.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- at least, is that --

12

you've read, I'm sure, that all the law professors

primarily a right to raise an army through Parliament

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can respond if

you want, briefly.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

I mean, obviously this Court was focused

23

very much on Blackstone's writings in the Heller

24

decision, and I think the majority read Blackstone

25

actually as being primarily concerned with the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

self-defense right, which goes a long way to understand

2

why the Heller decision came out the way that it came

3

out.

4

And I would simply finish by noting that the

5

one thing that I think we can come to a conclusion about

6

Blackstone is the very fact that Blackstone dwelled on

7

the right is good evidence that it's a fundamental right

that should apply to the States.

the concept of ordered liberty?

MR. FELDMAN:

If

Yes, I do, and here's the

reason why.

2

Baltimore, in a -- in a ruling that Chief Justice

3

Marshall said was not a difficult one, although

4

important, that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the

5

States.

6

In 1833, this Court has held in Barron v.

As far as I know, no justice has ever

7

disagreed with that -- with that ruling or suggested he

8

was wrong in so ruling.

9

reason -- and when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed

From -- it was -- the only

10

and ratified in the late 1860s, again, the -- the

11

framers did not directly apply the Bill of Rights to the

12

States.

They gave us some generalities.

13

And the Court has always understood that

14

when it's applying the Due Process Clause, what it asks

15

is not just is something in the Constitution, but is

16

this something that's so fundamental it's a necessary

17

condition --

My goodness --

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it is in the following

sense:

have to look at how that system operates and how the --

5

the right works within that particular system.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if you think

that's right, why wouldn't you think, for all the

22

reasons given in Heller, that the Second Amendment right

23

is essential to our system, whatever it may be with

24

respect to France or England or anywhere else?

25

MR. FELDMAN:

The question that the Court

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was addressing in Heller was not -- again, was not how

2

important the Second Amendment right was, or how

3

implicit it is in our system; it was what did it say and

4

what did the -- what restrictions did the framers of the

5

Second Amendment impose on the Federal Government.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I thought its

7

rationale was that because of its fundamental character,

8

the right to bear arms must be understood as separate

9

from the qualifying phrase of the militia clause, all

10

people, most people in the United States.

11

meaning of the Second Amendment was that there was an

12

individual right to bear arms, and that's because it was

13

fundamental.

14

wrong, it seems to me.

If it's not fundamental, then Heller is

MR. FELDMAN:

15

The public

No, I -- I -- I don't think

16

that that's right.

17

did they impose upon the -- as restrictions upon the

18

government when the Second Amendment was ratified.

19

as to that, it's not a question of whether it's

20

fundamental any more than with the Grand Jury Clause or

21

with the civil jury trial right --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

The question is what right -- what

And

I don't see how you

can read --

24

MR. FELDMAN:

-- under the Seventh Amendment.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

33
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't see how you can

Official

1

read Heller and not take away from it the notion that the

2

Second Amendment, whether you'd want to label it

3

fundamental or not, was extremely important to the framers

4

in their view of what liberty meant.

5

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- it was important, but

6

actually what Heller says is this:

The Second Amendment

7

preexisted the -- its inclusion -- or the right that's

8

in the Second Amendment preexisted its inclusion in the

9

Bill of Rights.

But the reason it was codified, the

10

reason it -- the reason it was put into the Bill of Rights

11

was because the framers were concerned about the Federal

12

Government disarming the militia.

13

The right of self-defense, which had been

14

previously recognized and highly valued, I would agree,

15

was -- had -- according to Heller, quote, "had little to

16

do with its codification" --

The same -- very same reason why the

clause at the beginning -- the militia clause -- we're

self-defense.

wouldn't have been in the Constitution for that.

incorporation, it seems to me, are arguments you should

21

make in favor of regulation under the Second Amendment.

22

We haven't said anything about what the content of the

Second Amendment is beyond what was said in Heller.

All the arguments you make against

MR. FELDMAN:

you make is, well, given this context, you should not be

able to have concealed carry.

right, but that doesn't mean you don't incorporate the

4

Second Amendment to allow you to enforce that type of

5

regulation.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, maybe that's

No, I don't think so.

I think

7

-- the argument that I'm making is that States and local

8

governments under the political process, which as far as

9

we know, if the only issue had been self-defense, the

10

framers would have been satisfied to leave this to the

11

States and to leave this to the political process, and not

12

to put it in the Constitution -- that -- that -- that as

13

far as the right to self-defense goes, that's something

14

that has always been effectively regulated through the

15

political process and especially at the State and local

level.

certainly relevant that in the last 220 years, no

to -- to deny that?

MR. FELDMAN:

It has not led to States doing

it in -- in this country.

The second question --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if they did do it, I

think you'd have to say it's perfectly okay.
MR. FELDMAN:

No, the second -- there would

24

be two questions actually.

One would be was this arbitrary,

25

or is that actually based on a reason that's --

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a sound reason?

2
3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

The reason is guns are

dangerous.
MR. FELDMAN:

The second argument would be,

5

the Court at that point, if in the very unlikely event a

6

that a State or local government tried to do that, then

7

the Court might have to wrestle at that point with the

8

question of the relationship between self-defense and

9

the right to keep and bear arms.

10
11

In other words, this

Court has never said -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But would self-defense be

12

part of liberty under the Due -- substantive meaning of

13

the Due Process Clause?

14

MR. FELDMAN:

I mean, if by that is, do you

15

have a substantive right to self-defense, the Court

16

actually has never answered that question, but I'm

17

willing to accept that there is such a right for --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

said there were two reasons.

20

in your answer to Justice Alito's question?

21

MR. FELDMAN:

And you've given -- you
So you have given us both

Yes, and -- and what I'd say

22

about the right to self-defense is, if -- if the

23

challenge -- if a State or local government banned all

24

firearms it might raise the question of, given that

25

there -- if there is a constitutional right to

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

self-defense, has the State prohibited you from

2

reasonable means of exercising that right?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

But that --

Without repeating that and

4

just so I understand your position, how could some

5

member of the Court write the -- this opinion to say

6

that this right is not fundamental, but that Heller was

7

correct?

8
9

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- the Court would just say

that what Heller held was if you look at the meanings

10

that the words in the Second Amendment had, the common

11

meaning -- as the Court said in the Heller opinion --

12

the common meanings that the word had in 1791, it

13

imposed limitation on the state.

14

right that had not been -- it was not codified in the

15

Constitution, and it said, this self-defense right we

16

need in the Constitution in order -- in order to protect

17

the militia against being disarmed by the Federal

18

Government.

19

It took a preexisting

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That sounds an awful

20

lot to me like the argument we heard in Heller on the

21

losing side.

22

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, it's actually what the

23

Court said in its opinion.

What the Court said in its

24

opinion is the reason it was codified was the concern

25

that the framers had with the -- that the Federal

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Government might disarm the militia.

2

Self-defense according to the Court in Heller, quote,

3

"had little to do with the codification of the right."

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not self-defense.

They said that is the

5

reason it was codified.

6

the function of what was codified.

7

was codified was to enforce the traditional right of the

8

people to bear arms.

9
10

They did not say that that is

MR. FELDMAN:

The function of what

And that -- that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And to say that that wasn't

11

the reason it was codified doesn't say anything about

12

what it consists of.

13

MR. FELDMAN:

That -- that's correct, and

14

I'm not arguing today about what it consists of, but the

15

point being that this was a right that had been -- that

16

the framers as far as we know would have been satisfied to

17

leave to the political process if it was just a question

18

of the feature of it.

19

But today --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me see if I understand

20

your argument.

I thought you said a minute ago that if

21

a State or local government were to ban firearms

22

completely, this Court might hold that that violates

23

substantive due process because the right to use a

24

firearm for self-defense is -- might be held to be

25

implicit in the concept of ordered liberty; is that

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

right?

2

MR. FELDMAN:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's correct.
And -- but I thought you

4

began by saying that the right to keep and bear arms is

5

not implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

The right to keep and bear

7

arms that was recognized -- I don't think actually the

8

right to keep and bear arms itself is.

9

right to self-defense is, and then like other rights,

Perhaps the

10

similar rights, if the Court were to hold that that is

11

constitutionally protected, the question would be is the

12

State now giving you sufficient means to exercise that

13

right?

14

so that you reasonably can exercise that right.

15

would think that would be the only way that that kind of

16

analysis could go, if you start off from self-defense.

Not whatever means you want, but sufficient means
I

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Feldman, let me take

19

your argument at -- at its face value.

20

that the only reason it is there and the only purpose it

21

serves is the militia purpose.

22

purpose just as much defeated by allowing the States to

23

take away the militia's arms as it would be by allowing

24

the Federal Government to take away the militia's arms?

25

MR. FELDMAN:

Let's assume

Yes, but I -- that --

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. FELDMAN:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then so --

But that --- even if you assume that

4

the whole thing turns around the militia prologue, that

5

prologue is just as -- just as important with respect to

6

the State's depriving the people of arms.

7

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, but I don't think the

8

argument -- the primary argument that's being made today,

9

that this is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty or

10

sufficiently fundamental or whichever other formulas -JUSTICE SCALIA:

11
12

You're switching horses

now.

13

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I'm not.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No --

Let's just focus on your

15

argument that -- that -- that deals with the prologue.

16

You say this is different because of that prologue.

17

that prologue has just as much force if the States take

18

away the militia's arms as if the Federal Government

19

does.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

But

I -- I think that few people

21

today would say -- and in fact few people in 1868 would

22

say that the concern to protect the State militias is

23

something that's so fundamental or essential to a

24

concept of ordered liberty or central to our system that

25

it has to be --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, suppose it is.

2

MR. FELDMAN:

3

5

you are saying that -- let's make up an imaginary

6

importance of ordered liberty chart, and we give it to

7

James Madison and the other framers.

insofar as that right to bear arms is important for

the purpose of maintaining the militia, it's high on

Insofar as the right to bear

And if that's what they'd say, it's

14

conceivable that part of this amendment would go through

15

and be incorporated; namely, that part which would

16

prevent a law that would disarm people to the extent

17

they couldn't form militias.

18

disarm people to the extent that they couldn't shoot

19

burglars, that would not be incorporated.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

But that part which would

It -- that would be -- that

21

would be possible, but another -- another way to look at

22

it is that the question that the Court had -- the Court

23

has never answered the question, is this implicit in the

24

concept of ordered liberty or should this be

25

incorporated under any other test?

44
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if we took the

approach that --

3

MR. FELDMAN:

By just --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we took the approach

5

that Justice Breyer outlined, would -- why would we not do

6

the same thing with respect to all the applications of all

7

of the amendments that up to this point have been regarded

8

as being completely incorporated, along with all of our

9

decisions?

So why would we not look at all of our

10

decisions under the First Amendment and the Fourth

11

Amendment and the Fifth Amendment and the Sixth

12

Amendment, and rank all of those interpretations on some

13

scale of ordered liberty?

14

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I don't think -- I don't

15

think the Court would.

16

to Justice Breyer was, we understand that the Second

17

Amendment is in the Constitution and binds the Federal

18

Government, but it has always been understood, from 1868

19

on, that before an amendment applies to the States, you

20

need something more than just finding that it's in the

21

Constitution, and --

22

And what I was really responding

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, to get back to

23

Justice Breyer's point, which I'm not sure you answered,

24

is your theory that you simply -- it's not a question of

25

is it in or is it out?

But you're saying, well, what is

45
Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I -- actually my -- excuse

me.

it's out, because all that shows is the framers certainly

had --

reasons.

I'm trying to get

15

you to take a position on whether or not you want us to

16

not only pick and choose among which amendments are part

17

of our abstract notion of ordered liberty, or if you

18

want us also to take amendments that might be in and

refine them and shave them off a little bit and say,

isn't.

I think the framers had

reasons to put everything in the Constitution that they

than whether they put it in the Constitution.

prologue; it's clear -- it's clear from the opinion in

not the primary reason why people today are arguing that

has to be applied against the States.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Feldman, our

selective incorporation doctrine under the Due Process

10

Clause does suggest that there are some rights that were

11

fundamental enough to be incorporated and some that are

12

fundamental, but not fundamental enough to be

13

incorporated.

We've drawn a line.

Is it the ordered liberty concept alone in

14
15

our jurisprudence that you are relying upon, or is it

16

any other articulation of our incorporation doctrine

17

that supports your view?

18

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that's the underlying

19

standard, but the Court has certainly looked at our

20

history and our traditions in answering this question,

21

and I think they are relevant in this area, as they were

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

about -- about how fundamental it is generally?
MR. FELDMAN:

I -- what the Court actually said

22

in Heller was that there were two States at the time, in

23

1791, that had a firearms right, and with -- there were

24

possibly two more where the evidence was a little bit

25

more ambiguous.

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

As far as today, it is true that 44 States

2

have some kind of recognition of a right to keep and

3

bear arms.

4

them, at least, two to four -- recognize that only in

5

connection with the militia, and it's really quite

6

different from the right that this Court recognized in

Heller.

8

State constitutions include provisions that really would

7

MR. FELDMAN:

The overwhelming consensus

8

among the State courts in interpreting the wide variety

9

of different types of provisions that they have is that

10

it imposes a reasonable regulation standard that is not

11

violated by banning a particular weapon or a particular

class of weapons, as long as you are allowing some kind

13

of firearm, and that is not the right that this Court -JUSTICE SCALIA:

sorry.

What I'm saying is that the right that is

embodied in the wide variety of different State

5

constitutions -- the overwhelming consensus is that what

6

the States have determined as a result of their own

7

processes and in light of their own conditions is that

8

you can't ban all kinds of firearms, but you can ban

9

some kinds of firearms.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's fine.

And that is -- and the kinds

of firearms that have traditionally been banned --

Right.

Well -- and the

15

kinds of firearms that have traditionally been banned by

16

the States and that actually the period around the time

17

of the Fourteenth Amendment is a good period to look.

18

At or around that time, there are numerous States that

19

had regulations barring the carrying and even that go up

20

to the point of possession of pistols and Bowie knives,

21

which are not firearms, but are also arms under the

22

Second Amendment, and so on.

may be perfectly valid today, or -- if the Court

And they were

Now, those were responding to local

4

conditions at the time, and generally, the history of

5

firearms regulation, because of the risk that firearms

6

pose, has been that in this country, it has been widely

7

recognized that in many places it's appropriate to carry

firearms.

14

that has worked through the political process in those

jurisdictions.

16

another distinction between the Second Amendment and

17

some of the other amendments that have been

18

19

incorporating the other amendments and for applying them

against the States has been that there is a concern

about a discrete minority or a highly unpopular view

process.

the zone of ordered liberty for their people.

And those

2

things would be apparently impermissible under Heller.

3

But even more than that, Heller construed

4

the Second Amendment's "bear" -- the word "bear," "to

5

keep and bear arms" -- to mean the same thing as "carry"

6

in this Court's case in Muscarello, much later.

7

carry -- generally to carry.

8
9

And to

Many -- there's a long history of
regulation of not just concealed carry, as the Court did

10

recognize in Heller, but of banning open carry

11

in a variety of jurisdictions.

12

someplace that is -- it has a particular problem; it's a

13

city or something like that.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Again, generally, it's

Do you think there is

15

existing authority with reference to other provisions of

16

the Bill of Rights that would allow us to incorporate

17

just the core of Heller with respect to the States?

18

Just the core of the Second Amendment with respect to

19

the States, along the lines to this question Justice

20

Stevens was asking earlier?

21
22

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I think that there would

be --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

case do we look to for that proposition?

25

MR. FELDMAN:

And if so, what's -- what

I think really this -- I

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cannot offhand think of a case that would lead you to

2

that -- would lead to that.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

If you look to Justice

4

Harlan's dissent in Griswold, where he says the

5

Fourteenth Amendment stands on its own bottom and it can

6

be either more or less than the provisions of the Bill of

7

Rights, and there's no reason in the world why this

8

Court could not adopt the same position here and say:

9

Insofar it's incorporated, it applies only within the

10
11

home.

The Court had ample precedent for that.
MR. FELDMAN:

And actually the other point I

12

make is if you approach it from the other point of view,

13

the case has not been made here -- it hasn't even been

14

brought -- that the City of Chicago is denying people

15

the -- the right to have any kind of firearm or the

16

right to have any kind of reasonable means of

17

self-defense.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

Is it

19

the position of the City of Chicago that we should rely

20

on Justice Harlan's dissent in Griswold?

21

MR. FELDMAN:

No.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then your

23

answer to Justice Stevens is no, you're not going to

24

follow that approach, right?

25

MR. FELDMAN:

No, what I would say is that

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

--

what I would say is that if the Court -- what I was

2

saying is that if the Court approaches it from the

3

standpoint of perhaps if there is -- if the Court

4

chooses in an appropriate case to recognize a

5

fundamental right to self-defense, it would then raise

6

those kinds of questions.

7

case that they are being denied any right to

8

self-defense or any reasonable right to exercise

9

self-defense because of a jurisdiction's firearms

And someone could make the

10

regulations; the Court could address that.

11

claim that has been made in this case; that's not a

12

claim that could be made in this case because --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

15

of Rights.

That's not a

See, the right to keep and
It's right there in the Bill

Where do you find the right to self-defense?

16

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you want us to

18

impose that one on the States but not -- not the

19

explicit guarantee of the right to keep and bear arms.

20

That seems very strange.

21

MR. FELDMAN:

No, actually I -- I don't want

22

to impose that on the States.

I think it's very

23

unlikely that the Court would ever be called upon to,

24

because our history for the last 200 years -- 220 years

25

had been of reasonable State and local regulation of

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

firearms that responds to local conditions, to local

2

threats of violence, and so on that occur.

3

see any reason to think that there will be a

4

jurisdiction that would try to sufficiently ban firearms

5

that people wouldn't have a reasonable means of

6

self-defense.

The District of Columbia

That's what Heller said.
MR. FELDMAN:

Well, the District of Columbia

10

in any event is controlled by Second Amendment as it --

11

as it's written.

12

That's not the question in this case.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you be happy if we

13

incorporated it and said reasonable regulation is part

14

of the incorporation?

15

And how do we do that?

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, there is the reasonable

16

regulation standard.

There's an article by Professor

17

Winkler that we cite in our brief, that goes very

18

extensively through the ways that State courts have

19

dealt with their own rights to keep and bear arms and

20

have adopted, really by overwhelming consensus, that

21

kind of a reasonable regulation standard, which

22

generally recognizes --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

Heller allowed for reasonable regulation.

25

MR. FELDMAN:

I thought that Heller --

Excuse me.

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the Heller

2

decision allowed for reasonable regulation, and it gave a

3

few examples, as Justice Scalia mentioned.

4

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

Well, it's just our

5

view would be that what Chicago has done here, which is

6

permit you to have a -- permit you to have long guns but

7

ban handguns, is the kind of regulation that throughout

8

our history jurisdictions in their own -- that are most

9

familiar with their own particular needs, their own

10

particular problems, and in a position to balance the --

11

the need for self-defense with the risks to the use of

12

firearms -- for violence, for accidental death, and for

13

suicide -- that the City of Chicago has come up with

14

something that is well within our tradition.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And --

What you're urging is

16

really a mixed blessing for gun control advocates.

17

the extent we sever the Federal guarantee from what the

18

States are obliged to comport with, we encourage a

19

stricter Federal Second Amendment, one that forbids all

20

sorts of regulations that the Federal Government might

21

otherwise be allowed to do, because it doesn't matter --

22

the States can take care of it.

23

I mean, you know, if -- if you sever the

24

two, you're encouraging a broader prohibition at the

25

Federal level, and that's what -- Heller was very

60
Alderson Reporting Company

To

Official

1

careful not to impose such a broad prohibition

2

precisely because it realized that -- that this is a

3

national problem.

4

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I think that, if I may --

5

that the restriction that the Second Amendment imposes

6

on the Federal Government should be and is controlled by

7

what the meaning of that Second Amendment was in 1791.

8

It shouldn't vary one way or the other with whether

9

there's incorporation against the States.

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN GURA

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15

MR. GURA:

Sure.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Counsel, at the -- at the

17

very outset of your argument, Justice Sotomayor asked the

18

question which, as I understood it, essentially said what

19

are examples of privileges and immunities that are being

20

denied by the States that -- which denial would be

21

remedied by following your proposal to overrule the

22

Slaughter-House case?

23

And let's leave the Second Amendment out.

24

Let's assume the Second Amendment is a wash; it's either

25

going to be incorporated or not going to be incorporated

61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the same -- to the same extent under either the Privileges

2

or Immunities Clause or the Due Process Clause.

3

the Due Process -- the Second Amendment out of it, what

4

privileges and immunities are now being denied citizens

5

of -- of the United States?

6

MR. GURA:

Leaving

Well, apart from the Second

7

Amendment right, which is being denied to people in the

8

United States by Chicago at least, there are other

9

rights -- other rights enumerated in the first eight

10

amendments that were thought to be the personal guarantees

11

as well as certain unenumerated rights which were

12

understood to be part of --

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
those?

The jury trial in civil cases?

15

MR. GURA:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What are examples of

The jury trial -And grand jury.

What

else?
MR. GURA:

There's not much left, Your

19

Honor.

20

Rights that have not been held incorporated under due

21

process, which informs us that perhaps we should have

22

the Second Amendment incorporated.

23

to treat it any differently.

24

unenumerated rights that perhaps are not being --

25

Those are the only two provisions of the Bill of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's no reason

With respect to the

So you are saying that

62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under -- under your view, every State would have to use a

2

grand jury to bring criminal charges; no more information.

3

And that every State would have to have a civil jury, if

4

any party in the case requested it.

5

MR. GURA:

Is that --

Yes -- well, it's not just what

6

we're saying; it's what the framers of the Constitution

7

said.

8

to a jury trial, for example, may not be efficient, but

9

it is free.

10
11
12

And as Justice Scalia noted in Apprendi, the right

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's a criminal case;

that's quite different.
MR. GURA:

That's right.

We're talking

13

about the Grand Jury Clause; we have 28 States right now

14

out of the 50 that allow prosecutors to pursue felony

15

charges without indictment by a grand jury, but the

16

other 22 States do require it.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
up your time.

Well, I'm -- we're using

But --

19

MR. GURA:

Sure.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- do you want me to leave

21

the bench thinking grand jury indictment and civil trial

22

and jury case -- that's it.

23

these other unenumerated rights?

24
25

MR. GURA:

There's no other -- what are

We can't give a full description

of all unenumerated rights that are going to be

63

protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. GURA:

It doesn't trouble you.

No, it does not, and it shouldn't

4

trouble the Court because the Court addresses due

5

process cases all the time without saying we're --

JUSTICE ALITO:

The right to contract -Isn't that an unenumerated

right?
MR. GURA:

That is literally understood by

12

the framers to be an unenumerated right under the

13

privileged immunities.

14

Civil Rights Act of 1866, that's the very first right

15

that they mentioned as something that people in the South

16

should be enjoying, because they were not allowed to

17

pursue a livelihood.

18

We know that because in the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your approach --

19

your original approach would give judges a lot more

20

power and flexibility in determining what rights they

21

think are a good idea than they have now with the

22

constraints of the Due Process Clause.

23

MR. GURA:

No, Your Honor; our approach

24

might actually provide judges with perhaps no more than

25

what they have now, perhaps even less, because our

64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

approach is rooted in text and history.

2

license for judges to make up unenumerated rights that

3

they believe --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not a

Privileges and

5

immunities give you a lot more flexibility than due

6

process, because it's not limited to procedural --

7

where you don't have to deal with the hurdle that it's

8

limited to procedural by the text.

9

MR. GURA:

Sure.

If I may?

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. GURA:

Thanks.

Yes, you may.

We believe that it's

12

more limited because that -- that text had a specific

13

understanding and that there are guideposts left behind

14

in texts and history that tell us how to apply it, unlike

15

the due process.

16

is that, in 1868, the right to keep and bear arms was

17

understood to be a privilege or immunity of citizenship,

18

and if the Court is considering watering down the Second

19

Amendment, perhaps it should look to text and history.

But at least we know one thing, which
