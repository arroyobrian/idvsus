CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now on number 01-521, The Republican Party of Minnesota,


5

et al., versus Verna Kelly.

Mr. Bopp.


6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,


7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER


8
9

MR. BOPP:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


Like most states, Minnesota selects its judges


10

through periodic popular elections.

11

speech is severely restricted, the people are denied


12

access to the information they need to make an informed


13

choice.

14

elected officials, Minnesota's Announce Clause, as now


15

interpreted by its supreme court, goes too far resulting


16

in elections without campaigns.


17

And when candidates'


While state court judges are different from other


QUESTION:

Could we find out from you just what


18

the Announce Clause prohibits that isn't already


19

prohibited by the Pledges and Promises Clause, as it's


20

been interpreted?


21

MR. BOPP:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

The Announce


22

Clause prohibits, according the decision of the Eighth


23

Circuit, any general -- allows general discussions of the


24

law, while it prohibits any implying of how a person would


25

rule -- a candidate would rule, on an issue or case before

1

the Court.


2
3

QUESTION:

How does that differ, then, from the


Pledges or Promises Clause?


4

MR. BOPP:

The Pledges and Promises Clause


5

prohibits any pledge or promise that -- other than


6

faithful performance of duties in office.

7

between "announce," the plain language of the clause, and


8

"pledge or promise" -- "announce" is simply making known,


9

is one of the formulations of the Eighth Circuit, or


10

implying; while "pledging or promising" is making a


11

commitment on how you would rule in a future case.


12

QUESTION:

The difference


But you think the Announce Clause,


13

even as interpreted by the Eighth Circuit to be the same


14

as the ABA canon, goes beyond that?


15

MR. BOPP:

Well, Your Honor, there is one aspect


16

of the current 1990 ABA canon that has -- was not


17

discussed by the Ninth Circuit or by the ABA brief.

18

that --


19

QUESTION:

And


And where does that appear in your


20

brief?

Where is the ABA canon we're talking about?

21

is it?

I want to look at it while you're talking about


22

it.


23

MR. BOPP:

Where


I do not have a reference to the ABA


24

canon, Your Honor.

I apologize.

The ABA canon states


25

that a -- the 1990 ABA canon states that a candidate may

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not make statements to commit, or appears to commit in


2

deciding cases, controversies, or issues likely to come


3

before the Court.

4

seem to imply that the 1990 canon was similar, if not the


5

same, as the 1972 canon, they did not discuss the


6

difference between the words "announce" and "commit."


7

While the ABA and the Eighth Circuit


"Commit," if you look in the dictionary, says


8

"pledge."

9

narrow under plain --


10

And, thus, the 1990 canon appears to be more


QUESTION:

Well, the Eighth Circuit did say that


11

it was -- that Minnesota's provision is the same as the


12

ABA canon, right?


13

MR. BOPP:

It did, Your -- it did, Your Honor.


14

QUESTION:

And the ABA canon prohibits


15

candidates, judicial candidates, from making statements


16

that commit or appear to commit a candidate.


17

MR. BOPP:

Yes.


18

QUESTION:

And that looks very much like the


19

Pledge or Promise language.

20

should interpret this.


21

MR. BOPP:

I -- I don't know how we


Well, one of the problems, Your


22

Honor, is that the January 29th opinion of the Minnesota


23

Supreme Court interpreting the Announce Clause adopted the


24

Eighth Circuit opinion and its interpretations.


25

QUESTION:

Right.

5

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

Unfortunately, the Eighth Circuit had


2

conflicting statements about the scope of the


3

interpretation that it was announcing.


4

QUESTION:

Well, you were -- you appear to be


5

arguing, in your brief at least, that the Announce Clause


6

is unconstitutionally vague.


7

MR. BOPP:

Yes, Your Honor.


8

QUESTION:

Is that your argument you're making?


9

MR. BOPP:

Yes, we are.


10

QUESTION:

But did you make that argument below?


11

MR. BOPP:

Yes, we did, as to the interpretation


12

proffered in the district court, adding the words "likely


13

to come before the Court."

14

Honor, is that the Eighth Circuit sua sponte added other


15

glosses to this canon, even though it was not advocated by


16

any of the parties.


17

QUESTION:

18

But where we are now, Your


You didn't include a vagueness


challenge in your petition for certiorari, did you?


19

MR. BOPP:

Yes, we did.


20

QUESTION:

Is it in the question on which we


21
22
23

granted cert, do you think?

MR. BOPP:

No, but it is encompassed within the


violation of the First Amendment that we allege.


24

QUESTION:

But I wouldn't have thought vagueness


25

was a First Amendment issue.

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

Well, in the context of First


2

Amendment protected speech, a -- something that chills


3

First Amendment speech, because of -- it is a vague rule,


4

and therefore does not provide a bright line necessary for


5

the exercise of that speech, that it constitutes a First


6

Amendment violation.


7

QUESTION:

One of the statements of the Eighth


8

Circuit -- and I don't have the citation to the brief; I


9

have the citation to the Federal Third -- 247 F.3d 881. 


10

It says that the Announce Clause applies only to


11

discussion of a candidate's predisposition on issues


12

likely to come before the candidate if elected to office.


13
14
15

MR. BOPP:

That is one of the three


constructions.

QUESTION:

If we could -- would you agree that


16

that's perhaps the narrowest of the three constructions? 


17

I want to find what might be the most likely statement to


18

survive review and then have you discuss that, because I


19

take it that you would not be

20

even that is constitutional.


21

MR. BOPP:

-- you would not agree that


It is not the narrowest, Your Honor,


22

because it uses the word "issue."

23

formulations --


There are other


24

QUESTION:

Yes.


25

MR. BOPP:

-- in the Eighth Circuit case where

7

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they use the word "decide a case," such as on page 45a of


2

the petition -- the petition appendix.

3

candidates from, quote, "implying how they would decide


4

cases," end of quote.

5

appendix to the petition, say that, quote -- that the


6

canon, quote, "applies only to discussions of a


7

candidate's predisposition on issues," as you've quoted,


8

and then finally concludes on page 53 with the statement


9

that it prohibits candidates, quote, "only from publicly


It prevents


And they also, on page 52a of the


10

making known how they would decide issues."

11

conflicting interpretations of --


12

QUESTION:

So we have


Well, let's take the -- let's take


13

the last one.

I take it, if that were the authoritative


14

narrowing constructing that were before us, you would


15

disagree with its constitutionality.


16

MR. BOPP:

Yes, Your Honor.


17

QUESTION:

Would you agree that that would be a


18

constitutional standard if it were part of a code of


19

judicial ethics that applied to the judge after the judge


20

was on the bench?


21

MR. BOPP:

No, and -- but I believe that this


22

canon does apply to judges once they are elected and on


23

the bench.


24
25

QUESTION:

Well, are judges, after they are on


the bench, subject to, all of the same rights that they

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have before they go on the bench, insofar as making public


2

comments?


3

MR. BOPP:

No, they may be limited in a number


4

of different ways, Your Honor, that are necessary to


5

advance compelling interests.


6

QUESTION:

Well, why is it that, if an election


7

is in July, the State can, under your view, not prohibit


8

statements in June before he's elected, but they can


9

prohibit the statements in August, after he's elected?


10

MR. BOPP:

Well, Your Honor, the First Amendment


11

applies -- has its most urgent application in campaigns


12

for election, and it is -- and while both judges and


13

judicial candidates may be limited in their speech, it has


14

never been held that simply announcing your views on a


15

disputed legal or political issue constitutes an


16

indication of partiality such that would justify, for


17

instance, recusal or disqualification.


18

QUESTION:

But I thought you said it would be


19

okay.

Then maybe I didn't understand your answer.

20

thought you said that the kind of limitation that Justice


21

Kennedy referred to would be all right for sitting judges,


22

that you could prohibit sitting judges from letting their


23

views be known on any controversial issues.


24

MR. BOPP:

25

your understanding.


I


Well, then I misspoke, if that was

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

Like the incorporation doctrine or


substantive due process and so forth --


3

MR. BOPP:

Canon 4 --


4

QUESTION:

-- you think you could prohibit


5
6

judges from discussing those matters.

MR. BOPP:

No.

Canon 4 -- and in fact, Canon


7

4(b) of the Minnesota canons encourages judges to propose


8

changes in the substantive and procedural law, even


9

individually.


10

QUESTION:

Sitting judges -- sitting judges run


11

for election.

So whatever rights the contender would have


12

in an election, I assume that the sitting judge who was


13

running for reelection would have those same rights, in


14

your view.


15

MR. BOPP:

We believe that they should.


16

QUESTION:

Because the sitting judge could not


17
18

be restricted, could he or she, in a way?

MR. BOPP:

Well, sitting judges are restricted,


19

for instance, from commenting on pending cases that are


20

pending before them, quite properly.

21

talking about stating general views about the law.


But here we are


22

QUESTION:

So sitting --


23

QUESTION:

You wouldn't object to candidates


24

being prohibited from commenting about particular cases


25

either, would you?

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

No, I would not.


2

QUESTION:

I didn't take your objection to be


3

that you say, you know, that there's a case pending in the


4

courts, if I were appointed, I'll tell you how I would


5

decide that case.

You --


6

MR. BOPP:

We --


7

QUESTION:

-- wouldn't permit that, would you?


8

MR. BOPP:

We believe that that can properly 


QUESTION:

I thought you gave examples, or your


9
10

be --


11

-- one of the briefs gave examples of commenting on


12

specific decisions that had been rendered by the Minnesota


13

Supreme Court, and you said that restraint on that comment


14

was impermissible.


15

MR. BOPP:

Yes.


16

QUESTION:

Am I not right?


17

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

So you're making --


19

QUESTION:

That was a past case.

That is our position.


That was a


20

distinction you're making between past cases and pending


21

cases in the court that are likely to come before you if


22

you're elected.


23

MR. BOPP:

Yes, I -- the First Amendment


24

protects discussion of past cases.

However, the Eighth


25

Circuit opinion only allows discussion of past cases while

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the enforcement authorities, specifically the Office of


2

Lawyers Professional Responsibility, had previously said


3

that you could criticize those opinions.


4

QUESTION:

Well, supposing that -- supposing


5

that Minnesota -- the Minnesota Supreme Court had


6

announced that its Fourth Amendment was more protective


7

than the federal Fourth Amendment and a candidate running


8

for that court saw that several cases, the evidence had


9

been suppressed in Minnesota courts, the defendant was


10

acquitted, so he said, "I think we should go back to the


11

idea that our Fourth Amendment is the same as the federal


12

Fourth Amendment."

13

rule?


Would that be permitted under this


14

MR. BOPP:

Under the Announce Clause?


15

QUESTION:

Under the Announce Clause.


16

MR. BOPP:

Not if it's considered implying how


17
18

you would rule in a future case.

QUESTION:

But do we know that -- do we -- is


19

there any mechanism for getting a clarification?

And the


20

big problem in this case is this is a frontal attack, and


21

so we have no specific examples.

22

think this would fit, and I think that wouldn't fit."

23

there any mechanism in Minnesota for seeking


24

clarification?

25

Court's current rule is, indeed, the ABA's 1990 rule?


And you can say, "I

Is


For example, whether the Minnesota Supreme


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

You can seek a private advisory


2

opinion that is not binding on either the office or the


3

board.

4

suit was filed regarding other matters, and they declined


5

to provide that advice.


And petitioner Wersal sought such an opinion after


6

QUESTION:

Mr. Bopp, I would assume your answer


7

would be that if it's too fuzzy for us to understand what


8

it means in order to rule upon its constitutionality, it's


9

also too fuzzy for a judicial candidate to know what it


10

means in order to conform his conduct to it and,


11

therefore, unconstitutional.


12

MR. BOPP:

Yes, sir, Your Honor, not only to


13

candidates, but this canon binds the family members, the


14

supporters of the candidate.

15

viewed to violate this construction -- this new


16

construction of this rule, then the candidate, him or


17

herself, is subject to discipline or removal from office.


18

QUESTION:

If they say anything that is


Well, I still want to make clear your


19

position.

20

after the judge's election, be disciplined, sanctioned for


21

certain remarks that he could not be sanctioned for before


22

the election.

23
24
25

Your position is -- is that the judge can,


Is that correct?


MR. BOPP:

No, Your Honor, and if I gave you


that impression, I apologize. 

QUESTION:

In other words, the rule --

13

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

I am not --


2

QUESTION:

-- post and pre-election, the 


4

MR. BOPP:

The rule --


5

QUESTION:

-- to speak are the same.


6

MR. BOPP:

The rule is the same.

3

rights --


But I think


7

the point I was making was that once a judge assumes


8

office, there are restrictions on, for instance, his


9

ability to discuss a pending case that is not imposed upon


10

a lawyer that is not involved in the case in any way.


11

QUESTION:

Well, do you claim --


12

MR. BOPP:

So then --


13

QUESTION:

All right.

Then your position is


14

that there is a difference as it applies to pending cases


15

as to which a sitting judge has to -- to which a sitting


16

judge has been assigned.


17

MR. BOPP:

Yes, there are specific ethical 
 --

18

QUESTION:

And --


19

MR. BOPP:

-- canons that apply in that.


20

QUESTION:

And that's all.


21

MR. BOPP:

And that's appropriate --


22

QUESTION:

Now --


23

MR. BOPP:

-- an appropriate limit.


24

QUESTION:

-- are there limits on what the


25

candidate can say?

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

I --


2

QUESTION:

And those are what?


3

MR. BOPP:

It's in the realm of Pledges and


4

Promises.

5

sitting judges or not, and that is that a candidate for


6

judicial office shall not pledge or promise certain


7

results in deciding a particular case or issue in a case


8

without regard to the law or facts of the case.


9

It would apply to candidates whether they're


QUESTION:

Suppose he said, "There are a lot of


10

criminal cases pending," and, to take the Chief Justice's


11

hypothetical, "we've gone too far in interpreting the


12

Fourth Amendment, and I'm going to be more strict."

13

your view --


In


14

MR. BOPP:

I think that's a --


15

QUESTION:

-- that could be prohibited.


16

MR. BOPP:

No, that is allowed, Your Honor,


17

because he's not promising certain results in a particular


18

case.

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

That is, again --

QUESTION:

He says, "I promise when these cases


come before me, this is what I'll do."

MR. BOPP:

Then that is a pledge or promise of


an outcome.

QUESTION:

And in your view, that can be


prohibited.

MR. BOPP:

Yes, because there is a --

1

3

QUESTION:

Well, I'm surprised you take that


MR. BOPP:

Well, Your Honor, there is a public


view.


4

perception of the impartiality of the judiciary that I


5

think properly can be taken into account.


6

QUESTION:

Well --


7

MR. BOPP:

And I think this rule announces a


8

rule that is consistent with the judge's obligation to


9

decide cases in accordance with his or her role.


10

QUESTION:

Well, that's an extremely fine line


11

you're drawing, it seems to me, because I think a moment


12

ago, in response to my question, you said that a candidate


13

would be prohibited, and wrongly prohibited, under your


14

view -- on your view of it and from saying that Minnesota


15

should adopt the federal Fourth Amendment standard rather


16

than the more liberal Fourth Amendment standard that the


17

Supreme Court of Minnesota hypothetically had it.

18

that a candidate ought to be allowed to do that, but he


19

isn't under the Minnesota rule?


20
21

MR. BOPP:

You say


He is not, under the -- well, to the


extent that we know what the Announce Clause means --


22

QUESTION:

Yeah.


23

MR. BOPP:

-- with this conflicting formulations


24

under the Eighth Circuit opinion, talking about cases or


25

issues -- talking about, implying, or making known -- to

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the extent that we know the rule, it would appear that


2

such a statement would be prohibited --


3

QUESTION:

And you --


4

MR. BOPP:

-- because it would imply what he


5
6
7
8
9

would rule in the future.

QUESTION:

And you say that the First Amendment


prohibits that?

MR. BOPP:

No, I'd say the First Amendment


protects talking about prior decisions.


10

QUESTION:

What about --


11

MR. BOPP:

And one of the problems is we're


12

talking about the rule -- the Minnesota rule versus --


13

QUESTION:

Yeah.


14

MR. BOPP:

-- other proposed rules.


15

QUESTION:

But if --


16

QUESTION:

What about comment on a -- by a


17

candidate who is not yet a judge on a case which is then


18

pending before the court?

19

prohibit the candidate from saying, "I've been reading


20

about this case.

21

believe so and so should be convicted, and I think the


22

sentence ought to be the following."

23

consistently with the First Amendment, prohibit that kind


24

of a comment?


25

In your view, can the State


I know what the evidence is, and I


MR. BOPP:

Could the State,


Well, there would seem to be, under

17

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Gentile, more leeway for a lawyer not in a pending case to


2

discuss a pending case.


3

QUESTION:

What's the answer to my question?


4

MR. BOPP:

I think -- I think it could not be


5

prohibited.


6

QUESTION:

In the question that the Chief


7

Justice asked, suppose the judge said, "I pledge and


8

promise that if you elect me, I will vote in every Fourth


9

Amendment case to restore the law to what it was."

That's


10

a pledge and a promise, which I thought your argument


11

started out saying you accept that the pledge or promise


12

is a valid restriction --


13

MR. BOPP:

I do, Your Honor.


14

QUESTION:

-- that you can't go on that to the


15

Announce.

16

suggested, "I think it would be a good idea if the court


17

went back there" -- but if he said, "I pledge and promise


18

that I will vote that way" --


19

MR. BOPP:

So suppose that instead of -- the Chief Justice


That is a classic pledge and promise


20

that I think can be appropriated prohibited under the


21

First Amendment.

QUESTION:

As to issues and not as to particular


24

MR. BOPP:

As both to issues and cases.


25

QUESTION:

So that you -- you can't disable


22
23

cases.

1

yourself from being --


2

MR. BOPP:

Open minded.


3

QUESTION:

-- persuaded by counsel that the


4

views you've held your whole life over the incorporation


5

doctrine, turn out to be wrong.


6

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

And while judges certainly have


7

views, and they announce these views in numerous different


8

ways, if they are binding themselves not to have an open


9

mind and to decide a case in advance, then that is a


10

violation of the oath, and that type of pledge or promise


11

should be and can be prohibited under the First Amendment.


12

QUESTION:

Is this different from that?

That


13

is, I read through the Minnesota Bar Association's brief,


14

the ABA's brief, and portions of the Brennen brief.

15

right?

16

like all ethical rules, is vague, interpreted by

What they say this comes down to is you cannot

you can, and there are two pages of this in the Minnesota

I'm just trying to call that to your mind --

13

And what is wrong


14

with it is that the ABA suggested that "commit" means the


15

same thing as "announce."

16

argument is that "commit" means "pledge," and that, to


17

that extent, the ABA canon is different than the current

Announce Clause.

And what I -- my course of my


In fact, it's --


QUESTION:

All right, so if you're saying the

association are wrong when they say that means commit or

appear to commit, on that view, what should I do with this

MR. BOPP:

You should strike down the Announce

They are not in favor of judicial --

judicial candidate can be subjected to restraints on

13

candidates.


14

MR. BOPP:

I believe that they can, Your Honor,


15

because judges have a dual role.

16

and particularly state court judges making common law, but


17

they also have a duty to decide cases impartially.

That is promising now how to decide a


Well, how does this play out with


23

sitting judges who write opinions saying, "In my view, for

25

There it is for everybody to see.

And presumably in a

MR. BOPP:

Under our rule, it would be allowed.

proposals just like that under these canons.

QUESTION:

Now I don't understand what you say

QUESTION:

But I thought that your position with


2

regard to judicial opinions is -- is that it is perfectly


3

okay for a sitting judge to make known to the public his


4

view on something like the death penalty when he does it


5

in an opinion and, therefore, that can be out there.


6

MR. BOPP:

Yes, it is --


7

QUESTION:

Subject to criticism, indeed.


8

MR. BOPP:

Yes --


9

QUESTION:

But somebody who's running against


10

him in an election cannot let be known what his view is on


11

the death penalty.


12

MR. BOPP:

It is perfectly appropriate for a


13

judge to do that in an opinion or in speeches or a law


14

review article.


15

QUESTION:

In speeches?

You mean the judge


16

could go out and -- a sitting judge can go out and make a


17

speech and say, "In the next death penalty case to come


18

before me, I'm going to vacate.

19

vacate the death penalty.

20

is."


21

MR. BOPP:

I'm going to vote to

2

speeches certainly is less than what he can say in a

judicial opinion in which he says, "I vote to vacate the

mean, there's some line between them.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. GILBERT


12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


13

MR. GILBERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


14

please the Court:

15

try to clarify some of the questions and answers that have


16

been provided as to what the construed rule in Minnesota


17

means.

18

petition appendix, where the Eighth Circuit stated the


19

definitive narrow construction of this rule which says


20

that the rule only prohibits candidates from --


I would like to take the opportunity to


And I refer the Court to page 53a, of the cert

QUESTION:

Whereabouts on the page?


22

MR. GILBERT:

24

candidates from publicly making known how they would


25

decide issues likely to come before them as judges.

The beginning of the second

It only restricts judicial


27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

That


1

is the narrow construction of this Eighth Circuit opinion. 


2

That is the construction that's being applied by the two


3

boards that I represent, and that is the construction that


4

has been incorporated in an authoritative order by the


5

Minnesota Supreme Court.


6

QUESTION:

What about the example I posed to


7

your opponent?

Someone says, "I think the Minnesota


8

Supreme Court's ruling on the Fourth Amendment, the state


9

Fourth Amendment being broader, is wrong, and I -- if you


10

will elect me as a judge, I would try to change that


11

around."


12

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, this is where the


13

record is very clear as to what Mr. Wersal has done.

14

in response to your question, the candidate could


15

criticize a prior decision of a judge, but could not say


16

as to a future case how that candidate would decide the


17

case.

18

And


And that's precisely --

QUESTION:

So let me put that to the test.

If I


19

say, "I think the decision of the Supreme Court of


20

Minnesota two years ago saying that the Fourth Amendment 


21

-- state Fourth Amendment protected more than the federal


22

Fourth Amendment is wrong," he could do that, but he


23

couldn't say, "If you elect me to the Supreme Court, I


24

would carry out my view."


25

MR. GILBERT:

Well, that would be a future case. 

28

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And there's other considerations --


2

QUESTION:

Well, he told me he couldn't even


3

say, "I think that opinion is wrong.

4

position concerning the meaning of the Fourth 


5

Amendment" --


6

MR. GILBERT:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GILBERT:

9

And that is not my


Your Honor --


-- "in Minnesota."

That's not correct, Your Honor. 
 I

refer you to the record in this case and what Mr. Wersal


10

has said in his literature.

11

volume of the Joint Appendix, pages 34 to 38, as well as


12

pages 86 to 91, they contain the actual statements that


13

Mr. Wersal made as part of his campaign.


14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GILBERT:

If you look at the first


What pages?

30 -- let's see -- 34 to 38, and


16

86 to 91.

17

about his judicial philosophy.

18

talk about his judicial philosophy.

19

"I'm a strict constructionist," and he criticized the


20

Minnesota Supreme Court for being a judicial activist. 


21

But more --


22
23

And look what he said.

QUESTION:

First of all, he talked


He has said that he can't

He did.

What does that mean?

He said,


I mean, that's


so fuzzy, that doesn't mean --


24

MR. GILBERT:

25

QUESTION:

Well, but --


-- that doesn't mean anything.
29

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It

doesn't say whether you're going adopt the incorporation

doctrine, whether you believe in substantive due process. 


3

It is totally imprecise.

MR. GILBERT:

QUESTION:

Can they say anything more than


QUESTION:

Can they say anything that has any


meaning?


10

MR. GILBERT:

Absolutely.

11

-- look at what Mr. Wersal --


12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GILBERT:

And what they can do


But what about my example?

Your example, Your Honor, the


14

candidate can, as Mr. Wersal did, criticize a prior


15

decision of the Court.

16

has happened in the Wersal case.

17

cannot do is say that, "If I'm elected, I'm going to


18

overturn that decision."


19
20
21

And


fluff?


8
9

And candidates can say that.

that's the point.


6
7

It's just nothing but fluff.


QUESTION:

And that's very clear from what

What the candidate


Does that dichotomy make any sense at


all?

MR. GILBERT:

Well, it does in the sense, Your


22

Honor, that there's different dynamics involved once a


23

judge is elected and has to overturn a decision that's


24

already precedent in the State of Minnesota.


25

QUESTION:

So a candidate says, "This is the

30

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

worst decision that's come down since Dred Scott, it's a


2

plague on our people, it's an insult to the system, but


3

I'm not telling you how I'll vote."


4

(Laughter.)


5

MR. GILBERT:

6

QUESTION:

Your Honor, that's the point.


It's more than that.

You assert that


7

that does not, within the language that the Supreme Court


8

has adopted, it does not imply how he will vote on that


9

issue at a future date.

10

we've ever done."

11

vote on it?


12

He says, "It's the worst case


That doesn't imply how he's going to


MR. GILBERT:

Well, that might well imply


13

whether he's going to overturn it.

14

can say and what Mr. Wersal said -- if you look at the


15

criticism that he leveled at these decisions of the


16

Minnesota Supreme Court, he said just as you indicated,


17

Justice, that, "These decisions are" --


18
19

QUESTION:

But what the candidate


What are you reading?

Where are you


reading from?


20

MR. GILBERT:

If you look at pages -- page 36,


21

for example, of the -- this is of the Joint Appendix -- he


22

says, on abortion, "The Court ordered the State must use


23

welfare funds to pay for abortion despite state law to the


24

contrary.

25

This is under the topic of "Examples of Judicial


The dissenting judge remarked," et cetera.

1

Activism."

2

38.


3
4

But then he goes into greater detail on page


QUESTION:

But is the statement at page 36 that


you read -- is that proscribable under the State's rule?


5

MR. GILBERT:

No.

And that's the point.

What


6

has happened here, Your Honor, is that there was a


7

complaint filed against Mr. Wersal for all of this


8

campaign material.

9

Board, Marcia Johnson, in an opinion, on pages 20 and 21


And the then-director of the Lawyers


10

of this appendix, said that the statements made by Mr.


11

Wersal are not proscribable.

12

rule is narrowed.


13

And that's even before the


And if you look at page 21, the executive


14

director said specifically that Mr. Wersal can criticize


15

prior decisions of the Court.

16

what the Board on Judicial Standards did in --


And that's consistent with


17

QUESTION:

What do you say --


18

QUESTION:

May he also, at the same time as they


19

criticized the decision, say, "I do not believe in stare


20

decisis"?


21
22
23

MR. GILBERT:

Yes.

He can't, because that 


is --

QUESTION:

Well, then isn't he saying how he's


24

going to rule on the case then?


25

MR. GILBERT:

Well, Your Honor -- it might be,

32

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Your Honor.

2

it's still -- the distinction is --


3
4

People might be able to imply from it, but


QUESTION:

Might be able to imply that I don't


believe in stare decisis and I think this case is wrong.


5

(Laughter.)


6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GILBERT:

Pretty clear, I think.

No, and I understand what you're


8

saying, Your Honor.

The distinction that's made, if you


9

look at all the cases that have dealt with this issue, is


10

a distinction between past cases on one hand and then


11

pending and future cases on another.


12

QUESTION:

As long as you're silent on your


13

views on stare decisis, that's a fine distinction.

14

you do reveal your views on stare decisis, that


15

distinction is meaningless.


16

MR. GILBERT:

Perhaps.

But if


There could be other


17

issues that come up in terms of a case that would be a


18

vehicle to overturn particular decisions -- standing,


19

things of that kind.


20

QUESTION:

So now you're saying there's a


21

distinction between issues and cases.

And I'm saying


22

you're categorically stating your view about a particular


23

issue, as the Chief Justice's example states, and you also


24

categorically state, "I think stare decisis has no place


25

in constitutional adjudication."

Can he do that?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, again, the -- no,


2

under the State's interpretation of the rule.

3

understand your point.

4

what the State is trying to do is protect the integrity of


5

the judiciary at that point.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GILBERT:

8

It is a fine distinction.

But


And to the extent --


This protects its integrity?

Your Honor, we think so.

And the


reason for that is that --

MR. GILBERT:

If I say something about stare

a candidate for that office is somehow restricted from

That's kind of an odd system, designed to what?

incumbent judges, or what?

MR. GILBERT:

No, it's not, Your Honor.

In


5

fact, that is not correct in terms of the effect of that


6

situation.

Appendix, what the executive director of the Lawyers Board


8

has said is that an incumbent judge can criticize the


9

prior decision of that sitting judge.

Again, if you look at page 20 of the Joint

MR. GILBERT:

QUESTION:

You did --

The challenger.

I'm sorry.


-- the challenger, who is not a


18

judge, can criticize the specific decision of the judge


19

who wrote it.


20

MR. GILBERT:

21

QUESTION:

22

That's correct, Your Honor.


So they're equally free at the least


to discuss the specific past cases.

MR. GILBERT:

23

At the least.

And I would submit


24

that the challenger is in a better situation because of

QUESTION:

All right.

Can I ask you this


question --


3

MR. GILBERT:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.


-- because I understand that -- I


5

have two questions, really.

6

-- that you're trying to draw, everyone would concede is a


7

very difficult one to draw, but it is the line that I


8

tried to draw.


9
10

MR. GILBERT:
QUESTION:

One is the line that's being


Yes.


Now, what would happen if, instead of


11

my being in the Senate, I had been in an election


12

campaign, and I was trying to draw this very line between


13

commitments to future cases, specific ones, and general


14

judicial philosophy.

15

said, "Breyer made a mistake.

but I was in good faith.

20

And suppose my opponent, after,


MR. GILBERT:

He didn't get it right,"


What could happen, or would


As a -- I'm sorry, as a sitting


judge, Your Honor?

QUESTION:

Well, I then -- suppose I won.

Fine. 


21

I've won the election.

22

understand is what are the consequences?

23

all, an ethical rule, and ethical rules are often blurry.


24

MR. GILBERT:

25

QUESTION:

My opponent -- what I'm trying to

It is, after


Yes.


And I want to know what would likely

1

happen to a person who makes a mistake in drawing this


2

very fine line, assuming that it's in good faith.


3

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, the Board on Judicial


4

Standards or the Lawyers Board would have jurisdiction


5

with respect to a violation which sounds like a technical


6

violation, as you describe it, and could impose some


7

discipline, but I would suspect that discipline would be


8

very minute, if at all --


9

QUESTION:

Could a state --


10

MR. GILBERT:

11

QUESTION:

12
13
14
15

-- under those circumstances.


-- make a violation of the provisions


you described a criminal offense?

MR. GILBERT:

No, Your Honor.

These are not


criminal statues.

QUESTION:

But could a state do it under the


16

First Amendment?

17

proposition, that can -- a state can impose a civil


18

sanction, but not a criminal sanction?


19
20

Is there any authority you have for the


MR. GILBERT:

I'm not aware of any authority


that would allow a criminal sanction for such a thing.


21

QUESTION:

Can I ask you one other question?


22

QUESTION:

That's not my question.

Is there any


23

authority that a state, under the First Amendment, is free


24

to impose a civil sanction but not a criminal sanction on


25

particular speech?

MR. GILBERT:

I'm not aware of authority to that


effect either, no.

QUESTION:

This is a technical question, but the


4

sentence you started out reading from the Eighth Circuit's


5

opinion is not identical to the ABA canon.

6

if this rule differs from the ABA canon and is stricter,


7

one could say there's a less restrictive alternative,


8

namely the ABA canon.

9

how to deal with that problem.

And obviously


And so I'm quite concerned about

Do I assume that, in fact,


10

Minnesota does mean it's indistinguishable from ABA canon,


11

which is what the ABA says?

12

How do I deal with that?


13

MR. GILBERT:

Or what your opponent says? 


Your Honor, our position is, just


14

as the ABA indicated, that our rule is the functional


15

equivalent of a commitment clause.


16

QUESTION:

The Minnesota Supreme Court turned


17

down the ABA rule, the ABA rule -- we're talking --


18

they're both ABA rules.

19

20

the functional equivalent of the current rule.

21

the Minnesota Supreme Court considered and turned down


22

that rule.

23

makes it very fuzzy.

says, "We agree with the Eighth Circuit."

25

telling us that the Eighth Circuit has adopted,

essentially, the ABA's current rule.

MR. GILBERT:

Yes, Your Honor, and that is the


3

case, and you are right.

4

discussion of adoption of the commit clause by the


5

Minnesota Supreme Court.

6

There has been a lot that has evolved over the last seven


7

years, Your Honor, and the Minnesota Supreme Court has


8

made the decision in its January 29th, 2002, order that


9

this construction by the Eighth Circuit is the


10

Back in 1995, there was


It did not occur at that time. 


construction that they are going to place on their clause.


11

QUESTION:

Whatever that is.


12

MR. GILBERT:

Well, this construction, Your


13

Honor, is, for all practical purposes, identical to the


14

commitment clause.

And --


15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GILBERT:

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Gilbert, may I ask --

Yes.


-- a question based on what you said


18

about stare decisis?

You say -- have said consistently


19

you can discuss your judicial philosophy.

20

wouldn't one's position on stare decisis fall under


21

judicial philosophy?


22

MR. GILBERT:

23

QUESTION:

Well, why


I think it would, Your Honor.


So that -- so you're changing back


24

then, because you said a while ago that stare decisis --


25

if you said, "I think that decision about the Fourth

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Amendment was wrong, and I don't believe in stare


2

decisis," you said you couldn't put those two together.


3

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, you can put them


4

together.

5

conclude from that what the ramifications would be if that


6

particular candidate came to the Supreme Court, for


7

example, on what the candidate would do with respect to


8

that decision -- whether the candidate would overturn or


9

not.


10
11

I think the question was, could someone then


QUESTION:

And your answer was it would imply


how he's going to vote and, therefore, would not be --


12

MR. GILBERT:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GILBERT:

Again --


-- would not be acceptable, right?

Yes, Your Honor, with the


15

distinction being to protect the integrity of the


16

judiciary.


17

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask about that.

You


18

know, in evaluating whether a state has demonstrated the


19

kind of significant interest necessary to abridge speech,


20

it seems to me we have to look at the entirety of the


21

state law to see what interest it's pursuing.


22

I, frankly, am absolutely befuddled by the fact


23

that Minnesota wants its judges elected -- that's its


24

constitutional provision -- and then enacts statutory


25

provisions that are intended to prevent the electorate

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

from knowing, even by implication, how these candidates


2

are going to behave when they get on the bench.

3

to me a total contradiction.

4

like a legislative attempt to simply repeal Minnesota's


5

constitutional provision providing for the election of


6

judges, which is a neat and easy way to get rid of it if


7

you can't do it by plebiscite.


8
9

It seems


And, indeed, it looks to me


Why does it make any sense to vote for a judge

in an election, a judge who is not able, even by


10

implication, to tell the electorate what kind of a judge


11

he would be?


12

MR. GILBERT:

Well, but, Your Honor, that's the


13

fallacy in that statement, is that a candidate can tell


14

the electorate what kind of candidate they are.

15

thing that the candidate cannot say -- it's a very limited


16

restriction -- and that is, how I am going to decide a


17

future case.


18

QUESTION:

Not a particular -- well, no, not


19

just a future case, a future issue -- any, not a


20

particular case, but any issue --

-- how I will vote on the Fourth

doctrine.

I can understand your saying, he shall not

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

should do that.

2

he's been wrong.

3

the Fourth Amendment should be just like the federal


4

Fourth Amendment, and stare decisis in constitutional


5

matters is not a doctrine that I think is very strong --


6

it seems to me you ought to be able to say that.


7

He should be able to be persuaded that

But to say that my current view is that


MR. GILBERT:

And they can say that.

I think


8

the difference of opinion we have here is whether they can


9

go the extra step and just say, "And I would try to


10

overturn the decision if I'm elected."


11

QUESTION:

Well, if that --


12

MR. GILBERT:

13

QUESTION:

I have to --


-- if that indicates a


14

disqualification or a lack of temperament for the bench,


15

the voters can decide that.

16

judges can come out and say, "We have a candidate running


17

who doesn't have the right judicial temperament," and the


18

voters decide.

19

The bar association and the


That's the way elections work.


MR. GILBERT:

They can do that, but I submit to


20

you, what happens if that judge wins?

21

that judge wins and the litigants come before that judge


22

who has prejudged that case?


23

QUESTION:

24
25

What happens if


Well, I suppose the people have said


what kind of judges they want.

MR. GILBERT:

Oh, and it's all of a sudden

42

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

majority opinion?


2

QUESTION:

Why is that any worse than litigants


3

who come before a judge who's already sitting and who has


4

said in a prior opinion that he thinks the Fourth


5

Amendment in Minnesota should be interpreted the same way


6

the federal Fourth Amendment is?

7

MR. GILBERT:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GILBERT:

Why --


Because in --


-- is that any different?

Because in a prior opinion, due


10

process was accorded, because the judge actually heard the


11

argument of the litigants, heard the facts and the


12

applicable law.


13

QUESTION:

You mean a judge can't have an


14

opinion without hearing from all sides and going in briefs


15

and so forth?


16

MR. GILBERT:

17

QUESTION:

18

Absolutely.


Well, what if -- even if he gives a


speech, does he have to first have this sort of vetting?


19

MR. GILBERT:

Not at all, Your Honor.

The only


20

-- again, the limited restriction here is that the -- a


21

judge cannot -- I'm sorry -- a judicial candidate cannot


22

prejudge a future case, cannot say, "I think this statute


23

over here is unconstitutional," or, "I think, in consumer


24

fraud cases, that anybody who wins is entitled to punitive


25

damages."

Alderson Reporting Company

Minnesota to decide whether a judge has a judicial

temperament.

You wish us to depart from the usual

MR. GILBERT:

6

QUESTION:

Again --


-- that we do not allow the State to

8

information.


9

MR. GILBERT:

QUESTION:

Well --


Maybe we should know about this


11

judge's temperament.

issues, we say, this is not the kind of judge we want.

elections if the last is a significant State interest.

MR. GILBERT:

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, that's --


To the degree that you're making it a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

significant State interest here.

2

whether it is a significant State interest, because you


3

have a constitution that says, "We're going to have


4

judicial elections."

5

but as long as that's in your constitution, I find it hard


6

to believe that it is a significant State interest of


7

Minnesota to prevent elections from being informed.


8
9

See, I just question


Now, that may be a very bad idea,


MR. GILBERT:

Well, again, Your Honor, we're


trying to weigh the different interests.

I am sure you


10

wouldn't suggest that the State doesn't have a compelling


11

interest in the integrity of the judiciary, and that is a


12

competing interest that is being weighed here, and that


13

results in the commitment clause that the ABA has adopted


14

and the parallel provision that has been construed


15

narrowly by the Eighth Circuit, which, again, only forbids


16

or prohibits a judge saying, "I'm going to decide this


17

particular issue this way in the future."


18

QUESTION:

So you're saying the public doesn't


19

know enough in order to determine whether a judge has the


20

requisite qualifications for office.


21

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, I'm not saying that


22

the public knows or doesn't know.

The concern is what


23

happens if that candidate is elected, and then you or any


24

other litigant comes before that candidate, who is now a


25

judge, and tries to litigate the issue that the judge has

MR. GILBERT:

I am surprised to hear that, in

light of the testimony that is in our brief and other

briefs --

I actually found that when they


21

approached a particular case about how you were going to


22

decide in the future, both the senators -- in my


23

experience, since it only concerns me -- would not press


24

the issue of how you would decide a particular case.

QUESTION:

I was -- my reference was to a

particular issue.

4

A particular issue.


MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, cases are made up of


5

issues.

6

are important in and of themselves.


7

And sometimes a case only has one issue.

QUESTION:

Issues


Mr. Gilbert, do you think we should


8

draw any distinction, or whether it would be reasonable


9

for us to draw any distinction, between the application of


10

the rule to the candidates themselves and the application


11

of the rule to all of these ancillary individuals around


12

them -- their associates, their families?

13

that we say that the rule passes muster with respect to


14

the candidate.

15

candidate's spouse?

What's the justification for muzzling the

I mean, I know, in fact, what --


16

MR. GILBERT:

17

QUESTION:

Yeah.


-- it is, because we figure, you


18

know, that's how you get the message out.

a more difficult First Amendment hurdle?


20

Let's assume


MR. GILBERT:

But do we have


Your Honor, I don't think so, not


21

at all.

I think it's really a misnomer to talk about


22

muzzling, which is what the petitioners have indicated.


23

QUESTION:

24

MR. GILBERT:

25

Let's say "limiting."

Well, it's not even that.

What


the rule does is ask the judicial candidate to encourage

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

close family members not to effectively circumvent the


2

rule by announcing views that they might be aware of that


3

the judicial candidate would support.


4
5

QUESTION:

But if the family member says, "Well,


I'm going to tell anyway."

MR. GILBERT:

there's no penalty.

MR. GILBERT:

10

QUESTION:

"I'm going to tell anyway" --


But the --

There's no --


But there could be.

Do I understand


11

that there would be an inquiry in that event as to whether


12

the candidate had, indeed, encouraged the family member to


13

be quiet?


14

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, the standard is


15

"knowingly permit."

16

judicial candidate would actually have to be the actor


17

behind those actions.


18

QUESTION:

So, in other words, some -- the


All right, but I want to know, in


19

practical terms, what happens.

The spouse makes a

statement -- any one of the statements that have been


21

mentioned here, except as suggesting prejudgment of a


22

case.

complaint would be filed against the candidate, and I

Your Honor, I'd assume a complaint


MR. GILBERT:

Well, Your Honor, it's a very


difficult standard to satisfy, "knowingly permit."

Well, maybe it's difficult to


15

satisfy.

16

burden on the individuals involved is.


I'm just trying to get a sense of what the


17

MR. GILBERT:

QUESTION:

Well --


And I assume that there could be a


19

complaint, simply based on the emphatic statement of the


20

spouse.

show, in that event, that he did not knowingly encourage,


22

or does the State have to show -- or the prosecutor or


23

whoever it is -- that he knowingly did encourage.

complaints where they don't have sufficient evidence to

think there's even a basis for the complaint.


13

QUESTION:

Well, would they have sufficient


14

evidence in the event that a spouse made an emphatic


15

statement saying, "His view is," or "Her view is"?


16
17
18

MR. GILBERT:

What


Counsel says is that the new vagueness issues that he's

raising are a consequence of the opinion which your

MR. GILBERT:

Well, we -- Your Honor, you're

petitioners have done is, they have refused to acknowledge


16

that narrow construction.

17

that the Minnesota Supreme Court has now authoritatively

adopted that as a state court construction.

of the matter is, as well, that the Eighth Circuit already

whether it's, it unconstitutionally impinges on the


2

freedom of speech.

3

of speech is that you cannot -- you cannot chill speech by


4

having a prohibition that is not clear.

5

that this is a separate issue from the First Amendment

issue at all.


And one of the principles of freedom

MR. GILBERT:

8

QUESTION:

9

I don't think


Well, they have not --


We have lots of cases like that,


about chilling speech because it's not clear what the


10

coverage of the prohibition is.


11

MR. GILBERT:

Your Honor, in their petition,


12

though, they have not made those kinds of arguments


13

specifically as to --


14
15
16

QUESTION:

They certainly did in the reply


brief.

MR. GILBERT:

They have in the reply brief, but


17

not in the petition, which was the question that was asked


18

previously.

19

court has been really clear in the Broadrick v. Oklahoma


20

case, for example, and the Colton v. Kentucky case, that


21

sometimes rules and statutes -- and, frankly, all the


22

time, rules and statutes are not conducive to mathematical


23

precision, that there are going to be, as the Court has


24

said, germs of uncertainty in how these laws are applied. 


25

And these laws are going to be applied based upon facts


And as to vagueness, I should say that this

and circumstances.

2

it's really significant that we don't have any facts and


3

circumstances as to what Mr. Wersal wants to say.


4

QUESTION:

And in this particular case, I think


Well, I think you could set up a


5

system where you get advisory opinions, but I don't know


6

that we've ever allowed that to be done in the First


7

Amendment area.


8

MR. GILBERT:

9

QUESTION:

Oh --


"Please may I say this?"

You know,


10

you submit what you want to say, and somebody tells you,


11

"Yeah, okay.

12

contrary to our approach to the First Amendment.


13

You can say that."

MR. GILBERT:

That's certainly


Well, Your Honor, I don't -- Your

Honor, first of all, I'm not a proponent of what

consideration in upholding the Hatch Act against

constitutional attack, because there was the ability of


18

people who had questions about the application of the


19

statute to actually go to an advisory board and get an

opinion.

But in Letter Carriers, that was a critical

parties to this case do provide advisory opinions, and

they provide them on short notice, as well.

it is a consideration in terms of if there is a close

to how that particular situation would be interpreted,

they can go to the boards and ask that question.

from the board?

MR. GILBERT:

If somebody wants to give a speech in a

opinions over the phone, Your Honor, on very short order,


10

and they could do it in a matter of hours or days,


11

depending upon what the needs are.


12

QUESTION:

Mr. Gilbert, you brought out that


13

this is not just a question of the candidate informing the


14

voter, that behind all of this is a litigant who's going


15

to be in a future case.

16

Suppose, to take an example that Mr. Bopp provided in his


17

brief, the judge -- or the candidate is campaigning "Tough


18

on Drunk Driving."

19

come before this judge, now elected, and I say, I want him


20

to recuse, he said he's tough on drunk driving.


How does it work in Minnesota? 


And then I'm a drunk driver, and I

MR. GILBERT:

22

QUESTION:

Are you asking in the --


Would there be, under Minnesota law,


23

a grounds to say, "I don't want that judge, because he's


24

announced in the election that he's tough on drunk


25

driving"?

One distinction I would like to make here -- oh,

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

No, I don't think so, Your Honor,

Mr. Bopp,


you have three minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


9

MR. BOPP:

Your Honor, I don't think this is a


10

matter of mathematical precision.

11

itself, states two different formulations of the rule. 


12

They say, quote, "It is clear that the clause applies to


13

statements about how they would decide, quote, issues, end


14

of quote, on pages 1 and 47.

15

quote, "clear," end of quote, that the announced clause


16

applies to statements about cases.

17

12 and 37.

18

State's own formulation of its scope.


19

The State brief,


And then they say it is,


And that is on pages


The rule is not even clear in terms of the

20

pages 111 through 123, announcing your views also includes

22

speeches.

23

up the board or the office for an oral opinion which is


24

not binding on them about whether or not they can answer a


25

question on the radio.


It is hardly a remedy for a candidate to call

And, finally, it is undisputed that the people


2

of Minnesota want an impartial judiciary.

Governor Arnie


3

Carlson, at Joint Appendix page 247, said -- who's a


4

State's witness -- that people do not want judges who are


5

pre-committed.

statements, who would appear to be partial, risk defeat at

the polls in Minnesota.

Amendment guarantees that they should receive that

information, which the Announce Clause both prohibits and

It is, therefore, unconstitutional.
