ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. ALSOBROOK, JR.


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

In Kikkonen v. Guardian Life, this Court


12

hypothesized the very situation that we have before you


13

this morning because here we have a nationwide class


14

action settlement where the court specifically by judgment


15

retained jurisdiction to manage the settlement as well as


16

enforce it.

17

dismissal of this case.

18

to dismiss the case, as the Eleventh Circuit pointed out


19

and as the district court pointed out, his efforts were


20

thwarted and the case was not dismissed.


21

A critical part of that settlement was the


QUESTION:

However, when class counsel went


Mr. Alsobrook, I see you've changed


22

the question presented from the time in your certiorari


23

petition to your opening brief.

24

presented, when we granted, referred to 28 U.S.C., section


25

1441, and now you have dropped your reference to that. 


And the question


3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Does that mean you're abandoning reliance on 1441 or


2

simply broadening the question? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

3

No, sir.

We -- we're saying


4

that under 1441 that because the district court retained


5

jurisdiction, that that was original jurisdiction to


6

remove the matter, and that actually, Your Honor, when we


7

removed this, they -- the majority of circuit courts of


8

appeals, namely the second, sixth, seventh, and eighth,


9

had said that the proper vehicle to remove this was the


10

All Writs Act.

And that is what we are claiming today, as


11

well as 28 U.S.C. 1367 ancillary jurisdiction, and we have


12

set that out in our brief. 

QUESTION:

13

But you have no right to remove under


14

1441 because there wasn't complete diversity in the


15

Louisiana suit.

Isn't that right? 


16

MR. ALSOBROOK:

17

QUESTION:

18

That is correct. 


So you can't rely on 1441 and that's


conceded.

MR. ALSOBROOK:

19

We -- we can -- our reliance on


20

1441 was based on the fact that the Alabama court retained


21

original jurisdiction and --


22

QUESTION:

But that's not -- nothing in 41 rests


23

on that.

24

original jurisdiction, and you don't have that.


25

It has to be a case that would qualify for


MR. ALSOBROOK:

Yes, Your Honor, but we -- we


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

construed that as being a venue rather than a -- a --


2

because the Alabama court had original jurisdiction.


3

And certainly under 1651 --


4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ALSOBROOK:

What did you construe as being venue?

The -- the fact that we had to


6

take it to a Federal court in the district where the State


7

court suit lay, and then it was immediately transferred to


8

the -- to the Alabama court. 


9

QUESTION:

Yes, you -- you can't remove a case


10

to a Federal court outside of the district in which the


11

State court sat, is my understanding. 


12

MR. ALSOBROOK:

13

We took -- we took our road map from Agent


14

Orange Product Liability.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ALSOBROOK:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ALSOBROOK:

20
21

There, there was a --


What court are you talking about?

We're talking about the Second


Circuit.  And --

QUESTION:

Initially the Eastern District of New


York, Judge Weinstein's --

MR. ALSOBROOK:

23

QUESTION:

25

There they had a Texas --


Who is they? 


22

24

That's right, Your Honor.


Yes. 


-- order, which was in no way based


on 1441.  It was based on 1651.

MR. ALSOBROOK:

But, Your Honor, also in that


5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

case was the case of Ryan, and in Ryan, it was brought by


2

to class members in the State court in Texas.

3

removed to the Federal court in Texas and then transferred


4

to the Eastern District of New York.

5

road map for getting this case to -- back to Alabama.

QUESTION:

6

And it was


And that was our


But that was all done under the All


7

Writs Act or what they thought was the authority granted


8

by 1651.

MR. ALSOBROOK:

9

Yes, and we also, Your Honor --


10

in our removal petition, we pled the All Writs Act, as


11

well as ancillary jurisdiction under 1367.

QUESTION:

12

Well, what is your theory under the


13

All Writs Act?

14

comes under the All Writs Act? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

15
16

We contend that -- that in order


for the Court --

QUESTION:

17
18

Is your theory that removal is itself --


Can't you answer the question yes or


no?


19

MR. ALSOBROOK:

20

QUESTION:

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Yes.


I thought the All Writs Act required


21

the existence of some sort of a common law writ like


22

certiorari or prohibition or injunction or something like


23

that.

24

removal. 


25

There -- there never was a common law writ of


MR. ALSOBROOK:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

But the jurisprudence, particularly the Agent

Orange case --

QUESTION:

3
4

Well, but can you cite any of our


cases that support you in this respect? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

5

Well, I can cite the New York


6

Telephone case where the Court said that -- that removal


7

was -- not removal, but a writ under the All Writs Act was


8

-- was proper to avoid the frustration of judgment, and


9

that was -- that was certainly the situation here.

QUESTION:

10

But -- but that was a different --


11

that was an existing writ.

12

effect, that removal is -- is itself a writ.

13

don't see how the cases support you there.


14

MR. ALSOBROOK:

15

QUESTION:

16

I agree with that, Your Honor. 


Do you agree that the All Writs Act


MR. ALSOBROOK:

Yes, ma'am.

Yes, Your Honor, by


the --

QUESTION:

19
20

And I simply


is not a source of original jurisdiction? 


17
18

Here -- here you're saying, in


Why -- why then didn't you try to get


an injunction in the district court in Alabama?

MR. ALSOBROOK:

21

There were two reasons, Justice


22

O'Connor.

First is that an injunction would not dismiss


23

the case.

An injunction would enjoin the -- the State


24

court suit from going forward. 


25

QUESTION:

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ALSOBROOK:

And we would have had -- our


2

client would have had to carry this as a liability on


3

their books ad infinitum. 


4

9

QUESTION:

Well, couldn't the injunction have


ordered the party to dismiss the case?

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Yes, they did -- they could,


Your Honor, and --

QUESTION:

But then why -- why wouldn't that be


sufficient? 


10

MR. ALSOBROOK:

11

QUESTION:

I suppose it would have been.


But if that's so, then why don't --


12

why are we trying to read into 1441 language that isn't


13

there and read requirements out of 1651, requirements that


14

are there, when there was another way, totally consistent


15

with the words, the statute, everything else, that you


16

could have achieved any legitimate objective that you had?


17

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Well, Justice Breyer, at the


18

time that we did this, as I said earlier, there was -- the


19

majority of Federal circuit courts said that the proper


20

vehicle was to remove the case and get it before the court


21

where -- that had issued the judgment.

22

number of class action settlements that are going on,


23

there must be some kind of way by which a Federal court


24

who issues a judgment can enforce that judgment across


25

State lines.


Today with the


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

There is.

Isn't that just in your


2

answer to Justice O'Connor and Justice Kennedy?

3

provided the way. 


4

MR. ALSOBROOK:

5

QUESTION:

You


Yes. 


The -- the only loose end, it seems


6

to me, that -- that you have left, after your answers to


7

Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, is the problem you say your


8

client would have in carrying liability on the books until


9

the second action was somehow finally terminated.

But


10

isn't the answer to that that once you had gotten either


11

the injunction or simply the -- the order to the parties


12

under the retained jurisdiction, you then could have gone


13

into court in the second suit and said, they cannot


14

prosecute the suit?

15

please dismiss it.

16

dismissal and wouldn't that have taken the -- the


17

liability off the book? 


18

MR. ALSOBROOK:

19

QUESTION:

It has been enjoined.

Therefore,


Wouldn't you have gotten your


I don't know, Your Honor. 


Well, I -- I guess why wouldn't that


20

have been the appropriate course? 


21

MR. ALSOBROOK:

I -- I presume that the State


22

court under those circumstances would dismiss it, but we


23

don't know that as a matter of fact.


24
25

QUESTION:

I -- I was thinking about different


writs, and you've researched this more thoroughly than I,


9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I suspect.

I thought the closest thing here was a writ of


2

certiorari.

This is like a writ of certiorari, but a writ


3

of certiorari is from a superior court to an inferior


4

court.

5

State courts and Federal courts. 


6

MR. ALSOBROOK:

7

And I -- I don't think that's the way we treat


And another reason --

QUESTION:

8
9

That is correct, Your Honor. 


And -- and -- which -- and so that


the absence of that kind of -- of writ indicates to me


10

that the safer course, the more prudent course is to rely


11

on the standard equitable remedies such as injunction that


12

we've been discussing. 


13

MR. ALSOBROOK:

14

QUESTION:

15

Except that a lot of other lawyers


had -- had relied on the course that you relied on.


16

MR. ALSOBROOK:

17

QUESTION:

18

That's correct, and a lot of --


You were following what had been a


successful course in the past. 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

19
20

That is correct, Your Honor. 


And not only that, a lot of


judges. 


21

QUESTION:

Well, to be sure. 


22

MR. ALSOBROOK:

And so there were a plethora of


23

district court cases that allowed the removal under the


24

All Writs Act and took jurisdiction where they had


25

jurisdiction originally under the cases of NAACP, under


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Agent Orange case, and the Sixth and Seventh Circuit


2

cases. 


3

QUESTION:

Were there any cases under the


4

relitigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act that


5

used that device, the antisuit injunction, to accomplish


6

the same thing? 


7

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Well, Your Honor, no.

The Tenth


8

Circuit had ruled that the -- that the All Writs Act could


9

not be used in this -- in the method that we used it.

10

are not unmindful of Rivet v. Regions, but we -- our


11

situation there -- our situation in this case is much


12

different --


13

QUESTION:

We


But that was -- that was a question


14

of fighting it out in the State court, and it's not the


15

antisuit injunction that we're discussing now.

16

it's an -- preclusion is an affirmative defense.

17

raise it in the State court that prior Federal litigation


18

precludes this case. 


19

Rivet said

You can


The other way to go is to ask the court that


20

entered the judgment, the class action judgment, the


21

nationwide class action, to enjoin the party who was


22

supposed to have settled the claim from proceeding in the


23

-- in the original case when part of the bargain was to


24

dismiss it.

25

attempt that route.


So I -- I'm just curious why you didn't


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ALSOBROOK:

We didn't attempt that, Your


2

Honor, because the majority of the circuits at the time


3

approved the All Writs Act as the vehicle with which to


4

remove the case and to get it back before the district


5

court. 

Additionally, we felt that it -- State courts


6
7

have cases removed all the time to Federal court.

8

thought it would be less onerous to the State court judge


9

to have it removed rather than being enjoined by a Federal


10

And we


court.

QUESTION:

11

I don't understand that because right


12

-- built right into the removal provision is a command


13

that the State court shall proceed no further.

14

removal petition acts as -- as a -- an injunction against


15

the State court proceeding further. 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

16

So the


Well, the removal petition --


17

actually the court loses jurisdiction of it at that time


18

because they -- it -- it is removed to -- to the Federal


19

court.

20

that it was less onerous and there was some jurisprudence


21

or some dicta and some legal writing that indicated that


22

it would be less onerous to the State court judge to have


23

it removed rather than have it enjoined.


24
25

And there again, Justice Ginsburg, the -- we felt


QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

Looking at


the language of the All Writs Act, which authorizes all


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

courts established by act of Congress to issue writs


2

necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective


3

jurisdictions and so forth. 

Now, in this case, you removed from the Federal


4
5

-- to the Federal court in Louisiana in order to protect


6

the jurisdiction of the Federal court in Alabama.


7

MR. ALSOBROOK:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, sir. 


How do you square that with the


language, respective jurisdictions? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

10

Well, Your Honor, there again we


11

had to rely on Agent Orange.


12

QUESTION:

13
14

You don't rely on the statute,


though.

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Well, we relied on the statute


15

because it says in the aid of their respective


16

jurisdiction, and --


17

QUESTION:

Don't you think that refers to the


18

court to which removal would take -- would occur?

19

here it's the Louisiana Federal court, not the Alabama


20

Federal court.


21

MR. ALSOBROOK:

And


Yes, sir, and we -- it was our


22

position that there -- there respective jurisdiction


23

related to the Alabama court.

24

QUESTION:

25

That is our position. 


Even though you removed to the


Louisiana court.


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ALSOBROOK:

We had to, Your Honor.

That --


2

under 1441, we had no alternative but to remove it.

3

couldn't have removed it from the Louisiana court to the


4

Alabama court because 1441 by venue says that it has to go


5

to the Federal district court in the -- of the district


6

where the case lies. 

QUESTION:

7

We


But 1441 wasn't available to you.

8

as long as something new is being created in -- under


9

1651, why not say that -- that the court that has


10

jurisdiction over the class action can issue orders to


11

stop inconsistent litigation? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

12

That could be done under the


13

Anti-Injunction Act, Your Honor.

14

that.

15

There's no doubt about


And as -- as --

QUESTION:

But do -- as far as -- you're


16

creating a removal that doesn't exist by statute.

17

-- why not go all the way and say, under the All Writs


18

Act, we can remove to the -- from the Louisiana State


19

court to the Alabama court?

20

1441 is inapplicable? 


21

So


MR. ALSOBROOK:

So not


Why touch base with 1441 when


Because 14 -- we didn't know of


22

any other vehicle that would allow us to remove it from


23

Louisiana to Alabama.

24

allow us to remove it across State lines or even out of


25

the district.

Even the All Writs Act would not


Certainly if this case had been brought in


14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Mobile, then we wouldn't be here today because the -- the


2

court in Mobile would have authority to -- to remove it to


3

that district.

4

lines.

5

set out for us in Agent Orange.


But it was brought -- brought across State


And again, we followed the road map that had been


QUESTION:

6

But you still have problems even if


7

it were to the Middle District of Alabama, because you


8

don't have complete diversity in the Louisiana action. 


9

Therefore, 1441 doesn't apply.

You would still have to


10

use your All Writs Act theory even if the case were


11

pending -- if the Federal and State court were in the same


12

State.


13

MR. ALSOBROOK:

Well, Your Honor, we feel that


14

-- that under -- under the hypothet set out in Kikkonen


15

that the Alabama court would have had jurisdiction to take


16

that case.


17

QUESTION:

Mr. Alsobrook, what is -- what is


18

this writ called?

19

supposed to have asked somebody in the Justice Department


20

to get him a writ of fixitatis. 


21

(Laughter.) 


22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

I mean, Lyndon Johnson is -- is once


What -- what is this writ called?

A


writ of removal? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

This could be a -- well, there


is no writ for this, Judge -- Justice.

There isn't any


15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

writ for this. 

QUESTION:

2
3

Well -- well, then how can you do it


under the All Writs Act? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

4

Because in other cases, the All


5

Writs Act has been used to -- to remove cases to avoid a


6

State court case from thwarting a Federal judgment.

QUESTION:

7

Certiorari I guess is the closest. 


8

Historically you could have sent certiorari -- a court to


9

any other court and to any administrative agency.

10

that would be the closest historically.
MR. ALSOBROOK:

11
12

I guess


Would it?


Well, I think Justice Kennedy


brought that up and --

QUESTION:

13

Yes.

As we've come to limit it, it's


14

-- it's higher to lower, but if you go back into history,


15

it wasn't, I don't think.

16

saying, look, you were in a situation where you thought


17

that the signer of the stipulation was flat out violating


18

it, and you didn't know what to do, so you read the


19

precedent, and there was precedent that suggested, under


20

the lower court precedent, that this was the right thing


21

to do.

I mean, has it come down to


So you did it. 


22

MR. ALSOBROOK:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, sir. 


Okay.

Now, if you turn out to be


24

wrong, what should we do next, assuming you're right about


25

the stipulation?

They just flat-out wouldn't follow it.


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And -- and suppose you were wrong about the route.

2

you any suggestion for us as to what to do?

3

guess we'd have to dismiss -- order this case dismissed


4

without prejudice to your going to the Alabama court and


5

-- and asking them to enjoin?

6

about what we should do --


7

MR. ALSOBROOK:

8

QUESTION:

9

Have


Do we -- I


Or what is your suggestion


Well --


-- if you're right on the merits of


this thing? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

10

If we're right on the merits,


11

Your Honor, what I suggest you should do is reverse the


12

Eleventh Circuit. 

QUESTION:

13

I don't mean the merits of the


14

procedural issue.

Suppose that you're wrong about that,


15

hypothetically, but you're right about your basic


16

instinct, that they signed a piece of paper saying, we


17

promise to dismiss this case in the State court and then


18

they didn't.

19

of this.

They just didn't do it.

That was your view


Right? 


20

MR. ALSOBROOK:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, sir. 


All right.

So have you any


22

suggestion for us about how we might help you achieve that


23

ultimate objective, and by us, I don't mean this Court


24

particularly.

25

way that you get that objective if you're right. 


I mean the law.

The law should provide a

MR. ALSOBROOK:

I would -- the alternative I


2

would suggest is to remand the matter to the Federal


3

district court in Mobile with instructions for them to


4

file an injunction or a contempt proceeding against the


5

party --

QUESTION:

6

But that would be up to you to -- I


7

mean, the court doesn't initiate an injunction.

8

have to ask for it.

9

it.

You'd


And I assume you would be free to do


If all this Court would decide, if it decided against


10

you, was that the All Writs Act is not available for this


11

purpose, that would leave you as though you had never


12

pursued that route and you could pursue another. 


13

There's something curious about this case, and


14

maybe you can -- you can help me understand it.

15

plaintiff's class counsel in Price went into the Louisiana


16

court and said, Louisiana court, drop that case, dismiss


17

that case, the defense counsel wasn't there. 


18

MR. ALSOBROOK:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ALSOBROOK:

When the


No. 


Why not? 

Your Honor, this is not in the


21

record but I was that counsel, and I had talked with the


22

class counsel days before, and he assured me that he would


23

take care of it and there would be no problem.

24

anticipate this happening because the language of the


25

stipulation of settlement, which the respondent signed,


We didn't


18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was so specific that we couldn't imagine that the State


2

court judge would not dismiss it on the motion of class


3

counsel.

QUESTION:

So you were relying on plaintiff's


counsel --

Yes, ma'am. 


-- to do -- to do that job for you


and felt you didn't need to appear in the State court. 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

He actually told us we didn't


have to appear, that he would take care of it.

QUESTION:

Mr. Alsobrook, if we disagree with


12

you and reverse the -- and affirm the Eleventh Circuit, we


13

would be affirming a decision that says in its conclusion,


14

we accordingly vacate the district court's order


15

dismissing Henson and remand with instructions for the


16

court to remand Henson to Louisiana State court.


17

We do not, however -- this is part of what it


18

said -- we do not, however, imply that the district court


19

may not by injunction force Henson's dismissal.

20

know, we wouldn't have to say that -- that our decision


21

here was without prejudice.

22

Circuit was said to be without prejudice.

23

be able to, as far as the Eleventh Circuit opinion is


24

concerned, get -- get the injunction.

MR. ALSOBROOK:

So, you

I wonder why it wasn't -- wasn't more

efficient for you to seek the injunction instead of coming

Well --


I guess -- I guess --

-- Justice Scalia --


-- your answer is better to have two


bites at the apple than one.
MR. ALSOBROOK:
QUESTION:

Right? 


Yes, sir.

And --


Even if you lose here, you can then


seek the injunction. 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

And also because the majority of


13

the circuits have approved the procedures that we followed


14

in this case.

15

Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth.

16
17
18

You have the Second Circuit; you have the


QUESTION:

And --


Well, what was the reasoning of those


circuits? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

The reasoning of those circuits


19

were that they had retained jurisdiction to enforce their


20

judgments.

21

NAACP I, the court remanded the case to the circuit court. 


22

NAACP II, the court said that because they had retained


23

jurisdiction in an order, that they could go forward under


24

the All Writs Act. 


25

QUESTION:

For example, if you take NAACP II -- rather,


And what -- did they specify what

MR. ALSOBROOK:

you a little hesitant to rely.

MR. ALSOBROOK:

9

No, sir. 


Well, we had to rely on what the


courts were telling us, Your Honor -- I mean, Mr. Chief

Justice. 

QUESTION:

Were those cases in which there were


two -- two different districts involved? 

MR. ALSOBROOK:

The Agent Orange case, there


were two different districts, yes. 


15

QUESTION:

But all of them were not, were they?

MR. ALSOBROOK:

QUESTION:

It seems to me it's quite different if you're

Weren't some of them -- yes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN


7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. BEDERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

The All Writs Act may not be relied upon to


11

remove an otherwise unremovable case.

12

province to define the limits of removal, and chief of


13

these is the requirement of original jurisdiction in


14

Federal court. 


15

QUESTION:

It is Congress's


Mr. Bederman, I just asked your --


16

your friend to -- to explain why he was up here.

17

you up here?

18

you know, don't you think that an injunction will issue?


19

Why are


Because even if you win, the case will --


MR. BEDERMAN:

Very likely Mr. Alsobrook will


20

apply, as the Eleventh Circuit invited them to, for an


21

injunction.

22

under this Court's decision in Parsons Steel, the State


23

court has yet to issue a conclusive ruling about


24

preclusive effect.

25

We are, by no means, conceding the -- the substantive


Such an injunction could proceed because


And therefore, they're at liberty to.

merits of the injunction motion whether they would have a


2

substantial likelihood of success on the merits, but we


3

would certainly agree that they have the ability to file


4

an injunction immediately. 


5

7

QUESTION:

Why -- why -- okay.

What -- what is


at issue on the merits? 

MR. BEDERMAN:

The issue on the merits would be


8

presumably the proper construction of the settlement


9

agreement --


10

QUESTION:

Of the settlement agreement? 


11

MR. BEDERMAN:

That's right.

And, of course,


12

whether an injunction, narrowly tailored to the parties,


13

would, as -- as the Justices have already indicated, be


14

properly addressed to the parties to order dismissal of


15

the case.

QUESTION:

So you -- you would -- you


would contest the injunction just as you're --

We would contest the merits of

MR. BEDERMAN:

2

QUESTION:

3

That's right, Justice Breyer.


So I'm just curious what the defense


would be. 

MR. BEDERMAN:

4

The only defense that -- that I


5

could imagine is the ambiguity in that provision, as you


6

were reading, at 38a of the joint appendix, that the


7

concern about whether including any and all claims,


8

including without any limitation any claims defined


9

herein.

And what has not been made clear is that there


10

were subsequent amendments to the stipulation, which made


11

clear that certain classes of claims were excluded.

QUESTION:

Well, I guess that isn't before us


14

QUESTION:

It's not before us. 


15

QUESTION:

-- is it? 


16

MR. BEDERMAN:

12
13

here --


Certainly not, Justice O'Connor. 


17

What's before this Court is what is the proper procedural


18

mechanism to be used here. 

QUESTION:

19
20

And several circuits have allowed the


All Writs Act to be used in this fashion, do you think? 

MR. BEDERMAN:

21

In this fashion?

Yes, Justice


22

O'Connor.

That clearly this is what I would characterize


23

as a newfangled procedural device that was launched by the


24

Second Circuit after the Yonkers and Agent Orange cases;


25

that it has developed, as I think Mr. Alsobrook fairly
