ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ELWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Neutral laws requiring official recusal for

12

conflict of interest do not abridge free speech because

13

a legislator's vote, however expressive, is not

protected speech.

15

exercise of State power that he wields as an incident of

16

public office.

17

It is, rather, a legally binding

The Nevada Supreme Court concluded that

18

Respondent did have a free speech right to vote, and

19

that overrode the Nevada recusal statute.

20

reasons, that holding was error.

21

For four

First, since the earliest days of the

22

Republic recusal rules have been understood to serve

23

important interests unrelated to any views a legislator

24

may want to express, by requiring disqualification when

25

circumstances indicate that private interests may have

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- the -- the case

is -- is presented to us with briefs that seem to pass

in the night.

5

was a right to vote that's protected under the First

6

Amendment, and -- which is what the Nevada court held

7

and you're quite correct to address it.

8

Respondent says:

effect on -- on protected speech.

10

Your emphasis was on whether or not there

But the

Well, this interest has a chilling
I think we have to

reach both parts of that argument.

11

Do you -- DO you agree with me?

12

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that the Court could

13

simply address what the Nevada Supreme Court did and

14

tell it whether it got it right or got it wrong, whether

15

there's a speech interest, and what -- whether that is

16

subject to strict scrutiny or not.

17

But I think that, even though that argument

18

I don't think was raised or passed on below, that the

19

Court would have discretion to address that.

20

would give additional guidance to the Nevada Supreme

21

Court.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think it

Well, if we -- if we say

23

that intermediate scrutiny is the test, even under that

24

test, certainly under that test, the regulation cannot

25

chill speech any more than necessary to fulfill the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

governmental interests, even under the intermediate

2

standard.

3

MR. ELWOOD:

I -­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and it just seems

5

to me it's difficult for it to just address the standard

6

of proof without deciding the case.

7

Maybe we can just answer the -- the question that was

8

certified and -- and send it back, if -- if you prevail.

9

I'm not sure.

10

MR. ELWOOD:

Maybe you're right.

I think -- I think you're

11

right, Justice Kennedy, that it would provide more

12

guidance to the Nevada Supreme Court.

13

pretty narrow reversal and remand, assuming that the

14

Court merely reached the speech question.

15

It would be a

But on the associational question, I think

16

it's important to emphasize from the outset that I think

17

this would have a negligible effect on association,

18

because it simply would not apply all that frequently.

19

In order for the recusal statute to apply, two

20

circumstances have to be simultaneously met.

21

there has to be a qualifying relationship which is close

22

and ongoing, and simultaneously it must have the -- it

23

must -- the third party must have a private, usually

24

pecuniary, interest before that same legislator.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

First,

As I understand the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

objection, it's not to the recusal rules in general, but

2

it's to the vagueness of this particular one.

3

understand it, there's no concern about the specific

4

categories that were mentioned, like family member or

5

employer.

6

MR. ELWOOD:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is correct, Justice -­

8

can you have recusal rules.

9

you can.

10

As I

So we're dealing not with
Everybody believes, yes,

It's the degree of specificity.
MR. ELWOOD:

Well, that was the basis of the

11

holding of the Nevada Supreme Court, was that those

12

implicated speech rights and that all of them would be

13

subject to strict scrutiny.

14

all be agreed that the court below applied fundamentally

15

too high a level of scrutiny.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So from the outset, we may

But the -- the objection

17

to the statute on the grounds that it's vague doesn't go

18

away simply because intermediate scrutiny applies, does

19

it, assuming intermediate scrutiny?

20

MR. ELWOOD:

No, but I think that the -- our

21

response to the vagueness argument is that Respondent

22

concedes that the four categories for members of your

23

households, relatives, employers, and business

24

relationships are clear.

25

brief.

He says that on page 2 of his

So the question is whether the "substantially
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

similar" language gums up the works, essentially.

2

Now, "substantially similar" is a statutory

3

phrase that has had to have been used by every State

4

legislature in the country and by Congress.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But not in this context.

6

And you don't disagree that -- I forgot which brief told

7

us that there's no State has a similar catch-all.

8
9

MR. ELWOOD:

Well, first, I would disagree

with the characterization of it as a catch-all, because

10

it only sweeps in relationships that are substantially

11

similar.

12

true catch-all, which sweeps in -- it applies "whenever

13

it could appear to a reasonable person having knowledge

14

of the relevant circumstances that the covered

15

individual's judgment is impaired because of either a

16

personal or business relationship not covered under

17

subsection A or B above," which lists the covered

18

relationships, "or a transaction or activity engaged in

19

by the covered individual."

20

But Seattle, for example, has a, what is a

So while Nevada may be the only statute that

21

applies "substantially similar" to these four

22

categories, it is not alone in that structure.

23

think more importantly, it is not anywhere close to

24

alone in its breadth.

25

think, if anything, broader:

And I

The New Jersey statute is I
"A direct or indirect

7

financial or personal involvement."

2

State statutes which apply to business associates.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

There are numerous

Well, I found this statute

4

very difficult to understand, but maybe you can explain

5

what's -- what I found a bit puzzling.

6

talks about a commitment in a private capacity to the

7

interests of others.

8
9

The statute

Now, I take it that that commitment doesn't
have to be something contractual.

When you're talking

10

about relatives, that would assume -- that that would

11

include emotional commitments to the relatives who are

12

listed; is that correct?

13

MR. ELWOOD:

I think it would include the

14

things -- the same things that are covered by

15

ordinary -- every other recusal statute, which is very

16

close personal relationships and relationships that give

17

rise to a financial interest on the -- for the public

18

official.

19

And we're not talking about, you know -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Not -- not a financial

20

interest of the public official, a financial interest of

21

the -- the relative or the person who is substantially

22

similar to a relative.

23

MR. ELWOOD:

Or is that wrong?
Well, I think that in the case

24

of the relative, yes, it's the financial interest of the

25

relative, and that's why the very close personal
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

relationship.

2

members of the household, who are presumably part of the

3

same economic unit, and for employers, in whom the

4

officer has obviously a very close financial interest

5

and they're tied together, and for business

6

relationships, all of those are to get at the financial

7

interests of the officer, not of the third party.

8
9

But all of the other relationships for

JUSTICE ALITO:

Maybe if I give you an

example it will be clearer.

Let's take somebody who is

10

within the third degree of consanguinity.

11

include second cousins?

12

MR. ELWOOD:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

So that would

Yes.
Okay.

Now, let's say a

14

public officer is considering something that would

15

affect everybody's property taxes in town or a measure

16

that would affect the benefits or the wages of everybody

17

who works for the town.

18

cousin whose property taxes would be affected or works

19

for the town, and the second cousin's wages or benefits

20

would be affected.

21

recuse?

22

And this official has a second

Now, would that person have to

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that the -- it would

23

depend on a couple of things.

First of all, it is a

24

covered relationship, the second cousin would be a

25

covered relationship.

And -- and I think the interest
9


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there I think would be the subject of some debate

2

whether it is a private interest because it is a broadly

3

shared interest.

4

taxes might increase, it would be a private interest.

5

But I suppose because his property

There is still the question of whether a

6

reasonable person under those circumstances would view

7

his -- his judgment, his independence of judgment, as

8

being materially affected.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if I were a public

10

officer I would find it very difficult to figure out

11

whether a reasonable person would think that an effect

12

on my second cousin's property taxes would require -­

13

would materially affect my judgment.

14

worse than that because of the "substantially similar."

15

So the public officer not only has to think about second

16

cousins; the person has to think about everybody who is

17

like a second cousin to him or her.

18

you -- how you go about that.

19

MR. ELWOOD:

But it's even

I have no idea how

Well, the way that that has

20

been defined, and this appears -- this is not just a

21

Nevada Commission on Ethics interpretation.

22

what the legislature understood it to mean, if you look

23

at the legislative history, when they added the statute

24

in 1999.

25

"substantially similar" relationships were relationships

This is

What they were looking for by adding the

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that were substantially similar to household and

2

substantially similar to family.

3

there is not the fact that you have a genetic similarity

4

makes you more likely to see things their way, but that

5

families are presumed to be among your closest

6

relationships.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what is at issue

Suppose that you spent

8

your life in the civil rights movement or the right to

9

bear arms movement or one or the other sides of the

10

abortion debate, and these are your acquaintances, this

11

is your -- it's been one of your principal activities,

12

not for pay, but just because of your civic commitment.

13

And then you are elected to the legislature and under

14

this Nevada statute that controls, must you recuse

15

whenever an officer of that association has -- is paid?

16

MR. ELWOOD:

No, Your Honor.

Because, to

17

begin with, a personal relationship, it only covers the

18

very closest personal relationships.

19

intimate and closest relationships on earth would be

20

covered.

The last case that

recusal was in 1999 before the statute was amended.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Elwood, for me at least

3

we've -- we've jumped way ahead.

4

concerned about the vagueness as I am about the

5

proposition that ethical rules adopted by legislatures

6

for voting are subject to review by this Court or by any

7

court under the First Amendment.

8

I'm aware of that we've ever had which makes such an

9

allegation or -- I'm not even aware of any other case in

aspect of this case.

which does not make me happy.

2

MR. ELWOOD:

It is true.

And in addition to

3

that, to expand it even more, apply it even more

4

broadly, with the exception of essentially the D.C.

5

Circuit's opinion in Clarke v. United States, this is

6

the first opinion I'm aware of where anyone has even

held that there is a First Amendment interest in any

8

sort of expressive official act.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You modified your

10

answer to Justice Scalia by saying you're not aware of

11

any case that applied the First Amendment to rules of

12

general -- neutral rules of general applicability, I

13

think.

14

doesn't matter, does it?

15

type of rules that you say are not -- are okay and are

16

not if the First Amendment doesn't apply at all?

17
18
19

But if the First Amendment doesn't apply, that

MR. ELWOOD:

You can't limit your -- the

I'm not sure I understand your

question, Justice, but I think -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if the First

20

Amendment doesn't apply to this type of activity, then

21

you would have no First Amendment objection to biased

22

rules of specific applicability.

23

MR. ELWOOD:

Oh, absolutely we would,

24

because I think R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul speech that

25

is subject to prescription can't be regulated in a
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

viewpoint-based manner.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

3

position was that this wasn't speech protected by the

4

First Amendment.

5

MR. ELWOOD:

But even speech that is not

6

protected by the First Amendment, such as fighting words

7

in R.A.V., can't be regulated in a viewpoint-based

8

manner.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So someone can

10

challenge one of these rules on the grounds that it's

11

not neutral, that it applies in a disproportionate way

12

to particular members of the legislature?

13

MR. ELWOOD:

I think they could challenge it

14

in a way -- alleging that it was viewpoint-based if it

15

were only applied to Democrats or Republicans.

16

don't think that if it were an otherwise normally

17

applicable rule that it would be subject to challenge on

18

that basis.

19

But I

That is the relevance of neutrality.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm not sure why you should

20

concede even that, Mr. Elwood.

21

if this is not proscribable speech of the kind that

22

R.A.V. was talking about, why should we care about the

23

viewpoint based doctrine that's arisen in First

24

Amendment law?

25

MR. ELWOOD:

If this is just conduct,

Well, in the event, Justice
15


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Kagan, that is how I interpret R.A.V., that it would not

2

be an available option to have a viewpoint-based recusal

3

statute that affected things differently depending on

4

viewpoint.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think that

6

the rules in the House of Representatives allocating

7

time on the floor or committee membership are neutral?

8

They're biased in favor of whichever party happens to be

9

in the majority.

10

MR. ELWOOD:

They are -- I think that

11

they're -- I think that they're neutrally applicable.

12

don't know that they would -- I am not aware of them

MR. ELWOOD:

MR. ELWOOD:

It's a

But in any event, all the Court

7

even needs to get to is whether laws of neutral

8

applicability would be covered, because that's all this

9

statute is.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

This statute doesn't apply

11

just to voting.

It says that the public officer shall

12

not vote upon or advocate the passage or failure of the

13

message.

14

MR. ELWOOD:

But that is essentially -­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Advocating the passage or

16

failure of the message is surely speech in the ordinary

17

understanding of the concept.

18

MR. ELWOOD:

But that is to essentially

19

complete the disqualification just as under Thomas

20

Jefferson's recusal rule.

21

under Jefferson's rule, you were out of it.

22

the purpose of the statute.

13

MR. ELWOOD:

Isn't that correct?

I -- if it is reviewed -- I

14

mean, it depends on the test you use.

15

that O'Brien, which is a test that some of the amici

16

have proposed, is an appropriate standard, because even

JUSTICE BREYER:

questions that were raised, is this too vague or is it

not?

So which is it?

MR. ELWOOD:

Justice Breyer, I don't think

21

we have to get as far as the position that Justice Kagan

obvious that the ayes don't have it, do we review that?

9

Why aren't you willing to accept that?

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that that represents -­

Is there any greater

11

violation of the principles of democracy than counting

MR. ELWOOD:

Yet that matter is

may well be that that would support an even -- a

JUSTICE ALITO:

In several recent cases the

4

Court has taken pains to make the point that it is not

5

going to recognize any new categories of unprotected

6

speech.

7

now in response to some questions is that there is this

8

new category of unprotected speech, which is advocacy of

9

the passage of legislation when a recusal statute comes

10
11

But the argument that you seem to be endorsing

into play.
MR. ELWOOD:

But I think that if there's any

12

law that has a better claim to -- to be added to that

13

category, it's one that would be consistent with a law

14

or a rule that was adopted by the first Congress 7 days

15

after they first achieved a quorum.

16

the people who were the people who proposed and framed

17

the First Amendment, and they never indicated that they

18

thought any sort of personal First Amendment right was

19

implicated by recusal rules, either by them or Thomas

20

Jefferson's rule, which was not even a rule adopted by

21

the whole House.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, those were

Counsel, just to clarify

23

this issue, because I don't know that I've heard you

24

state it explicitly, the second part of this recusal

25

statute that bars the advocacy of a measure in which
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there's an interest prohibited by the statute, it is

2

your position that's advocacy in the legislative body?

3

MR. ELWOOD:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5
6

Absolutely.
So it's only limited to

getting up on the floor and talking about that?
MR. ELWOOD:

That is absolutely correct.

We

7

view it as basically completing the disqualification and

8

saying you are just not, you cannot act as a legislature

9

in deciding whether this bill will be passed.

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That person can still go

outside and give all the press releases they want?

12

MR. ELWOOD:

Absolutely, they can.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What do we do with cases

14

like Miller v. Town of Hull and Colson v. Grohman that

15

have recognized retaliation claims because of speeches

16

given during the casting of a vote?

17

still be viable if we decide that there is no First

18

Amendment right in voting?

19

MR. ELWOOD:

Would those cases

I -- I think they would be

20

viable under the -- the way we are framing it, which is

21

that basically if it's a law of general applicability

22

that you could still bring a claim of retaliation,

23

which -- those kind of claims are problematic for other

24

reasons because there's a lot of what would be called

25

retaliation that is itself protected by the First
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Amendment.

2

But if you're talking about a official who

3

is a civil service employee, assuming you need to even

4

get there because they have their own civil service

5

rights to be there, they would still have the claim that

6

it was based on viewpoint-based discrimination, and

7

under the rule we are proposing -- or the rule that we

8

are willing to abide by, certainly -- R.A.V. v.

9

St. Paul would protect those people for a retaliation

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Carrigan -- if -- if we

12

did not review any of these ethical rules applicable to

13

a legislature, at least where the rule is adopted by the

14

legislative body itself, as -- as opposed to being

15

imposed upon it by -- by some other body, there is the

16

protection that all of the legislators are subject to

17

it.

18

it's vague for everybody else as well.

2

MR. ELWOOD:

That is true, and this law

3

applied -- for the better part of 30 years, it applied

4

to every legislator in the State of Nevada.

5

to members of the legislature.

discriminatory manner; it turned out, you go back and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA E. ROSENKRANZ

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19
20
21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The core problem with this statute which the

22

Court has been grappling with is this:

23

unelected commission has arrogated to itself essentially

24

the right to invalidate an election result and to do it

25

in a way that treats core political association as
26

Alderson Reporting Company

an elect -- an

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

corrupting.

2

to tell an elected official that he cannot cast the vote

3

that he ran on and was elected to cast, they have to do

4

it clearly, they have to do it prospectively, and they

5

have to do it for an important reason.

6

If the police of political purity are going

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the

7

legislature adopts a rule that says from now on we're

8

going to require a four-fifths majority for a bill to

9

pass, that lowers the effectiveness of the speech of

10

someone in the minority, and you can challenge that on

11

First Amendment grounds?

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I think not, Your Honor,

13

because that is a way of organizing the institution that

14

applies equally to all members of the institution.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So does this.

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, this will -- this

17

will single out individuals at any particular moment in

18

time who are specifically isolated and told that

19

that particular individual cannot vote.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How is that different

21

from the minority people in the Chief Justice's?

22

only affects them when they're in the minority?

23
24
25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

It

Well, yes, Your Honor.

I think -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it only affects

27

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

somebody if they fall within the strictures of the

2

statute?

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And my -- my point is

4

simply that this takes one particular legislator and

5

says, you cannot vote.

6

fine in certain circumstances, but not when the effect

7

is to tell someone that the rationale, the reason that

8

you are being isolated is because you associated with

9

someone politically who helped you win an election.

10

And those rules are completely

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rosenkranz, you are

11

not -- is it right that you are not challenging any part

12

of this statute except the one that -- that says

13

"substantially similar"?

14

constitutional objection to; is that right?

15

The rest you have no

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That is correct, Justice

16

Ginsburg.

17

use of that "substantially similar" provision to expand

18

the statute to -- to relationships that bear no relation

19

to the actual text of the statute.

20

And more precisely, we are challenging the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Rosenkranz, is -- is

21

the vote of a judge in a case like the vote of a

22

legislator?

23

subject to ethical rules which -- which prohibit their

24

participating if there would be, quote, "an appearance

25

of impropriety."

Is -- is that speech?

Because judges are

If there's anything vaguer than that I
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can't imagine what it might be.

2

that stuff?

Can I get out of all

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Here's -- here's what you

5

can get out of, Your Honor.

You can get out of -- for

6

example, if you are, in addition to being a judge, a law

7

professor at a State university and that university

8

fires you because of an opinion that you issued, that

9

opinion is speech.

10

That vote has speech aspects to it.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are you answering my

11

question?

I want to know whether I can get out of this

12

appearance of impropriety stuff.

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

The answer is no.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why?

15

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

For two reasons.

One is

16

that judges are just plain different from legislators.

17

Judges are supposed to bring no political loyalties at

18

all to them when they are sitting on the bench.

19

Legislators are actually not only allowed to, but

20

expected, to bring political loyalties when they -­

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What does that have to do

22

with whether the First Amendment applies, with all of

23

its prohibitions against vagueness?

24
25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

The answer again, Your

Honor, is when it comes to judges, we tolerate quite a
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

bit more by way of chill of a judge's vote precisely

2

because judges are supposed to act judicial and purge

3

their vote of all extraneous effects.

4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

would have been much more attracted to your position.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

8
9

That's too bad, because I

I -- I understand, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and Mr. Rosenkranz,

10

what about officials in the Executive Branch?

11

Secretary of Defense gives a speech and the President

12

doesn't like it and the President fires the Secretary of

13

Defense, does the Secretary of Defense have a First

14

Amendment action?

15

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

When the

The Secretary of Defense

16

has a First Amendment argument.

17

one under -- under this Court's opinion in Garcetti.

18

But his First Amendment rights are implicated if it's a

19

speech that he's giving not in the line of his duty.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It would be a very weak

So all the official acts in

21

the legislature, in the Executive Branch, you're somehow

22

saying courts are different, so I guess we don't have to

23

worry about that, but official acts across the

24

government are now subject to First Amendment analysis?

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Absolutely not, Your Honor,

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and that was this Court's holding in Garcetti.

2

reason this Court held that in Garcetti was that there

3

the government is acting as employer.

4

entitled to discipline its own employees like any other

5

employer can.

6

that Pickering standard, doesn't really work in the

7

context of regulation of political activity.

8
9

And the

The government is

But we all agree government as employer,

JUSTICE ALITO:

What about the rules of

civility in the houses of Congress?

There are things

10

that a member of the Senate, for example, cannot say

11

about another Senator, or make a personal attack.

12

would be protected by the First Amendment if the Senator

13

stepped outside the door.

14

Amendment protection for that?

15

rules have to pass First Amendment scrutiny?

Are those -- is there First

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

16

That

Do they have -- do those

17

Honor, no, if it's just the chamber that's sanctioning

order the -- the debate.

And the reason is those are Roberts Rules of

But I -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

Well, I don't understand

22

that.

I mean, this rule applies to everyone, too.

23

might apply to one person on one vote and to another

24

person on another vote, but everybody at every vote has

25

to look at these ethical rules and decide whether they

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

have to recuse themselves as a result.

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And -- and so this is a

3

rule, though -- we have to go back to what its effect is

4

outside of the legislature.

5

political associations and treats them as corrupting,

6

core political associations, volunteering of the sort -­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This is a rule that takes

Well, do you think that if

8

there were a statute -- let's take out the vagueness

9

aspect of this.

If there were a statute that said you

10

can't vote on anything where you have yourself some

11

monetary gain attached to it or if a very close family

12

member or if a close business associate or campaign

13

manager of your campaign, do you think that would be

14

unconstitutional?

15

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

It would not be vague, Your

16

Honor.

But it would be unconstitutional, unless the

17

State demonstrates why a campaign manager is corrupting.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because the -- the State -­

19

what the State thinks is that a campaign manager is just

20

like a business partner.

21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And -- and the answer to

22

that is no.

A volunteer campaign manager is not just

23

like a business partner.

24

the -- to the candidate or the legislator as there is in

25

a relationship with a business partner.

There is no pecuniary gain to

32

Alderson Reporting Company

There's

Official - Subject to Final Review

personal political loyalty.

2

Commission said was wrong -­

3

That's what the Ethics

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- no -- there's no -- I

4

thought this -- the -- the only reason that we have this

5

case is that the three-time campaign manager was -- did

6

have a financial stake in this vote because the project

7

was approved.

8
9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:
why we're here.

No, Your Honor, that's not

That's not why the commission said we

10

are here in the first instance.

11

saying we're here because of that, but what the

12

commission said was it's the closeness of this

13

relationship, without regard to the financial gain,

14

which the commission accepted was zero for this

15

particular lobbyist.

16

it was the political loyalty.

17

Because he helped you win, you will be beholden to him

18

and do him more favors.

19
20
21

The commission is now

Regardless of the financial gain,
This guy helped you win.

Well, lots of political activists help a
candidate win.

But on that -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it -- it seems to me

22

that if you're going to make this argument -- and this

23

is the point we discussed with Mr. Elwood -- there are

24

two ways to do it.

25

Number one, say this infringes the

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

can say that this impinges unduly on necessary rights of

2

association that preceded your election to the

3

legislative post.

4

It seems to me that the latter is the only

5

way that you can make your case and to avoid the force

6

of the argument that the Petitioner makes.

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, it is certainly

8

correct that the latter is far narrower.

9

outlier statute.

This is an

No other legislature has ever adopted

10

a statute that says campaign manager or political

11

loyalty is corrupting.

12

easily say, look, this is just different from all of the

13

other recusal statutes.

14

And so this Court could very

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It doesn't seem to be

15

different from the ones that Mr. Elwood read to us.

16

think he read probably one from New Jersey and -­

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, he -- he cited

18

one case from New Jersey.

19

political loyalty.

20

friendship, and in the course of describing the close

21

friendship the court, after listing multiple factors,

22

said one of them was that they were both part of the

23

same political club.

24

That's a completely different application.

25

I

The statute does not refer to

They also vacationed together.

No State and no commission -- so far as we
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

know from the briefs, there's no case cited where any

commission has said this relationship between a

volunteer and a candidate is itself so corrupting that

4

we have to disqualify the candidate from casting the

5

vote, the vote that he ran on, that the voters elected

6

him to cast.

7

And if this -- if this is accepted, it

8

places an impossible drag on the associational rights.

9

The candidate will have to think twice before ever

10

hiring or enlisting a volunteer who is a political

11

activist.

12

talented, the most savvy, but he will always have to ask

13

himself:

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I mean -­
No, Your Honor.

Let me

20

give you a concrete example from real life that happens

21

all the time.

22

believe strongly in a piece of legislation and they hire

23

a lobbyist, so there's benefit to the lobbyist from this

24

relationship, and that lobbyist says "I, too, am on

If the NRA or NARAL decide that they

Alderson Reporting Company

it hangs in the balance, I'm going to work for

2

candidates who will tip the balance for me, the

3

commission's opinion says that that lobbyist, because

4

he's worked on that campaign and wins, will by that very

5

act invalidate the vote of the legislator.

6

That's just untenable, and there's no way to

7

interpret the -- the opinion that the commission

8

actually wrote to make that anything other than the

9

natural consequence of its -- of its opinion.

10

And worse yet, from the -- from the -­

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If that's what it means,

12

you would think the legislature would change it,

13

wouldn't you?

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well -­

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it doesn't just

16

hurt Mr. Carrigan.

That -- you know, that -- that would

17

be something every legislator would -- would worry about

18

and say, oh, boy, we've got to change this.

19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor -­

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So why don't we let them

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

21
22

change it?
Yet the

23

legislature comes in with an amicus brief to this Court

24

and says that its interpretation of this statute is all

25

it needs to have is a relationship that is analogous or
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

parallel to those -- this is on page 32 of their amicus

2

brief -- analogous or parallel, and they are defending

3

the application of this statute to political loyalty.

4

But let's look at the other side of the

5

equation; that is the -- the Vasquezes of the world, the

6

NRA advocate.

7

deeply holds a view that's political -- let's say it's

Mr. Vasquez, he is pro-development.

from joining campaigns out of fear that when they join

11

So why -- I mean, what the

12

commission says is Mr. Vasquez has been a close personal

13

friend, confidante, and political advisor throughout the

14

years.

15

sounds like somebody sitting on a case where his best

friend is likely to gain millions of dollars.

So that doesn't sound like any volunteer.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what it seems when I

the independence of judgment.

JUSTICE BREYER:

These were

That's part of it.

But

7

my -- my basic question is, as you know, with judges,

8

and I guess you have a very vague statute which was

9

quoted to you, and what we have are subsidiary rules

10

with ethics commissioners.

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So I did want to talk just for a moment

2

about the degree of burden that we're talking about

3

here, because the commission seems to be saying no big

deal, this is just a disqualification provision.

5

not actually a burden at all.

6

It's

Now, I think we all agree that if the State

of Nevada declared that anyone who is a campaign manager

can never lobby the legislature, that would be

9

unconstitutional, and they'll fine them for it, where

10

the strict scrutiny would also apply if the State passed

who lobbies the legislature.

formed, but on the ground that you don't want

23

legislators here and now as they are sitting in the

future clients and changing their votes because of that.

And that would be justified on the

Alderson Reporting Company

2

That's the justification.
But there's no such justification here.

The

3

commission has never articulated why political loyalty

4

is so toxic that it needs to be banished from politics.

5

And so, just on the -- on the directness of the burden

6

yet, for a political activist who is engaged in these

7

sorts of relationships, the burden of being told, you've

8

got to choose right at the outset, are you going to

9

represent -- are you going to help this candidate get

10

elected or are you going to lobby?

11

fine, because a political activist wants to do both

12

precisely because they care about the ultimate results.

13

That is worse than a

And for the candidate himself who is

14

deciding right upfront which of the universe of players

15

am I going to take as volunteers, they need to know

16

upfront whether this relationship will be viewed as

17

toxic, and if it is, they will not engage in that

18

relationship.

19

This is no less direct than the burden that

20

this Court recognized as unconstitutional in the Davis

21

case, the Millionaire's Amendment Case, or in Burdick,

22

where the only burden was that the paid petitioner would

23

have to register to vote, which is a nominal burden, but

were kept out of the process.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. ELWOOD:

Now, my colleague argues that

the Nevada recusal statute targets political

10

association, and that is simply not the case.

11

in the statute about politics.

12

because he had a business relationship with Mr. Vasquez.

13

Wholly apart from the personal relationship and the fact

14

that he was his three-time campaign manager, he was also

15

the firm -- the campaign's main outside vendor, and 89

16

percent of the Carrigan campaign expenditures were paid

17

through his advertising firm.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Nothing

Mr. Carrigan was recused

That is -­
I think his argument is --

19

I don't see -- that the Ethics Commission at least in

20

part relied upon the fact that he was the campaign

21

manager, and he is saying, I think, as I understand it,

22

or at least I have this question, that an ethics

23

commission cannot disqualify a legislator on the ground,

24

even in part, that an individual had a political

25

association with him previously.

If Mr. Carrigan had had exactly the same relationship,

it was in the context of making a vagueness argument.

If they based their decision

solely on the -- on the fact that Vasquez had been the

manager, and perhaps Carrigan would like him to be his

campaign manager in the future, would there be a problem

23

then?

24
25

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that -- I think

probably not, because if the question is whether it -­
52

it burdens associations so much that it's chilling, and

question.

interest, a private interest in order to be recused, I

5

think that it wouldn't arise so frequently that it would

6

be a problem; but I think more fundamentally here, or at

7

least for purposes of this case, because it comes here

8

at least Respondent says this as an as-applied

9

challenge.

And because you have to have a particular

What we have here is a relationship that was

legislative history of the '99 Act, and they would say
