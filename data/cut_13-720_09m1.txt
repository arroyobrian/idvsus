 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MELNIK 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9
10

 MR. MELNIK: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

11

 Brulotte's per se ban on patent royalties on 

12

postexpiration use should be discarded because it is a 

13

rule without a reason.  Brulotte is widely recognized as 

14

an outdated and misguided decision that prohibits 

15

royalty arrangements that are frequently socially 

16

beneficial. 

17

 Brulotte suppresses innovation and 

18

interferes with the goals of the patent system, 

19

increasing the likelihood that potentially breakthrough 

20

discoveries by universities and research hospitals such 

21

as the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center will never reach 

22

patients and consumers.  Discarding 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

They are now, so what 

are they doing? 
 MR. MELNIK: 

I apologize.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I mean, it's not 

2

like the industry has fallen apart.  I don't see any 

3

examples of  of this. 

4

 MR. MELNIK: 

Well, the  the examples that 

5

we have are the amicus briefs.  In other words, the 

6

entities that are  that do this licensing on a 

7

daytoday basis are telling the Court in their amicus 

8

briefs that the  the Brulotte rule is having this 

9

suppressed effect; in other words, that certain 

10
11

licensing arrangements that would otherwise 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why  why should that be 

12

so, given what you say?  In  in your brief you say, 

13

license  this is at 9 and 10, bottom of 9  the 

14

"license payment terms, consequently, reflect the 

15

anticipated value of the authorization to use the 

16

patented invention before the patent expires." 

17

 All you have to do is make it clear that, 

18

although the payments continue after expiration, they 

19

are for the preexpiration period. 

20

 So it's  it's  I don't understand why 

21

this should be so troublesome if the contract says these 

22

payments will be spread out over whatever period of 

23

time, but they are for the patent during the period when 

24

it was valid.  If you say the next sentence is "even if 

25

they're nominally measured by postexpiration use, they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

nonetheless represent an amortization of the predicted 

2

value of the preexpiration authorization."  If you say 

3

that in the contract, then I don't see where there's a 

4

problem. 

5

 MR. MELNIK: 

The distinction, Justice 

6

Ginsburg, is between what you're paying for and how 

7

you're paying for it.  The what that you're paying for 

8

is an estimate of the value of the use of the patent 

9

during the patent term. 

10

 What Brulotte currently permits is one 

11

method of how to pay for it, which is to defer payment 

12

into the postexpiration period.  What Brulotte doesn't 

13

currently permit is to defer  is to stretch the 

14

royalty base, to defer accrual into the postexpiration 

15

period.  And deferred accrual allows parties to do 

16

something that deferred payment does not, which is to 

17

shift the risk of commercialization failure and 

18

innovation failure from the licensee to the licensor. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Aren't there ways to get 

20

around that as well?  I mean, why don't you just enter 

21

into a joint venture? 

22

 MR. MELNIK: 

So, Justice Kagan, I guess my 

23

first answer to that is that's not the right question. 

24

The right question is, if you're prohibiting something 

25

that doesn't make sense, the initial question should be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1
2

why are you prohibiting it?  But 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, possibly, except that 

3

we have statutory stare decisis, and to the extent that 

4

we think something is not really causing a problem in 

5

the real world, why overrule something against that 

6

basic backdrop principle? 

7

 MR. MELNIK: 

So the  the next answer to 

8

your question, then, is that the  the alternative 

9

arrangements are not risk redistributive in the same way 

10

that royalty  that the deferral of accrual is 

11

riskfree distributive.  What do I mean by that?  If you 

12

stretch the royalty base into the postexpiration period 

13

in situations where you're  where early stage 

14

technology is involved where there may not be any sales 

15

until fairly late and stretching into the 

16

postexpiration period, you allow the licensee to say, 

17

I'm going to take on this risk but in exchange, 

18

licensor, you're going to bear the risk that if the 

19

product fails, I won't have to pay much because if there 

20

aren't any sales, I don't have to pay you. 

21

 Payment postponement, for example, doesn't 

22

allow the parties to do that because even if you 

23

postpone the payment, you still owe.  The obligation to 

24

pay has accrued during the term, and even if you have to 

25

pay later, you still have to pay.  That's the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

fundamental difference between payment postponement, 

2

which is not risk redistributive and  which is 

3

permitted by Brulotte.  And accrual postponement 

4

which 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, but I was suggesting 

6

that either could be accomplished, both could be 

7

accomplished through other means, and particularly 

8

through just entering into a joint venture rather than 

9

having a license arrangement. 

10

 MR. MELNIK: 

So those kinds of arrangements 

11

may not be realistic for the kinds of entities that are 

12

most directly impacted by the Brulotte prohibition; 

13

universities, research hospitals particular 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is that what it is?  Because 

15

when I was looking at the amicus briefs here, I was 

16

struck by the fact that there really are  are not 

17

companies on the amicus brief.  There are not forprofit 

18

entities.  It's all nonprofit entities.  And is that 

19

because nonprofit entities have this particular problem, 

20

that they can't make the arrangements that would 

21

otherwise get around the Brulotte rule? 

22

 MR. MELNIK: 

Well, it's not all nonprofits. 

23

We had  we had an amicus brief from Biotime which was 

24

a  a private company's.  But one of the  one of the 

25

groups of entities that are most directly impacted are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

universities, research hospitals, and the like because 

2

they're the ones where the  the  not all license 

3

licensing situations are going to be a good fit for 

4

for accrual deferral.  In many situations, this kind of 

5

arrangement may not make sense for the parties, and they 

6

wouldn't enter into it. 

7

 One paradigmatic example in the situation 

8

where the parties may desire to defer accrual but are 

9

prohibited by Brulotte from doing so are very early 

10

stage technology.  And who generates early stage 

11

technology?  It's frequently universities, research 

12

hospitals, and the like.  So, yes, those are entities 

13

one of the groups of entities that are most directly 

14

affected by the 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well  well, you  you 

16

quoted in  in your brief extensively about quotes from 

17

the hospital briefs and  and the  and the research 

18

briefs.  But these parties have recently been to 

19

Congress with reference to the whole drug and 

20

pharmaceutical industry, and Congress is certainly aware 

21

of this rule and has left it alone.  And you're asking 

22

us now to add on to the remedies Congress has already 

23

given. 

24
25

 MR. MELNIK: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, I would 

say that not so recently  and I think that we have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

demonstrated special justification within the meaning of 

2

this Court's case law for overruling this kind of 

3

precedent, and I would say that we have demonstrated it 

4

in four ways. 

5

 First, we have shown that since the Court 

6

considered Brulotte, the patent equals market power 

7

presumption has fallen, and it  and it has fallen 

8

actually since the time  last time that Congress 

9

looked at this in 1988. 

10

 There has been a foundational shift 

11

second, there has been a foundational shift in 

12

competition law away from per se rules and toward 

13

contextualized rules such as the rule of reason. 

14

 Third, economists and other experts in the 

15

licensing and  and patent field have reached a much 

16

more nuanced understanding of the economics of 

17

postexpiration royalties, an understanding that didn't 

18

exist at the time this Court has found 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Is that  you  those are 

20

the three points, and I just wonder, imagine I have a 

21

piece of intellectual property which I have patented and 

22

now I have 55 potential licensees.  And I say to each of 

23

them, I will license to you and you will pay me next to 

24

nothing for any use up to 20 years while you're figuring 

25

out how to use it.  But if it turns out you use it, in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

years 20 to 30, you pay me a lot for each use.  Okay? 

2

That's the problem, isn't it? 

3

 MR. MELNIK: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
Now I've done it for 55, 

5

and there are a lot of good reasons for getting them to 

6

do that.  I understand the reasons.  I just wonder how 

7

you reconcile that with the Constitution's requirement 

8

that patents are for limited terms, and statute which 

9

says the limited term is 20 years.  Because if that 

10

means something, I suppose it means that after that 

11

statutory period of 20 limited years, people can use 

12

that intellectual property for free. 

13

 Now  now, if it doesn't mean that, what 

14

does it mean?  And if it does mean that, I mean, how did 

15

my example allow people to use it for free?  Not  I 

16

mean, they couldn't use it for free.  They had to pay. 

17

 MR. MELNIK: 

The way that I would reconcile 

18

it, Justice Breyer, is  is to decouple the notion of 

19

the right to exclude, which is what the statutory term 

20

is about, the right to prevent the public as a whole 

21

from using the patented invention from the specific 

22

royalty arrangement.  Once, as  as Chief Justice 

23

Chief Justice Posner put it in Scheiber, once the patent 

24

expires expiration is accomplished what it was supposed 

25

to 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It is.  And everybody who

2

might use this, by the way, any conceivable person, 

3

there were only 53 people who might ever use it, and I 

4

got 55 to sign up.  And therefore, nobody's going to use 

5

it without paying.  I'm just saying how, in my example, 

6

do we reconcile that with the constitutional and 

7

statutory mandate that after 20 years it's free? 

8

 MR. MELNIK: 

9

 First is we have to remember that what we're 

10

dealing with here is a per se rule.  A per se rule 

11

prohibits all hypotheticals, not just one hypothetical. 

12

We're not advocating per se legality. 

13
14
15
16

So, let me make two points. 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

In my case, it would be 

unlawful. 
 MR. MELNIK: 

I'm  I'm not saying that.  I 

was  I was getting to the second point. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MR. MELNIK: 

What's the second point? 
The second point is that  is 

19

that in the  in the postexpiration period, even in 

20

your situation, what we're really dealing with are the 

21

prices and outputs at which the public is going to 

22

access the invention. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And I'll tell you, in my 

24

example, the price and output is a big payment to the 

25

owner of the patent in year 29.  That's the price and 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

output.  And the output is restricted because the price

2

is up. 

3

 MR. MELNIK: 

So by  during the term, the 

4

license  the  the licensees got to use the 

5

invention. 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I know there are a 

7

lot of good reasons for it.  My simple question was how 

8

you reconcile the fact that everybody is paying a lot of 

9

money to use this intellectual property in year 29 with 

10

what seems a statute and a Constitution that say it 

11

should be free at that time.  That's what I'm asking.  I 

12

don't want to ask it again because I don't like to ask a 

13

question more than four times. 

14

 MR. MELNIK: 

I  I apologize if I have not 

15

been clear in my answer.  Let me take another shot at 

16

this. 

17

 The  the answer to your question is that 

18

one needs to  in our view, is that one needs to 

19

decouple the right  the right to exclude, which is 

20

what the term is about, from the royalty arrangement. 

21

Understand 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If by that  if by 

23

that you mean that there will be a lot of new people 

24

coming in who  because they don't have to pay the 

25

license fee in year 29, and it's very easy for them to 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

figure out what to do because they can copy the patent

2

and anybody can come and see, I can make one of these. 

3

All the competition  in fact, everybody who was in the 

4

business is paying an extra  has to charge an extra $2 

5

because of this license fee, I won't have to charge an 

6

extra $2.  I'll go into that business and make a lot of 

7

money. 

8
9
10
11

 MR. MELNIK: 

That's certainly correct, Mr. 

Chief Justice.  And that's a point that we made in the 
brief. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's correct only if, 

12

unfortunately, to get into this business because the 

13

patent happens to be  to do with a gizmo, and the 

14

gizmo is 14 feet deep buried inside a computer and the 

15

computer is 19,000 meters tall, and so there are only 55 

16

people, conceivably, who could get into this business, 

17

and they are all licensed. 

18

 MR. MELNIK: 

So if the question is can 

19

one  can one come up with a hypothetical where the 

20

arrangement would be impermissible because it would 

21

violate the rule of reason, the answer is yes. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But why are we 

23

importing  it's a fair question by the Respondents and 

24

others.  Why are we importing antitrust principles, 

25

which already have their own set of problems.  We have a 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

rule of reason, and we've now done a quick look instead

2

of a per se look, and everybody complains about the 

3

expense related to the rule of reason.  Why are we 

4

importing into patent law the economic principle?  You 

5

fault us for doing that in our original decision, but 

6

you're asking us to perpetuate that anyway.  Antitrust 

7

law could take care of this by itself.  We don't have to 

8

import this into patent law at all. 

9

 MR. MELNIK: 

So the  I guess I would 

10

question the premise that  Justice Sotomayor, that 

11

we're asking you to import the rule of reason because 

12

the current standard that the Federal circuit and other 

13

courts of appeals have applied to  to analyze patent 

14

misuse and have been doing it for decades is already the 

15

rule of reason. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, they use it for 

17

for coercion and fraud.  So why don't we do what one of 

18

your amici suggested or one of the amici suggested, 

19

which is to say reverse Brulotte  Brulotte, and let 

20

coercion and fraud exist. 

21

 MR. MELNIK: 

That would be an approach that 

22

we also would think would make sense.  That would be 

23

drawn on this Court's precedent in Zenith, and we 

24

would 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And I bet that in  how 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

long has Brulotte been around?

2

 MR. MELNIK: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

50 years. 
In another 50 years, 

4

there'll be an attorney sitting here telling us that we 

5

were wrong in that presumption, too.  Why don't we just 

6

let Congress fix it, because if it's wrong, people can 

7

complain to it. 

8
9

 MR. MELNIK: 

Well, so the answer to the 

question is that we  I would submit that we have 

10

demonstrated the special  special justification that 

11

this Court's precedent requires. 

12
13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, could you go back to 

that? 

14

 MR. MELNIK: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
Because you  you named 

16

three things, and honestly, it all seemed to my ears 

17

different variants of Brulotte is wrong.  But, of 

18

course, special justifications demand more than the 

19

decision is wrong.  So let's even say the decision is 

20

wrong.  Economists think the decision is wrong by 

21

everybody thinks the decision is wrong.  That's not a 

22

special justification.  What's the special 

23

justification? 

24
25

 MR. MELNIK: 

The distinction that I would 

draw, Justice Kagan, is  is between the  the  the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

decision is wrong argument is these arguments were

2

presented to the Court at the time the Court made the 

3

decision, and now you are rearguing those arguments. 

4

That's the decision is the wrong argument.  The points 

5

that I were making were new things that had emerged 

6

since the Court decided Brulotte.  None of those 

7

arguments were presented to the Court. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but usually we ask for 

more than that.  Usually we ask for something that says 

10

this is just unworkable.  We thought it was right 

11

before, but we can't make it work now.  That's not this. 

12

Or we say this is completely anomalous.  It just 

13

can't  it  it's a relic of a past system that is 

14

utterly out of kilter.  I don't think that's this 

15

either, you know.  It may or may not be right, but 

16

there's nothing incredibly sort of weird and  and 

17

anomalous about it.  I mean, usually we look for things 

18

like that.  And where are those things? 

19

 MR. MELNIK: 

Well, one thing that we do have 

20

in this case that's  that's unusual is the complete 

21

lack of reliance impact that this Court has overruled. 

22

That make  for example, that makes 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, even if I assume that 

24

that's right, that there's no special reliance push, 

25

still we have a very strong rule of statutory stare 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

decisis.  We need some special justification to break

2

away from that rule.  I guess I'm still waiting to hear 

3

what it is other than, you know, we now know better than 

4

we knew before. 

5
6
7

 MR. MELNIK: 

So the  I had 4 points.  I 

didn't get to get my fourth point out. 
 So the fourth point was that we have a 

8

better understanding of the real world impact, of the 

9

innovation suppressing effect of these kinds of royalty 

10

arrangements that we're hearing from the amicus briefs. 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But that surely is a 

12

question for Congress, to go back to what Justice 

13

Sotomayor was saying, you know, to the extent that 

14

there's a real world problem, and maybe there is and 

15

maybe there's not, it's a little bit hard to tell from 

16

the amicus briefs.  I mean, they're surely better 

17

equipped than we are to deal with that. 

18

 MR. MELNIK: 

So the same thing could have 

19

been said, for example, in Illinois Tool Works which 

20

dealt with the exact same prior congressional enactment, 

21

with the  exact same one of the same bills that was 

22

that was referred to in the red brief.  And this Court, 

23

nevertheless, overruled that that equals market power 

24

presumption responding to the overwhelming criticism of 

25

that presumption in the expert literature. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

 We have the same here. 

We have near

2

unanimous consensus in the expert literature that all of 

3

these new understandings have emerged since Brulotte has 

4

been decided that undermine every single premise on 

5

which Brulotte was based. 

6

 And the same was true in BlonderTongue, 

7

which was the subject of the discussion in the first 

8

case this morning where this Court overruled prior 

9

decisions in  and changed a judgemade rule in the 

10

patent law context.  And the government in that case 

11

filed an amicus brief that said the fact that Congress 

12

has failed to act even though it has considered the 

13

issue is, quoteunquote, "of no significance." 

14

 So if the Court could do it in 

15

BlonderTongue and the Court could do it in Illinois 

16

Tool Works, the Court could do it here. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That was a case about 

18

preclusion.  It was  it was really not a patent issue 

19

like we were discussing. 

20

 MR. MELNIK: 

Well, you're  you're correct, 

21

Justice Ginsburg, that it was a case about mutuality of 

22

estoppel in patent litigation, but it  it implicated 

23

very important patent policy issues because it asked the 

24

question of if you invalidate the patent once, is it 

25

invalid for all time, or can you relitigate the issue? 

Alderson Reporting Company

So yes, you can say that it was a procedural issue, but

2

it was an issue that implicated core patent law. 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it was a  it was a 

4

decision that applies  generally applies across the 

5

board, not just in patent litigation  . 

6

 MR. MELNIK: 

My recollection  and I 

7

apologize because it's been a few weeks since I read 

8

BlonderTongue  my recollection is that the issue was 

9

specific to mutuality of estoppel in patent litigation. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess what it seems to me 

11

you are arguing, and maybe we've done this before, and 

12

maybe we haven't, but what it seems to me you are 

13

arguing is a sort of new rationale for when to depart 

14

from statutory stare decisis, and that new rationale is 

15

when a prior decision is based on what we now view to be 

16

naive economics.  I mean, that's the fundamental 

17

argument here, isn't it? 

18

 MR. MELNIK: 

It's  it's one of the 

19

arguments.  I think it's  you also have to look at a 

20

new understanding of the realworld impact.  And it's 

21

not  it's not  it's not just the impact that  that 

22

Chief Judge Posner and the other 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Okay, so let's say it's 

24

those two things, because we think a prior decision is 

25

based on naive economics, and because we think that that 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

decision has some bad realworld consequences.  But

2

again, both of those things seem to me to be 

3

congressional choices, much more than judicial choices, 

4

that it's Congress that's better positioned to assess 

5

the realworld impact, and it's Congress that's better 

6

positioned to say whether these economic theories are 

7

indeed so naive. 

8
9

 MR. MELNIK: 

If  I guess I would submit 

that if that were the case, then the results in Illinois 

10

Tool Works and BlonderTongue would be different than 

11

they were.  The principle that you're espousing can't be 

12

a categorical principle.  Stare decisis is after all a 

13

practical doctrine. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Economics certainly plays 

15

an important role in antitrust.  But what I have learned 

16

that economists frequently don't take account of is the 

17

administrative cost of administering by judges a complex 

18

rule.  The point of my questions was to suggest to you 

19

how complex that would be.  I mean, when, under a rule 

20

of reason, which you advocate, would something like this 

21

be lawful or unlawful?  Does it depend upon how many 

22

people you license?  Does it depend upon the height of 

23

entry barriers, something that is notoriously difficult 

24

to estimate?  Does  and what is the principle under 

25

which a rule of reason is violated? 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

 None of those things are decided. 

The 

2

you're asking us to decide things under your system that 

3

I would find very difficult to decide.  And the virtues 

4

of a simple rule are obvious.  So it isn't even obvious 

5

to me that putting stare decisis to the side, it would 

6

be wise, since none of the economists, even including 

7

Judge Posner, do, in fact, discuss this problem of 

8

administering a complex rule of reason rule  rule of 

9

reason in a complicated area, 50 years after the simple 

10
11

rule has been in effect. 
 MR. MELNIK: 

So two responses to your point, 

12

Justice Breyer.  One is I think it's again important to 

13

remember that the rule  the question is not whether 

14

the rule of reason should apply to patent misuse.  The 

15

rule of reason already applies to patent misuse under 

16

decades of Federal Circuit precedent.  That's the state 

17

of the world right now.  The question is only whether 

18

these particular types of royalty arrangements should be 

19

aligned with the existing rule of reason regime for 

20

patent misuse that already exists in the world. 

21

 The second point is that I think we need to 

22

remember that these are negotiated transactions, that 

23

this kind of royalty arrangement will only exist if the 

24

licensor and the licensee both agree that it makes sense 

25

for them.  And any answer can be priced into the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

license.  After all, who is going to bear the risk of

2

the rule of reason analysis?  It's primarily going to be 

3

the licensor, because the licensee will at some point, 

4

presumably after expiration, will say, I don't want to 

5

pay royalties anymore.  And it will  would be the 

6

licensor who will, at that point, have to initiate the 

7

lawsuit to collect the royalties. 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

I  it seems to me 

that the logic of your position is going to govern most 

10

of what you  you say, oh, you can always look at it 

11

under rule of reason, but it's hard for me to imagine 

12

what type of case would fail the rule of reason given 

13

your logic for overturning Brulotte in the first place. 

14

 MR. MELNIK: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well 
Just give me an 

16

example, that this would be permitted under your 

17

position but would violate the rule of reason. 

18

 MR. MELNIK: 

So I suppose the classic 

19

example would be the one that Professor Hovenkamp and 

20

his coauthors give at page 334 of the IP and Antitrust 

21

Treatise.  This is at the end of Section 3.3c. 

22

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Maybe you could 

remind me which one it is. 
 MR. MELNIK:

won't be as able to summarize it as ably as they can,

but they basically set out four conditions:  One, the

4

relevant market; two, the license requires licensees to 

5

pay royalties on all products sold in the market 

6

regardless of whether or not they use the patented 

7

technology, so there is no  even if you stop paying 

8

the technology  using the technology, you still have 

9

to pay.  There are substantial entry barriers, and the 

10
11

licensees make up most of the market.  I 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I failed the antitrust

case.  Couldn't the licensee come in and file an 

13

antitrust case? 

14

 MR. MELNIK: 

That would  Professor 

15

Hovenkamp and his coauthors raised that as  as a 

16

situation where there  where there would be questions 

17

raised about whether that would violate the rule of

19

20

was  that's an example in the academic literature.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. SAUNDERS 

8
9
10
11

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 
 MR. SAUNDERS: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 This case should begin and end with stare 

12

decisis.  Brulotte remains correctly decided and serves 

13

important public interest grounded in patent law. 

14

But at this point, were any change needed, Congress 

15

would be the appropriate institution to balance the 

16

competing arguments, and if you consider the public and 

17

private reliance interests.  Indeed Congress 

18

specifically considered proposals to modify Brulotte, 

19

and declined to do so even while making other changes to 

20

patent misuse. 

21

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

After 1988?  How recently 

has Congress taken a look at Brulotte? 
 MR. SAUNDERS: 

The  the example I'm 

24

speaking of is 1988.  I  I don't know more recently, 

25

but of course, even without that specific compelling 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

example of them having taken a look at it, made other

2

changes to patent misuse, and not changed it, the point 

3

remains that Congress could look at it at any time, and 

4

all of the complicated economic 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that really 

6

proves too much.  I mean, we overruled, you know, 

7

Lowe's, Albrecht, Arnold, Schwinn, those are all cases 

8

from the mid 1960's, just like this one was.  It's a 

9

problem with the '60s, and we're going  the same 

10

argument you make now should have prevented us from 

11

doing that in all those other cases. 

12

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

I  I think that this Court 

13

has recognized that in the antitrust context, where you 

14

have such a barebones statute and a long history of very 

15

minimal congressional action in that area, this Court 

16

has had a greater willingness to overturn its precedent. 

17

In the Patent Act, this is an area where Congress has 

18

revisited it frequently, 33 times since 1952; important 

19

to this case, has revisited the patent term, changed the 

20

patent term, added patent term extensions, patent term 

21

adjustments, carefully calibrating the incentives to 

22

strike what it considers to be the correct balance with 

23

Brulotte as settled law.  And so there's a risk in 

24

overturning Brulotte of upsetting that balance. 

25

 I would also say as the antitrust cases, and 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

this point's made very nicely in the Washington Legal

2

Foundation amicus brief, that the reliance interests in 

3

that situation looks different.  From the perspective of 

4

the party that's going to be held liable for paying out, 

5

there is a big difference in moving from a per se rule 

6

of liability  no one's out there relying and saying, 

7

well, I'm certainly going to be liable if I do this 

8

moving from that to rule of reason analysis.  Whereas 

9

here, for the party that's going to be required to pay 

10

the perpetual royalties, what you have under existing 

11

law is the shield of Brulotte in place.  And you'd be 

12

talking about removing that shield after the fact. 

13

 And we have a law here, you know, there's a 

14

reason that, in addition to the idea of statutory stare 

15

decisis, we give particular effect to stare decisis when 

16

we're talking about contracts and property right, 

17

because for 50 years, parties have entered into 

18

agreements and made postexpiration business decisions 

19

with Brulotte as settled law. 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But these parties didn't 

even know about Brulotte.  I mean 
 MR. SAUNDERS: 

Right, in this particular 

23

case, but I think it would be hazardous to extrapolate 

24

from that to  to disregard the reliance interest for 

25

something that's been in law  been in place for so

2

and in which, as we cite in our brief, you have 

3

treatises.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand what 

5

6

they rely?

provision for postexpiration payments? 
 MR. SAUNDERS: 

That would be one form, and 

11

the treatise we cite in our brief says, quote, "it's not 

12

always necessary to specify the term." 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How would we be 

14

disappointing that reliance?  I don't understand what 

15

reliance we would be disappointing. 

16

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

If someone doesn't specify 

17

the term in their  the licensee, because of the  the 

18

rule of Brulotte cuts off the royalties after patent 

19

expiration, if because of that they don't specify the 

20

expiration term 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The  the only person I 

22

think we could be disappointing is the person who knows 

23

of this exotic law and enters a contract which provides 

24

for posttermination payments knowing that that will be 

25

invalid.  Now, him we would disappoint, wouldn't we?

2

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

Someone who in these 

3

complicated negotiations may not think it's necessary to 

4

ask for a particular term 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's been conceded 

6

here.  Marvel has said in this litigation, in your 

7

brief, I believe, that they didn't know about Brulotte. 

8
9
10

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

That  that's correct in 

this litigation. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

is no reliance by them. 

12

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

So this hasn't  this 

No direct reliance by them. 

13

I think it's  which doesn't mean it's not happening 

14

for other people, and I also think it's important to 

15

remember that the idea of indirect reliance 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I guess the only person 

17

who would be injured would be the licensor because 

18

they'd be the only one acting in negotiation without 

19

knowing the legal rule. 

20

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, I 
It should be Mr. Kimble 

22

who would be disappointed if we upheld Brulotte, because 

23

he's going to be deprived of royalties that he thought 

24

he was going to earn. 

25

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

No.  I don't think 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

that that's the correct way of looking at it.  And I

2

also think it's important to remember that when you have 

3

a settled legal rule like this, it affects whether 

4

people even spot the issue.  This issue has been taken 

5

off the table for 5 decades.  No one's reading cases 

6

about the horrors of perpetual royalties.  No one is 

7

going to continuing legal education courses and being 

8

told about this issue.  Maybe 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The economists are. 

10

I mean, the economists are almost unanimous that this is 

11

a very bad rule.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

14

nobody is thinking about it.

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

I 
So it's not as if 

I'm talking about the parties 

16

that are engaging in those negotiations.  But I also 

17

think that the economics here are disputed.  I would 

18

refer the Court to the Baxter article that we cite, 

19

William Baxter.  The William Baxter, before he was head 

20

of the antitrust division, does the economic analysis 

21

here looking at the effects on the marginal costs after 

22

patent expiration.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is one of the arguments 

10

that there have been years of reliance with making joint 

11

venture agreements, with making other contracts that 

12

don't  that don't depend on royalty payments, or that 

13

there's ways of getting around this?  Because if that's 

14

an argument, it seems to me that that cuts both ways. 

15

It's easy to get around this rule I  I take it in many 

16

instances by just having a joint venture agreement. 

17
18
19

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

There  there are many 

alternatives that would achieve the 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But doesn't that 

20

doesn't that cut against you as much as it cuts in your 

21

favor? 

22

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

No, I don't think so, because 

23

you still may have the parties out there who will be 

24

left exposed.  You also have had what I would say is the 

25

legislative reliance in terms of Congress tinkering with 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

the Patent Act and setting very specific balances with

2

Brulotte as settled law. 

3

 And in addition to all this, I mean, the 

4

we've been talking in the  the economic criticism 

5

coming from the antitrust perspective, but it's 

6

important to remember here that this is originally 

7

grounded in patent policy.  And what you have is 

8

Congress has set a limited window of opportunity in 

9

which you have the opportunity to capture, quite 

10

frankly, not just the value of your own invention, but a 

11

certain amount of followon invention that may build on 

12

and incorporate your invention, and that is set within 

13

that particular window. 

14

 And once you begin going beyond that, by 

15

contract, there's increased risk that what's going to 

16

cause sales to spike in the 30th year is not your own 

17

original innovation, but the followon innovation, the 

18

innovation of your licensee. 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But everybody is 

20

can do  can practice the patent after its expiration. 

21

And to the extent a licensee has to pay higher  charge 

22

higher prices because it has to make the license 

23

payments, that's an open invitation to people to enter. 

24
25

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

It may be, but the 

licensee 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And those people are

2

not inhibited by the patent because the patent term 

3

has  was limited to the 20 years specified by 

4

Congress. 

5

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

The  the licensee though 

6

is  may be in the best position to be engaging in that 

7

followon innovation and indeed, the same thing could 

8

have been said about this Court's decision in Scott 

9

Paper or even in Lear v. Adkins before BlonderTongue, 

10

which you would say, well, that person is the only 

11

person who is on the hook and they may continue paying, 

12

but the rest of the public could practice the expired 

13

patent in Scott Paper.  Or the rest of the public could 

14

bring their own invalidity challenge 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I suppose there 

16

would be barriers to entry in particular cases and 

17

perhaps those are situations in which the rule of reason 

18

could be applied.  But otherwise, in a competitive 

19

economy, the idea that you know exactly what you have to 

20

do to make a product and this other person is selling 

21

it, you know, for $2 a widget more than you can, that 

22

seems to me to be a powerful incentive for  for entry. 

23

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

It may be an incentive for 

24

entry, but it still conflicts with the long line of 

25

cases recognizing the patent policy interest in a 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

completely free public domain and the issue that is

2

established in Scott Paper.  This  Brulotte followed 

3

very logically from Scott Paper, which is that we are 

4

not indifferent to the individual licensee.  When that 

5

licensee ties their hands and obligates themselves to 

6

that ongoing royalty obligation, that in turn is 

7

affected by the public interest.  And so Scott Paper 

8

it was no accident that the courts of appeals were all 

9

reaching the same result as Brulotte based on the 

10

authority of Scott Paper, which Petitioners have not 

11

asked this Court to overrule. 

12

 So I think that although there  there can 

13

be nuanced economic arguments when we look at this in 

14

the antitrust frame, we may be talking about market 

15

entry in some situations and not in others.  That wasn't 

16

the way that Brulotte was approaching the question.  And 

17

that if you move solely to a rule of reason analysis, 

18

all you're offering is a remedy that's already 

19

available.  There could already be an antitrust suit in 

20

this case.  So it effectively eliminates any separate 

21

patentbased doctrine in this area. 

22
23
24
25

 And that is a big step that affects the 
balance 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that's an 

interesting issue because I agree with you, that I don't 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

know why we need an antitrust test that already exists

2

with respect to any patent and its use after its 

3

expiration date.  But what do we substitute it with? 

4

Meaning, you  you're saying a patentbased system.  So 

5

if we're thinking of substituting it, how would you do 

6

it? 

7
8
9

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

Well, it's not  it's not a 

substitution.  It's that the Brulotte rule 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, it has  the 

10

Brulotte rule was to ensure no patent owner extended its 

11

 its monopoly against the licensee.  That the 

12

licensee, like the general public, should be free to use 

13

the patent.  So what do we say to keep that up without 

14

using the rule of reason? 

15
16

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

Well, it's free  that 

they're free to use the patent 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

Yes. 
 and that to charge 

19

royalties for that is  is  it conflicts with that 

20

policy because it's affecting their decisionmaking. 

21

It's an ongoing marginal cost and I think that it's very 

22

artificial to drive this  this wedge between the right 

23

to exclude and royalties.  The patent right is a bundle 

24

of rights.  You can have a right to exclude, you could 

25

push everyone out of the market and practice yourself. 

Alderson Reporting Company

 As a practical matter, the real value of the

2

vast majority of patents, particularly after eBay where 

3

you may not get injunctive relief, is the statutory 

4

right to damages.  Damages defined in Section 284 as

being, at a minimum, a reasonable royalty. 

6

 So you have a system set up in which one of 

7

the sticks in that bundle of rights being given to you 

8

by Congress for that limited term is your right to 

9

engage in royalties. 

10
11
12

 And so I don't think we can drive this 
artificial wedge between 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I know you don't 

13

want us to.  But let's assume someone wants to, that we 

14

think Brulotte was wrong economically.  We buy the 

15

arguments of the other side, that it hurts the market. 

16

How would you substitute?  How would you think you would 

17

protect your interest without using the rule of reason? 

18

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

Without  I mean, if we are 

19

talking about fallbacks and I assume the question is 

20

assuming that we've gotten past stare decisis. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

Exactly. 
Then I think that, at a  a 

23

minimum, you need to have what we have discussed as 

24

being a presumption against this practice.  And if there 

25

are specific instances in which someone can come in and 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

show that this comports with patent policy, and this is

2

going to be proinnovative, then they can litigate that. 

3

 But I think to go to Justice Breyer's 

4

points, you're  you're talking about, on one hand, as 

5

Justice Kagan's questions are eliciting, very 

6

speculative and uncertain harm, given the flexibility 

7

that's already allowed to amortize payments under 

8

Brulotte; and, on the other hand, the certainty and 

9

expense of a very difficult to apply legal regime. 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If you  but 

11

amortizing the payments under Brulotte is very 

12

restrictive.  What you're saying, those payments have to 

13

be related in some sense to the patent period, you 

14

cannot take into account events after that.  And yet I 

15

would think one of the risks are, well, maybe we'll be 

16

able to turn this invention into something or maybe we 

17

won't, and so we have to give, you know, license fees 

18

that take that contingency into account.  But you can't 

19

do that under Brulotte, because that can only refer to 

20

the period that's left on the patent. 

21

 MR. SAUNDERS: 

Right.  Under Brulotte, you 

22

have  you have 20 years in which you can do absolutely 

23

anything, can account for all  all of your risks in 

24

that period in terms of whether the product is taken 

25

off.  And what you can't do under Brulotte is say, if 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

the success, if  if this is accruing on use after that

2

20year period, then we're going to be capturing that. 

3

But I think that  that crystallizes the problem, the 

4

conflict between Petitioner's position and the patent 

5

policy here, because what you're saying really saying 

6

is, my invention is such that 20 years isn't long enough 

7

for me, it's not going to realize a success until after 

8

the 20year period. 

9

 The fact that you may not be able to capture 

10

that is a direct consequence of the decision Congress 

11

made when it set the patent term.  And, in fact, for the 

12

concerns that are raised by particular industries, 

13

those  those are concerns that Congress has not been 

14

deaf to it  to them.  It passed the HatchWaxman Act 

15

in 1984 specifically targeted to the pharmaceutical 

16

context.  People had concerns about patent life being 

17

consumed during patent examination.  Congress came back 

18

in 1999, and set up a series of patent term adjustments 

19

to compensate for that. 

20

 And if there are any industryspecific 

21

concerns, given the complexity of the economics here, 

22

given the disputes that we're having about the reliance 

23

interest, this is quintessentially a task for Congress 

24

to weigh at this point, particularly since we're talking 

25

about a rule that has stood for 50 years, and during 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

that time, has become part of the fabric of the law.

2

 If this Court has other questions?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM STEWART 

6
7
8
9
10

Thank you, counsel. 

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 
 SUPPORTING RESPONDENT 
 MR. STEWART: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 This Court's decision in Brulotte is not an 

11

outlier, but instead fits comfortably within a 

12

substantial body of decisions that recognize a strong 

13

Patent Act policy favoring unrestricted public access to 

14

unpatented and previously patented inventions, and these 

15

cases fall into two basic categories. 

16

 The  the first is cases like Bonito Boats, 

17

Compco, Sears Roebuck, where the Court held to be 

18

preempted State laws that would provide patentlike 

19

protection to inventions that either were not patentable 

20

under Federal law or inventions as to which a Federal 

21

patent had expired.  And typically, those State laws 

22

that were held to be preempted took the form of 

23

prohibitions on the copying of products that were 

24

already in  in the market.  And  and the Court in 

25

those decisions didn't apply anything that looked like 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

rule of reason analysis.  It really didn't apply

2

economic analysis at all. 

3

 It didn't purport to say that the economy 

4

would be worse off if these laws were allowed to be 

5

enforced.  It simply said those laws are inconsistent 

6

with the balance that Congress has struck, both between 

7

what is patentable and what is unpatentable, and the 

8

balance that Congress has struck as to what the length 

9

of patent protection should be. 

10

 And the Court could have drawn a sharp 

11

distinction between prescriptive State laws and private 

12

contractual arrangements, but it didn't. 

13

 And I think in addition to Brulotte, the two 

14

cases that I would point to that fall into the second 

15

category are the cases that Mr. Saunders has mentioned, 

16

Scott Paper and Lear.  In Scott Paper, the Court said 

17

that if even a single licensee was allowed to enter into 

18

a binding restriction on his use of the patented 

19

invention after the patent expires, the consuming public 

20

would be deprived of full unrestricted access to the 

21

patented invention. 

22

 And  and two points there are crucial. 

23

The first is the Court recognized that even though the 

24

restriction that was sought to be applied in Sears would 

25

bind only a single person, would  wouldn't prevent 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

others from using the patented invention after the

2

patent expires.  Nevertheless, that was regarded as a 

3

restriction inconsistent with Federal patent policy. 

4

And the Court explained that was so in part because when 

5

a single licensee is restricted in his ability to use 

6

the formerly patented invention, it's not only he who 

7

suffers; it's the consuming public who could otherwise 

8

hope to buy the products that he manufactures. 

9

 And  and the second case is Lear, where 

10

the Court held after Brulotte that even when the  a 

11

licensee has entered into a contractual promise not to 

12

challenge the patent and to continue to pay royalties 

13

during the pendency of any challenge that may arise, the 

14

licensee can repudiate the license, can challenge the 

15

patent itself, can cease paying royalties.  Obviously, 

16

it take  the licensee, in that circumstance, takes the 

17

chance that it may have to pay damages if the patent is 

18

held to be valid  if the patent is held to be valid. 

19

But if a licensee is correct, if the patent is invalid, 

20

its contractual arrangement will not prevent it 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Stewart, do you take 

22

issue at all with the economic theory of all of the 

23

amici that have filed in the antitrust area saying this 

24

makes no sense 

25

 MR. STEWART: 

I  I 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

2

 MR. STEWART: 

 economically?
I'd say three  we  we do 

3

take issue to some extent, because at least some of the 

4

criticisms are based on the misconception that Brulotte 

5

prohibits extending royalty payments out past the date 

6

of patent expiration, and Brulotte properly understood, 

7

as the Petitioners recognize, prohibits royalties that 

8

accrue based on postexpiration use, but it doesn't 

9

prohibit the postexpiration payments of royalties that 

10

are calculated based on use during the patent.  So to 

11

to that extent, we do disagree. 

12

 We  I think also, a lot of the antitrust 

13

criticism has been to the effect that  and  and we 

14

agree with this as far as it goes  that viewed as a 

15

matter of modern antitrust law, a  a per se rule of 

16

illegality would not be warranted because the per se 

17

rule is reserved for situations in which rule of reason 

18

analysis would always or almost always condemn the 

19

practice. 

20

 And so if a particular practice is 

21

procompetitive and even of significant range of cases, 

22

it should be analyzed under the rule of reason for 

23

antitrust purposes, and  and we don't disagree with 

24

the  the critique that Brulotte  the Brulotte rule 

25

would not be a sound one of antitrust policy. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

 But even to say rule of reason should be

2

applied because this is not always anticompetitive is 

3

not going as far as saying that, on balance, the 

4

Brulotte rule causes more economic harm than benefit. 

5

I  we don't  I don't know to what extent the 

6

economists have really made that case.  We don't think 

7

it's been proved one way or the other.  It seems to us 

8

to be a criticism that  that's much more soundly 

9

directed at  at  to  to Congress. 

10
11
12

 That the other thing that I would say 
about 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  What  what 

13

benefit do  do you see coming from the rule?  I mean, 

14

if you're just analyzing it, you know, economically as 

15

we would do for antitrust analysis 

16

 MR. STEWART: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18
19

The 
 what  what are the 

economic benefits of the rule? 
 MR. STEWART: 

Arrangements like the ones at 

20

issue here can cause economic harm in the sense that 

21

they prevent the licensee from making unrestricted use 

22

of the product after the license expires.  The licensee 

23

may, in certain circumstances, determine that it's 

24

it's not feasible to sell the thing at a profit if it 

25

has to pay the royalties.  At the very least, it will 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

presumably bake the royalties into the price it charges

2

to consumers. 

3

 Now, there  there is an argument on the 

4

other side, this is more than made up for by the fact 

5

that the licensee will presumably be charged less while 

6

the patent is in force. 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That  they are the harms. 

What  what are the benefits? 
 MR. STEWART: 

The benefits in  in terms of 

10

economics are that the licensee or after the  the 

11

patent expires can make decisions about whether to 

12

exploit the invention, what sort of followon products 

13

to devise that may incorporate the patented invention 

14

without any disincentive created by the obligation to 

15

pay royalties. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

In a word, you have a 

17

higher price after the 20 years is up, and a higher 

18

price means a restricted output. 

19

 MR. STEWART: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MR. STEWART: 

22

 But I  I think the other point I would 

That's correct. 
Any other antitrust 
That's correct. 

23

make is, and I  I take your point, Mr. Chief Justice, 

24

that the 1960s are often associated with loose economic 

25

analysis, but I think  I think Brulotte not only was 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

not an antitrust decision.  I think, for better or

2

worse, the Court really didn't rely on economic analysis 

3

of any sort.  That is, it said the balance that Congress 

4

struck was that during the period when the patent is in 

5

force, you can basically charge whatever royalties the 

6

market will bear; after the patent expires, the 

7

invention is supposed to be available for free, 

8

unrestricted use for the public, and you can't trade one 

9

for the other. 

10

 It's essentially the same mode of reasoning 

11

that the Court used in cases like Bonito Boats and  Sears 

12

Roebuck.  The  the analysis was not  although it 

13

might or might have not have been true, this will cause 

14

economic harm to allow States to restrict copying in 

15

this manner, the argument was simply this is not the 

16

balance that Congress has struck. 

17

 And I wanted to return to  to 

18

Lear for a second because this was a case in which the 

19

Court applied the same basic mode of reasoning to a 

20

private contractual arrangement; that is, the Court 

21

recognized in Lear that the agreement potentially bound 

22

only the licensee; that is, any other member of the 

23

public could have challenged the validity of the patent. 

24

But as Mr. Saunders said, the Court pointed out that the 

25

licensee may often be in the best position both because 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

it has knowledge of the patent's workings and because it

2

has the economic incentive to try to escape the royalty 

3

obligation.  The licensee may be in the best position to 

4

challenge the validity of the patent, and therefore, a 

5

restriction that binds only the licensee is less 

6

sweeping than one that binds the  the whole State or 

7

the whole country, but it's still not just like a 

8

restriction on a randomly selected individual. 

9

 I guess the  the other thing I would say 

10

about the  the SloanKettering brief and the argument 

11

that is made there is that undoubtedly, the Brulotte 

12

rule sometimes prevents contracting parties from 

13

agreeing to the precise mix of burdens and benefits that 

14

they would prefer.  But there's really been no evidence 

15

that the effect of the Brulotte rule is to prevent these 

16

agreements from being formed at all as opposed to their 

17

being  causing them to be formed on terms that are 

18

somewhat suboptimal from the  the standpoint of the 

19

contracting parties.  That  the second thing we would 

20

say is to the extent that there's a  evidence to show 

21

real substantial harm in terms of impairment of 

22

licensing agreements, again, that evidence is better 

23

considered and evaluated by Congress. 

24

 The  the other thing I would say is that 

25

the situation in which the SloanKettering brief is 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

is most clearly directed at is one in which it's

2

necessary to do substantial nonremunerative work as a 

3

preliminary matter during the period while the patent is 

4

in force in order to be able to monetize the invention 

5

down the road.  And that's why they say, well, use 

6

during the period while the patent is in force is not a 

7

real sound estimate of the value of being able to 

8

exploit the patent.  But those are precisely the cases 

9

in which it's most likely that after patent expiration, 

10

competitors will face barriers to entry.  I mean, to say 

11

that you need to do a lot of preliminary work before you 

12

can make money is to say that people who haven't done 

13

the preliminary work may face difficulties in  in 

14

becoming competitors.  And so on the one hand, that's a 

15

situation where the licensees might prefer not to have 

16

the Brulotte rule in place, but it's also a situation in 

17

which a burden on the licensee is most substantial. 

18

 If there are no further questions.

25

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

dealing with here is a per se rule.  Petitioners are not 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47

asking this Court to shift to a regime where patent

2

royalties are  on postexpiration use are always 

3

permissible.  Petitioners are asking this Court to lift 

4

a barrier  a per se barrier against these royalty 

5

arrangements. 

6

 And under this Court's precedent 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Would that  would that 

8

rule of reason be a patent rule or a  an antitrust 

9

rule? 

10

 MR. MELNIK: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I think 
And if a patent rule, where 

12

does it come from?  Where  where is it in the patent 

13

statutes? 

14

 MR. MELNIK: 

Well, Justice Scalia, patent 

15

misuse, when it initially originated, wasn't in the 

16

patent statutes either.  It didn't appear in  in the 

17

narrow sense until the 1952 act when Congress acted to 

18

overrule certain decisions of this Court.  So the  as 

19

the law stands today, the rule of reason is the standard 

20

that the Federal circuit uses to assess patent misuse. 

21

 So where does it exist today? 

It exists in 

22

the Federal circuit's case law on patent misuse.  So 

23

the  the question I think that needs to be asked is 

24

even if you  even if you view it as solely an 

25

antitrust rule, which it  which it's not on the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

current state of the law because of the Federal

2

circuit's case law.  The question then needs to be asked 

3

is:  What patent policy exists that would justify some 

4

rule beyond the rule of reason?  And I would submit that 

5

neither the government nor Respondents have demonstrated 

6

any patent policy that is not at its core an economic 

7

policy.  If you look  take a close look at 

8

Respondent's patent policy argument, it ultimately 

9

reduces to a question of prices and outputs in the 

10

postexpiration period versus preexpiration period, and 

11

that is essentially an economic question. 

12

 But to follow up on  on something that 

13

Justice Sotomayor earlier said, Petitioners would be 

14

content with an alternative that draws on this Court's 

15

Zenith decision and a  a test that focused on coercion 

16

as an alternative to a rule of reason analysis.  I think 

17

either would be appropriate. 

18

 If the Court has no more questions. 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

20
