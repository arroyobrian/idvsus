Mr. Colombo.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRY J. COLOMBO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. COLOMBO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The California Supreme Court's denial of

12

Respondent's ineffective counsel claim was entitled to

13

the deferential review for reasonableness prescribed by

14

28 U.S.C. section 2254(d).

15

in 2254(d) requires a State court to render a reasoned

16

or explained decision, nor is there anything in section

17

2254(d) that would treat Strickland claims differently

18

from any other Federal constitutional claim.

19

By its plain terms, nothing

Here, the Ninth Circuit failed to give the

20

State court decision the proper deference -- indeed,

21

double deference -- it was owed.

22

this Court's proper -- excuse me -- clearly established

23

Strickland standard, the court of appeals employed its

24

own eccentric rule that essentially requires counsel to

25

always consult with and present expert testimony in

Rather than applying

every case in which the prosecution -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do -- how do we know

3

that the -- the California court even reached that

4

question?

5

deny review as -- as -- wasn't there a time bar question

6

raised?

7

Because there was -- wasn't there a motion to

MR. COLOMBO:

There was a procedural bar

8

that was argued in the informal opposition to the

9

petition for writ of habeas corpus that had been

10

requested by the California Supreme Court.

11

invoke that bar as a basis for denying relief.

12

well-established -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

just said denied on -- on the merits.

15

not clear to me how to -- pardon me.

16

"denied"?
MR. COLOMBO:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under

Of course, it said -- it

14

17

It did not

And it's still
It just said

Yes.
It's still not clear to me

19

how to distinguish that, between denied, deny -- do we

20

say, when there's a one-line order, as in this case,

21

where it says simply "deny," it is presumptively on the

22

merits?

23

I mean, how -- how do we interpret that?
MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

In fact, that is a

24

well-settled and long-established practice, local

25

practice.

It's well-understood by not only the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

litigants, but the State and Federal courts of the Ninth

2

Circuit, dating back to the Ninth Circuit's 1974

3

decision in Harris v. Superior Court.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
on the merits?

MR. COLOMBO:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

formulation.

10

Then it is presumptively

Yes.
They don't -- I mean, is

Don't let me use my

What's -- what's the State's formulation?
MR. COLOMBO:

The State's formulation is

11

that the silent or so-called summary denial is on the

12

merits, unless the State court indicates otherwise in -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, that can't be a Ninth

14

Circuit rule.

15

each of the States in the Ninth Circuit, no?

16

I mean, that has to depend upon each -

I mean, some State could -- could have a

17

different rule, I assume.

18

however, that California has that rule?

19
20

MR. COLOMBO:

You're -- you're telling us,

Yes.

And that rule, again,

has been well-established -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But did -
But if I'm on the

23

California court and I have two choices -- one is to say

24

denied, no explanation, as this case; the other is to

25

say denied on the merits -- if I have those two options,
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then why are they both on the merits?

2

MR. COLOMBO:

Again, because it has

3

certainly been well-understood for at least three and a

4

half decades that when the California Supreme Court

5

renders a so-called silent denial, that it is on the

6

merits unless the court ordered -

7
8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

California authority on that proposition?

9
10

MR. COLOMBO:

13
14

That would be In re Robbins,

in which -

11
12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. COLOMBO:

brief, as well as in the reply brief.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. COLOMBO:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Thank you.

Counsel, I don't know

that you answered Justice Kennedy's question.

18

20

That's the Robbins case.

Okay.

15

17

And what is the leading

I'm sorry.
I don't know you

answered his question.
His question was:

If you can deny or deny

on the merits, what's the difference between the two?
MR. COLOMBO:

There really is no

substantive -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's two choices, so

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they have to have different meanings in some way.

2

MR. COLOMBO:

I would submit that there is

3

no substantive distinction between an order that simply

4

reflects denied versus one that reflects denied on the

5

merits.

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They showed us the

docket for that day -

8

MR. COLOMBO:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- of the denial here,

10

and there were different ones.

If it's the same court

11

taking action, why would they choose one over the other

12

for particular cases?

13

MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

Well, I submit that there

14

could be any number of reasons, and not the least of

15

which this Court addressed itself in Carey v. Saffold,

16

just a couple of terms ago.

17

As the Court recognized, that sometimes the

18

State court may choose to include the phrase "on the

19

merits" to give a reviewing court an alternative basis

20

for understanding why relief was denied, or to let, for

21

example, a pro se petitioner, who are typically the ones

22

that present petitions for writs of habeas corpus in the

23

California Supreme Court, know that their case wasn't

24

denied because of some mere procedural technicality, but

25

because the claim itself was substantively meritless.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's what -

2

that's feeding into your adversary's argument, that when

3

the court does a summary denial, you don't know whether

4

it's procedural or merits.

5
6

That's his argument.

You're adopting his

argument?

7

MR. COLOMBO:

No.

No.

Our argument is that

8

it's a long-settled, established question of local

9

practice that when the California Supreme Court renders

10

a -- a silent denial, simply says "petition for writ of

11

habeas corpus denied," it is understood by the court's

12

litigants, has been well-established for over three and

13

a half decades:

14

That is a merits decision.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what would the

15

California Supreme Court do if they all agree that this

16

application should be denied, but two of them think it's

17

for a procedural bar -- timeliness -- and then others

18

think it has no merit, and they say just "denied," but

19

there's no majority for either one?

20

MR. COLOMBO:

In -- in that instance, then

21

the claim would be presumed -- assuming that the court's

22

order simply reflected "petition denied," again, it's

23

well understood that that would be a denial on the

24

merits.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though, in fact, it

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

wasn't?
MR. COLOMBO:

Well, we can't know that.

3

fact, it would be purely speculative to suggest that

4

that's what the courts have done.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In

So we -- so there is that

6

possibility -- even though there is that possibility, we

7

should assume it was on the merits.

8
9

What about -- I mean, you said this is three
decades, but we are told that the California Supreme

10

Court has this pattern of saying merits when it's on the

11

merits; giving a citation, if it's a procedural bar to

12

the -- a procedural fault; and when it says simply

13

"denied," that's most likely that they couldn't all

14

agree on a reason.

15

MR. COLOMBO:

Well, I would respectfully

16

disagree with that suggestion, that because it simply

17

says "denied" without including the phrase "on the

18

merits," it's not a merits determination.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

But that's what they

would say if, in fact, they were divided, right?

21

MR. COLOMBO:

I'm sorry.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What?

If, in fact, the court

23

was divided, all agree that the petition should be

24

denied, but there's no majority for any particular

25

reason, merits or procedure, they -- they would say
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

"petition denied," right?
MR. COLOMBO:

Yes, if it's -- if it's a

3

straight silent denial, and the -- the court doesn't

4

invoke either a procedural bar to deny relief or forgo

5

the procedural bar and find that the claims are

6

substantively meritless in any event.

7

What I submit that the silent denial simply

8

means is the court didn't agree that there was a basis

9

for invoking a procedural bar; the claims were

10

meritless, and it simply orders the petition denied,

11

which is, again, well-understood.

12

well-established practice in the -- in the State and

13

Federal courts in California that those silent denials

14

are merits determinations, which are entitled, then, to

15

AEDPA deference under the statute.

16

It's a

Even the Ninth Circuit, in the en banc

17

decision in this case, recognized that the California

18

Supreme Court's silent denial was a merits determination

19

which it then had to review.

20
21
22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do -- does the court

sometimes deny explicitly on procedural grounds?
MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

And when the court does

23

that, it will reflect such in its orders.

24

discussed in footnote 34 in the Robbins case, which we

25

discuss in our brief in this Court.
10

Alderson Reporting Company

That's

Official

1

The court says when it's going to invoke as

2

a basis for denying relief on a Federal claim, it will

3

indicate that in its order.

4

separate State procedural default, for example, if it's

5

a successive petition of the claimant's previously

6

raised on direct appeal or -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If it's relying on a

So you're saying that if

8

it's on both grounds, if they agree with both the

9

procedural and the merits ground, they may well just -

10

just deny without any explanation?

11

only on the procedural ground, they will -- they will

12

say it?

13

MR. COLOMBO:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if they deny

Yes.
All right.
If you looked back at a

16

sample of the cases in which they have simply said

17

"denied," would we find cases in which no procedural bar

18

was raised by the State?

19

MR. COLOMBO:

I don't know the answer to

20

that question, because I haven't researched to find out

21

whether or not in any of those cases, like in this case,

22

the California Supreme Court directed the Attorney

23

General to file an informal opposition or some other

24

pleading that would have addressed that question.

25

Without knowing whether or not there was briefing on
11

suggestion in Respondent's brief that that was done, I

JUSTICE BREYER:

issue in this case before the California Supreme Court?

6

MR. COLOMBO:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. COLOMBO:

9

12

Yes.
What was that?

A timeliness bar, among

others.

10
11

Was there a procedural

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What was the basis of

that?
MR. COLOMBO:

That the claim of ineffective

13

assistance could and should have been discovered at an

14

earlier time than when it was presented to the

15

California Supreme Court under California's timeliness

16

rule, which would require that counsel present the claim

17

of, in this case, ineffective assistance upon learning

18

of the factual basis to support such a claim.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it took 14 months for

20

this petition to be filed to the State court.

21

have cases that show whether those 14 months are

22

presumptively unreasonable under California law?

23
24
25

MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

Do you

And that's basically the

Clark case that's also discussed in our brief.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So there is great

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

validity, you think, to your timeliness -- so this

2

timeliness claim.

3

silent denial was an adjudication on the merits.

4

And despite that, you believe the

MR. COLOMBO:

Yes, because I would submit

5

that when the State argued that the claim was

6

procedurally barred by reason of untimeliness and the

7

State court did not invoke that as a bar to relief, it

8

necessarily concluded that the claims were

9

unmeritorious, because they otherwise could have been

10

barred by a procedural bar, but they -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought you just told me

12

that if they -- if they agreed both with the procedural

13

ground and the merits ground, they could issue just -

14

just a denial without explanation.

15

MR. COLOMBO:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

That's -
Now you're telling me

that -- the opposite.

18

MR. COLOMBO:

If I said that, then I

19

misspoke or perhaps I misunderstood the Court's

20

question.

21

What I'm suggesting is if the court invokes

22

as a basis for denying a Federal claim a State

23

procedural bar, it will reflect that in its order.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That will always be in the

order.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if, in this case, they

3

did reject it on a procedural ground, and it was a

4

reasonable ground that they applied consistently, then

5

the Ninth Circuit or the Federal courts couldn't

6

consider the claim at all; is that right?

7
8

MR. COLOMBO:

That's correct, assuming that

the Federal courts agreed that the State bar wasn't -

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

If, in fact, the -- they

10

are right, if in fact that the State was correct that

11

this is procedurally barred -- they should have raised

12

it earlier; they didn't -- and if that was correct and

13

reasonable and proper under both Federal and State law,

14

then you shouldn't be in this subject at all; is that

15

right or not?

16

MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.

Yes.

So, normally, to decide a

18

matter on a substantive -- to have a presumption that

19

they were deciding it substantively rather than

20

procedurally will help a defendant, though not in this

21

case.

22

MR. COLOMBO:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24
25

That's correct.
But you didn't raise -- you

haven't argued that it's procedurally barred.
MR. COLOMBO:

Not in the Federal court, no.
14


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

So you may have waived that.

2

On the other hand, your opponent has, as I gather, until

3

they got here, never argued that it was based on

4

anything other than the merits.

5

waived that.

6

MR. COLOMBO:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8
9
10

Yes.

So they might have

I would submit that -

So everything might be

waived here.
(Laughter.)
MR. COLOMBO:

Well, I'm not sure that -- we

11

never invoked a procedural bar in the Federal court

12

insofar as the presentation of these particular claims.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One thing that's not

14

waived is the second question, or the first, which is

15

the merits of the Strickland claim.

16

MR. COLOMBO:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18
19
20
21

Yes.
And maybe this would

be a good point for you to switch to that.
MR. COLOMBO:

I would -- I would be pleased

to discuss that with the Court.
We have argued in our brief, and I think

22

it's crystal clear:

First of all, the Ninth Circuit's

23

grossly overbroad explication of a so-called Strickland

24

standard that would require counsel in every case in

25

which the prosecution presents forensic -
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. COLOMBO:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

Did they say that?

I'm sorry.
Did they explicitly say

in every single case you have to consult an expert?

5

MR. COLOMBO:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

They didn't say that.
Or did they say, in the

7

circumstances of this case, given the nature of the

8

issues, that consultation would have been effective?

9

MR. COLOMBO:

That is -- that certainly is

10

one reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion.

11

that the more correct reading, so to speak, would be if

12

the Court looks at the language that the Ninth Circuit

13

uses in -- in discussing this standard, they essentially

14

say, since counsel should have reasonably expected the

15

prosecution was going to present this forensic evidence,

16

he should have not only investigated it, he should have

17

consulted with experts.

18

And I think -

19

I submit

He should have presented them.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We could take issue with

20

-- with the timing of that consultation, but let's

21

assume that it turns out afterwards that if he had

22

consulted an expert, that that expert would have told

23

him that one of those blood spots absolutely had to be

24

Klein's near the bedroom.

25

with saying it would have been ineffective for that

You would have no quarrel

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

counsel to have failed to confer with an expert,

2

wouldn't you?

3
4

MR. COLOMBO:

No, I would disagree with that

for the reasons -

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You would say, even if

6

the expert were to give that kind -- an expert would

7

have given that kind of exculpatory information, that

8

that would not have been ineffective?

9

MR. COLOMBO:

Let me start by saying this:

10

First of all, we can't know and no one can ever know

11

that Klein's, or Johnson's blood, for that matter, was

12

in this blood pool that the Ninth Circuit -

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not talking -

14

MR. COLOMBO: -- focused its attention on.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I gave you a

16

hypothetical different from the facts of this case.

17

take the Ninth Circuit to be saying, if you're in an

18

area, and you are a lawyer, where you have no expertise

19

and your case depends on a technical issue, it behooves

20

you to at least talk to an expert to find out if you are

21

on the right track.

22

something that's completely exculpatory, you're

23

ineffective.

24
25

I

And if you fail to and you get

So I posed the hypothetical:

If an expert

would have looked at all of these test results and said,
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that has to be Klein's blood there, it can't be

2

Johnson's for this reason, you are positing that even

3

under that circumstance there would not have been

4

ineffectiveness for the failure to consult with an

5

expert?

Is that what you are telling us?

6

MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

And the reason why I say

7

that is because it's important to remember that the

8

critical forensic evidence in this case, that the jury

9

was -

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You keep wanting to

11

return to this case, and I respect why you want to, but

12

I am positing a hypothetical that underlies, I think,

13

the Ninth Circuit's point.

14

MR. COLOMBO:

In response -

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It may well be in this

16

case that the consultation would have resulted in no

17

prejudice.

18

effective to ignore a consultation.

19

different questions.

20

That's different from whether it was

MR. COLOMBO:

Those are two

I suppose, accepting the

21

Court's hypothetical as stated, that counsel was aware

22

of and failed to consult with an expert knowing that

23

that testimony would be presented, could be deemed

24

deficient performance under -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- do you think it

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

makes a difference whether the expert would have -

2

would have helped or not?

3

that decision of whether to call an expert ex ante, not

4

ex post.

5

decision on the basis of whether, even if it's a

6

1,000-to-1 long shot, it turns out that that testimony

7

would have been very successful.

8
9

I mean, counsel has to make

I mean, you -- we shouldn't evaluate his

Don't we have to examine it ex ante before
he knows what the result will be?

10

MR. COLOMBO:

Yes, and I think it's

11

important to look at -- as this Court has described in

12

the Strickland case itself, we have to view from

13

counsel's perspective at that time.

14

What could he have reasonably expected the prosecution's

15

evidence to be?

16

What tactical or strategic choices -

17

What did he know?

How is he going to meet that evidence?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, Justice Sotomayor's

18

hypothetical would include the situation where he

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Colombo -

Unless the -- sorry.
Mr. Colombo, you -- you

12

say in any event, leaving aside the question of whether

13

there was ineffective assistance of counsel, even

14

assuming there was, there would -- there would be no

15

prejudice in this case.

16

MR. COLOMBO:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18
19

That's correct.

Yes.

And could you just

summarize why you say there would be no prejudice?
MR. COLOMBO:

Well, first of all, I think

20

it's important to recognize that the expert declarations

21

that were proffered by Respondent in support of his

22

habeas petition really don't challenge the testimony

23

that was presented in the State trial by the State's

24

experts, specifically the question of whether or not the

25

murder victim could have been moved from, supposedly,
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the area outside the bedroom door onto the couch.
The testimony at trial suggested that that

3

distance was somewhere between about 20 and 25 feet.

4

There was no evidence at the crime scene that suggested

5

the victim had moved from the point where he was shot

6

with a fatal gunshot wound.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the -- the

8

pool of blood?

9

something about -- that Johnson, standing up, could not

10
11

There was one expert affidavit that said

have produced that amount of blood.
MR. COLOMBO:

I think the actual expert

12

declaration suggested that the prosecution's theory, as

13

the expert described it, could be eliminated, because

14

Johnson could not have bled into the blood pool

15

sufficient to have formed it by merely standing and

16

waiting for the police to arrive.

17

I think it's important to realize the

18

distinction between the prosecutor's theory which he

19

propounded in his closing argument versus the evidence

20

that the jury actually heard at trial from the State's

21

own blood-spatter expert that suggested in order for -

22

for Klein to have been moved from the point where the

23

blood pool had formed onto the couch where his body was

24

discovered by the police, there would have been some

25

trail or some indicia, some evidence that would have
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

suggested that he had to have been moved from that

2

point.

3

And the more important question, I suppose,

4

would be, as the dissenting opinion pointed out in this

5

case:

6

been shot at that location?

7

moved onto the couch?

8
9

Why would the victim have been moved if he had
Why would he have been

It certainly makes no sense for another
victim, who's already shot, who's intoxicated, who's

10

wounded and moving around in the house -- why would he

11

have wanted to have moved the victim of the gunshot

12

wound to the head from point A to point B?

13

doesn't make any sense.

14

anything in any of Respondent's experts' declarations

15

that suggests a rational explanation for how or why that

16

could have happened.

17

It just

And there has never been

Without -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On the -- on the no

18

prejudice issue, are you relying just on what

19

happened -- what was found at the scene of the crime?

20

mean, you said it's implausible that Klein would have

21

been moved with no trail of blood at all.

22

therefore no prejudice.

23
24
25

So, you say,

Any -- anything else that goes into your no
prejudice argument?
MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

I think for all of the

23

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

reasons that are discussed in the dissenting opinion at

2

pages 193a to 194a of the petition for writ of

3

certiorari -- excuse me -- of the appendix.

4

As the dissenting opinion points out, it

5

certainly was -- there's no evidence in the various

6

experts' declarations that suggests, first of all, why

7

the jury would have believed Respondent's trial

8

testimony that after having essentially partied with the

9

two victims for several hours the night before, they

10

suddenly leave, go back to their place of employment,

11

come back two hours later to return property and a

12

firearm to another occupant of the house that they had

13

no reason to believe was actually there; then they are

14

suddenly surprised by these two victims; that there is a

15

spontaneous gunfight that ensues involving a firearm

16

that's never found, that's never attributed to either of

17

the two victims in the house, that could have only been

18

attributable to the Respondent himself.

19

So the jury had all of that evidence to

20

consider, and we balance that against these -- as I,

21

again, described them -- inconclusive and speculative

22

expert opinions that are proffered in support of

23

Respondent's habeas petition.

24

been persuaded to find the defendant not guilty, even

25

had that evidence been introduced.

The jury could not have

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So, necessarily, Petitioner could -

2

Respondent could not have been prejudiced by the failure

3

to introduce that evidence, assuming that that evidence

4

was, in fact, available and could have been presented in

5

this case at the time of Respondent's trial.

6
7
8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Was there additional

physical evidence found not at the scene?
MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

In fact, the -- the

other thing that really tied the Respondent into this

10

crime was that there was an expended casing at the crime

11

scene that matched perfectly with a loaded firearm

12

magazine with the exact same kind of bullets and a box

13

full of the same exact bullets in the Respondent's house

14

when the officer served a search warrant, along with the

15

stolen gun safe and some evidence that there was

16

marijuana there, which the victim -- the surviving

17

victim was -- admitted to be a marijuana dealer.

18
19
20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I ask you a question

about California procedure?
Is what happened here unusual?

Is there -

21

doesn't -- does the prosecution have an obligation to

22

provide notice before trial of its intention to call

23

expert witnesses?

24
25

MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

Under California

discovery rules, the prosecution would have to disclose
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to the defense any evidence it intends to introduce,

2

either by way of lay testimony or expert testimony,

3

before the trial commences.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if the defendant

5

requests that, does -- what's the defendant's reciprocal

6

obligation, if any?

7

MR. COLOMBO:

The defendant would have to

8

disclose any witnesses that he or she intends to

9

introduce at trial, including expert testimony and any

10

reports supporting such experts.

Unless the Court has any further questions,
I'd like to reserve my remaining time.

absence of blood between the blood pool and the couch.

Detective Bell testified to that.

13

pages 181 and 195 in the reporter's transcript in

14

15

there were drops leading away from the couch; yes, there

16

were drops leading away from the blood pool.

17

That

If you look at

And in fact, Exhibit R5 is a picture of the
couch, and you can indeed see -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

was that there was no trail from the bed.

theory was that Klein was removed from the bed to the

MR. GARDNER:

Indeed.

But the State's

4

theory -- the defense theory was that the body had been

5

moved from the blood pool -- not the bed -- the blood

pool to the couch.

7

briefing and today at oral argument, was that there was

no blood trail between the blood pool and the couch.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so the idea is

15

that Johnson drags Klein.

16

Because you are not suggesting he could have lifted

17

Klein and walked him over, are you?

18

20
21

MR. GARDNER:

This is your theory, right?

Yes, I think he could have

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. GARDNER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Did you

have an expert testify to that?

No.
Did you get expert

testimony about that or an expert report about that?
MR. GARDNER:

No.

There was no -- there was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think about the same, Your

Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

And you say

12

that he could have dragged him from the pool to the

13

couch because there were drops along the way.

14

MR. GARDNER:

I'm saying that -- that the

15

testimony and -- and the suggestion that there was no

16

trail of blood between the blood pool and the couch is

17

not consistent with what Detective Bell testified to.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. -

And what is your theory

20

about why he -- why Johnson would have a motive to go

21

through this exertion?

22

say there really was a gun -- a gun fight, and Klein

23

fell someplace else.

24

Klein was -- that there wasn't any gun fight.

25

He's -- he's wounded.

And let's

Johnson wants to make it seem like

Why -- why is it so valuable to him to move
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Klein's body from the location where you think he fell

2

to the couch?

3

MR. GARDNER:

Well, if he's -- if he falls

4

in the bedroom doorway, Your Honor, and he falls in a

5

crossfire, then Johnson is in some ways culpable.

6

we don't know what the extent of his culpability is, but

7

if he's involved in firing the first shot, he is

8

culpable.

9

Now,

Putting Klein on the couch and having as

10

State's theory that Klein is shot in cold blood on the

11

couch eliminates his culpability, or at least eliminates

12

the risk of it.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

But he could have -- if he's

14

going to make up a story, he could have made up the

15

story that Klein jumped up and he was shot without

16

having engaged in any firing himself, and he fell

17

wherever he fell.

18

to -- unless I'm missing something and I wish you'd

explain it -- doesn't seem to aid this purportedly false

20

story very much.

Putting him on the couch doesn't seem

And if you weigh whatever benefit there is

22

from that against the exertion of moving this guy, it

MR. GARDNER:

Yes, I don't doubt that in

12

MR. GARDNER:

But I do think it's important

13

to realize that this plan, at least on its face and

14

initially, in terms of his adrenaline response, is going

15

to get him out of a crossfire scenario.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What other -

Counsel, there's a lot

18

of talk about the importance of this pool of blood, but

as I read Detective Bell's testimony, he never posited

20

-- or talks about how that pool was formed.

22

Only your

What Bell does talk about, however, is that

23

there's a high-velocity blood splatter in front of the

couch and that the pooling of blood on Klein's face

25

shows that he was shot there.

6

He had nothing to say about the pool of

He talked about why Klein was shot where he was
And there's no expert testimony to refute that.
So how do you get past there being a

7

reasonable probability of a different verdict when there

8

is nothing to refute the critical testimony at issue,

9

that Klein was shot where he was shot because there's

10

high-velocity blood splatter in front of him and because

11

the pooling on his face shows that?

12

MR. GARDNER:

Let's take both the

13

high-velocity blood spatter and the pooling, Your Honor,

14

but let me start with the predicate.

15

Detective Bell did not testify at all about the

16

formation of the blood pool, and that's why this case

17

isn't about anticipating a State's expert about the

18

blood pool, but about getting your own for your own

19

case.

20

And you are right,

But turning to the specifics of your

21

question, the high-velocity blood spatter.

1

shot while he was lying on the couch, but that he was

2

sitting on the couch.

3

And so what's -- what's most interesting

4

about the high-velocity blood spatter, since he's shot

5

in the head, is that there is none on the wall

6

immediately behind the couch.

7

8

cleared up.

9

behind, on the pristine white wall.

10

This was a matter of some

There's no high-velocity blood spatter

So the question is:

If he's shot while

11

sitting up, the high-velocity blood spatter that Bell

12

testifies to travels, oh, about 4 feet over the couch,

13

and then two drops sink down.

14

evaluating that testimony, it's important to note that

15

Detective Bell gave a description of what high-velocity

16

blood spatter is, and he said it's a fan-like pattern of

17

atomized blood.

18

these two drops alone that travel 4 feet and then drop

19

straight down to fall on a plastic bag, you see, as

20

defense counsel pointed out in his closing argument,

21

that they are the same size as blood drops found in the

22

kitchen on Exhibits R18 to R22.

23

Now, in terms of the jury

And when you look at these two drops,

these were high-velocity was their size.

18

and drugs on people's different perceptions of the

19

events?

20

Okay, that's four.

MR. GARDNER:

Why wouldn't he have

Well, I think the chief reason

21

is, is that that wasn't part of his theory.

If you

22

look -- and really, the guide to this, Your Honor, is

23

defense counsel's own theory, because defense counsel

24

stands up in opening statement and he promises the jury

25

a theory.

And the theory isn't you're going to hear two
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

stories, and you have to assess credibility.

2

His theory, as he explained to the jury, was

3

the physical evidence will show you Pat Klein was not

4

shot on the couch.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, he had not received

6

notice from the State that they were going to call any

7

experts, so why wasn't it reasonable for him to assume

8

they're not going to call any experts, they're not going

9

to be able to pull experts out of their pocket in the

10

midst of the trial, and the judge isn't going to allow

11

them to do that without providing a -- without granting

12

a recess?

13

unusual.

14

What seems to have happened here seems pretty

MR. GARDNER:

Well, if this case were about

15

anticipating the State's decision to call an expert, I

16

would agree, but it's not.

17

because we have an insight into what defense counsel's

18

theory of the case was before the State ever started its

19

case, Your Honor.

20

And the reason it's not is

I mean -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought the Ninth

21

Circuit said that part of the ineffective assistance was

22

failing to consult an expert in planning his defense and

23

in preparing his defense, not simply responding to the

24

State's expert in the middle of trial.

25

MR. GARDNER:

I agree, Your Honor, and if I
35


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

said something that sounded like I didn't, then I

misspoke.

Once defense counsel decides on his defense -- in this

case, I think he picked the right defense.

jury the physical evidence would prove Pat Klein wasn't

6

on the couch, and he could have done that.

My point is that that's exactly the theory.

7

He told the

But despite promising the jury that the

8

physical evidence would prove this, he never consulted

with someone.

10

And once -

nothing to do with where Pat Klein is shot.

do with the angle of his face after he's shot.

same.

23

little to do with where he was shot, but just the angle

24

of his face.

25

And when you read

It has to

So it really -- the blood flow pattern really has

And getting back to the blood spatter
36

Alderson Reporting Company

itself, the blood pool itself, what's interesting in

2

this case now is that, even after all these years, the

3

State has never disputed the fact that the absence of

4

satellite drops means the State's theory is false.

5

Gunner Johnson could not have deposited that

6

blood, because there's no satellite drops, which means

7

it had to come from another source.

8

source is Pat Klein.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The only other

Did I understand you

-- I just want to step back to the prior answer.

11

You think what counsel did here would have

12

been effective assistance but for exactly what he said

13

in the opening statement?

14

MR. GARDNER:

If -- I'm sorry.

If the

15

question is, but for the opening statement, would we

16

still have this argument, yes, although it would be much

17

more difficult to establish what his theory was.

18

opening statement doesn't change the Strickland

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Gardner, what about

the argument that all this is beside the point because

the argument for prejudice is so weak, given all the

MR. GARDNER:

agree with the predicate of the question, Your Honor,

given four or five different stories.

It's more of a reason to do it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with the

ammunition back at Richter's home, that the -- the gun

20

safe is found there and the unlikely story about them

21

going -- having the zeal to clean up their workplace and

22

then coming back?

23

MR. GARDNER:

Well, let me take them one at

And in a sense, the ammo and the

gun safe, the answer is -- is very similar.

decision to focus on credibility rather than expert

3

physical evidence?

4

MR. GARDNER:

I think not.

And -- and -

5

and we know this again for two reasons.

6

start by saying the fact is that when counsel was asked,

7

that wasn't the reason he gave.

8

came to the depo and he said this was my tactical

9

reason, and so we can say, okay, that's a reasonable

tactical decision.

he gave.

was out there.

18

decision.

19

And after

He didn't know what

So, he didn't make that tactical

And that's the first reason.
The second reason, I think, is that -- and

20

almost every case that has ever addressed this -- and I

21

have cited most of them -- has come to the same

22

conclusion.

23

when a defense -- any defense lawyer worth his salt

MR. GARDNER:

MR. GARDNER:

So, that's a

reason why defense counsel in this case and, the Chief

just so they can punch holes in the State's case.

14

MR. GARDNER:

I -- I -- you know, I can

15

understand that, Your Honor, but from practical

16

experience, I will tell you the fact that a client

17

admits to something doesn't mean he did it or she did

it.

And let me turn then to the AEDPA issues in

this case, because on March 28, 2001, this California

25

Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of habeas

day in five other cases, noncapital cases, the

California Supreme Court denied the writ saying the

5

petition for writ of habeas corpus is denied on the

6

merits.

briefing is that the Federal court should simply ignore

8

that difference.

9

for several reasons.

10

That same

And the State's position here today and in the

And I don't believe that's the case

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is your answer to

11

the -- to -- to the representation that In re Robbins

12

settled that when the California Supreme Court says just

13

denied, it's on the merits?

14

MR. GARDNER:

Well, actually I agree and I

15

disagree.

16

State law perspective, but not as the Attorney General

17

has suggested.

18
19
20

In re Robbins does settle the matter from a

In re Robbins says a few things.

First, it says that when we deny a case on
the merits, we add the phrase "on the merits."
Then it says that when we find a procedural

21

default, we cite to that default so that everyone knows.

22

And then it says -- and this was in response

23

to a question I think you asked, Justice Scalia -- they

24

say a third thing.

25

that it's meritless and it's defaulted, and we will say

They say sometimes we'll find both,

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

both.

We will cite a default, and we will say it's

2

denied on the merits as well, trusting that the Federal

3

courts will give deference to -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what they cite it for,

5

actually, is they make a slightly different argument in

6

their brief.

7

least three cases in the Ninth Circuit that have said

8

when the California Supreme Court says nothing, just

9

denied, we take that as a decision to reach the Federal

10

They say going back to 1974, there are at

issue and deny it on the merits.

11

Now, not in your case, but in most cases

12

that will benefit a defendant, because it will avoid the

13

question of whether there's an adequate and independent

14

State ground of a procedural nature.

15

saying is that that's the Ninth Circuit's statement in

16

three cases, and the California Supreme Court over a

17

course of 30 years has never said to the contrary, which

18

it had plenty of opportunity to do, and in other

19

instances where the Ninth Circuit was wrong, it did do

20

it.

21

So, what they're

So, that, I think, is a fairly strong

22

argument.

Now, you're going to -- the only reason that

23

you're not out of court on your own interpretation is

24

because you'll say that the State waived the procedural

25

issue.

And then they'll come back and say so did you.
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

So, what -- what is your response to all
that?

MR. GARDNER:

Well, I -- there's a whole

bunch there, so let me see if I can -- if I can tease it

5

out.

6

process, this procedure for a long time, and, of course,

7

it developed in a pre-AEDPA world, when the fact whether

8

something was on the merits or not didn't really matter.

9

The only question was, Was it defaulted?

It is true that the Ninth Circuit has had this

And if it was

10

defaulted, it might bar Federal review.

11

on the merits was really irrelevant because, before

12

2254(d), that really didn't matter.

13

Whether it was

So that's where -- and I agree with the

14

State -- that's where those cases come from.

15

believe, however, that the waiver argument is really

16

implicated here, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't

Well, look, for example, in

18

Hunter v. Aispuro -- they quote it as saying the

19

following:

20

21

citation constitutes, a decision on the merits of the

22

Federal claims."

23

other cases roughly to the same effect.

25

The California Supreme Court's denial of a

End quote.

And then they have three

Now, what you're saying is that this Court
should hold to the contrary, and by the way, in doing
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that, we will bar many Federal habeas petitioners from

2

the Federal courts, because what it will mean is that

3

there is an adequate and independent State ground in

4

case after case, which perhaps is an irrelevant feature.

5

But, nonetheless, the silence of the California Supreme

6

Court is significant, I think, when faced with those

7

pretty clear interpretations of what their silence means

8

by the Ninth Circuit.

9

MR. GARDNER:

Yes.

And actually if the

10

Ninth Circuit were the only voice in the fray, Your

11

Honor, I think the argument would be stronger, but the

12

Ninth Circuit's voice isn't the only voice in the fray,

13

and that brings me to Ylst.

14

Ninth -- and Ylst v. Nunnemaker is a case which is part

15

and parcel of this history from the Ninth Circuit of

16

saying silent denial is on the merits.

17

In Ylst, of course, the

In Ylst v. Nunnemaker that's exactly what

18

the Ninth Circuit said.

And it came to this Court, and

19

the State actually argued that it wasn't on the merits.

20

And, indeed, this Court held that you cannot tell from a

21

silent denial whether it's on the merits or not.

22

the first response, Your Honor, is that there are

23

additional voices other than the Ninth Circuit.

24

second is that well after Hunter v. Aispuro comes the

25

Robbins footnote and in the Robbins footnote -
50

Alderson Reporting Company

That's

The

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm having a very hard

2

time with your reliance on that footnote because the

3

very last paragraph of that footnote says when

4

Respondent's asserts -- and I'm shortening the

5

introductory line -- a State procedural bar and when

6

nevertheless our order disposing of a habeas corpus

7

position does not impose the proposed bar or bars as to

8

that claim, that signifies that we have considered

9

Respondent's assertion and have determined that the

10

claim or subclaim is not barred on the procedural

11

ground.

12

MR. GARDNER:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the footnote itself

14

says unless we invoke the procedural bar, we're not

15

applying it.

16

MR. GARDNER:

I think that's right, Your

17

Honor, but that's not the only thing the footnote says.

18

The footnote says when we deny on the merits, we say on

19

the merits; when we cite a procedural bar, we mean a

20

bar; and if the State has raised a bar, as they did

21

here, and we don't rely on it, that means we haven't

22

relied on the procedural bar.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

MR. GARDNER:

25

Right.

what it means is there was no majority for a decision on

tell because there are seven judges, there are different

claims, there are different possibilities.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

With this confusion, your

11

version, your colleague's version, when the district

12

court -- the district court denied relief, did you ask

13

the district court, please certify this question of what

14

a silent denial means, certify it to the California

15

Supreme Court so we will have once and for all an answer

16

of what a silent denial means?

17

MR. GARDNER:

The answer is no, I didn't

18

request certification.

When we were in district court

19

and when we were in the Ninth Circuit, both sides

20

accepted the existing framework the Ninth Circuit had

21

established applies to a silent denial, but only under

22

-- only through the lens of independent review.

23

Court's added question has put both of those at issue.

Court has had a very spirited discussion this morning

essentially conducting a de novo Strickland review of

this case.

It has always been an AEDPA case.

We've
The

It's important to remember that we have to

14

view, as this Court described in Woodford v. Visciotti,

15

a Strickland claim through the lens of the applicant's

16

burden to demonstrate that the State court's resolution

17

of the Strickland claim on the facts of his case was

18

objectively unreasonable.

19

Whether this Court were to choose to find

20

that the California Supreme Court's determination, if it

21

were reviewed de novo, was improper is different from

22

determining whether or not the State court could have

23

reasonably concluded, on the factual record presented to

24

it, that the applicant's claim failed to -- to show a

25

basis for relief.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it fair to say that this

2

-- in this case, that every party in the lower courts

3

assumed this was going to be a merits-related issue and

4

that some deference was due, and that nobody ever said

5

anything about it being a procedural issue where there

6

would be a procedural bar of some kind that was either

7

waived or not waived?

8

MR. COLOMBO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. COLOMBO:

When Respondent's counsel

JUSTICE BREYER:

That was on the merits

brief in opposition?

15

MR. COLOMBO:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

The first time anybody

filed his brief in opposition in this Court.

13
14

That's correct.
There was nothing before

that?

18

MR. COLOMBO:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

The -

mentioned this procedural issue was when?

11
12

That's correct.

Yes.
It wasn't part of the

cert -- the question -- we added the question.
MR. COLOMBO:

Well, I would submit that if

22

there was a dispute about the applicability of AEDPA

23

deference to the California Supreme Court's summary

24

denial in this case, it should have been raised much

25

earlier than when we got to this Court.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm saying they

didn't raise it to start with; we added the question.

3

MR. COLOMBO:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

No, no.

Yes, that's true.
So it wasn't as if they

were trying to get around their own waiver?

6

MR. COLOMBO:

No, I wouldn't suggest that

7

Respondent's counsel was avoiding that.

8

that if this was a legitimately disputed question, it

9

could have been addressed much earlier.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm suggesting

Excuse me.

You've lost me.

11

I thought you said -- I thought you said that they

raised it in the brief in opposition to the petition for

MR. COLOMBO:

Yes.

I wanted, if I may, just

20

touch a couple of points real quickly.

21

footnote -- I believe it's 6 of our reply brief, there's

22

a discussion about what the detective's testimony was in

23

regard to this blood spatter near the couch where the -

24

where the murder victim's body was found.

25

important to remember Respondent's counsel talked about
58

Alderson Reporting Company

On page 23 in

I think it's

Official

1

whether or not this spatter would have been consistent

2

with having been shot on the couch if there were blood

3

spatter behind the armrest.

4

What the detective testified to and what's

5

described in our brief is the detective said because

6

this was not a through-and-through exit wound -- that

7

is, the bullet lodged in the victim's head -- that the

8

spatter would have been what he described as back

9

spatter, meaning the blood would have flown out from the

10

victim's head outward, and that was consistent with what

11

the evidence was at the crime scene that the detective

12

observed when he was there after the murder was

13

committed.

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about the drops

between the blood pool and the couch?

16

MR. COLOMBO:

The detective described those

17

as essentially insignificant, that they didn't reflect

18

anything other than that someone was moving around in

19

the house, which was consistent with what the crime

20

scene investigators had discovered when they first

21

responded to the 9-1-1 call from the -- Mr. Johnson to

22

the police.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any reason not to

24

do this?

I'm just thinking from our point of view -- I

25

mean, I think it's probably correct what you say:
59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Nobody mentioned a word about this procedural issue

2

until the brief in opposition on the merits, not the

3

cert brief.

And the reason they did was perfectly

4

legitimate:

We'd asked the question.

5

Well, if we were wrong to do that, could -

6

and if we took the opinion as being a question of

7

reasonable deference, et cetera, and went into it, is

8

there anything -- any reason not to put in that opinion

9

somewhere, given Ylst and given the Ninth Circuit, it

10

would be helpful if the California Supreme Court, for

11

future reference, explained what their practice does in

12

fact mean, whether it's procedural or whether it's on

13

the merits?

14

MR. COLOMBO:

I would submit that that would

15

be helpful but unnecessary.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

All right.
Thank you, counsel,

counsel.
