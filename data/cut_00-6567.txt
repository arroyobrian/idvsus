ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10
11

MS. ZIEVE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:

The issue in this case is whether the procedures


12

used to serve notice of forfeiture of petitioner's


13

property satisfied due process. 


14

The Federal Government forfeited Mr. Dusenbery's


15

$22,000 in 1988 after mailing a notice to him at the


16

Federal prison where he was incarcerated.

17

disputed that he did not get the notice. 


18

It is not


The -- the Government argues that its 1988


19

procedures satisfied due process whether or not the notice


20

was received.

21

presented here, including the Government's control over


22

the prisoner's location and knowledge of the prisoner's


23

location at all times and its control over prison


24

procedures, due process requires the Government to use


25

procedures that offer assurances of delivery to the inmate


However, in light of the circumstances


3


1

addressee and not just to prison personnel.

2

procedures --


3

QUESTION:

Such


Well, you take the position that it's


4

not sufficient that there be staff at the prison who


5

deliver mail to the inmates?


6
7

MS. ZIEVE:
sufficient.

8
9
10
11

That, in and of itself, is not


The -- the procedures need --


QUESTION:

A procedure whereby a prison employee


delivers certified mail to prisoners is inadequate in

your --

MS. ZIEVE:

That -- that, in and of itself, is


12

inadequate as -- although --


13

QUESTION:

14

MS. ZIEVE:

15
16
17
18

Is in adequate? 

Is inadequate, although those


procedures --

QUESTION:

How can that be under any of our case


law, that that would be in adequate per se?

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, the -- under this Court's case


19

law, what's required when the notice is served is


20

determined by a consideration of a balance of factors in


21

light of the circumstances.

And that --


22

QUESTION:

23

notice in any case, have we? 


24

MS. ZIEVE:

25

Well, we've never required actual


No, although there is some


suggestion of that in -- in a couple cases, for instance,

4


1

Phillips Petroleum.

2

the briefs, there is not a requirement of actual notice,


3

but at the same time, the Court assumes that the mailed


4

notice or the form of notice will be received, and the


5

Court hasn't considered a case where it was uncontested


6

that individual -- an individual was entitled to notice


7

and yet the notice wasn't received. 


8
9

QUESTION:

But in -- in the cases discussed in


Well, but that's going to happen


sometimes with any sort of notice except the requirement


10

of actual receipt by the individual, and we've never felt


11

that destroyed the validity of the notice.


12

MS. ZIEVE:

That's true, Your Honor, but in the


13

circumstances presented here, consideration of the balance


14

of factors leads to a requirement the procedures that


15

would satisfy those factors would also lead to actual


16

notice.

17

procedures under which, after the mail is received by the


18

prison, there's not just some vague distribution process


19

at the prison, but the mail is signed for.

20

room, there's a log book kept, and when it leaves the mail


21

room a log book is kept that is ultimately signed for by


22

the inmate.

23

that there's extra care and attention paid with the


24

delivery of the notice.


25

For instance, today the Government uses


In the mail


And this chain of receipts helps to ensure


QUESTION:

Would you be satisfied with that if

5


1

that had been the case here? 


2

MS. ZIEVE:

3
4

Yes.

If those procedures had been


followed.

QUESTION:

Even -- even though there was -- I


5

was going to say even though there was no receipt


6

signature, but I guess under the procedures now, the --


7

the prisoner would have signed a log.

8
9
10
11

MS. ZIEVE:

Is that right?


Yes, he would have signed a log. 


And if he had a challenge and he has a signature, he's

going to lose, and if there is no signature -- excuse me.

QUESTION:

The procedure that was in place for


12

certain kinds of mail that was labeled special mail -- if


13

that had been -- if that had applied to notices in this


14

category -- special mail, as I understand it, could be


15

opened only in the presence of the prisoner?


16

MS. ZIEVE:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct. 

And if that had applied, that old


18

rule had applied to this category of mail, you would not


19

object to that, would you? 


20

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, the special mail opened only


21

in front of the prisoner happens after it's delivered to


22

the prisoner.

23

DEA, in recent years -- the Government writes in its


24

brief, in recent years, have considered forfeiture notices


25

and labeled those as special mail, but the procedure still


I think it's helpful that the FBI and the


6


1

needs to be adequate to get to that point where you're


2

standing in front of the prisoner opening the mail. 


3

QUESTION:

Ms. Zieve, I'm -- I'm not sure what


4

-- what is the general principle of which you assert the


5

rule that you urge upon us in this case is -- is just an


6

exemplar.

7

Government is in charge of the delivery system, there must


8

be actual notice evidenced by a signature of whoever it's


9

delivered to? 


10

Is the general principle that when the


MS. ZIEVE:

Your Honor, that's one important


11

factor, but the case here is even easier because there are


12

-- there are numerous --


13

QUESTION:

You're not urging that when the --


14

that the distinctive factor is that the Government is in


15

charge of the delivery system because that would have been


16

the case in the old post office when -- when the post


17

office was actually part of the Federal Government.

18

that's not the principle.

19
20

MS. ZIEVE:

So,


Right? 


That's not the only factor.

Here we


have not --


21

QUESTION:

What -- what is the principle?

22

the Government is in charge of the residence?

23

we would need a similar rule for all members of the armed


24

forces. 


25

MS. ZIEVE:

Right?

When

So,


There are several key factors here,

7


1

and I don't think you can separate out one circumstance


2

from the rest.

3

The inmate --


QUESTION:
Right?

Well, you said the first one isn't


4

it.

5

enough, I don't know why all in combination turn out to be


6

enough. 


7

I don't understand.

MS. ZIEVE:

If neither one alone is


Because that's the circumstances. 


8

There's a body of circumstances presented here.

9

inmate's location is not just easily ascertainable by the


10

Government, but determined by the Government.

11

procedures used for --


12
13

QUESTION:

MS. ZIEVE:

18

Well, that would apply -- that would


The procedures used for delivery are


also determined by the Government, and --


16
17

The


apply to all members of the armed forces. 


14
15

The


QUESTION:

That would also apply to the armed


forces. 

MS. ZIEVE:

And the Government is in an adverse


19

position, which I think requires additional cross checks


20

in the system to ensure that care is taken because the


21

Government doesn't have incentive to identify and rectify


22

inefficiencies on its own. 


23

QUESTION:

You really think that that's


24

realistic here?

You would not urge us to apply this rule


25

in a civil action where your client was being served a

8


1

paper by -- by someone who is not the Government. 


2

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, if the -- if the serving party


3

were not the Government, then the person doing the service


4

would not be the person who was also in control of the


5

delivery procedures. 


6

QUESTION:

7

MS. ZIEVE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

I understand that. 

So --

So, you have not urged the rule in


that case, only when the Government is -- is the opposing

party. 


11

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, I'm not trying to be evasive,


12

but it's hard to answer without knowing all the


13

circumstances there.

14

QUESTION:

For instance, what would be the --

All the other circumstances are just


15

like this one except that the complaint was not on behalf


16

of the Government.

17

MS. ZIEVE:

It was behalf on a private individual.

Well, then the private individual


18

wouldn't have control over the procedures.

19

that mailing wasn't -- wasn't adequate in that


20

circumstance.

21

property.


22

It might be


It might have to do with the value of the


QUESTION:

You can answer this yes or no.

Do


23

you assert that your rule would apply in that situation or


24

not?

25

difference is the complaint was not filed by the


All of the circumstances are the same.

9


The only


1
2
3
4

Government, but by a private party.

QUESTION:

Say it was for an ordinary debt, that


the prisoner owed money and the creditor brought suit.

MS. ZIEVE:

It might not apply in that


5

circumstance, but whether or not it does, this is an


6

easier case. 


7

QUESTION:

Let -- let me ask you.

I -- I take


8

it you begin from the premise that mailed notice is


9

adequate for a civil suit, or do you?

I'm going to ask


10

the Government the same thing.

11

write an opinion that -- that says that mailed notice is


12

adequate in any civil suit? 


13

MS. ZIEVE:

No.

I -- are we supposed to


The -- in fact, under rule 4(d)


14

mailed notice is not adequate under civil suit -- for any


15

civil suit.

16

But I don't think --


QUESTION:

From a constitutional -- I know what


17

4(e) says, but from a constitutional standpoint, is mailed


18

notice adequate in any civil suit? 


19
20
21

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, I think it's probably not


adequate in any civil suit.

QUESTION:

All right.

What is -- what is it


22

about this that makes mailed notice adequate whereas


23

apparently there's another class of cases in which


24

personal service is required? 


25

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, this case --

10


1

QUESTION:

You -- you begin I -- I think with


2

the assumption that mailed notice would be adequate, and


3

the question is, are these mailing procedures adequate in


4

this case? 


5

MS. ZIEVE:

6

QUESTION:

Well, no, Your Honor --

But I'm -- I don't want to have you


7

take a position you don't take.

8

me that that is the baseline assumption from where you


9

begin the argument.

10

MS. ZIEVE:

But it -- it does seem to


Am I correct about that? 

Not exactly, Your Honor.

This case


11

is not really a mailed notice case because the procedures


12

that are inadequate are the procedures that happened after


13

the mailing.

14

delivery chain, and the question here is the adequacy of


15

the procedures after that. 


16

The mailing is the first step in the


QUESTION:

But I'm asking why is mail adequate


17

at all?

18

decide the case on that basis.

19

assumption that if the mail were received, the mailed


20

notice would be adequate. 


21
22
23

You seem to assume that, and that's fine.

MS. ZIEVE:

We can


But you make the


If the mail is received by the


inmate? 

QUESTION:

Yes.

And I want to know why that is. 


24

I'm going to ask the Government.

25

case, it would seem to me that at least an argument could

11


If we have to write this


1

be made that personal service is required --


2

MS. ZIEVE:

3

QUESTION:

Well --

-- in any civil case.

And then we


4

ask if this is a forfeiture or there's some old hangover


5

from the in rem idea that is still somehow affecting us


6

even though we don't talk about in rem anymore and so


7

forth. 


8
9
10
11

But I want to know what your -- your beginning

principle is for the due process, elementary, minimum

standards of service.

MS. ZIEVE:

The mailed notice is any form of


12

delivery -- any form of notice is adequate as to that


13

individual if it's received.

14

adequate when it's received, and in this case, the


15

Government's procedures used certified mail so that you


16

know that the mail was received.

17

mailed the certified mail to the proper prison and it had


18

not been received, the certified mail slip never came


19

back, then I don't think the mailed service would have


20

been adequate. 


21
22
23

QUESTION:

The mailed notice is


If the Government had


Have any of our cases ever required


certified mail? 

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, the first case where the Court


24

considers whether mailed notices is constitutional in Hess


25

v. Pawloski, the mail at issue was certified mail. 

12


1

Subsequent to that, the Court hasn't made a distinction


2

between the form of mail. 


3

The Court also hasn't considered the case where


4

mail was sent but not received.

5

Mennonite Board and Tulsa Professional Collection


6

Services, in the cases discussed in the briefs, the


7

question was whether an individual was entitled to notice


8

in addition to publication or posting, not whether -- the


9

Court had no occasion to consider what would happen if the


10
11

And the Court's cases in


notice was mailed but never got there.

QUESTION:

It seems to me one of the


12

difficulties I find with your position, Ms. Zieve, is that


13

this inquiry can come up, you know, months and maybe years


14

after the actual notice took place or didn't take place. 


15

And it's one thing to say we have a -- you followed a


16

system and that system affords due process, but to have


17

every case turn on perhaps an argument between the person


18

who's seeking to set aside the service -- I never received


19

it -- and someone else saying, yes, you did receive it, I


20

think is rather unsatisfactory. 


21

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, that's why the procedures


22

should require proof of verification which the


23

Government's procedures do today.

24

served with a forfeiture notice today, he would be


25

required to sign for it and there would be no question

13


If Mr. Dusenbery was


1

later about whether or not he received it. 


2

QUESTION:

Was he not --


3

QUESTION:

Your --


4

QUESTION:

The question I'd have is we all seem


5

to agree now that the question -- the Government has to


6

provide reasonable procedures.

7

reasonably calculated to give actual notice.


8

MS. ZIEVE:

9

QUESTION:

Reasonable means


Under the circumstances. 

Well, don't say -- there's no such


10

thing.

11

doesn't add anything I don't think.

12

reasonably calculated to give actual notice.

13

figured out your qualification, how that would work. 


14
15

There's no such thing.

I haven't


Precisely what's


wrong with these procedures in your opinion? 

MS. ZIEVE:

17

QUESTION:

19

You say is it


But why wasn't this precisely?

16

18

Under the circumstances


The --

Why are they not calculated to give


actual notice reasonably?

MS. ZIEVE:

The 1988 procedures did not provide


20

assurances of delivery because what happened after the


21

mail reached the mail room is -- was vague and


22

undocumented.

23

And as the Government acknowledged --


QUESTION:

I always thought the procedure -- I


24

thought the -- what -- what -- tell me precisely.

25

the procedure is, A, mailed to a prison.
14


I think


B, it comes to a


1

prison, and a person who works for the prison signs for


2

it.

3

required?

Then the procedure required what?

4

C.

What was it


And then what should it have required? 

MS. ZIEVE:

The procedure was that the mail room


5

employee picked up the mail and signed the certified mail


6

receipt at the post office, brought it back to the prison,


7

where he entered it in a log book.

8

testified that in 1988 the procedure then would have been


9

that a -- a housing unit staff would have signed when he


10

took the mail -- the certified mail out of the mail room.


11

QUESTION:

12

MS. ZIEVE:

13

A prison employee


Yes. 

He also testified that he didn't


know what the procedure was after that.


14

QUESTION:

All right.

I guess after that -- a


15

reasonable person would think the procedure after that is


16

you give it to the person it's addressed to.

17

mean that would be normal in life.

18

that that wasn't the procedure?

19

MS. ZIEVE:

No.

QUESTION:

Okay.

20
21

Now, is -- I


Is there any testimony


No. 


There was no testimony about


that.

Now, we've described the


22

procedure, and now you tell me what, in your opinion, is


23

wrong with that procedure. 


24
25

MS. ZIEVE:

The procedure doesn't require


verification of delivery and that --

15


1

QUESTION:

Okay.

So, in your opinion, it is


2

unreasonable not to have an additional step that the


3

prisoner signs for it.


4

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes, and the reason is this. 


5

Because the documentation -- the improved documentation


6

improves delivery.

7

of Prisons memorandum that the Solicitor General lodged


8

with the Court both in 1999 and 2001 -- it ties improved


9

documentation to improved delivery.


10

QUESTION:

The -- the Department of Justice Board


Then -- then whenever there's a


11

requirement or -- a requirement -- procedure for service


12

by mail, it should be certified mail so the person signs


13

for it in every case. 


14

MS. ZIEVE:

15

QUESTION:

In --

Ms. Zieve, you couldn't say every


16

case because in Mullane regular mail was adequate in that


17

under the circumstances, which was heavily emphasized by


18

Justice Jackson, those words, under the circumstances. 


19

MS. ZIEVE:

In Mullane and in some cases where


20

there's a class of interested parties where everyone has


21

this same interest, it might not be necessary for all


22

interested parties to receive the notice.

23

recognized in Mullane, because there were many


24

beneficiaries of a 113 different trusts and they all had a


25

identical interests --

16


As the Court


1

QUESTION:

All right.

Then I'll -- then I'll


2

amend my question.

3

defendant and service is permitted by mail, it must be by


4

certified mail.


5

In a case where there is only a single


MS. ZIEVE:

Well, that would likely be


6

reasonable since the burden of doing so is so small and


7

the increased -- the decreased risk of it not reaching the


8

addressee would be --


9

QUESTION:

You don't mean that it might


10

reasonable.

You mean it isn't reasonable not to do it.


11

That's your argument. 


12

MS. ZIEVE:

13

QUESTION:

Right. 

It isn't reasonable not to do it. 


14

And I guess a person who thought it was reasonable not to


15

do it would say, well, we can't think of everything, and


16

you know, it's in the prison, and prisons normally do


17

work.

18

fairly disciplined order.

19

your response to that is what? 


20
21
22

I mean, they're not great, but they have a -- a


MS. ZIEVE:
circumstances.

And so, it's good enough.

And


It wasn't good enough in -- in these


The Government has shown us --


QUESTION:

Well, they might -- they might say


23

more than that.

They might say we have no reason to


24

believe that the prison delivery system is any worse than


25

the post office's delivery system. 

17


1

And I -- I guess it's your -- I guess it's your


2

contention that even if the reason your client never


3

received the notice was -- had nothing to do with the


4

fault of the -- of the prison.

5

that lost the -- the notice on the way.

6

-- that would still invalidate the service.

7
8

MS. ZIEVE:

It was the Postal Service

That would still

Right? 


It would still mean the forfeiture


was done without adequate notice. 


9

QUESTION:

So that -- so -- which would not be


10

the case, I suppose, unless you're going to adopt the


11

certified mail rule, which would not be the case for an


12

ordinary citizen who is not incarcerated.

13

sent to an ordinary citizen and the post office looses it,


14

unless you adopt the certified mail rule, that would be


15

adequate notice.

16

person, if the post office looses it, it is not adequate


17

notice.

18

If notice is


But in the case of an incarcerated


Right? 

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, I don't know that it would be


19

adequate notice to serve someone by mail out of prison if


20

it's not received. 


21

QUESTION:

Well, what is -- what is the


22

statutory requirement in your view for forfeiture as -- as


23

far as notice is concerned? 


24

MS. ZIEVE:

25

QUESTION:

The statutory requirement? 

Yes.

MS. ZIEVE:

interested party. 


3

QUESTION:

4

Is publication and notice to the


By mail?

What is the general


statutory requirement on these forfeiture notices? 


5

MS. ZIEVE:

I believe the statute says by mail,


6

although the Government always does it by certified mail. 


7

And it does that --

Is it in the materials we have in the

that you're aware of in the briefs?

time if you don't know.

12

Is in your brief at all? 


13

MS. ZIEVE:

I just thought perhaps you knew. 


It's on page 3 of the Government's


brief.

MS. ZIEVE:

It just says, shall be sent to each


party who appears to have an interest.

See, that's why I don't know how to


19

do it because, I mean, suppose there's a ship, for


20

example.

21

ships.

22

could have ships that are owned by thousands of people,


23

for example.

24

thing, it's fairly normal that you don't actually have to


25

get the signature of every person who has some interest in


Take the other extreme case.

People forfeit


People have tort actions against ships, and you


And where you bring the action against the


19


1

that ship, for example.

2

do you have to get the signature? 


3

Now, I think, am I not right, or


If -- if, for example, you're bringing an action


4

against a thing and the thing is owned by millions,


5

thousands, or hundreds, does the -- do you have to


6

normally, under the rules -- forget the Constitution for


7

the moment -- you have to get the signature on a -- on


8

that notice, a return receipt requested of each person who


9

has an interest in that thing? 


10

MS. ZIEVE:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. ZIEVE:

Under the statute? 

Yes. 

Now, you've asked a sort of


13

complicated question because the statute for an in rem


14

judicial forfeiture requires publication, but the


15

Government, based on this Court's case law, gives notice


16

by certified mail. 


17

QUESTION:

But I take it your argument would be


18

that even if all the signatures are not required in the in


19

rem case, there is -- there is a fairness in the procedure


20

that would not require actual notice and signatures to


21

every ship owner because the owner of the ship at least


22

has some right to control the ship.

23

-- if they don't pay attention to what's happening to


24

their ship, we -- we can tag them with that. 


25

So, you say, look, if


But the difference between that case and this,

20


1

as I understand it, is there is a period between delivery


2

of the letter and what should be the point of receipt by


3

the prisoner when the prisoner is not in control of the


4

process.

5

we assume regularity on the post office is normally


6

enough, that isn't enough here because there's a hiatus


7

between where the post office stops and the point at which


8

we hope the prisoner gets the delivery. 


9

The post office has finished its part.

So, if


And I take it you would be satisfied in this


10

case, even without a rule requiring actual signature, if


11

the Government were required to show, with a greater


12

detail than you say it has here, that there was a regular


13

procedure, at the time involved here, that makes it just


14

as probable that the letter would have gotten from the


15

front door of the prison to the prisoner, as it is


16

probable that the letter mailed in the box gets to the


17

front door of the prison.

18

kind of a rule, wouldn't you? 


19

MS. ZIEVE:

20

I'm not -- it's not -- it's


not important to petitioner how the procedures --


21
22

Yes.

You'd be satisfied with that


QUESTION:
wins.

How he wins the case as long as he


I realize that. 


23

(Laughter.) 


24

MS. ZIEVE:

25

QUESTION:

No. 

I mean, you would -- you would be

21


1

satisfied if -- if we had the -- I take it, the same kind


2

of demand for proof of regularity for the period between


3

the front door of the prison and the prisoner's cell that


4

we do from the mailbox to the front door of the prison. 


5

That would be a reasonable system.

6

satisfied with it, I would take it, as a general rule.


7

MS. ZIEVE:

8

QUESTION:

9

And -- and you'd be


Probably. 

It would be nice to have a signature


requirement, but basically we -- we would have the same


10

kind of rule then that we have with -- with respect to


11

mail delivery in general. 


12

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes, but the reason that I emphasize


13

the signature is because, as the Bureau of Prisons has


14

since recognized, the -- the signature does help to


15

improve delivery.

16

is treated with some extra attention and care.

17

that it's not going to get misdelivered to Larry Smith two


18

cells over. 


19
20
21

It helps to make sure that this letter


QUESTION:

It ensures


What do we do with prisoners who


won't sign? 

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, actually the Board of Prisons


22

procedures deal with that, and I think effectively, which


23

is on the log book, if the prisoner refuses to sign, then


24

the person delivering the mail signs for it stating that


25

the prisoner won't sign, which I think is comparable to a

22


1

process server giving a contemporaneous statement that


2

service has been completed. 


3

QUESTION:

You know, it seems to me we need to


4

focus on some kind of a test, and I thought I understood


5

you to argue for a test that says in these prison cases,


6

there has to be actual receipt by the prisoner.

7

I know the Third Circuit and probably the Fourth have a


8

different sort of test, which is that the Government just


9

has to show that internal prison delivery procedures are


10

adequate.

11

test?


12

And I --


Is that an acceptable general statement of the


MS. ZIEVE:

They have to be adequate.

My view


13

is that under this Court's -- the analysis that this Court


14

has used in its cases, in its due process cases, that


15

applying that general statement leads to the same result


16

that I'm arguing for here, although if the Court --


17
18
19

QUESTION:

You say it isn't adequate unless


there's actual receipt. 

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes, because those procedures are --


20

it's entirely practicable to do that.

21

not difficult to --


22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

There's -- it is


Well, in the event we don't agree


with you, what's your fall-back position? 

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, even under the Third Circuit's


formulation, the Court, looking at the 1988 procedures in

23


1

the record, such as they are -- those procedures were


2

inadequate.

3

notice, and the procedures as described, are inadequate,


4

although for the same reasons as I think lead to actual


5

notice, even if you don't want to go that far. 


6

It's uncontested that he didn't get the


QUESTION:

Why is it that a procedure is


7

inadequate if the procedure is that if we get certified


8

mail, we -- we deliver it to the prisoner?

9

inadequate about that as a procedural standard?


10

MS. ZIEVE:

What's


Again, it doesn't provide the


11

assurances of delivery that both are feasible because, if


12

you're going to deliver it, it doesn't take that much to


13

just get the signature, and because I think it's important


14

to have cross checks to make sure that the Government --


15

QUESTION:

Do we look back at Mullane or at


16

Mathews v. Eldridge for our guidance here in establishing


17

a standard?


18

MS. ZIEVE:

I think either one, Your Honor. 


19

Mullane states -- sort of states the test in one sentence,


20

but I think summarizes the three-part framework that


21

Mathews articulates later.

22

23

of erroneous deprivation, the valuable -- the value of


24

additional procedures, and the burden on the Government,


25

the factors to consider, all lead to same -- to the result


Either way you can reach the


The value of the property at stake, the risk


24


1

here that the prison should have done more and could have


2

and should have ensured actual notice to inmates in its


3

charge. 


4

QUESTION:

-- apply this rule to any -- anything


5

other than prisons or are you talking about the


6

circumstances of someone incarcerated by the Government? 


7

Is there any other setting in which you would require not


8

merely that certified mail be sent and signed for by


9

someone, but in-hand delivery? 


10

MS. ZIEVE:

There may be other cases, though


11

there also may not be.

12

any circumstances where actual notice is required, it's


13

got to be these where the Government is both the sender


14

and sort of the recipient for later delivery to the person


15

who it knows where it is --


16

QUESTION:

This is the easy case.

Why is it the easy case?

If there's


It is the


17

case, I take it from your argument, because you haven't


18

suggested that there might be another setting other than


19

where the Government has someone in confinement. 


20

MS. ZIEVE:

21

QUESTION:

No, I haven't. 

Is it any part of your argument that


22

we should be suspicious of prison officials because they


23

may use a refusal to follow their procedures for


24

vindictive reasons or anything like that? 


25

MS. ZIEVE:

That may occur, Your Honor, but our

25


1

argument does not rely on any malfeasance on the


2

Government's part. 


3

QUESTION:

That's not your argument. 


4

QUESTION:

Well, if that's not part of your


5

argument, I don't see why your situation is any different


6

from the military situation where, unless -- unless the


7

serviceman or woman is AWOL, the Government knows right


8

where that person is and the Government is responsible for


9

-- for where that person is.

I don't know why you


10

wouldn't have the same rule.

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, to be honest, I hadn't

considered the military situation, and maybe there's more

parallels.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR


2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


3
4

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


5

This Court has repeatedly held that the notice


6

requirements of the Due Process Clause are satisfied by a


7

method of notice that's reasonably calculated to provide


8

interested parties with notice of the proceedings.


9

The Government's method of providing notice in


10

this case, this forfeiture case, satisfies that test.

11

method was by the use of certified mail.

12

does not dispute that mails generally are satisfactory for


13

purposes of notice.

14

only in the case of prisoners is that method unwarranted


15

or unconstitutional. 


16

And petitioner


Rather they draw the distinction that


Petitioner is asserting a constitutional


17

violation.

18

establishing the procedures the Government used are


19

unconstitutional. 


20

It therefore has the burden of proof of


And I'd like to clarify a point with regard to


21

whether notice was received here or not.

22

has not submitted that notice was not received.

23

are unable to prove that it was not received. 


24
25

The


QUESTION:

The Government

We simply


So, why not just put the burden on


the person who was supposed to get it to prove he didn't

27


1

get it? 


2

MR. MINEAR:

Well, that is in fact what the 


3

court did.

4

but the inquiry was made, and the court concluded that


5

whatever the protestations of the defendant might be, or


6

the prisoner in this case, nevertheless the method that


7

was used here was reasonably calculated to reach him.

8

that is all that Mullane requires. 


9

It didn't -- there wasn't a test it required,


QUESTION:

No, no.

And


Look, what I take it that


10

she's arguing for is there's a step missing here and it


11

should apply not just to prisoners, apply to anybody who's


12

going to have their property forfeited, and that is, you


13

give them notice by certified mail so they have to sign


14

it.

15

armed forces, everybody.

16

isn't that hard to do.

17

against losing your property without even knowing about


18

it.

That's the point.

So, it would apply to everybody,

And what's wrong with that?
It protects pretty thoroughly


So, do it. 


19

MR. MINEAR:

20

QUESTION:

21

understand it, the argument. 


22

It


MR. MINEAR:

The problem --

That's -- that's basically, as I


The problem with that position is


23

it's contrary to 50 years of this Court's precedence,


24

which has consistently recognized that mailing alone --


25

not certified mail -- but ordinary mail, is sufficient to

28


1

provide parties with notice.


2

QUESTION:

Where did the Court hold that? 


3

QUESTION:

Have we ever said that with reference


4
5

to a simple contract or tort action? 

MR. MINEAR:

No.

All of the cases in which this


6

issue has arisen in this Court's jurisprudence have


7

involved special procedures.

8
9

QUESTION:

Nevertheless --


Well, that's why I'm asking because


in Mullane and subsequent cases, we have tended to say


10

that the in rem/in personam distinction is -- is not too


11

clear a line. 


12

Are you arguing for the proposition that, again,


13

in a standard contract or tort case, notice by mail would


14

be sufficient? 


15

MR. MINEAR:

We are certainly willing to defend


16

the proposition that the Federal Rules of Procedure, which


17

provide --


18
19
20

QUESTION:

No.

I'm talking about -- I'm talking


about due process requirements now. 

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

And -- and with regard to the


21

Federal Rules, they do recognize that service can be


22

effected through mail -- through the notice of waiver


23

provisions that are set forth there, and we would defend


24

the constitutionality of those provisions which allow the


25

party to, in fact, accept service by notice.

29


1

QUESTION:

If this Court writes a due process


2

opinion, can we say that mail, routine mail, is always


3

sufficient, or are there some cases in which you must have


4

personal service? 


5

MR. MINEAR:

6

that.

7

in this case. 


We might caution that it's not necessary to do that


8
9
10

Well, the Court can certainly do


QUESTION:

Well, I want to know what the


principle is that you're -- that controls our case, the

beginning principle here. 


11

MR. MINEAR:

The Court has drawn these


12

principles largely from common experience and knowledge


13

about the instrumentalities that are used for purposes of


14

service.

15

cited that the mails had, through common experience, been


16

determined to be a reasonable means for providing service


17

in that type of proceeding. 


18

And if we looked at the Mullane case, the Court


Now, whether the Court would want to take the


19

step of saying that the mails are always adequate in any


20

proceeding is a step that's not necessary for the Court to


21

take.

22

it ought to do so.

23

this case because this case involves procedures that are


24

very similar to Tulsa, to Mennonite, to Schroeder, to --


25

And so, I'm hesitant to suggest to the Court that


QUESTION:

It certainly does not need to do so in


All right.
30


So, then you are relying


1

on the fact that this is a forfeiture case and we're --


2

there's this voice of the past of in rem versus in


3

personam hanging over this -- this argument of yours. 


4

MR. MINEAR:

Well, actually no, Your Honor. 


5

It's not the in rem nature of the proceedings, but rather


6

it's a -- it's an intersection of two factors. 


7

One, this type of proceeding is similar to the


8

proceedings this Court has dealt with previously that are


9

not necessarily in rem.

For instance, probate claims are


10

not necessarily -- would not necessarily be treated as in


11

rem I think under -- under traditional law.

12

it's the intersection of the fact that these proceedings


13

are similar to proceedings elsewhere that the Court has


14

already ruled on and the fact that this Court can draw on


15

its long experience the mails are, in fact, as a practical


16

matter, a reasonable means for providing service or


17

providing notice.


18

QUESTION:

But it's --


I'm just very puzzled by your


19

reliance on Mullane when Justice Jackson took such care to


20

say this procedure, common trust fund, so many


21

beneficiaries, some unknown, some addresses lost -- if we


22

use regular mail, the chances are it will get to many, if


23

not most, people in the group, and that's good enough for


24

that kind of case.

25

that once belonged to an individual, not 113 trusts


Here we're talking about some $12,000


31


1

combined together in a common fund with hundreds, even


2

thousands of beneficiaries. 


3

QUESTION:

Your Honor, Mullane has been extended


4

beyond the facts of its individual case.

5

is, in fact, quite similar to the Court's most recent


6

decisions, such as Tulsa Professional Services.

7

case, I believe there was some $12,000 in medical fees


8

that were in dispute.

9

couldn't count on other claimants, as in Mullane, to


10

And this case


In that


The -- the creditor in that case


perhaps make the arguments that that creditor might --


11

QUESTION:

Well, but that was with the probate


12

proceeding.

13

and what I've been trying to -- to explore with you, this


14

is a case where a person has an ownership interest.

15

not that much different from an ordinary contract or tort


16

action. 


17

And as Justice Ginsburg's questions point out


MR. MINEAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

It's


And we think that


18

this case is similar to Tulsa and ought to be treated as


19

such.

20

beyond the facts of this case and to deal with the


21

question of a civil complaint and whether ordinary --


22

I'm simply reluctant to urge this Court to go


QUESTION:

I suppose -- I suppose in probate a


23

claimant, a debtor claimant, is in much the same standing


24

as a person who sues in contract on that claim before the


25

person dies. 

32


1

MR. MINEAR:

Well, yes.

But probate is very


2

similar to the situation here, that the notice that is


3

being provided is simply to ascertain whether there are


4

any claims outstanding to the property at issue.

5

person does make a claim, then that initiates a judicial


6

procedure in which further process would be necessary.


7

But this case is --


8

QUESTION:

9

And if a


Here there's no doubt about the


person who has the interest.

It was not like sending out


10

a notice:

11

Government knows who the person in the world is who has a


12

claim to this $12,000.


13

any interested people come forward.

MR. MINEAR:

The


But, Your Honor, the same could be


14

said, for instance, in Mennonite with regard to the


15

mortgagee, that the person who is -- that -- that was a


16

situation in which there was an interest in -- in


17

foreclosing on a property and selling it at a tax sale. 


18

Now, the Government in that situation certainly could have


19

identified the mortgagor and simply provided notice by


20

publication.

21

sufficient.

22

applied in that --


23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MINEAR:

25

QUESTION:

This Court said that notice by mail was

It was the minimum that was necessary and it


-- better than publication generally.

Yes. 

-- publication is the least

33


1

effective, and the Mullane case that you rely on so


2

heavily makes that point. 


3

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, and that's the reason why the


4

Government in these situations provides notice by


5

publication, also by notice to the person's last address,


6

and also notice to his current address if it can be


7

ascertained.

8

reasonable diligence, was able to locate the individual


9

and send notice to his place of incarceration. 


10

In this case, the Government, through


The only thing that distinguishes this case, in


11

fact, is that the mails are being directed to a prison,


12

and the only real question here is whether the prison


13

system is reliable.

14

in fact, it was.

15

that the mails were delivered to prisoners. 


16

And what we established at trial was,


There were procedures in place to ensure


QUESTION:

Fine.

Then you would win even under


17

their rule because then the prisoner would be unable to


18

prove that he didn't get the notice. 


19

So, assume that that's the rule.

The prisoner


20

has to prove he didn't get the notice.

21

-- who actually gets notice loses.

22

like to know is, assuming that, what is the argument


23

against saying where it's a forfeiture case and where the


24

forfeiting -- the person who's going to get the property


25

knows the address of the individual who would forfeit the

34


Anyone who doesn't


Assume that.

What I'd


1

property, that person has to use certified mail?

2

said was the Government does that anyway in forfeiture


3

cases. 


4

MR. MINEAR:

What she


The argument against that, Your


5

Honor, is that the Due Process Clause simply specifies the


6

constitutional minimum.

7

decision to provide more process than is necessary.


8
9

QUESTION:

Fine.

And my question is, what is --


if you're in the Government, aside from -- well, it's a


10

little easier.

11

it? 


12

The Government can make a


Is there any policy reason for not doing


MR. MINEAR:

The reason -- there -- there are


13

several reasons for not recognizing this as a -- a general


14

constitutional standard.

15

have to be applied to other analogous situations at least


16

by a parity of reason-


17

QUESTION:

One is the fact that it would


All right.

And the reason that


18

that's wrong is because?

it other analogous situations.

20

serious problem that would be caused by such a rule. 


21

MR. MINEAR:

I mean, the harm that it will do

Give me an example of some


The rule would, first of all,


22

require, for instance, as the Chief Justice has pointed


23

out, similar service on the armed services.

24

apply to other situations that might not be documented in


25

the record.

It also would


For instance, it's my understanding that the

35


1

Postal Service delivers mail to dormitories and


2

residential halls in bulk for distribution to the people


3

that live in those halls.

4

QUESTION:

So --


So, I want an example, since you're


5

writing the address anyway -- I want an example of the


6

problem that would be caused by saying you not only have


7

to write the address, you also have to send it certified,


8

whether it's to dormitories, armed forces, prisoners, or


9

anyone else in the world.

10
11

What's the actual practical


problem that would cause the Government? 

MR. MINEAR:

Well, I cannot say that the


12

Government cannot overcome that difficulty, because it


13

does in fact use certified mail. 


14

But the problem is should the Court erect that


15

as a constitutional standard, and the difficulties with


16

erecting that as a constitutional standard, as I pointed


17

out before, is it will be very difficult to cabin that to


18

a wide variety of other situations --


19

QUESTION:

With certified mail, you have to get


20

a signature from the recipient, whereas with ordinary


21

mail, you can put it in the slot in your mailbox.

22

other words, it's often difficult to obtain the certified


23

mail signature in a way that it wouldn't be to get the


24

ordinary mail slot.


25

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct.
36


And, for


In


1
2
3
4

example --

QUESTION:

But shouldn't it be difficult if


you're going to take $20,000 away from them? 

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, but again, this case is


5

on -- on par with other cases that involved similar


6

amounts of money. 


7

And with regard to the signature -- obtaining


8

the signature, my suggestion is it might be that the


9

litigation will shift from the assertions that we think in


10

many cases are -- are untrue, that the person did not


11

receive the notice, that, well, a guard signed for me and


12

never actually -- I did not refuse to receive it and a


13

guard simply signed and said that I refused. 


14

What we're trying to do from a policy


15

perspective, from the Bureau of Prisons' perspective, is


16

to eliminate the sort of wasteful litigation that takes


17

place over assertions.


18

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, the Third Circuit has


19

apparently adopted a test that requires the Government to


20

show a little more than that it dropped a notice in the


21

mail, and that, in fact, the Government must show that


22

procedures at the receiving facility, the prison, were


23

reasonably calculated to deliver notice to the intended


24

recipient. 


25

MR. MINEAR:

Yes. 

37


1
2
3

QUESTION:

Is that a -- a standard that the


Government would find satisfactory? 

MR. MINEAR:

We disagree with that, Your Honor,


4

for the reasons set forth in Judge Alito's dissenting


5

opinion on -- on that ground; namely, that it imposes


6

burdens that are not necessary.

7

person who's raising the constitutional challenge to show


8

the deficiency in the procedures, and no deficiency in the


9

procedures has been shown. 


10

QUESTION:

The burden is on the


But your -- your argument, it seems


11

to me, is premised on the fact that forfeiture is like an


12

in rem proceeding and it's just different.

13

-- I'm not sure that this is -- assume that there's a


14

constitutional due process requirement for personal


15

service unless there's some showing of unavailability in


16

the routine case for contract and tort.

17

be any different? 


18

MR. MINEAR:

19

QUESTION:

20
21
22

Why should this


The reason -- the reason why --

That may be an heroic assumption. 


I'm not sure that's true.

I think -- let me go back. 


Do you know of any State which in an ordinary

civil action allows service by mail as a routine matter?


23

MR. MINEAR:

24

QUESTION:

25

Assume with me


I don't know of --

Absent unavailability or the fact


that the person is avoiding the process server or

38


1

something like that? 


2

MR. MINEAR:

I don't know of any State that


3

allows ordinary mail.

4

have adopted certified mail with return receipt requested. 


5

I believe that California follows that pattern.

6

fact, the Federal rules that provide this optional method


7

were based on that -- on that approach.


I believe that a number of States


And in


8

QUESTION:

Okay. 


9

But then -- then going back to the other


10

question, it seems to me your case is premised on the


11

assumption that this is a forfeiture in rem type,


12

different action than -- than a routine contract or tort


13

action.


14

MR. MINEAR:

Well, we certainly do think it


15

falls on the side of the -- of the line that this other --


16

the other cases of this Court demarcs, namely probate


17

proceedings, tax sales, condemnation proceedings, notice


18

of forcible entry and detainer proceedings, which are


19

basically ejectment proceedings.

20

proceedings have involved situations where this Court


21

indicated that notice by ordinary mail would be


22

sufficient.


23

Now, we go beyond that.

24

mail as -- as a matter of policy.

25

important policy --

39


All of those types of


We do provide certified

And it serves an


1

QUESTION:

May I ask you?

This is prompted by


2

Justice Scalia's question.

3

special procedures for people in the military? 


4

MR. MINEAR:

Does the Government have any


I'm not aware of any special


5

procedures that -- that we provide in those situations. 


6

For instance, if there was forfeiture --


7

QUESTION:

And I should think there's a lot of


8

mail that might -- addressed to a serviceman that might be


9

signed for by the mail orderly or something.

10

get the mail.

11

nothing in the record about that, is there? 


12

He may never


I'm just wondering if the -- there's


MR. MINEAR:

No.

There's nothing in the record


13

and it's not clear to me at all that if there was a


14

forfeiture that was directed to a serviceman, it would be


15

treated any differently. 


16

QUESTION:

What about the -- the immunity while


17

the person -- there's an immunity that governs people in


18

the military during the time.

19

statute?


20
21
22

QUESTION:

The Soldier's and Sailor's Civil


Relief Act. 

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, and I'm not sure how that


23

would apply in this situation.

24

the type of requirement --


25

Is it -- what is that


QUESTION:

It might very well toll


It would toll the statute of

40


1

limitations because the person could assert immunity for


2

the period that they're in service.


3

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

I'm simply not certain how


4

that would apply.

5

procedures -- for civil forfeitures, the regulations of


6

the FBI do provide mechanisms such as mitigation and


7

remission that can ameliorate some of the hardships, where


8

a party can actually show that there was nonreceipt.


9

But I do know that for general civil


QUESTION:

But can I ask you a question that


10

puzzles me about this?

11

regulations, there was this special mail category and


12

several things fell into it, including letters that the


13

prisoner would get from the attorney.

14

opened in the presence of the prisoner? 


15

MR. MINEAR:

16

QUESTION:

The -- even before the current


Those have to be


That's correct. 

And then there was this category


17

called law enforcement.

18

character categorized as law enforcement and therefore put


19

within the special mail category? 


20

MR. MINEAR:

And why wasn't a notice of this


I think for a short while the DEA


21

and the FBI did follow the practice of denominating


22

certain mails as special mail.

23

special mail category existed in 1988.

24

record is clear on that. 


25

I'm not sure if the

I don't think the


I would point out, however, that under the

41


1

Bureau of Prisons operations memorandum, there is more


2

protection to providing it by certified mail rather than


3

by special mail, primarily because of the long period of


4

retention of the log books for certified mail.

5

the practice for -- the current practice of BOP --


6

QUESTION:

And so,


That applies to the Federal system,


7

but the rule we're working with today would apply to State


8

forfeitures as well, the State prisons and the like.

9

your rules don't necessarily tell us what would happen in


10

So,


a -- to a State prisoner. 


11

MR. MINEAR:

No, they do not, although I think


12

that the -- the Court can -- can safely assume that State


13

prisons do, in fact, provide for mail delivery to their


14

prisoners. 


15

QUESTION:

Would you just comment on the


16

suggestion that your opponent has made, in effect, that


17

there really ought to be a special rule for people who are


18

in the custody of the Federal Government?

19

with Justice Scalia that would include military personnel


20

too.

21

they know darned well where a person is, there's no reason


22

to have three publications in the local newspaper?

23

just make sure you get it to -- to where the man is. 


24
25

And I assume


Is there -- would it make sense to say that when


MR. MINEAR:

You


Well, there's no reason to depart


-- that's certainly -- the fact that we know where the

42


1

person is, certainly does dictate that we contact the


2

person by mail, and that's inconsistent with Mullane and


3

its progeny, that where the address is reasonably


4

ascertainable, the person should be contacted by mail.


5

The fact that we have the person under our


6

control I don't think adds anything to that.

The basic


7

question is, is this notice reasonably certain to reach


8

the inmate?

9

he's at a location of our choosing or some other location. 


And if it does, it doesn't really matter if


10

It's simply what's important here is, is this method, is


11

the procedure reasonably certain to provide actual notice?


12

QUESTION:

Is there any court action -- if you


13

accepted your -- your points and said, look, they send it


14

to the prison.

15

there, it's certified.

16

it up, and this person did, and then delivers it to the


17

cell.

18

negligently, or deliberately didn't give it to the


19

prisoner.

20

the Tort Claims Act? 


21

It's signed for in the prison.

So, up to


And then a person regularly picks


Suppose the picker-upper either maliciously,


Would the prisoner have any kind of claim under


MR. MINEAR:

I think not under the Tort Claims


22

Act because it does exclude intentional torts.

There


23

might be the -- the opportunity for either seeking redress


24

through the prison administrative remedies or through a


25

Bivens type action.

But certainly the problem there --

43


1

QUESTION:

-- Bivens type action.

It must be


2

that there's a constitutional right or -- I mean, that's


3

-- but -- but is under the Torts Claims Act negligence?


4

MR. MINEAR:

Under negligence?

There is


5

conceivably an opportunity to seek damages based on


6

negligence, although you'd have to show an absence of --


7

of due care.

8

regulations here do certainly provide the sort of


9

reasonableness that we think compliance with would --


10
11

In the case of the Government, the


would satisfy the standard.

QUESTION:

Let me make sure I understand your


12

position on one point.

Is it your view that that even if


13

you had not use certified mail in this case, but just used


14

regular mail and an affidavit by the Secretary that it was


15

mailed and so forth, that that would be constitutionally


16

sufficient? 


17

MR. MINEAR:

18

be constitutionally sufficient.

19

use, with regard to certified mail, are something that we


20

do beyond constitutional requirements in order to --


21

primarily to ensure that we can disprove false claims of


22

nonreceipt. 


23

QUESTION:

Yes.

It's our view that that would

The procedures that we


Mr. Minear, am I correct that the --


24

that the current method of simply providing written notice


25

is -- you -- you maintain that that is method that

44


1

Congress has specified in 19 U.S.C. 1607(a)?


2

MR. MINEAR:

The method of -- the requirement of


3

providing written notice I believe is in 1881, on page 3


4

of our briefs.

5

that -- oh, excuse me.

6

Written notice of seizure, together with information --


And all that Congress has specified is


7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MINEAR:

9

I'm mistaken. 


This is on page 3, Mr. Minear? 

On page 3, and the -- at the end of


the first indented paragraph.


10
11

It is 1607(a).

It provides that written notice of seizure is to

be provided.

It does not specify mail --


12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MINEAR:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MINEAR:

16

QUESTION:

Shall be sent. 

Shall be sent. 

Shall be sent. 

To each party --

What do you think that means?

17

does one normally send things? 


18

MR. MINEAR:

19

think that it's --


20

QUESTION:

Well, normally by mail, and we


It doesn't say shall be sent by


21

certified mail.

22

Congress thought was adequate was -- was by mail. 


23

How


I think it's -- a fair reading of what


MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

I think that by ordinary


24

mail.

And I think -- as I say, the certified mail


25

procedure is something that the Bureau of Prisons and the

45


1

agencies have adopted in order to disprove false claims of


2

nonreceipt.

That's its principal purpose. 


3

But it's our position that ordinary mail is


4

sufficient here as it would be in the wide variety of


5

other cases, comparable other cases, this Court has


6

addressed. 


7

QUESTION:

How do you think the Sixth Circuit


8

standard differs from the Third Circuit's and the


9

Fourth's?


10

MR. MINEAR:

I think as a practical matter, Your


11

Honor, there's primarily a question of the burden of


12

proof.

13

-- if we are challenged, if there's a challenge to whether


14

mail was -- was received or not, it's the obligation of


15

that party who's raising the challenge to prove the lack


16

of reasonableness. 


17

Under the Sixth Circuit's standard, we are simply


QUESTION:

Well, but here the Government is


18

seeking to forfeit property from someone.

19

unreasonable to think that the Government has the burden


20

of proving that notice was given or reasonably calculated


21

to be given. 


22

MR. MINEAR:

Maybe it's not


Well, the Government met that


23

burden in this case, but again, we don't think that that


24

should be the test.

25

obligation of the party to show that -- what defects are


Rather, we think that it's the
