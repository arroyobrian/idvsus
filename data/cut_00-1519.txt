CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Ralph Arvizu.

Mr. Schlick.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10

MR. SCHLICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

Since Terry, this Court has held repeatedly that


11
12

reasonable suspicion analysis requires a common sense


13

evaluation of the totality of the circumstances.

14

decision below is fundamentally inconsistent with that


15

rule because it requires law enforcement officers to


16

disregard potentially relevant facts when determining


17

whether investigative stop is warranted. 


The


This Court's decisions in Cortez and Sokolow are


18
19

especially clear in rejecting attempts to put categories


20

of facts off limits.

21

vehicle's route, the timing of its trip, and its capacity


22

for carrying illegal aliens together established


23

reasonable suspicion, notwithstanding that each of those


24

facts independently might be consistent with innocent


25

travel.


In Cortez, the Court held that a

In Sokolow, the Court rejected a rule that would


2

have limited officers' ability to consider the personal


3

characteristics of suspected drug smugglers.

4

held that that sort of rule adds to the difficulty of


5

applying the reasonable suspicion standard.

6

ease it.

7

facts, facts consistent with innocent travel, in


8

themselves may together establish reasonable suspicion.


The Court


It does not


And the Court further confirmed that innocent

10

establish a rule that would bar categorically

consideration of certain facts that the court deemed

innocent.

problems. 


14

That -- that rule presents two fundamental


The first is that it doesn't accommodate the


15

subtleties of real world encounters.

16

categorical rule, there would have to be exceptions and


17

subrules, and even if law enforcement officers could be


18

asked to master those, they would still then have to


19

anticipate new situations, and those rules could not


20

provide guidance when --


21

QUESTION:

For every


Mr. Schlick, you said this is an area


22

in which one can use one's common sense, and I thought


23

that what the Ninth Circuit was telling us was that some


24

items in that list under all circumstances wouldn't cast


25

suspicion.

And one was -- had a certain familiar ring

1

with me that when you see a police car, you slow down. 


2

This wasn't a car that came to a screeching halt or was


3

trying to dodge it, and then it just slowed down.

4

isn't that a most natural reaction? 

MR. SCHLICK:

5

And


The problem, Justice Ginsburg, was


6

that the Ninth Circuit didn't admit of situations in which


7

deceleration might be relevant.

8

Fifth Circuit's Villalobos case, which we cited in our


9

brief, the law enforcement officer pulled in front of the


For example, in the 


10

vehicle that was suspected.

11

drop back away from the law enforcement officer vehicle,


12

and the Border Patrol officer in that case deemed that


13

suspicious, that it appeared that the vehicle had changed


14

its speed in order to increase its distance from the


15

law --

QUESTION:

16

The vehicle then slowed to


But they weren't talking about that


17

case.

18

what they were saying was that there was nothing


19

suspicious about the slowdown here, and if that's all that


20

you have, it won't do.


21

They were talking about this case.

MR. SCHLICK:

And I thought


Justice Ginsburg, we read the


22

court of appeals opinion as attempting to establish


23

categorical rules.

24

the court says, we attempt here to describe and clearly


25

delimit the extent to which certain factors may be

considered by law enforcement officers in making stops


2

such as the stop here.

3

4

normal response that is in no way indicative of criminal


5

activity.

6

possibility that deceleration may in some context be


7

suspicious. 


8

On the same page, slowing down


That -- that appears not to have made a -- the

Ballesteros case, decided after this case, the Ninth


10

Circuit interpreted its decision in this case as holding


11

that only certain factors may be considered by law


12

enforcement officers when making stops.

13

that categorical rule that is inconsistent with the


14

totality of the circumstances test. 


15

QUESTION:

And it's -- it's


I suppose it would be suspicious if


16

-- if you're on a highway that has not only a maximum


17

speed but a minimum speed, and -- and the car slows down


18

20 miles below the minimum when it -- when it sees a


19

police officer.

20

reaction, would it? 


That -- that wouldn't be a normal


21

MR. SCHLICK:

22

QUESTION:

No.

No, it would not. 


And -- and do you think it's a normal


23

reaction always to slow down when one sees a police -- a


24

police car even if you happen to be going 10 miles below


25

the speed limit already? 


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SCHLICK:

It may depend on the particular


2

area, and that's -- that may be a question on which you


3

would look to the law enforcement officer's experience and


4

expertise.

QUESTION:

5

I don't do it.

Maybe you do it.

But


6

if I'm 10 miles under the speed limit already, I -- I


7

don't immediately slow down when I see a police car.

8

don't know why you are willing to accept that as a -- as


9

an image of reality that everybody slows down when you see


10

a police car.

11

limit, I assume you do.


13

If you're -- if you're going over the speed


MR. SCHLICK:

12

I


I think your intuition accords


with common experience and the holdings of most courts.

QUESTION:

14

There was a concrete record here of


15

what this driver was doing, and he wasn't going 10 miles


16

an hour.

He was going a -- a normal speed.

MR. SCHLICK:

17

Justice Ginsburg, on page 57 of


18

the joint appendix, Agent Stoddard testified that the


19

extreme deceleration in this case, from about 50 to 55


20

miles per hour down to about 25 or 30 miles per hour, was


21

not normal and did set respondent's vehicle apart from


22

ordinary traffic on those roads.

QUESTION:

23
24
25

What was the speed limit on the


roads?

MR. SCHLICK:

Between 25 miles per hour and 35


7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

miles per hour, Your Honor.


2

QUESTION:

And that's what he slowed down to.


3

QUESTION:

That was an established speed limit?


4

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

In -- in the


5

joint appendix, there are photographs which show speed


6

limit signs, and it's 35 miles per hour down near the


7

southern portion of the roads, 25 in the northern portion.

QUESTION:

8
9
10

where he slowed down?

I mean, it was 25 to 35?

was either 25 or 35.

What was it, do you know? 


MR. SCHLICK:

11
12

No.

I -- I don't know for sure.

It


I --


I would guess it was 25, but I don't know for sure.

QUESTION:

13
14

What -- what was the portion where --


But that's what he slowed down to. 


So, he had been going above the speed limit.

QUESTION:

15

That sounds a lot more reasonable


16

then.

I mean, gee, if you don't slow down to the speed


17

limit when you see a police car, you're in big trouble.


18

(Laughter.) 


19

MR. SCHLICK:

Again, Agent Stoddard testified


20

that that sort of deceleration, that speed, was not common


21

in the area, and it --


22

QUESTION:

You mean they just keep zipping along


23

at 50 despite seeing a police car.

24

country is this anyway? 


25

What part of the

1

QUESTION:

2

(Laughter.) 


3

QUESTION:

4

It's Arizona. 


What was the nature of the road?

Was


-- was it a regularly paved road? 

MR. SCHLICK:

5

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

The road


6

on which respondent was apprehended was a dirt road.

It


7

was a road that Agent Stoddard testified is used primarily


8

by the local ranchers and by Forest Service vehicles and


9

by the Border Patrol itself.

It's -- it's not an improved


10

highway.

And it was extremely unusual, Agent Stoddard


11

believed, for a vehicle, a minivan, to be on these roads,


12

and it was a notorious smuggling route. 

QUESTION:

13

Is this one on exhibit 5 of the joint


14

appendix, or have I got the wrong road there?

15

is Kuykendall Cutoff Road and Rucker Canyon Road.

MR. SCHLICK:

16

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

Exhibit 5


The -- the


17

photographs at the back of the joint appendix depict the


18

route.

19

the route up, as you get back to the later pages, toward


20

the northern portion.

21

intersection of Kuykendall Road and Rucker Canyon Road,


22

which is very close to where the apprehension occurred.


23

They -- they moved from the southerly portion of


Exhibit 24, for instance, is the


The maps in the joint appendix on pages 155 and


24

157 show the area at issue.

And you can see the first of


25

those maps on page 155 shows the route beginning at the


9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

bottom of the page in the center, Leslie Canyon Road. 


2

Respondent then -- and that's -- that's paved for about 10


3

miles, about the first 10 miles near Douglas. 


4

Respondent traveled north on that road and then


5

at the T intersection you see approximately in the middle


6

of the page, by which point the -- the roads become


7

unpaved, headed right, away from the Border Patrol


8

checkpoint, away from the highway, which would take you


9

north, through the dirt road, proceeded up Rucker Canyon


10

Road, about three-quarters of the way up the page.

11

an important intersection.


12

QUESTION:

13

right, didn't he? 


Well, he turned left rather than


MR. SCHLICK:

14

That's


I'm sorry.

Turned -- turned right


15

at the intersection, at that T intersection where Leslie


16

Canyon Road jogs right, then stayed on Leslie Canyon Road,


17

took a left on Rucker Canyon.

18

turn. 


19

And that was a critical


Had he gone right, he would have been going


20

towards the only recreation areas in the vicinity.

And


21

that might have explained the presence of cargo in his --


22

in his minivan.

23

appeared to be cargo on the floor of the van.

24

instead turned left, away from the only -- the local


25

recreation area and on a route that, if he then took --


Agent Stoddard could see that there

But he


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

took a right onto Kuykendall Road, which is -- which is


2

again almost in the center of the page near the top


3

between numbers 2 and 3 -- if he took that right on


4

Kuykendall Road, then he would be circumventing the Border


5

Patrol checkpoint which is indicated by number 1 on the


6

left-hand margin of the page.

QUESTION:

7

The idea that he would eventually go


8

north on Kuykendall and then take -- go west to rejoin 191


9

north of the checkpoint.

MR. SCHLICK:

10

That -- that's right, and then


11

head up to I-10, which would allow him to go to Tucson --


12

Tucson or Phoenix, for example.

13

which Agent Stoddard testified is a notorious smuggling


14

route, very rarely used by anyone except ranchers and


15

Forest Service personnel --


16

QUESTION:

17

Although it is a route that could


have been used by people going up to the Chiricahuas.

MR. SCHLICK:

18
19

And it was that route


It's -- it's possible, Your Honor,


but --


20

QUESTION:

From Douglas. 


21

MR. SCHLICK:

-- the district court addressed


22

that possibility on page 22a of the petition appendix and


23

said that that would require a 40 or 50 mile trip over


24

unimproved dirt roads.

25

take I-191 straight up I-181 and then across to Chiricahua


The most logical way to go is to


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

National Monument. 


2

That's particularly significant in this case


3

because the registration of the minivan was to a block


4

that was just two blocks from I-191 in Douglas, and that


5

makes it all the more inexplicable that a -- a vehicle


6

that should know the roads would go out of its way to


7

Leslie Canyon Road, rather than just going two blocks,


8

picking up the highway and heading straight north.

9

know, that's -- that's the route that you would take if it


10
11

You


were a long distance trip. 

I said that the cargo couldn't be explained by


12

the recreation area, because it had already passed the


13

turn on Rucker Canyon Road.

14

a long distance trip because the highway is the road that


15

you would take if you were headed on -- on a long distance


16

with children with suitcases or overnight bags. 


17

QUESTION:

Nor could it be explained by


Mr. Schlick, could I come back to the


18

-- to the slowing -- slowing up?

I'm not quite sure what


19

the -- what the Government's objection to the court's


20

opinion is.

21

true, in the circumstances of this case, that if somebody


22

is barreling along at 50, sees a police car, and slows


23

down to 25, that is not at all suspicious.

24

might consider it suspicious if he continued barreling


25

along at 50. 


I -- I would tend to think that -- that it is


Indeed, I -- I


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

So, you know, if your argument is that in the


2

circumstances of this case, the slowing down was


3

suspicious, I -- I don't think I agree with you.

4

other hand, it is the case that the court of appeals


5

seemed to have -- seems to say that slowing down can never


6

be suspicious. 


On the


Now, which of the two are -- are you objecting


7
8

to?

9

proper suspicion in this case simply because the person


10

Do you really think that -- I mean, that there was


slowed down to the speed limit when he saw the police car?

MR. SCHLICK:

11

In this case, Justice Scalia, the


12

deceleration is -- is not a factor on which the case would


13

turn.

14

I'd like to discuss in a moment. 


15

There were other indications of nervousness which


QUESTION:

Okay.

So, as to that factor, your --


16

your -- really your only objection is you can't be as


17

categorical as the court of appeals put the point. 


18

MR. SCHLICK:

That's -- that's exactly right. 


19

We think it's a good example of the error of the court of


20

appeals' approach. 


21

But in this case, even looking at the factor of


22

nervousness, there were other indications.

After


23

decelerating, respondent drove past the Border Patrol


24

vehicle and stared rigidly straight ahead, without looking


25

at or acknowledging Agent Stoddard, which --


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

At the very


2

page of the opinion that you call our attention to, the


3

court of appeals said, in reaching our conclusion, we find


4

that some of the factors on which the district court


5

relied are neither relevant nor appropriate to a


6

reasonable suspicious -- suspicion analysis in this case. 


7

And are you agreeing with Justice Scalia that the slowing


8

down in this case was not relevant?


9

MR. SCHLICK:

10

it had some relevance.

11

particularly important factor, but it had some relevance. 


12

The -- the court of appeals I think --


13
14

QUESTION:

Justice Stevens, we would say that

It was -- it was not a


Do you think the court of appeals


erred in saying that in this case it had no relevance?


15

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Justice Stevens. 


16

QUESTION:

I see. 


17

QUESTION:

And what about -- what about, you


18

know, not -- not waving to the police car as you go by?

19

don't know when I -- if I were ever exceeding the speed


20

limit and saw --


21

(Laughter.) 


22

QUESTION:

I


-- and saw a police car, it seems to


23

me I would slow down and -- and try to give the impression


24

that I wasn't slowing down because I saw the police car.


25

(Laughter.) 


14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

I mean, you know, you don't hit the


brake and wave at the police officer. 


3

(Laughter.) 


4

QUESTION:

So, why is that a suspicious factor? 


5

I don't see why in the circumstances of this case that's a


6

suspicious factor either.


7

MR. SCHLICK:

Agent Stoddard's testimony was


8

that both respondent and his front-seat adult passenger


9

stared straight ahead.

The respondent gripped the wheel


10

very tightly in -- in a position that Agent Stoddard


11

deemed characteristic of someone who simply wants to melt


12

into their vehicle if possible, and --


13
14
15

QUESTION:

Or maybe somebody who had been going


50 miles an hour in a 25-mile-an-hour zone.

MR. SCHLICK:

Again, Agent Stoddard's testimony


16

was -- was that respondent's behavior was -- was very


17

unusual. 


18

And after he saw those -- those and began to


19

follow the minivan, there was another indication of


20

nervousness, which was at the intersection of Rucker


21

Canyon Road and Kuykendall Road.

22

blinker, well ahead of the intersection, then turned it


23

off, drove towards the intersection, and just before the


24

intersection, made a sharp turn and turned on his blinker


25

again, which again indicated uncertainty or nervousness,


Respondent turned on his


15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which supported the inference that he was unusually


2

distracted by the presence of the Border Patrol vehicle. 

QUESTION:

3

What's the testimony as to the amount


4

of use this particular route got?

5

anything about how many cars a day or an hour came over


6

it?

MR. SCHLICK:

7

How many cars a day,


The testimony, Mr. Chief Justice,


8

was that this road -- the sensor hits on -- the Border


9

Patrol maintains sensors along Leslie Canyon Road and


10

Rucker Canyon Road, and that the first sensor on Leslie


11

Canyon Road, which responded to northbound traffic, was


12

triggered about once every 2 hours. 

QUESTION:

13
14
15

So, that would mean one car every 2


hours? 

MR. SCHLICK:

Correct.

And -- and that's


16

directly relevant to the expected response.

When you're


17

in an area where one car travels approximately every 2


18

hours, you're more likely to acknowledge perhaps a


19

friendly wave -- another vehicle.

20

remote, and again, most of the traffic was local vehicles


21

from -- from the ranches, and the minivan was a vehicle


22

which was not only unusual by type for this road, because


23

it was not a four-wheel drive vehicle, but also had the


24

capability of carrying a large amount of concealed cargo,


25

which made it well-suited to smuggling activity.

This road was extremely


This


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Court noted in Brignoni-Ponce that that is a factor that


2

is potentially relevant when determining whether


3

investigative stop is warranted in the border context.


4

The -- the second problem with the court of


5

appeals approach, in addition to the fact that it can't


6

comprehend the subtleties the real world encounters, is


7

that it's unrealistic to ask officers to put out of their


8

minds facts that they see before them and believe to be


9

relevant.

Even if officers could do that, they would then


10

be left to speculate about the hypothetical import of the


11

imagined set of facts, and that's going to --


12

QUESTION:

One -- one of the things the Ninth


13

Circuit said is just looking at this laundry list and just


14

to throw everything in and mix it all up and say it's


15

suspicious that the driver didn't look at the police


16

officer or didn't wave, but it's equally suspicious that


17

the children did wave.

18

was damned if you do, damned if you don't.

19

that's no good, and if you don't wave, that's no good. 


20

And I think that the -- the Ninth Circuit can't be faulted


21

for saying it's not good enough just to list everything


22

that happened and say it's -- everything the officer could


23

perceive and say it was all relevant.

24

relevant and some of it isn't. 


25

So, one characterization of that

If you wave,


Some of it is


Why would, for example, the children -- how old


17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

were the children, by the way?


2

MR. SCHLICK:

3

QUESTION:

4

And the children were waving in the


back, and something was to be inferred from that? 

MR. SCHLICK:

QUESTION:

9

MR. SCHLICK:

11
12

They weren't simply waving, Your


Without turning toward the Border Patrol

12, 10, and 7.


QUESTION:

They were waving forward. 

Correct. 


And -- and the car -- the police --


the Border Patrol car was behind them.

MR. SCHLICK:

Correct.

It may be expected that


13

a Border Patrol agent would have some experience with


14

children's reaction to him in his vehicle.

15

case he said he -- he hadn't seen anything like this.

It


16

went on for about 4 or 5 minutes.

The


17

children waved together, facing forward without -- without


18

facing Agent Stoddard. 


19

And in this


It was methodical.

With respect to the damned if you do/damned if


20

you don't argument, waving or not waving, the court of


21

appeals ignored the fact that -- Agent Stoddard's


22

testimony was that he deemed it suspicious that when the


23

Border Patrol vehicle was stopped and respondent drove


24

past, respondent didn't acknowledge him at all.

25

that, he turned and began to follow respondent's vehicle,

and it was only at that point that the children began

having failed in his effort to avoid the -- the Border

B, which was we'll attempt to -- to look like a family on

-- on an outing, and one way of -- of perhaps deflecting


7

the agent's suspicion is to have the children wave.

that resulted, from Agent Stoddard's perspective, in a --


9

a very odd circumstance, and that's the exactly the sort


10

So, it's a reasonable inference that

of situation that the reasonable suspicion analysis --

QUESTION:

11

To -- to what extent, Mr. Schlick, do


12

three judges, say, sitting in San Francisco or Los Angeles


13

or nine Justices sitting here -- do we defer to the


14

judgment in these matters of a Border Patrol agent on the


15

scene? 


16

MR. SCHLICK:

Ornelas, among other cases,


17

addressed that, Your Honor, and -- and held that it's


18

appropriate to give due weight to the expertise and


19

experience of law enforcement officers and local judges. 


20

And in this case, both Agent Stoddard and -- and the trial


21

judge deemed this route to be unusual, to be associated


22

with smuggling.

23

factors that I've enumerated to be significant in the


24

context of what was going on out there, and I believe


25

those are the trial judge's words.

It deemed -- the trial judge deemed the


We have to look at

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this in the context of what was going on out there. 

The cargo, for example.

2

He considered the


3

possibility that it might just be camping supplies, but he


4

said that would be -- that would be a possible inference


5

were it not for all the other indications of illegality. 


6

So, he -- he correctly undertook to analyze the facts --

QUESTION:

7

May I ask this question?

I got the


8

impression, in reading the officer's testimony, what he


9

really did is once he checked and found where the car came


10

from, where it was registered in a high drug area, that's


11

what triggered his decision to stop the vehicle.

12

question to you is supposing all he knew was the very


13

unusual circumstances of a family driving in an area


14

that's mostly driven through by ranchers and -- and not


15

families.

16

road, and the -- and the location from which the car


17

originated, would that be enough in your view?


And my


That fact, the rare amount of traffic on the


18

MR. SCHLICK:

19

QUESTION:

If you --


-- put aside all these rather unusual


20

things like waving and slowing down and so forth.

21

those three facts be enough in your view to justify the


22

stop? 


23

MR. SCHLICK:

Would


As -- as I understand your


24

question, no, I don't think they would be.

But when you


25

start adding factors such as missing the turnoff to the


20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

recreation areas, such as carrying the concealed cargo --

QUESTION:

2

Well, missing the turnoff is part of


3

the location, as I say.

The unusual location of the


4

vehicle at the time of the stop.

5

it was not the normal.

You normally see ranchers or -- or


6

Border Patrol people.

You don't normally see families out


7

there.

8

used.

9

-- of the general scene plus the fact that they did --


Is that -- and the fact


That's a -- that's a road that is not usually

Is the -- I'm just wondering if the rarity of the


10

that the officer did check and find that this vehicle was


11

registered in the -- in the area known for drug smuggling,


12

was that enough?

13
14

I think you said no.


MR. SCHLICK:

Is -- in your hypothetical,


Justice Stevens, is the fact that it was a minivan?


15

QUESTION:

Yes.


16

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, yes.

If you knew that it was


17

a minivan, which was out of character, suited to carrying


18

aliens, and knew that the route had been taken, that last


19

turn onto Kuykendall Road, north so that the minivan would


20

not approach the checkpoint, then yes, there would be


21

reasonable suspicion.


22

QUESTION:

In other words, you're saying -- what


23

you're saying I think is that even if the Ninth Circuit


24

were correct in disregarding the waving and the slowing


25

down and the failure to wave once, you'd still have a


21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reasonable suspicion.


2

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

It would be


3

our position that even if you consider only the three


4

factors that the court of appeals considered categorically


5

in the analysis -- that would be the route, the fact that


6

it was a minivan, and the time.

7

Border Patrol was likely to have stepped down its


8

surveillance.

9

those factors, there was no reasonable suspicion.

The time was when the


The court of appeals held if you considered

We


10

would disagree and say even if you only consider those


11

factors, there was reasonable suspicion.

12

appropriate analysis is to consider all the factors


13

collectively, and then clearly there were grounds for the


14

stop. 


But the


15

If the Court has no further questions --


16

QUESTION:

17

I have another question, if -- if you


have the time. 

This checkpoint is about 30 miles north of the


18
19

border.

20

from which the car originated?

21

at what the -- at the setup here, why there's the


22

checkpoint 30 miles from the border, and whether or not


23

there was one closer to the border. 


24
25

Was there also a checkpoint in the --in the town


MR. SCHLICK:

I'm just a little puzzled


There -- there's a border


inspection station in -- in Douglas, but the Court


22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

explained in Martinez-Fuerte the -- the criteria the


2

Border Patrol uses to establish its fixed checkpoints, and


3

I think those criteria continue to hold true today.

4

of them is that the checkpoint should be outside, about 25


5

miles from the border, because 25 miles is the zone in


6

which a border crossing card allows an alien to travel. 


7

So, you would -- so, you would be stopping aliens who were


8

9

card.

14

from the border, rather than just local traffic within


15

16

QUESTION:

Douglas is a

And then the other question I had is


17

about the sensors.

There were two sensors triggered in


18

this case, as I understand the record.

19

the sensors spotted purely in order to identify every


20

vehicle that uses this particular road that this -- this


21

man used?


Are there -- are


22

MR. SCHLICK:

The sensors are magnetic sensors


23

which are directional.

25

smuggling away from the border.

So, they don't pick up southbound


They do pick up all

So, it would pick local --

Well, they picked up not only the


3

northbound, but also the fact that he turned right the

Rucker Canyon Road. 


6

No, left the first time.

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes.

He passed the


In this case there were two


7

sensors.

One was before Rucker Canyon Road.

When that


8

sensor was triggered, Agent Stoddard began to drive


9

towards respondent to -- to check out the sensor hit.

And


10

then a second sensor was triggered after respondent turned


11

left on Rucker Canyon Road and away from the national


12

forest. 


13

QUESTION:

Away from the recreational area. 


14

MR. SCHLICK:

15

Yes. 


16

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Schlick. 


17

Ms. Brambl, we'll hear from you.


That's right.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTORIA A. BRAMBL


19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


20
21

MS. BRAMBL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


22

I wanted to respond to the question that you


23

asked, Mr. Chief Justice, about who should we give due


24

weight to and who is going to know better, the officer in


25

the field, the district court, or the court of appeals. 


24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And certainly the decision in Ornelas v. United States


2

does instruct us that we give weight -- we review for


3

clear error the -- the factual findings that the district


4

court made.

5

the district court makes and -- and that the officer makes


6

are reviewed.

7

those.

8

as for clear error. 


However, inferences from those findings that


They're reviewed giving due weight to


That is not as strict or rigorous as the standard


And then finally, Ornelas -- that decision


9
10

really wanted and instructed the courts -- the courts of


11

appeal to issue opinions that were instructive to firm up


12

the precedent and to offer guidance to everybody, to


13

officers in the field, to litigants, to district courts. 


14

And really, the Ninth Circuit in this case -- they handle


15

the lion's share, over two-thirds of -- or approximately


16

two-thirds of the border stop cases come from the Ninth


17

Circuit.

18

developed both practical experience in seeing these cases


19

over and over again and seeing neutral and rote factors


20

offered over and over again that really don't have any

weight.

several other opinions that they've issued over the last


23

20 or 30 years --

25

They also have developed experience.

They've


And they're instructing through this opinion and


QUESTION:

All those -- that type of opinion


seems to me contrary to our opinion in Sokolow where we


25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said you just can't categorize these kind of factors and


2

say that this kind of thing is never useful and something


3

else is always useful. 


4
5
6

MS. BRAMBL:

I think that all the parties agree


that the totality cannot have categorical rules because --

QUESTION:

Well, then certainly you -- you must


7

-- you're not defending then some parts of the Ninth


8

Circuit opinion.

9

Is that correct? 


MS. BRAMBL:

I think that some of the language


10

that the Ninth Circuit used was inartful in that it made


11

it sound -- if you take one sentence out of the whole


12

opinion, it would make it sound like they were creating


13

categorical rules.

14

whole opinion, in the context, they do cite all of the


15

cases this Court has decided:

16

Brignoni-Ponce, Wardlow.

17

everything.


18

But when you read everything, the


Sokolow, Terry, Cortez,


They say that they consider


But then they go through factor by factor.

And


19

I do defend the way they went about that, separating out


20

the factors and discussing them because it seems that that


21

would be the only orderly way to go about the analysis,


22

and the only way to -- to offer an opinion that really


23

does give some instruction and guidance. 


24
25

QUESTION:

How -- how is that?

I was quite


disturbed actually by the opinion because I thought there


26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

were five or six Supreme Court cases that say this is just


2

the kind of opinion you should not write.

3

went through it, and it says, for example, one of the


4

factors, the fact the minivan slowed, is prohibited by our


5

precedent.

6

all depends.

7

to 10 in -- in 2 seconds, I'd say, why in the middle of


8

the desert did he feel compelled to slow so much?

9

suspect people don't give tickets in Arizona for driving


Well, my own common sense reaction would be it

If he was going 40 miles an hour and slowed


10

50 miles in the middle of the desert.

11

it doesn't say that.

12

So, then I -- I


I -- I


Maybe they do, but


I think it would depend. 


He says that the fact that a van is registered


13

to an address in a block notorious for smuggling is of no


14

significance and may not be given any weight. 


15

Then there are four or five others which are


16

listed where the second factor is of questionable value.


17

The failure -- he has five of them there, which say our


18

precedent says you give no weight. 


19

Now, I just don't see how to square that either


20

with Ornelas, Sokolow, or five other precedents of this


21

Court, as well as with common sense, because it seems to


22

me it would all depend. 


23

MS. BRAMBL:

Well, I certainly agree that --


24

that there may be circumstances in which where you live or


25

slowing down could be.

With respect to the first one,


27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

where they do say squarely prohibited by our precedent,


2

they go ahead and -- and then relate instances where


3

slowing down -- where they do find that this is


4

suspicious.

5

determined, using common sense and -- and I think a lot of


6

the comments this morning illustrate that if maybe not a


7

universal reaction, it's so common to slow down when you


8

see a law enforcement officer, that it's meaningless.


Just merely the act of slowing down they have


9

QUESTION:

Maybe -- maybe we really don't know


10

enough to say that.

11

conversation with the Government's counsel.

12

point of fact, I'm not sure what the reaction is, as -- as


13

Justice Breyer puts it, out in the middle of the desert.


14

For one thing, I don't know whether -- whether


I -- I was engaging in that

But -- but in


15

Border Patrol officers can give speeding tickets.

16

another thing, I don't know whether it's generally known


17

that Border Patrol officers cannot give speeding tickets.


18

And therefore, I don't know whether it's, indeed, quite


19

common out in the middle of the -- of the vast desert of


20

Arizona for people to go barreling along at 50 miles an


21

hour past a Border Patrol agent and ordinarily to wave and


22

say hi. 


23

(Laughter.) 


24

QUESTION:

25

For


These are all matters that I'm sure


the Border Patrol agent was aware of, and perhaps the


28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

district court.

2

appeals out in San Francisco was -- was aware of all of


3

those things.

4

agent and the district court the benefit of the doubt?


5

I'm less certain that the court of


Why shouldn't I give the Border Patrol


MS. BRAMBL:

Well, the agent -- like so many of


6

the factors in this case, the agent didn't really tie down


7

or tie into his experience why slowing down would be


8

predictive or indicative of not just speeding but of


9

criminal activity such as alien or drug smuggling, which


10
11

was the reason that he was out there. 

QUESTION:

Well, he said, people, when they see


12

my Border Patrol car, normally don't slow down.

13

certainly said that, and he found that to be unusual. 


14

Now, why -- why should I think that that is false?


15

MS. BRAMBL:

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19
20
21

Well --

Do you know, as a matter of fact,


whether Border Patrol agents give speeding tickets? 

MS. BRAMBL:

I think that that's an open


question. 

QUESTION:

It's an open question whether they


give speeding tickets?

QUESTION:

24

MS. BRAMBL:

25

He


But I believe that generally --

Don't they have other things to do?

They do have other things to do.

believe that if driving would be characterized as


29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

I


1

dangerous where maybe the public was in jeopardy, that


2

they would be authorized to make a stop, but just because


3

someone is speeding or violating an Arizona traffic law, I


4

don't believe that they would make such a stop.


5

But I wanted to point out that the Ninth Circuit


6

opinion went on, after they said that this factor was


7

squarely prohibited, to say the kinds of ways that slowing


8

down or a deceleration would be indicative of reasonable


9

suspicion or would -- would have some weight.

And they


10

characterized that as evasive driving where -- where


11

perhaps the Border Patrol is seen and then there's an act


12

of evasion as well as deceleration.


13

QUESTION:

Ms. Brambl, the -- the district court


14

ruled for the Government in this case, and the Ninth


15

Circuit reversed.

16

court's opinion, which the court of appeals was -- was


17

reviewing, that same laundry list that appears in the


18

Ninth Circuit's decision.

19

if you just take the district court's opinion, what did


20

the district court rely on that could be questionable? 


21

The district judge did not rely on the children waving, as


22

I recall. 


23

And I don't see that in the district


MS. BRAMBL:

So, what I don't understand is


Well, the district court judge did


24

refer to that, but what's -- what the -- the court of


25

appeals picked up on, which the district court didn't, was


30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

all of the inferences that -- and subjective beliefs that


2

this waving entailed because it wasn't just -- the


3

children were facing forward and waving forward.

4

was a big leap that they were even waving at the agent to


5

begin with and an even bigger leap that the agent made


6

that they were coached to do so, presumably by the driver


7

or the adult passengers.

8

Circuit seized on.


So, it


And that's what the Ninth


9

And another big deficiency with this is how does


10

waving or waving in a mechanical, odd way, as the district


11

court found -- how would that be tied in to criminal


12

behavior?

And the record doesn't indicate how.

QUESTION:

13

How do we know from the record what


14

kind of wave it was?

What -- what he says in his


15

testimony is they kind of stuck their hands up and began


16

waving to me like this.

17

(Laughter.) 


18

QUESTION:

19

Now, the person who saw that was the district


Well, I'm sorry. 


There we are.

Okay? 


20

judge, and the way it was characterized by the policeman


21

is it wasn't in a normal pattern.

23

what he did, it's a little tough for me.

It looked like they


And without being able to see

What the courts both say is it doesn't add


31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The odd thing about the court of appeals opinion


2

is it seems to suggest, because it doesn't prove the case,


3

it's not relevant.

4

to that? 


Now, I -- I mean, what's the response


MS. BRAMBL:

5

Well, I think that -- that goes to


6

the heart of the issue presented by this case, which is


7

what can the court of appeals exclude as factors, even if


8

they do it on a case-by-case basis.

9

factors and just say, you know what, this is so marginally


Can they look at


10

relevant or completely weightless that we're not going to


11

-- to count it in the equation?

12

defend this --

QUESTION:

13

And although I don't


But it does seem as though the Ninth


14

Circuit was trying to suggest that no other court could


15

consider it in the calculus either in the future and --


16

and was making some kind of effort to develop some more


17

rigid guidelines than we've seen in the past.


18

Let me tell you what concerns me very frankly. 


19

We live in a perhaps more dangerous age today than we did


20

when this event took place.

21

from totality of the circumstances in an era when it may


22

become very important to us to have that as the overall


23

test?

24

seemed to be a little more rigid than our precedents


25

require or that common sense would dictate today.


And are we going to back off


And I'm concerned that the Ninth Circuit opinion


32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. BRAMBL:

Well, I certainly agree that


2

totality and reasonableness has to remain flexible, and


3

that given the times that we live in, that perhaps


4

adjustments are going to be made.

5

don't know presents the -- the specter of that. 


6

Thankfully this case I


And it -- it seems that what the Ninth Circuit


7

tried to do in this case was to really provide some


8

meaningful guidance.

9

factors in a very straight forward way without any


They could have just listed the


10

discussion and just said, you know what?

11

together and there's no reasonable suspicion.

12

probably wouldn't be here today.

13

to do I think is to provide some guidance for everybody


14

because when we get these cases as --

QUESTION:

However, what they tried


When we have said that the test is

can be provided by -- by a court is -- is somewhat

MS. BRAMBL:
repetition of factors.

QUESTION:

22

the Ninth Circuit.


23

It is but there's a surprising


MS. BRAMBL:

This Court in --


A surprising repetition of factors by


Well -- well, even this Court in


24

Ornelas recognized that certain fact patterns were


25

similar, such as Sokolow and Royer and a few others, that


33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

really -- given how fact-specific they are, there really


2

is, especially when you start looking in border areas


3

where -- for instance, there are a number of stops where


4

there are checkpoints and -- and people claiming that


5

perhaps these people are on the road for checkpoint


6

evasion purposes. 


7

QUESTION:

Yes, but -- but you know, checkpoints


8

vary too.

The checkpoint north of San Diego is -- is in a


9

heavily populated area where things may be quite different


10

than out here in the Sulphur Springs Valley where there


11

aren't very many people. 

MS. BRAMBL:

12

Well, sure.

It seems that -- that


13

if you look through, for instance, just Ninth Circuit


14

opinions, or if you go over to Fifth Circuit and Tenth


15

Circuit, but also look at the -- the border areas, you do


16

see surprising number of repetition, even though perhaps


17

some are in very urbanized areas and some are in rural


18

areas.


19

QUESTION:

Well, that's -- that's true.

The


20

officers are -- are trained to tell the district court,


21

the finder of fact, all of the factors that entered into


22

their judgment.

24

now have seven factors that every officer in the Ninth

Circuit must memorize and not rely on.

It seems to me, though, a fair reading, a

see how that's consistent with the ability of the police


2

to perform their work or consistent at all with our


3

opinions.

4

us, the Ninth Circuit itself has construed this opinion in


5

subsequent cases precisely that way.


6

And as the court -- as the Government has told


MS. BRAMBL:

Well, the Ninth Circuit, even since


7

this opinion, still examines all of the factors.

8

still look at the totality even in the Sigmond-Ballesteros


9

case that the Government cited in its briefs.

10

QUESTION:

They


However --


You have a point that's a serious


11

point I think.

The first time I see a case where the


12

policeman testifies I -- I stopped this individual because


13

he looked nervous as he came away from the airplane down


14

to the baggage counter, and he looked both ways, and then


15

there was sweat on his upper lip and he walked around the


16

baggage thing, and then, looking around, went over to his


17

suitcase -- the first time you see that, you think, well,


18

that makes sense to me.

19

thing 15 times, you begin to wonder.

20

your point.


21

MS. BRAMBL:

22

QUESTION:

But when you see exactly the same

Now, that I guess is


Well, it -- well, it is.

Okay.

Now, what do we do about that? 


23

I had thought that the way to deal with it is -- totality


24

of the circumstances is the way to deal with it, not


25

having rigid rules that say you can never consider whether


35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

his -- he was sweating or wasn't sweating.

In other


2

words, I don't see how a rigid rule helps.

It puts too


3

many cases on one -- it gets the wrong cases.

4

draw a sensible line. 

Now, what's your view of that?

5
6
7

problem.

It doesn't


I see your


I want to know the solution. 

MS. BRAMBL:

Well, I think that the solution is


8

to allow courts like the Ninth Circuit and other circuits


9

to say, look, we see the same thing time and time again,


10

and it really has very little or no meaning.

11

want you to tell us why this factor is suspicious.

12

not going to be enough anymore to come in and just say, he


13

looked nervous, he slowed down.

14

QUESTION:

Officers, we

It's


And --


But that -- and I -- I think your --


15

your point is -- is well taken as far as you go, but it


16

seems to me that that's not going to help the Ninth


17

Circuit opinion here because what you're saying is don't


18

rely on highly general factors which are so general that


19

we really, in the abstract, don't know where they point. 


20

Be more specific.

21

that's not -- that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.

22

Ninth Circuit, in effect, said, well, we're -- we're


23

simply going to exclude certain categories of fact.


24
25

Give us facts not conclusions.

MS. BRAMBL:

But

The


Well, as I said, the language the


Ninth Circuit used could have been a lot more clear and a


36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

lot more artful.

QUESTION:

2

Well, it might have said what you


3

said, but it didn't say what you said.

4

so?


5

MS. BRAMBL:

I mean, isn't that


Well, they did say frequently, and


6

in effect, when there was a rehearing in this case, they


7

amended the opinion to add under the circumstances of this


8

case and in this case on many, many times. 


9

QUESTION:

Maybe not often enough. 


10

(Laughter.) 


11

MS. BRAMBL:

12

QUESTION:

It would have helped. 

Because -- because initially the


13

opinion did read categorically we don't consider slowing


14

down, we don't consider kids waving, and then they threw


15

in a lot of under the circumstances in this case, not in


16

-- in every instance, but in a number of cases.

17

the amendment seems at odds with what the original opinion


18

was, which seemed to be saying we have three categories


19

here: never relevant, sometimes relevant, always relevant.


20

MS. BRAMBL:

And I think you're right.

That's --


They --


21

I wouldn't say that they were categorical in excluding,


22

but they -- they certainly did seem to suggest that --


23

that certain factors were not relevant, and they did add


24

in this case.

25

with the exact same factor and they're not able to show


And basically if someone comes into court


37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

why that's relevant or probative in this case, why this


2

factor isn't neutral and does have an inference of


3

criminal activity, then that factor, if you follow the --


4

the other courts follow the Ninth Circuit's opinion it's


5

going to -- it's going to be excluded.

6

be considered as relevant or probative. 

I think that that is the kind of guidance that


7
8

It's not going to


the circuits should be offering. 

QUESTION:

9

Well, one thing that the circuit


10

didn't do and it did puzzle me was when I read the


11

district court's opinion, I thought the district court was


12

saying, yes, I could go along with they're in a recreation


13

area.

14

turn, it made no sense at all because if that's where they


15

were going to go, they should have gotten right on the


16

highway.

17

-- the -- the Ninth Circuit didn't deal with that as


18

precisely as the district court did.


19

But when it came to a certain point and they made a


That seemed to be unanswered, that.

MS. BRAMBL:

Why wasn't


That's true, but the Ninth Circuit


20

did point out -- and if you look at the map that's on --


21

on page 157 of the joint appendix -- that's the map that


22

we submitted in connection with this case and that the


23

district and the -- the Ninth Circuit considered -- it


24

shows that -- it's got a lot more detail, as far as a lot


25

of the destinations.

And when the Government said that


38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

really there weren't any destinations beyond Rucker


2

Canyon, beyond where the stop occurred --


3

QUESTION:

4

MS. BRAMBL:

Where you turn onto Kuykendall?

Yes.

Once you turn onto that road


5

and you keep going, you can see to the east there's a


6

number of campgrounds, a number of areas, including --


7

QUESTION:

8

MS. BRAMBL:

9

QUESTION:

The Chiricahua?

Yes. 

Yes, but to go from Douglas to


10

Chiricahua National Monument would be -- would be


11

extremely odd to go the route this minivan took.

12

up -- up 191 and cut over above the checkpoint.


13

MS. BRAMBL:

You'd go


Well, the van was appropriate for


14

that road and the conditions, and I would point out that


15

when the agent had --


16
17

QUESTION:

Well, if it's appropriate, if it's --


it's also appropriate to go on a paved highway, I take it.


18

MS. BRAMBL:

19

QUESTION:

Well, sure, but --

I mean, why would you go up this


20

very winding road to a place that you can get to much more


21

quickly by going up a paved highway?


22

MS. BRAMBL:

It might be a -- a matter of


23

preference and -- and taste.

24

beautiful and --


25

QUESTION:

But these areas are


Well, you know, all of these factors


39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- as Justice Breyer suggested, we're not saying that they


2

would prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or that they


3

would amount to probable cause.

4

about is reasonable suspicion. 

MS. BRAMBL:

5

But all we're talking


But it isn't suspicious for a


6

family from Douglas to use a road that leads right from


7

Douglas, that start out -- that starts out 10 miles paved,


8

to go through a beautiful area up to perhaps Chiricahua


9

Monument or some of the areas along there on the --

QUESTION:

10

Yes.

You can't -- it's obviously


11

nothing criminal.

But what -- what did the respondent


12

say, that he was going to meet somebody there? 


13

MS. BRAMBL:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.

What's -- how does that tie in with


15

going to a recreational area?


16

MS. BRAMBL:

Well -- well, it really doesn't


17

because we know that he was involved in illegal activity,


18

but that's the hindsight of what the officer found after


19

the stop.

And the -- the --

QUESTION:

20

Would you comment on a -- on a phase


21

of the case that keeps puzzling me?

The -- the sensors on


22

the road.

23

suspicion on every vehicle that went up here because I


24

guess the first sensor that was triggered caused the


25

officer to -- to go over and take a look at the vehicle,


It must be that the -- that there was some
