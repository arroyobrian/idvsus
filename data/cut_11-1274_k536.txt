ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS LIMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. LIMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case concerns the statute dealing

12

exclusively with penalty claims brought by government

13

agencies to punish conduct made unlawful by statute.

14

Congress provided a clear and easily administered

15

statutory time limitation on the government's power to

16

punish:

17

Congress.

5 years, except as otherwise provided by

18

The case does not concern -- the statute

19

does not concern the government's power to seek remedial

20

remedies such as disgorgement and injunction.

21

Consistent with -- Congress's normal approach in penal

22

situations, Congress fixed a statute of limitations for

23

penalties.

24

century the statute has been in existence, sweepingly

25

concluded that unless Congress clearly directed

The court below, for the first time over the

3

Alderson Reporting Company

otherwise, the statute and the 5 years did not begin to

2

run from the time the defendant violated the law, the

3

ordinary rule for statutes providing for accrual, but

4

instead --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Liman.

Mr. Liman,

6

you -- you are typing this a penalty case.

The

7

government says yes the accrual is the ordinary rule, but

8

discovery is the rule when there is fraud, and fraud is

9

alleged here.

So how does the Court decide whether to

10

type this case a penalty case, as you urge, or a fraud

11

case, as the government urged -- urges, when both

12

captions fit?

13

MR. LIMAN:

Your Honor, I think there are

14

two answers to that.

15

need to decide, Congress has decided.

16

quite clear that the rule of accrual applied to all

17

penalty claims.

18

Clark v. Martinez, the same word in a statute cannot be

19

given different interpretations depending on the

20

underlying statute to which it is applied.

21

First is that the Court doesn't
Congress made it

And as this Court held in

The second reason, though, Justice Ginsburg,

22

is that it is not correct to say, and this Court has

23

never said, that either the Bailey rule or the injury

24

accrual rule applies to a statutory fraud claim where

25

the government is seeking to punish.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Excuse me.

2

Justice Ginsburg points out that you're talking about

3

the statute, but the statute uses the term "accrual."

4

Is it correct to say that the term "accrual" is not used

5

in statute of limitations for crimes -- generally -- for

6

crimes?

7
8

MR. LIMAN:

For -- for crimes, the general

word that is used is time period from the violation.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.

And this -- and

10

this talks about accrual.

11

indicative of the fact that Congress is using a civil

12

analogue in the drafting of this statute.

13

MR. LIMAN:

So that is indicative -- is

Your Honor, it indicates that

14

Congress is using accrual as it is understood at common

15

law.

16

and the plaintiff has the ability to sue.

17

means is, as the D.C. Circuit said in 3M -- and we think

18

the D.C. Circuit got it right on this -- that you look

19

to the underlying statute pursuant to which the

20

government is seeking a penalty to see when the claim

21

became ripe.

22

Common law, it means when the claim becomes ripe
What that

In a penalty situation, and under the IAA,

23

which is what this concerns -- it doesn't concern a

24

common law fraud claim; it doesn't concern a claim where

25

there's even any element of deception that's required.

1

It's a breach of fiduciary duty.

2

that the government can sue when the violation occurs.

3

Now --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What the IAA says is

Mr. Liman, I understand

5

your argument, but I have a fundamental difficulty,

6

okay?

7

Bailey and Exploration Company, with

8

statutes not too dissimilar from this one, who read the

9

discovery rule into a fraud claim, both for a civil

10

litigant and for the government.

The only way that I

11

can tease out a potential difference between Exploration

12

and this case is somehow that the penalty in this case

13

is not for injury, but for punishment, as you called it.

14

Government as enforcer, rather than government as

15

victim.

16

Some of us would say that the common wheel

17

is injured whenever someone breaks a law, so that that

18

distinction between enforcer and victim makes no sense.

19

How do you answer that point?

20

MR. LIMAN:

Justice Sotomayor, let me give

21

you the precise answer to that, which is that in this

22

case where the government is seeking a penalty, it is

23

not acting on behalf of underlying investors, and the

24

recovery is not one that is brought by way of damages or

25

disgorgement.

That -- that's the best -MR. LIMAN:

Your Honor, I think that is the

articulation that the government would have to make.

7

don't think it holds up, for several reasons.

8

all, it would represent an extreme departure from

9

anything this Court has ever held or, to our knowledge,

10

any court has ever held with respect to the application

11

of the discovery rule.

12

First of

Second, when you're talking about penalty,

13

you're not talking about recovery to -- to victims.

14

Third, when we're talking about implying a rule, which

15

is what the government's argument is here -- it's not an

16

argument to follow the plain language, it's an argument

17

to depart from the plain language -- you should look at,

18

and the cases direct you to look at, the policy

19

concerns.

20

discovery rule with respect to the government as

21

enforcer, the rules don't work.

22

several reasons.

And when you're talking about discover -- a

They don't work for

23

First of all, when you've got an injury, a

24

party who is injured, the statute of limitations has a

25

natural start date that is not in control of the
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiff.

There is a relationship to the underlying

2

violation.

And that can be readily measured.

3

that is true when you're talking about the government in

4

a law enforcement capacity.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

None of

Mr. Liman, what you

6

suggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is

7

that it has its basis in the notion that a defendant with

8

unclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct

9

preventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or

10

it has a cause of action -- you know, shouldn't be

11

entitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations.

12

And if that's the understanding that lies

13

behind the discovery rule, I guess the question for you

14

is, why doesn't it apply in this case, as well as, in

15

a case where the person bringing the action has

16

himself suffered a harm?

17

MR. LIMAN:

Justice Kagan, I've got two

18

answers to that question as well.

The first is that --

19

that I don't think is the basis for the -- for the

20

discovery rule at bottom.

21

rule -- if you look at this Court's opinion in -- in

22

Rotella, if you look at the Seventh Circuit in Cada, the

23

D.C. Circuit in Connor -- is the notion that when the

24

plaintiff cannot discover the injury, doesn't know that

25

it's been injured, and cannot reasonably know that the

The basis for the discovery

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiff's been injured, the plaintiff cannot take the

2

steps that other plaintiffs would take to investigate

3

and determine whether they've got a cause of action.

4

That's not applicable in a government

5

enforcement context because you're not talking about

6

there the government as a victim.

7

not know of the underlying transaction, will not know of

8

the underlying transaction, unless the government asks.

9

The second reason is that there is a strain

The government may

10

that -- in the Bailey line of cases -- that really

11

speaks in terms of equitable tolling and fraudulent

12

concealment, that sort of a notion of unclean -- unclean

13

hands.

14

affirmatively took it out.

That's not in this case because the government

15

But we would submit --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How did the government

16

take it out?

I mean, the point here is that there was a

17

concealment.

There was a hiding of what was -- the

18

impermissible action.

19

MR. LIMAN:

That's -- that's not correct,

20

Justice Ginsburg.

If you'd look at the -- at the

21

opinion below and you look at the complaint, the essence

22

of the allegation, which we have not yet had a chance to

23

disprove before you on a motion to dismiss, is that

24

there were misrepresentations and omissions made to the

25

board of the mutual fund.

There was no

anything was hidden from the government or was in any

way concealed from the government.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The records here

Mr. Liman, finishing up

9

a point you were just on previously, what's your

10

position with respect to fraudulent concealment?

11

Doesn't your theory preclude even the application of

12

that to tolling of the statute?

13

MR. LIMAN:

Your Honor, I think you could

14

and should conclude -- that if you reach that issue.

15

don't think you need to reach that issue.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Our theory doesn't require you

to come to that conclusion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

you to say that.

21

theory, how the next step is avoidable?

theory would we say you can't have a discovery rule, but

23

you can have a fraudulent concealment rule?

Your Honor, in the -- using the

same type of theory and the same methodology that the
10

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Court employed in the RICO context, in the Claire case,

2

and in the Rotella case, one can read the statute, I

3

think you have to read the statute, here to say that

4

"accrue" means accrue.

5

government can first sue.

6

It's the time that the

That does not necessarily resolve the

7

question of whether there are equitable exceptions that

8

the government or any party could affirmatively assert

9

to toll the statute of limitations, not to delay the

10

accrual of the statute of limitations.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. -- Mr. Liman, you

12

acknowledge that a civil action could be brought

13

beginning from the time when the injured plaintiff

14

discovers the fraud, right?

15

MR. LIMAN:

That's --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're really not

17

arguing for what you might call a total statute of

18

repose.

19

relieved from prosecution by the government, but not

20

relieved from a suit for sometimes very substantial

21

damages by -- by an injured plaintiff who doesn't have

22

to sue until he's discovered the fraud.

It seems to me odd that the defendant would be

23

MR. LIMAN:

Your Honor, respectfully, we

24

don't think that's not odd at all.

25

securities context, there is a 5-year statute of repose.

If you look in the

And it would be odd to think that the same Congress that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that 5 years

doesn't begin to run until the private plaintiff

Mr. Liman, how does it

work with a disgorgement remedy?

18

still -- that you are not challenging the disgorgement?

MR. LIMAN:

I take it that that's

We are not challenging the

20

disgorgement in front of this Court, and if this Court

21

reverses the Second Circuit that -- that issue will

remain in the case and the SEC's claim for disgorgement

One of the notable features,

19

Congress uses penalty -- acknowledges that Congress has

20

used penalty when -- the word "penalty" when the

Congress has -- I'm sorry, it has used the word

"discovery" when Congress has wanted the statute to --

23

that the underlying case has a 5-year statute of repose

date for the statute of limitations is not in the

16

It's critical in this Court's jurisprudence from Hubrick

forward.

18

the injury would be known to a reasonable plaintiff.

19

Not true with respect to the government, who may not

even know of the transaction.

21

it's -- I don't think there's an anomaly because there

22

are different statutes of limitation.

23

We don't think it's an

First of all, in the private

That's a critical point.

It -- there is a natural start date from when

24

would be that a case like Exploration, it's different

25

than this case because it does have a natural start
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

date; is that the idea?

2

MR. LIMAN:

Number one, it does.

And number

3

two, the relief being sought in Exploration was the

4

cancellation of a patent, so it was the government as a

5

party to a transaction.

6

in Exploration, what the Court, in fact, said in

7

Exploration, is that there is no reason why the same

8

rule applied the same way couldn't benefit the

9

government, as well as the private plaintiff.

And what the Court really said

10

What the government is seeking here is not

11

the same rule and would not be applied in the same way

12

because you are talking about a transaction that is a,

13

frankly, a private transaction that there is no reason

14

that the government would know anything about.

15

claim ultimately here is a claim about what was said in

16

a private conversation between the advisor to a mutual

17

fund and the mutual fund -- fund board.

18

The

So Exploration, what's notable is that the

19

government doesn't cite a single case where the

20

discovery rule has been applied to a party who is not a

21

victim or that it's been applied -- where it's been

22

applied and a penalty hasn't been -- a penalty has been

can that plaintiff, the injured investor, the private

11

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I think Justice Kennedy started us off in

12

the right place by focusing on the statute and its use

13

of the term "accrual."

14

that term had an established meaning at common law and

15

this statute picks it up, I think he gave away his case

16

because there were a cluster of concepts.

17

general rule governing accrual:

18

plaintiff can -- has a right to sue.

19

And when counsel concedes that

One was the

20

of fraud and concealment.

21

any basis in law or logic for Petitioner saying that

22

this statute meant to pick up one of those concepts and

23

not the other concept.

24
25

And I don't think there is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think the common

law held that it didn't accrue.

I think it was an

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exception to the accrual rule, that, even though it

2

accrued earlier, we are going to allow a later suit

3

where -- where discovery is made later.

4

the way those cases were framed, that it didn't accrue

5

until discovery?

6

MR. WALL:

I -- is that

Justice Scalia, I don't want to

7

fight about it too much because from the government's

8

perspective, it doesn't matter --

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you are making the

argument, so you ought to fight about it.

11

MR. WALL:

It doesn't matter how it's

12

labeled.

It doesn't matter whether we label it as an

13

interpretation of the statute or an exception for cases

14

of fraud or concealment.

15

The result is the same.

But I will say you are right, in some cases

16

it was described as an exception, but as long ago as

17

Kirby in 1887 and as recently as Merck --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And never in a criminal

19

case, right?

Do you have a single case in which the

20

discovery rule was -- was applied in a criminal case

21

with respect to a penalty or a criminal sanction?

22

MR. WALL:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. WALL:

25

No, not in -Not a single one.

Well, no.

is fundamentally different.

The criminal context

This Court has said that

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

those statutes are construed liberally in favor of

2

repose and are presumptively not subject to --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, that's the question

4

because I certainly agree with Justice Scalia that this

5

is not an SEC statute, this is not a securities statute;

6

it is a statute that applies to all government actions,

7

which is a huge category across the board and it's about

8

200 years old.

9

And until 2004 I haven't found a single case

10

in which the government ever tried to assert the

11

discovery rule where what they were seeking was a civil

12

penalty, not to try to make themselves whole where they

13

are a victim, with one exception, a case called Maillard

14

in the 19th century where they did make that assertion.

15

They were struck down by the district court, and the

16

attorney general in his opinion said, the district

17

court's absolutely right; of course, the government

18

cannot effectively abolish the statute of limitations

19

where what they're trying to do is to gather something

20

that's so close to a criminal case.

21

So my question is:

Is there any case at all

22

until the year 2004, approximately, in which the

23

government has either tried or certainly succeeded in

24

taking this general statute and applying the discovery

25

rule where they are not a victim, they are trying to
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

enforce the law for the civil penalty?

2

The reason I brought up Social Security,

3

Veteran's Affairs, Medicare, is it seems to me to have

4

enormous consequences for the government suddenly to try

5

to assert a quasi-criminal penalty and abolish the

6

statute of limitations, I mean, in a vast set of cases.

7

And that -- you know, I have overstated that last remark

8

a little bit, but I want you to see where I'm coming

9

from, which isn't so different from the -- from the

10

questions that have been put to you.

11

MR. WALL:

Justice Breyer, most or many of

12

the penalty claims that are being brought under Section

13

2462 and other penalty statutes don't deal with fraud or

14

concealment, and I grant you that it is a problem -JUSTICE BREYER:

15
16

one case.
MR. WALL:

17
18

All I'm asking you for is

So in -- it's a problem of fairly

recent vintage, to be sure -JUSTICE BREYER:

19

No, it is not a problem of

20

fairly recent vintage.

I'd say for 200 years there is

21

no case.

22

discover, which is why I am asking, is that what created

23

the problem of recent vintage is that the Seventh

24

Circuit, I guess, or a couple of other circuits decided

25

that this discovery rule did apply to an effort by the

The only case, as far as I have been able to

24

Official

1

2

created the problem.

3

it was clear the government couldn't do it.

4

That's what

Before that there was no problem;

All right.

Now, you will tell me that I'm

5

wrong by citing some cases that show I'm wrong.

6

that's what I'm asking.

7

sort of.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. WALL:

And

I want to be told I'm wrong,

And I guess what I want to tell

10

you is there aren't cases out there one way or the

11

other.

12

adopt the discovery rule in the context of fraud or

13

concealment with civil penalty actions --

There aren't cases endorsing or declining to

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You'd expect that - you'd

15

expect there to be some cases in a couple of hundred

16

years.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I haven't found one.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Fraud is nothing new, for

19

Pete's sake.

20

MR. WALL:

Justice Scalia, it's not that --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This is brand-new assertion

22

by the government that -- tell -- is there much

23

difference between the rule you are arguing for and a

24

rule that there is no statute of limitations?

25

MR. WALL:

Absolutely there is.

of those areas that Justice Breyer catalogued?

14

MR. WALL:

How

There are cases from the 1980s

there is none.

was not trying to recover money or land that it had

23

said that the discovery rule applies.

24
25

What I want is a case before the year

The two that you cited, Amy and the case of
Broderick's Will, did involve the government being
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

injured by losing land or losing money, something like

2

that.

3

I will look at them again.

4

would like to refer me to?

So I have those and I don't think they count, but

5

MR. WALL:

Is there anything else you

Justice Breyer, I don't think

6

there is anything on either side of the ledger, I will

7

be very upfront, other than the Maillard case, which I

8

think even courts at the time, an exploration company,

9

the court of appeals recognized --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not a matter of there

11

being nothing on either side of the ledger.

12

extraordinary is that the government has never asserted

13

this, except in the 19th century, when it was rebuffed

14

and -- and repudiated its position.

15

there are no cases against you.

16

the government has never asserted it before.

17

MR. WALL:

What's

It isn't just that

It's you've never --

Justice Scalia, there were very

18

few civil penalty actions in which -- that involved

19

fraud or concealment, in which the government would have

20

needed to invoke it, or did invoke it and was rebuffed

21

by courts.

22

the question is do all of the same concepts that

23

compelled one answer in these other contexts compel the

24

same answer here or does a rule that blankets the

25

waterfront -

I mean, this is a fairly modern problem, and

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, this is a very

2

modern problem, but how about the statute of Elizabeth,

3

which talked about penalties as being a criminal

4

sanction, but permitted private individuals, not the

5

government, to seek the penalties and keep it.

6

cite the statute of James, and I look at the statute of

7

Elizabeth, and try to find the analogy between which

8

one.

9
10

MR. WALL:

Well, if this were a criminal

penalty, the government agrees --

11
12

So you

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Even though private

parties could keep the money back then.

13

MR. WALL:

That's right.

But what the

14

Court's been clear on is that there are civil penalties

15

and there are criminal penalties and which side of the

16

line it falls on invokes a different set of background

17

rules and legal norms.

18

a civil penalty --

The Congress denominated this as

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

Could I move you to

20

another issue?

If a party can defeat the government's

21

claim of discovery by showing that the government wasn't

reasonably diligent, how does a party ever accomplish

23

that?

25

discovery?

Aren't you going to raise the law enforcement

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. WALL:

Justice Sotomayor, discovery is

2

playing itself out in cases like these in district

3

courts.

4

the reason is defendants are by and large pointing to

5

things in the public domain -- private lawsuits, public

6

filings with the Commission, public statements -- to say

7

those put the Commission on constructive words --

8
9

Privilege has not been a very major issue and

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, if they fail

there, don't you think that they are going to also fail

10

because they are not going to be able to look at your

11

records to figure out exactly what you knew or didn't

12

know?

13

MR. WALL:

No, not invariably.

I mean, the

14

way this plays itself out in the district court is the

15

Commission says that it didn't know and a defendant

16

points to something in the public domain and says either

17

that put you on constructive notice or --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it depends really

19

on how many enforcement officers the SEC has, is it

20

reasonable for them to have been aware of the particular

21

item in some publication.

22

people reviewing it, but maybe not if they have 10; and

23

that's just not the -- I mean, it's not just the SEC;

24

it's all these other government areas.

25

Maybe if they've got 1,000

It seems to me that it's going to be almost

impossible for somebody to prove that the government

2

should have known about something.

3

4

particular agencies -- well, you say, well, the Defense

Contractor Board should have known, but does that mean

6

that the U.S. attorney's office or the Defense Counsel's

7

office should have known?

And which part of

I mean, it's a big, big government, and

8

It seems to me that, at least with respect

9

to that aspect, you really are eliminating any real --

10

it's certainly not a lot of repose if the idea is, well,

11

I've got to establish that this particular government

12

agency should have known about this.

13
14

You certainly can't sit back and say, well,
5 years has gone by and --

15

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, they can't

you should expect those cases to exist, yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

Are -- are there cases

3

discussing whether or not a government agency has been

4

diligent in pursuing a fraud, a fraud investigation?

5

You see, in the private context we have some sense of

6

what the plaintiff has to do to protect the plaintiff's

rights.

8

to a governmental agency -- suppose the agency's over --

9

overworked or underfunded?

10

He has to be diligent.

But to transpose that

I don't -- which way do you

come out when the government says that?
MR. WALL:

11

Justice Kennedy, not just this

12

statute.

13

and others, that have specific provisions requiring

14

courts to determine when a government official would

15

reasonably have been on notice of certain circumstances.

16

That hasn't proven difficult in those contexts.

17

not difficult here.

There are other statutes, the False Claims Act

that Justice Kennedy just asked?

it had more resources, but given the resources that it had

it couldn't have reasonably discovered the claim?

the discovery rule apply there?

8

case.

16

think the word "accrual" is, at best, ambiguous,

17

shouldn't the tie go to the defendant?

18

But we are talking here about prosecution,

By the way, doesn't the rule of lenity

MR. WALL:

No.

So if I

The court's been very -- I

19

mean, in all of the civil cases applying the fraud

discovery rule, the court has never looked to the

The canon here is that ambiguities

Does the rule of lenity not apply to all

32

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. WALL:

I don't think it applies in the

2

context of a civil penalty.

don't think the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are you sure of that?

My

belief is the contrary.

6
7

I don't think the -- I

MR. WALL:

I can't say that I focused on it

specifically, but I think if the Petitioner said --

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's an important

9

issue in this case, surely.

I mean, if "accrual" is

10

ambiguous and we have a rule of lenity, we should

11

interpret it to favor the defendant.

12

MR. WALL:

Justice Scalia, I don't --

13

Petitioner certainly couldn't claim that this civil

14

penalty should have to be proved beyond a reasonable

15

doubt, or that they are entitled to a constitutional

16

right to counsel.

17

them all should change in the civil context and not the

18

others.

19

I don't know why one legal norm among

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason would be that

20

the -- you know, once you start talking about applying

21

this to Social Security, for example, or to Medicare,

22

for example, or to DOD, for example, you have somebody

23

who did commit some fraud and they kept the money.

24

know, she had five children not four, or she has five,

25

not six.

You

And I can understand it being fair when the
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

government catches her -- you know, 18 years later, they

2

say, We want our money back.

3

not necessarily merciful, but fair.

4

Okay.

I say that's fair,

But then to go and say, and in addition we

5

want this civil penalty, even though -- of course, we

6

couldn't have discovered it.

7

million people who get Social Security or 40 million or

8

something, and we can't police every one.

9

suddenly, I see I am opening the door, not just to

Don't you know there are 4

And so

10

getting your money back, but to also you're having what

11

looked like criminal penalties years later without much

12

benefit of a statute of limitations.

13

That is at the back of my mind.

And I'd

14

like to know, having brought it up front, what -- what

15

your response is.

16

MR. WALL:

Absolutely.

There are anomalies

17

on both sides of the coin and I just want to touch on

18

both very briefly.

19

situation, the defendant's fraud or concealment

20

would allow it or him to escape paying civil penalties,

21

but not private damages.

Take the example you gave.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. WALL:

In that

That's right.

This Court has never privileged a

24

private lawsuit above a government enforcement action in

25

the securities context -
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

But this is not the

2

securities context.

3

why I started down the road I was down.

4

This is the context of -- that's

MR. WALL:

But even in that context, imagine

5

if there's a private right of action, the private

6

plaintiff will be able to recover damages and the

7

government will not --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, because you have two

people who are hurt, where two people have been hurt.

10

For example, I wrote the case in Burk and we had the

11

statute of limitations and Congress focused on this.

12

And it wrote a two-tier statute.

13

two-tier statute in large part because it was concerned

14

about the problem you mention.

15

you're either going to let the defendant keep the money

16

or the victim gets it back.

17

is not that context.

18

where not only are you getting your money back, but you

19

also want to assess a kind of criminal penalty.

20

that situation, I see a pretty clear line and I don't

21

understand why the government is so anxious to change

22

what has long been the apparent --

23

And it wrote a

You have a victim.

So

I understand that, but this

This is like a criminal context,

MR. WALL:

And in

Justice Breyer imagine the opposite,

24

which is far more dangerous.

Imagine a bank makes a bad

25

loan to a veteran, or a bank tells the FDIC that it's gotten

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mortgage insurance to help lower income families buy

2

homes, and then that fraud or falsity escapes detection

3

for five years.

4

then is barred from bringing a civil penalty action, and

5

there is no private right of action.

6

The Veterans Administration or the FHA

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct, you have a

7

fraud and you can't put them in jail either, but you can

8

get your money back.

9

MR. WALL:

But the reason there's no private

10

right of action in those contexts is, in part, because

11

government agencies can seek civil penalties.

12

cannot imagine that the Congress, which allowed agencies

13

to seek civil penalties, where here they had existing

14

remedies, would have thought that the only people who

15

could get away without paying them are the ones who

16

commit fraud or concealment and that remains hidden for

17

five years.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I

And the reason --

19

the reason there's no private action -- right of action

20

is not because the government could seek civil

21

penalties, it's because Congress hasn't provided a

22

private right of action.

23

MR. WALL:

That's right because it thought

24

that the agencies could seek civil penalties and that

25

was sufficient.
36

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, no, your case--

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it didn't -- it

3

didn't necessarily think, and that's why we have a case,

that they could seek civil penalties 10 years later,

5

18 years later, however long, so long as they were busy

6

doing other things and didn't have a chance to know.

7

MR. WALL:

No question.

And in the average

clear.

apply, though Petitioners or others like them will be

the point earlier that it would be very odd that it's

it's the sovereign that's bringing the action that the

know, the sovereign, with all of its resources, can

decide to go after whomever it discovers, however many

Second, the concession that you just heard a

13

moment ago, that the statute would not apply as the

14

government says it should apply if this was deemed to be

15

a criminal penalty, we submit under this Court's

16

reasoning in Clark v. Martinez, it just gave away the

17

store in the government's case because if it is

18

possible -- as the government has now admitted it's

19

possible -- and I don't want to get into all of the

20

permutations of Hudson -- but if it is possible that the

label of civil penalty does not -- is not dispositive as

22

to whether a penalty is civil or criminal, then, as the

23

Court held in Clark v. Martinez, the lowest common

24

denominator applies.

25

One has to interpret this statute so that it

2

that's so, then it follows, it runs from accrual as that

3

word is commonly understood.

4

Next point.

And if

The government said that there

5

are no cases where the Court considered the -- the claim

6

that it is making.

7

to the Rotella case, in which in the context of a

8

private plaintiff, who did not have the resources of the

9

government, the argument was made that the RICO statute

10

We would point the Court's attention

should have a discovery of the violation-type principle.

11

And the argument was made there that RICO

12

can encompass a pattern of fraudulent acts.

13

plaintiff in that case said, as the government says

14

here, fraud can be concealed, can be complex, can be

difficult to discover.

23

We would point

with respect to our questions about its investigations

of the counterparty to this alleged quid -- quid pro

4

The Court also asked a question of whether

5

there are any cases in which courts have dealt with

6

government agencies being diligent, and the claim being

7

the government agency was not diligent.

8

dealt with that in a related context, in the

9

Heckler v. Cheney context.

The Court has

And in the Heckler v. Cheney

10

context the Court held that type of issue, how an

13

not, whether it chooses to believe that they are in

14

15

administering is not fit for judicial review.

16

different result should apply here.

17

Just two more points.

No

The False Claims Act

18

has a -- which has an explicit discovery rule, also has

19

a statute of repose.

20

the one circumstance where Congress, one of the few

21

circumstances where Congress chose to use the word

22

"discovery," was where the government was injured, and

23

they -- Congress chose to impose a statute of repose,

24

where, as they say in the 100 or other statutes that use

25

language, fraud-like language, Congress intended there

It would be very odd, indeed, if

53

Alderson Reporting Company

to be discovery and no repose.

2

And that really ties into the last point,

3

which is that there are, by our count, if you look at

4

fraud, misleading, false statement-type statutes, there

5

are somewhere like 80 or 100-type statutes that use that
