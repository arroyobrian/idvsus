 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear

5

States v. Castleman.

 Ms. Sherry. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 
 Section 922(g)(9) was enacted to protect 

12

battered women and children and to close a dangerous 

13

loophole in Federal law that allowed domestic abusers to 

14

possess firearms. 

15

 That loophole existed because many domestic 

16

abusers were only convicted of misdemeanor offenses, and 

17

the misdemeanor offenses they were most often convicted 

18

of were assault and battery crimes. 

19

 Respondent asks this Court to adopt an 

20

interpretation of 922(g)(9) that would indisputably 

21

exclude the assault and battery laws of almost all of 

22

the 50 States and the District of Columbia.  That would 

23

render the statute a virtual dead letter from the moment 

24

of its enactment until today, and it would leave that 

25

dangerous loophole wide open.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 The statutory text does not compel that 

2

implausible result.  To the contrary, this Court 

3

ordinarily presumes that common law terms of art bear 

4

their common law meaning, and here, the common law 

5

meaning of force is a natural fit. 

6

 It makes perfect sense to define a 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I'm a little bit 

8

concerned about going to that common law meaning.  Why 

9

don't you go to what the common law meaning of domestic 

10

violence is?  I thought that was your strongest 

11

argument.  Because isn't that different than just 

12

violence? 

13

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Oh, it certainly is.  Though 

14

the connotation of the phrase "domestic violence" is 

15

very different than the word  the word "violence" 

16

standing alone. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Exactly. 
And it's certainly 

19

different than "violent" when it's modifying the word 

20

"felony."  Domestic violence describes a broad spectrum 

21

of abusive behavior 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Misdemeanor domestic 

violence. 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Misdemeanor crime of 

domestic violence.  So both the word "misdemeanor" and

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the phrase "domestic violence," it's a broad spectrum of 

2

abusive behavior.  It's characterized by a pattern of 

3

escalating abusive conduct. 

4

 It may start with something like emotional 

5

abuse, include isolating the person from friends and 

6

family, include threats of violence, threatening to take 

7

away the kids.  And it 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Are threats of violence 

domestic violence? 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

They are, not in this 

not with respect to this particular statute. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I hope not.  I hope not. 
No, and in this particular 

14

statute, Congress focused on a particular form of 

15

domestic violence.  It's wellaccepted within the 

16

community that threats are a form of domestic violence, 

17

but Congress here 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do we have to think that 

19

domestic violence is different from violence?  Wouldn't 

20

the simple term "violence," without the "domestic" 

21

adjective cover any physical abuse that causes harm? 

22

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

It would, but, I mean, 

23

domestic violence  my point here is that domestic 

24

violence has a different connotation, even if you were 

25

to move away from the phrase "domestic violence," Your

5

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Honor, this statute does talk about misdemeanor crimes 

2

of domestic violence, and that's the term that we are 

3

defining here. 

4

 In Johnson, this Court recognized that it 

5

normally does presume that common law terms of art bear 

6

their common law meaning, and if

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

Yes, that is violence. 
Okay.  So do you have to 

have a special rule for if I punch my wife in the nose? 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

No, and we're not 

arguing 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Any physical action that 

hurts somebody is violence, isn't it? 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

It certainly is, and we 

21

are not arguing for a special rule here.  What we're 

22

saying is that 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How about pinching or 

24

biting, hair pulling, shoving, grabbing, hitting, 

25

slapping; would those be violence or would they be

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

domestic violence if you are doing it against a spouse? 

2

Would they in all situations be violence? 

3

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

If you are doing it 

4

against a spouse it is domestic violence, but I'm not 

5

sure it is any different.  And the reason that domestic 

6

violence is different is because it is different than 

7

strangeronstranger violence. 

8
9

 These are not isolated instances. 

This is a 

pattern of abusive behavior, and it may start with more 

10

slight injuries.  It may start even without any physical 

11

violence at all. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I don't understand 

13

that point.  Are you saying the first episode of 

14

domestic violence wouldn't qualify?  You keep talking 

15

about a pattern of behavior.  I assumed your argument 

16

would be the same if it is the very first incident of 

17

misdemeanor domestic violence. 

18

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

It  it certainly would 

19

be the same as long as it fit within the scope of that 

20

statute. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Why are you talking 

22

about  why are you talking about patterns of domestic 

23

violence? 

24
25

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Only to focus on what 

Congress was doing here.  Congress recognized what

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

domestic violence was and it wanted to intervene at an 

2

early stage before the violence escalated and certainly 

3

before it turned deadly, before the offender reached for 

4

a gun. 

5

 And the fatal flaw in Respondent's argument 

6

is it doesn't accomplish any of those objectives. 

7

Respondent acknowledges that Congress passed a statute, 

8

and it intended to accomplish something.  It intended to 

9

close the dangerous loophole. 

10

 It intended to take guns away from people 

11

who beat and batter their wives.  Respondent cannot 

12

explain 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I have no problem with 

14

the description of what Congress had in mind, reaching 

15

conduct that was prosecuted only as a misdemeanor.  But 

16

the  the words that Congress used has, as an element, 

17

the use of physical force. 

18

 Under the Tennessee statute, as I understand 

19

it, you don't have to have physical force.  You have to 

20

cause bodily injury to another, which could be caused by a 

21

means other than physical force. 

22

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

And our view is that it 

23

cannot be caused by a means other than physical force, 

24

if you understand the definition of physical force at 

25

common law.  At common law, physical force included not

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

only direct uses of force by the aggressor himself, but 

2

also indirect or subtle uses of force.  So things like 

3

poisoning, for example, were considered to involve the 

4

use of physical force at common law. 

5

 Respondent doesn't dispute that 

6

understanding of the common law at page 40 of their brief. 

7

Instead, what they ask this Court to do is to depart 

8

from that common law meaning with respect to the 

9

statute.  The Court normally does presume that common 

10

law terms of art bear their common law meaning, and 

11

there is no basis to depart here. 

12

 This case is quite different from Johnson in 

13

that respect.  In Johnson, the Court was defining a very 

14

different term, violent felony, and it concluded that 

15

because misdemeanor  rather because battery was a 

16

misdemeanor crime both at common law and today, that it 

17

would be a comical misfit to adopt a definition of force 

18

that was used in the context of a misdemeanor and apply 

19

it to a felony offense. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Maybe I am missing 

21

something here, but I thought Justice Ginsburg's 

22

question was not addressed to the Federal statute, but 

23

to the Tennessee statute. 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
And it's the Federal

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute that uses physical force, right?  What does the 

2

Tennessee statute say? 

3
4

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

The Tennessee statute 

talks about causing bodily injury 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Causing bodily injury. 
 but you cannot cause a 

7

bodily injury without using physical force, and that is 

8

our point.  There are different gradations of force 

9
10
11
12
13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry, you 

cannot cause bodily injury without using physical force? 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

You cannot intentionally 

cause bodily injury without using physical force. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So if the victim is 

14

at the top of the stairwell and you go "boo," and he or 

15

she falls down and is injured, is that physical force? 

16

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

It is physical force. 

17

It's not  and I am talking about intentional conduct 

18

here.  It is not physical force from the aggressor 

19

himself, but it is physical force when that individual 

20

hits the ground at the bottom of the stairs, and that is 

21

how common law understood the term. 

22

 If that were not the case, crimes like 

23

murder, for example, would not have as an element the 

24

use of physical force.  Crimes like murder, crimes like 

25

aggravated assault, that, like battery here, are defined

10

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

in terms 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You take the position that 

3

the person with the camera says, "Back up two steps," so 

4

that the other person falls over the cliff, that's 

5

physical force? 

6

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Instances where it is 

7

intentional, absolutely, because it includes not only, 

8

again, direct applications by the aggressor, but when 

9

the aggressor sets something in motion and causes 

10
11

physical force to act against the person of another. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So then it's not a 

12

limiting term at all.  Anytime anything happens, you 

13

would say there is physical force involved. 

14

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

If there is bodily 

15

injury.  And that's key here, the Tennessee statute 

16

requires there to be bodily injury.  Respondent here was 

17

convicted 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So if I did the same 

19

thing to two different people and one is injured and the 

20

other isn't, I am using physical force one time but not 

21

the other time? 

22

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

You are using physical 

23

force one time and not the other time because there is 

24

the actual physical force being applied against the 

25

person of another, and contrary 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4
5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Where is the actual 

physical force being applied? 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

When the person is 

injured, when the person hits the ground. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay.  So if they 

6

bump against the wall and that injures somebody but 

7

doesn't injure another person, it's use of physical 

8

force in one case but not the other? 

9

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I take that back, I 

10

didn't realize they both hit the wall.  If they both hit 

11

the wall, yes, that involves the use of physical force, 

12

but 

13
14
15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But only one was 

injured. 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

And then they wouldn't be 

16

covered by the Tennessee statute.  The Tennessee statute 

17

requires the intentional causation of bodily injury. 

18

And if I could go back to the murder example, I think 

19

that reveals why a contrary interpretation doesn't work 

20

here.  Crimes like murder are defined in terms of 

21

results. It's an intentional killing, it doesn't matter how 

22

that killing occurred. 

23

 And under Respondent's view, murder, the 

24

quintessential violent crime, would not have as an 

25

element the use of physical force.  Now, Respondent

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doesn't dispute that.  He says it doesn't matter, 

2

because murder is a felony and felons can't have guns 

3

anyway. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry.  I  I'm 

5

having trouble grasping the concept.  If somebody is 

6

lying down and somebody goes behind them and says boo 

7

and they have a heart attack and die, is that physical 

8

force? 

9

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I  I think that's 

10

that may be a bit different.  The way the common law 

11

and we're going back to the common law on this.  The way 

12

the common law described it is it included direct force. 

13

It included indirect force.  It included any time that 

14

the aggressor intentionally set something in motion that 

15

caused force to be used; in other words, directed 

16

something to act according to the  the individual's 

17

will. 

18

 And so at common law, for example, it would 

19

not distinguish between a husband who hits his wife, a 

20

husband who whips his wife with a belt, a husband who 

21

poisons his wife, whether he shoots at his wife with a 

22

gun or whether he lures her into the middle of the 

23

street so she's  so that she's hit by an oncoming bus. 

24

At common law, all of those different  all of those 

25

different examples of conduct were forms of common law

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2


battery. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But it might not 


3


include scaring the person and the person having a heart 

4

attack. 


5


 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I'm not sure if the 

6

common law would include that.  And our argument here is 

7

that if it was common law battery, that it would be 

8

included within the scope of this statute, because the 

9

common law defined battery as the unlawful use  or 

10

unlawful application of force and that's precisely how 

11

Congress chose to define misdemeanor crime of domestic 

12

violence. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So your position is 

14

whenever  whenever somebody is injured by reason of 

15

the intentional act of somebody else, that has been an 

16

application of violent force. 

17

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

That has been an 

18

application of violent force.  That is our position. 

19

That was the position at  at common law, although 

20

common law didn't require violent force. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

24
25

Not violent force. 
And we don't 
The statutory term is 

physical force. 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Right.  And we  we

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

obviously do not think violent force is required here, 

2

but we think whether or not violent force is required, 

3

that yes, the intentional causation of bodily injury 

4

does require the use of force. 

5

 And if I could try again to go back to the 

6

murder example.  If you look at, for example, a Federal 

7

statute, 18 USC 373(a), we cite this at page 15 of our 

8

reply brief, it is solicitation to commit a crime of 

9

violence and it uses language very similar to the 

10

language we have here in that it requires the felony 

11

that has as an element the use of physical force. 

12

 Now, we use that statute to prosecute 

13

murderforhire cases, cases in which individuals 

14

solicit the murder of Federal officials, of Federal 

15

lawyers, of Federal judges. 

16

 Under Respondent's interpretation, those 

17

offenses cannot be prosecuted under that statute because 

18

murder would not have as an element the use of physical 

19

force.  That defies common sense.  And it's not just 

20

murder.  Things like aggravated assault, aggravated 

21

battery causing serious bodily injury would not count 

22

under Respondent's view under a variety of different 

23

statutes, including the Armed Career Criminal Act. 

24
25

 Violent acts like  against a person like 
murder, like aggravated assault, are precisely what

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress intended to cover under the  as an element 

2

clause in a variety of different statutes, including the 

3

Armed Career Criminal Act. 

4

 In coming back to this particular statute, 

5

922(g)(9) again was intended to accomplish something, 

6

and Respondent's interpretation would read all meaning 

7

out of its statute.  It would be inoperative nationwide. 

8
9

 Respondent does not dispute that. 

He comes 

up with perhaps 6 States that may have assault and 

10

battery laws that may be covered under his definition. 

11

On further inspection, most of them are not covered 

12

under his definition.  But even accepting that a few 

13

States remain, Congress did not pass this statute to 

14

ensure that domestic abusers are disarmed in Idaho, in 

15

New Mexico, in Utah and those that happen to strangle 

16

their wives in Iowa. 

17

 Congress was trying to solve a nationwide 

18

problem, a serious problem.  As the Court recognized in 

19

Hayes, domestic strife and guns are deadly nationwide, 

20

and Congress wanted to solve that problem with a 

21

nationwide solution. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Wait.  Domestic strife?  I 

23

mean, my goodness.  All we have to find is domestic

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

10

12

That  that is not what 

Okay. 
The quintessential 

domestic violence 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't know why you have 

14

to tie this to domestic  domestic violence.  Why do 

15

you  it's no different from physical abuse of anybody 

16

else. 

17

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

In this statute, Congress 

18

was focused specifically on people who harm their family 

19

members, the very people that they're supposed to 

20

protect.  And the problem that Congress was trying to 

21

solve is because these were family members, these 

22

individuals were often not prosecuted as felons, they 

23

were prosecuted and convicted of misdemeanors offenses; 

24

and that is why they were able to get a gun. 

25

 When Congress passed this statute, it sought

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to close that loophole.  It was well accepted that 

2

assault and battery offenses are the types of offenses 

3

that domestic abusers are most often convicted of. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And one of Respondent's 

5

arguments is that Congress may have enacted this on the 

6

assumption that we were not going to go off with this 

7

modified categorical approach that we have created.  Is 

8

that correct? 

9

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I don't think it can be, 

10

because I think the Court has adopted both the 

11

categorical approach and its modified categorical 

12

variant, largely at least starting in Taylor, as a means 

13

of statutory interpretation.  And so it seems odd to me 

14

to say that the enacting Congress would have been 

15

surprised when a court actually interprets the statute 

16

according to Congress's intent.  It chose element 

17

language in the statute. 

18

 And Respondent certainly does not argue that 

19

courts should be plying  applying a factbased 

20

approach.  That's not what this Court said in Hayes. 

21

And so if you think Congress didn't enact a factbased 

22

approach, it seems a little bit odd to say that Congress 

23

may have thought that is actually what it did in this 

24

case.  And Respondents do not dispute that the modified 

25

categorical approach wouldn't mitigate any of the

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

practical harms here. 
 Respondent's argument is not specific to 

3

offensive touching statutes and includes the statute we

have here, which is a bodily injury statute.  If you 

5

look at the laws of all  nearly all 50 States, it's 

6

one of the two variants.  It's either offensive touching 

7

or bodily injury, and in most cases both.  And 

8

Respondent's 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I ask you about that Ms. 

10

Sherry?  If  I mean, suppose we accepted your argument 

11

as to bodily injury, but offensive touching just went 

12

too far.  What happens?  How are the laws of the 50 

13

States constructed?  Are we going to have  are you 

14

going to have, a terrible difficulty prosecuting real 

15

you know, punchinthenose kinds of incidents of 

16

physical violence, because there are indivisible 

17

statutes that apply to both? 

18

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

We are you're going to 

19

have real difficulty prosecuting in about 28 States and 

20

the District of Columbia.  28 States and the District of 

21

Columbia define their assault and battery laws with 

22

reference to common law battery. 

23

 And in those States, there will  the first 

24

question will be whether or not the statutes are 

25

divisible.  Some of them are codified in the statute;

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

some are still common law crimes that are defined by the 

2

courts in those States.  So 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, presumably, if they're 

4

divisible, you don't have a problem.  The only time 

5

you're going to have a problem  and, again, I'm 

6

assuming that the Court will say physical touching goes 

7

too far, that that's not included under 922. 

8

 So you'll have a problem as to any State 

9

statute that indivisibly makes illegal both  both 

10

offensive touching and more violent forms of activity. 

11

How many statutes are like that? 

12

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

It  it depends on what 

13

you mean by  by divisible.  And I think that's going 

14

to depend in part on  on case law in those States as 

15

to whether they treat them as separate crimes, in other 

16

words, separate elements, or whether they treat them of 

17

different  different means of 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, how many  how many 

include?  Just how many include mere touching as 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

28 States and the 

21

District of Columbia include mere touching.  And even if 

22

the statutes were divisible, we would still have a 

23

serious problem, because in a lot of those States, the 

24

State record is not going to make it clear the basis for 

25

the conviction.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 That was true in Johnson. 

Florida was a 

2

statute that had different prongs, including bodily 

3

injury and offensive touching.  The reason the court in 

4

Johnson focused on offensive touching was because the 

5

State court record there did not make clear the basis 

6

for conviction.  It was true in Hayes with respect to 

7

the West Virginia statute. 

8
9

 And if you look at most of the court of 
appeals decisions that have dealt with this issue, it is 

10

true in many of those cases as well.  It is certainly 

11

common for States to charge the least common 

12

denominator.  Now, just because someone

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

22

Sure. 
Of the 28 States, how many 

separated out on the face of the statute as between 

19

21

Of the 28 States, if I could 

just understand this 

16

18

Well 

I believe 
 offensive touching and 

bodily injury? 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I think there's 14 that 

23

separated out on the face of the statute, and 14 that 

24

are  are common law.  Whether those  those 

25

whether those States actually separated out in terms of

21

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

the case law, I'm not entirely sure. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What do you want us to do 

3

with those 14 that don't separate it out?  And let's 

4

assume the case law doesn't  what do you want us to 

5

do?  Are they covered by this statute or not? 

6

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Well, we  yes.  We 

7

think they are  we think they are all covered by this 

8

statute, because we think that violent force is not 

9

required, which is our  our first argument in this 

10
11
12
13

case. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Just touching.  Just 

touching, is it 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Just touching is.  And 

14

we  and the reason just touching is, as this Court 

15

recognized in Johnson, is that was the common law 

16

meaning of force.  In this statute, common  Congress 

17

did track the common law and adopted the common law 

18

definition of battery. 

19

 And in a statute that's designed to protect 

20

battered women, in a statute that's dealing with 

21

domestic abusers who are routinely prosecuted under 

22

assault and battery laws, and in a statute that does 

23

track the common law definition of battery, it makes 

24

perfect sense to adopt the common law meaning. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I realize that in this

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

area we're supposed to forget anything about what we 

2

might actually know about the real world, but are there 

3

really a lot of cases in which one spouse is convicted 

4

for offensive touching of another spouse?  If I search 

5

the books, will I find these? 

6

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I think you will find 

7

cases in which that's what the statute says.  I do not 

8

think you will find

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

12
13

Where the facts 
I do not think 
 are that there is nothing 

more than an offensive touching? 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

No, I don't think you 

14

will find cases where a husband tickled his wife with a 

15

feather or tapped his wife on the shoulder for a 

16

couple 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

How does marital rape figure 

18

in this?  In a  is a marital rape considered a bodily 

19

injury, or is that actually  could that fall under the 

20

offensive touching? 

21

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I don't know the 

22

answer  I don't know the answer to that.  I don't know 

23

whether they're prosecuted under these particular 

24

statutes, or whether they would be prosecuted under rape 

25

statutes.  Either  I'm not entirely sure which it

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be, but I think it certainly is true that if you looked 

2

at the case law in terms of the facts, you're not going 

3

to find examples of someone tapping their wife on the 

4

shoulder.  You're not going to find examples of someone 

5

tickling their wife with a feather. 

6

 I mean, these are wife beaters. 

These are 

7

people who are abusing, who are battering, who are 

8

violently injuring those people that they are supposed 

9

to care for, that they're supposed to protect, that 

10
11

they're supposed to love. 
 I think it's telling that Respondent can 

12

only cite to one case in Tennessee that was prosecuted 

13

under the bodily injury assault statute, and he says 

14

that that is the one case that shows that Tennessee 

15

prosecutes nonviolent offenses. 

16

 There, the man punched his father, strangled 

17

him, swatted at, scratched at his mother, twisted his 

18

wife's arm, knocked her to the ground, all the while 

19

holding their baby in his arms.  If that is the example 

20

of the nonviolent conduct that is being prosecuted under 

21

Tennessee domestic assault, I think it proves Congress's 

22

point and it explains why Congress did not want that 

23

individual to have a gun at the ready so that he could 

24

pick it up in the middle of a domestic dispute and pull 

25

the trigger.

24

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It's strictly background 

2

information, but if you have a case of domestic violence 

3

of the aggravated sort, and there's a plea  an offer 

4

to plead guilty in the State court, as you understand 

5

it, does the State court have the obligation to say that 

6

if you plead guilty to this crime, you cannot buy a 

7

weapon?  Does the State court have the obligation to 

8

give that advice? 

9

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Not as a matter of 

10

Federal law, but if I can give two qualifications on 

11

that.  In 2005, VAWA passed an amendment that, as a 

12

condition of funding, said that States need to adopt a 

13

judicial policy to provide that notice.  So it's not as 

14

a matter of Federal law.  It's not required, but States 

15

are encouraged to do so under VAWA to adopt those 

16

those provisions.  And I believe that all 50 States have 

17

now done that. 

18

 The other thing I would point out is that 

19

when an individual goes in to purchase a weapon, he 

20

fills out a form, an ATF form, 4473.  And on that form, 

21

he has to check off whether or not he has been convicted 

22

of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.  And the 

23

form contains a definitional section, and in that 

24

section it defines a misdemeanor crime of domestic 

25

violence as a crime that has as an element the use or

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

attempted use of physical force, and then in parentheses 

2

it says, e.g., assault and battery. 

3

 And so any individual who goes to purchase a 

4

weapon  Respondent here, had he gone to purchase the 

5

weapons himself instead of having his wife do it, would 

6

have seen that form and certainly would have been on 

7

notice that his misdemeanor domestic assault offense is 

8

a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. 

9
10
11
12

 And Respondent 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But doesn't that 

assume the conclusion of the case? 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I'm not suggesting that 

13

that's how  that the Court should decide that legally, 

14

but in terms  if there is any concerns about notice, 

15

what I'm saying is that the ATF form that individuals 

16

fill out when they go to purchase a weapon specifically 

17

refers to assault and battery, and there's a good reason 

18

for that.  It's because assault and battery are the 

19

quintessential domestic violence crimes, and they're 

20

allowed 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How do we get to the common 

22

law meaning of "force"?  I mean, the statute does 

23

Federal statute doesn't say that, right?  The Federal 

24

statute says convicted of a misdemeanor crime of 

25

domestic violence, right?

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

And it  and it defines 

2

what that means.  So it defines a misdemeanor crime of 

3

domestic violence, and this is at 921(a)(33)(A).  It's 

4

on 1A of the government's brief. 

5

 And the way it defines misdemeanor crime of 

6

domestic violence is, "A misdemeanor under Federal, 

7

State, or tribal law and has as an element the use or 

8

attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use 

9

of a deadly weapon." 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Of course, that's the same 

11

language as was in Johnson, but you would be asking us 

12

to apply it differently here. 

13

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

It is very similar 

14

language to Johnson.  Certainly the use of physical 

15

force language is the same.  And yes, we would be asking 

16

for an interpret  a different interpretation here. 

17

Johnson expressly left this question open. 

18

 In Johnson, the government argued that an 

19

interpretation requiring violent force would be a real 

20

problem with respect to enforcement of 922(g)(9).  And 

21

when we said it would be a real problem there, it was 

22

with respect to the offensive touching states. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Johnson relied on a 

24

number of things, but the two were the use of felony and 

25

the use of the word "violent force," which is not what

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this statute does.  It just  it uses a common law 

2

term, the use of physical force.  That's why you are 

3

asking us to import the common law in this context. 

4

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

In Johnson, ACCA does 

5

also use "physical force."  This Court read physical 

6

force to mean violent physical force, but the reason it 

7

read that to mean violent physical force was the two 

8

reasons Your Honor mentions, the fact that it was a 

9

felony definition there, and the fact that it included 

10

the word "violent," not only standing alone, but violent 

11

defining the word "felony." 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You're asking us to use 

13

the terms in their common law sense because of the 

14

nature of this  of this provision. 

15

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Because of the nature of 

16

this provision.  Because of the term that is being 

17

defined in Johnson, the Court relied heavily on the fact 

18

that the term being defined there was "violent felony." 

19

And when it 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, of course.  In 

21

interpreting the meaning of a term in the definition, 

22

you take into account the term that that definition is 

23

defining.  And in Johnson we did that, and we always 

24

ought to do it. 

25

 And here the term that the definition which

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

uses the term "physical force" is defining is "domestic 

2

violence."  And to give "force" in that context its 

3

common law meaning, which would include the mere 

4

touching, it seems to me is  is an abuse of the 

5

principle that the defining term must be  must be 

6

interpreted in the context of the term that is being 

7

defined. 

8
9

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Your Honor, if I could 

answer quickly, and then reserve the balance of my time, 

10

I'd point out two different things.  In addition to the 

11

phrase "domestic violence," which we think does have a 

12

different connotation, it is referring to a misdemeanor 

13

crime of domestic violence, and a misdemeanor is quite 

14

distinct from a felony when you're talking about a 

15

definition that was used as misdemeanor at common law. 

16

 And the last 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It distinguishes Johnson, 

18

but it doesn't get rid of the word "violence," which 

19

is  which is what is being defined. 

20

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And I think it does 
You are saying violence is 

22

being defined as a mere touching.  I think that's a 

23

stretch. 

24
25

 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

Again, I think domestic 

violence has a different connotation, and it's also a

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fundamentally different statutory scheme.  This is not 

2

ACCA.  This is a gun prohibition.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Thank you. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 I think the central point is one which was 

10

raised by Justice Scalia's last question.  The 

11

government simply pays no attention to the language of 

12

the statute that's at issue here.  The statute is a 

13

crime of violence. 

14

 The government says that this act of 

15

violence, this crime of violence, can be committed 

16

without someone actually 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You're suggesting that 

18

you can commit a crime of violence because you have to 

19

use violent force.  You could commit it simply by using 

20

an automatic weapon that requires no force to pull the 

21

trigger.  You're suggesting poisoning isn't covered. 

22

You're suggesting that anything  that the force has to 

23

be how we defined it in Johnson, which is a given. 

24

 But when the misdemeanor  when the  when 

25

the State  when this exemption uses the words or this

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

requirement uses the word "misdemeanor domestic 

2

violence," why should we stray from the common law 

3

there? 

4

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, there are a couple of 

5

things there, and let me try to unpack it.  First of 

6

all, there are two separate textual problems with the 

7

government's approach here.  One is it is ignoring the 

8

ordinary meaning of the word "violent" and "force." 

9

 Second is it's ignoring the ordinary meaning 

10

of the word "use," and when you raise the question of 

11

poisoning someone, the government suggests that if 

12

someone is  if poison is sprinkled on their food, you 

13

have used force because at the molecular level, the 

14

poison is going to 

15
16
17
18
19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It certainly causes 

injury. 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

There's no question it causes 

injury.  But 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Pushing someone lightly 

20

over a cliff causes a lot of injury.  Do you seriously 

21

think that Congress didn't intend to include that common 

22

law meaning of the use of force in their definition of a 

23

misdemeanor for domestic violence? 

24
25

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, again, let me focus 

on  there are two separate arguments.  The question of

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether use of force  whether force was used in the 

2

ordinary sense is a separate question.  The question of 

3

whether or not physical force, violent physical force, 

4

has a ordinary meaning and whether  as opposed to  to 

5

the common law meaning of battery is a separate 

6

question. 

7

 Focusing on that first, clearly, we think 

8

Congress intended to adopt in this statute the same 

9

definition of physical force and of violent force as it 

10

did in the Armed Career Criminal Act, which is before 

11

this court in Johnson, because it used almost exactly 

12

the same language. 

13

 Something that the government really doesn't 

14

talk about at all is that the language in this statute 

15

is based directly on the language used in ACCA and the 

16

language previous to that, which is used in 18 USC 

17

Section 16, the generic definition of crime of violence. 

18

Congress took that definition and it put it in the 

19

statute. 

20

 It modified it in one respect, in a way 

21

which I think is quite helpful to us.  It  it  it 

22

narrowed the category of crimes that are covered here. 

23

Under the  the ACCA definition, it  a violent felony 

24

is a crime that involves the use, attempted use, or 

25

threatened use of physical force.  Our statute says the

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

use, attempted use of physical force or a threatened use 

2

of 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Excuse me.  If you look at 

4

the history of it, it's certainly true that Congress did 

5

intend to get misdemeanor domestic felonies.  That's 

6

what they said.  And as it works out in the States, if 

7

you take the same definition in, there would be very, 

8

very few States misdemeanor of domestic violence 

9

that would be covered. 

10

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

12

Well, let me say 
I can't believe that 

Congress wanted to write a statute that did so little. 

13

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, first 
It wouldn't be the first 

15

mistake of course, right?  It wouldn't be the first 

16

mistake Congress has made. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Some people who don't read 

18

legislative history don't know that, but if you did read 

19

the legislative history, you would see that they do want 

20

to have an effect with this statute. 

21

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, I  I will agree with 

22

sort of both of those  that Congress does make 

23

mistakes.  But Congress certainly intended to accomplish 

24

something here.  Let me say 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, on your reading, what

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

would it have accomplished? 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

First of all, what Congress 

3

meant to accomplish here is  I have to take issue with 

4

my friend Ms. Sherry.  I don't think what Congress meant 

5

to accomplish here was to incorporate the common law 

6

definition of assault. 

7

 What  Congress was quite clear, if you do 

8

look at the legislative history, what they were 

9

concerned about was that people who engaged in violent 

10

conduct, and every member of Congress who spoke to this 

11

talk about stopping violent people from getting 

12

getting guns, people who were wife beaters, who are batterers, 

13

and 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I agree with you.  I agree 

15

with you on the tough  what they were thinking.  But 

16

now what I want to know, and you've read all these 

17

briefs and  and you've actually done a lot of work on 

18

this. 

19

 So  so if you adopt your definition  you 

20

know, making them parallel, how many State domestic 

21

violent misdemeanor statutes, in how many States would 

22

this cover it, in your opinion. 

23
24
25

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, if I can, let me finish 

my answer to your  to your prior question. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Please.

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

It's exactly what Congress 

2

had in mind here, and I think we do agree with the 

3

government on this, that Congress perceived a loophole 

4

in the law at the time because the firearm restriction 

5

at the time applied only to felons and people who 

6

engaged in violent conduct, as Senator Lautenberg, the 

7

principal sponsor said, that because of the outdated 

8

thinking by prosecutors, people who engaged in violent 

9

conduct that would be prosecuted against as a felony, if 

10

committed against somebody else, was prosecuted as a 

11

misdemeanor because a family member was the victim. 

12

 And so Congress wanted to close that 

13

loophole by saying people who engage in this kind of 

14

violence against a family member could not escape.  And 

15

so violent misdemeanors were directed  were defined 

16

here.  And  and as Senator Wellstone very graphically 

17

put it, if you beat your neighbor's wife or batter your 

18

neighbor's wife, that's a felony.  If you beat or 

19

battery your wife or your child, that's a misdemeanor, 

20

and we have to get past that. 

21

 So that's what they were trying to do. 

They 

22

were not trying to broaden the category of conduct that 

23

was made criminal.  They were trying to say that if you 

24

engaged in violent conduct that would be  would be 

25

treated as a felony if committed against somebody else,

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you don't get off the hook because you did it against a 

2

family member. 

3

 As to which statutes are affected by 

4

which State statutes remain as predicates, I think it's 

5

not entirely clear.  The government focuses in its 

6

statutory appendices on the generic definitions of 

7

assault. 

8
9

 I think even as to some of those, under a 
modified categorical approach some of them would 

10

would satisfy the statutory standard.  And for 

11

example 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Even if they wouldn't, once 

13

again, Congress may have miscalculated.  It may have 

14

thought that this language, which it  which intended, 

15

as you have described, would cover a lot of State 

16

statutes. 

17

 And as it turns out, it didn't. 

And that 

18

wouldn't be the first congressional statute that didn't 

19

achieve what it thought it was going to achieve, right. 

20

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

That  that is absolutely 

21

right and even if that were the 

22

case  and I'll get back to you specifically, Justice 

23

Breyer, but if  but if that were the case, the answer 

24

cannot be that  that we solve this problem by 

25

extending Federal criminal penalties to people who lie

36

Alderson Reporting Company

1

outside the plain terms of the statute that Congress 

2

enacted and who engaged in conduct 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So in your view, and I 

4

think you said this in your brief, but what constitutes 

5

violent conduct?  So you said not scratching, not 

6

bruising, not slapping. 

7

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, it  I wouldn't 

8

categorically say that those things do not qualify. 

9

What I would say, in Johnson, this Court did not define 

10
11

specifically what violent force means. 
 And the Court did say that the same language 

12

that appears in this statute was construed in Johnson 

13

and the court there said it required violent force, 

14

substantial force, as to what 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Rothfeld, I thought that 

16

what Johnson said, it defined physical force as force 

17

capable of causing physical pain or injury to another 

18

person.  It didn't say anything about serious pain or 

19

grievous injury.  It just said force capable of causing 

20

physical pain or injury to another person.  That's what 

21

Johnson said.  Why would we adopt a different approach? 

22

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, I think Johnson had no 

23

occasion to  to specify what level of force was 

24

necessary, what level of pain.  Johnson 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No.  I mean, it specified it

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is not involving any level, that  that there was no 

2

inquiry into level.  It's force capable of causing 

3

physical pain or injury to another person. 

4

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

6
7

But 
That's the clear standard in 

the holding. 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I guess I would have to 

8

respectfully suggest that the way I read Johnson is 

9

to  is to say that it was enough for the Court to 

10

decide that case to say that offensive touching, that 

11

mere touching was not enough, that something more than 

12

that is required. 

13

 And violent force, substantial force is 

14

required, and force requiring  having the effect of 

15

some level of pain and injury satisfies that.  I don't 

16

think the Court focused specifically on what level, if 

17

any level were required. 

18

 And what Johnson did focus on was the 

19

meaning of the word "violence."  The Court italicized 

20

violence as it appeared.  And if we look at the dictionary, violence is 

21

an extreme use of force, especially severe, especially 

22

powerful use of force.  And it seems to me that if you 

23

get soap in someone's eyes that stings, that causes 

24

pain, I don't think anybody would say in the ordinary 

25

meaning of the term "violence," that's violent force.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. Rothfeld, you 

still owe Justice Breyer an answer. 

3

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

4

 I think there are several categories of 

5

statutes we can look at.  One is  is the generic 

6

assault statute that  that the government focuses on. 

7

Some of those  and look at the Tennessee statute at 

8

issue here, for example.  The Tennessee statute makes 

9

causing bodily injury a violation. 

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

 It defines bodily injury to include a number 

11

of specific types of harms, which are listed 

12

disjunctively; among them, for example, burning, causing 

13

disfigurement.  It's things like that seem to me would 

14

be violent and if properly charged in an indictment 

15

under a modified categorical approach, I think would be 

16

sufficient to 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's true, and that's 

18

what I was trying to get at because it seems to me that 

19

some of the  quite a few, actually, of the statutes 

20

that they cite have different categories and some of the 

21

categories would escape being covered by offensive 

22

touching and others wouldn't.  So I thought you might 

23

on that assumption, if you win this case, then how many 

24

States would be  how many States would have written 

25

their statutes so generally that it wouldn't fall within

39

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I can't give you a precise

7

of 

8

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You've thought about this 

10

question, so you must have some rough idea.  You could 

11

put a range on it. 

12

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I think at least some dozens 

13

of States that have use of force, that have causing 

14

bodily injury, defined bodily injury to include a list of things 

15

that one can do 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Yes. 
 and some of those things 

18

are going to be necessarily violent things, and so in 

19

all of those cases, if the injury is inflicted in that 

20

respect and it's properly charged, it 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can you give me an 

22

example of that?  I mean, I think most statutes I know 

23

just say causing physical injury. 

24
25

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, the Tennessee statute, 

which is at issue here says "causing bodily injury" and

40

Alderson Reporting Company

 defines separately "bodily injury," and this appears 

2

 in

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

 MR. ROTHFELD:

7

So he was convicted of 

He was convicted of causing 

 bodily injury, but there was no specific indication. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So we sort of have two 

8

 extreme positions here.  The government is arguing that 

9

 the statute covers mere touching.  That's one extreme. 

10

 And you're arguing that the statute doesn't cover all 

11

 bodily injury, but only what, severe bodily injury? 

12
13
14

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

We are saying it covers 

 bodily injury which 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why isn't there something 

15

 in the middle?  It doesn't cover touching but it covers 

16

 bodily injury? 

17
18

20

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

 Court could take.  We think that 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 (Laughter.) 

22

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

24
25

Yes, but you would lose, 

 right? 

21

23

That would be an approach the 

We think that's 

 inconsistent 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Let's assume, just to help 

for a change  I mean, not for a change, you help a

41

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 lot.  But the question in my mind is, can you imagine 

2

 losing this case, hypothetically, just on a 

3

 hypothetical, and that the Court were to say, just what 

4

 Justice Scalia said, and the offensive touching does not 

5

 fall within the definition of physical force, but 

6

 touching that produces violent injury does. 

7
8
9
10
11

 Now, were we to say that, then can you give 
 me a rough answer to my numerical question? 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Several dozens of States 

 well, I think  it may well be that 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

See, what we do is where 

12

 it's  where it's separable, where it comes in two 

13

 separate clauses, then modified categorical approach 

14

 applies.  And  and that being so, the only States 

15

 where domestic violence wouldn't be included would be 

16

 those that have a crime and use general language that 

17

 you can't divide in the statute and cover both bodily 

18

 injury and offensive touching.  And are  are there 

19

 some such States?  There must be some 

20

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I  I believe there are some 

21

 States that use a common law standard, as  as 

22

 Ms. Sherry said, and  but 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Sherry said 14.  And is 

 that your view, too? 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I  I think that that's

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 right.  I don't take issue with the government's 

2

 categorization in their appendix of the statutes.  I do 

3

 take issue with what the individual statutes mean 

4

 in some circumstances, such as the Tennessee statute 

5

 that we're talking about here. 

6

 I guess to  to respond to Justice Scalia, 

7

 we disagree with a rule that would say that any degree 

8

 of pain or injury necessarily is violent because we 

9

 think that's simply inconsistent with the meaning of the 

10
11

 word. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It doesn't say any level 

12

 of pain.  It says any level of physical injury.  So 

13

 assume physical injury has been caused.  We can argue on 

14

 the margins of what  what qualifies as physical 

15

 injury.  But assuming somebody, like here, pled guilty 

16

 to it, we know something happened that was physical 

17

 injury.  So assume that. 

18

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, the Tennessee 

19

 statute  I have to take issue with that, Justice 

20

 Sotomayor.  The Tennessee statute says bodily injury, 

21

 but it defines bodily injury to include pain.  And so 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Soap in the eyes. 
Soap in the eyes.  You know,

And you don't think that 

6

 if  have you ever had soap in your eye, that somebody 

7

 threw the soap in to cause you pain intentionally?  That

 wouldn't be physical injury to you?

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

 bodily injury within the meaning of the statute. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA:

How about soap in the 

 mouth?  I've had that. 

13

15

I think that that would be 

I'll leave that one alone, 

 Justice Scalia. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Rothfeld, how serious do 

17

 you think the injury has to be?  What  what counts as 

18

 serious enough injury? 

19

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I  I would  serious 

20

 injury is a  a recognized standard in the law. 

21

 Aggravated battery statutes, many of which are felonies 

22

 but not some of which are misdemeanors, use that 

23

 standard. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

When I asked you the 

 question, you  you were hesitant about scratching,

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 bruising, slapping. 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I would  I would  my own 

3

 view is that a slap in the face, which was something 

4

 that the Court in Johnson used as an example, would be 

5

 violent. 

6

 The difficulty is that because there is no 

7

 statutory  State statutory standard saying what has to 

8

 be found, so long as the we have sort of a  pain in a 

9

 generic sense was caused, it could be the pinch, it 

10

 could be the soap in the eyes, it could be the stubbed 

11

 toe or the paper cut that the Sixth Circuit described. 

12

 We simply don't know. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, none of those things 

14

 would be done intentionally, so they  they don't scare 

15

 me.  But  but I do think of a  you know, a parent 

16

 washing out a child's mouth with soap for  for 

17

 improper speech or a  a mother pinching a child 

18

 in  you know, to bring the child under control in 

19

 public. 

20

 And that inflicts pain. 

It inflicts injury. 

21

 And I worry about that being covered by  by this 

22

 Federal statute. 

23

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

There is no question that 

24

 those would be covered under the terms of the test that 

25

 the government is adding.

45

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, how  now, just 

2

 drawing on your criminal justice experience, say whether 

3

 my sentence I'm about to utter is true or false.  That's 

4

 what I'd like to know. 

5

 The  the many statutes, which include in 

6

 the same section, the physical injury and the offensive 

7

 touching, such as Arizona, you intentionally or 

8

 knowingly cause physical injury or knowingly touching 

9

 another person with intent to injure, insult, et cetera. 

10

 What we will find when we look back at the 

11

 record of the prior convictions, it will say charge 

12

 Arizona revised statute 131203(a), pled guilty.  And 

13

 we'll have no idea which it was.  And  and that is a 

14

 general problem with this area.  We'll have no idea. 

15

 Now, is that generally true what I've just 

16
17

 said, or false? 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I think it is generally true. 

18

 Not always true, but generally true.  But that is a 

19

 is a  to the extent that is a problem, it's a 

20

 problem 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Then I don't see  I think 

22

 it is generally true, too, and I can't work this out.  I 

23

 mean, we'll work it out, I'm sure.  But look, on the 

24

 on the one hand, if you just can't know, as is often 

25

 true, then on the one hand, you're not really picking up

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 serious domestic violence.  You see where there was 

2

 serious domestic violence. 

3

 And  and although it was under a general 

4

 charge and so the person has a gun.  Even did he really 

5

 beat the spouse up and so forth.  Or on the other hand, 

6

 you pick up the offensive touching, too. 

7

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

10
11

Well, it's 
So what do we do? 
It is a consequence  the 

 problem you identified of the categorical 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, yes.  So what is your 

12

 view after all this practice in this area?  What would 

13

 you recommend? 

14

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Our  our view is that if 

15

 the Court states as a standard what we believe the 

16

 language of the statute requires, that there be violent 

17

 force used, that people will charge crimes with 

18

 sufficient specificity in the indictments so that it 

19

 will allow for that to be picked up and qualified as a 

20

 predicate offense as appropriate. 

21

 I think the answer, as I suggested earlier 

22

 to Justice Scalia and the Chief Justice, the answer 

23

 cannot be that because we have practical problems in the 

24

 application of this in some states, that we're going to 

25

 apply significant Federal criminal penalties to people

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 who lie outside the plain terms of the statutory text 

2

 and who did things that Congress did not intend to 

3

 criminalize.  It is, I think, quite clear, and this 

4

 returns to the question that Justice Sotomayor 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But on you reading, it 

6

 seems that one thing that Congress really wanted to 

7

 cover, it didn't; that is, the  the defendant has 

8

 brutally beaten the mother of his child.  But under the 

9

 Tennessee statute, you would say that that doesn't 

10
11

 qualify as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I would say that if someone 

12

 who did that is prosecuted under a generic assault 

13

 statute that does not have as an element the use of 

14

 force and the relevance that is violent force, then 

15

 that  that is true. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So that means that on 

17

 your interpretation, we leave out the one thing that we 

18

 know Congress wanted to cover. 

19

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, I  I would take issue 

20

 with that, Your Honor.  I think that we know Congress 

21

 wanted to cover is what it said in the statutory text. 

22

 It wanted to cover violent crimes, and it wanted to 

23

 cover people who use simple force to commit these violent 

24

 crimes.  It had in mind that many people who did this 

25

 kind of thing were being prosecuted for misdemeanors.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Some of those misdemeanors  I think I, 

2

 here again, take issue with the government that both the 

3

 generic assault statutes and other kinds of both 

4

 aggravated assault statutes and specific kinds of 

5

 criminal acts that are addressed by individual statutes 

6

 could be invoked in situations like that. 

7

 And it may well be, as Justice Scalia 

8

 suggested, that when Congress enacted this statute, it 

9

 had a  it had a sense that  it certainly was aware 

10

 that people were being prosecuted by misdemeanors.  I 

11

 think it may well Congress really was not thinking 

12

 did not have a clear sense of how the language that it 

13

 used would interact with modified categorical and 

14

 categorical approaches as squared against the state 

15

 statute, how that would apply. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Would it make any 

17

 difference in your view if instead of domestic violence, 

18

 misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, the statute said 

19

 misdemeanor crime of domestic abuse? 

20

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

It  it would make quite a 

21

 difference.  The face  the fact is, I think it is 

22

 crucial to this case and something the government 

23

 ignores, that Congress used the language virtually 

24

 identical to language that it had used in prior statutes 

25

 like ACCA, adopting the language of "violence" as it had

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 done in ACCA, as it did in 18 USC Section 16 in the 

2

 definition of  the generic definition of crime of 

3

 violence. 

4

 And I  I guess this returns to a question 

5

 that Justice Sotomayor asked at the outset of Ms. 

6

 Sherry's argument.  Did Congress mean something 

7

 different when it said domestic violence?  The answer to 

8

 that is no. 

9

 The Congress used  defined a specific 

10

 crime with elements that are identical to other generic 

11

 crimes of violence to the generic crime of violent 

12

 felony, to the generic crime of violence in 18 USC 16. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But Mr. Rothfeld, this might 

14

 go back to our difference on what Johnson said.  But 

15

 you're asking us to apply a higher standard than 

16

 Johnson, which just said force capable of causing 

17

 physical pain or injury to another person without any 

18

 notion of seriousness or grievousness or whatnot. 

19

 And  you know, I  I can see an argument 

20

 that says we should apply the exact same standard as 

21

 Johnson.  I can see an argument that says actually, we 

22

 should apply a lower standard because this is 

23

 misdemeanors rather than felonies, but I guess I can't 

24

 see an argument about why we should apply a higher 

25

 standard than Johnson.

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, I  I do not suggest 

2

 that you should apply a higher standard than Johnson.  I 

3

 will say two things about that.  First, in fact, the 

4

 definition in our statute is a stricter definition.  It 

5

 covers a narrower category of crimes, as I said before, 

6

 than  than the ACCA definition does because when we 

7

 reach threats ACCA addresses  you know, any threat of 

8

 use of force, and this statute addresses only a threat 

9

 of use of a deadly weapon, a much more serious and 

10

 narrower category. 

11

 So it clear  it is clear that Congress 

12

 thought about the definition it was using here; it 

13

 didn't sort of mindlessly take the definition that 

14

 appeared in ACCA and in 18 USC Section 16 and just kind 

15

 of plop it in there. 

16

 It actually thought about it, decided that 

17

 it wanted to use that definition, and then decided that 

18

 it wanted to  type in that definition.  So I think for 

19

 those reasons the government's suggestion that we 

20

 somehow depart from what the Court said was the 

21

 definition in Johnson 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But I  really you have no 

23

 answer to Johnson, except that  that statement was 

24

 dictum.  And it was  the case did not have to define 

25

 the precise amount of injury necessary, right?

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I  I took that statement to 

2

 say that absent some infliction of pain and injury, 

3

 that's not enough.  That can't be a crime of violence 

4

 and and not going any further than that.  The Court 

5

 then did go on to say in response to other arguments by 

6

 the government that a slap in the face could be a crime 

7

 of violence.  A slap in the face I think is a painful 

8

 thing. 

9

 It is not  it's not a soap in the eyes; 

10

 it's not a stubbed toe, it's not  it's not a pinch. 

11

 So I did not take Johnson.  And of course the Court will 

12

 tell us what it meant.  But I did not take Johnson to be 

13

 meaning to define definitively a crime of violence as 

14

 being anything which causes any de minimis level of pain 

15

 or injury, which again is not consistent with the ordinary meaning of the 

16

word 

17

 of violence, which is extreme, unusual, very powerful 

18

 force. 

19

 I guess a couple of other small points. 

20

 the Court were to adopt the government's standard, 

21

 because the language that is used here is identical 

22

 in  in our statute and in ACCA, I think it would have 

23

 to be a case that whatever the Court says about the 

24

 nature of the injury that is inflicted that is 

25

 sufficient to be violent force in this statute applies 

26

 in the violent felony context as well.

52

Alderson Reporting Company

If 

Official

1

 I think it would be quite extraordinary to 

2

 think that  you know, soap in the eyes, which triggers 

3

 a  a State battery prosecution would be sufficient to 

4

 qualify as a violent felony, and  and make someone 

5

 subject to a 15year mandatory Federal prison sentence. 

6

 I mean, that is quite a remarkable outcome. 

7

 And because Congress did use exactly the 

8

 same language in  in these two statutes, that would be 

9

 the consequence of adopting the government's position 

10

 here.  That it's not that  that what they are saying 

11

 would be limited to the statute. 

12

 It's not  unless one assumes that Congress 

13

 meant radically different things, using the same 

14

 language in closely related statutes several years 

15

 apart  unless one  one takes Congress to have meant that then the 

16

consequence 

17

 of the government's reading here, kind of,  washes back into the 

18

 violent felony definition in ACCA, and the mandatory 15year 

19

 sentence.  I think that can't possibly be what Congress 

20

 had in mind. 

21

 In response to a point that Ms. Sherry made 

22

 about the Wachtel decision from the Tennessee courts 

23

 that we cite, we do not cite that as an example of 

24

 something which is not violent, not serious crime.  We 

25

 are simply citing it for the standard, the legal 

26

 standard that Tennessee courts stated for application of

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 their assault statute, and the nature of the level of 

2

 force that was necessary and the court here said pushing 

3

 somebody, scratching somebody would be sufficient to a 

4

 working crime of  that inflicts bodily injury. 

5

 It is not theoretical, I should add, that 

6

 people are prosecuted for things like this across the 

7

 country.  In our brief and the National Association of 

8

 Criminal Defense Lawyers briefs cite examples of people 

9

 who are prosecuted for nonserious conduct, clearly 

10

 nonviolent conduct.  People  for spitting , for pushing 

11

 people's hands away. 

12

 In Tennessee, I can't cite cited cases 

13

 reported cases that involve conduct of that type in a 

14

 domestic context.  I can say that people are arrested in 

15

 Tennessee with some frequency for domestic assault, in 

16

 contexts where the allegation is that they pushed, that 

17

 they spit, that they pushed somebody's arm away. 

18

 So you have to assume that some number of 

19

 these people are prosecuted and as in this case, they plead 

20

 guilty to make the case go away.  Having done that, they 

21

 are under now the government's reading subject to a 

22

 lifetime ban on ownership of firearms.  It seems to me 

23

 that that was not what Congress had in mind. 

24
25

 Congress, again if one looks at what the 
 members said as they debated this legislation, they were

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 concerned with people who engage in acts of violence, 

2

 wife beaters, with batterers who are escaping 

3

 application of the firearms limitation they manage to 

4

 plead down, their crime wasn't taken seriously.  Crimes 

5

 involving offensive touching are not what Congress had 

6

 in mind. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if you want to send 

8

 Congress back to the drawing board, what could they do? 

9

 I mean, they are stuck, because they have the laws of 

10

 the States that are framed the way the laws of the 

11

 States are. 

12

 And how are they going to  and they 

13

 can't  and if they can't, if they are stuck with this 

14

 modified categorical approach, how could they identify 

15

 those State prosecutions that fall within the parameters 

16

 that you just outlined. 

17

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well  they could modify the 

18

 modified categorical approach.  I mean that is what the 

19

 Court  as the government says. 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Other than that, what could 

 they do? 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I think they could identify 

23

 particular types of  of violence that would qualify. 

24

 And 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

How would you  how would

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 you identify those without changing the assault and 

2

 battery statutes of the  of the 50 States? 

3

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, I don't think that 

4

 Congress could  could do it by simply absorbing the 

5

 assault statutes as they are written, because they are 

6

 overbroad.  They reach well beyond what Congress has 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So all the States would have 

8

 to go back and change their statutes in order to  to 

9

 segregate the cases that within the parameters that 

10

 you 

11

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

13
14

Well, no, I 
 that you think are 

 required. 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

I think that is not so, 

15

 Justice Alito.  I think that if  if cases were charged 

16

 with sufficient specificity in the indictments, both as 

17

 I said even  even under the generic assault statutes, like 

18

 Tennessee, which lists types of injury, I think that 

19

 would be sufficient to, in a case involving conduct of 

20

 that kind, to trigger the predicate 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you remind me of 

22

 something which I  if you interpret this broadly, to 

23

 include battery, suppose you do offensive touching.  Then one 

24

 consequence is that the person cannot later carry a gun, 

25

 is that right?

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That is correct. 
Is it also the case that 

3

 there would flow ineluctably an extra year 15year 

4

 prison sentence, or not? 

5

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

7
8

No, it would not. 
No.  The only consequence 

 is that he couldn't carry a gun. 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

9

 conviction in this 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The consequence of this 

I mean, if you'd say yes, 

11

 contrary to your argument, the same words do mean 

12

 something differently in the two sentence  in the two 

13

 sections.  Physical force means one thing for this 

14

 purpose; the other for the other.  I'm not saying I 

15

 would do that.  I just say if that happened. 

16

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well 
And if that happened, and 

18

 you defined the physical force in the misdemeanor 

19

 section as much broader, would in fact there be a 

20

 consequence for anyone, other than not being able to 

21

 carry a gun?  I just want to have every possible 

22

 consequence in my mind. 

23

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

24
25

Well, I think to the extent 

 that that definition flowed back to the 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no.  It's different

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 definitions for the same word in the two 

2

 provisions.  And that's what I want to be absolutely 

3

 sure; there is no consequence other than the fact that 

4

 he would not be able to carry a gun. 

5

13

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

Well, and if he did carry a 

 gun, and 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  There would be a 

 penalty, but would it be an enhanced penalty? 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

It would be a  up to a 

 10year Federal 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It wouldn't be the extra 

 15 years you would get for violent felonies. 
 MR. ROTHFELD: 

That  that is true if the 

14

 Court said that the identical language meant different 

15

 things. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I assume that your 

17

 point is it's a trap for the unwary, that  that 

18

 someone who has not really been guilty of violent action 

19

 would not expect that he's covered by the  by the 

20

 prohibition on carrying a gun.  He is not a violent 

21

 person. 

22

 MR. ROTHFELD: 

If I may, just for very 

23

 briefly.  That  that  that  that is correct.  It 

24

 is as in this case; it is a trap for the unwary, and it 

25

 has the additional consequence of reaching well beyond

58

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 what Congress wanted to reach.  It identifies people who 

2

 it did not want to reach and it subjects them to this 

3

 penalty and this prohibition.  Thank you very much.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, 

 Mr. Rothfeld. 
 Ms. Sherry, 5 minutes. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MS. ARBUS SHERRY: 

I have four points. 

10

 Number one, Justice Breyer, you are exactly right and it 

11

 does mean something different in this statute.  Justice 

12

 Kagan, it is a lesser definition of physical force. 

13

 There is  this is a misdemeanor offense, 

14

 it's not a felony offense.  Common law misdemeanor, 

15

 understanding of physical force applies directly here. 

16

 It's a perfect fit, unlike in Johnson. 

17

 Also this is a fundamentally different 

18

 statute.  This is not ACCA; we're not talking about a 

19

 15year mandatory minimum sentence.  A consequence in 

20

 ACCA of saying it's not a violent felony means there's 

21

 no mandatory minimum, but the individual still cannot 

22

 possess a gun, and a sentence in court can still take 

23

 prior convictions into consideration.  This is a gun 

24

 prohibition that applies equally to nonviolent felons, 

25

 to drug addicts, to the mentally ill, to and other classes of

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 individuals that Congress thought could not be trusted 

2

 to possess a gun. 

3

 The second point, we're talking about 

4

 criminal convictions here.  These are events that are 

5

 serious enough to require police intervention and to 

6

 have someone prosecuted to a successful conviction.  And 

7

 so if you look through the cases, these are not examples 

8

 of husbands tapping their wives or giving them a paper 

9

 cut or stubbing their toe.  These are cases of real 

10
11

 domestic abuse. 
 And the third point is one of the fatal 

12

 flaws in Respondent's argument, he acknowledges the 

13

 legislative history.  He acknowledges that Congress was 

14

 trying to get guns away from violent individuals.  But 

15

 these violent individuals who are convicted of 

16

 misdemeanors are not convicted of misdemeanors in the 

17

 abstract. 

18

 They're actually convicted of violating 

19

 certain State laws.  And the State laws that exist, the 

20

 State laws that are on the books do not qualify as 

21

 misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence in his  under 

22

 his interpretation. 

23

 And the fourth point is I would encourage 

24

 the Court to look at the State statutes that we do cite 

25

 in the appendix.  And I would disagree, I do not think

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 they can be broken down in the way that Respondent 

2

 suggests. 

3

 Certainly, in their brief, they don't point 

4

 to any examples where any of those State statutes would 

5

 qualify under their definition, which would exclude not 

6

 only offensive touching, but would also exclude bodily 

7

 injury cases like the one at issue here. 

8

 And we're not talking about just the generic 

9

 assault and battery laws.  In Appendix C and D of our 

10

 brief, we also cite domesticspecific  domestic 

11

 violence laws, domestic assault, and domestic battery 

12

 laws. 

13

 And it is quite perverse to think that 

14

 Congress adopted a statute that was designed to take 

15

 guns away from domestic abusers and chose to define 

16

 misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in a way that not 

17

 only excludes generic assault and battery laws, but also 

18

 excludes most domestic assault and battery laws. 

19

 The practical effect here is far worse than 

20

 in Hayes.  In Hayes, it would have been a dead letter in 

21

 twothirds of the State.  Here we are talking about 

22

 virtually the entire country.  Maybe a few States 

23

 survive, but at best, that is all that survives.  The 

24

 modified categorical approach is no help here with 

25

 respect to all of those States.

61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Now, with respect to the offensive touching 

2

 issue, I just want to  I don't want to leave the Court 

3

 with the impression that we're arguing just for bodily 

4

 injury assault here.  We do not think the Johnson 

5

 definition applies here.  We think a different 

6

 definition of physical force should apply, and we think 

7

 the consequences of adopting the Johnson definition are 

8

 significant.  It's 28 States.  It's the District of 

9

 Columbia.  Maybe they're divisible; maybe they are not. 

10

 And even if they are, Justice Breyer, you're 

11

 absolutely correct that if you looked at the State court 

12

 records in this case  these cases, in most cases, it 

13

 is not going to identify the actual crime of conviction. 

14

 And so in those cases, it is going to be a 

15

 virtual dead letter, in the same way that it was in 

16

 Hayes.  In Hayes, it wasn't nationwide; onethird of the 

17

 States had domestic violence laws on the books.  So it's 

18

 similar to Hayes.  It's similar to Nijhawan.  It's 

19

 similar to what this Court said in Taylor when it 

20

 rejected the common law definition of "burglary." 

21

 And the last point is that this Court has a 

22

 choice.  It can either embrace the common law meaning of 

23

 force and ensure that people who harm those that they 

24

 are supposed to protect do not have guns, or it can 

25

 depart from the common law, which it does not normally

62

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 do, and render 922(g)(9) a virtual dead letter.
