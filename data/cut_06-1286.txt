Mr. Rubin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. RUBIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The question in this case is the meaning of

12

a statute that provides that, in arriving at a trust or

13

estate's adjusted gross income, amounts are allowable in

14

full if they are -- and I quote here from 26 U.S.C.

15

section 67(e), which you can find at the bottom of page

16

3a of the appendix to the blue brief -- "costs which are

17

paid or incurred in connection with the administration

18

of the estate or trust and which would not have been

19

incurred if the property were not held in such trust or

20

estate."

21

I'd like to make three broad points.

22

First, when one applies the judicial tools

23

of statutory interpretation, the statute can mean only

24

one thing.

25

not."

Second, "would not" does not mean "could

14

preliminary questions?

15

do with this case, just to get something straight.

16

take it that you couldn't have claimed this deduction

17

under 162 without getting into an argument that it

18

should be capitalized and that's why 212 is in the Code?

19

MR. RUBIN:

Could I ask just two

They don't necessarily have to
I

Well, 212 and 162 are really

20

sort of two sides of the same coin.

162 is for costs

21

incurred in a trade or business, and there's no -- the

22

trust isn't engaged in a trade or business any more than

23

an individual who invests for the protection of property

24

is in a trade or business.

25

text of 212 can be found in the governor's -- the

212, by contrast -- and the

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government's brief appendix at 5a -- 212 is about

2

expenditures for the preservation of property and for

3

income in that context.

4

not a 162.

5

So that's why this is a 212,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My other question is

6

background only.

7

Are 162 expenses subject to the 2 percent ceiling?

8
9

Perhaps I should ask the government.

MR. RUBIN:

My recollection is that 162 -

162 expenses are not subject to the -- they're not

10

miscellaneous itemized deductions.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, you agree

12

that as a taxpayer seeking an exception to a general

13

rule, you have the burden of proof in this case?

14

MR. RUBIN:

No, Your Honor.

We think that

15

-- well, there are really two things built into your

16

question, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

First is the question of who bears the

18

burden of proof in tax cases specifically, and as this

19

court has made clear, this was litigated below on a

20

slightly different theory.

21

changed during the pendency of the litigation.

22

below they argued that this was a common expense for

23

individuals; yet they introduced no evidence of that.

24

And under the United States v. Janis, this Court's

25

decision in that case, they can't -- the government is

The government's theory has

But in terms of exceptions and rules, we can -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We can't take -- I

4

guess it's not judicial notice, but we can't assume that

5

individual investors with several million dollars of

6

liquid assets might hire investment advisors?

7
8

MR. RUBIN:

advisors, Your Honor, but we don't think that -

9
10

They might hire investment

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do they usually hire

investment advisors?

11

MR. RUBIN:

I don't think it's clear that

12

they usually hire investment advisors, but I think the

13

important point here, in a way, is the premise of your

14

question, which is that only certain trusts with certain

15

assets, under a test that looked at what the

16

Commissioner used to argue, which is commonality or

17

customariness of a particular expense, only -- the

18

Commissioner herself now argues that, that this test is

19

unmanageable because there's difficulty in figuring out

20

what the denominator of the fraction is.

21

all people?

22

taxpayers, among taxpayers with certain assets?

24

million dollar trust?

25

do you mean by "common."

Do you mean

Would a

Then there's the question of what
You suggested "usually" or
6


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"sometimes," "might."

2

then ultimately there would have to be a trial somewhere

3

to determine whether costs like this are indeed common

4

to whatever standard was articulated.

5

is why -

6

That's not clear either.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

And I think this

I guess you'd

7

concede, wouldn't you, that you're not entitled to all

8

of the investment advice that you receive but perhaps

9

only that that is related to the trust status?

In other

10

words, if your investment advisor charges you $50,000

11

and, you know, 10,000 of it is unique to the trust, but

12

40,000 is the same sort of advice he'd give an

13

individual, you'd only be able to get the 10,000 outside

14

of the 2 percent limit?

15

MR. RUBIN:

We think, Your Honor, that all

16

trust investment fees are distinctive, that what renders

17

them distinctive and renders them fully deductible under

18

the statute is that they are incurred as a result of

19

distinctive fiduciary obligations.

20

draws a line between costs like that, that are incurred

21

as a result of distinctive fiduciary obligation, which

22

would include all investment management or advice fees,

23

and by contrast costs that inhere in ownership of a

24

particular piece of property and that any owner of that

25

property would have to pay.

describe because that's how they are caused.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But this asks about whether

Mr. Rubin, you were not

willing to agree with the Chief when he said:

special because this is a trust.

So it's not something that necessarily
inheres in the nature of the trust.

Well, it seems to me that

that just simply couldn't have been Congress's purpose

in passing this statute because now you have a recipe

for avoidance.

MR. RUBIN:

Well, Your Honor, to begin with,

5

there is no risk here of tax avoidance through creation

of a trust.

7

substantial costs involved in creating them, but, among

8

other things, the top bracket of 35 percent -

9
10

These are non-grantor trusts.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There are

Well, is that true just in

your case?

11

MR. RUBIN:

No -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Universally, there is

13

never a danger of tax avoidance?

14

the decision on the assumption that tax avoidance is

15

never a problem in the creation of a trust?

16

MR. RUBIN:

You want us to write

Well, the Commissioner concedes

17

at page 37 of her brief that there is no substantial

18

problem of income- splitting through the use of

19

non-grantor trusts; and, indeed, throughout -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that true?

And I'm

21

looking at testimony given by J. Roger Mintz in 1986

22

when this measure was before Congress, and in that

23

written testimony is the statement:

24

treatment of trusts as separate taxpayers with a

25

separate, graduated rate schedule can cause income to be
14
Alderson Reporting Company

"First, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

taxed at a rate lower than if the grantor had retained

2

direct ownership of the trust assets or given the assets

3

outright to the beneficiaries."

4

So apparently the Treasury was telling the

5

Congress that there is a problem.

6

MR. RUBIN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

That

7

problem was solved in Section 1 of 26 U.S. Code -- and

8

this is described at page 37 of our brief -- by a

9

compression of the tax brackets.

The 35 percent bracket

10

kicks in for non-grantor trusts at $10,500.

11

individual it kicks in at $349,000.

12

there is no incentive to move money into a trust in

13

order to avoid taxation at a -- at a lower rate.

As a consequence,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

term of art.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

money.

6

MR. RUBIN:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

So a "non-grantor trust" -

Yes.
A grantor trust would be

one of those pass-throughs.

9

MR. RUBIN:

Yes.

And, indeed, this, I think

10

-- and part of the answer to Justice Kennedy's question:

11

The problem of tax avoidance was dealt with in section

12

67)(c), where entities like that were -- were said to be

13

treated as pass-through entities with no independent

14

existence.

15

specifically from that because of this absence of risk

16

of income-splitting.

17

the structure of the statute, not merely its text, but

18

the structure of the statute, indicates that this is

19

what Congress intended.

20

But trusts and estates were excepted

23

MR. RUBIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think -- I

24

see your point.

And I think this is why, if you look at

25

the structure of Section 67, which treats pass-through
17
Alderson Reporting Company

entities but not trusts and estates as presenting a risk

2

of income-splitting; if you look at the Code more

3

broadly, which permits deductions by trusts and estates

in many circumstances -- section 68 does; section 154

5

does -- when they're not permitted by individuals and

6

especially when you look at the statutory history

7

here -

8
9

Both houses of Congress -- well, this was
preexisting law, I should begin by saying.

And then

10

both houses of Congress passed in the '86 Act this

JUSTICE BREYER:

I've read the legislative

13

history, which shows to me, anyway, precisely no light

whatsoever.

is say, treat trusts like individuals, except in respect

to special expenses.

into it, though I'm tempted to, but I'd like to know

MR. RUBIN:

Well, Your Honor, I guess my

response is severalfold.

doesn't ask what usually happens on the outside or

16

commonly or customarily, and indeed the Commissioner has

17

abandoned this reading of the statute precisely because

it presents the kind of imponderables that I was

7

Well,

The only difference is

Our case is much further from the line than

8

that because the investment advice must be tailored to

these, to these rules under Connecticut law.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Well, then

11

let's take that.

12

an investment advisor, doesn't tell him that he is a

trustee, just says, I need to know, I can't decide,

should I invest in Union Pacific or CSX?

upon it.

We think that this is intended

It is not merely what a

10

prudent man would do under the old Harvard College v.

11

12

Investments that individuals can and do

invest in are not open to trustees who have a series of

rules, some of which are counterintuitive, in fact,

15

about what they can do.

17

we think is investment advice and if it's properly

obtained it is distinctive.

And these are listed at pages 7

But that -- what you're describing

19

I should say also in response -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How can it be

21

distinctive if the advisor doesn't even know that the

person's a trustee?

MR. RUBIN:

He will eventually come to know

that the form is different, Your Honor, yes.

But I

10

don't think the subjective knowledge of the person from

whom one gets the advice is the question.

12

I think, is textually directed to the incurment of the

13

cost.

The question,

14

And I should say also in part of response to

15

part of Justice Breyer's question, the statutory history

16

isn't merely the legislative history.

17

that, despite having just the first prong in it when it

18

was passed by both houses of Congress, there was a floor

19

amendment in the Senate on the day that it passed the

20

Senate that dealt with pass-throughs.

21

67(c), and the changes made in the conference committee,

22

again as the Commissioner acknowledges at page 37 of her

23

brief, the changes made in conference, including the

24

addition of this, were to deal precisely with how should

25

we deal with pass-throughs and trusts, and trust

It's the fact

In the first sentence it speaks to it in respect to

JUSTICE ALITO:

But have they issued a

9

MR. RUBIN:

There's only a proposed

And we believe that because

11

their readings are not textually supportable, are

12

unadministratable and aren't what Congress intended,

13

that after applying the ordinary tools of statutory

construction, there is only one meaning that this text

can have.

I'd like to respond to -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is it not

administerable?

rendition of the statute is one thing, but this is

exactly what Justice Breyer was talking about.

the 2 percent floor for costs which would not have not

And that

This is somewhat of a

11

mystery, the wording of that clause.

it a limited reading, rather than, in your suggestion,

that this provision that up until the very end read just

give that an expansive meaning?

MR. MILLER:

Why should we

I think, regardless of the

20

timing, Your Honor, Congress chose to enact it and that

21

choice has to be given effect.

22

look at the way that the section as a whole is set up,

67(e), the first introductory clause creates the general

24

principle that for purposes of this section the adjusted

2

then there is clause one.

3

So in the context of this section, we have a

4

general rule and then an exception.

5

be interpreted in light of the usual principle that

6

exceptions, particularly ambiguous exceptions, should

7

not be construed so as to swallow up the entirety of the

8

rule, which is essentially what Petitioner's

9

interpretation would do.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that ought to

Why do you think that the

11

only instances where the expense would not have occurred

12

are those instances where it could not have occurred?

13

That doesn't strike me as self-evident.

I mean, I understand why you do it, so that

can you have a nice clear line, which I am all for.

16

the line given by your colleague is just as clear.

"would" just does not mean "could."

words.

MR. MILLER:

But

certainly different words.

We're not suggesting that

they are synonyms.

contexts in which the word "would" can carry the same

meaning that is also expressed through the word "could."

But we are suggesting that there are

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Give me a context where -

2

where -- other than this statute, where in common

3

parlance people use "would" to mean "could."

4

MR. MILLER:

Another example would be if I

5

were to say that that glass would not hold more than 8

6

ounces of water, that would mean that it could not hold

7

more than 8 ounces of water.

not happen, of course.

22

two concepts are not the same.

MR. MILLER:

But it doesn't mean that -- the

I think, when -- when you have

24

the word "would," as we have in this statute, that's not

25

qualified in any way, it's ambiguous in the sense that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

it can mean definitely would not have been incurred,

2

probably would not have been incurred, customarily,

ordinarily would not have been incurred, which is the

meaning -

MR. MILLER:

Right.

And certainly the

22

statute also admits of the reading given to it by the

23

Fourth and Federal Circuits, which is that "would not

have been incurred" means customarily or ordinarily

25

would not have been incurred by individuals.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we can rush to the

2

fallback position, is it acceptable to have a test that

3

says would the expense have been incurred if the

4

nontrust business wanted to achieve an objective that

5

the trust wanted to achieve here, fixing the roof?

6

MR. MILLER:

I -- I think that that raises

7

the question of what is the relevant comparison group

8

for -- for individuals outside of the trust side of it.

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I think the structure

of the statute requires us to -- to do that.

11

MR. MILLER:

That's right.

And -- and we

12

would suggest that the relevant comparison is

13

individuals with -- with similar assets, right, because

14

it's in the absence of a trust, not if the property did

15

not exist.

16

held those assets outright, and an individual with those

17

assets trying to achieve those goals might well seek

18

investment advice.

19

So you have to look at an individual who

Will, you give as an example

20

of something that wouldn't fall within the 2 percent

22

What is the difference between that

MR. MILLER:

5

What Is it more expensive to -

to fill out a 1041 than to fill out the 1040?
MR. MILLER:

It's more expensive because

6

it's an additional cost.

If an individual were to hold

7

the property outright, he or she would simply put the

8

income from that property on his own 1040.

9

addition there is a trust, then the trust has to fill

If in

10

out a 1041, the trust also has to prepare Form K-1s and

11

send them out both to the beneficiaries and to the IRS,

12

showing the beneficiaries' share of the trust income,

13

and then the individual still has to file a 1040.

14

the existence of the trust has created this whole

15

additional set of filing and reporting obligations.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So

Yes, but it's the

17

individual who has to file the 1040.

What the trustee

18

is filing is the 1041.

19

was going to ask the same question that Justice Alito

20

did, and that is why do you place so much significance

21

either in the label, i.e., it's fiduciary return, or in

22

the peculiar fact that it is a fiduciary who is filing

23

that return?

And -- and why do you place -- I

24

It's a tax return and -- and I think your -

25

the government's argument is that with respect to -- to
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other items that may be disputed, you should regard them

2

at a fairly general level, i.e., investment advice, not

fiduciary investment advice.

4

tax return, you don't regard it as a general -- at a

5

general level; you regard it at a very specific level,

6

i.e., a fiduciary tax return.

7

government with respect to the tax return is doing

8

exactly what it criticizes the taxpayer for doing with

9

respect to investment advice.

10

But when you come to the

It seems to me that the

And I don't understand

the distinction.

11

MR. MILLER:

With respect to the tax return,

12

it's not that it's a fiduciary tax return as opposed to

13

an individual tax return; it's that it's an extra tax

14

return that has to be filed.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's the only tax

16

return that the fiduciary has to file; isn't that

17

correct?

about advice on investing for total return.

MR. MILLER:

And -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In other words, the

4

regulation, the proposed regulation, doesn't answer this

5

case of investment advice in general as opposed to

6

advice on investing for total return.

7

MR. MILLER:

You're right that the

8

regulation in terms of the enumeration in subsection (b)

9

is silent on the question of other types of -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can you really spice up

11

advice that way?

12

what percentage of your advice was the advice that went

13

to maximizing total return and what percentage went to

14

this other thing?

15

16

individuals or financial advisors in trying to figure

17

that out.

18

it seems to me.

19

You ask the advisor, say, which -

I mean, gee, I don't want to get

That's just a crazy way to run a tax system,

MR. MILLER:

I think that's right, and

20

that's why I think that the -- despite the fact that

21

investing for total return is the only example given in

22

the list, which, again, is described as not exclusive.

23

I think the best reading of the proposed regulation is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

the total return and what percentage went to other

7

things.

8

to be able to tell you.

9

MR. MILLER:

I don't think the investment advisor is going

I think the best reading of the

10

proposed regulation, and perhaps the Service may well

11

clarify this during the rule-making process, is that all

12

advice is not unique to trusts because there's no type

13

of advice that a trustee could seek that an individual

14

could not -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They certainly weren't

16

sure about it when they drafted this regulation,

proposed regulation.

18

MR. MILLER:

Well, it is -- it's just a

19

proposal, again, and I think they picked what's perhaps

20

the most obvious.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in other categories,

they express no such limitation.

MR. MILLER:

That's right.

And there's also

a fairly extensive list of nonexclusive -- of nonunique

3

products or services, and that does not include any

4

other type of investment advice.

5

can draw the opposite inference from that list, but in

6

any event, that's something that could be clarified in

the rule-making process.

So I think what one

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So how does your

10

customary or commonly incurred test work?

11

have two trusts, one $10 million, the other 10,000.

12

think an individual with $10 million might well seek

13

investment advice, but an individual with only 10,000

14

might decide it's not worth it.

15

different application of the 2 percent rule for those

MR. MILLER:

Would you have a

I think if the test is whether

-- whether the individuals would have -- would commonly

19

ordinarily incur that cost, I think one might well look

20

at that because the comparison would be individuals with

21

similar assets, and, as Your Honor knows, there might be

22

a difference depending on the size.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How many -- how many

24

individuals do you need?

Let's say it's $3 million in

25

the trust, and we think maybe 60 percent of people would

can do just as well on their own.

MR. MILLER:

Is that customarily

I think it might well be enough

5

that -- for something that the Service could clarify

Your answer to both

questions is "might well be," and that's a fairly vague

line when it comes to taxes.

10

MR. MILLER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

you pick, I guarantee you, trusts are going to break

themselves up into mini-trusts that fall under the line.

I think the difficulty in

22

applying that test is one of the reasons why we suggest

23

that the categorical -- the more categorical approach,

24

which we think is also a permissible reading of the

25

statute, is the preferable one.

But, in either event,

No.

I was referring to

I understood the question to be if

10

the legal test turns on the factual question of what is

it, what is customary or ordinary for individuals to

12

incur, then on that fact, that would be a factual issue.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what would -- that's

14

why I made the suggestion I had earlier.

I was doubtful

about the wisdom of trying to turn this matter into a

would come to about the same thing, that expenditure

would be incurred in this instance by someone who didn't

have been likely to make this expenditure?

it into a more quasi-legal question where people -- and

come down to.

any objection to it?

4

And thereby we avoid the burden-of-proof
It comes to about the same thing.

Is there

What's the reason not to do it?

MR. MILLER:

If that is the test, then it's

5

very easy to apply to the case of investment advice,

6

because we know that the trustee's obligation is to act

7

as a reasonable and prudent individual would.

8

know that if -- to the extent that the trustee seeks

investment advice in pursuance of that obligation -

The question would be JUSTICE SCALIA:

The cost of the advice?

What percentage of the costs incurred by a trust do you

10

think the investment advice consists of?

11

seems to me the main thing a trustee ordinarily does, at

12

least if he is a trustee of just cash, is to invest it.

13

It seems to me his major expense must be getting

that.

MR. MILLER:

To take your second question

4

first, the legislative history is silent on specifically

5

what Congress's objective was in section 67(e).

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. MILLER:

The dog didn't bark.

But I think -- but I think what

8

one can infer from legislative history of the '86 Act

9

and more broadly and from the text of the statute is

10

that Congress wanted property to be treated the same,

11

regardless of whether it was held by an individual

12

outright or held by a trust.

13

incur certain costs if he held the property outright,

14

those costs shouldn't be able to escape the 2 percent

floor simply because the property is placed into a

trust.

relationship creates some new or additional costs that

18

would not have existed otherwise, then those are not

So if an individual would

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

sort of like a business.

And deductions that an

22

individual could not take if he were not in a business

23

are perfectly okay for a business.

trusts wouldn't be treated the same way.

get investment advice.

individual getting it, you wouldn't allow a deduction,

2

but a trust is different.

3

And unless Congress is clearer than this

4

statute, I -- it seems to me that no individual would

5

get trust investment advice.

6

investment advice.

7

MR. MILLER:

Only a trust can get trust

Well, individuals could get -

8

could and do get investment advice that is no different

9

in substance from the advice the trust might get.

And a

10

trustee might decide that he didn't need investment

11

advice if the trustee is financially sophisticated and

12

doesn't need an advisor.

13

To go -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if you get a

14

bill from the investor advisor, and it's $50,000 and

15

it's broken up, 30,000 is general stock picking advice,

16

and 20 percent is specialized fiduciary advice?

17

other words, they figure out what good stocks are they

18

pushing these days and they go down and say, well,

19

you're a trustee, you can't buy this you can't buy that.

20

You would -- would you agree that the $20,000 is not

21

subject to the 2 percent floor but the 30,000 is?

22

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

In

As we acknowledged in our

23

brief, if the advisor -- or another example would be if

24

the advisor imposed some extra charge on the fiduciary

25

accounts for whatever reason, that would be an expense
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that an individual going to that same advisor could not

2

incur or ordinarily would not incur.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the individual who

4

wanted to maximize income, for example, if the trustee

5

has to maximize income for some of the life

6

beneficiaries or something, an individual could seek

7

that same advice if he wanted that particular result

8

from the investment, couldn't he?

9

MR. MILLER:

That's right.

I understood the

10

question to refer to the case where the advisor charges

11

some extra fee because the client is a trust.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, I didn't understand it

13

to be that.

I thought it was going to be, you know, the

14

advisor had to figure out we need so much for the, for

15

the remainder man and so much for the life beneficiaries

and so forth.

MR. RUBIN:

Trust investment advice is

always distinct from the investment advice that's given
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

to individuals, both because of the demanding legal

2

obligations specifying certain factors that have to be

taken into account by the trustee in investing and

I resist accepting that broad

MR. RUBIN:

Well, I think, Your Honor, if

10

you look at, at our brief, at pages 7 through 10, there

11

is a discussion of the specific legal factors that are

12

codified in Connecticut law in the Uniform Prudent

13

Investor Act, which does not, as the Commissioner

14

suggested, require people to invest as a prudent

15

individual, but it's a different standard.

So, for example, safe investments,

conservative investments are not permitted any more in

many circumstances to trustees when an individual could

different service that's tailored to the trust.

5

therefore -- the Commissioner acknowledges that -- that

6

the -- that trusts are distinct.

7

the -- the analogy between, for example, fiduciary

8

income tax returns or judicial accountings and other tax

9

returns.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This,

But -- but resists

Mr. Rubin, is there a

11

subcategory of investment advisors who hold themselves

12

out to be fiduciary investment advisors?

13

MR. RUBIN:

I believe, Your Honor, there may

14

be specific fees for trust investments that are offered

15

by firms that -- that provide investment advice.

16

Whether there are specific advisors who will take only

17

fiduciary clients, I don't -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Or even those who

19

advertise themselves as specialists in fiduciary advice?

20

I never heard of them.

21

MR. RUBIN:

Maybe there are.
Well, I think that this actually

22

points out, Justice Stevens, part of the problem with

23

the Commissioner's position, which is it relies on

24

labels.

25

The Commissioner has said it's a common JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As far as a tax return,

are there accountants this specialize in trust tax

2

returns as opposed to individual or corporate returns?

3

MR. RUBIN:

Not that I know of, Your Honor.

4

My sense is that an income tax preparer will be willing

5

to prepare an income tax return for a fiduciary or an

6

individual.
