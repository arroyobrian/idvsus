CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear 


4

argument next this morning in case 11-796, 


5

Bowman v. Monsanto Company.

6

Mr. Walters.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK P. WALTERS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. WALTERS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

Patent exhaustion provides that once a

12

patented article is sold, it passes outside the

13

protection of the Patent Act, and it is available to be

14

used by the purchaser to practice the invention.

15

Now, what's the invention here?

16

invention is a bit of DNA that, when inserted into a soy

17

bean seed, makes that seed and all the plants that grow

18

from that seed resistant to the active ingredient in

19

Roundup.

20

is to plant the seed and to grow more seeds.

21

The

Now, the only way to practice that invention

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why in the world

22

would anybody spend any money to try to improve the seed

23

if as soon as they sold the first one anybody could grow

24

more and have as many of those seeds as they want?

25

MR. WALTERS:

I agree no one would do that,
3


Alderson Reporting Company

1

and I don't think that is the situation here.

2

we have, and we have explained how Respondents here can

3

protect their invention through contracts.

4

have to sell it outright.

5

agency model, but the more I think important --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

I think

They don't

They can sell it through an

That's true, that's

true in the case of any patented article, right?

8

MR. WALTERS:

Correct.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the patent system

10

is based, I think, on a recognition that contractual

11

protection is inadequate to encourage invention.

12

MR. WALTERS:

Well, part of the patent

13

policy, as well, is to protect the purchaser, and that's

14

been part of this Court's law for more than 150 years.
Under Respondent's theory, any farmer who

15
16

grows a soy bean seed is infringing the patent, but for

17

the grace of Monsanto.

18

in this country, when we have over 90 percent of the

19

acreage that is Roundup Ready.

20

theory, there is really no limit by the Exhaustion

21

Doctrine?

22

And that's -- a lot of farmers

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

last sentence.

24

is violating the patent?

25

MR. WALTERS:

So under Monsanto's

I didn't understand that

Any farmer who plants and grows soybeans

Is infringing under license by
4


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Monsanto.

2

Let's take the first -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought that their claim

3

is that he only violates the patent if he tries to grow

4

additional seeds from his first crop.

5

that the only claim here?

6

MR. WALTERS:

Right?

Isn't

The reach of Monsanto's theory

7

is that once that seed is sold, even though title has

8

passed to the farmer, and the farmer assumes all risks

9

associated with farming, that they can still control the

10

ownership of that seed, control how that seed is used.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, not that seed.

12

different seed.

13

in the ground and has grown other seed.

14

seed we are talking about.

15

was sold.

16

That seed is done.

It's

It's been planted
It's the other

It's not the very seed that

Right?
MR. WALTERS:

That's correct, Your Honor,

17

but if we don't apply -- if exhaustion is eliminated,

18

rather, for the progeny seed, then you are taking away

19

the ability of people to exchange these goods freely in

20

commerce.

21

things that are exchanged, and every grain elevator who

22

makes a sale is infringing.

23

You have essentially a servitude on these

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I think you may be

24

right in the way you characterize Monsanto's argument,

25

and I have great difficulties with characterizing it
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that way, as Justice Scalia's question indicates.

2

Monsanto can still prevail if you say that there's a

3

patent infringement, if he plants it for seed and uses

4

the seed to replant.

5

goes, but it seems to me it's one way to characterize

6

their argument and to make it sensible.

7

But

That's not as far as Monsanto

MR. WALTERS:

If you assume that there is

8

exhaustion in the seeds that are sold to the farmer --

9

let's take our particular case here.

Mr. Bowman went to

10

a grain elevator and he bought from the grain elevator

11

without restriction seeds to – and it was his purpose to

12

plant them.

13

if you assume in the first instance that there is

14

exhaustion to the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from

15

the grain elevator, you are taking away any ability for

16

him to use that seed or use the invention.

17

Now, the only way that he can make use –-

Let's take for example Claim 130, which is

18

at the supplemental appendix 19, that is a method for

19

selectively controlling weeds in a field.

20

elements; the first element is planting the crop seed

21

and it's a particular crop seed with all the particular

22

genetics that encode for resistance to Roundup, and then

23

the next step is to apply to the crop and weeds in the

24

field a sufficient amount of glyphosate herbicide.

25

It has two

Now, if you say that there is exhaustion in
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the seeds that Mr. Bowman purchased from the grain

2

elevator, but you say it doesn't apply to the progeny,

3

you are not allowing him to actually practice the

4

invention to grow more seeds.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but you are allowing

6

him to use those seeds for anything else he wants to do.

7

It has nothing to do with those seeds.

8
9

There are three generations of seeds.

Maybe

three generations of seeds is enough.

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is for this example.

12

First of you have the Monsanto, the first generation

13

they sold.

14

generation.

15

the third generation, okay?

They have children, which is the second
And those children have children, which is

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So bad joke.

So we are talking here --

18

he can do what he wants with the first generation.

19

Anything he wants.

20

Monsanto, he can make new seeds.

21

2 because they've licensed him to do it.

22

And moreover, when he buys them from
He can make generation

Here, he buys generation 2.

Now, he can do

23

what he wants with those seeds.

But I'll tell you,

24

there is a problem because the coming about of the third

25

generation is itself the infringement.

Alderson Reporting Company

So the second

into a room and had a box that he bought from a lab and

3

he put rocks in it and he said, hocus-pocus and lo and

4

behold out came the third generation of seeds, he would

5

have infringed Monsanto's patent with that third

6

generation, would he not?

7

MR. WALTERS:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

If he went

No.
No, he wouldn't have?

You

mean if he goes and finds a new way of making these

10

seeds, which happens to do with you pick some grass and

11

you intertwine it and various things like that, and lo

12

and behold you have a perfect copy of Monsanto's patented

13

seed, he hasn't made it, he hasn't infringed?

14
15

MR. WALTERS:

Why not?

Well, I guess I misunderstood

your question.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

My question is the same

17

with the grass as with the magic box.

18

problem for you here, I think, is that, infringement

19

lies in the fact that he made generation three.

20

nothing to do with generation 2.

21

coincidence.

But that is, in fact, the way he made

22

these seeds.

But he can sell, resell generation 2, he

23

can do whatever he wants with it.

24
25

I am saying the

It has

That has just a

If he sterilizes it and uses them in a
circus, he can do it.

The only thing he cannot do is he

Alderson Reporting Company

1

cannot create generation 3, just as he couldn't use

2

generation 2 seeds to rob a bank.

3

You know, there are certain things that the

4

law prohibits.

What it prohibits here is making a copy

5

of the patented invention.

6

it's generation 3 that concerns us.

7

of it.

And that is what he did.

So

And that's the end

8

Now, what is your response to that?

9

MR. WALTERS:

Justice Breyer, my response

10

is, if you applied the law that way to side making over

11

use, you are eliminating the Exhaustion Doctrine in the

12

context of -- of patented seeds.

13

can do --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

the other side has pointed out.

21

either you use it or you make it.

22

23

You can use the seed to

So use and make aren't -- it's not

MR. WALTERS:

You can use it to

Justice Ginsburg, that is the

24

point of the invention here.

If you look at claim 130

25

again, for example, you are saying he can't practice
9

Alderson Reporting Company

1

claim 130, which is certainly embodied in the seeds he

2

purchased from the grain elevator.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, suppose he -- he

4

had never bought any Monsanto seeds.

5

the grain elevator and 90-odd percent of those seeds

6

have the genetic composition.

7

and he harvested it.

8

Monsanto's patents?

9

11

So -- and he planted that

Would he be infringing on

MR. WALTERS:

No.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

He just goes to

So he never has to buy

any seed, at all, from Monsanto.

12

MR. WALTERS:

Well, in practical matters it

13

doesn't work that way because the seed that's available

14

at a grain elevator is not a very good source of seed

15

and farmers are not going to be able to eliminate the

16

need to go to Monsanto or the other seed companies every

17

year by going to the grain elevator.

18

Great evidence of that is the fact that my

19

client, every year that he planted a second crop using

20

the grain elevator seed, he bought high quality seed

21

from Pioneer.

22

elevator seed was so good, why didn't he use it for his

23

first crop?

24
25

Now, if this grain elevator -- grain

Now, when you buy

generation 2, well, there are a lot of things you can do

2

with it.

3

your family, make tofu turkeys.

4

are a lot of things you can do with it, alright.

5

You can feed it to animals, you can feed it to
I mean, you know, there

But I'll give you two that you can't do.

6

One, you can't pick up those seeds that you've just

7

bought and throw them in a child's face.

8

that because there's a law that says you can't do it.

9

You can't do

Now, there's another law that says you

10

cannot make copies of a patented invention.

11

law you have violated when you use it to make generation

12

3, just as you have violated the law against assault

13

were you to use it to commit an assault.

14

And that

Now, I think that's what the Federal Circuit

15

is trying to get at.

16

with the Exhaustion Doctrine.

17

other doctrine, perhaps, that -- that somehow you think

18

should give you the right to use something that has as a

19

basic purpose making a copy of itself.

20

should, but I don't see that.

21

And so it really has nothing to do

MR. WALTERS:

It has to do with some

Maybe you

Where is that in the law?

Your Honor, that's an

22

exception to the Exhaustion Doctrine for

23

self-replicating inventions.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. WALTERS:

Yes.

The invention here is -11


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that there?

Is that --

is that there in the Exhaustion Doctrine?

3

MR. WALTERS:

It is not there.

This -- this

4

Court has -- has not created an exception to the

5

Exhaustion Doctrine, and in fact it's explicitly said it

6

won't do that and that's an act -- and that's an

7

activity for Congress.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

The

Exhaustion Doctrine permits you to use the good that you

10

buy.

It never permits you to make another item from

11

that item you bought.

12

Justice Breyer is saying, which is you can use the seed,

13

you can plant it, but what you can't do is use its

14

progeny unless you are licensed to because its progeny

15

is a new item.

16

So that's what I think

MR. WALTERS:

This is obviously a brand-new

17

case where we're dealing with the -- the doctrine of

18

patent exhaustion in the context of self-replicating

19

technologies.

20

Federal Circuit's view, then you have no ability -- you

21

have no exhaustion at all for someone to practice the

22

invention.

23

talked about, Mr. Breyer -- or Justice Breyer, but that

24

has nothing to do with the -- or with the invention.

25

So what you have here is if you take the

Sure, you can do all the things that you

So you're taking the Exhaustion Doctrine for
12

Alderson Reporting Company

1

self-replicating inventions, you're modifying this 


2

Court's case law substantially, and that's something 


3

that ought to be done in Congress.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In fact --


Well, you just said 


5

that -- that we haven't had a case involving

6

self-replicating.

7

shaped with the idea of an article; there was an article

8

that you could use and then you use it and it's used up.

9

But we haven't applied the Exhaustion Doctrine when you

I mean, the Exhaustion Doctrine was

11

So it's -- it's not that we have law in

12

place.

13

Exhaustion Doctrine and now we have hundreds of items,

14

thousands of items, all growing from that original seed.

15

We've been dealing with an item with the

MR. WALTERS:

The Exhaustion Doctrine, the

16

policy that underlies this Court's cases is

17

fundamentally a choice about the purchaser's rights in

18

that personal property over the patentee's rights in the

19

monopoly to use that monopoly and increase its sales.

20

This Court has always chosen the purchaser's rights over

21

the patentee's rights to increase sales.

22

asking you to make the same choice here.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And we're just

Well, except to the extent,

24

as Justice Breyer suggested, except to the extent that

25

the purchase is going to use the article just to create
13

Alderson Reporting Company

1

a new one of the exact same kind.

2

that what you're suggesting is that the basic rule that

3

says that the purchaser does not get to do that should

4

have an exception for self-replicating technologies.

5

MR. WALTERS:

And it seems to me

First, we disagree that the

6

activity of basic farming could be considered making the

7

9

They do no work --

MR. WALTERS:

They absolutely --

They absolutely do work, but

Well, you only need

8

how broad this position is.

committing patent infringement if you -- any cell

14

division is patent infringement.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't matter how you
You are

That's true, but that's

16

what I thought you were going to respond.

17

were going to respond to me that my question then makes

18

it infringement when your client buys generation 1 from

19

Monsanto because they buy generation 1 from Monsanto,

20

they plant it in the ground and lo and behold up comes

21

generation 2.

was asking you, is just as much a violation.

23

I thought you

And generation 2, on the basis of what I

But I think, though I'll find out from them,

24

that the response of that is, yes, you're right, it is

25

just as much of a violation.

That's why we, Monsanto,

15

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

give the buyer a license to do it.
And so it all seems to work out.

You don't

3

need any exception.

4

5

patented item, which you cannot do without the approval

6

of the patent owner.

7

approval when you buy generation 1.

8
9
10
11

There's no exception from anything.

Therefore, Monsanto gives that

Now, it seems to me all to work out without
any need for exception.

And I'm putting to you my whole

thought so that you can respond to it.
MR. WALTERS:

Thank you, Justice Breyer.

12

What Monsanto wants to do in your scenario is they want

13

the farmer to assume all the risks of farming.

14

want -- but they still want to control and act as owners

15

of the property that is owned, no doubt, by that farmer.

16

When that farmer grows the progeny seed, that they

17

insure the risk that they're not going to have a crop in

18

the first place.

19

sell their harvest -- they get one paycheck a year, by

20

the way -- they, if they get into a wreck, that's not

21

Monsanto's problem; that's the farmer's problem.

They

If they drive to the grain dealer to

22

So what they're essentially asking for is

23

for the farmers to bear all the risks of farming, yet

24

they can sit back and control how that property is used.

25

And that's fundamentally inconsistent with how this
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

The 


1

Court has interpreted the Exhaustion Doctrine.

2

thing that's very important is this is not a license, 


3

this is an outright sale to the farmers of the first 


4

generation. 


5

And then they are -- they plant those seeds

6

because they have, under the Exhaustion Doctrine, a

7

right to use the invention, and then those progeny seeds

8

are owned outright by every farmer, and they assume all

9

risk of loss.

10

So if -- if -- Monsanto wants to

control --

15

16

ownership has anything to do with it.

MR. WALTERS:

They may -- the seeds are owned by the

But when he uses them to grow more seeds, he's
So I don't think that the

It's the servitude on the

18

title.

And those things get sold to the grain

19

elevators, and now every time the grain elevator makes a

20

sale, it's technically infringing.

21

something that our law has never allowed for centuries.

22

And one of the main problems is that you have farmers,

23

their main livelihood here is to sell the seeds that

24

they grow.

25

they don't have the ability to sell the property that

And -- and that's

Now, if they don't have clear title and if

17

they -- that they grow, then that impinges upon their

2

ability to make a living.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I have only one question

4

so far, it's a farming question.

5

you are going to make seeds, you leave the crop in

longer.

7

the north 40 and the south 40, the north 40, he's going

8

to plants soybeans to be used for flour, human

9

consumption, and south 40, he wants seeds.

10

With some crops if

In -- what about soybeans?

If the farmer has

Does he

leave the plants in the ground the same amount of time?

11

MR. WALTERS:

You know, most farmers are not

12

growing soybeans for -- for seed.

13

types of --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. WALTERS:

There are various

You would not?

Okay.

-- various types of farmers

16

who are -- who are growing foundation seed, for example,

17

that is very close to the -- to the first generation

18

seed that's engineered.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

thought soybeans are seeds.

21

MR. WALTERS:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't understand this.

I

They are.
But that's -- if you're

23

going to use the soybeans for seeds as opposed to flour,

24

do you leave them in the ground any longer?

25

MR. WALTERS:

I don't know the answer to
18


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that question.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.
Mr. Walters, could you go

4

back to the Chief Justice's opening question because the

5

Chief Justice asked you what incentive Monsanto would

6

have to produce this kind of product if you were right.

7

And you said, well, they can protect themselves by

8

contract.

9

Actually, it seems to me that that answer is

10

peculiarly insufficient in this kind of a case because

11

all that has to happen is that one seed escapes the web

12

of these contracts, and that seed because it can

13

self-replicate in the way that it can, essentially makes

14

all the contracts worthless.

15

the Chief Justice's problem, that Monsanto would have no

16

incentive to create a product like this one.

17

MR. WALTERS:

So again, we are back to

Taking our example here

18

where -- where Petitioner bought commodity seeds, it's

19

an undifferentiated mixture, it can't be overemphasized

20

how different every single seed is, you don't know a

21

Monsanto from a Pioneer from an Asgrow.

22

the maturity rate.

23

particular maturity bean for my field because I don't

24

want it to mature before it gets high enough for the

combine to come around and cut it.

2

all these things dialed in, these different

3

variabilities.

4

you don't know what exactly it is that you want and you

Now, to answer your question, Justice Kagan,

about -- well, under our theory, if somebody does breach

contract law, they can actually do it under an agency

model, like General Electric did in the 1920s.

2

that's only fair because there, the agent growers are

assuming -- well, Monsanto was assuming the risk that

4

the farmers are.

5

And then

And there is some equitability there with

6

the -- the risk sharing between the farmers and

7

Monsanto.

8

risks associated with farming, yet they want to control

9

how they use those seeds all the way down the

10

Now they want the farmers to take all the

distribution chain.

I will reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY,

15

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

16
17
18

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I'd like to start by talking about this

19

Court's decision in J.E.M. because I think it largely

20

resolves this case.

21

issue there was whether or not you could get a utility

22

patent on a plant.

23

get a utility patent because the Plant Variety

24

Protection Act implicitly repealed the Patent Act in

25

that respect.

J.E.M. was a patent case, and the

The argument was that you couldn't

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

This Court rejected that argument, and the

2

reason it rejected that argument was because it found no

3

conflict between the two statutes.

4

no conflict between the two statutes is because it said

5

that it is harder to get a utility patent, and for that

6

reason, you get greater protections -- under the Patent

7

Act, you get greater rights of exclusion under the

8

Patent Act than you do under the PVPA.

9

The reason it found

And it said, most notably, there is no seed

10

saving exemption in the Patent Act, there is no research

11

exemption in the Patent Act.

12

Petitioner's argument would be that this Court would not

13

only be reading a seed-saving exemption into the Patent

14

Act, and a research exemption, it would be doing much,

15

much, much more under the guise of patent exhaustion.

16

The consequence of

Justice Breyer, as you pointed out, the

17

Exhaustion Doctrine really has nothing to do with this

18

case, and that's because the Exhaustion Doctrine has

19

always been limited to the particular article that was

20

sold, and we are talking about a different article here.

21

And it's never extended to the making of a new article.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I mean,

23

this -- the reason it's never is because this is an

24

entirely different case.

25

because you have the intersection of the Exhaustion

It's the reason it's here

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Doctrine and the -- the normal protection of reinvented

2

articles.

3

that we've never applied the Exhaustion Doctrine that

4

way either.

5

Doctrine to articles that reinvent themselves like plant

6

seed.

So I don't think it gets you very far to say

7

We have never applied the Reinvention

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

It's true that the Court

8

hasn't had an exhaustion case specifically involving the

9

sort of replicating technology, but when the Court has

10

talked about exhaustion it has always focused on the

11

specific article that's sold and it has done that for a

12

reason.

13

the patentholder controls that very first sale it gets

14

the one royalty with respect to the actual article sold.

The concept underlying exhaustion is that when

Petitioner's argument isn't limited to the

15
16

commodity grain that we are talking about.

17

even limited -- when you talk -- Justice Breyer, you

18

mentioned the three different generations of seeds.

19

There is actually quite a few more generations than

20

those three.

21

It's not

If the concept is the sale of a parent plant

22

exhausts the patentholder's rights, not only with

23

respect to that seed, but with respect to all the

24

progeny seed, we would have to go all the way back to

25

the very first Roundup Ready plant that was created as
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

part of the transformation event.

2

Ready seed in existence today is the progeny of that one

3

parent plant and, as Your Honor pointed out, that would

4

eviscerate patent protections.

5

incentive to invest, not just in Roundup Ready soybeans

6

or not even agricultural technology, but it's quite a

7

bit broader than that.

8
9

Every single Roundup

There would be no

In order to encourage investment, the Patent
Act provides 20 years of exclusivity.

This would be

10

reducing the 20-year term to essentially one and only

11

sale.

12

investments with that first sale and so the more likely

13

consequence is that research dollars would be put

14

elsewhere.

It would be near impossible to recoup your

15

The other --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's a pretty horrible

17

result, but let me give you another horrible result, and

18

that is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be

19

able to do a second planting by simply getting the

20

undifferentiated seeds from -- from a grain elevator

21

because at least a few of those seeds will always be

22

patented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything

23

from a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use

24

it for second plantings where the risks are so high that

25

it doesn't pay to buy expensive seed.
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Now they can't do

Official

1

that anymore because there's practically no grain

2

elevator that doesn't have at least one patented seed in

3

it.

4

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

And the answer to that is

5

this is actually not a traditional farming practice.

6

Despite what Petitioner says, farmers do not generally

7

go to grain elevators, buy commingled grain, plant it in

8

the ground as seed.

9

Association brief submitted on behalf of soybean

If you look at the American Soybean

10

farmers, it says as much.

11

which is submitted on behalf of grain elevators, it also

12

explains that.

13

If you look at the CHS brief,

And there is a number of reasons why that is

14

the case.

15

about, which is that they are an undifferentiated mix,

16

but there are other reasons as well.

17

grain elevators is not to sell commingled grain as seed.

18

If that was their business they would have to comply with

19

seed labeling laws.

20

their business model.

21
22

They’re the reasons that Petitioner talked

They do not do so because it's not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's why it's so cheap.

And that's why farmers --

23

(Laughter.)

-- and that's why farmers

want to use it, for a cheap planting.
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

2

able to use it for another reason as well.

3

take patent law and you put it entirely to the side,

4

there is still the Plant Variety Protection Act.

5
6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But farmers wouldn't be
Even if you

But correct me -- correct

me if I am wrong; I thought that is what Bowman did.

7

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

Bowman did, absolutely

8

did it in this circumstance.

9

he is not aware of other farmers who are engaging in

10

But Bowman also said that

this practice.

11

And again, there is another reason.

Putting

12

aside the labeling laws, there is the Plant Variety

13

Protection Act and, as Pioneer points out in their

14

amicus brief, it is quite likely that a large amount of

15

the commingled grain is not only protected by patent,

16

but is actually protected by a Plant Variety Protection

17

Certificate, and what Petitioner did here would infringe

18

the Plant Variety Protection Certificate.

19

putting patent law to the side, this is not an

20

economically viable source of seed for farmers,

21

regardless.

22

So even

And Petitioner's argument again isn't

23

limited to the grain elevators.

It would apply to

24

saving your own seed and planting it generation after

25

generation.
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sure, sure, I understand.

2

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

It would apply to selling

3

seeds to your neighboring farmer, and it would allow

4

seed companies to essentially compete with Monsanto upon

5

the first sale.

6

Now to the extent --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

So when -- when are

the patent rights exhausted in the seed?

9

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

The patent rights are

10

exhausted in the seed at the same time they are

11

exhausted with respect to any other product, upon an

12

authorized sale.

13

it right when you were saying that you can do what you

14

want.

15

you can do what you want with respect to the seed that

16

you've actually purchased.

17

that you paid for.

18

And so, Justice Breyer, again you had

In our view, once there is an authorized sale,

That is the tangible article

But you do need permission from the

19

patentholder in order to make a new generation of seed.

20

If -- to the extent, you know, any middle ground is

21

warranted, with all due respect, we would point to

22

Congress as the appropriate body.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This Court said --

Just so I can follow

24

your -- just so I can follow your answer, Monsanto sells

25

the seed to the farmer.

And you are saying if the
30


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

farmer grows the seed, he can sell it to anybody he

2

wants, right?

3

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5
6

If Monsanto authorizes -I'm putting aside

all the contracts and stuff.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

Right.

So if Monsanto

7

authorized that first sale and authorized the planting,

8

they would also have to authorize the sale of the second

9

generation seed because it's a new article.

10
11

And that's

exactly what happened here.
If you look at the technology agreement --

12

and it's not just because it's a contract because I

13

think it's significant to the analysis -- Monsanto, upon

14

the first sale of the bag of Roundup Ready seed,

15

authorizes the planting for one commercial crop and it

16

authorizes the farmer to sell that as a commercial crop

17

or to use it for any purpose other than replanting.

18

That is an authorized sale.

So if you take

19

that second generation seed -- "second generation" is a

20

bit of a misnomer, but if you take that seed and you

21

follow it through, all of the patent rights with respect

22

to that particular seed have been exhausted.

23

cannot take that seed without separate authorization,

24

plant it in the ground, and come up with the next

25

generation of seed.

That would be -31

patent rights haven't been exhausted then.

7

invention.

When the

You're exhausting -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

The Court hasn't had that

that case the Court recognized -- that case, it was

Let me start by answering a couple of, I

First of all, Justice Kennedy, soybeans are

13

eliminates an enzyme that makes them indigestible by

14

animals.

If they are being fed to either humans or

Justice Scalia, your question about well,

16

farmers now just can't do second plantings because

17

soybeans are put in huge grain elevators and different

18

varieties are mingled, that is true in the sense that if

19

one or more of those soybeans were protected by a

20

patent, the actual growing of the use of those patented

21

inventions without a license would be infringement,

22

although, of course, if no glyphosate were put on top of

23

it, neither the farmer nor Monsanto would ever know that

24

there was an act of infringement.

25

But more to the point, farmers -- I mean,
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the planting of second crops, that is crop rotation of

2

interspersing soybeans and winter wheat, is very, very

3

common.

4

farmers who do this every year.

5

There are hundreds of thousands of soybean

Mr. Bowman has acknowledged that so far as

6

he knows, he's the only one who's doing it this way.

7

But there are plenty of other ways in which he could

8

obtain a much less expensive crop of -- you know, a

9

particular variety of soybean, so one that will all grow

10

to the same height and germinate at the same time.

11

in fact, he explained this to the district court in his

12

response to the motion for summary judgment at page 152a

13

of the joint appendix.

14

And

He said defendant wanted a cheap source of

15

seed for his second crop beans because of the normal

16

risks in growing "wheat beans;" that is, the second crop

17

that follows the harvesting of winter wheat.

19

plant the high priced soybean seed after his wheat

crop."

And here's the very next sentence in his

response to the Court.

"Defendant" -- that is, instead

23

of purchasing conventional seeds and saving them, he

says "Defendant decided to purchase a grain dealer's

25

I think the answer is that without the

10

without the ability to limit reproduction of soybeans

11

containing this patented trait, Monsanto could not have

12

commercialized its invention, and never would have

13

produced what is, by now, the most popular agricultural

14

technology in America because, as Ms. Sherry was

15

pointing out, the sale of the very first Roundup Ready

16

soybean seed, from which all the trillions of Roundup

17

Ready soybean seeds in existence now derive, would have,

18

under Mr. Bowman's theory, fully exhausted not only

19

Monsanto's rights in that seed that was sold, but in all

progeny unto the -- however many generations

21

Justice Breyer thinks is "not too many."

22

I think it's important to understand how

this technology works.

But the point is -- and the -- the Federal Register site

for the transformation event with respect to Roundup

4

What happens then is that Monsanto uses those

5

transformed cells to grow a soybean plant.

6

And that soybean plant produces genetic --

7

produces seeds or soybeans that have the recombinant

8

Roundup Ready technology in it.

9

-- in almost all of the cases, Monsanto engages in

Monsanto then provides

10

licensed sales of those transformed seeds to hundreds of

11

different seed companies that produce different

varieties, and they make both conventional seed with a

13

of that variety.

Monsanto provides the soybeans that it has

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, there is a

6

worrisome thing on the other side, though, too.

And

7

that is that your position has the -- has the capacity

8

to make infringers out of everybody.

9

highlighted actually in this case by how successful this

And that is

10

product is and how large a percentage of the market it

11

has had.

12

So that -- you know, seeds can be blown onto

13

a farmer's farm by wind, and all of a sudden you have

14

Roundup seeds there and the person -- farmer is

15

infringing, or there's a 10-year-old who wants to do a

16

science project of creating a soybean plant, and he goes

17

to the supermarket and gets some edamame, and it turns

18

out that it's Roundup seeds.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, you know, these Roundup

21

seeds are everywhere, it seems to me.

22

90 percent of all the seeds that are around?

23

seems as though -- like pretty much everybody is an

24

infringer at this point, aren't they?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

There's, what,

Certainly not.
41


Alderson Reporting Company

So it

Let me make --

let me make three points, starting with the edamame and

2

moving up to inadvertent infringers.

3
4

Edamame is an immature form of the soybean
seed.

You can plant edamame --

5
6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'll change the

hypothetical.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. WAXMAN:

9

Okay.

If I take my -- you know, my

Girl Scout troop and have them do a science experiment,

10

it will rot, but it will not generate.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

And that --

And I thought I was being so

clever, too.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, it also reminds me that

15

my original answer to Justice Kennedy is wrong, which is

16

that edamame is taken from the pods before the -- the

17

thing becomes actually a seed that can be processed in

18

any other way.

19

Your point about the ubiquity of Roundup

20

Ready -- Roundup Ready's use is a fair one.

I mean,

21

this is probably the most rapidly adopted technological

22

advance in history.

23

soybean seed was only made in 1996.

24

by more than 90 percent of the 275,000 soybean farms in

25

the United States.

The very first Roundup Ready

And it now is grown

1

But size -- that is, success -- has never

2

been thought and can't be thought to affect the contour

3

of patent rights.

4

problem of blowing seed is not an issue for soybeans.

5

Soybeans don't -- I mean, it would take Hurricane Sandy

6

to blow a soybean into some other farmer's field.

7

soybeans, in any event, are -- you know, have perfect

8

flowers; that is, they contain both the pollen and the

9

stamen, so that they -- which is the reason that they

10
11

You may very -- with soybeans, the

And

breed -- breed true, unlike, for example, corn.
The point that there may be many farmers

12

with respect to other crops, like alfalfa, that may have

13

some inadvertent Roundup Ready alfalfa in their fields

14

may be true, although it's -- it is not well documented.

15

There would be inadvertent infringement if the farmer

16

was cultivating a patented crop, but there would be no

17

enforcement of that.

18

The farmer wouldn't know, Monsanto wouldn't

19

know, and in any event, the damages would be zero

20

because you would ask what the reasonable royalty would

21

be, and if the farmer doesn't want Roundup Ready

22

technology and isn't using Roundup Ready technology to

23

save costs and increase productivity, the -- the royalty

24

value would be zero.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, is -- I mean, that is

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an interesting question because you can imagine -- you

2

see, this is -- your answer -- this really deals with

3

all -- it could be with genetic patents, with -- with

4

hosts of things which are self-replicating.

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Mm-hmm.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And some of the

7

self-replicating items, which are infringing items, end

8

up inadvertently all over the place.

9

in the patent law that deals with that?

Is there anything
Is an

10

involuntary infringer treated the same under patent law

as a voluntary infringer?

that helps?

MR. WAXMAN:

So infringement is -- unlike

act of infringement, that is a violation of Section

12

I mean, take the --

would need a --

9

11

He's just got -- we can

-- modification in patent

law.
MR. WAXMAN:

Of course.

I mean, take the

13

example, and this goes to I think the comment made by

14

the Chief Justice, that even in the software context, we

15

haven't had this case yet.

16

in Microsoft v. AT&T that involved, you know,

17

Microsoft's golden disk that has the Windows Operating

18

System on it, which is patented, and was being exported

19

overseas for introduction into, you know, computers that

20

were manufactured overseas.

21

was a method of compressing speech, was practiced by the

22

Windows software.

23

You did have this case in --

And AT&T's patent, which

And this Court held that, although the

24

writing of the Windows Operating System into computers

25

in the United States would have infringed the patent,
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and when Microsoft did that it did infringe AT&T's

2

patent, the fact that the copies were made onto the hard

3

drives of the computer overseas meant that the act of

4

infringement occurred overseas and there was not an

5

export of -- of an infringing product for the purposes

6

of infringing overseas for purposes of Section 271(f).

7

So I think you have decided in the context

8

of software, which of course replicates even more

9

readily than soybeans do or vaccines or cell lines or

10

plasmids, that the copies that are actually made when

11

a -- a software is written onto the hard drive of a

12

computer is a different thing than the disk that was

13

sent and is infringing, if it occurs within the United

14

States.

15
16

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about -- what about

the other question --

17

MR. WAXMAN:

So the other one --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no, I want to go

19

back to a different question that was asked, which was

20

the question what do you think we should do about this

21

other aspect of the case, the licensing aspect?

22

I would have thought it doesn't concern Monsanto's

23

license of generation 1 because, insofar as it's

24

relevant, here generation 1 carries the license that is

25

just permissive.
46

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

Official

1

It is to create generation 2.

But -- but

2

they also said something in the circuit about a

3

license -- about a restriction, implied perhaps, on --

4

on the use of generation 2 by the grain elevator for

5

creating generation 3, namely you can't do that.

6

Now, they -- they thought, the circuit, that

7

there's some restriction in a license and they have a

8

doctrine that seems to say that you can restrict

9

licenses -- through licenses the use of a product after

10

it's been sold.

And that would seem contrary to the

11

First Sale Doctrine.

12

MR. WAXMAN:

13

your question this way:

14

that there's any need whatsoever for this Court -- we

15

agree with the government that there's no need for the

16

Court to address the question of conditional sales and

17

the extent to which patent law recognizes under some

18

circumstances conditional sales because in this case the

19

Federal Circuit did not address that ground which we

20

advocated and we still advocate, but instead said -- and

21

I'm reading from 14a of the petition appendix.

22

Okay.

Let me -- let me answer

First of all, we don't think

"Even if Monsanto's patent rights in the

23

commodity seeds are exhausted, such a conclusion would

24

be of no consequence because once a grower like Bowman

25

plants the commodity seeds containing Monsanto's Roundup
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Ready technology and the next generation of seed 


2

develops, the grower has created a newly infringing 


3

article." 

In other words, what the Federal Circuit 


4
5

decided, and it is entirely correct and it should be

6

affirmed on that basis, is what you're calling, I think

7

generation 3, let's say that for simplicity's sake,

8

since generation 1 is the original soybean sold by

9

Monsanto to seed companies, let's just say that the bags

10

of soybean seeds that farmers go to purchase from seed

11

dealers is called generation N and they are licensed to

12

produce generation N plus 1.

13

plus 2?

14

But then, what about N

So what the Federal Circuit held is N plus 2

15

has never been sold.

16

a sale, and because a sale is the sine qua non of patent

17

exhaustion, which is also referred to as first sale,

18

there is no exhaustion.

19

It was created, it exists without

Alternatively, the Federal Circuit said in

20

any event, even when exhaustion applies, it only

21

privileges the using or selling of the article sold; as

22

Your Honor's questions pointed out originally, it never

23

privileges the making of a new infringing product.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could -- could you prevail

in this case if we focused just on use rather than make?
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. WAXMAN:

If you're referring to

2

generation N plus 2, the answer is yes, because those

3

are newly infringing products with no exhaustion of

4

Monsanto's rights, and as a consequence farmers have no

5

authority to use, make, sell, or offer to sell without

6

Monsanto's authorization.

7

straightforward application of Section 271.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

That is a -- just a

Mr. Waxman, I want to go

back to Justice Breyer's question and reformulate it as
a different question, with I think the same answer --

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- but I just want to

13

make sure you and the government are exactly on the same

14

page.

15

Both of you are suggesting, I think -- that

16

was Ms. Sherry's last response -- that we were explicit

17

enough in Quanta and we don't have to address whatever

18

lingering confusion the Federal Circuit may have with

19

respect to conditional sales at all in this case?

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

I -You're -- you're telling

us we don't need to reach that prong and we shouldn't.

24

need to reach the prong and you shouldn't.

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is there a 


Well, I think --

-- generally in -- in 


5

clarifying some lingering confusion?

6

MR. WAXMAN:

I think that -- I think that an

7

appropriate case will come up where it will be important

8

for you to determine that.

9

which wasn't addressed by the Federal Circuit and isn't

And our third argument,

10

necessary to affirm, is that conditional sales are not

11

ipso facto unenforceable; that is, a -- in an instant --

12

everybody understands that if instead of selling

13

technology, you lease it, and you sign a license that

14

imposes conditions on that lease, you know, unless they

15

are unreasonable, conditions that are reasonably related

16

to exploitation of the invention are enforceable.

17

Bowman acknowledges that.

18

Mr.

Everyone acknowledges that.

Our single submission here is that where you

19

have a technology that cannot be leased because it will

20

consume itself in whatever use one makes of it, and

21

therefore has to be -- an article embodying the

22

invention has to be sold and where the invention cannot

23

be commercialized if it -- if the inventor has to

24

realize its full costs of development and a reasonable

25

rate of return on the first sale, the fact that there is
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this necessary sale in order to commercialize the

2

invention cannot ipso facto make all such conditions

3

unenforceable.

4

the conditional sale issue in this case, that is all we

5

think this case stands for.

6
7

And the reason I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Actually then you do

have a different position than the government does.

8
9

And that's all -- if you were to reach

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, and I think the reason, if

we take it out of the soybean area, let's look at

10

vaccines.

11

immunizes soybean plants from the herbicide in the same

12

way that a life-saving vaccine will immunize individuals

13

that receive it from some external -- it wouldn't be a

14

herbicide -- a life threat.

15

Because the Roundup Ready gene essentially

Okay.

Vaccines are live.

They have live

16

cultures; they can regenerate themselves.

17

develops the vaccine for, you know, H1 -- I shouldn't be

18

using -- an important life-saving vaccine --

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. WAXMAN:

If a company

-- it's unsupportable to say

21

that you cannot sell a quantity of that vaccine without

22

exhausting all of your rights in it.

23

I mean, when -- when Schering-Plough or

24

Bristol-Myers develops a vaccine and sells some of it to

25

14

quite on point because it's not a situation where the

15

intended use of the vaccine necessarily results in

16

regeneration of it.

17

to some lab and making more, right?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

In your hypothetical, CVS was going

it either from the manufacturer or another lab.

and State seed laws and under the Patent Variety

7

Protection Act.

8
9

So irrespective of all of this,

That's why the solution for farmers like
Monsanto -- like Mr. Bowman, is to simply buy

10

conventional seed, multiply it, you know, 20, 30, 40,

11

50, 80 times in a single generation and save 1/80th of

12

it to replant in his second crop, if he doesn't want to

13

buy Roundup Ready technology for his second crop and use

14

the glyphosate aerially.
Unless the Court has further questions, we

15
16

will submit.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK P. WALTERS

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

MR. WALTERS:

I'd like to first address the

24

statement that this is not a traditional farming

25

practice.

It may be occasional, when a farmer is in a
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

real desperate situation, or it may apply to 


2

Mr. Bowman's situation, where he wanted a very cheap 


3

source of seed for his second crop. 

But in the record at 153a, among other 


4
5

places, he discusses how he's gone to the grain elevator

6

over the years a number of times, and how other farmers

7

have gone to the grain elevator for generations.

8

ruling in favor of Monsanto here would effectively

9

eliminate that seed -JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

So a

Do you agree that it's

unlawful for grain elevators to sell it for replanting?

12

MR. WALTERS:

No.

I do not.

And what he is

13

referring to is State labeling laws that prevent grain

14

elevators from actually scooping up grain, packaging it

15

up and saying this is seed, because they all look alike

16

to -- to the eye.

17

not allowed to dupe seed purchasers, but those laws are

18

there to protect the seed purchasers.

19

And so grain elevators are certainly

Mr. Bowman bought grain without any

20

restrictions on how he could use it.

That broke no

21

laws, and it does not violate the PVPA.

22

Monsanto didn't assert a PVPA certificate.

23

has them.

24

not assert them in this case because there's no single

25

variety that Mr. Bowman planted.

I mean,
Surely it

Did not assert them in this case and could

So that's not a good

argument.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what about

3

Mr. Waxman's suggestion that we've already decided this

4

in Microsoft v. AT&T?

5

MR. WALTERS:

That case is not on point,

6

Your Honor.

That had to do with 271(f), and actually

7

came out on the side of more restrictive patent rights.

8

And this is not like software.

9

that the only way to use the invention -- now, repeat,

This is an invention

10

the only way to use the invention -- is to plant it and

11

to grow more seeds.

12

So if you don't apply the Exhaustion

13

Doctrine and allow someone to use it, you're choosing

14

patent rights over personal property rights, and that's

15

never been done in 150 years of this Court's exhaustion

16

case law.

17
18
19
20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Don't people or animals eat

them?
MR. WALTERS:

That is certainly a use, but

it's not the invention.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then why is it the

22

only way you can do is to plant them?

23

only thing you could do with it.

24

MR. WALTERS:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That isn't the

Well, that's not use of the -You can go buy them in the

5

6

There's no limit to Monsanto's -JUSTICE BREYER:

The invented product.

The

7

invented thing.

8

has a gene in it that repels some other insecticide or

9

something that they have.

10

The invented aspect of the seed is it

MR. WALTERS:

I understand that.
The same argument came up in

11

Quanta, Your Honor, with --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't use that.

I

13

don't think they used that particular -- well, go ahead.

14

You go ahead.

15

MR. WALTERS:

There were other uses for the

16

computer chips, of course, that were asserted.

17

key was that those computer chips practiced the patent.

18

And you would swallow up the Exhaustion Doctrine

19

entirely if we just could think of other uses for these

20

things that have been sold.

21

And the

The key is, does it use -- is the purchaser

22

allowed to use the invention?

And under Monsanto's

23

theory, the purchaser isn't allowed to do that.

24

that's no Exhaustion Doctrine at all --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

The people buying from

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

grain elevators are mostly people who take these

2

chips -- whatever they are, the seeds -- and they sell

3

them for making tofu, they sell them to eat, or

4

this -- there are loads of uses, aren't there?

5

MR. WALTERS:

But the only use of the

6

invention is to plant it, and that's the use that

7

Mr. Bowman makes.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but -- but that's --

nothing prevents him from planting it.

What he is

10

prevented from doing is using the -- the consequences of

11

that planting, the second generation seeds, for another

12

planting.

13

can plant and harvest and eat or sell.

14

plant, harvest, and then replant.

That's all he is prevented from doing.

MR. WALTERS:

15

He

He just can't

So -- the judgment in this

16

case was based on acres planted, and so I'm not sure how

17

many -- we talked a bit about the N plus 2 generation,

18

and we don't know in the record what the N plus 2

19

generation was, in terms of his sales or his yields.

20

That wasn't before the district court on summary

21

judgment.

22

the judgment below, which was a finding that conditional

23

sales prevented the application of the Exhaustion

24

Doctrine.

I'm sorry, I didn't

follow that answer to Justice Scalia's question.

3

MR. WALTERS:

Could you ask it again?

5

that you are preventing him from using it.

He's not

9
