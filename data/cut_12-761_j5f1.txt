 Mr. Waxman?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9

 MR. WAXMAN: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 The Lanham Act provides a remedy for 

12

businesses whose market is misappropriated by 

13

competitors that misrepresent the character of the goods 

14

they sell.  This case presents an egregious violation of 

15

the law.  CocaCola's label grossly misleads  consumers , 

16

as Coke anticipated, but Coke says that it need not 

17

answer under the Lanham Act because its label is 

18

authorized by FDA regulations.  The label is not, in 

19

fact, authorized for reasons we explain and with which 

20

the United States largely agrees, but even if it were 

21

consistent with FDA regulations that would not strip POM 

22

of its right to prove a willful Lanham Act violation. 

23

 Courts are obligated to give full effect to 

24

Congressional enactments wherever possible.  Here 

25

Congress has never precluded or conditioned enforcement

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the Lanham Act in food labeling cases, and it is 

2

entirely possible, in fact, entirely easy for Coke to 

3

comply with both statutory obligations. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If there is no private 

5

cause of action to enforce the FDA label standards, only 

6

the FDA can bring a proceeding to say that an ad 

7

violates its regulations, how does a Court below, 

8

without interpreting the regulations, go about deciding 

9

whether or not a particular ad doesn't comport with the 

10

regulations and hence would be subject to the Lanham 

11

Act? 

12

 MR. WAXMAN: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14
15
16
17

Justice 
Maybe that's a better 

question for the SG, but I'm trying to figure out 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, let me take a shot at it 

and, you know, the SG can and Ms. Sullivan can, as well. 
 There's no question under  as this Court 

18

explained in Buckman, that there is no private cause of 

19

action to enforce provisions of the FDCA.  Now, this 

20

Court in Buckman distinguished Medtronic v. Lohr, which 

21

provided and held  and did not and save from preemption a 

22

state law that was that  imposed parallel requirements, and in 

23

that instance, and this is not a case involving an 

24

attempt to enforce parallel requirements under state law 

25

or any other law.  In those circumstances, as the

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

government explains, of course a court is going to be 

2

required to ascertain what those parallel requirements 

3

are, and whether they were or  weren't complied with. 

4

 But this is a case involving a different 

5

statute.  Our submission is that it is entirely 

6

irrelevant whether or not the Coke label, in any 

7

particular, is consistent with a regulation that 

8

implements criminal prohibitions by announcing when and 

9

under what limited circumstances the FDA will forebear 

10

from exercising its criminal and regulatory penalties. 

11

Even in that instance, with respect, Your Honor, as this 

12

Court explained in Wyeth, misbranding provisions are, in 

13

fact, adjudicated by courts even under the FDCA. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And so do you concede that 

15

under the Lanham Act, plaintiff could not challenge 

16

aspects of the a food label that the FDA said is 

17

required? 

18

 MR. WAXMAN: 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

20

Well, Justice Kennedy 
I know that's not this 

case. 

21

 MR. WAXMAN: 

22

 Let me just say, not only is that not this 

23
24
25

Thank you. 

case because the FDA has never examined 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I want you to answer the 

question, though.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. WAXMAN: 

My answer to the question would 

2

be, under Wyeth, under this Court's decision in Wyeth, 

3

the FDCA and the FDA's regulations interpreting it and 

4

applying it, supply a floor and not a ceiling.  And the 

5

FDA would have no authority  if the FDA said, This 

6

label is fine and you are required to use this label, 

7

the question would be, does it have the statutory 

8

authority to essentially create an immunity from 

9

enforcement of another federal statute that protects a 

10

different purpose and a different class of victims?  The 

11

answer would be no. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Justice Kennedy's question, 

13

I think, was different.  He said, suppose that it said 

14

you are required to use this label and only this label, 

15

then you would acknowledge that there is an 

16

impossibility issue; is that right? 

17

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Yes.  Unless, as in Wyeth, 

18

there was, in fact, some possibility to change the 

19

label, but if  and I apologize if I didn't understand 

20

the question.  If the FDA said, counterfactually, we've 

21

examined this label, you are not only permitted to use 

22

it but you are required to use it, and unlike what we do 

23

with respect to pharmaceuticals, you are not allowed to 

24

make any changes.  In that instance, there would be an 

25

irreconcilable conflict and a Court would have to decide

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which of two oppositefacing canons of construction to 

2

give primacy to, but that would be impossibility. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Why isn't there a different 

4

kind of conflict here?  Let's just focus on the name, 

5

which is what the solicitor general says the FDA has 

6

considered and has specifically permitted.  They went 

7

through this very long and involved process, and they 

8

decided exactly what kind of names were permitted for 

9

this kind of product and what were not permitted, 

10

because they constituted misbranding.  And essentially 

11

the FDA has said, This is what counts as misbranding, 

12

nothing else counts as misbranding.  And now you're 

13

coming in and under a Lanham Act claim saying, no, the 

14

FDA is wrong.  This is misbranding.  That seems  why 

15

isn't that a problem? 

16

 MR. WAXMAN: 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Why isn't that a problem? 
Yeah.  That the FDA said 

18

it's not misbranding, you're saying it is misbranding. 

19

That seems a quite direct conflict as to what the FDA 

20

says versus what you are alleging under the Lanham Act. 

21

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So we know that that is not, in 

22

fact, how the FDA construes its regulation, and we know 

23

that because just by examining the FDA's own limited 

24

enforcement history, all the parties have cited the 

25

Court 

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, just hypothetically, 

2

let's say that the FDA said that this name was not 

3

misbranding, that this name was fine under their 

4

regulations, that they did not count as misbranding. 

5
6
7

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So we're challenging the label 

as a whole, which is covered by  under the 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right.  So I understand 

8

that, you would have some claims about different parts 

9

of the label.  But I'm only asking about your 

10

claiming as  your claim as to the specific thing that 

11

the FDA ruled on. 

12

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Right.  And the question is 

13

whether Congress gave any indication and it would have 

14

to, in this context where the Lanham Act is an express 

15

statutory enactment that Congress was well aware of when 

16

it enacted the Nutrition Labeling Act and, in fact, was 

17

told, not just by the industry, but by  OMB, in 

18

testimony, that the Lanham Act was being used to police 

19

misrepresentations of the character of food products, 

20

you would have to conclude that Congress intended to 

21

allow the FDA to supply, if you will, the substantive 

22

rule of decision under a different statute that uses 

23

different words and  and protects a different class of 

24

people when  and here again, I think it's an important 

25

indicator why Congress didn't mean that.  The FDA, the

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

misbranding provisions of the FDCA are prohibitions. 

2

They are not permissions.  And the rules that the FDA 

3

has promulgated announce essentially an enforcement 

4

forbearance.  They don't represent a judgment and the 

5

Federal Register provisions that we've cited that 

6

accompanied the promulgation of the juice naming 

7

regulations make this as clear as day.  They do not 

8

represent a pronouncement that for all purposes, for all 

9

statutes, the name on  the name ascribed to the 

10

product is okay.  In fact, they say although for 

11

purposes of our forbearance under our government 

12

enforcement authority, we will allow you to do one or 

13

the other  and this is 2919 and 2920 of Federal 

14

Register 58, We warn manufacturers that even compliance 

15

with this, where there is a small amount of the 

16

nonpredominant juice name has great capacity to mislead 

17

and we encourage  twice in the rulemaking, we 

18

encourage manufacturers, nonetheless, to name the juices 

19

in the product.  Under those circumstances, the notion 

20

that Congress intended this type of regulation to 

21

preclude a case in which  and these are the facts as 

22

the Court  as they come to the Court  Coke well knew 

23

and intentionally designed a label that, in fact, 

24

grossly misleads consumers to the economic disadvantage 

25

of the company that, in large part, created the market.

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And the notion that Congress wanted to allow the FDA to 

2

apply substantive rules of decision in that very 

3

different inquiry using very different language in a 

4

different statute, I think, is completely unsupported. 

5

I mean 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What would be the 

7

components of the injunctive relief that you would seek? 

8

Assuming you have a Lanham Act claim, what should Coke 

9

have done to make its product nonmisleading? 

10

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, we have in  in the 

11

course of our complaint, we didn't specify  I mean, 

12

the injunction that we would seek is ceasing to use the 

13

label as it currently exists, and of course 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Without saying what label 

would be lawful? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

That's correct.  It's just as 

17

in criminal actions under the FDCA and civil actions 

18

under parallel state laws and actions under the Lanham 

19

Act, juries aren't required or permitted to give 

20

prescriptive judgments.  All that they may  all they 

21

do is make a judgment about whether or not on balance, 

22

there is substantial evidence that to the harm of the 

23

competitor, a substantial number of consumers are 

24

misled, and if so, was it willful.  And that is no more 

25

of a problem in this particular case than it is in any

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of these cases, whether they involve food or anything 

2

else.  In Wyeth versus Levine, the plaintiff had all 

3

sorts of reasons  all sorts of different theories 

4

about what the warning label should or shouldn't say. 

5

The jury simply decided that it violated the common law 

6

of the state of Vermont to use that particular label. 

7

And the FD  I'm sorry. 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

9
10
11

Suppose the percentage were 

a lot higher.  Suppose it was 50 percent pomegranate and 
blueberry. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

It's hard to see how we 

12

would have a  it's hard to see how we would have a 

13

could possibly prevail in a Lanham Act case.  I mean, we 

14

have to come up with  we have to adduce, it's our 

15

burden, substantial evidence to show that a substantial 

16

number of competitors  of consumers are not only 

17

misled, but misled to the detriment of our product.  I 

18

don't think we could establish it.  But Coke's argument, 

19

and for that matter the government's argument, with 

20

respect to the name itself, would apply if, unlike the 

21

eyedropper's worth of pomegranate juice that's in the 

22

halfgallon bottle, there were two microns.  I mean, 

23

this  the question simply is whether a manufacturer 

24

like CocaCola can design something that it knows runs a 

25

substantial risk, quote, "from a misleading

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

perspective."  And the evidence shows that over a third 

2

of consumers who look at this label believe that 

3

pomegranate and blueberry juice, in fact, are the 

4

majority juices. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if it were the  what 

6

if it were the case that there were very small number of 

7

people who were allergic to one of these ingredients? 

8

I'm not suggesting it's true.  For all I know, it's not. 

9

But let's say there are a few people who are very 

10

allergic to pomegranate juice or blueberry juice.  And 

11

so the FDA says, if you put even an eyedropper full of 

12

that in your blend, you have to put that prominently on 

13

the bottle so that these people will not inadvertently 

14

get an allergic reaction.  Could you have a Lanham Act 

15

claim then? 

16

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, of course, pome  the 

17

only thing that consumers know is that  from the front 

18

label is that there is pomegranate  arguably 

19

pomegranate juice and blueberry juice in here.  So the 

20

question would be whether they had to disclose on the 

21

label whether there was also .01 percent strawberry 

22

juice or 99.4 percent apple and grape juice.  That's the 

23

kind of judgment that we want the FDA to make, because 

24

the purpose of the FDCA is protect public health and 

25

safety.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 What the FDA doesn't do, particularly given 

2

the criminal nature of its sanctions, is regulate or 

3

interpret, apply its forbearance authority with an eye 

4

toward, well, what kinds of things are going to so 

5

mislead consumers that they think there is going to be a 

6

substitute in the marketplace where there isn't. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what I'm saying is 

8

suppose it's the case that for 99.999 percent of the 

9

population, the more pomegranate juice, the better, you 

10

just can't drink enough of it.  The more you drink, the 

11

healthier you are.  But for this tiny percentage of the 

12

population, it could produce an allergic reaction.  And 

13

so the FDA says, you've got to put that on there even if 

14

there is just a tincture of pomegranate juice.  Could 

15

you have a Lanham Act claim on the ground for the vast 

16

majority of your potential customers, they are going to 

17

be misled, because they want pomegranate juice and they 

18

are buying this stuff that just has a little bit of it 

19

in it? 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, I think the vast 

21

presumably, and we're talking about a hypothetical 

22

regulation, presumably the FDA would promulgate a 

23

requirement that, in fact, you must name each of the 

24

each of the constituent juices in case there is an 

25

allergy.  I mean, we wouldn't have an objection  the

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argument wouldn't be that consumers are misled by that 

2

fact alone.  What's misleading consumers here is they 

3

have no way on God's green earth of telling that the 

4

total amount of blueberry and pomegranate juice in this 

5

product can be dispensed with a single eyedropper.  It 

6

amounts to a teaspoon in a half gallon.  And the FDA 

7

has  the FDA has explained in this case that it has no 

8

expertise, it has no warrant to interpret or understand 

9

or apply judgments about what kind of words and symbols 

10

and the combination thereof, to use the language of the 

11

Lanham Act, will have a tendency to misrepresent the 

12

nature or quality of the goods from the perspective of 

13

the competitor.  And that's 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you agree that if you 

15

brought this suit under state law, it would be 

16

preempted? 

17

 MR. WAXMAN: 

  We think it certainly would not 

18

be preempted under state law.  The state law provision, 

19

Justice Kennedy, is Section 110660 of the California 

20

Health and Safety Code, which  the language of which 

21

is in haec verba with the very first subsection of the 

22

misbranding statute 343(A), which declares misbranded 

23

any label which is false in particular  false and 

24

misleading in any particular.  That subsection is not 

25

even the subject  it's excluded from the limited

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

preemption provisions of the NLEA.  So it certainly 

2

wouldn't be preempted.  There might be an open question 

3

if one of the things that we were challenging in the 

4

course of that state lawsuit was the name itself, and 

5

the question then would be is this name, in fact, 

6

compliant with the FDA regulation? 

7

 Now, we've explained in our brief that there 

8

are three reasons why it is not compliant.  And the 

9

United States agrees that a remand would be appropriate 

10

in any case to determine whether it is compliant.  But 

11

generally speaking, our state law claim wouldn't be 

12

preempted at all.  Not only is it parallel to the 

13

misbranding provision, but the provision that it's 

14

parallel to is not preempted. 

15
16

 Unless the Court has further questions, I 
would like to reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY, 

20

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

21

 SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY 

22

 MS. SHERRY: 

23

please the Court: 

24
25

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 If I could start with the naming aspect of 
the case.  Justice Kagan, you are exactly right.  We

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have a circumstance here where we have two Federal 

2

statutes that cover the same subject matter that apply 

3

functionally the same standard to the same words on the 

4

same product label. 

5

 Under the FDCA, we have an authoritative 

6

interpretation of that language by the FDA.  102.33 is a 

7

regulation that was reached after extensive rulemaking 

8

proceedings over the course of 25 years.  The FDA 

9

considered the exact same question that is being raised 

10

here.  It looked to figure out what an appropriate 

11

common or  usual name was for a juice blend that had a 

12

small amount of a highly flavorful and expensive juice 

13

in order to allow consumers to know  in order to 

14

prevent consumers from being misled as to the juice 

15

content of that particular product. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What public health benefit 

17

is served by this regulation?  This is what puzzles me 

18

about it. 

19

 MS. SHERRY: 

The regulations comes under the 

20

misbranding provisions of the FDCA.  So 343 focuses on 

21

misbranding.  It has a number of subsections, one of 

22

which gives the FDA authority to establish common or 

23

usual names of products.  And the purpose of that is to 

24

have some form of standardization so that when a 

25

consumer goes to a marketplace to purchase a particular

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

product, it knows what is going to be in the product. 

2

And, in fact, that was the purpose of the very 

3

regulation at issue here, the idea being by allowing 

4

manufacturers to choose to name their juice product 

5

based on the juice that flavors the product as opposed 

6

to based on the juice that is predominant by volume, 

7

that consumers will come to understand that when a juice 

8

says pomegranate and blueberry flavored, what it means 

9

is that the juice is present as a flavor. 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Excuse me.  I'm not sure 

11

that  I mean, the argument is you can't even taste 

12

these flavors.  That's their point.  And you are taking 

13

a contrary point, that the flavor doesn't mean what you 

14

taste, flavor means something else. 

15

 MS. SHERRY: 

No, no.  The point is  and I 

16

think the argument that Petitioner is making has to do 

17

with the particular facts of this case.  The argument is 

18

because there is only 0.3 percent of pomegranate juice, 

19

that it is not actually enough to flavor the beverage. 

20

And that's a factual question that could be resolved on 

21

remand.  But Petitioner's argument with respect to the 

22

name would be exactly the same, Justice Alito, if there 

23

 was 10 percent of pomegranate juice in this product or 

24

there was 15 percent.  In Petitioner's view, a Lanham 

25

Act claim could still go forward in those circumstances

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

because there would be no irreconcilable conflict. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Then, Ms. Sherry, you 

3

the government is taking the position that it's okay for 

4

District Courts to determine whether labels, in fact, 

5

comply or don't comply with FDA regulations? 

6

 MS. SHERRY: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
And if they decide they 

8

don't comply, that's when they can could permit a Lanham 

9

Act claim? 

10

 MS. SHERRY: 

That's correct.  And let me try 

11

to explain why I don't think  that's inconsistent with 

12

the notion of the FDA having exclusive enforcement 

13

authority with respect to the FDCA.  This is still a 

14

Lanham Act claim.  So the only thing that is being 

15

enforced is the Lanham Act.  The FDCA and the FDA 

16

regulations come up by virtue of the preclusion defense 

17

that is being raised by Respondents here.  And so in the 

18

course of adjudicating that defense, we agree that 

19

district courts can look to the FDA regulations to 

20

determine compliance, of course, by applying all the 

21

normal rules of deference that would otherwise apply in 

22

those circumstances.  And as my colleague 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do I understand your 

24

position to be that then if the label is specifically 

25

authorized, then the Lanham Act is precluded, but if the

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

FDCA has just simply failed to forbid it then it's not? 

2

Is that your distinction you draw. 

3
4

7

 MS. SHERRY: 

I think so.  If I could just 

articulate it 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Because if it is, I think 

it's very hard to work with. 
 MS. SHERRY: 

And I will try to articulate it 

8

slightly differently and explain why we don't think it 

9

is difficult to work with.  What we're saying is that if 

10

the FDA or the FDCA provisions have specifically 

11

permitted something here, they've specifically permitted 

12

this type of name in certain circumstances, that that is 

13

something that should preclude a Lanham Act claim.  To 

14

the extent the FDCA or the FDA has not spoken to the 

15

particular issue with any degree of specificity, we 

16

don't see a problem with the Lanham Act claim going 

17

forward, because in that case you're not really second

18

guessing any judgment 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But, Ms. Sherry, applied 

20

to this case, so we have  you said the name is okay, 

21

pomegranate and blueberry flavored, but you say the 

22

label is something different from the name and the 

23

Lanham Act can apply to the label.  So what parts of the 

24

label are you saying are not touched  are not 

25

preempted by the FDA laws?

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. SHERRY: 

We're drawing a distinction 

2

when we say the name, we mean the actual words 

3

themselves, "pomegranate blueberry flavored blendified 

4

juices."  When we talk about the label more generally, 

5

we mean how those words are presented on the label and 

6

other aspects of the label. 

7

 And if I could point the Court to the Nestle 

8

warning letter, it's discussed in a number of the 

9

different briefs and it's cited at footnote 7 of our 

10

brief.  I think my colleague was going to bring it up 

11

earlier.  I actually think this letter proves the very 

12

distinction that we're trying to make.  What the FDA 

13

said in that letter was that the juice labels at issue 

14

there were misleading, not because of the name, but 

15

because how the words of the name were displayed on the 

16

label, because the words "orange tangerine," for 

17

example, were placed next to the picture of an orange, 

18

because they were in close proximity to "100 percent" 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What if the label 

20

just had the name on it, nothing else?  Could they still 

21

sue on the ground that the label was misleading? 

22

 MS. SHERRY: 

Not unless they are able to 

23

point to something else on the label that was misleading 

24

aside from the actual words in the name.  The difficulty 

25

we have with the naming aspect of the Lanham Act claim

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here is the arguments that Petitioner is making that 

2

they should have instead named this "apple grape juice," 

3

that they should have instead included the percentage 

4

declarations, are arguments that the FDA 

5

specifically considered when it adopted this rule and it 

6

ultimately objected. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Does the FDA  does 

8

the FDA take into account purely commercial confusion 

9

when it issues  when it issued its regulations 

10

governing the label?  Or is it limited solely to the, 

11

what I would expect, you know, the health and wellbeing 

12

concerns? 

13

 MS. SHERRY: 

It absolutely took into account 

14

 into account consumer confusion.  There were comments 

15

with respect to this particular regulation, and the 

16

commenters were consumers saying that they were 

17

concerned that they were being misled with respect to 

18

the juice content. 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What does the FDA 

20

know about that?  I mean, I would understand if it was 

21

the FTC or something like that, but I don't know that 

22

the FDA has any expertise in terms of consumer confusion 

23

apart from any health issues. 

24
25

 MS. SHERRY: 

I'm not sure that is right. 

The misbranding provisions, 343(a)(1), speak generally

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about labels that are false or misleading in any 

2

particular.  And in adopting the common or usual name 

3

here, that is something that the FDA was specifically 

4

focused on. 

5

 The other point I would make is, in 

6

the court of appeals in the reply brief at page 23, the 

7

Petitioner acknowledges and argues that the misleading 

8

standard for the Lanham Act and for the FDCA are not 

9

materially different from one another. 

10
11
12

 Another point I would make with respect 
to the regulation 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Sherry, you know, there 

13

is no irreconcilable conflict if we view what the FDA 

14

has done as just setting a floor.  And you talk a lot 

15

about how, oh, the FDA specifically considered this and 

16

it decided not to do this.  You put a lot of emphasis on 

17

process. 

18

 And I guess my question to you is, is that 

19

the way you are saying we should know whether the FDA 

20

has only set a floor or instead has also set a ceiling, 

21

that we're supposed to look to the process and figure 

22

out whether the FDA specifically rejected a more 

23

extensive proposal, a more aggressive proposal? 

24
25

 MS. SHERRY: 

No.  I think you look to 

whether or not allowing the claim to go forward would

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

complement what the agency has done or would actually 

2

conflict with what the agency has done.  And here, we 

3

think there is a real conflict.  We're not talking about 

4

supplementing the agency's enforcement resources.  We're 

5

talking about supplanting their regulatory judgment in 

6

the area. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I guess I don't 

8

understand that.  Why wouldn't it complement?  You've 

9

said here is the floor to make it not misleading, but, 

10

you know, we are not saying that there are some things 

11

that, you know, wouldn't mislead a lot of consumers 

12

anyway, and then the Lanham Act can come in and 

13

supplement that and really put us in a position where 

14

nothing is misleading at all. 

15

 MS. SHERRY: 

Oh, for two reasons.  Number 

16

one, because the agency considered why manufacturers 

17

would want to actually name their product based on the 

18

flavor, because consumers actually do care about the 

19

flavor and they care about the taste.  If the product 

20

had the name "apple grape juice," for example, and it in 

21

fact tasted like pomegranate blueberry juice, a consumer 

22

might be very surprised when he came home and had a sip 

23

of that juice and realized it tasted like something very 

24

different than what he expected. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You don't think there are a

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lot of people who buy pomegranate juice because of 

2

they think it has health benefits and they would be very 

3

surprised to find when they bring home this bottle 

4

that's got a big picture of a pomegranate on it and it 

5

says "pomegranate" on it, that it is  what is it, less 

6

than onehalf of one percent pomegranate juice? 

7

 MS. SHERRY: 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

9

would mislead consumers? 

10

 MS. SHERRY: 

And I think 
The FDA didn't think that 

I think  I think there is a 

11

reasonable argument that it may.  And if I could just go 

12

to the second part of my argument here.  We've been 

13

talking all about the naming part of the claim at issue 

14

here.  We agree with Petitioners that the remainder of 

15

the Lanham Act claim shouldn't be allowed to proceed, 

16

that it is complementary.  We agree with Petitioners 

17

that the Ninth Circuit decision here adopted an overly 

18

broad understanding of preclusion. 

19

 Now respondent suggests it doesn't defend the 

20

Ninth Circuit's decision here in footnote 5 of their 

21

brief, but it's a little bit hard to see what daylight 

22

there actually is between the Ninth  Circuit's 

23

approach and that of Respondent.  Respondent relies on 

24

the express preemption clause here, but the express 

25

preemption clause applies only to State or local law.

24

Alderson Reporting Company

By its terms, it doesn't apply to Federal law and it

doesn't apply to the Lanham Act.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The FDCA does not deal just with health. 

10

Section 341 makes clear that it also and with respect to 

11

the labeling requirements at issue here, quote, 

12

"promotes honesty and fair dealing in the interest of 

13

consumers."  And here, the most important data we have 

14

about what Congress did that's barely been mentioned by 

15

POM or the government, is the enactment in 1990 of the 

16

NLEA, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, and its 

17

express preemption provision. 

18

 Now, Justice Kennedy, our position is that 

19

if POM's suit had been brought as a State law lawsuit, 

20

it would be precisely preempted by the terms of that 

21

express preemption provision. 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the NLEA provision 

23

doesn't preempt all State law claims, only some State 

24

law claims. 

25

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

That's correct, Justice

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Ginsburg.  And it preempts precisely these claims if 

2

they had been brought As state law claims, because let's 

3

look at the language of the express preemption 

4

provision. And To be clear, CocaCola's position is very 

5

narrow.  Our position is that were these claims that POM 

6

is making brought as State law claims, they would be 

7

expressly preempted, and it cannot be that Congress 

8

meant to preempt these claims if brought as State law 

9

claims designed to go above the Federal floor, but 

10

meant to say never mind 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, why can't it be?  I 

12

mean, there are plenty of statutes which say you can't 

13

bring State law or Federal law claims.  Congress knows 

14

how to do that.  And instead, it said you can only 

15

not bring State law claims. 

16

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

In fact, Justice Kagan, it's 

17

very rare that Congress actually says no State or 

18

Federal claims. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

They just say no claims or 

no  notwithstanding any law to the contrary. 
 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Fair enough, Your Honor.  But 

22

you have said in numerous cases in which you have found 

23

a prior or more general law narrowed by a subsequent or 

24

more specific law, you have said Congress should not be 

25

put to the burden every time it enacts a statute of

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

looking to the four corners of the U.S. Code and 

2

figuring out what it might displace.  And there is no 

3

reason 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Do you have an example, 

5

Ms. Sullivan, of a case where Congress precluded some 

6

State claims and said nothing at all about Federal laws 

7

in which this Court has held that the express preclusion 

8

of State law claims implicitly precluded Federal claims? 

9

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

I cannot, Justice Ginsburg, 

10

though I can cite to you the most relevant and unbroken 

11

line of court of appeals authority, which are the 

12

Federal Railroad Safety Act cases.  The Federal Railroad 

13

Safety Act expressly preempted State law negligence 

14

claims, and the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Circuits have 

15

held, without a competing circuit, that therefore, 

16

Federal  FELA negligence claims must be deemed to be 

17

precluded, because otherwise, the national scheme of 

18

uniformity in Federal railroad safety would be 

19

undermined.  So, too, here. 

20

 And if I could just go back, Justice 

21

Ginsburg, to make sure I answer the question.  The 

22

passage of the NLEA and its express preemption provision 

23

in 1990 was all about national uniformity.  In fact, 

24

what Congress aimed at in passing that statute was 

25

the 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is it part of Coke's 

2

narrow position that national uniformity consists in 

3

labels that cheat the consumers like this one did? 

4

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Justice Kennedy, you have 

5

perhaps succumbed to Mr. Waxman's attempts to argue his 

6

jury argument here.  We're on a motion to dismiss. 

7

There is no record.  We've put in a brief 

8
9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I think it's important for 

us to know how the statutes work.  And if the statute 

10

works in the way you say it does and that CocaCola 

11

stands behind this label as being fair to consumers, 

12

then I think you have a very difficult case to make.  I 

13

think it's relevant for us to ask whether people are 

14

cheated in buying this product.  Because CocaCola's 

15

position is to say even if they are, there's nothing we 

16

can do about it.  Do you still have this  do you still 

17

have this label? 

18

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Yes, Your Honor.  It's 

19

changed in nonmaterial aspects.  There is no aspect 

20

covered by the claims here that has changed. 

21

 But I just want to be very, very clear on 

22

what POM is arguing here.  POM is arguing  and, 

23

Justice Sotomayor, they are not arguing your 

24

hypothetical.  POM is arguing here that it may challenge 

25

CocaCola's name and label under the Lanham Act even if

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that name and label complies with the FDCA and all the 

2

relevant implementing regulations.  So, Justice Kagan, 

3

this is exactly your case, where POM said it can say 

4

misbranded under the Lanham Act, even where CocaCola 

5

has complied with all of the authorizations set forth in 

6

the FDA. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But maybe the two acts 

8

are serving different purposes, Ms. Sullivan.  The law 

9

that you are relying on is supposed to be concerned with 

10

nutritional information and health claims, not a 

11

competitor is a competitor losing out because of the 

12

deception.  The consumer is able to buy the Coke product 

13

much cheaper and the POM product costs more; the 

14

consumer thinks that they are both the same, so they'll 

15

buy the cheaper one. 

16

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

First, Justice Ginsburg, let 

17

me be clear:  Safety is not at issue in this case. 

18

Safety warnings are especially carved out.  Justice 

19

Alito, if there is a worry about allergies; Chief 

20

Justice Roberts, if there is a worry about health. 

21

That's not what we're about here.  In fact, the NLEA 

22

especially  expressly in 6(c)(2) carved out safety 

23

warnings from the preemption clause.  We're not talking 

24

here about safety. 

25

 we're talking here about labeling so that

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consumers have adequate information, at the same time as 

2

manufacturers are not put to the burdens and 

3

inefficiencies of having constantly shifting labeling 

4

standards imposed by juries, which ultimately will cost 

5

more to the consumer. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, let's  let's 

7

assume the following.  The FDA just wanted to know what 

8

the name should be.  That's all they are regulating. 

9

That's the only requirement.  And it's not even a 

10

requirement. 

11

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It's an authorization. 
It's an authorization. 

13

And that's where I'm having a little bit of difficulty, 

14

because it's not that you have to use this name, you're 

15

permitted to use this name under their regulations.  But 

16

why are you permitted to use it in a misleading way? 

17

That's really the  I think the government's position, 

18

which is, if you're using the name in combination with 

19

other factors in a misleading way that's not a subject 

20

to the regulation, just the name, then it's actionable 

21

under the Lanham Act. 

22

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Justice Sotomayor and Justice 

23

Kennedy, I need to make very clear that we believe that 

24

under the FDCA and the FDA regulations, Coke's label is 

25

as a matter of law not misleading.  And once we reach

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that conclusion under FDCA and FDA, Lanham Act can't 

2

come in from the side and say, oh, yes, it is, because 

3

that would undermine the express preemption provision 

4

that was designed to create national uniformity. 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could the government 

6

I think what the government is saying nothing about our 

7

permission goes to the size of the name on the label 

8

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, Your Honor 
 that you can break up 

10

the name of the juice into two different sizes so that 

11

you are deemphasizing it.  It also says that the 

12

vignette is misleading because it shows products that 

13

have potentially nothing in their regulations say 

14

anything about  vignettes  and how they display them. 

15

It's  nothing in the regulations talk about using 

16

purple instead of whatever that color is that the juice 

17

is, that blue, purple, whatever, instead of the color of 

18

apple juice.  If you use the color of apple juice and 

19

grapes, it would be a  light color. 

20

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Justice Sotomayor, there are 

21

five different attacks that POM has made on our label, 

22

only two of which were addressed in the lower court. 

23

And we say that we comply with FDA regulations as to all 

24

five of them.  But more important, compliance doesn't 

25

matter; what matters is are these of the type covered by

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the provisions of the NLEA preemption provision 

2

sorry.  Are these of a type covered through the NLEA 

3

preemption provision? 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You basically are 

talking about field preemption. 
 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Absolutely not, Your Honor. 

7

Let me make absolutely clear we do not argue for field 

8

preemption.  We argue that where the NLEA express 

9

preemption provision would make POM's claims expressly 

10

preempted under State law, it follows as a matter of 

11

inference from the national uniform scheme that Congress 

12

set up, that Lanham Act claims are precluded to the 

13

extent and only to the extent the state claims would 

14

have been preempted under if they were brought as state 

15

law claims. 

16

 Now, Justice Sotomayor, all five of POM's 

17

issues here  name, vignette, font size, multiple 

18

lines, and coloring  name, vignette, font size, 

19

multiple lines, and coloring  every one of those is of 

20

the type required by certain enumerated sections in the 

21

NLEA express preemption provision.  And POM wants 

22

something that is not identical. 

23

 Justice Ginsburg, POM doesn't just want to 

24

enjoin our label.  POM at JA61 said:  You should have 

25

called it apple grape juice, not pomegranate blueberry

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

juice. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, Mr. Waxman 

3

clarified that that's not what they are seeking.  They 

4

just want to say your label is misleading.  And is 

5

there  what statute or regulation of the FDA says that 

6

compliance with the permissive regulation of the FDA 

7

necessarily renders the label nonmisleading? 

8
9

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Justice Ginsburg, every 

single aspect of their misleadingness claim is covered 

10

by specific provisions of the FDCA that have preemptive 

11

force.  Under  I just want you to focus, if on nothing 

12

else, because my colleagues on the other side haven't 

13

even mentioned it, on 21 USC 3431)(a)(2) and (3), the 

14

express preemption provision.  The express preemption 

15

provision says

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Where is that set 

forth in the 
 MS. SULLIVAN: 

It's set forth, Mr. Chief 

Justice, in the red brief addendum at page 5A. 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Okay. 

And if you look at the 

22

express preemption provision, which is notably called 

23

"National Uniform Nutrition Labeling," Section (2) and 

24

Section (3) on 5A over to 6A, set forth those portions 

25

of the FDCA that will and won't have preemptive force.

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

We are living in this case entirely within two sections 

2

that have preemptive force under this statute, and those 

3

are sections 343(i) and 343(f).  "Name" is covered by 

4

343(i).  "Vignette" is covered by 343(i) because, as the 

5

Federal Register makes clear, name and vignette were 

6

thought of together. 

7

 "Font size" is covered by 343(f), which goes 

8

to the presentation of the name and other printed matter 

9

on the label.  "Multiple lines" is covered by 343(f), 

10
11

and "coloring" is covered by 343(i)(2). 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Sullivan, can I ask 

12

if this gets you away from the argument you want to 

13

make, I apologize for that.  But suppose we thought that 

14

the preemption provision here was utterly irrelevant, 

15

that it applies to state law and not Federal law, and 

16

that you can't go around broadening the statute just 

17

because the purposes behind that statute might be 

18

thought to apply to something else.  So suppose I just 

19

put that aside.  Do you still have any kind of argument? 

20

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Yes, Your Honor, we still win 

21

because of your more general approach to preclusion by 

22

one Federal statute of another, because the FDA 

23

regulations as to misbranding here are far more 

24

specific.  Let me back up.  The statute of the FDCA and 

25

the regulations promulgated thereunder are more specific

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

than the general misrepresentation provisions of the 

2

Lanham Act. 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But you say that even 

4

I  I take it I'm characterizing your position right. 

5

You say that even if there's a violation of the FDA 

6

regulations, they still couldn't sue under the Lanham 

7

Act because that's for the FDA.

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

We do  we do not take that 

position here, Your Honor, because it's not presented 
here.  We said there might 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I thought that was  I 

thought that was at Page 39 in your brief in a footnote. 
 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Justice Kennedy, let me be 

14

clear.  In this case we believe the Lanham Act claim is 

15

precluded because POM wants to go above the floor set by 

16

the FDCA and the FDA reg.  POM has said repeatedly in 

17

this case, right through the reply brief  right 

18

through its reply brief at Page 17, and I quote, and 

19

this has been their position the whole time, POM's 

20

challenge does not depend on the FDCA or FDA's 

21

regulation. 

22

 Justice Sotomayor, POM is not bringing your 

23

hypothetical suit where they come in to enforce the FDCA 

24

and the FDA.  Had they done so, we think there might be 

25

a serious question for you to resolve another day about

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether that's an end run around 337(a)'s restriction of 

2

enforcement to the United States and prohibition of 

3

private lawsuits, but that's not this case. 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I understood them to say 

5

they were making a Lanham Act challenge.  And there is 

6

no judicial review of the FDA regulations.  There's no 

7

private right of action under the FDA. 

8

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Correct, Your Honor. 
So they are not saying, 

10

We're bringing an action under the FDCA or the NLEA. 

11

They say, We're bringing a Lanham Act. 

12

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

13

 But what I'm trying to say here is, to the 

Correct, Your Honor. 

14

extent their Lanham Act claims seeks to say, as Justice 

15

Kagan said before, You are misbranded for 

16

misrepresentations under the Lanham Act, even though 

17

Coke has not been misbranded and has not made 

18

misrepresentations under FDCA and the FDA regulations, 

19

that is a conflict that should be resolved by this Court 

20

in the usual manner that statutory construction 

21

conflicts are resolved by making the statutes make sense 

22

together. 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I don't know why 

24

I don't know why it's impossible to have a label that 

25

fully complies with the FDA regulations and also happens

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to be misleading on the entirely different question of 

2

commercial competition, consumer confusion that has 

3

nothing to do with health. 

4

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, as I said 

5

before, the FTC in Section 341 as codified expressly 

6

refers to maintaining honesty for the consumer as well 

7

as health.  But just let me suggest why there is still a 

8

conflict, and irreconcilable conflict is not the 

9

touchstone.  You have never required irreconcilable 

10

conflict in  in all the cases we have cited in our 

11

brief, Fausto and Elgin, Keogh, Romani, Daystar.  You've 

12

never required irreconcilable conflict.  You've 

13

recognized that one federal statute, if more specific, 

14

may narrow the scope of a more general statute where 

15

there is a conflict. 

16

 And there is a conflict here, Your Honor. 

17

Just to be clear, what Congress wanted was national 

18

uniformity so that a manufacturer could print one label 

19

and sell in the 50 states and not have its juice legal 

20

when you leave on the flight in California and 

21

illegal when you land in D.C.  That national uniformity 

22

bill 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, the Lanham  the 

Lanham Act applies nationally. 
 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Correct, Your Honor, but the

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

falsity standard 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you're  you used a 

3

state preemption and then say we should apply the same 

4

principles to two federal statutes 

5

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

7
8
9

We do, Your Honor. 
 but that's a quite 

different point. 
 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Here's what I'm saying, 

Justice Kennedy.  I'm saying after the NLEA express 

10

preemption provision, a state cannot say that 

11

pomegranateblueberryflavored blend of five juices 

12

which is perfectly consistent with the naming 

13

regulations, as the U.S. agrees.  Why is that?  Because 

14

the naming regulations, Justice Sotomayor, said, you can 

15

name your minority juice, your nonpredominant juice in 

16

either of two ways.  You, as a manufacturer, may either 

17

mention a percentage or 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You want us to  you want 

19

us to write an opinion that said that Congress enacted a 

20

statutory scheme because it intended that no matter how 

21

misleading or how deceptive a label it is, if it passes 

22

the FDA, it cannot  it  there can be no liability. 

23

That's what you want us to say? 

24
25

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

We do not, Your Honor.  We 

would want you to say that what misleading is when it is

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defined by FDA in specific regulations pursuant to a 

2

specific statute that specifically seeks national 

3

uniformity, in the sense that the manufacturer picks one 

4

label and doesn't, as the American Beverage Association 

5

brief says at Page 7, create a logistical nightmare that 

6

you have to change your label in response to every jury 

7

verdict.  We're saying that once your 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Let's suppose there were 

a consumer survey, as there was, but  and  and say 

10

it was a valid survey.  And overwhelmingly, consumers 

11

said that they are misled, that they thought that they 

12

were getting pure pomegranate, and they were just 

13

astonished to find what they were getting was apple 

14

juice with, what Mr. Waxman told us, a dropper of 

15

blueberry. 

16

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

18
19

Justice 
Suppose  suppose the 

reality is that consumers are misled. 
 MS. SULLIVAN: 

If I suppose that, Your 

20

Honor, then the proper procedure for a consumer or a 

21

competitor is to go to the FDA and seek FDA's change of 

22

its rulemaking.  Your Honor, in the red addendum  red 

23

brief addendum at Page 17(a) over to 18(a), you'll see 

24

that in 21 CFR 102.33(d) FDA said, Your juice will not 

25

be misleading if it uses the word "flavored."

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And in fact, over on 18(a), if you want to 

2

see the closest thing to an express authorization of our 

3

label here, it's the example that FDA gave on 18(a).  It 

4

said, You can use either flavor or a percentage, and it 

5

won't be misleading.  Why?  Because we don't think that 

6

consumers are quite as unintelligent as POM must think 

7

they are.  They know when something is a favored blend 

8

of five juices, nonmin  the nonpredominant juices 

9

are just a flavor. 

10
11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Don't make me feel bad 

because I thought that this was pomegranate juice. 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Justice Kennedy  Justice 

14

Kennedy, it's pomegranateblueberryflavored blend of 

15

five juices.  I've found that oftentimes  well 

16
17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

He sometimes doesn't read 

closely enough. 

18

 (Laughter.) 

19

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Yeah, 

20

pomegranateblueberryflavored blend of five juices. 

21

And the key point here 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

How do we square this 

with Wyeth? 

24

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Your Honor 
Wyeth, the FDA actually

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

approves, looks at the label and says, this one is okay. 

2

Not only is it not misleading, but it complies with all 

3

health requirements, and because the producers of drugs 

4

have the ability to change the label without FDA 

5

approval, there was  we found no preemptions and no 

6

impossibility. 

7

 How is Wyeth any different? 

The FDA here 

8

it's even worse, this case.  The FDA doesn't approve the 

9

labels.  It never looks at them and says they are okay 

10

or not okay unless they decide to enforce the statute. 

11

How is this better than Wyeth? 

12

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Two important distinctions, 

13

Your Honor, but let me first disagree with the premise. 

14

It's true that FDA doesn't preapprove the label, but 

15

they couldn't have gotten closer here, Justice Kennedy, 

16

than solving your difficulty by saying that 

17

rascranberry juice, it's okay if you call it 

18

raspberryandcranberryflavored juice drink.  You don't 

19

have to put the percentages in. 

20
21
22

 So this is  it's not a preapproval 
requirement, but these regulations are very specific. 
 Justice Sotomayor, Wyeth, as you said, as 

23

this Court said, did not involve an express preemption 

24

provision.  It is the express preemption provision here 

25

that says that Congress wanted nationally uniform

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

labeling regulations whereby a manufacturer could pick 

2

one label and stick with it.  This is Guyer, not Wyeth. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You assume people would 

4

pick a label and stick with it.  The Lanham Act would 

5

if a Lanham Act claim is bought, and it's upheld, you 

6

change the label nationally. 

7

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Oh, but, Your Honor, that's 

8

one thing if the FDA decides to adapt its rulemaking. 

9

Suppose Justice Ginsberg's consumers or competitors 

10

showed up and said, Excuse me, we don't think 

11

rascranberry is clear enough.  Justice Kennedy said it 

12

wasn't.  Please change your rulemaking. 

13

 When the FDA issues guidance or changes its 

14

rules or issues a new kind of interpretation, that's one 

15

agency speaking nationally.  What Mr. Waxman wants to do 

16

is invite plaintiffs to walk into every court in the 

17

land under Lanham Act claims and create one jury saying, 

18

I think you should have called it applegrape juice, and 

19

another saying you should have had the percentage. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: Ms. Sullivan, 

I would like you to 

21

respond to this question:  In the real world, the FDA 

22

has a tremendous amount of things on its plate, and 

23

labels for juices are not really high on its list.  It 

24

has very limited resources.  You are asking us to take 

25

what it has said about juice as blessing this label,

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

saying it's not misbranding, when its regulations aren't 

2

reviewed by the Court, when there is no private right of 

3

action, and say that that overtakes the Lanham Act. 

4

It's  it's really very hard to conceive that Congress 

5

would have done that. 

6

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Justice Ginsburg, precisely 

7

for the reasons you say, you should affirm here and go 

8

with us in precluding the Lanham Act claims.  And the 

9

reason is that Congress has authorized a very specific 

10

regulatory regime here.  Of course you don't want the 

11

FDA deciding is pomegranateblueberry or rascranberry 

12

clear  that's why they gave specific regulations.  And 

13

contrary to what Mr. Waxman said, the FDA does not just 

14

have criminal jurisdiction.  It has adjudicatory 

15

jurisdiction.  It has civil authority.  It can issue 

16

warning letters, which, as the amicus brief of 

17

Mr. Friedman points out, are very effective. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But the point is that it 

19

is doubtful that FDA has sufficient resources to police 

20

food and beverage labeling.  I think that was the thrust 

21

of Justice Ginsburg's question.  I had the same concern. 

22

And this is relevant because we want to see what the 

23

likely intention of Congress was with reference to these 

24

two statutes. 

25

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Justice Kennedy, the U.S.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position is unworkable, as you said before.  And the 

2

U.S. hasn't said that they lack sufficient resources. 

3

What we would respectfully suggest you look at is not 

4

FDA's latest amicus brief through the U.S., but FDA's 

5

authoritative statement about whether its labeling 

6

regulations were being implemented. 

7

 In the red brief at Page 7, we cite to the 

8

rulemaking in which the FDA found after the threeyear 

9

study  remember the express preemption provision 

10

couldn't go into force until there was a threeyear 

11

study by the IOM.  And if you look at Page 7 of the red 

12

brief, threequarters of the way down the page, you'll 

13

see FDA in its authoritative statement, irrespective of 

14

its amicus brief here, found that 343(f), the 

15

presentation regulation, and 343(i), the naming 

16

regulation, were being adequately implemented. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So that's contrary to its 

18

current position, and I think we have to take it  the 

19

FDA is  is  the government is representing the 

20

current FDA position. 

21

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

But, Your Honor, you don't 

22

give our deference to an amicus brief when there's an 

23

authoritative prior statement by FDA that these 

24

implementation  for the very reason you suggest, the 

25

FDA has other things to do.

44

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Would that  without 

2

regard to deference, we don't resurrect the statement 

3

that they no longer support. 

4

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Well, Your Honor, they 

5

haven't disavowed that statement.  We would respectfully 

6

suggest that just as it's too late for Mr. Waxman to 

7

change his theory, as you said in Riegel, to a  we're 

8

enforcing the FDA theory  and he doesn't purport to do 

9

it here  it's  the FDA, it's too late now to say in 

10
11

an amicus brief that they didn't mean it back in 1993. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you think, Ms. Sullivan, 

12

that there are any Lanham suits regarding food labels 

13

that are allowable? 

14

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Yes, Your Honor.  Putting 

15

aside the private enforcement 337(a) problem that 

16

Justice Sotomayor raised before, we believe that Lanham 

17

Act suits are not preempted  would not be preempted as 

18

state law claims, and, therefore, are not precluded as 

19

Lanham Act claims, if they fall outside the specific 

20

provisions of FDCA that have preemptive force.  So 

21

343(a)  may I finish, your Honor? 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

23

 MS. SULLIVAN: 

Yes. 

If there is something that is 

24

not covered  name, vignette, font, multiplized are 

25

covered.  If there's something else that's not

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

covered  and I would refer Your Honor to 

2

specifically to religious dietary labeling, bottle 

3

container deposit labeling  those are things that the 

4

FDA said in its rulemaking, based on the Congressional 

5

record, are outside the specific provisions with 

6

preemptive force.  Then, assuming there's no 337 

7

problem, you can have a Lanham Act claim.  All we say is

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. Waxman, you have 

seven minutes remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

16

 MR. WAXMAN: 

17

 I need to correct a few misstatements by my 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

18

colleague, Ms. Sullivan.  First of all, this threeyear 

19

study that she's referring to, as we pointed out in our 

20

brief, the IOM and the FDA made absolutely clear 

21

repeatedly in that study that they did not look at FDA's 

22

enforcement capabilities, its enforcement efforts.  It 

23

had  it simply was a judgment about whether the 

24

specific forbearance regulations that they promulgated, 

25

in fact, adequately accomplished what Congress's

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

objectives were. 

2

 Number two, we  we are not saying that 

3

this is a misbranded product.  We are not trying to 

4

enforce the FDCA.  And the FD  and the FDA itself has 

5

made clear, not only in its brief in this case and not 

6

only in its enforcement action in the Nestle case, but 

7

in the Federal Register discussion of the juice naming 

8

regulation, that the fact that the juice may comply 

9

and here it probably doesn't  may comply with the 

10
11

naming convention does not mean that it is misleading. 
 The FDA said over and over again in that 

12

rulemaking that we strongly caution manufacturers that, 

13

in fact, mere compliance with this does not mean that 

14

the label is misleading and  and that manufacturers 

15

are under an obligation to ensure that the label is not 

16

misleading.  Now, as to the question of 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Where  where is that 

statement contained? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

That is in 58  the statements 

20

that I'm quoting are in 58 Federal Register, Pages 2900, 

21

2919, and 2920. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

23

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Thank you. 
And also, indeed said, 

24

nonetheless, we encourage manufacturers to name all of 

25

the juices in a multiple juice product specifically

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because it was concerned about this. 

2

 Now, Ms. Sullivan says, well, you know, not 

3

all Lanham Act claims are preempt  precluded.  They 

4

wouldn't be precluded if the parallel cognate state law 

5

enforcement of an identical standard wouldn't be 

6

precluded. 

7

 This is  the closest cognate here is 

8

343(a), which provides that a food is misbranded if it 

9

is false  if the label is false and  false or 

10

misleading at any particular.  That isn't in this sort 

11

of Swiss cheese exception  exemptionfilled preemption 

12

provision of the NLEA.  That one isn't preempted.  There 

13

is nothing whatsoever that preempts any person from 

14

going into state court and enforcing a state law 

15

provision that recites in haec verba 343(a). 

16

 Now, Ms. Sullivan says, okay, we're not 

17

worried here.  The FDA wasn't worried here about health 

18

or safety.  That's not what's going on here. 

19

 That is the point. 

That is the point.  It's 

20

because there were concerns about health and safety with 

21

this juice naming regulation that they said, in the 

22

exercise of our sovereign enforcement authority, we are 

23

not going to go after you for complying with this naming 

24

convention, because, as they've explained, we don't know 

25

anything about how to protect competitors.  We don't

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purport to know what is in the competitive marketplace. 

2

And we aren't about writing regulations under these 

3

criminal provisions. 

4

 And Ms. Sullivan is right. 

There are civil 

5

enforcement mechanisms, but they're all enforced by 

6

juries.  We aren't going to go this way because this is 

7

not our job.  It's not our expertise.  And yet, 

8

interesting 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Waxman, I  take it that 

10

Ms. Sherry said that the FDA views itself as having a 

11

job beyond health and safety, that they view themselves 

12

as at least  not thinking about competitors' welfare or 

13

lack thereof, but at least thinking about consumer 

14

understanding of labels. 

15

 So if that's the case, is the determination 

16

under the Lanham Act different from the determination 

17

under the FDCA? 

18

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Very definitely, and for  for 

19

some of the reasons that this Court discussed in the 

20

Lexmark case, where you were talking about who can sue 

21

under the Lanham Act and who's protected.  And the Court 

22

noted that, of course, consumer confusion itself can be 

23

the engine for a  competitive harm. 

24

 But the former is not what the Lanham Act is 

25

about, and the latter, the FDA has made perfectly clear

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

is not what the FDCA is about. 
 And interestingly, even with respect to this 

3

naming provision, and, you know, we  the government 

4

agrees with us far more than it disagrees with us, but 

5

our disagreement about the preclusive effect of their 

6

judgment is important. 

7

 You know, they say, okay, we  we spent a 

8

lot of time on these regulations, and we are entitled to 

9

chevron deference.  And we think they are entitled to 

10

Chevron deference with respect to interpreting the 

11

misbranding provisions that they are in fact  that 

12

they do enforce. 

13

 They're asking as  their submission here 

14

is not  not  not just in an FDA action, enforcement 

15

action in court, will we get chevron deference for our 

16

interpretation of what the meaning of 343(i)(1) is. 

17

 But in a Lanham Act case, we get chevron on 

18

steroids deference.  We get to basically keep you of out 

19

of court entire  you're not even allowed to make that 

20

claim. 

21

 That is an astonishing proposition, and it 

22

is one that there is nothing whatsoever in the 

23

legislative history, the language of the statute, 

24

anything at all to indicate that Congress wanted 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Any authority that the FDA

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretation gets deference is presumed to be correct, 

2

or presumed to be not misleading?  Has there ever been 

3

any scholarship or commentary or cases saying that? 

4

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, certainly not in the 

5

Lanham Act context.  There's been no suggestion that 

6

they have anything whatsoever to say about the Lanham 

7

Act.  Knowing the professoriate, I'm sure there must be 

8

some commentary about whether they do or don't get 

9

chevron deference.  But Ms. Sullivan says that they 

10

don't and the government says that they do.  And there 

11

must be a scholar at least on each side of that 

12

position, but I simply don't know.  I will make one 

13

final point. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If there is a Lanham Act 

15

suit and the regulation is brought forward to prevent 

16

the suit, cannot the party against whom it's brought 

17

forward say the regulation is 

18
19
20
21
22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

We certainly intend to say that 

if it becomes relevant, absolutely. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So it's not on steroids 

then.  You can still apply 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, I  right.  I think that 

23

it doesn't apply at all.  The government would take the 

24

position that it has preclusive authority. 

25

 Thank you.
