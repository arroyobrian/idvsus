CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear, first,

this morning, Case 08-769, United States v. Stevens.

5

Mr. Katyal.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

Ten years ago, in Section 48 of Title 18,

11

Congress crafted a narrowly targeted restriction against

12

certain depictions of actual animal cruelty.

13

Third Circuit struck the statute down on its face

14

without even attempting to apply substantial overbreadth

15

analysis.

16

just as the Court last year in United States v. Williams

17

began with statutory construction, analysis should begin

18

there.

19

Yet the

The statute has four critical features and,

First, like the statute at issue in the

20

United States v. Ferber, this statute only reaches

21

depictions of cruelty to actual living beings -

22

animals, not simulated ones or the written word.

23

Second, the statute only applies to

24

commercial messages, ones that Congress found drove the

25

market for animal cruelty.

Third, the statute examines the work as a
whole JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What record do you have

of that fact?

5

MR. KATYAL:

Before Congress?

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. KATYAL:

Yes.

Before Congress -- Congress had

8

a bunch of testimony that showed that there were

9

extensive -- there was a robust market in animal cruelty

10

videos, largely focusing on crush videos -- 2 to 3,000

11

crush videos that were in -- that were -- that were

12

being sold at the time.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That I understand, but

14

crush videos is only one species of cruelty to animals.

15

What evidence was there that, for example, dog fighting

16

had as large and robust a market or that hunting videos

17

in those States in which hunting was illegal had a

18

robust market, et cetera?

19

MR. KATYAL:

Well, hunting we think is

20

excluded, and I could talk about that in a moment, from

21

the reach of the act.

22

and I don't think that Mr. Stevens's statement at page

23

13 of his merits brief, which is to the effect that

24

Congress repeatedly disavowed any attempt to regulate

25

animal fighting -- dog fighting -- I don't think that is

Congress spoke in general terms,

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

correct and the record does not support that.

2

Congress spoke in general terms.

They had a

3

for-profit commercial market about animal cruelty, and

4

the statute dealt with it in general terms.

5

reasoned that by -- by punishing the sale of these

6

videotapes, they would get at the underlying clandestine

7

market -

8
9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And they

What do you mean by a

"for-profit commercial market"?

You mean anything that

is sold, right?

11

MR. KATYAL:

That is -- that is correct.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. KATYAL:

14

And the Third Circuit's decision in this

Okay.

Yes.

15

case struck down the statute with respect to crush

16

videos, with respect to the sale of video -- the

17

creation of dog fighting videotapes, because, remember,

18

the statute, Section 48, doesn't just encompass the -

19

the sale of videotapes.

20

creation of dog fighting videotapes.

21

the Third Circuit struck that down as well.

22

think, was a fundamental error under this Court's

23

principles, most particularly, United States v.

24

Williams, which says that the statute should only be

25

struck down if there is a substantial -- if there is

It also encompasses the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

And, yet, the That, I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

substantial overbreadth and only if it is a last resort

2

of the Court, not the first.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What would you -- if

4

you could do it in one sentence, what is your test for

5

determining which categories of speech are unprotected

6

by the First Amendment?

7

MR. KATYAL:

In one sentence, if -- if -- if

8

Congress sees a compelling interest in regulating the

9

means of production and does not target the underlying

10

content, they can -- they can regulate a depiction, so

11

long as it leaves alternative mechanisms for that

12

expression in -- in place, and that is I think what

13

Ferber -

14
15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

And what case -

what case do you have for that proposition?

16

MR. KATYAL:

United States v. Ferber -- New

17

York v. Ferber.

18

dealt, as modified or as glossed by your decision in

19

Free Speech Coalition, because what Ferber and Free

20

Speech Coalition together say is that Congress was

21

not -- or the legislature, was not targeting the

22

contents of a depiction; rather, it was trying to get at

23

and dry up the underlying market, child exploitation in

24

that case.

25

In Ferber, the Court -- the Court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Katyal, the Court

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

summarily dealt with a case some years ago, American

2

Booksellers v. Hudnut, where cities attempted to make

3

not even a criminal offense, but the subject of a civil

4

suit, a violent depiction -- depictions of women as

5

sexual objects enjoying pain and humiliation and

6

degradation.

7

The Seventh Circuit said that that was a

8

blatant violation of the First Amendment, to go after

9

purveyors who show these women in the shocking,

10

degrading photographs, and I believe we summarily

11

affirmed.

12

MR. KATYAL:

And this case is fundamentally

13

different from all of those because here Congress is not

14

aiming at the underlying communicative impact.

15

saying, as it was in the -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not

Well, of course it is.

I

17

mean, you can't separate the means from the end and say,

18

since its end is simply to prevent the -- the activity,

19

the means, which is to prevent the communication, is

20

okay.

21

depict this conduct.

22

It is targeting the communication of videos that

MR. KATYAL:

Quite to the contrary, Justice

23

Scalia.

The bona fides of this statute are evident

24

right on its face, because the very same depictions that

25

Mr. Stevens or anyone else swept up under the statute
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wants to portray, they can -- they can do it, so long as

2

they use simulated or images.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but to say

4

that they are not concerned with the content, I -- I

5

think is contradicted by the exceptions.

6

look at the content and make a decision, is this bona

7

fide scientific, journalistic, educational, historical?

8

So you have to look at the content to determine whether

9

or not the speech is prohibited.

10

MR. KATYAL:

You have to

I don't think so, for two

11

reasons.

12

exemptions clause in this statute was just reflecting

13

the underlying nature of the market that they saw in

14

1999, a for-profit commercial market in cruelty.

15

I think what Congress is dealing with with the

And so they exempted educational depictions,

16

religious, and so on, because that wasn't what was

17

driving the underlying market for crush videos -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How can you tell

19

these aren't political videos?

You do have, with

20

organizations, PETA and others, depictions of the same

21

sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support

22

for efforts to prohibit it.

23

exact opposite, you know, efforts to legalize it, and,

24

in each case, it would fall under the political

25

exemption?

Why aren't these videos the

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KATYAL:

And often they will fall under

2

that exemption.

My point is that Congress carved a

3

broad exemption in Section 48 precisely to make sure

4

that expressive messages aren't swept up.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you -- could you

6

tell me what the difference is between these video and

7

David Roma's documentary on pit bulls?

8

Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the

9

actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here,

10

I mean, David

greater sections of the film, and more explicit.

11

In this film, the -- the Respondent didn't

12

let the video show the actual tearing of the jaw.

David

13

Roma's did much more than that, showed much more than

14

that.

15

inherent in this statute?

So isn't -- doesn't there have to be a judgment

16

MR. KATYAL:

The line will sometimes be

17

difficult to draw, just as its difficult to draw in

18

child pornography -

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it's not in child

20

pornography because, there, Congress says the very

21

act -- it doesn't matter how artistic it is.

22

act of child pornography is illegal.

23

MR. KATYAL:

That very

Quite to the contrary, Justice

24

Sotomayor.

In this -- this Court approved, in Osborne

25

v. Ohio, a statute that's on child pornography, that had
9

the following exemption:

3

judicial, or other purpose by or to a physician,

4

psychologist, sociologist, persons pursuing bona fide

5

research studies, a judge or other persons having a

6

proper interest in the material or performance."

7

For a, quote, "bona fide

And this Court pointed to that exemptions

8

clause to make the statute constitutional at two -- at

9

two pages in that opinion.

And so this Court has

10

already gone down the path of saying these decisions are

11

tough to make on a case-by-case basis, but nonetheless

12

the legislature should have a freer hand to act when it

13

is regulating, not the expressive message, but targeting

14

the underlying content, the -- targeting the underlying

15

production, not the content.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Child -- child pornography

17

is obscenity as far as I am concerned, and it has been

18

treated as part of that same traditional classification

19

which there has always been permission for the

20

government to prohibit.

21

different.

This is something quite

22

I mean, you know, what if -- what if I -- I

23

am an aficionado of bullfights and I think, contrary to

24

the animal cruelty people, I think it -- they enoble

25

both beast and man, and I want to persuade people that
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

bullfights are terrific and we should have them.

2

I would -- I would not be able to -- to

3

market videos showing people how exciting a bullfight

4

is.

5

should really allow bullfights, but I cannot make the

6

most significant point that I want to make, get people

7

to watch it.

8
9

Right?

I would be able to talk and say, oh, you

MR. KATYAL:

I want to answer your

hypothetical, but if I could just have 20 seconds or so

10

to -- to respond more generally to all of these

11

hypotheticals which I think are going to reoccur in the

12

course of our conversation.

13

We believe that Section 48 will have

14

as-applied constitutional challenges that will be

15

inferred from case to case.

16

said is that, in your decision, Justice Scalia, in

17

United States v. Williams, is that we should be careful

18

about that endless stream of fanciful hypotheticals

19

precisely because the test under substantial

20

overbreadth, which knocks an entire act of Congress out

21

on its face, is that there must be a realistic danger

22

that the statute will be applied in -- in the manner the

23

hypothetical suggests.

24
25

But what this Court has

With respect to your bullfighting
hypothetical, there is no realistic danger.

We have had ten years of experience under the statute.

2

Congress itself said -- the legislative history, which I

3

know will not be of relevance to you but may to others

4

on the Court -- they explicitly exempted Spanish

5

bullfighting and said that is the paradigmatic case of

6

what is educational and artistic and the like.

educational, too.

are, which is my answer to Justice Sotomayor's question.

apply.

5

prosecuted.

6

And people have to understand it because they

Now, as I have gotten out of these briefs,

7

you then require people to apply that standard, not

8

simply to the crush videos or to the dogfighting, but

9

also to, as Justice Scalia pointed out, bullfighting,

10

sheep hunting, bear hunting, deer hunting, fox hunting,

11

humane slaughter, and for, I think somewhere I found,

the stuffing geese for pate de fois gras.

that child pornography arrived in my -- in the mail and

9

it doesn't -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

No, but hunting with a bow

12

are pretty gruesome.

13

MR. KATYAL:

That's correct.

And to the

14

extent that it is something that resembles the terms of

15

the statute, the language of which is "maimed,

16

mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed" -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"Or killed."

How do you

18

limit "killed" to cruel -- you say in your brief that

17
Alderson Reporting Company

So if you speak of

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

various meanings.

2

"Kill" has one meaning, which is kill.

And

3

you can -- you cannot limit that meaning just because in

4

addition to killing you also prohibit torturing and

5

other things.

6

that doctrine is used not to give meaning to an

7

ambiguous word, but to limit the meaning of a word which

8

on its face is absolutely clear?

9

Do you have a single case where -- where

MR. KATYAL:

Yes, sir, Your Honor.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. KATYAL:

I do.

What is that?

That is the decision you wrote

12

last year in United States v. Williams, which interprets

13

the words "promotes and presents," which you yourself in

14

the opinion said are capable of a wide variety of

15

meanings.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. KATYAL:

Exactly.

And -- and here the word "kill"

18

in context is a term that the statute -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

No, it's not susceptible to

a wide -- that's my whole point.
MR. KATYAL:

It means kill.

It means killed in the context

22

of a statute that is defining the words "animal

23

cruelty," and this Court has consistently said that the

24

definition that is being defined by the legislature -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Some people think eating an

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

animal is animal cruelty.

2

because it is the product of killing animals.

3

MR. KATYAL:

These people don't eat meat

And the legislature under no

4

way, shape, or form was targeting that.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Well, it shouldn't have

said that, then.

7

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think that it basically

8

did say that by using the words "animal cruelty" in the

9

statute.

10

Now, if there's a disagreement about that JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't have a single

11

case in which a -- an absolutely clear word like "kill"

12

is given a more narrow meaning because of other words

13

that are different from that word.

14

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Scalia, in Leocal, this

15

Court defined the term "crime of violence," which the

16

INA had -- that the INA interpreted wrongly.

17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you want to say "cruelly

kill"?

19

MR. KATYAL:

That's -

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, "cruelly kill" is not

21

exactly crystal clear.

And therefore my question is

22

why, given the need for you to save this statute to read

23

so many words that are so general, those contained here

24

that I've read, cruelly kill, cruelly wound as opposed

25

to just wound or kill.

You are doing that in order to
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prevent chilling people who are engaging in activities

2

that aren't intended to be covered by this statute.

3

Why not do a simpler thing?

Rather than let

4

the public guess as to what these words mean, ask

5

Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those

6

frightful things that it was trying to prohibit.

7

that can be done.

8
9

I don't know why they couldn't do it.

MR. KATYAL:
Williams.

Now,

And it could have been done in

It could have been done in the child

10

pornography cases, which also have vague terms.

11

what this Court has said is that using the substantial

12

overbreadth doctrine to do that leaves gaping holes in

13

place.

14

we would leave crush videos unprotected.

15

But

If we followed your invitation, Justice Breyer,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

Why?

You say a crush

16

video, my description that I read of it, you would have

17

a strong case.

18

have to decide that.

19

So you say to Congress, write a statute that focuses on

20

that.

21

statute that focuses on that, and moreover, talks about

22

reduced the market for muggings or something like that.

The abuse of the dog and the promotion of the fight is

separate from the filming of it.

a -- that a properly drawn law could very well, at least

in my humble opinion, this Court would have to decide,

10

There is also, I suppose, some argument

whether it would fit into -- you wouldn't need strict

think this could pass constitutional muster.

that says the patently offensive intentional torture and

problems.

not that specific instance could be prohibited under a

could prohibit the conduct, the speech broadcast in that

At the time that the First Amendment was written

I guess is when you say yes to this, what you are

instinct of lust, so Congress could find a category of

that happens is to look at the text and say, does this

text fit the purpose, does it fit what the Constitution

will allow?

And when the JUSTICE ALITO:

If it's the fact that during

the ten years when this statute has been in effect there

10

has been no decrease in hunting videos and hunting shows

change in the real world is that these -- is that the

market for crush videos dried up, at least until the

it wants to -- to apply overbreadth, it has been dealing

with situations for the most part in two contexts.

where Congress has already regulated in an area that is

13

unprotected under the First Amendment, unprotected in

the sense that they are allowed to ban, regulate

15

heavily.

16

did they draw the margins too broad?

for purposes of creating the image.

In so far as you are trying to make an

argument or educate, of course, it is protected, but the

government, here, is saying I think the statute is

intended to forbid a different thing entirely, and it's

hard to draw a line.

10

Maybe it's impossible; but promoting a thing

which communicates nothing, but appeals to people's

If you have got -

argument -- the Ferber argument is off the table.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. KATYAL:

There is one analytic move

15

Congress made in Section 48, which is simple and

obvious, and it explains why both the human sacrifice

channel is constitutional, as well as Section 48 itself.

18

That is the logic of Ferber.

When Congress

19

tries to dry up a market for underlying cruelty by

20

targeting depictions and leaves alternative mechanisms

21

for that expression in place, the legislature has

22

latitude.

23

When the statute is not aimed at the

24

communicative impact of the message, like the Hitler

25

video, but, rather, is aimed at reducing underlying acts

you saying, since there is no human sacrifice in this

identified a market and if a video -- if the snuff video

could not proscribe the human sacrifice channel.

14

Nobody's doing that stuff.

MR. KATYAL:

So you

That's precisely correct, but,

15

here, Congress did find an overwhelming market in animal

16

cruelty, and the State attorney's general that filed a

17

brief before you saying that Section 48 is a success

18

story, that it dried up 3,000 crush videos, that it has

19

reduced the market for animal -

20
21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How many prosecutions

have there been for crush videos?
MR. KATYAL:

There -- there haven't been any

23

prosecutions for crush videos, and I think the reason is

24

because the market dried up very quickly after the

25

enactment of Section 48.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did I just

2

understand you to agree with your colleague on the other

3

side, that Congress could not ban the human sacrifice

4

channel because there would be no connection between

5

drying up the underlying activity?

6

MR. KATYAL:

7

10

If there is an

underlying argument -

8
9

Oh, no.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
is no connection.

No. I'm saying there

We can't reach the activity where it

is taking place.

11

MR. KATYAL:

I think that does start to

12

reach into questions about obscenity and expressive

13

impact on viewers, which is not before this Court.

14

Congress is not resting its judgment here on something

15

saying these images are repulsive and can't be seen.

16

Rather, it is saying -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

and we will give you sufficient rebuttal time.

19

So if Congress is -

So, if Congress is saying, Look, we just

20

don't like what -- is being shown on the human sacrifice

21

channel, we don't want people to see it, they can't do

22

that?

23

MR. KATYAL:

Again, that raises a whole

24

different set of questions under obscenity and

25

expressive impact that isn't before the Court here.

Now, if I could return to, Justice Stevens,

2

you had he wasn't clear on the position on hunting.

3

want to be very clear on this.

4

I

Hunting, like the other hypotheticals, is

5

not covered by section 48 for two reasons:

6

statute -- the statute's term "animal cruelty" should be

7

defined to encompass torture, mutilation and the like,

8

and not simple acts of ordinary hunting, most of which,

9

by the way, are legal anyway under animal cruelty.

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. KATAYAL:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

How about the statute's

term, "kill" -

12

14

First, the

And again -- what should that be

interpreted to mean?
MR. KATYAL:

And again, Justice Scalia, as I

16

said before, I think that comes within a definition of

17

animal cruelty.

18

just as this Court has defined, for example, crimes of

19

violence to exclude certain things that otherwise would

20

be within the statute, such as drunk driving offenses in

21

the context of the IMA, a similar result is possible

22

here, particularly because of the doctrine of

23

constitutional avoidance.

24
25

That's the term being defined.

And

And, so, we are saying that if this Court
were to write an opinion that made clear that these
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

things are outside of the purview of section 48, there

2

would be no chilling effect, and you wouldn't have to -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Wait, I want to just be

4

sure I understand you.

5

very offensive and cruel and all the rest, and that the

6

cruelty to the animal using bow and arrows or knives or

7

something, you say it's not -- and even if it's illegal

8

in this particular jurisdiction, you say the statute

9

still does not apply at all?

10

Even if the hunting depiction is

MR. KATYAL:

It would have to be for a

11

reason of animal cruelty or something like torture,

12

mutilation and the like.

13

hunting examples that fall within it -

14

So there may be certain

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the hunting would

15

never qualify, because the hunter's motive is benign; is

16

that what you are saying?

17

MR. KATYAL:

No, it has nothing to do with

18

the motive, it has to do with what happens to the

19

animal.

20

are not really hunting, like the images in this case.

21

And, so, there could be images of hunting which

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you shoot a little low

22

and wound the animal, that is cruelty even though you

23

didn't intend that.

24
25

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Scalia, with all due

respect, I think the images in this case and what
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress was getting at was not shooting a little low.

2

These are the most horrific images that you can imagine

3

of cruelty to living animals.

4

Congress -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's what

But what about your

6

response to Justice Stevens on the hunting matter?

7

understand Congress wasn't directed at -

8
9

MR. KATYAL:

I

And my point if those -- if

there are those cases at the area -- at the gray areas,

10

that is perfect for as applied challenge, but it's not

11

what this Court -- this Court shouldn't be blessing the

12

Third Circuit's decision to in toto invalidate an entire

13

statute which has produced -- which has produced 3,000

14

crush videos and the like.
