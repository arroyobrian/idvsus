ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

To accommodate important pretrial

11

proceedings, the Speedy Trial Act contains several

12

automatic exclusions from its deadline for commencing

13

trial.

14

motions, which excludes the period of delay resulting

15

from any pretrial motion from the filing of the motion

16

through the conclusion of the hearing on or other prompt

17

disposition of such motion.

18

This case concerns the exclusion for pretrial

For more than 30 years, the courts of

19

appeals had uniformly held that the exclusion applies

20

automatically upon the filing of any motion, regardless

21

of its effect on the trial schedule.

22

correctly rejected that established rule, which accords

23

with this Court's decisions, is clear and easy to

24

administer, and has worked well for over 3 decades.

25

The court below

The Court's cases construing the exclusion,
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Henderson and Bloate, support the established rule.

2

They make clear that the exclusion applies automatically

3

once a motion is filed without any need for district

4

court findings.

5

with the approach of Respondent and the court below.

6

Henderson and Bloate cannot be squared

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, all that might

7

be true.

On the other hand, the statute does say "delay

8

resulting."

9

excluded even if delay does not result.

10

And under your approach, the time would be

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

Delay refers

11

to the interval of time from the filing of the motion

12

through its disposition, during which the Speedy Trial

13

Act's deadline is tolled.

14

meaning -- delay can often have the meaning of the

15

interval of time between two events.

16

We know that delay has the

And we know it has that meaning in the

17

statute here because subsection (D) tells us so.

18

defines the period of excludable delay resulting from

19

the motion as the time from the filing through the

20

disposition of the motion.

21

It

Respondent's definition -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the Chief Justice says

22

only if it -- it's really a circular argument -- only if

23

it results in a delay.

24

in a delay?

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, suppose it doesn't result

That's assuming that delay is
4


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

referring to delay of the trial, to a postponement in

2

the trial.

3

it has that -- if that meaning is inconsistent with

4

subsection (D) of the statute's exclusion of the time,

5

of saying that delay is the time from the filing of the

6

motion through the disposition of the motion, because

7

the statute excludes periods of delay.

8
9

But delay can't have that meaning because if

And if delay meant postponement of the
trial, then the excluded period would be the time during

10

which trial is postponed, but that period is often

11

significantly shorter or longer than the time from the

12

filing of the motion to the disposition.

13

Henderson and Bloate -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in

But that doesn't -- that

15

prove the point that I think is the concern of the Chief

16

Justice's question, that in some cases the delay -

17

there's a delay that results and in other cases there

18

isn't.

19

MR. ROBERTS:

But, Your Honor, the statute

20

excludes the period of delay, and then it says the

21

period of delay is the time from the filing through the

22

disposition.

23

the trial, then all that's excluded by the statute in

24

the first part is the -- is the time during which trial

25

is postponed, but that doesn't match up with subsection

If delay -- if delay means postponement of

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(D) because that period is not necessarily the period

2

from the filing through the disposition.

3

If I could give you an example.

Say a

4

motion is filed 14 days before trial could begin, and

5

the motion takes 16 days to resolve.

6

only by two days.

7

postponement of trial, then the period of delay should

8

be 2 days, but the statute says that the delay and the

9

excludable time is the time from the filing through the

10
11

Trial is postponed

And so if delay means the

disposition, which is 16 days.
And that's what this Court held in Henderson

12

and Bloate, that that's the exact time.

13

a definition of delay for the first part as a triggering

14

mechanism that's the postponement of trial, that doesn't

15

line up with the rest of the statute.

16

So if you adopt

In addition, that would be a totally

17

unworkable rule because whether time is excludable would

18

turn on a complex and often uncertain analysis of

19

whether the motion would or could delay when trial would

20

begin, and it's often going to be difficult or

21

impossible to make that determination at the time that

22

the motion is filed.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Roberts, is there -

24

is there any, anything to indicate that what Congress

25

might have had in mind is that in criminal cases
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

inevitably there are going to be motions, and so the

2

trial judge is likely to set the trial date for after

3

that period runs?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.

Sometimes

5

trial -- judges might take motions into account in

6

setting the trial date and other times they might not

7

take the motions into account.

8

said the exclusion only applies if the judge moves the

9

trial date in response to the motion would lead to

10

So a rule that -- that

arbitrary results.

11

It would mean basically that whether time

12

was excludable depended on whether the judge took the

13

motions into account when it set the trial date

14

initially or whether the, whether the judge correctly

15

estimated the amount of time.

16

motions may be filed when no trial date is set, so the

17

rule would be totally unworkable in that situation.

18

And also sometimes

And Respondent, in one of his formulations

19

for what the test might be, suggests that a motion

20

wouldn't create excludable delay unless it would

21

postpone the hypothetical earliest date on which trial

22

could otherwise begin.

23

rule, because to divine that hypothetical date, courts

24

would have to assess the effect of multiple different

25

factors that could affect when trial would begin, such

That's just a totally unworkable

Alderson Reporting Company

1

as:

How much time do the parties and the counsel need

2

for factual investigation and legal analysis?

3

is discovery going to take?

4

How long

There would be numerous questions that would

5

arise about how to apply those factors.

6

the courts would have to decide:

7

potential obstacles to an earlier trial as given, or

8

should they instead think about whether those obstacles

9

could be eliminated?

For example,

Should they take

The courts would also have to

10

figure out what to do if the earliest possible trial

11

date changed between when the motion was filed and when

12

the motion was resolved.

13

account other periods of time that might exclude

14

delay -- might exclude -- that might be excludable also?

15

And how would they take into

For example, say a court gets two motions

16

filed at the same time.

resolve; the other motion's going to take 4 days to

depend on the order in which the court decides them?

23

just is not possible for a court to make these

24

determinations.

What's the court supposed to do?

Is one -- is

Are both of the motions excluded?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does it

You said at the outset

8

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that things have been working fine.

2

whole point of the Act was to hold district judges to a

3

pretty strict standard, and the concern is that there

4

might be a very complex case the judge just really wants

5

to put off as long as possible and will continue to

6

accept motion after motion.

7

I can read or consult to show that this has been working

8

very well and that there's not a problem?

9

MR. ROBERTS:

Of course, the

Is there anything I can -

Well, I -- I can't point to

10

anything particular, but there's been no outcry that -

11

that there's been a problem from pretrial motions being

Act deadline.

14

15

It made changes in 1979 to address problems that have

16

occurred.

17

problem since, and there's no evidence of any abuse of

18

the automatic exclusion on the other side.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The court's been -- the -- Congress has

It hasn't felt the need to address this

Counsel, on that issue,

20

do you accept the First Circuit's rule in U.S. v. Hood

21

that if the government is found to be attempting to

22

frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act, that

23

those motions and their delays won't be counted?

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, first, Your Honor, I

don't think that -- that Hood adopted any such rule.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

It suggests that there might

be that qualification.

provides that the -- that any pretrial motion tolls the

deadline, regardless of the purpose for which it's

8

filed.

9

a prosecutor did file a motion solely to extend the

I think that the statute

But, of course, if -- in the unlikely event that

10

deadline and avoid proceeding to trial, that conduct

11

would be sanctionable under -- under the Act, under

section 3162(b)(4).

Sanctionable against the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How does that help a

defendant whose speedy trial rights have been violated?

19

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the -- the court doesn't

20

need to put off trial just because time is excluded,

21

Your Honor, and the court has other mechanisms that it

22

can use -

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You haven't answered my

24

question.

The rights that this statute protects are the

25

rights to have your trial start within 70 days absent or
10

Alderson Reporting Company

extended to these exclusions.

2

frustrates that and makes the trial start later, why

3

shouldn't a defendant have the benefit of the Act and

4

have the indictment dismissed with or without prejudice?

5

MR. ROBERTS:

If the government

Well, the statute provides the

6

circumstances in which time is excludable and in which

7

time is not, and it doesn't create an exception for

8

certain kinds of motions.

9

motion.

It applies to any pretrial

But I have to say, there's been no evidence

10

over the 30 years that anything like this is happening,

11

and in Hood itself, the motion was filed by defense

12

counsel, and the court was simply saying that this is

13

not -- that that's not what's going on here, there's no

14

suggestion that this motion is part of a process to try

15

to frustrate the Act.

16

hasn't arisen.

17

There's -- the problem just

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I hope you

18

won't sit down without addressing the (h)(1)(F) issue

19

and explain why we shouldn't reach it, because the issue

20

is, as I see it, one of law, not like Nobles, one of

21

discretion.

22

because of a change in Rule 45, how could any criminal

23

conviction that's inappropriate be unimportant to the

24

defendant or insignificant enough for this Court to

25

address the question once the case is before us?

And although you say it's unimportant

11

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the Court -- the Court

does decline to address questions if it doesn't consider

3

them of sufficient importance to -- general importance

to warrant a review.

others cited in Stern and Gressman.

this issue is not of any ongoing importance is that the

Nobles is one example.

There are

But the reason that

It now expressly applies to

And, you know, turning to the merits of the

The circuits all have adopted the same approach as the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Two?

circuits are we talking about?
MR. ROBERTS:

Two other circuits, but there

aren't any that have -- that have held to the contrary.
JUSTICE ALITO:

If we were to decide this

19

based on subsection (F) involving the counting of 10

20

days, wouldn't that render our decision on anything that

21

we had to say about subsection (D) dictum?

22

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think it would render

23

it dictum, Your Honor.

The Court can address issues

24

in -- in whatever order it chooses to, and it doesn't

25

mean that the -- the decisions that you make along the
12

the rationale to get there.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we would -- we don't

It's not part of the

rationale.

6

(h)(1)(D) alone, and all the other discussion would be

perfectly gratuitous, because we're going to set this

individual free anyway.

The rationale for our decision would be

To say, well, this other thing

10

I mean, that -- the former is just utterly irrelevant to

11

our decision.

12

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, Your Honor, the

13

Respondent offered this argument as a ground not to

14

grant certiorari in its -- in his brief in opposition.

22

if you think so and you think that that's a reason -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm sure it's not

Mr. Roberts, as you pointed out, it's not a continuing

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is -- is it right that the

-- for -- for Rule 45, yes.
And now you think that the

Federal courts are right in saying, judge, when you have

that's right to do?

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, we do.

We think that

they -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So why shouldn't

4

this defendant whose case was on appeal get the

5

advantage of that?

6

MR. ROBERTS:

Because at the time, that

7

wasn't -- at the time that -- that the transportation

8

was done then -

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know it was under a

10

different rule.

11

you have a new rule come in, it does apply to the

12

advantage of the people who were then on appeal.

13

there something special about this, that Federal rules

14

don't, or you just -- too bad, we thought it was a

15

really erroneous thing that they had, we used to have,

16

and we've corrected it, but just -- he's still on

appeal, it doesn't apply to him?

that?

dictated the transportation for him, and -

advantage of the new rule?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

Why shouldn't he get the

Because it's not -- it's not a

4

-- a rule of law that we're talking about.

It's the

5

counting of the time, and it's impossible for a court to

6

anticipate -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

It wasn't anybody's fault.

9

You want to -

Why shouldn't we go back and say do it again, and now,

10

let's -- since his case is still on appeal, it's the

11

same question.

12

Why can't we?

13

What's the argument against doing that?

I'm sure there's some rule out there that

14

says we can't do this, but I want to know what it is

15

because it seems fair.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

May I suggest that perhaps

17

the reason not to do it is, assuming this person was

18

treated entirely fairly on the basis of the law that

19

existed at the time, the consequence of what Justice

20

Breyer proposes is to set free someone who has been duly

21

convicted of a crime.

22

MR. ROBERTS:

That's right.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And to do that simply

24

because, although the -- the process was perfectly fair

25

when it was applied, there's been a change in the rule
18

go; right?

Any other reason?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I think you don't.
Will you like the way

10

we're going if I accept your proposition that when

11

Congress uses 10 days, it really means 10 business days?

12

I take words in a statute like that at their plain

13

meaning.

14

It says 10 days, not 10 business days.
MR. ROBERTS:

So -

Well, Your Honor, I think that

15

there's no plain meaning.

16

business days; they can sometimes mean calendar days,

17

and as I said before -

18

"Days" sometimes can mean

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's go back to -- I

2

don't think you should have been so happy with the way

3

the argument was going -

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- because -- because

6

your view is, Rule 40 -- if it's always assumed that

7

there be conformity between Rule 45 -- Rule 45, it was

8

business days, and then rule 45 changed not only to say

9

calendar days, but included statutes for the first time.

10

So I think what you're saying is that the

11

interpretation of the statute tracks with Rule 45, Rule

12

45 formerly was calendar -- was business days, it is now

13

calendar days, there is conformity.

14

is in Rule 45, and that was at least laid on the table

15

of Congress, so they know that it was there.

16

MR. ROBERTS:

And plus, "statute"

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that

17

-- that the statute always meant the same thing, and

18

that it meant that 10 days should be interpreted in

19

light of whatever the background rule is at the time for

counting the time.

rule; at the time the 10 days meant exclude the weekends

22

and holidays, and now because the background rule has

changed, it means count the weekends, and -

Where in the statute

does it -- say, apply the criminal rules?
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think that -- that my

10

point is that when it doesn't specify whether it's

11

business or calendar days, that Congress anticipated the

12

courts would say, okay, let's look to the background

13

rule; and the place, the sensible place to look to the

14

background rule is the rule -- is a rule of criminal

15

procedure in analogous contexts.

16

In fact, courts frequently do that when

17

they're trying to interpret statutes to figure out what

18

the 10-day limit is/ as many of the -- many of the cases

19

cited in the ALR article that Respondent cites show.

JUSTICE ALITO:

When you're trying -- when

you're trying to figure out -- when you're dealing with

20

not to address this issue, which is of no ongoing

importance, that the question that we did ask the Court

to address and that the Court granted review on is a

23

very important question that's divided the circuits; and

that allowing the rule that the court below adopted to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

14

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Before turning to the substance, I would

15

like to, if I may, start with the procedural question

16

that Justice Sotomayor raised and that -- and that my

17

opponent just completed with, because I want to be sure

18

there's no confusion on the posture of this case.

19

In particular, this Court's precedents

20

squarely reject the notion that there's any history in

21

this Court's precedents for refusing to reach an

22

argument in this posture.

23

Green, 282 U.S. 531, this Court held in 1931 that a

24

Respondent's, quote, "right" to defend a judgment below

25

on a ground that is properly preserved all along and

In particular, in Langness v.

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the lower court reached and rejected is, quote,

2

"beyond successful challenge."

3
4

Now, I'm not sure -- I'm not aware of any
exception from that rule in the 80 years since.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose the petition here

6

had simply raised one question, and that is the question

7

of how you count time under -- under a version of Rule

8

45 of the Federal Rules Of Criminal Procedure that is

9

not -- no longer in effect and as to which there is no

10

conflict in the circuits.

11

chances of the Court taking cert on that?

12

MR. FISHER:

How would you grade the

Well, I'll take your

13

hypothetical, Justice Alito, but I do want to be able to

14

correct the notion that it's of no longer continuing

15

importance.

16

that kind of a question would be cert denied.

17

that's never been an obstacle to reaching the question.

18

But I'll assume that your hypothetical on
But

Let me give you two things that are very

19

important here.

The first is the problem with the

20

Government's citation to Nobles is not just a

21

distinction between discretion and law.

22

the Solicitor General's own reply brief in that case, it

23

pointed out that the problem with the alternative

24

argument there was that it would give the defendant

25

different relief.

If you look at

So it was therefore subject to the
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cross-petitions rule, and that's the section in Stern

2

and Gressman that's cited in their brief.

3

only two citations they have, the citations to Nobles

4

and the citations to Stern and Gressman, which are all

5

about cross-petitions when the defendant wants different

6

relief.

7

dismissal on the Speedy Trial Act.

8
9

We want exactly the same relief.

Those are the

We want a

So finally, even if it were somehow
discretionary and this Court were to consider in this

10

case breaking from its unbroken precedent of 80 years -

11

let me give you one more example before I turn to the

12

discretionary.

13

In the Walling case in 1947, this Court

14

reached as an alternative ground the defendant's

15

argument that there was insufficient evidence.

16

that's sort of the quintessential un-cert-worthy

17

question, but this Court felt required to reach it

18

because the lower court had reached it and rejected it

19

and the defendant had preserved it all along in that

20

case.

21

Now,

And in the Union Pacific case in 2009 -- I

22

can keep giving you citations.

But let me just say,

23

even if it were discretionary, you would still want to

24

reach it in this case, because at pages 18 and 19 of the

25

Solicitor General's brief there are citations to a
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

circuit split on this issue.

2

made that go away for two reasons.

3

And the new Rule 45 hasn't

The first is because the Solicitor General's

4

own argument now doesn't depend on Rule 45.

5

it's that the Speedy Trial Act on its own terms counts

6

10 business days, not simply calendar days.

7

second, there continue to be decisions after the

8

amendment of Rule 45 in which lower courts have said

9

that this provision means only 10 business days.

10

Instead,

And,

Let me give you one more citation, and

11

forgive me for this because we didn't get to file a

12

reply brief in this case on this issue.

13

case, 2010 Westlaw, 307-5044, is a case in the Eastern

14

District of Michigan last summer where the Government's

15

own filing, which we looked at on PACER, asked the court

16

to apply Tinklenberg and hold that subsection (F) meant

17

only ten business days.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the Zabawa

If I could just come back to

19

where you started before you go on to these additional

20

points.

21

petitions for cert on one issue that's a legal issue on

22

which there's a conflict in the circuits and the

23

Respondent in a criminal case says that the -- asks to

24

have the decision below affirmed on 15 other grounds, we

25

-- and raises those in the bio, we take the case anyway,

Your argument is that if the Government

28

Alderson Reporting Company

1

we are duty-bound to decide every one of those 15

2

grounds?

3

MR. FISHER:

You're not duty-bound to decide

4

it, Justice Alito.

But I do think under this Court's

5

precedent, at least, you have never reversed the

6

decision below without reaching them.

7

8

those questions.

So you may well

You may also dismiss the case as

circumstances.

11

happen is when the cert -- when the ops was filed this

12

Court would realize there was a serious obstacle to

13

reaching the question and might well deny cert in the

14

first place.

15

Court's books and certainly the Solicitor General hasn't

16

appointed one where you've reversed and reinstated a

17

conviction or, in fact, reversed and done anything to a

18

Respondent in these circumstances.

19

Of course, what ordinarily what would

But as I said, there's no decision on this

Now, let me turn to the merits of the ten

20

day argument and make a few points before I'm sure the

21

Court might want to talk about the pretrial motions

22

issue as well.

23

Now, remember, the Solicitor General has now basically

24

abandoned the Sixth Circuit's view that Rule 45

25

automatically gets incorporated into the Speedy Trial

There's a few important points to make.

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Act and now they're making the making the argument that

2

what Congress intended in the Speedy Trial Act was

3

somehow for Rule 45 to operate as some background

4

principle.

5

would wax and wane according to what Rule 45 said.

6

there's two versions of this argument.

7

which it's making.

8

Congress meant when it passed subsection F in 1979 was

9

that whatever the rule is in Rule 45 right now, that's

So that the meaning of the Act, I guess,
Now,

I can't tell

First it could be saying that what

what we expect to be applied.

be the Solicitor General's argument because in 1979 Rule

12

45, consistent with the traditional rule, excluded

13

weekends and holidays only for periods of less than

14

seven days.

15

Congress at the time, even if they had cared about Rule

16

45, wouldn't have, wouldn't have thought you counted,

17

excluded weekends and holidays here.

Why wouldn't Congress

should be interpreted into the Federal rule, that Rule

22

23

MR. FISHER:

I think the much more natural

24

reading, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the traditional

25

rule, which is not just cited in Am. Jur., please
30

understanding because when Congress wanted, such as in

from a ten day period, it expressly says so.

18

much more natural inference its that when Congress

wanted to exclude weekends and holidays consistent with

20

the traditional rule, it felt duty bound to say so in

the U.S. Code, and when it hasn't, it wants simply

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're not relying on the

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The first is that

No.
You don't say -- you say

this was wrong when it was decided?

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. FISHER:

Yes.
Regardless of the 2009?

That's right, that's right.

13

But if you want to talk about Congressional intent, I

14

don't think we have to even go there.

15

after the -- in 2009 there's also a Federal law, the

16

Technical Amendments Statutory Act made a hash of that.

17

But Congress went through, most recently about a year

18

and a half ago, and amended various provisions of the

19

U.S. Code according to whether it wanted weekends or

20

holidays excluded or times enlarged, and it left this

21

alone.

22

look at from every possible angle shows that ten days

23

meant ten days at the time of the trial, and that's not

to affirm the judgment.

So I think every indicia of evidence you can

The last point I'll make concerning -
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Congress thought about the

2

Speedy Trial Act when it made those technical

3

amendments, isn't it likely to have thought the courts

4

had interpreted it as excluding the weekends up to that

5

point?

6

MR. FISHER:

No, my point, Justice Alito, is

7

Congress didn't think of the Speedy Trial Act, it didn't

8

do anything with the Speedy Trial Act.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

MR. FISHER:

Didn't think about -- okay.

Well, maybe we leave that where

11

it was, but let me make one final point that I think is

12

the clincher here.

13

alternative argument, we have a second alternative

14

argument, which is that the time in relation to Mr.

15

Tinklenberg's competency hearing exceeded the 30 day

16

provision in section 4247 in the Insanity Defense Reform

17

Act.

18

argument, you can simply affirm on the ten day issue,

19

but, again, let's think about what the Solicitor General

20

is arguing with respect to the ten day issue.

21

saying that Congress sub silentio, without saying

22

anything at all in the Speedy Trial Act, somehow assumed

23

that the time in subsection F would wax and wane

24

according to this rule.

25

the rule didn't even apply to statutes at the time.

Remember, we have not just this

Now, I don't think you have to get to that

They're

Well, if that's -- even though

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Well, if that's the case, then I don't think there's any

2

basis for arguing that Congress would have had exactly

3

the same assumption with respect to another Federal

4

statute, that is the Insanity Defense Reform Act.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if we don't

6

agree with you on your Rule 45 argument, you say we

7

would have to reach this third argument, right?

8
9

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

So I think the only

way -- somehow, you've accepted the Solicitor General's

10

argument, which I don't think you can, but if you did

11

accept it on merits, it runs headlong into our third

12

argument, which the Solicitor General takes exactly the

13

opposite position, which is, the Speedy Trial Act is its

14

own self-contained universe that doesn't incorporate any

15

other statutes or any other provisions of law.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why aren't they

17

trying -- why isn't the effect of what you're doing to

18

prompt us to dismiss this case that the petitioner has

19

improvidently granted?

20

that says that the -- the Sixth Circuit was wrong in its

21

interpretation of subsection (f), and therefore, we're

22

not going to get to -- and anything we then had to say

23

about subsection (d) is just dictum, and that's the

24

issue that we took the case to decide, why should we

24

where the text dictates the outcome of the case.

25

Remember, the key words in the statute are "delay
35

Alderson Reporting Company

2

meaning, in fact, the only meaning, of "delay" is a

3

hindrance to progress or a postponement.

So it's -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry to

5

interrupt you so early, but what about Justice

6

Ginsburg's point, which I understood to be there's

7

always delay resulting from these pretrial motions; it's

8

just that the district judge takes that into account,

9

says, well, I'm going to have a lot of the usual

10

pretrial motions, so I'm going to set the trial date at

11

this point.

12

So that is delay, when the trial date might

13

otherwise have been set, resulting from these pretrial

14

motions, and then the -- the statute goes on to tell you

15

how you count that delay.

16

MR. FISHER:

That's exactly our argument,

17

Mr. Chief Justice.

Our argument is there's two ways you

18

can have delay:

19

moved to accommodate the motion.

20

is where we agree with what the Solicitor General said

21

here today, as well as at page 38-39 of his opening

22

brief -- delay can also, in the ordinary English

23

language, mean that the trial date was originally set to

24

accommodate the motions in the way you just described.

25

But what the Solicitor General is arguing for is

One is by the trial date simply being
The other -- and this

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

something much more dramatic than that.

2

arguing for an exclusion of the time, even if trial date

3

was set irregardless of the motions -

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They are

How would you ever know

5

that?

6

judge that has had a lot of criminal cases knows that

7

there's going to be some motions as you get closer to

8

trial, but how would we know whether the judge -- this

9

particular judge took into account the likelihood of

10

How would we ever know that, Mr. Fisher?

A trial

motions in setting the trial date or didn't?

11

MR. FISHER:

Well, ordinarily, Justice

12

Ginsburg -- remember, this is only a small subset of

13

cases.

14

the trial judge would say on the record when the date is

15

set.

16

there's any date that's ever set, the NACDL brief, I

17

think, explains how that works in the district in the

18

Sixth Circuit right now.

19

asked to stipulate by the court.

20

long way in this scenario, Justice Ginsburg.

21

obvious.

22
23

But in those cases, ordinarily, I would think

Now, if it's -- if there's motion practice before

Parties often stipulate or are

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Common sense goes a
It's

Why -- why would the

defendant stipulate?

24

MR. FISHER:

Pardon me?

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why would -- why would a

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defendant who would benefit from the clock running

2

stipulate?

3

MR. FISHER:

Defendants don't always benefit

4

from the clock running, Justice Ginsburg.

5

there's two reasons why they might stipulate.

6

because it might simply be obvious that the motion is of

7

sufficient weight and difficulty that it's going to

8

consume the court's resources, so why argue something

9

that wouldn't have a basis to begin with?

10

I think
One is

But I think the NACDL brief is forthright in

11

saying, at least at the beginning of criminal cases,

12

often defendants find themselves wanting more time, and

13

so, again, they don't have the incentive to argue

14

against that.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

How do you reconcile your

16

argument with the situation in which the motion is

17

pending for 30 days, so that's the period from the

18

filing until the prompt disposition, and as a result of

19

that motion, the trial judge says this has caused -

20

this is going to force me, this is going to result in 10

21

days' delay in the date on which the case can begin, so

22

the trial date is pushed back 10 days?

23

situation, how much time is excluded?

24
25

MR. FISHER:

Now, in that

I think the -- the text of the

statute allows you to say either 30 or 10.
38

Alderson Reporting Company

I think in

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

light of this Court's Henderson decision -- and perhaps

2

I think Congress had administrability concerns in mind

3

with that last clause -- I think 30 days could be

4

excluded.

5

want to have a rigid textual reading of the statute

6

resulting from only meaning 10 days, I think that's your

7

only other option.

8

But if you disagree with me on that and you

Because, if I could ask the Court, or at

9

least direct the Court to page 6 of the Solicitor

10

General's reply brief, this is where they give -

11

because I think what the government wants to do is pose

12

these difficult hypotheticals, and the sort of difficult

13

question you just raised, Justice Alito, and have this

14

Court respond by saying, oh, we're just going to throw

15

the words "delay resulting from" out of the statute.

16

Because there's only two definitions, two ways to deal

17

with what the Solicitor General offers.

18

First, they say that delay means time, and I

19

think ordinary -- in ordinary English language, "delay"

20

means something more than time.

21

So then the fallback argument -- this is the second

22

paragraph on page 6 -- is that the occurrence that is

23

postponed is the STA's deadline for commencing trial,

24

and our suggestion is that that begs the whole question.

25

That can't possibly be right, because the whole reason

It means postponement.

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that you're looking to subsection (d) to apply it is to

2

ask whether you should exclude the time.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me, but isn't

4

that what the statute says?

5

(h), the beginning paragraph at (h), it says, "The

6

following periods of delay shall be excluded in

7

computing the time within which the trial of any such

8

offense must commence."

9

Meaning, if you look at

It's not talking about the delay of the

10

trial.

11

date for the trial.

12

to do, doesn't -- isn't only the Solicitor General's

13

position consistent with that?

14

the periods of delay and compute the date the trial must

15

start by excluding those.

16

It's talking about the computation of the start
So if that's what that commands you

MR. FISHER:

It's telling you to take

That's the language.
I think for two reasons, I

17

would disagree, respectfully, Justice Sotomayor.

First

18

is, I take that language to say that we're going to now

19

tell you all the circumstances under which you exclude

20

time, and so if any of these subsections are satisfied,

21

you exclude the time.

But the -

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's the -

23

MR. FISHER:

24

is that you start from the premise.

25

from" means you've already excluded the time.

-- Solicitor General's argument

40

Alderson Reporting Company

"Delay resulting
That's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the premise.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but that's what

3

(h) says; (h) says you compute the start date of the

4

trial, when it must start, by excluding all of these

5

periods of delay.

6

It's defining it for you.

MR. FISHER:

Well, if -- if there was delay.

7

Maybe another example, Justice Sotomayor.

In

8

subsection 7, which is at (4)(a) of the government's

9

appendix, I think is another way of showing that it

10

can't possibly -- even if it weren't begging the

11

question, it can't possibly be right.

12

talking about the trial itself, because this is the

13

continuance -- the end of the justice continuance

14

section.

15

from a continuance granted by a judge on his own

16

motion," and blah, blah, blah, "if certain criteria are

17

met."

18

It has to be

And it says, "Any period of delay resulting

Now, it's very clear that in that section,

19

"period" -- "period of delay resulting from" can't mean

20

that we've already said that the clock is stopped,

21

because there's an "if" clause that gives you certain

22

things that have to be satisfied in order to exclude it.

23

So I think starting with the very title of the Act we're

24

talking about, the Speedy Trial Act, and the -- the idea

25

of the words "delay resulting from" can only sensibly
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mean delay resulting from trial.

2

And so I think the definition that we've

3

given you again, which is, delay results from a trial if

4

the trial itself is postponed, or if the trial is set in

5

a way that accommodates the motion, is the only way to

6

give meaning to the operative words in the statute.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it doesn't matter how

8

substantial and important a motion is, whether it was

9

your motion to dismiss for Speedy Trial Act reasons or

10

the administrative motions here that you say really

11

didn't require time?

12

matters is keeping track from day one, the commencement

13

of the trial, as to when the Court is about to set the

14

trial date, that it does it at the end of all the

15

motions.

16

It doesn't matter; all that

That's the only time the court can do it.
MR. FISHER:

The distinction between

17

administrative and nonadministrative motions, I think,

18

doesn't matter in this case because trial wasn't -

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. FISHER:

Why wouldn't it matter?

Well, it would matter, I think,

21

Justice Sotomayor, in a circumstance where the trial

22

date hadn't been set yet and then was set, and an

23

argument might arise -- well, I think we've had this

24

dialogue already to some degree.

25

these kinds of motions to be filed.

I didn't -- I expected

42

Alderson Reporting Company

I knew there was

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to be a suppression hearing.

2

therefore, I set the trial out.

3

saying this was a nonadministrative matter that I had to

4

accommodate.

5

way, I don't think a trial judge could say I'm setting

6

trial date outside the 70-day deadline because I had to

7

sign my name to that pro haec vice motion.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We had the whole -

Well, actually it

In the "rocket docket" in

10

Virginia, the court sets a trial date, and you file

11

whatever motions you're going to file.

12

theory, until that last motion actually delays the trial

13

date, none of those motions exclude time.

14

MR. FISHER:

Under your

That may well be correct, but I

15

don't know why it would matter, because it doesn't

16

matter until you get outside of the 70 days to begin

17

with.

18

So -
JUSTICE BREYER:

It matters because the

19

trial judges have to know what to do, and while your

20

reading might fit the language in ordinary English

21

better, I think it does.

22

It's also possible to read those words

23

"delay resulting from" as simply referring to a period

24

of time; and the statute is saying these periods of time

25

are excluded from accounting.

Now, the virtue of that

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the

2

trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get

3

mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for,

4

in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it,

5

do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying

6

to figure out what causes what.

7

MR. FISHER:

Let me say a couple things,

8

Justice Breyer.

First, with all due respect, I have to

9

disagree with your premise that it's possible to read

10

the statute the way the Solicitor General wants to read

11

it.

12

question, let's imagine that it were possible to read it

13

that way.

Circuit for 17 months.

19

Now I'll accept for purposes of responding to your

I think our rule is not as difficult to

And indeed the Solicitor General -- this has

They haven't pointed to a single

Now let me take the other side, and this

20

brings us to the dialogue during Mr. Roberts' argument;

21

the Solicitor General's rule isn't so easy, either,

22

unless you simply cease caring at all about the Act.

23

You could have a perfectly administrable rule that says

24

every singly motion, no matter what the circumstances,

25

tolls the clock.
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But that's not the law in the First Circuit,

2

for example.

3

said that if a motion is filed to frustrate the speedy

4

trial clock, then we're not going to exclude it; and

5

that makes perfect sense.

6

And I'm not going to suggest there was any ill will or

7

bad faith in this case; but the facts of the case

8

illustrate the problem.

9

They're made clear as Justice Sotomayor

I mean, look at this case.

12

reading there were only 10 days left on the clock.

13

if no motions had been filed, unquestionably we would

14

have a Speedy Trial Act violation.

15

whole case hinges on the fact that because it filed this

16

purely administrative motion to bring a gun into the

17

courtroom, a motion I might add that at the pretrial

18

conference the judge had already told the government was

19

going to be granted, and so I don't know why it couldn't

20

have been made at the moment the evidence was

21

introduced; and one other administration motion, then

22

the Speedy Trial Act isn't violated.

23

There were 14 days before the trial was going to

So

So the government's

And to borrow the Solicitor General's own

24

phrase from page 38 of his brief, that outcome bears no

25

relation to the Act's purpose.

So what you have to do

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to have, I think, the government's argument be at all

2

faithful, even if it were possible under the language -

3

have it be at all faithful with the purpose of the Act,

4

is to have some kind of exception for motions that

5

frustrate, motions that are pretextual, motions that are

6

purely administrative, however it would be defined.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. FISHER:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why do you think that -

And you walk in -
-- your motion -- I mean,

10

the government had administrative motions, but you had a

46

Alderson Reporting Company

the time I had the pretrial conference and the time

2

trial started, there wasn't a slew of motions, because

3

that's about the time counsel tends to wake up.

4

MR. FISHER:

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Yes.

Okay?

And -- and decide

that really now they've got to get ready.

8

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why should we care

10

whether it's an administrative motion or simply to

11

clarify the functioning of the trial?

12

exclude those times, because those -- those motions,

13

whether they're administrative or not, will cause the

14

trial to go faster, because issues that would otherwise

15

consume the time of the court during trial are being

16

resolved before trial.

17

MR. FISHER:

Why should we not

I think that might be an

18

argument for writing the Speedy Trial Act a different

19

way, Justice Sotomayor; but if the question is whether

20

the motion delayed trial -- and that's the question that

21

the Speedy Trial Act requires the judge to ask and

22

answer -- then the administrative piece of paper going

23

across the judge's desk when the judge knows ahead of

24

time it isn't going to cause any difficult, simply

25

doesn't delay trial.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the word "from," Justice Scalia.

I think it's a tough

2

word to know exactly what transition is taking place

3

there, but in this Court's Bloate decision, last term, I

4

think -- what I'm -- the argument I'm making is

5

perfectly consistent with that decision, where it said

6

the "from clause" is sort of the boundaries on when

7

subsection D applies.

8

that a motion caused either after the hearing or before

9

the filing, we don't want to hear from you.

If you're talking about delay

But the

10

from clause tells you if the delay falls within those

11

two goalposts, then it's excludable.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

It's a funny way to say it.

14

MR. FISHER:

It's a funny way to say it.

I don't think it's a perfect

15

way to say it, either, Justice Scalia.

16

my dialogue with Justice Alito, I think that you could

17

also say, especially with a little bit of pushing on

18

Henderson, that "resulting from" actually gives you a

19

specific time period in between those that you have to

20

exclude.

the Act, and again, it's the only one that gives -- that

22

gives meaning to the phrase delay resulting from.

23

And I said -- in

If I might just say one or two words to

24

circle back to where I began, Mr. Tinklenberg urges you

25

to affirm the Sixth Circuit decision or to dismiss this
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case as improvidently granted; but what he urges you not

2

to do and thinks there's no basis in precedent for

3

doing, which is to reverse the lower court without

4

reading the alternative arguments; and with all due

5

respect, the 10-day argument that we preserved in our

8

difficult to get around in this case for all the reasons

9

I've explained.

So with that, I'll -- I'll answer any other

11

questions this Court has about that argument, because I

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

17

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

18

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

19

First I would like to stress that the

20

government thinks that it's very important that the

21

Court address the question that we raised in our cert

22

petition, and that the Court granted certiorari to

23

answer, on which there's a split in the circuits and

24

which we believe that if it's left standing will result

25

in serious disruption to the Speedy Trial Act.
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Turning to -- to that question, a few points

2

first.

3

inconsistent with Henderson which already holds that the

4

period of delay that's excludable is the time between

5

the filing of the motion and the disposition of the

6

motion.

7

delay is the period during which trial is postponed.

8

Second, Respondent's definition of delay

9

Respondent's definition of delay is plainly

That can't be squared with the notion that

gives delay a different meaning in the first part of the

10

statute and in subsection D, where this Court's already

11

held that it has the meaning that we suggest.

12

Third, Respondent's test is totally

13

unworkable, because you can't tell at the time a motion

14

is filed how much time it's going to take to resolve and

15

whether trial is going to be postponed.

16

judges have over 500 pending cases on their docket, an

Respondent says that NACDL says defendants

23

won't object or that they'll stipulate to the exclusion

24

of time, but NACDL also says that defendants may change

25

their mind if the case goes to trial, and if they change
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

their mind and file a motion to dismiss under the Speedy

2

Trial Act, their prior failures to object and

3

stipulations may very well not be binding because this

4

Court held in Zedner that defendants can prospectively

5

waive the application of the Act.

6

tests would also throw the established way that the

7

Speedy Trial Act has been operating for over 30 years

8

into disarray.

And Respondent's

9

Turning to whether this Court has to address

10

the alternative arguments for affirmance, Nobles plainly

11

says that the Court has discretion not to address those

12

issues if those issues are not independently worthy of

13

certiorari.

14

the -- on the fact that the argument would expand the

15

judgment below, and the rule that it's discretionary

16

makes sense, because the contrary rule would require the

17

court to address numerous issues that are not important

18

and -- in every case where they're raised, and would

19

also lead the court to either dismiss writs as

20

improvidently granted or to address only as dicta

21

important issues on which the Court has granted

22

certiorari.

It doesn't base that on the fact that
