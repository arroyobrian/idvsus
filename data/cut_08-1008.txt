Mr. Nelson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NELSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Since the inception of the Rules Enabling

12

Act, this Court has repeatedly held that within their

13

scope of operation, rules promulgated under that Act

14

govern the practice and procedure of Federal courts in

15

diversity and Federal question cases alike.

16

This case concerns whether a New York State

17

law prohibiting New York State courts from certifying a

18

class applies in a Federal diversity action and

19

displaces the otherwise applicable Federal class

20

certification standards set forth in Federal Rule of

21

Civil Procedure 23.

22

Whether the case is viewed as presenting a

23

question under the Rules Enabling Act as construed in

24

Hanna v. Plumer, or instead more generally as an Erie

25

question, the answer is the same.

The State rule does

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not govern.

That result is underscored by the Class

2

Action Fairness Act, which extended Federal diversity

3

jurisdiction to cases of this type precisely so that

4

Federal procedural standards would apply.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the --

But this is a procedural

6

standard that has a manifestly substantive purpose,

7

which is to restrict recoveries of penalties.

8

sense, it's like a cap on damages.

9

then the purpose that New York had would be completely

In that

And if you're right,

10

undermined, because what lawyer would bring a $500 case

11

in State court when she could bring a $5 million case in

12

Federal court?

13

MR. NELSON:

Well, to begin with, I ­- I

14

don't think that it's a substantive rule because it

15

reflects a policy.

16

New York Court of Appeals in the Sperry case, is that

17

the -- the legislature believed that class actions were

18

not necessary in this category of cases.

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

The policy here, as described by the

I think that is ultimately a procedural
policy.

It's not a limitation on -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They didn't want to have

class actions.
MR. NELSON:

They certainly did not want to

have class actions, Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And how is it different

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs?

2

Procedural in one sense, but with a definite substantive

3

purpose in mind; that is, to restrict derivative

4

actions.

5

MR. NELSON:

Well, the Cohen case I think is

6

different in this respect, although when Cohen was

7

decided shareholder derivative actions together with

8

class actions were under Rule 23.

9

Those things have now been divorced, and

10

shareholder derivative actions differ from class actions

11

in the Rule 23 sense in a fundamental way.

12

the class is composed solely of individuals who each

13

have a substantive right to pursue that recovery under

14

the relevant law.

15

is actually asserting a substantive right to -- to

16

really assert a claim on behalf of someone else, the

17

corporation.

18

In Rule 23,

In a derivative action, the plaintiff

And what the Court said in Cohen and

19

elaborated more in the Kamen case in 1991 is that that

20

question is really a matter of the law of

21

shareholder-corporate relations, the circumstances in

22

which a shareholder may bring a derivative suit, and

23

isn't really answered by the Federal rules.

24

Cohen in particular, what the Court focused on --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in

You could say just as

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

well here that the question isn't addressed by the

2

Federal rules.

3

claim can be brought only as an individual action, not

4

as a class action, why shouldn't the Federal

5

court say that's perfectly fine; this class of cases

6

can't be brought as a class action; we respect the

7

State's position on that.

8

court in a diversity case create a claim that the ­-

9

that the State never created?

10

If New York wants to say this kind of

MR. NELSON:

Why should we as a Federal

Well, the reason is that Rule

11

23 actually does address the issue, and it's the same

12

issue that the -- that the State rule tries to address,

13

which is whether the matters may be certified as a

14

class.

15

Not only does Rule 23(b) provide explicitly

16

that the court may certify an action if the Rule 23(b)

17

(1), (2), or (3) criteria are met, but this Court also

18

emphasized in the Califano v. Yamasaki case that under

19

Rule 1, the Federal rules apply to all actions in the

20

Federal courts.

21

it in Yamasaki, is that a class action is available,

22

potentially, if the 23 standards are satisfied, in any

23

action within the Federal courts, unless Congress has

24

exercised its power to override a Federal rule, which,

25

as the author of Federal law, Congress is always

And what that means, as the Court put

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

empowered to do.

2

The difference as to -- as to the State is

3

that the State has no power to displace Federal law, and

4

Rule 23, promulgated under the Rules Enabling Act, is

5

Federal law.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This Court in its recent

7

decisions has been sensitive to not overriding State

8

limitations, and so has read the Federal rule to avoid

9

the conflict.

10

Gasperini is one such case with regard to

11

Rule 59, interpreted so that you do not collide with the

12

State policy, and the same thing with Semtek with Rule

13

41(b).

14

conflict with the State policy.

The Federal rule is interpreted so as not to

MR. NELSON:

15

Well, I would -- I would

16

actually first go back to what the Court said in Walker,

17

and I don't think it's -- Walker v. Armco, and I don't

18

think it's disavowed that that the Federal rule is given

19

its plain meaning, and when a collision is unavoidable,

20

the Court -- the Court recognizes conflict.

21

Gasperini, I think, is -- is different, with

22

due respect to someone who probably knows more about it

23

than I do.

24

Court there saying that what is going to be applied in

25

the Federal court is what it saw as a substantive

But as I read Gasperini at least, I see the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

standard limiting damages.

2

excessive if they are in excess of -- manifestly exceed

3

what is ­-

4
5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
damages in Gasperini.

6
7

sorry.

10

But there wasn't a cap on

It wasn't a cap.

MR. NELSON:

It was --

It wasn't -- excuse me.

I'm

Go ahead.

8
9

That is to say, damages are

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was that we want the

courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so
they won't be excessive.
MR. NELSON:

11

Well, the -- the Court in

12

Gasperini said what it saw was a substantive principle

13

of New York law, was that damages could not exceed

14

reasonable compensation for the -- for the plaintiff's

15

injuries.

16

of $1 million, $5 million, $50,000.

17

the sense of providing the substantive standard by which

18

the court determines excessiveness.

19

Now, that -- that is not a cap in the sense
But it's a cap in

And as for Rule 59, the reason the Court saw

20

no conflict there is Rule 59 simply provides the

21

procedural mechanism within which a defendant makes a

22

motion to seek a new trial on the grounds of

23

excessiveness of damages.

24
25

But it -- but excessiveness of damages is,
to go back to a point that was made in the previous

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argument, like fairness.

2

Excessiveness of damages has to be judged according to

3

what the State law is on what damages one is entitled to

4

recover.

5

Fairness in relation to what?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under -- under your

6

theory, are all of the statutes set forth by the

7

Respondents in their appendices invalid in Federal

8

court?

9

MR. NELSON:

No, Your Honor, certainly not.

10

Especially given that their appendix -- half of it

11

consists of Federal statutes, which of course are valid

12

because Congress -- Congress can --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. NELSON:

15
16

Well, not half.

Well, a significant number.

I

-- I think it's -- it's a goodly number.
Now, as to the State statutes, I think the

17

State statutes are very different.

18

may not be valid, but they operate very differently from

19

the State statute at issue here.

20

Some of them may or

They focus on particular rights of action.

21

Some of them set forth limits on recovery that really

22

are set forth as damages caps, and all of them are tied

23

specifically to the substantive cause of action created

24

by State law.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So suppose in this case

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the New York legislature, instead of having a statute

2

that covered penalties generally, minimum recoveries

3

generally, wrote into each statute, each penalty

4

statute, each minimal recovery statute, that this suit

5

must -- may not be brought as a class action -- instead

6

of having

7

them, wrote into each individual statute that

8

limitation.

9

an encompassing statute that covered all of

MR. NELSON:

I would agree that that

10

presents a very different question.

11

still not certain that I -- that I think that the State

12

court can do that, because I don't think that a

13

limitation on whether an action can be brought as a

14

class establishes substantive rights within the meaning

15

of the Rules Enabling Act.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm not -- I'm

So you -- are you telling

17

me that even if New York had provided for a specific

18

penalty for a specific matter, the Federal court could

19

disregard that and make it a class action, even if the

20

State that created the right said, this is a right for

21

an individual only?

22

MR. NELSON:

Well, I -- again, I think

23

that's what the best answer to that question would be,

24

because the -- the right in a class action is still an

25

individual right; it's simply the -- the question is

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

simply whether multiple claims of multiple parties can

2

be aggregated in a single action.

3

the right that the -- that the State legislature has

4

created for the individual.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That doesn't expand

Are you saying that even

6

if it -- then you are telling me it doesn't make any

7

difference whether they do it across the board, as they

8

did here, or in each penalty statute it says no class

9

action.

10

MR. NELSON:

Again, what I'm saying is it

11

certainly may make a difference in the sense that the

12

Court doesn't have to go nearly that far to resolve this

13

case.
If that case were presented, I'm simply

14
15

saying that -- that I still don't think that that

16

necessarily establishes a substantive right within the

17

meaning of the Rules Enabling Act.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

Well, does it or not?

19

mean, it presented you -- here's a case that says:

20

can sue for this penalty but only in an individual

21

action.

22

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

I
You

As I've said, I think the

23

best answer to that question is:

That does not

24

establish a substantive right.

25

procedural right with respect to --

It establishes a

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you are saying that

2

even if New York didn't use this shorthand, even if they

3

incorporated it into each penalty statute, your answer

4

would be the same --

5

MR. NELSON:

Yes, my answer would be the

6

same, but this -- the result here doesn't turn on that

7

answer being correct.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was you are entitled to

10

$100 as a statutory penalty but only if it's an

11

individual claim.

12

class action, you don't get the statutory penalty.

13

thought that was the substance of her question.

14
15
16

If you -- if this is brought as a
I

Now, are you saying that also is merely
procedural and -- and pre-empted by Rule 23?
MR. NELSON:

I think -- I think it's

17

procedural in the sense that it establishes -- if it

18

establishes a right, the right it establishes is

19

procedural and procedural rights don't override the --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, you get $100 or

21

you don't get $100.

22

than getting the $100 or not getting the $100?

23

How can you be any less substantive

MR. NELSON:

Whether you -- when ­ when

24

what determines whether you get it is the form of the

25

action that you have brought in a Federal court and

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether it has been brought aggregated with other --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then under your view,

3

there is absolutely nothing, no law that the State could

4

pass that would not conflict with Rule 23 --

5

MR. NELSON:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

10

MR. NELSON:

I mean, one thing that the

Court could do is that it could establish a cap that
applied with respect to -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11
12

-- as it -- as with

respect to class actions?

8
9

No.

You mean the State could

do.

13

MR. NELSON:

I'm sorry, yes.

I misspoke.

14

The State could certainly establish a cap that applied

15

whether an action was brought as a class action or an

16

individual action.

17

series of transactions, the overall damages to which

18

this defendant can be subjected, whether in a

19

multiplicity of individual actions or in a class action

20

is X.

21

In other words, for any related

That, I think, would clearly be substantive.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

apply to individual actions as well?

23

MR. NELSON:

Well, it has to

I think -- I think if -- if the

24

application of the -- of the statute depends on

25

whether -- whether the action is brought as a Rule 23

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

action in Federal court or not, to me that's -- that is

2

placing consequences on a procedural issue, and is not a

3

matter of substance.

4

But, again, I want to emphasize that this

5

statute is very different from that.

6

statute that is not even limited to rights of action

7

under New York State law.

8
9

This statute is a

This is an action that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Have they applied it?

If I recall your brief correctly, you say that the New

10

York courts have applied it to causes of action arising

11

under other State laws.

12

MR. NELSON:

13
14
15
16

Is that right?
I -- I actually haven't found

one that applies it to actions arising under other State
laws.

I have -- I found actions that apply it to

actions arising under Federal law.

And the principal one

--

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

Court of Appeals decision to that effect?

19

MR. NELSON:

There is no New York

That is correct.

They are

20

rules -- there are decisions of the appellant division.

21

But, as you know this Court very shortly after deciding

22

Erie emphasized, holdings of intermediate State court of

23

appeals are very persuasive data as to what State law

24

is.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It depends upon the

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

persuasiveness of the reasoning of the court.

2

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

And in this case, the

3

statute on its face uses the term "right of an action

4

brought under a statute."

5

901(b) that it's limited to New York State statutes.

6

The term "statute" in the -- in the Civil Practice Law

7

and Rules is not confined to New York State statutes.

8
9

There is no suggestion in

Section 901 as a whole clearly is applicable
to -- to rights of action brought under any source of

10

law.

And the New York State courts in the -- the most

11

applicable case, the Rudgayzer case, justified its

12

application of the statute to a Federal right of action

13

on the ground that this was merely an -- a -- a rule

14

that governed local forms of -- of proceeding.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

Can't a statute be both?

16

Can a statute both establish a substantive limitation

17

and also establish a rule of procedure for New York

18

courts?

19

not entertain any action, including those arising under

20

foreign law, that are class actions seeking penalties?

21

And also, no New York State cause of action which seeks

22

a penalty can be sued on in a -- in a collaborative

23

action?

24
25

Why can't a statute say, New York courts will

Couldn't you do both in the same?
MR. NELSON:

Well, a statute certainly

phrased that way could do both.

The question is when

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the statute is not phrased that way, when it's phrased

2

simply as a general procedural instruction as part of

3

the general procedural --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you are begging the

5

question.

6

can't the instruction be interpreted to be both?

7

It's a general instruction.

MR. NELSON:

But can't --

Well, the -- the question I

8

think is -- is what basis would there be for construing

9

it to be both?

10

It -- it -- it's unitary in language --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because the statute may

11

put forth both a substantive policy and a procedural

12

policy.

13

I'll give you a concrete example.
New York establishes a claim and says in the

14

statute:

15

within 1 year.

16

under another State's law, and it says, even though we

17

applied our -- even though our statute applies to our

18

own law in a substantive way -- that is, it says you

19

have no action after a certain amount of time ­- we

20

don't want our courts to be cluttered with claims from

21

out of State when we wouldn't entertain similar claims

22

in our own State.

23

But this sort of claim has to be brought
Then New York gets a similar claim

That is certainly the way statutes of

24

limitations have been interpreted by a number of States

25

as having both a procedural aspect and a substantive

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

aspect.

2

MR. NELSON:

Well, I -- I certainly agree

3

that statutes of limitations are generally applied by

4

State courts to foreign causes of action.

5

because, I think, for choice of law purposes, they are

6

considered and were traditionally considered to be

7

procedural matters.

8

that they were characterized as substantive matters for

9

purposes of -- of the application of -- of the

10

And that's

It's only with the advent of Erie

doctrine.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

Well, that is not

12

altogether true, because there was always recognition

13

that a so-called built-in statute of limitations was

14

substantive.

15

MR. NELSON:

If -- if the right of action

16

itself is delimited, as opposed to a statute of

17

limitation which, you know, cuts off your ability to

18

sue but supposedly doesn't cut off the underlying

19

right, yes, I think that's right.

20

to -- to the fact that, you know, it does make a

21

difference whether a legislature chooses to establish a

22

rule as a general procedural matter or whether it makes

23

it integral to the -- to the definition of the right.

24
25

But, again, that goes

And as this Court said in the -- in the Byrd
case, that when looking at -- at State law -- and there

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the question was whether an issue was an issue for the

2

jury.

3

to be substantive or procedural, the question is whether

4

it is so bound up with the definition of the rights and

5

obligations under State law that it will be deemed to be

6

part of the substance of the law or whether it simply

7

relates to a mode of enforcing the right.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9
10

But in determining whether it would be considered

And -- and --

I thought Byrd turned on

the characteristics of a Federal court and that is the
judge/jury relationship.
MR. NELSON:

11

Well, Byrd -- Byrd turns in

12

part on that, but it also turns on -- on the Court's

13

view that -- that that issue, whether a case -- an issue

14

is decided by -- by jury or judge, is -- is one that is

15

not substantive under the Erie doctrine.

16

are two aspects, I think, to what the Court is doing in

17

Byrd.

18

So -- so there

But one of them -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it wouldn't matter

19

what the answer to that was, with the Seventh Amendment

20

looming over that case.

21

MR. NELSON:

Well, you know, the Court

22

didn't decide it as a Seventh Amendment issue, and --

23

and because that particular question, I think, was --

24

was a question that arose out of a State law

25

administrative scheme, I think it's controversial

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether it -- whether the Seventh Amendment would apply,

2

and the Court, I think, advisedly decided that as an

3

Erie case rather than as a Seventh Amendment case.

4

I want to also --

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

hypothetical?

7

MR. NELSON:

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

Can I ask you one brief

Sure.
Supposing this statute,

instead of being as broad as it is, said any statute

10

imposing penalties against insurance companies may not

11

be brought as a class action, any claims brought under

12

that statute?

13

MR. NELSON:

Justice Stevens, I think the

14

outcome there would more clearly be the same, because,

15

again, it would not be -- it would not be part of the --

16

of the New York State law definition of the right to

17

insurance --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I thought you said that if

19

it puts a ceiling on it, that would be -- that would be

20

substantive rather than procedural.

21

MR. NELSON:

22

Well, if -- if -- if the Court

put a ceiling on rights of action under its own law --

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

MR. NELSON: -- its own State laws, that I

25

Right.

think becomes a substantive matter.

19
Alderson Reporting Company

The statute that I

Official

1

think you've -- you've hypothesized here is one that is

2

based on the characteristics of the defendant regardless

3

of the source of law under which it's being sued.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, you can make it a

5

claim brought under the insurance code, instead of

6

against insurance companies.

7

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

Well, that then, I think,

8

becomes very similar to the -- the hypothetical statutes

9

that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor were positing, and

10

I acknowledge that that is -- that that is a much harder

11

question.

12

But, again, I think, ultimately, if the ­-

13

if the issue addressed by the statute is, shall claims

14

of individuals be aggregated and adjudicated as part of

15

one unit, that is a substantive matter -- or a

16

procedural matter and is governed in the Federal courts

17

by a Federal procedural standard.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the basis

19

for the restriction is the additional administrative

20

costs of a class action?

21

say you can't bring it, but it says any recovery shall

22

be reduced by 10 percent because class actions cost more

23

than individual actions?

24
25

MR. NELSON:

In other words, it doesn't

Well, there -- that I think

would be a statute that is serving a manifestly

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

procedural interest, and if the Federal courts have not

2

chosen in their rules to impose an administrative charge

3

on class actions, a State law that purported to do so

4

would -- would not -- not have any application to

5

Federal procedure.

6

That -- that statute I think would be not

7

only foreclosed in its operation by the Rules Enabling

8

Act and Hanna v. Plumer, but would just be, on its face,

9

something that, even leaving aside the Federal rules,

10

would fall on the procedural side of the line in just

11

classic Erie terms because the policies that it reflects

12

are manifestly procedural.

13
14
15

And I think, actually, the same is true
here.

A statute -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How is it different from

16

security for costs?

I mean, that's what I started with.

17

That's -- there's nothing in the Federal rules that

18

say security for costs.

19

MR. NELSON:

Well, the -- the -- as I

20

understand the Court's reasoning in Cohen, the security

21

was -- was not just for the cost of the action, but for

22

the plaintiff's liability to the corporation that was

23

created under State law in the case of an unsuccessful

24

derivative action.

25

And that liability was what the Court looked

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

at in Cohen as -- as making -- making the fundamental

2

issue substantive, and the bond was sort of the -- you

3

know, the tail on the dog, in the sense that the Court

4

characterized it as substantive, having first

5

characterized the damages remedy as substantive because

6

without the bond, according to the majority, the remedy

7

would be meaningless.

8
9
10

I -- you know, the proposition was certainly
debatable -- even Justice -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Without the bond, the

11

remedy would be -- I don't -- this is a plaintiff

12

that had to put up security for costs.

13

MR. NELSON:

Right, and -- but -- but the

14

remedy I'm referring to is the defendant's right to

15

recover damages from the plaintiff under State law if a

16

derivative action was unsuccessful.

17

that remedy that the -- that the Court saw the bond to

18

be critical to, which was not only why it -- it treated

19

it as substantive, but also granted an interlocutory

20

appeal because, if -- if the bond wasn't there, the

21

right to recover from this plaintiff would be -- would

22

be meaningless.

23
24
25

And it was securing

That was -- that was, as I understand it,
the Court's reasoning.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LANDAU

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7
8
9

MR. LANDAU:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As some of Justice Ginsburg's initial

10

questions point out, this case falls within the

11

heartland of Erie because allowing plaintiffs to recover

12

State law penalties in Federal court that they can't

13

recover in State court on a State law cause of action

14

would powerfully distort ex ante forum choices, which is

15

precisely what the Erie doctrine seeks to avoid.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't Rule 23 a

17

judgment by Congress that class actions that meet the

18

criteria of Rule 23 are fair and efficient, correct?

19

That's Congress's judgment?

20

MR. LANDAU:

No, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Under your theory, any

22

State could pass a law that says no cause of action

23

under State law can be brought as a class action ever.

24

That would be your theory because it's substantive, if

25

it's an Erie choice.

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. LANDAU:

Two points, Your Honor.

First,

2

of course, Rule 23 is not enacted by Congress.

3

one of the important points here, that it comes out of

4

this Court.

5

That's

It's delegated authority under the Rules

6

Enabling Act to set forth these rules, so there is

7

always a limitation on what a rule of procedure can do.

8

That's why there is an advisory committee that sets it.

9

It's not a statute, and there are -- there are

10

restrictions on -- on the rules that don't apply to

11

Congress.

12

But going to the substance of your question,

13

Your Honor, Rule 23 governs the criteria for when --

14

when you can have a class, but it doesn't address the

15

underlying question, which is:

16

the first place?

17

Can you have a class in

Is there -- the legislature that creates the

18

cause of action can say, this is categorically

ineligible for class certification.

22

MR. LANDAU:

I'm sorry.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your State can come in

24

and say, no State cause of action will ever be subject

25

to class treatment.

And you would say there is no

MR. LANDAU:

11

Well, Your Honor, it could be,

12

if a State said that no State cause of action could be

13

brought as a class action, that that -- you have to look

14

at what the State was doing in making that rule.

There are some things -- we make a policy choice,

That's what the State has said as a policy
choice, correct?
MR. LANDAU:

policy choice, as I believe -- your hypothetical, at

some points, was talking about what sounded like a

substantive policy choice.

If it makes a procedural policy choice, as,
in a sense, Mississippi has done and Virginia, by simply

not having class actions at all -- they don't have that

12

Rules of Decision Act because it's not --

So you have answered my

Under your view, a State could say, no class

MR. LANDAU:

A State --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and a Federal

18

court, sitting in diversity, could never aggregate those

19

claims, those State law claims?
MR. LANDAU:

20

For State law claims, yes.

If

21

it makes a substantive decision that we want -- a State

22

could abolish that cause of action altogether, Your

23

Honor.

24

expressing is somehow that Federal courts could be

25

flooded with State law causes of action.

Here, in this case, it happens to be --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

basis or on an individual basis?

MR. LANDAU:

I think that's something that

one could look at, as part of determining how -- what is
the design and operation in State court.
And on that point, I'll say the other side

11
12

does try to make it seem like it is absolutely

13

dispositive that this is being applied more broadly than

There is two responses.

4

difference, and it could have argued or analyzed the

5

case the way you said, but the appellate division there

6

did exactly what your adversary said it did.

7

MR. LANDAU:

We read the language of

broadly to all New York -- to all

11

said the TCPA is a special statute that refers to the

12

law of the State.

13

think the Rudgayzer case, if you look at the analysis,

14

it supports us.

It looked at the TCPA and

It's an unusual statute.

So again, I

But even more broadly, Your Honor, I think

15
16

the key point is what they are trying to get at somehow

17

by -- by saying that this applies broadly is to say that

18

New York would treat this as procedural.

19

-- they are asking this Court essentially to speculate

20

on that.

21

New York Court of Appeals 2 years ago addressed this

22

statute in quite some detail in the Sperry case, and the

New York Court of Appeals actually went through why the

24

statute was adopted, why 901(b) was adopted.

be overdeterrence and overkill in the class action

feel that the class action procedure is one that leads

to forcing companies to settle, and to that extent the

class action procedure does not lead to the efficient

14

determination of disputes but to the inefficient and

unjust determination.

5

of actions brought on a class-wide basis and they were

your position if you're saying, look, we've only got $20

MR. LANDAU:

I would agree with Your Honor.

7

If you have an unadorned prohibition on class actions in

the State -- from a State, I think the most natural

9

understanding of that is that was their determination of

10

how the procedures in their courts are going to work.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

It has to be one or the

other, though.

this rule to out-of-State causes of action, and if it

did, you -- you ought to have lost this case.

So New York State could not apply this --

MR. LANDAU:

No, Your Honor -- again, I

18

think they can blend.

I think in Gasperini this Court

19

pointed out that the -- the heightened standard of

20

judicial review of damages awards had a manifestly -- it

21

was a procedural command with a manifestly substantive

22

purpose.

23

Instead -- the cases in Appendix A say that in a

24

class -- excuse me, the statutes say in a class action

25

you may not recover more than X.

I think this case is not really dissimilar.

35
Alderson Reporting Company

The only difference

Official

1

here is it says, if you are seeking to recover more than

2

X, you may not have a class action.

3

And with respect to the statutes in Appendix

4

B, those say there may not be a class action for

5

particular causes of action.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't -New York doesn't have --

7

as the -- the question that Justice Sotomayor asked and

8

that Justice Stevens asked -- doesn't have any

9

anti-class action as a procedural policy.

It has picked

10

out a particular kind of action, one for a penalty, one

11

where there's -- what is it -- minimum recovery, and

12

said that category, we have -- we're not anti-class

13

action in general, but these penalties that we created,

14

we don't want those brought as class actions.

15

MR. LANDAU:

Precisely, Your Honor.

And I

16

think that underscores is why this is substantive or the

17

fact that this reflects a substantive policy decision.

18

It is not about the efficiency or operation of the

19

class action process itself, the judicial process.

20

is a substantive decision to calibrate the remedy that

21

New York has afforded under its own law, and a decision

22

that when you have penalties that New York has decided

23

-- and the Sperry case is very explicit on this -- that

24

New York made a decision that the -- the appropriate

25

level of enforcement for those was the level in an

36
Alderson Reporting Company

This

1

individual action, and that when you got -- when you

2

tried to make it into a class, that that would be

3

overenforcement of those.

4

And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One -- one question that

5

was raised by the other side is, well, if you're saying

6

this kind of restriction -- restriction on class action

7

-- applies in a diversity case, why not a State that

8

says we love class actions and we want class actions to

9

be -- not to be hemmed in by all of the Rule 23

10

requirements?
MR. LANDAU:

11

Then, Your Honor, you would

12

have a Hanna issue because Rule 23 does set forth the

13

criteria for a Federal court to certify a class.
State law cannot change or water down those

18

Our position, Your Honor, our point is that

19

you don't get to the Rule 23 criteria if the State law

20

or the substantive law that creates the cause of action

21

sends you off the highway before you get into the land

22

of the criteria.

23

If it just says, this is categorically

24

unavailable as a class, as many States have, in fact,

25

done in the statutes in Appendix B -- they have come up

16

the restriction on class actions is either substantive

17

or procedural.

If they say, we are not going to allow class

MR. LANDAU:

Well, Your Honor, I think what

19

you can -- you can assume that, if they are not changing

20

their criteria and not changing the rules governing all

21

class actions, but singling out particular causes of

22

action or particular penalties, that it's done for a

23

substantive reason.

24
25

Here, in New York, we actually know that's
true because the Sperry court says that.

38

And one, I

think, important point in 901(b) is the initial clause,

2

the "unless" clause, that we have been focusing a lot on

3

the last clause that says it may not be brought as a --

4

as a class action, if it's seeking a statutory penalty.

5

But it says, "unless a statute creating or

6

imposing a penalty or minimum measure of recovery

7

specifically authorizes the recovery thereof in a class

8

action."

9

That's showing, that even though this is

10

located in the CPLR, that it's really part and parcel of

11

their statutory regime.

12

13

It's saying, this is our

To be sure, a New York statute can override

14

that, but the idea that this is somehow simply

15

procedural because it's in the CPLR is really belied by

16

that language that -- that really shows that -- and,

17

frankly, I think it also belies the fact that this

18

applies to causes of action outside of New York because

19

the "unless" clause really can only be understood as

20

setting a default baseline for the New York legislature

21

in enacting a statute, that they may want to

22

specifically authorize class actions for penalties.

23

So, again, I think --

And I think the point -- I

21

agree 100 percent.

22

that point underscores, Your Honor, is that, ultimately,

23

the Erie issue is a Federal issue.

25

I think the point that you are --

You can look to New York to try to
understand the design and operation of the State rule at

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

issue, but, ultimately, you are being asked, as a

2

Federal court, to set the appropriate relationship

3

between the State court system and the Federal court

4

system.

5

And, again, the lesson of Erie is you don't

6

want to create incentives that will bring people like a

7

magnet to Federal court and distort these ex ante

8

foreign choices of litigants for State law claims.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, they -- they bring

10

up the Class Action Fairness Act, which allows a

11

plaintiff -- they allow a defendant to remove a

12

class action from a State court to a Federal court, but

13

they also allow a plaintiff to initiate an action in the

14

Federal court.
MR. LANDAU:

15

That's correct, Your Honor, but

16

the Class Action Fairness Act, on its face -- and the

17

legislative history actually makes this point explicit

18

-- it had no intention to change the operation of the

19

Erie doctrine in class actions.
And so there is nothing in the Class Action

20
21

Fairness Act that changes the scope of Rule 23.

22

Rule 23 just doesn't address this antecedent issue.

23

assumes, but does not require, that you have a cause of

24

action that is amenable to class certification in the

25

first place.

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Again,
It

Official

1

And if you were to construe Rule 23

2

otherwise, as overriding this kind of statute -- all the

3

statutes in Appendix B, that would be a truly remarkably

4

substantive interpretation that this Court has always

5

stressed, that it must, in construing the rules, be

6

careful not to tread into that territory and has

7

construed the rules with an eye towards the limitations

8

of the Rules Enabling Act.

9

The other side -- Shady Grove would walk you

10

right into an extremely problematic situation from the

11

point of view of the Rules Enabling Act, as well as

12

creating these -- these incentives that really go

13

against the heart of the Erie doctrine that would turn a

14

$500 case into a $5 million case.

15

And one interesting point, I think, is that

16

all these statutes that are listed in our Appendix B

17

that limit class certification for particular causes of

18

action -- under their theory that Rule 23 requires that

19

everything be amenable to class certification, those

20

would all be out the window.

21

I don't think counsel really wanted to admit

22

that this morning, but the logic of their theory that ­-

23

is that Rule 23 governs this case and Rule 23 requires

24

that every cause of action that comes before it be

25

eligible for class certification.

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That would knock out each and every one of

2

the statutes in Appendix B.

They don't live up to -- in

3

their reply brief, at footnote 10, on page 15, they try

4

to distinguish those statutes by saying, ah, well, the

5

limitation on class actions in those statutes is in the

6

substantive cause of action.

7

It's not in -- it's not somewhere else in

8

the code, but that doesn't -- that doesn't save their

9

argument under Rule 23.

They really can't square that

10

with their -- their core position that Rule 23 itself

11

answers the question presented in this case.
And, again, what we would ask the Court is

12
13

just to -- is to recognize that Rule 23 occupies the

14

ground it occupies, but it doesn't go -- it occupies the

15

ground of the criteria, which go to the efficiency and

16

fairness of the process.

17

But where a State has made an antecedent

18

decision that -- that a particular cause of action or

19

a particular remedy is categorically unavailable -- or

20

ineligible for class certification, that's a decision

21

that Federal courts should respect under the Erie

22

doctrine.

23
24
25

If there are no further questions, I see my
time is about to expire.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. NELSON:

Thank you.

8

I would like to begin with the point that my

9

friend made about the "unless" clause in 901(b) and that

10

that somehow indicated that it applied only to New York

11

State statutes.

12

applied that "unless" clause to Federal statutes,

13

holding in one case that the Truth in Lending Act

14

satisfied the "unless" clause because it authorized a

15

class action, and in another that the Telephone Consumer

16

Protection Act did not because it didn't authorize a

17

class action.

18

In fact, the New York courts have

So it actually is, I think, quite clear from

19

the language of the statute and from the Court's

20

application --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There -- when you are

22

dealing with a Federal statute, there's a -- there's a

23

factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with

24

sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause.

25

If Congress has made a judgment -- let's say

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

1983 -- I don't think the State that says, for our

2

comparable claims, we don't allow class action could --

3

could apply that --

4

MR. NELSON:

I think that's right.

If

5

Congress had provided that a class action was authorized

6

in any court under a statute, New York couldn't prevent

7

it.

8
9

But my point here is that the "unless"
clause is simply consistent with the rest of the

10

statute, which makes clear that it applies to statutes

11

from any source.
And that means that far from being in the

12
13

heartland of Erie, this is far outside the heartland of

14

Erie.

15

-- or the State's legislature, for procedural reasons, a

16

balancing of the fairness and efficiency, the ­- of

17

class actions and those things that must -- that are

18

requisite to the just, speedy, and efficient --

19

It's a case where the State court for procedural

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I can't see how that's so

20

when they limit just a particular remedy or penalty.

21

they were saying, well, across the board we don't want

22

class actions, I could follow your argument much better.

23

But when New York singles out penalties, it seems to be

24

talking not about the efficiency and fairness of

25

proceedings, but that it doesn't want penalty claims to

47
Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official

1
2

be magnified.
MR. NELSON:

Well, but that's an aspect of

3

-- of the fairness and efficiency of proceedings.

4

Remember, of course, these are not claims for which the

5

plaintiffs can't recover in State court.

6

simply claims that they have to proceed individually in

7

State court to pursue.

They are

8

And the further point I would make is that

9

the judgment that the -- that the New York legislature

10

makes, that statutory penalties under any set of

11

statutes are not appropriate for class treatment, is

12

really contrary to the decision that the rules drafters

13

of Rule 23 have made, which actually specifies the

14

circumstances under which classes can be certified

15

exactly by reference to the type of relief sought.

16

So it's a case where the rule and the State

17

statute really do cover the same ground, to use the

18

approach this Court took in the Burlington case, where

19

it said that a State statute would not be given

20

effect when the Federal rule occupies the territory.

21

And that's --

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it didn't say that

about Rule 59, and it didn't say that about Rule 41(b).
MR. NELSON:

And -- and Rule 59 doesn't

occupy the territory of the standard to be applied, and

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Rule 41(b) as construed in Semtek just does not address

2

preclusive effect.
And finally, again, on the issue of ex ante

3
4

forum choice, Congress, in the Class Action Fairness

5

Act, provided jurisdiction so that Federal procedural

6

rules would apply.

7

not a case can proceed as a class action is a matter of

8

substantive right, that principle can't be cabined to

9

cases where the substantive -- or where the State

10

If, as my friend argues, whether or

standard precludes class actions.
If a class action, yes or no, is a matter of

11
12

substantive right, that applies equally to State

13

standards that -- that would promote class actions, and

14

therefore, even though as -- as my friend says, it would

15

be a Hanna issue, there would be an abridgement of a

16

substantive right.

17
18

So -- I see that my time is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can finish your

thought, if you like.

19

MR. NELSON:

Well, the thought is that

20

that's an indication that amenability to class actions

21

should be treated both for plaintiffs and for defendants

22

as a matter of procedural right governed by the Federal

23

rules.
