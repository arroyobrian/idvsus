CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument next in Case 08-728, Bloate v. United States.

Mr. Stancil.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK K. STANCIL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. STANCIL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Pretrial motion preparation time is not

11

automatically excluded under Section 3161(h)(1) of the

12

Speedy Trial Act.

13

only on a case-by-case basis under (h)(7).

14

Such delays are subject to exclusion

I would like to focus today on three

15

features of the statutory text that make that abundantly

16

clear.

17

Congress specifically addressed pretrial motion delays

18

and precisely defined that exclusion.

19

declares that the exclusion shall begin with the filing

20

of the motion and end with the hearing on or other

21

prompt disposition of the motion.

22

First and foremost, when crafting (h)(1)

Subparagraph (D)

Reading the general language in (h)(1) to

23

encompass preparation time would circumvent the

24

deliberate legislative choice to limit the pretrial

25

motion exclusion.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

prosecutor's time to be excluded, right?

3

that it starts -- the trigger is the filing of the

4

motion, and it ends when the motion is disposed of.

5

the prosecutor might say, I need additional time, and

6

that would be included in the suspension period, right?

7

MR. STANCIL:

That would allow the

Yes, Your Honor.

On your theory

So

The

8

government's motions and the defense motions are treated

9

equally under (h)(1), which is why the government's rule

10

to treat defense motions, or defense requests for

11

additional time differently -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. STANCIL:

14

But I'm -

The exclusion -- I'm sorry,

Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. STANCIL:

Yes.

The exclusion begins with the

government's motion.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Shouldn't we be

looking JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One point that I would

24

like you to clarify.

I -- I understand you to take the

25

position that the interest of justice would be the route
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to take, where the judge would have to stop and make a

2

finding.

3

assuming your interpretation of (B)(i) holds, for us to

4

send the case back, or is it too late, because the

5

interest of justice finding was never made?

6

In your view, would it be appropriate,

MR. STANCIL:

It is too late because this

7

Court answered that question -- that very question in

8

Zedner and held that an (h)(7) ends of justice finding

9

cannot be supplied retrospectively on remand.

That was

10

the precise question put to this Court and it was

11

rejected by the Court unanimously.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you think it could be

13

found.

14

the judge, when is the latest time the judge could make

15

the interest of justice filing?

16

If it doesn't have to be found on the spot by

MR. STANCIL:

Zedner says that as long as it

17

is made -- or the latest it could be made is the time by

18

which the district court rules on the motion to dismiss

19

on speedy trial -- on speedy trial grounds.

20

be made in the district court up until the time the

21

district court decides the speedy trial motion.

22

not -- at least it is left open in Zedner.

23
24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it can

It does

So the result in your

case would be that the case is dismissed, period.
MR. STANCIL:

Yes, Your Honor.
6


Alderson Reporting Company

It would be

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- it would be remanded with instructions to dismiss.

2

However, the district court -- it remains for the

3

district court to determine whether to dismiss with or

4

without prejudice according to the factors specified in

5

the act.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it clear that a period of

7

time attributable to a defense request for time to

8

prepare pretrial motions can fall within (h)(7)?

9

Because (h)(7) speaks of a continuance.

Isn't that a

10

very -- wouldn't that be a very odd use of the word

11

"continuance"?

12

If you make an application to a judge for

13

time, additional time to prepare pretrial motions, do

14

you say, "I want a continuance of the date on which my

15

pretrial motions are due"?

16

MR. STANCIL:

I think that's not an unusual

17

reading of the term "continuance," yes, Your Honor.

18

think they frequently -- trial counsel will frequently

19

ask for a continuance of the date.

20

both parties agree is that that is how the courts almost

21

universally interpret (h)(7), that any time that is

22

excluded, even if it doesn't result in the moving of the

23

trial date per se, is treated as an (h)(7) exclusion.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what I think

Well, there's -- but the

courts of appeals have almost universally read
7

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(h)(1)(D), or overwhelmingly read (h)(1)(D) to apply in

2

this situation as well.

3
4

I'm sorry.

Not (h)(1)(D), but the

introductory phrase.

5

MR. STANCIL:

Yes, Your Honor, but this rule

6

wasn't confined to pretrial motions.

7

jurisdictions that follow the majority position at issue

8

here, also to my understanding use (h)(7) to exclude

9

intermediate delays before trial.

So even in those

In fact, in the

10

government's brief, the government acknowledges that

11

courts treat pretrial motion delays under either (h)(1)

12

or (h)(7), and more specifically (h)7)(B)(iv), which

13

specifically speaks in terms of preparation.

14

fact, that's still further evidence that Congress

15

specifically contemplated that preparation time would go

16

under (h)(7).

17

specifically direct district courts to consider the need

18

for additional time for adequate or effective

19

preparation.

20

And in

Both (h)(7)(B)(ii) and (h)(7)(B)(iv)

And Justice Alito, back to your concern

21

specifically with motions.

(B)(ii) specifically refers

22

to pretrial proceedings.

23

sense, there is evidence that Congress didn't think that

24

a continuance under (h)(7) would refer only to a

25

continuance of the trial date.

So I think there, in that

At least, that's -

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's my understanding.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, at the time

3

that (h)(1)(C) -- or (D) was being looked at, wasn't it

4

a fact that some circuits had reviewed the prior

5

exclusion as applying only to the date in which there

6

were actual hearings before the court?

7

MR. STANCIL:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

Yes, Your Honor.
So isn't it -- shouldn't

we be looking at what you did with respect to this time
period in light of the need that it was addressing?

11

MR. STANCIL:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the

12

Court -- and Congress did decide to expand or clarify

13

the end point and beginning point of the (h)(1)(D)

14

exclusion.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, what's wrong with

16

the logic of district courts who have ruled in this -

17

in the government's favor, that say Congress was only

18

looking at that particular part of the proceeding -

19

what related to the hearing, the filing of the motion,

20

its actual adjudication -- but they weren't considering

21

a motion by the defendant for time to investigate, and

22

that can be another proceeding?

23

Can you imagine a situation in which a court

24

grants that adjournment to a defense attorney where we

25

would reverse that finding by the court?

MR. STANCIL:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- it would seem to

4

me that if a defense attorney comes to a court and says,

5

I need an adjournment, and the Court says, you can have

6

it, isn't that implicitly a proceeding in which the

court is saying there is a need for this?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. STANCIL:

Well, the Senate did.

Pardon me.

Yes, the Senate

3

Judiciary Committee specifically considered a proposal

4

by the government no less to include preparation time,

5

and the committee rejected that proposal as

6

unreasonable.

7

which we are left to guess whether preparation time was

8

on the table.

9

unreasonable to suggest that it would be within the

10
11

I think this is simply not a case in

It was on the table and it was declared

automatic exclusion.
Moreover, I think that makes abundant sense.

12

It is not the case that simply asking for more time

necessarily means that you have some prejudice in the

14

speedy trial context, or even that the trial date

15

necessarily would move.

16

requested the extension for pretrial motions.

18

unrelated grounds.

20

false -- a red herring, if you will, for the government

21

to suggest that when the defendant asks for something,

22

it's necessarily -- it ought to be granted, fair enough,

23

but that it's necessarily going to prejudice the speedy

trial calculation.

1

I think ordinarily, these things will come very early in

2

the speedy trial -- speedy trial clock, and there will

3

be relatively brief delays.

4

reasonable to think that district courts could be

5

allowed to give more flexible preparation time to decide

6

whether to file, what to file, and then the exclusion

7

starts with the filing.

8

that abundantly clear in -- on the text of the statute.

9

And so I think it's quite

And I think Congress has made

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That would certainly

10

encourage judges who don't want to get involved with

11

making findings, which you have to do to satisfy

12

interest of justice, to just say:

13

sorry, I'm not going to let you have the clock run while

14

you -- you are asking me for a favor.

15

prepare, and the clock is going to run in the meantime.

16

Forget it.

Motion denied; I'm

You want time to

You are not going to get the extension.

17

MR. STANCIL:

I disagree, Your Honor.

18

First, I think courts will granted them when

19

necessary.

Again because it is early in the clock,

20

there won't necessarily be speedy trial -- some sort of

21

speedy prejudice to the government.

22

this means is that the court needs to put findings on

23

the record to say this is preparation time that is

24

legitimately needed, the defendant's interests here

25

outweigh the public's interest, and so I'm going to
12
Alderson Reporting Company

But moreover, all

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

grant that and I'm going to put those findings on the

2

record.

3

that's how Congress anticipated this would work.

4

I -

And I think it's clear from the statute that

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

What must the judge -

6

the judge must make a finding orally or in writing.

7

it just say, okay, I'm giving it to you in the interest

of justice?

Can

I think -- I don't believe

10

that precise question has come to the Court.

11

are very permissive in terms of how much needs to be put

12

on the record, and it's my understanding that this

13

happens quite literally every day in scores of contexts

14

where courts, as long as they make the finding, it is

15

reviewed for an abuse of discretion only and that's

16

sufficient.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But courts

So the rule that you are

18

arguing for really will accomplish nothing, other than

19

to benefit a small set of defendants who -- who got

20

pretrial preparation time in reliance on court of

21

appeals decisions saying that those could be done

22

without making explicit ends of justice findings on the

23

record?

24
25

MR. STANCIL:

No, Your Honor.

If we are

correct, the decision will have significant effect on

the public's interest.

2

has very little to gain from such gamesmanship as the

3

government suggests would be at issue.

4

a dismissal of your indictment with or without

5

prejudice, and there are no statute of limitations

6

problems -

7

In fact, an individual defendant

JUSTICE ALITO:

What you get is

Well, how is the public

8

going to benefit if all the judge needs -- presumably,

9

district judges are not granting these extensions of

10

time in situations in which they do not think that the

11

ends of justice are served by granting the extension of

12

time.

13

So what is going to be served by requiring

14

them to recite this -- to make this rote recitation on

15

the record?

16

MR. STANCIL:

First, Your Honor, it's not

17

rote.

18

consider, including and before, it says, whether its

19

20

taking into account the exercise of due diligence.

21

It specifies four factors that they have to

What this -- what putting this under (h)(7)

22

and making that process required will do is weed out the

23

very worst sorts of delays where counsel, even for the

24

defendant or the government, comes in and asks for the

25

delay without the exercise of due diligence and without
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

any showing that this is actually necessary.

2

think that's exactly what Congress was doing by not

3

putting this under the automatic exclusion in (h)(1).

4

And I

If it's automatically excluded, and there is

5

additional time granted for no reason whatsoever or for

6

something that wouldn't meet the due diligence standard

7

in (B)(iv), the speedy trial clock is effectively

8

lengthened automatically.

10

works in district courts?

In many other jurisdictions and here, there

And one of the problems -- one of the

4

fundamental problems with the government's rule that a

in there and stop the clock.

14

If you have -- say, your motions

As a practical matter, the speedy trial, the

15

70 days, it's that much longer in those districts

16

because you have got to stop the clock compared to

17

districts where, say, 21 days are ordinarily allotted.

18

Well, they may not have to stop the clock.

19

that Congress did not -

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's clear

But I'm -- I'm not sure

21

that that isn't -- that that argument doesn't cut both

22

ways.

23

MR. STANCIL:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

I'm sorry, Your Honor?
I'm not sure if that -- if

you have a district where you have five days, a very
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

short period and almost nobody can comply with it, then

2

maybe that's an argument for the government's rule.

3

MR. STANCIL:

I disagree, Your Honor.

I

4

think that illustrates the problem, because if there is

5

a -- call it an unreasonably short time period in this

6

district, the speedy trial clock only burns for four or

7

five days or a week, and then someone is going to have

8

to run in and stop it.

9

to take longer.

10

So those trials are just going

Let's assume that it takes two weeks on

11

average or three weeks on average to prepare a

12

reasonable pretrial motion.

13

jurisdictions that have that local rule, the short local

14

rule, you get two extra weeks on the speedy trial clock,

15

because you have to run in and hit stop on the clock by

16

asking for additional time.

Well, in those

17

In those districts that give you 21 days by

18

default, by contrast, that whole 21 days counts against

the 70 days.

assumption in your mathematical analysis is that there

will be a difference in the time that it takes to

21 days of preparation time by default rule, 21 days

12

will burn and then 42 days with response and ruling.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. STANCIL:

Right.

In a district that allows only

15

five days, five days burn, and then you have to stop the

16

clock for the additional 16 days of preparation, plus

17

21, plus 21.

18

is 5 days or 21 days, there is an 86-day speedy trial

19

clock in the district with the short rule and a 70-day

20

speedy trial clock in the district with the local

21

rule -- with the 21-day rule.

You end up effectively, if the difference

22

And so I think it's -- and it's clear that

23

what Congress did not want in the Speedy Trial Act was

24

these time periods to be amended by local rule

because the disposition time isn't going to be the same

5

MR. STANCIL:

That's correct.
Congress could have

If there is

MR. STANCIL:

I don't believe so, Your

3

Honor.

I think, if I understand the hypothetical

4

correctly, if a -- if we appear before the district

5

judge and the judge says exclusions or extensions for

6

pretrial motions will qualify for (h)(7), that sounds

7

like to me in an individual case a prospective waiver of

8

that defendant's Speedy Trial Act -

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Wait a minute.

If a

10

defense attorney comes in to you and says -- I'm a

11

district court judge -- I need time to prepare; granted,

12

I am excluding time under (7)(A).

13

is insufficient?

14

MR. STANCIL:

You are saying that

No, Your Honor.

If it's done

15

on a case-by-case basis, where the time is requested and

16

the continuance or the delay is granted with the (h)(7)

17

findings made either then or later, that would be

18

perfectly appropriate.

19

That's how Congress -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it's not okay for a

20

district court to say, you tell me how much or you have

MR. STANCIL:

Yes.

Under 18 U.S.C., I

believe it's 3288 and 3289, essentially gives the

12

government six months after the dismissal of an

13

indictment to reindict a defendant.

14

almost universally held that that applies -- or I

15

believe it's universally held that that applies where

16

the dismissal is based on Speedy Trial Act grounds.

17

think we are in agreement with the government that there

is not a statute of limitations problem.

is that it's not very many.

The government certainly

MR. STANCIL:

-- in a timely manner.

So I

15

think if that is the case, it's an exceedingly small

16

number, and for that matter, that would be a problem in

17

any case in which this Court reverses an incorrect

ruling.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is -- is there any

20

indication in the circuits that follow what seems to be

21

the majority rule -- that is that the clock is stopped

22

during preparation time -- that there have been

23

excessive delays, in comparison to the -- what is it,

24

two circuits who go the other way?

25

MR. STANCIL:

Not that I am aware of, Your
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Honor, but nor has there been any indication that

2

district courts in the two jurisdiction where they get

3

the rule right in our view deny defense requests for

4

additional time.

5

I think -- I think this rule will matter if

6

you assume that the average pretrial motion extension is

7

relatively modest and that the lawyers are fairly

8

reasonable in what they request.

9

you know, additional delays of a week or two weeks, but

We are talking about,

10

that is -- again, that backs right up into the

11

congressional judgment, the legislative judgment that

12

Congress made.

13

And so those trials will on average in the

14

majority of jurisdictions, I think, just take that much

15

longer to get to trial.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what is your

17

systemic concern with the -- with the government's rule?

18

The judge has to grant the continuance under either -

19

under either of your rules, and you say he has to make a

20

finding that it's good.

21

continuance would be because the attorney wants to play

22

golf or take a vacation with his kids, and that that's

23

not the cause?

But are you concerned the

24

MR. STANCIL:

Well, that -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that's what's driving

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

your concern?
MR. STANCIL:

Well, that would be -- that is

3

the most important function of (h)(7), to screen out the

4

truly unmeritorious delays.

5

to get at most of all.

6

That's what Congress wanted

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But wouldn't judges in

7

many cases do that anyway just in the course of deciding

8

whether to grant a continuance?

9
10

MR. STANCIL:

The court may -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Give -- give me the

11

consequences of ruling for the government that you see

12

that are adverse in your view.

13

MR. STANCIL:

The consequence -- ruling for

14

the government would mean that any time a defendant

15

needs any extra time, or -- or we would say either side

16

needs any extra time, the clock stops.

17

you need additional time for pretrial motions there is

18

no balancing.

19

And so any time

So in the routine case that is not complex,

20

where the -- where the defendant's counsel may be just

21

simply not exercising due diligence, you could ask for

22

two weeks and there is no -- there is no balancing.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

23
24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Additional time granted for preparation of
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pretrial motions is automatically excluded from the

2

Speedy Trial Act deadline for commencing trial.

3

three reasons, that time falls under section 3161(h)(1)

4

which excludes delay resulting from other proceedings

5

concerning the defendant.

6

For

First, Section (h)(1) excludes delay

7

resulting from various listed proceedings and other

8

proceedings that are analogous or ancillary to those

9

proceedings.

A court's grant of additional motions

10

preparation time is ancillary to pretrial motions

11

themselves, which are a listed proceeding.

12

facilitates the motions because adequate time to prepare

13

them is critical to their fair and accurate resolution.

14

The exclusion is similar to other excludable delays that

15

result from proceedings ancillary to listed proceedings.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

Could I ask a

17

specific date question?

18

exclude the time from September 7th to October 4th?

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, the time from

September 7th to October 4th.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

doesn't -- I'm not sure that makes much sense.

23

24

pretrial motions was September 20.

25

was filed and granted, the hearing date was October 4th.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that
Before

After the extension

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So the only period of delay that you could say resulted

2

from the extension was from September 20 to October 4,

3

or 13 days.

4

Well, how can you possibly count the time as

5

a delay after he filed his extension up to the point

6

when things would have been due anyway?

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the delay is just the

8

time that's being used for preparation, which was

9

presumably the time all the way up to the period at

10

which the waiver of the intent to file motions was

11

filed.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but how is

13

that a -- how is the time being spent for preparation a

14

delay, when some of that time was going to be allowed

15

anyway?

16

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think the act -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, the

18

motions were not due until September 25th.

19

see how the time he spent before then can be regarded as

20

a delay.

21

MR. ROBERTS:

So I don't

Well, that's -- that's a

22

result of the fact that the act doesn't exclude the time

23

before a routine deadline for filing the motion, because

24

it only excludes the time -- the delay resulting from an

25

individualized proceeding.

But it makes sense not to
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exclude the -- the time before the routine deadline as a

2

general matter, because if you excluded all that time,

3

then you -- the result would be that the basic deadline

4

of the act would be extended and time would be excluded

5

in cases where no time was being used for consideration

6

or preparation of pretrial motions.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

provisions of the act.

excludes delay resulting from any proceeding to

determine mental competency.

If you take (h)(1)(A), that

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

And under your

theory that would include the time from the filing of

that motion to the end of the determination of mental

19

competency, right?

MR. ROBERTS:

I think courts have excluded

21

from the filing of a motion seeking an examination, yes.

You could also, that would probably be excluded under

23

(h)(1)(D) -

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Well, or -- yes ---no, I'm looking at (h)(4).
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Ah.

Well -- yes.
Now

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(h)(4) excludes any period of delay resulting from the

2

fact that the defendant is -- is mentally incompetent.

3

MR. ROBERTS:

Right.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me

5

redundant if you exclude the delay from the examination

6

and then also exclude mental incompetence.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think so, Your Honor,

8

because the delay resulting from the examination would

9

-- would be excluded from the order granting the

10

examination until the examination was complete.

11

then there would be a determination of competence or

12

incompetence.

All right.

let's look at (h)(1)(G).

agreement.

which prosecution is deferred pursuant to a written -

19

allowing the defendant to demonstrate his good conduct,

20

which sounds an awful lot like a plea agreement to me.

21

That excludes delay resulting

But then (h)(2) says any period of delay in

that's -- that that's a different -- a different

25

negotiations.

It's not for the court's

It's saying we're going to take time out
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

so that the defendant can demonstrate his -- his good

2

conduct.

3

I think that the plea agreement provision is

4

once the parties have proposed an agreement to the

5

court, the court has time to consider whether it should

6

approve that and that time's excluded.

7

courts have excluded the time that the parties are

8

engaged in plea negotiations as ancillary to that

9

provision of consideration of the proposed plea

10
11

And in fact

agreement.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If I disagree with

12

you that, when the time that is extended before a

13

hearing on the pretrial motions and the acceptance of a

14

waiver, which runs from 13 days, September 20, the

15

original date, and the date that it actually took place,

16

which is 13 days, and if I think, contrary to your

17

submission, which is that the whole time from the filing

18

of the extension to the final hearing is delay, even

19

though it was only 13 days that was pushed back, then

20

you lose, right?

21

MR. ROBERTS:

I'm not sure.

If you think

22

that the -- that there's delay that results from the

23

grant of the extension, I don't think that the

24

Petitioners ever challenged the length of the delay that

25

was excluded, so the only issue that's before the Court
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is whether that delay is excluded.

2

I don't know that the Petitioners preserved

3

any argument about the length of the delay, Your Honor.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Putting aside what

5

Petitioners may or may not have argued, if I think that

6

the delay is only how far the date for consideration of

7

a motion and acting on the motion has been moved -- in

8

this case, from September 20 to October 4; in other

9

words, it's 13 days, not 28 days -- then you lose,

10
11

right?
MR. ROBERTS:

I'm not sure that we lose.

12

have to confess that I haven't calculated the -- the

13

exact amount of time that that results.

14

there are other periods of delays -

I

In any case,

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

would be, take 15 days from what time you have

17

calculated, and that's -- that's under the wire -- or is

18

it above the wire?

19

MR. ROBERTS:

Yeah.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess it

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
In other words, I am

21

contesting 15 of your days, and you figured out how much

22

days you think can be excluded or not excluded.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

Right.

I guess I would say,

24

if there was some question about the length of delay,

25

the appropriate thing would be to -- to rule for us on
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the issue that's before the Court, remand to the courts

2

below, allow them to decide whether the Petitioners

3

preserved the question about the length of delay and

4

what the effect is on a rule that would only limit the

5

additional delay.

6

You know, we also have other arguments for

7

the fact that we think that, even if this time isn't

8

excluded, that, based on -- based on the additional

9

preparation time, that there's still no Speedy Trial Act

10

here, that we raised in the -- in the brief of -- in

11

opposition, and we would think that that should be taken

12

into account on any remand like that as well.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

second point you just made, Mr. Roberts?

15

the clock is running, you would still have an argument

16

that you come within the 70 days because?

17

MR. ROBERTS:

What was -- what was the
That, even if

Because the -- on

18

September 25th, Petitioner filed a notice of intent to

19

waive pretrial motions, and then there was a hearing on

20

that on the 4th, and so that filing would be analogous

21

to a motion or a motion that would trigger it's own

22

delay, that it would trigger it's own exclusion of time

23

even if the time starting on September 7th was not

24

excluded.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just for my -- just for my

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

information, what's a motion to -- to waive?

2

why does he need permission to waive?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

I mean,

The -- the court had

4

originally said -- the court had originally provided in

5

its order that on the deadline for filing motions the -

6

the Petitioner should either file the motions or

7

indicate whether he wanted to waive the motions and then

8

set a hearing on either one, on the 4th, and that's what

9

happened.

10

After he filed that paper on the 4th, the

11

court held a hearing, and the defendant -- discussed

12

with the defendant personally whether he wanted to waive

13

his right to file motions.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. ROBERTS:

I see.

And the defendant waived his

16

right to file motions, which had a consequence, you

17

know, in the case.

18

The second reason that the additional time

19

granted for preparation of pretrial motions is

20

automatically excluded is that the exclusion in Section

21

(h)(1)(D) for delay resulting from pretrial motions

22

themselves excludes the time that a court grants the

23

non-moving party to prepare a response.

24

And, as Justice Ginsburg, in her questions

25

suggested, it would make little sense automatically to
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exclude time granted to respond to motions, but not the

2

time granted for the specific purpose of preparing them.

3

In fact, this Court employed similar

4

reasoning to that in the Henderson case when it held

5

that the Act excludes the time after a court has held a

6

hearing on a motion while the court's awaiting further

7

written submissions.

8
9

The Court reasoned that it would make no
sense not to exclude that time because the act excludes

10

all the time before the hearing, as well as 30 days

11

after a motion's taken under advisement; and likewise it

12

would make no sense not to exclude time that is

13

specifically granted to prepare motions when the Court

14

excludes the time granted to respond to them.

15

Third -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Except for the -- for the

17

language, which -- which says that you -- you time it

18

from the beginning of the time granted.

19

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, section -- Section

20

(h)(1), Your Honor, expressly states that it excludes

21

delays, including, but not limited, to the listed

22

delays, so no negative inference arises from the fact

23

that the listed examples don't specifically address

24

delays resulting from the grant of additional motions

25

preparation time.
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Section (h)(1)(D) is addressing a related,

2

but different delay, the delay from the pretrial motion

3

itself.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what's the effect of

5

that language then?

Why didn't (D) just read "delay

6

resulting from any pretrial motion"?

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Because Congress specifically

8

amended it in 1979, in response to previous

9

interpretations by some courts that had excluded only

10

the time that was spent in actual court hearings, and

11

the language makes clear that all the time from the

12

filing of the motion through the hearings, including

13

the -- not just the Court hearing time -- is excluded,

14

and it -- the language continues to -- to make that

15

clear, even if preparation time is also sometimes

16

excluded.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, do you disagree

18

with your adversary, that there is no statute of

19

limitations problem if we rule against you?

20

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

I don't think that there

21

are statute of limitations problems, Your Honor, but

22

requiring judges to make superfluous ends of justice

23

findings -

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But is it superfluous?

Because what your adversary is saying is that Congress
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wanted district courts to think about why some things

2

were being -- additional time was being requested.

3

all motions by defendants would a district court

4

actually feel were warranted and might say to that

5

individual if they came in:

6

you three weeks; that should only take you a week.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Not

Look; that shouldn't take

Well, a court should always be

8

doing that in considering whether to grant additional

9

time that's requested, Your Honor.

Neither the

10

defendant nor the public is going to have an interest in

11

rushing to trial without adequate time to prepare -

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that doesn't answer

13

my point.

Without a requirement that the judge actually

14

has to make a finding in the interest of justice, once

15

the defense attorney comes in and says, I want a month,

16

and isn't the judge required to give him the month

17

because it's automatically excludable?

18

What, otherwise, forces the judge to look at

19

the request and say, no; is it really in the interest of

20

justice for me to give you that month?"

21

MR. ROBERTS:

The -- the judge doesn't have

22

to give him the additional time.

Presumably, the judge

23

should only give him the -- the additional time if more

24

time is needed to prepare the -- the motions, based on

25

the justification that the defendant 38

additional requirements are we imposing on the judge

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, what -

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If the judge always has

6

to listen to the reason, weigh it, determine whether or

7

not it is in fact in the interest of justice or not, how

8

much more burden are we putting on a judge than to say,

9

look, you are right, you need a month; I will exclude it

10

under (7)(H).

11

MR. ROBERTS:

The judge has to specifically

12

consider all of the specified factors that are in (b)(1)

13

through (4).

We have never required

So if the judge didn't go

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. ROBERTS:

I guess -- I

guess not, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you,

21

Mr. Roberts, to comment on your opponent's argument that

22

you are creating a rule that if a particular district

23

has a standing order that motions be filed after seven

24

days and then another district has a standing order that

25

it be 21 days, the effect of your rule would be to make
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the seven-day district an 86-day -- give them 86 days

2

under the Speedy Trial Act?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- the

4

act just doesn't operate so that -- so that all the

5

districts' excludable delays are even across districts.

6

The exclusion in Section (h)(1)(D), the exclusion for

7

pretrial motions, excludes the time that's allotted to

8

prepare responses.

9

the different districts in the time that's allotted to

10

And there is wide variation among

prepare responses.

11

So, for example, the Northern District of

12

Florida gives 14 days after the motion.

13

District of Illinois gives ten days after the motion.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. ROBERTS:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The Northern

That's for response time.

For response time.
And that's automatically

17

excluded, so that won't affect the -- well, like you

18

said, it's -

19

MR. ROBERTS:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

MR. ROBERTS:

22
23

same issue.

It's going to be different.
Yes.

So it's the same -- it's the

They're just -- it isn't in lockstep.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if the difference is

24

specifically authorized by Congress?

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, this is specifically
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authorized by Congress, too, because section (h)(1) is

2

-- is a general exclusion for delay resulting from

3

proceedings concerning the defendant.

4

And, you know, these are -- the list of

5

things are examples only.

6

proceedings and other proceedings, including those that

7

like this one that are ancillary to the listed ones.

8
9

And this covers those

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But doesn't it seem fairly

clear that the district which has a 21-day rule, they

10

won't have to -- normally, they won't need extra time in

11

the routine case for an extra motion, whereas the

12

districts with a seven-day rule would pretty

13

automatically need another 10 days or so.

14

MR. ROBERTS:

I think it depends on the

15

particular case and what motions are in -- or what

16

motions are involved, Your Honor.

17

But the -- the rule is going to operate

18

differentially, too.

Under Petitioner's theory, people

19

come in asking for different extensions of time to get

20

(h)(7) continuances, which Petitioner says are not going

21

to be very difficult to get granted.

22

in terms of the response time varying and in terms of

23

the rule having the same effect, whether it's excluded

24

under (h)(1) or (h)(7), I'm not sure that you are going

25

to ever get a complete parity.

So I think, both

That's really not what

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

Congress was intending.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, this may be

3

the same question I was asking earlier, but I want to

4

make sure I've got your answer.

5

date for filing motions is, as it was here,

6

September 13th, right?

7

asks for additional time.

8

runs a tight ship, and he says, I will give you one day.

9

One more day, so now it's due on September 14th.

10

Let's say the original

On September 7th, Mr. Bloate
So the judge's, you know,

You would say the delay resulting from that

11

extension was seven days, from September 7th, when he

12

filed it, to September 14th, and not one day.

13

MR. ROBERTS:

That's the way the courts have

14

interpreted it, because once the -- once the

15

determination has been made that there should be time to

16

prepare a response, then you know that you're outside of

17

the case where you don't know whether any of this time

18

in the routine deadline is being used for response -

19

for consideration of motions or preparation of motions.

20

You know that counsel is using time for that purpose.

21

But I would say, you know, the same answer

22

back to you, that -- that the issue here is whether

23

additional time should -- is excluded when it's granted.

24

The issue isn't how much time should have been excluded.

25

And if -- if the court thinks that an incorrect amount
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of time has been -- was calculated as excluded, I think

2

that the appropriate thing to do in that circumstance

3

would be for the Court to leave that open on remand,

4

assuming that it's -- that it's preserved.

5

know, I think that -- that -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, you

And you would argue it

7

wasn't reserved because both sides thought the period

8

was from September 7th until October 4th, and one

9

thought that that whole period should be excluded?

That

10

was your position, and then the other side said none of

11

it -

12

MR. ROBERTS:

That's right, Your Honor.

I

13

--

Petitioner never argued, at least as far as I am

14

aware, that the error was a miscalculation of the amount

15

of time, rather than the exclusion of the time under the

16

wrong statutory provision.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

How -- how do you think it

18

should work?

Now, what the judge did is excluded

2

everything from September 7th all the way to

3

October 4th.

4

not sure I agree with it, but on the 7th to the 13th,

5

that really wasn't additional time, but nonetheless,

6

maybe there's something there.

7

And if I understand your argument -- I'm

What about the period from the 25th to the

8

4th?

I don't know what the theory could be on excluding

9

that one, because what the defendant said on the 7th -

10

on September 13th, he said, "Judge, I don't want any

11

more time.

I don't even want to file any motions."

12

MR. ROBERTS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

that.

On the 25th.

MR. ROBERTS:

As I was saying before, what

17

-- he did make a filing on the 25th, and the Court took

18

action in response to that filing on the 4th, by holding

19

a hearing at which he waived the motions as he indicated

20

that he was doing on the -- on the 25th.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -

So the delay -- so

22

saying I'm not going to file any pretrial motions

23

results in a delay from a pretrial motion?

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, in this particular

instance, Your Honor, he made a filing and then the
45

Court -- the Court held a hearing in response to that,

2

and actually engaged in a colloquy with the defendant,

asked the -- asked the defendant, "Do you understand

4

what you are giving up?

5

motions?"

8

Do you want to waive these

He said, "Yes, I want to do that," and the

12

It does seem to be typical in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But then the Court's

13

view a decision or statement that no motions are going

14

to be filed as a request for a waiver of that

obligation?

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, it was in fact a waiver

18

filed.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- they made it very clear

3

here that they think it applies to both the defendant

4

and the government.

5

MR. STANCIL:

If that's their position, it's

6

more unmoored from the text of subparagraph (D), because

7

then both types of requests -- so subparagraph -- pardon

8

me -- so (h)(1)'s general standard is expanded even

9

farther -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

You are right, (D) has a

11

special time limit built into it -- I mean, (h) or

12

whatever the number is now.

13

30 days.

It says not to exclude

Okay?

14

MR. STANCIL:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

None of the others do.

So

16

I would say right there, Congress doesn't want the judge

17

to have it for more than 30 days.

19

preparation time.

Well, I disagree about

from other proceedings?

2

(D), okay?

3

because, in fact, the preparation time is a direct

4

result of the other proceedings as defined in (D).

5

Therefore, it is an ancillary matter related to other

6

proceedings that was caused by the other proceedings.

7

QED, their argument is literal and there is no policy

8

against it.

9

Yes, we know that because of

That's what they said.
Now, as soon as you get to the last (h), you

Yes,

But there is no At least my interpretation

of it.
MR. STANCIL:

There is no difference, Your

17

Honor, between not exceeding 30 days and from and to.

18

And I think this is -- this case -- it comes to that and

19

that alone, which is Congress specifically addressed

20

pretrial motions, any delay resulting from a pretrial

21

motion and it said from point A to point B.

22

you had to look behind that, you would look at the

23

legislative history and the Senate Judiciary Committee

24

was asked a specific question by the government no less,

25

can we include preparation time, and they said no.

Counsel, is your

friend correct that the issue of the proper calculation

is not before us?

that out should be excluded from something?

So that the time I spent figuring

(Laughter.)

6

MR. STANCIL:

As the question was presented,

7

Your Honor, it was specific to preparation time and the

8

period -- and the period from -- I don't want to get the

9

dates wrong but, September 7th to October 4th.

But I

10

would add that the government didn't raise this argument

11

below, either.

12

understand it, that the delay that's at issue here

13

results from the grant on September 7th of additional

14

time.

15

understood it when reading their briefs is that the

16

delay -- the ancillary delay stems from the pretrial

17

motion, the time allotted for pretrial motions itself.

Nor did the government suggest, as I

Rather their argument as I have understood it and

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

19

that whether or not you think that type of delay is

20

excludable depends on what that type of delay is, which

21

requires some sense of how it's going to be calculated.
