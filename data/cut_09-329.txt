We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 09-329, Chase Bank v. McCoy.
Mr. Waxman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAXMAN:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented is how to interpret a

10
11

since-amended version of Regulation Z.

12

filed, solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court,

13

the Federal Reserve Board has confirmed that it has long

14

interpreted its regulation just as Chase Bank and the

15

rest of the regulated credit card industry understood.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In amicus briefs

Mr. Waxman?

Yes, Justice Kagan?
Can I ask you about the

19

deference that we should give to the briefs that have

20

been filed in the First Circuit and the invitation brief

21

in this case?
Auer deference seems pretty four-square with

22
23

this.

It's a brief that was filed to interpret an

24

agency regulation.

25

continues to remain good law after Christensen and Mead.

But I'm wondering whether Auer

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

In Christensen, the Court held -- and I quote -

2

"Interpretations such as those in opinion letters -

3

like interpretations contained in policy statements,

4

agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which

5

lack the force of law -- do not warrant Chevron-style

6

deference."

7

And Mead said pretty much the same thing.
So it seems to me that there are three

8

possibilities for why Auer remains good law.

9

that briefs are somehow different from all those other

10
11

One is

things that we talked about in Christensen.
Another is that an agency gets more

12

deference when interpreting regulations than when

13

interpreting its own statutes -- something that I think

14

I just don't quite understand, but maybe you could

15

convince me of it.

16

And a third is, well, look, they're just

17

basically inconsistent, but Auer was Auer, and we don't

18

feel like overruling cases, and we're not so sure we got

19

it right in Christensen and Mead anyway.

20

So, which is it?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. WAXMAN:

A lot of the above.

First of all, Auer has been

24

applied in the context of amicus briefs since

25

Christensen and Mead, both -- unanimously both in
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Kennedy and in Long Island Care at Home.

2

say, in both of those cases, the deference was to a

3

brief that acknowledged a change in the agency's

4

position, which is quite unlike what's going on here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

And I must

Absolutely right, Mr.

6

Waxman, but in each of those cases it was basically a

7

sentence or two.

8

conflict between Auer and Christensen and Mead.

We never really addressed the possible

MR. WAXMAN:

9

Nonetheless, I think those

10

cases stand for the proposition that Auer is alive and

11

well.

12

both Mead and Christensen and the passage in Christensen

13

that you're referring to dealt with the question of

14

Chevron deference to informal letters from the -- from,

15

you know, a -- somebody who was employed by an

16

administrative agency.

And, in any event, as your question pointed out,

And the question in the case, the

17
18

interpretive question in the case, in the Chevron

19

context, is:

20

has, in fact, delegated to the agency interpretive or

21

rulemaking authority in this context?

22

example, in Mead, the Court distinguished between

23

notice-and-comment regulations that Customs put out, as

24

opposed to the kind of determinations that were made by

25

46 different offices at the rate of something like

What confidence can we have that Congress

5
Alderson Reporting Company

And so, for

Official

1

15,000 letters a year.
In the -- when Christensen dealt with the

2
3

Auer question, because it did involve a -- an informal

4

opinion of the Wage and Hour Administrator both

5

interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act and a

6

regulation, when it came to interpreting the regulation

7

what this Court said is:

8

here because we read the regulation as clear.

9

of course, made clear that deference is due to an agency

Our deference doesn't apply
And Auer,

10

brief unless it is plainly erroneous or the regulation

11

is clear.

12

Now, here we have a situation in which it is

13

not an agency staff or whatever that is applied.

14

First Circuit asked the government for -- solicited the

15

Federal Reserve Board itself to explain the meaning of

16

its own regulation.

17

represented that it was the longstanding and consistent

18

interpretation of the Federal Reserve Board -

19

The

And the brief that was filed

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, I take it

20

from this whole discussion that you are recognizing that

21

this is not a crystal-clear regulation; there is some

22

ambiguity, and that's why we are talking about how much

23

deference we owe to the agency.

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

That's correct.

We think that

the Federal Reserve Board's reading of the two
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

regulatory provisions is the better reading, but we

2

acknowledge, as every court I think that has -- that has

3

addressed this, that there is some ambiguity, just

4

looking at the regulations.
But I think it's important to understand

5
6

also that the views expressed in the amicus brief

7

solicited by the First Circuit and by this Court are

8

entirely consistent with explanations that the Board, as

9

a Board, provided in the course of a 4-year rulemaking

10

process about what these provisions mean.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

So you think the same

12

deference is owed to ANPRs as to the amicus briefs?

13

What is your position on that?
MR. WAXMAN:

14

I -- I think that if it weren't

15

for the amicus briefs in this case, which are later in

16

time and address the very specific question that is

17

presented in this case, our deference would be

18

appropriate.
And it's not just an ANPR.

19

There was the

20

Federal Reserve explanation accompanying the ANPR, a

21

functionally identical explanation accompanying the

22

proposed rule, and one also accompanying the final rule.

23

And those explanations of the Board are entitled to Auer

24

deference.

25

After all, in Anderson Ford, another case
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

involving the construction of Regulation Z, this Court

2

acknowledged that deference was due to a proposed -- the

3

commentary accompanying a proposed change in Regulation

4

Z which had not in fact even been implemented.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -

Of course, I suppose -
Judge Cudahy in dissent

7

relied very much on the advance notice of proposed

8

rulemaking.
MR. WAXMAN:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10
11

I'm sorry?

Judge -

Judge Cudahy in dissent

relied -- put considerable reliance on the ANPR.
MR. WAXMAN:

12

Yes.

And in fact,

13

Justice Kennedy, I would say that both the majority and

14

the dissent below referred to the ANPR when -- both when

15

they were referring to the commentary to the ANPR and

16

the commentary to the actual proposed rule in 2007.
Now, of course, Judge Cudahy was deciding

17
18

this before the First Circuit had solicited the views.

19

On rehearing, we urged the Ninth Circuit to solicit the

20

views of the Federal Reserve Board if there were any

21

doubt, because a split had been created, but it declined

22

to do so.

23

And -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose, having done it

24

twice before, we could in this case apply Auer without

25

explaining why it is that Auer is not inconsistent with
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mead, right?

2

here.

We did it twice before; we could do it

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Sure.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Or -

Absolutely.

Or you could -- you could

6

explain that it is not in any way inconsistent with

7

Mead, because Mead -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

That's a lot more trouble,

though.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. WAXMAN:

To be sure, but you granted

12

plenary review in this case.

13

underscore -- I'm not trying -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. WAXMAN:

And I do -- I just want to

Why "to be sure"?

I'm not trying to be flip here.

16

I don't think that there is any inconsistency between

17

Auer and Mead.

18

not there was -- the Court could be confident that

19

Congress had delegated some sort of lawmaking function

20

to these letters that were written by Customs officers

21

across the country to individual importers, when the

22

letters themselves made clear that they couldn't be

23

relied on by anybody other than that particular importer

24

and only unless and until the Customs officer changed

25

her mind.

Mead involved the question of whether or

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Mead did put a lot of

2

emphasis on procedural formality.

3

Justice Scalia sort of snidely, but I think accurately,

4

described Mead as saying:

5

through 'adjudication[,] notice-and-comment rulemaking,

6

or...some other [procedure] indicat[ing] comparable

7

congressional intent [whatever that means]' is Chevron

8

deference applicable."

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

So, you know,

"Only when agencies act

So, you know -
I don't -

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This is -- this is not an

11

adjudication.

12

and it's hard to see why there is some procedure here

13

indicating comparable congressional intent, as Mead was

14

-- would require.

15

It's not a notice-and-comment rulemaking,

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Kagan, with respect to

16

the Mead question, which is a Chevron question, the -

17

the Board's explanation in -- published in the Federal

18

Register in 2004, and again in 2007, and again in 2009,

19

is a formal explication of the Board's rules pursuant to

20

its very, very broad rulemaking authority under the

21

Truth in Lending Act.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course, you can also

23

read Mead and decide what it says.

Being in the

24

majority, I thought the dissent's characterization was

25

not what it said.

I mean, the dissent -
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. WAXMAN:

I -- I don't think there's -

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

The dissent can write what

3

it wants to write.

But I don't think that that was what

4

Mead said, but I guess there's disagreement about that.

5

What did you think?
MR. WAXMAN:

6

Given my chosen line of work,

7

it may be meet for me not to inject myself into this

8

debate, but -
(Laughter.)

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

No, no.

But I -- I'm

11

sorry.

You're an informed reader, and I -- I thought

12

Mead definitely did not say that.

13

dissent's characterization of what it said.
MR. WAXMAN:

14

That was the

Giving the dissent its full

15

weight, I had understood both the majority and the

16

dissent to explain that notice -- the existence of

17

formal notice-and-comment rulemaking is an important

18

indicator -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21

-- one indicator of

congressional delegation of rulemaking authority.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. WAXMAN:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

That is one indicator.

But not exclusive.

But not exclusive.
Mr. Waxman, why are we

getting into all of this, because there's no question in
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this case that the Federal Reserve Board had authority

2

to issue Regulation Z?

3

authority Congress gave to -- to the Board.

There's no question about what

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Correct.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- and the only

6

question is:

So -- so the Board adopts Regulation Z,

7

and then a question comes up, what does it mean?

8

surely the Board that wrote the rule is first and

9

foremost the proper interpreter.
MR. WAXMAN:

10

Right.

Well,

As to -- I agree with

11

that.

And, as to why we're getting into all this, you

12

know, I had a prepared statement that actually was going

13

off in a different direction.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Not in the sense that I'm

16

disagreeing with the Court, but the point that it seems

17

to me -

18
19
20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is not new to

you, is it, this method of proceeding?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

So I think the -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do I understand -

23

before you move in the direction you'd like to, I

24

understand your view to be that Chevron and Auer apply,

25

and it's consistent with Mead because you have more
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

indications that Congress delegated this authority to

2

the Board than you -- than were present in Mead?
MR. WAXMAN:

3

That's correct.

And I think,

4

you know, to the extent that there's anything more

5

that's needed, it seems to me the icing on the cake here

6

is that the rulemaking that I've been discussing during

7

which over the course of several years the Board engaged

8

in consumer testing, in surveys, in comments, and

9

decided to change its regulation -- it produced as what

10

it called a, quote, "major change," an entirely new

11

section of Regulation Z, 226.9, that establishes as a

12

new requirement what the Respondent in this case

13

erroneously ascribes to the previously unamended text.

14

And that is -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Well, I do think -- I do

16

think, counsel, that that major change doesn't have to

17

be the way you describe it.

18

either contemporary notice and/or 15-day notice versus

19

45 is a significant change.

The difference between

20

MR. WAXMAN:

That's correct, and it's -

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so it doesn't need

22

to have been precipitated solely by a decision that the

23

old rule, if it's as your adversary advocates it, didn't

24

exist.

25

MR. WAXMAN:

I -- I agree, Justice
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Sotomayor, that that -- that one of the two changes that

2

the Board made could be characterized and was, in fact,

3

a major change.

4

pages, the Federal Register record cites that we've

5

provided on page 29, note 7, of our blue brief, and that

6

the Federal Reserve Board's amicus brief in the First

7

Circuit provided at page 12a of the Government's brief,

8

I think you will see that what the Board -- the Board in

9

2009 was very careful to explain, as it did in 2007,

10

But if the Court will take note of the

that it was making in this respect two major changes.
One is that in those instances in which the

11
12

contract was being changed, that is a term of the

13

contract was being changed, advance notice of 45 days

14

would be required regardless of what kind of change it

15

was, but that when there was an -- a rate increase,

16

quote, "due to delinquency, deficiency, or penalty, not

17

due to a change in contractual terms of the consumer's

18

account," reference should be made to new subsection

19

(g).

20

that it was making two different changes:

21

the advance notice period with respect to changes in

22

terms from what the original disclosure provided; and

23

another to provide that if you are increasing the rate,

24

even if it is entirely consistent with the initial

25

disclosures, you are required by this new subsection to

And the Federal Reserve Board was very, very clear

14
Alderson Reporting Company

one to extend

Official

1

provide advance notice.
JUSTICE ALITO:

2

May I ask you a question

3

about how the contract works in the situation in which a

4

cardholder is found by -- was found by Chase to have

5

defaulted by failing to make some payment other than

6

payment on the Chase credit card?

7

guess from information obtained from a credit agency,

8

that the cardholder has failed to make payments to

9

someone else on time, you conclude that the cardholder

10

So you determine, I

is in default, you increase the -- the interest rate.
How is the -- the cardholder, knowing,

11
12

thinking that he or she has made all Chase payments on

13

time, is not going to be alerted to the fact that there

14

may be an increase in the rate.

15

cardholder going to realize what has happened, just by

16

scrutinizing the monthly statement and seeing that the

17

little interest figure is different from what it was the

18

last time?

19
20

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

So how is that

And now, of course, we're

talking about a rule that's -- it had been amended -

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, I saw that.

-- amended 2 years ago, but

23

under the old regime the cardholder was on notice -- I

24

mean, there had to be -- and the Reg Z commentary was

25

clear that in order for it to be a default rate, it had
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to specify in the initial disclosures both the precise

2

triggering event, that is, what constitutes a default -

3

and here there's no doubt that it was specified that

4

what constitutes a default is a default or failure to

5

make a payment to any creditor -- and there also has to

6

be a specification of the maximum rate that could be

7

applied as a result.
Now, in this case, as the Board explained,

8
9

the -- the consumer would be notified in the next

10

monthly statement -- and it is pretty prominent -- that

11

the interest rate applied to all balances for that month

12

was as follows.

May I save the balance of my time?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE,
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

2

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

3
4

MR. PALMORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
During the relevant time period, the Federal

5
6

Reserve Board's Regulation Z did not require provision

7

of a change-in-terms notice when a credit card issuer

8

merely implemented a contractual penalty rate provision

9

that had already been disclosed.

This is clear from the

10

staff commentary to the rule, from the Board's own

11

statements in the Federal Register when discussing

12

changes to this very rule, and finally from the amicus

13

briefs filed by the Board in the First Circuit and in

14

this Court.
I think it's important to put the particular

15
16

regulatory provisions here in a larger context because

17

the policy question at issue here, whether there should

18

be advance notice under these circumstances, is not new.

19

It did not arise with this litigation.

20

subject of intense regulatory focus at the Board since

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I do.

This is, of course, not

8

subsequent disclosure -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10

There's no provision in the Truth in
The

Our Long Island

health care case?
MR. PALMORE:

11

It's an -- it's an Auer case,

12

and we believe that all of these provisions, certainly

13

the staff commentary deserves deference, and that was

14

the holding of this Court in Milhollin, in the Milhollin

15

case.

16

in rulemaking proceedings about what its old rules meant

17

certainly deserve deference, and we believe the amicus

18

briefs do as well.

But also the Board's own authoritative statements

19

In 2004, it was -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you know, we don't -

21

we don't do that with Congress.

When -- when a later

22

Congress says what a statute enacted by an earlier

23

Congress meant, we don't -- we don't retroactively say,

24

well, that must be what it meant.

25

examples of where the Board says what a prior rule meant

Are there other

MR. PALMORE:

2

Well, this Board -- this

Court, of course, in Long Island Care at Home deferred

4

to an internal advisory memorandum that was -- that was

5

provided after the court of appeals decision that was at

6

issue.

7

change in policy.
In the context of Auer deference, when

8
9

That was an after-the-fact reading, and it was a

you're looking to the author of the agency's regulation

10

to elucidate what that regulation has meant -- means,

11

the Court has looked at a broad range of material

12

because it understands that, when Congress delegates

13

rulemaking authority to an agency, that it also as an

14

adjunct to that delegates authority to interpret those

15

rules.

16

Mr. Palmore, what would the

a card issuer says when any of 50 different things

5

happen, so 50 different triggering events, the -- the

6

issuer can raise the rate anywhere up to 300 percent, so

has complete discretion if any of a quite large number

of triggering events occurs.

Would there need to be notice for that?

Would that have to be -- and then it implements that

Would the cardholder have to have notice of

MR. PALMORE:

5

Yes.

Under staff comment

9(c)-1, the staff makes clear that if there's a general

7

-- exercise of a change in rates pursuant to a general

8

reservation of rights clause that's not specific with

9

respect to the maximum rate that could apply or the

10

specific triggering events that could lead to imposition

11

of the maximum rate, that advance notice is required.
But the staff contrasted that to the

13

situation we have here, when the specific change is

14

previously disclosed, and it provided some examples, the

15

third of which is quite analogous here.

This statement by the Board authoritatively

interpreting its rules is inconsistent with the court of

appeals' view of those rules.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

Could you address

14

your friend's contention that because the notice doesn't

15

occur -- the notice that the increase has gone into

16

effect doesn't occur until the end of a billing cycle,

17

it's a retroactive increase without notice.
MR. PALMORE:

18

It's a retroactive increase

19

without notice that was specifically disclosed

20

initially.

21

here on page 20a of the petition appendix, Chase was up

statement and others like it as incidental descriptions

of current law.

The court of appeals tried to dismiss this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

But it is correct to

10

characterize what's being allowed under your

11

interpretation as an increase in rates without notice?
MR. PALMORE:

12

Without advance notice.

There

are actually two kinds of notice under the old rule.

to be disclosed initially.

It had to be disclosed

22

initially, and if the cardholder didn't like the term,

5

if not, what's the -- what was its reason for

interpreting the Regulation Z the way it did?

7

MR. PALMORE:

And

I think it's important to note

8

that in 1981, as we discussed earlier, there was no

provision in the Truth in Lending Act requiring

subsequent disclosure at all.

statute at that time and in the Board at that time was

12

on the importance of initial disclosure.

13

thought that initial disclosure was the key tool that

14

consumers could use to comparison shop for credit.

15

the Board wasn't as focused on things that happened

16

later in that credit arrangement.

17

the initial disclosure and the subsequent disclosure was

18

sufficient, in the same way that, in a variable rate

19

plan, there's initial disclosure of the variable rate

20

and there's subsequent disclosure on the periodic

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. BECK

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. BECK:

8
9

The

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether a bank

10
11

must provide notice of a change in terms when, after

12

prominently disclosing a specific purchase rate in the

13

cardholder agreement, the bank then changes that rate -

14

then changes that rate based on a reservation of

15

discretion in the fine print of the cardholder

16

agreement.

17
18
19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Changes the rate in the

cardholder's favor?
MR. BECK:

Changes the rate -- the rules,

20

the regulations, as they -- as they exist as relevant to

21

this case, provide that you do not need to provide

22

notice if the interest rate is reduced.

23

question, Justice Ginsburg?

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that your

Yes, but would you -

would it be in the greater interest of your client if
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the initial notice said we're going to raise it to the

2

top, no discretion?
MR. BECK:

3

It -- there -- Justice Ginsburg,

4

there would still be discretion.

5

nothing we say would take away discretion or discourage

6

discretion.

7

credit card company has to decide specifically what rate

8

will apply beforehand and put it in the cardholder

9

agreement, or it can specify a range of possible rates,

10

reserve that discretion, and then when it decides which

11

rate it wants to apply, it would then inform the

12

borrower what that rate is.

13

And we're not -- and

We're simply saying that either the -- the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if it says:

We

14

prefer one notice to two.

So, sorry, we can't give our

15

cardholders that benefit.

We'll say this is the rate,

second notice.

18

MR. BECK:

Then we will spare ourselves a

Right.

And -- and there's -- but

19

there has been no showing that the -- this notice cost

20

would be -- would be a significant burden on the credit

21

card companies.

22

don't know, if you don't get that notice and all you

23

know is that the credit card company has discretion to

24

raise the rate, then you never know for sure whether

25

your rate has even gone up or not, much less how much

And the important thing is that, if you

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's gone up.

2

and see whether there's a better-priced loan available.

3

You might not -- you might miss an opportunity to avoid

4

making a purchase that would -- that would be at a rate

5

higher than you expected, and the lack of that -- that

6

ability to shop between loans is really the central

7

motivating -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8
9
10

So you never have that opportunity to go

Well, you know the

highest rate, because that's stated in the original
notice, and you could shop on the basis of that.
MR. BECK:

11

You -- you could, but you

12

wouldn't know that the rate had gone up at all, because

13

all you know is that there's a maximum rate, and the -

14

and the credit card company has discretion to raise the

15

rate or not.

16

be that the rate hasn't changed, that there's -

17

So absent any notice, the assumption would

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you get the notice

18

with your next statement.

19

purchases made before the next statement, right?

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. BECK:

But you're talking about the

Right.

You -- you don't get

notice on your next statement, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
your rates changed.
MR. BECK:

Well, you get notice if

It would show it, wouldn't it?
It will -- it will state, Your

Honor, it will state on the statement that -- what your
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rate is.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. BECK:

Right.

But it will not tell you that the

4

rate has changed, and it won't tell you how much it has

5

changed.

6

So it's not notice of a change in that sense.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

7
8

So you'd have to figure that out by yourself.

What's to figure out?

I

mean -
MR. BECK:

9

Well -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

If he had been paying,

11

what, 10 percent and it's now 25 percent, it would seem

12

evident on the face.

13

of the purchases that you have made before you got that

14

statement.
MR. BECK:

15

But that doesn't solve the problem

Well, that's right -- that's

16

correct, Your Honor.

17

problem.

18

back to the beginning of the cycle, so this would go

19

back to the first of the month even before the default

20

occurred, as happens in this case, then the problem is

21

exacerbated even more.

22

It still doesn't solve that

And when the rate is applied retroactively

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Beck, just to clarify

23

your position, if the initial agreement said your rate

24

is 10 percent, but if you're delinquent, your rate will

25

be 20 percent, so not up to 20 percent, just 20 percent,
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's an automatic increase in your rate -- in that case,

2

would notice -- would subsequent notice be required?

3

MR. BECK:

I think if the disclosure was

4

specific and -- and prominent, as required by the

5

initial disclosures, and it wasn't retroactive, then I

6

think the best reading of the rules would be you would

7

not need to disclose that.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9
10

So if you don't need to

disclose this -- and I think that this is the import of
Justice Ginsburg's question -

11

MR. BECK:

Right.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- what's the difference

13

between going, okay, we'll do the initial agreement, 10

14

percent to 20 percent; then we can always lower the rate

15

without providing notice; we'll go back down to

16

12 percent, and now you have a 12 percent rate.

17

the difference between doing that and, on the other

18

hand, doing what the card issuer said here, which is if

19

you're delinquent, we have the discretion to go up to 20

20

percent, but, you know, we could also go to 12?

21

MR. BECK:

What's

Well, the easy answer to that

22

question is that it -- it's different because the

23

language of the regulation specifies a different result

24

in each case.

25

is required when any component of the finance charge

Section 226.9(c)(2) says that no notice

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decreases or is changed in the customer's favor.

2

there would be under the plain language of the

3

regulation no need to -- to provide notice there.

4

So

But I think the intent of the question is,

5

is Chase's argument about there's no practical

6

difference between the two, that is, there's basically

7

no harm from -- from not telling people that the -

8

about their rate change.

9

well, first of all because, as I was saying to Justice

And we disagree with that as

10

Ginsburg, you need to have the notice that there has

11

been a change at all in order to -- to realize that you

12

might want to avoid making extra purchases or

13

consider -- not throw away the low APR offer that comes

14

in the mail, for example.

15

And also, aside from that, we think that

16

when you have only a -- a maximum rate, that's basically

17

the equivalent of a range of possible rates between the

18

initial rate and the maximum rate.

19

the ability to compare loans at the time of the

20

cardholder agreement, even before the whole default

21

comes into play, because at that point you have to

22

compare two loans with two possible ranges of rates, and

23

the key factor between the two, the value of the two

24

loans, is how the credit card company will issue -- will

25

use its discretion in -
31
Alderson Reporting Company

And that undercuts

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's just

2

saying that the problem that Justice Ginsburg is

3

concerned with isn't likely to come up, because a credit

4

card issuer realizes he's not going to get chosen by a

5

consumer if he says your rate is going to be somewhere

6

between 5 and 20 percent.

7

that card.
MR. BECK:

8
9

No one's going to sign up for

Well, that's -- that's part of

the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, because the point of -

10

the central motivating purpose of TILA is to provide

11

clear and up-front and specific disclosures, and that -

12

that would put the burden on the consumer to -- to look

13

into the fine print to figure out the conditions, and

14

after judging all the applicability of those conditions,

15

to figure out how it would apply and compare with other

16

loans.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it's fine to say

18

then, Federal Reserve Board, this regulation that you

19

had and that you explained a number of times was a bad

20

one; you should change it, which they did.

21

up against a regulation that both sides say has some

22

ambiguity, but that the Board has said what it meant a

23

number of times.

24

new rule is much better so we're going to say that

25

that's what the old rule was as well, in the face of

But you are

MR. BECK:

Ginsburg.

No, definitely not, Justice

But -
JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Why not?

Can't an agency

5

interpret its own rules?

I thought there was a long

6

line of cases, Udall v. -- whatever it was.

7

there are like 50 of them -

8

MR. BECK:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean,

Yes.
-- where an agency can

10

interpret its own rules, and if it has authority to make

11

the rule, it can decide that it means something

12

different.

13

say they can't do that?

14

Why not?

MR. BECK:

Where -- where in the law does it

It doesn't, Justice Breyer, and

15

-- and all we're saying is that agencies speak with

16

varying levels of authority, and -- and those different

17

methods of statement make a difference in how much

18

deference will go towards those statements.

19

have here is the official staff commentary which the

20

Board has designated as the official source of -- of

21

interpretation of the rules, and we're asking the Court

22

to -- to read those rules and defer to those.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And what we

But at the Board -- I mean,

24

isn't there realism in this?

When you read what the

25

Board later said in -- in these reports, you'd say,
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

well, is this what the Board now thinks?

2

the law prevents the Board, which is in charge of its

3

own regulations, from telling us what it thinks, if it's

4

in good faith and isn't making up some kind of ex-post

5

rationalization?

6

brief case.

7

And what in

That's the word used, you know, in the

MR. BECK:

I think that the Board itself

8

made that law when it decided that it would issue

9

official staff commentary through a notice-and-comment

10
11

process and interpret the rules in that way.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the problem with that

12

is in the Ninth Circuit split about the official

13

statements, and Judge Cudahy gave a very cogent

14

explanation of why the majority just is dead wrong in

15

how it read those official comments.

16

on what two judges have said the official interpretation

17

was, against the dissenting opinion and the Board itself

18

saying that's what we meant in our official comments, in

19

our official comments.

20

MR. BECK:

So you're relying

Well, we -- we think that Justice

21

Cudahy's analysis made the same mistake that other

22

courts have made in examining the regulations, which is

23

to defer to the -- the unofficial statements of the

24

Board, the Board or the Board's staff, before coming to

25

a conclusion about the plain meaning of the official
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

regulations, the official interpretation.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

And what about the

invited brief in the First Circuit?
MR. BECK:

4

Well, there's no question that

5

the invited brief is against our position, and we

6

certainly wouldn't argue otherwise.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

But -

You talk about the plain

8

meaning or -- I thought you agreed that the -- that the

9

regulation is ambiguous.
MR. BECK:

10
11

No, we don't agree that the

regulation is ambiguous.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

MR. BECK:

I thought you did.

And I'd like to talk about that.

14

Section 226.9 is the relevant change-of-terms provision,

15

and it states that notice is required, quote, "whenever

16

any term required to be disclosed under section 226 is

17

changed."

18

there is a required disclosure when -- "of each periodic

19

rate that may be used to compute the finance charge."

20

And section 226.6 in turn states that -- that

And so those two sections working together

21

say that you have to -- you have to disclose when

22

there's a change of terms and -- and that one of the

23

terms that has to be disclosed is the interest rate.

24

And, in fact, the interest rate is the most important

25

disclosure -

JUSTICE SCALIA:
that may be charged -

MR. BECK:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the rate -- the rate

That still remains what it was.
MR. BECK:

6

All right.

But I don't think the

7

word "may" here can be read to exclude the requirement

8

that the bank also disclose the rates that are charged.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Ah.

No, you're the one

10

that's reading it to say something different from what

11

it says.

12

14

It says the rates that may be charged.

MR. BECK:

15

That's

That term

You want to change it to "the

16

20

specificity.

21

both rates that might be applied and rates that are

22

23

Everybody agrees that that

So the word "may" has to include the -

And the reason the word "may" has to be

24

there is because it's quite possible that a -- that a

25

rate may never come into play.

For example, if you have

36
Alderson Reporting Company

1

an initial rate that changes at the end of 6 months and

2

you leave the credit card before the 6 months are up,

3

then that new rate will never come into play.

doesn't mean you don't also have to disclose the rate

a horse race, and that brings us back to how much

9

deference you give to the -- to the Board.

MR. BECK:

Uh-huh.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I -

You're trying to make the

argument that it's clear.

charged" alone makes it unclear, it seems to me.
MR. BECK:

14

The fact that it says "may be

Well, I would say that even the

15

Government doesn't -- doesn't agree with that, that

16

"may" means that.

17

doesn't argue initial disclosures don't have to be

18

specific and don't have to be -- don't have to be made.

Because that would -- the Government

The Government's argument is a little bit

19
20

different.

What they're saying is that the word "term"

21

in section 226.9 means contractual terms rather than

22

credit terms.

23

it doesn't -- it wouldn't -- it wouldn't affect the

24

initial disclosures.

25

mean that you don't have to give subsequent notice if

And that's a different argument because

It would only -- it would only

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

you haven't changed the contract in the first instance.
And so these are actually somewhat -

3

somewhat different theories.

And under the Government's

4

theory, there would be no role for section 226.9 to play

5

because you would -- the only times it would come into

6

play is when there's a change in the contract.

7

time there's a change in the contract, under the basic

8

contract law of every State, you have to provide notice

9

at least to the other party to the contract.

And any

So the

10

only time notice would be required under section 226.9

11

would be when the -- when contract law requires that

12

notice to be given anyway.

13

And even worse than that, it would -- it

14

would actually cut back on the required notice that

15

would be available under contract law, because, for

16

example, Delaware says you have to give 15 days' advance

17

notice of a change in terms to a credit card agreement

18

in the event of a default.

19

would -- even if the creditor changed the terms of the

20

contract, as in increased the default rate above the

21

maximum that the contract would authorize, so the

22

contract says we can charge you 30 percent in the event

23

of a default and you impose an interest rate of

24

100 percent -- then even in those circumstances, you

25

only have to provide contemporaneous notice of the

And under this reading, you

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

change.

So you would basically have to put a letter in

2

the mailbox on the day that you implement the new

3

100 percent interest rate that was not disclosed in the

4

initial agreement.
And our submission is that that's not a

5
6

reasonable interpretation of section 226.9.

And it is

7

true that the rules have been amended, but we have to

8

look at the purpose of the rules from the point of view

9

of the -- of the Board which enacted those rules in

10

1981.

11

expected a set of rules that would never -- that would

12

never require subsequent notice to be -- to be supplied

13

unless there is a change in the terms of a contract, in

14

which -- in which notice would have to be required

15

anyway.

16

And you can't assume that the Board at that time

The next point that the parties -- aside

17

from the language of the -- of the regulation itself,

18

the parties rely on the official staff commentary, as do

19

we, in supporting their position.

20

that the word "specific" allows them to -- I'm sorry -

21

the Government and Chase Bank argue that the word

22

"specific" allows them to specify in advance only the

23

maximum rate and that the word "specific" encompasses a

24

maximum and the circumstances of causing that maximum to

25

go in effect of a universal default situation, where if
39
Alderson Reporting Company

And the parties argue

Official

1

you default to any creditor or make a late payment to

2

any creditor, then it triggers the new rate, which goes

3

up to a discretionary maximum.
It's our contention that that kind of

4
5

situation of a universal default and a discretionary

6

maximum rate is not a specific disclosure under any

7

sense of the word.

And -

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

what was my initial question.

So we're getting back to
So you say you can't have

10

flexibility that would favor the cardholder.

11

initial notice is to count, then it has to be a fixed

12

rate and the company can't exercise discretion to reduce

13

the rate.

14

would be okay.

15

provided flexibility to reduce the rate in the interest

16

of the cardholder.

17

That's what you're saying:

If the

A fixed rate

The problem with this is the company

MR. BECK:

That's one of the problems.

18

other problems are that the triggering event is not

19

specific enough and that it applies retroactively.

20

The

But, as to that problem, which we -- we do

21

agree is a problem, that's a result of the Board's

22

decision to allow reductions in interest rates without

23

requiring notice.

24

that there's no point in giving a specific interest rate

25

because it could always, after all, be lower -

And if it were true that that meant

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't say "specific

2

interest rate."

I mean, my understanding of it -- and

3

I'm asking, so you can correct me if that isn't so -- is

4

there's a regulation, Regulation Z.

5

MR. BECK:

Right.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then the staff put out

7

some commentary and says here's what that means, among

8

other things:

9

at its discretion, and you've got to give notice.

That the creditor can increase the rate
You

10

have to give notice, but you have to give some more

11

notice if the original notice does not include specific

12

terms for an increase.

13

And then they give an example.

Suppose the

14

increase could occur under the creditor's contract

15

reservation right to increase the periodic rate.

16

MR. BECK:

Right.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's a little obscure.

18

As I say it, I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

19

then, later on, the Board puts out another -- not called

20

official staff commentary, but they say:

21

what that specific -- word "specific" terms mean.

22

means when they didn't say anything about the interest

23

rate or they didn't say when in fact they were going to

24

increase the interest rate from X to Y, then they didn't

25

give specific notice.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

So

We'll tell you
It

Official

But they did give specific notice if they

2

told you when it would increase, by default -- when you

3

default.

4

told you what the maximum it would go up to was, like 8

5

percent or 18 or whatever it is.

6

Board's interpretation of its official staff commentary,

7

which in turn is an interpretation of the reg.

And they did give specific notice when they

So that's the

So if we're supposed to defer to their

8
9

Okay?

interpretation of their own reg -- I mean, my goodness,

10

wouldn't we defer like double to their own

11

interpretation of their own staff commentary, which is

12

an interpretation of a reg which they have an authority

13

to issue under the -- you see my point.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. BECK:

I see your point, Justice Breyer.

16

But I would say that when you're talking about an

17

interpretation of an interpretation, you're even further

18

away from the original congressional intent that's

19

empowering these kinds of interpretations.

20

think that would -
JUSTICE BREYER:

21

So I don't

I mean, that would be an

22

argument you could make.

You could say that -- that

23

their interpretation here exceeds their authority under

24

the statute.

25

that, all this stuff goes out the window.

Now, of course, if you're right about

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. BECK:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Right.
But it's a pretty hard

argument to make that one, I think.

4

MR. BECK:

And we're not making that

5

argument, Your Honor.

6

that when you look at the interpretation, you have to

7

judge it based on the authority that comes with it and

8

the deliberation that comes with it.

But what we are saying is -- is

And in this case, we know that the Board

9
10

itself has designated the official staff commentary with

11

notice-and-comment process as the way that it wants to

12

officially interpret rules.

13

that, because the Board was concerned, as Congress was

14

concerned, that there was all these differing

15

interpretations of the -- of Regulation Z that were

16

going out in the form of opinion letters.

And there's good reason for

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

What's left of your

18

arguments if we decide that the statute is ambiguous,

19

the official staff commentary is ambiguous?

20

left?

What's

Is Auer deference then required?

21

MR. BECK:

I think -- I think Auer -

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

To -- to the amicus

23

brief at least?

We can talk about whether the ANPRs or

24

the unofficial commentaries are -- are due deference.

25

But what are we left with if we think there is
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ambiguity?
MR. BECK:

2

I think in that case that the

3

Court would have to defer to some degree to the brief,

4

because that would be the only source of the Board's

5

opinion in that case.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6
7

falls on whether we believe that the statute is clear?
MR. BECK:

8
9

So your case rises and

The regulation and the official

staff commentary.

10

But I would also say that that deference

11

does not have to be conclusive, and it should not be

12

given the force of law, even to the brief, because the

13

agency has said that it doesn't -- it specified the

14

official staff commentary so that there aren't these

15

multiplicity of different opinions going out,

16

interpretations of Regulation Z that are difficult for

17

banks to access to figure out what their obligations are

18

under the regulations.
And -- and so the Board itself doesn't want

19
20

opinion letters and briefs and things to be -- to be

21

interpreted as -- with the force of law, because that

22

would, you know -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

Well, that's a different

24

question.

You're claiming that the Board's regulations

25

supersede whatever deference Auer would otherwise give
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to amicus briefs?
MR. BECK:

2

Yes.

I think that's right or at

3

least limit that deference.

4

should at least -- should at least view the brief with

5

more skepticism, given that the Board has wanted this

6

very careful deliberative process for making its rules.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

I think that the Court

Mr. Bauer, if -- most of

8

your argument seems to rely on the official staff

9

commentary, but the official staff commentary itself

10

seems to me to cut against you.

It says no notice may

11

be -- need be given if the specific change is set forth

12

initially.

13

means.

14

the consumer has been under an agreement to maintain a

15

certain balance in a savings account in order to keep a

16

particular rate and the account balance falls below the

17

specified minimum.

And then it gives examples of what that

And it says such as an increase that occurs when

So the example that they give is an example

18
19

where there's a triggering event and there's a penalty

20

rate that comes into effect as a result of the

21

triggering event.

And that's exactly what is true here.

MR. BECK:

22

Yes, but in that case, Justice

23

Kagan, you know for certain anyone who has a bank

24

account can know what the balance of that bank account

25

is.

And so there's no uncertainty about whether the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

balance triggering event is satisfied.

And then there's

2

no uncertainty about what the resulting rate is because

3

section 226.6 says you have to disclose each interest

4

rate and the range of balances to which it is

5

applicable.

6

and you have to know the triggering event.

7

very different from a case where you're not sure, first

8

of all, whether the bank is going to use its discretion

9

at all.

So you have to know both the interest rate
And that's

You don't know for sure whether your -- whether

10

there's anything negative on your credit report that

11

would even trigger that discretion to begin with.

12

you don't know, if the discretion is triggered, what the

13

rate will be because the bank reserves discretion to set

14

it anywhere up to the maximum.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

And

Well, on the triggering

16

event first, it's true that you might know your account

17

balance, but it's also true that you might know whether

18

you paid your bills on time.
MR. BECK:

19

What's the difference?

Well, as -- there's the

20

discretionary difference, for example.

21

the bank situation, the rate is automatic and is not

22

based -- it doesn't just trigger an exercise of

23

discretion.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:
the example that's given.

There's no -- in

Well, I don't see that in
I don't see that it limits it

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to a situation in which there is an automatic increase

2

in your rate rather than a discretionary increase in

3

your rate.

4

MR. Beck:

Well, for that, I would look to

5

section 226.6(a)(2), which says that each periodic rate

6

and the range of balances to which it is applicable must

7

be set forth initially.

8

beginning which balances on your account will trigger a

9

certain interest rate.

And so you know from the very

And so there's no -- in that

10

case, there's no uncertainty.

11

is that in the bank account situation, your balance is

12

either above the maximum or below the maximum.

13

But the other difference

But when you're talking about universal

14

default, it's not always going to be obvious to you,

15

first of all, whether anyone has reported anything to

16

the credit agency.

17

overlook a certain late payment, for example, and maybe

18

they reported one and it might not show up on your

19

Experian credit report for months or years later, and

20

then you will not know at what point it comes into play.

21

So you would -- the only way to know for sure in that

22

circumstance is to subscribe to the Experian credit

23

reporting service just like Chase does so that you would

24

know when there's any negative events that are reported

25

to the credit agency that would possibly trigger Chase's

Oftentimes, certain creditors will

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discretion, but even in that case you wouldn't know for

2

sure whether Chase had implemented its discretion or

3

not.
And I wanted to say that the -- that the

4
5

government -- its own interpretation of the regulation

6

is, especially when considering the amendment, is itself

7

inconsistent, because the government says that the new

8

regulation fixed the problem.

9

uses the same language as the old regulation when it

But the new regulation

10

comes to what's required for a -- for a later change.

11

It does carve out the default rate situation as a

12

special case.

13

that has happened subsequent to the initial disclosure,

14

it still uses as a triggering event any change in terms

15

required to be disclosed by section 226.6.

But for every other kind of rate increase

And if it were true that -- that what the

16
17

Board wanted to do was fix this ambiguity and this

18

problem that was set forth in -- that was in the

19

original regulations, then it would be very, very

20

unlikely that the government would then implement the

21

same language in the amended regulation and leave that

22

same ambiguity in place rather than clarifying exactly

23

when subsequent notice would be required.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

argument.

I'm not following that

I thought that the new regulation says now
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

any time there is a change in the rate, whether it was

2

announced originally or comes up later, just keeping it

3

nice and simple, a rate change, you send notice.

4

you've got -- and you have to do it -- give 45 days'

5

notice.

6

was.

And

I thought that that's what the new regulation

MR. BECK:

7

That's why I am saying the

8

government is inconsistent because that's what the

9

government says that it does, but what it -- what the

10

regulation actually says in 226.6(c), the new version,

11

any change required to be disclosed -- a change in any

12

term required to be disclosed by section 226.6 is the

13

same thing.

14

(g) that applies just to default rates, and it's very

15

extensive because it covers a lot of aspects of default

16

rates.

17

increases would have to be disclosed.

18

this case would certainly be resolved.

It is true that there's a new subsection

So now I think it is clear that default rate
So the problem in

19

But the Government's position is that -

20

that there was a consolidation of all change notices

21

into one 45-day notice period, and that's not clear from

22

the regulation because it still uses this same ambiguous

23

language that was in the old version.

24

Court -- the Court should -- and for us that's an

25

independent reason for the Court to view skeptically the
49
Alderson Reporting Company

So I think the

Official

1

Government's submissions in this case and to view it

2

with some skepticism instead of granting it the force of

3

law, because the Court should -- should consider that.

4

The Board itself hasn't -- hasn't adopted a consistent

5

interpretation of the language at issue.

18

19

which are also referred to as change-in-terms clauses,

disclosures.

arrangement that, you know, it may decide to change any

term in any respect at any time.

They are a term of art, as the Board has

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

regulations make clear that if you do that, that is if

2

you implement a change in terms pursuant to a

3

reservation of rights clause, you have to provide

4

notice.
Now, the specific -- what "specific" means

5
6

in the commentary to the regulation, which is a question

7

that Justice Kagan asked, it seems to me was absolutely

8

explained by the Board in a 1998 amendment to Regulation

9

Z, which is comment 6(a)(2)-11, which is reprinted in

22

you would have to give another notice?

23

MR. WAXMAN:

You have to -- I

24

mean, what it says -- and I'm quoting from, like,

25

four-fifths of the way down page 8 -- quote:
51

"If the

1

initial rate may increase upon the occurrence of one or

2

more specific events, such as a late payment or an

3

extension of credit that exceeds the credit limit, the

creditor must disclose the initial rate and the

5

increased penalty rate that may apply."

6

amendment in 1998 that the Board made to Reg Z in what

7

it recognized, what it stated was on account of the

8

increased use of default penalty terms in the initial

9

disclosures, that it wanted to make clear that if both

And this was an

10

the triggering event and the maximum rate was specified,

11

there would be no change in terms if an increased rate

12

were implemented.
And finally, I just want to address my

13
14

friend's point that there may be some question about

15

whether TILA even authorizes the Board's explanation of

16

the type of subsequent disclosure that was or wasn't

17

required and underscore Mr. Palmore's observation that

18

in TILA until 2009, there was a requirement for initial

19

disclosures, there was a requirement for periodic

20

statements, but nothing at all about subsequent

disclosures.
