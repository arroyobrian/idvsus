ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10
11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you,


Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case presents a stark choice between

12

two plausible definitions of the phrase, "lawfully made

13

under this title."

14

consistent with the English language, and is the only

15

definition that does not do mischief with the same use

16

of that phrase each time it's repeated.

17

Our definition is the more

Ours is the only one consistent with a

18

400-year common law history, and 65-year-old right that

19

was in the statute through 1976, and consistent with the

20

principle that Congress doesn't abolish those things

21

without being clear.

22

Ours gives the copyright owners much of what

23

they asked for when they were seeking an importation

24

provision, just not everything; whereas, Wiley's grants

25

them rights far beyond anything that anyone could have
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

imagined asking for back then.

2

Ours --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your reading -- your

4

reading is essentially, once a copy is sold anywhere,

5

the copyright owner loses control of distribution

6

everywhere.

7

That is essentially your argument.

8
9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:
Your Honor.

That is correct,

And to put a finer point on it, ours is

10

that "lawfully made under this title" means made

11

wherever, in a way that satisfies U.S. copyright

12

standards, made in accordance with --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- but -- so this

14

notion of sold anywhere, end of distribution rights

15

everywhere, that has been called, I think, the universal

16

exhaustion principle.

17
18
19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

International exhaustion.

Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we are told that no

20

country has adopted that international exhaustion

21

regime, that most countries adhere to the national

22

exhaustion regime, which nobody is contesting here.

23

That is, if it's manufactured in the United States and

24

sold in the United States, that copy belongs to the

25

person who purchased it, end of case.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

But if the

Official

1

exhaustion doctrine applies only nationally, then your

2

argument is asking for something that runs against the

3

regime that is accepted in most places.

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, I have a few

5

answers to that.

6

country adopts national exhaustion.

7

national exhaustion in sections 905 and 906 6 years

8

after the statute was passed, as to microchips.

9

The first is it is not true that no
Congress adopted

But second, Wiley is making the point that

10

there is now a norm.

11

countries, that is.

12

arguing that there was any international norm, much less

13

that the drafters of the statute were focused on

14

international norms; and the truth is that there isn't

15

an international consensus around national exhaustion.

16

We know that for a fact.

17

together, they -- they agreed to disagree on

18

international copyright exhaustion principles, and they

19

codified that disagreement, to each his own, in the

20

TRIPS agreement.

21

They say most States -- most
Back in 1976 Wiley is not even

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor, not to


3

quibble; they don't follow national exhaustion.

4

follow regional exhaustion.

5

They


So --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but not -- not

6

exhaust -- you sell a copy in -- in Thailand; then it's

7

home free all over the world.

8
9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Agreed, Your Honor, but it

is regional, it's not national.

And -- and the point

10

here is we've got to of course read what Congress wrote.

11

What Congress wrote was "lawfully made under this

12

title," not "lawfully made in the United States," or not

13

"lawfully made under this title and made in the United

14

States."

15

that very explicitly.

16

When Congress wants to say that, Congress says

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you mean by "lawfully

17

made under this title," simply lawfully made in a manner

18

that does not violate United States copyright law?

19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

Just, I --

20

I would say "lawfully made under this title" means

21

lawfully made in a manner that does not violate the

22

standards articulated.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The standards, okay.

So --

24

so it could be lawfully made in England, let's say; in a

25

country that has compulsory licensing, it could be
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lawfully made there, but it would not be lawfully made

2

under our -- under our copyright law, because we don't

3

have that.

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

Let me

5

give a -- an example that actually is consistent with

6

what --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So -- so at least they are

8

correct in contending that what you are arguing for is

9

-- is not lawfully made under -- lawfully made if the

10

United States copyright law had applied where it was

11

made; is that what you are saying?

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No?

15

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

-- that that statute that

13

And the

reason is --

16

you just described would only do a third of the job of

17

the first-sale doctrine.

18

doctrine applies at a minimum to products made in the

19

United States.

20

U.S. law had applied, it would indicate that it, the

21

first-sale doctrine, does not apply in situations where

22

it was made in the United States.

23

counterfactual --

24
25

Everyone agrees the first-sale

And if you use that counterfactual, if

So the

I don't -- I don't follow

that.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So the first-sale doctrine

applies to goods made in the United States --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

-- and to goods made

5

outside of the United States, is our argument.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

If it applies in the United

8

States, if we're talking about goods made in the United

9

States, the counterfactual "if this title had applied"

10

would not work, because this title does apply to the

11

goods made in the United States, and that's the core of

12

the first-sale doctrine.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Rosenkranz, is

14

what -- is your theory of this statute essentially that

15

this language means non-piratical copies as that is

16

defined by U.S. copyright law?

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor, if I may

18

just change one word, because "piratical" is a

19

mischievous word.

20

1976 statute was passed, "piratical" meant unlawful

21

under the laws of other countries.

Back in the day when the -- when the

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Absolutely.

And -- and the

key --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So that's, that's what the

4

statute means.

It's -- the statute in your view is

5

setting up a distinction between piratical, pirated,

6

whatever the term is -- copies --

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and other copies, and

9
10

Counterfeit.

saying that that distinction should be measured by U.S.
copyright law?

11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That is right.

And Your

12

Honor, the reason was -- what was driving copyright

13

owners crazy was this notion that there were lawless

14

states out there that had no significant copyright

15

protection.

16

products that were infiltrating the U.S. market.

17

one of the most important things to underscore here,

18

which I think got lost in the Costco argument, is that

19

the space -- that 602 does an enormous amount of work

20

even with 109, the first-sale doctrine, carved out of

21

it.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Rosenkranz, can I

2

ask you, just -- it is a practical question, but I think

3

it has a theoretical impact.

4

to contract or a copyright holder choose to contract

5

with someone here to manufacture their goods.

could contract with someone abroad, anywhere in the

world, directly.

12

this title," does "lawfully made under this title" apply

13

to all of those situations, i.e. --

In your definition of "lawfully made under

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

the manufacturer who manufactures abroad --

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- I think clearly to

Yes.
-- clearly to the

19

manufacturer who licensed a distributor to do it for it.

20

But does it also apply to the -- to the copyright owner

21

who basically gives the copyright to a foreign

22

distributor and lets the foreign distributor -- register

23

it abroad?

24
25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

The only

question under our definition is, was the making lawful,
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which is to say, was it authorized, whether it's by

2

transfer of licensing or by transfer of copyright or in

3

any other way?

4

standards?

5

Is it lawful as measured by U.S.

And -- and the -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That is -- that is

6

broader than I thought.

Then I'm not quite sure why you

7

don't mean if this title applied.

8

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because if the --

If --- the manufacturer who

10

is manufacturing under the English copyright, because

11

the distributor has an English copyright, is not

12

manufacturing under the U.S. copyright, they are

13

manufacturing under the English copyright.

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Right.

And, Your Honor,

15

the reason that the language works the way we've

16

described is because we are not focusing on whether the

17

making was under this title; we're focusing on whether

18

it was lawful under this title.

19

title, when you apply it to wherever it happens to be,

20

whether in the United States or abroad, would this title

21

say that this is authorized?

22

Does this -- would this

Now, let me just circle back again.

The

23

reason if this title had been applicable doesn't work is

24

because there are enormous numbers of situations,

25

probably three-quarters of them, that the First Sale
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Doctrine applies to where this title does apply.
And so trying to say where -- you know, if

3

this title had applied would work for foreign goods

4

coming in, but not for U.S. goods, which is the core of

5

the First Sale Doctrine.


6

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you don't have to


7

say -- you can say both, either it was manufactured


8

directly and received an American copyright and


9

satisfied all the conditions, or, if that wasn't the


10

case, it was manufactured in a way that satisfied the

11

conditions of the American statute, even though, for

12

technical reasons, it didn't apply.

13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

And, in

fact, (a)(2) -JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what your argument

is, I take it.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

In 2008 --

So we are off on a kind of

curly cue here.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

But -- so

21

what Congress did was to find a much simpler, more

22

efficient way to say all of that.

23

In 2008, it figured that out and put --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

I take it that the reason

they wrote -- or changed the statute was just because
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they were worried about bailees or lessees or somebody

2

under the old statutes not satisfying the first -- they

3

were worried about that -- somebody -- a printer

4

lawfully obtains a book, and he shouldn't have advantage

5

of the First Sale Doctrine.

6

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

He's in the middle of

8

9

language.

10

And therefore you have to change the

So they changed the language to "lawfully

made under this title."

11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Correct.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Am I right; or, if I am

13

wrong, why did they change it?

14
15
16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:
right.

Your Honor, that is exactly

And just not to diminish it -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it all right?

Wasn't

17

there also the question of allowing manufacturers to

18

segment markets so we'd have the copyright by abroad,

19

governed by foreign law, copyright in the United States

20

governed by U.S. law?

21

allowing people to do just what these people are doing?

22

Wasn't segmentation of the market

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So, Justice Ginsburg, my

23

answer to Justice Breyer was about why the language in

24

109 was changed, that is, from "obtained possession" to

25

"lawfully made."
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And that was -- what Justice Breyer pointed

2

out was exactly why, because -- and not to minimize

3

bailees, bailees was the movie industry problem.

4

Bailees was stealing things from the manufacturers'

5

loading docks or from shippers.

6

there was also a segment of the publishing industry that

7

wanted that third thing.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But, yes, Your Honor,

I couldn't find a word.

I

could not find a word of that in the legislative

10

history.

Irwin Karp, who was the strongest

11

representative for the publishers, said you couldn't do

12

that ten years earlier.

13

So is there --

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but you just said yes

16

in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.

17

find exactly what there is there, so I would like to

18

know what it is.

19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So she'll

Your Honor, I -- I was

answering yes to was this a motivation of the

21

publishers.

Honor --

25

And if I misunderstood the question, Your

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

A motivation for 602.

When the conversation turned to 109,

2

Your Honor, not a word was uttered about dividing

3

distribution or divided markets.

4

problem --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It was all about this

So on 602, you said that one

6

of the things that they wanted was the segmentation of

7

markets.

8

distributors' half.

They got half of it.

9

They got the rogue

And I guess Mr. Olson makes the point, and

10

it seems a good one, it's like that's a crazy half to

11

have gotten.

12

because they have a contractual remedy about -- against

13

the distributors.

14

That's the kind that they don't need

And then they don't get people like,

15

frankly, your client, who are rogue something elses,

16

with no contractual privity.

17

make?

18

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And what sense does that

Well, it makes perfect

19

sense, Your Honor.

20

at least back in 1976, did not get everything that they

21

wanted.

22

than a contract.

23

Obviously, you know, the industry,

What they got was a much more powerful weapon

I mean, a copyright weapon gives you

24

injunctive relief, gives you multiples of damages which

25

you don't get out of a contract remedy.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But to Justice Breyer's point, because I

2

think it's an important one, when you go to the

3

history -- and I think you are right, Your Honor, that

4

there is exactly one spot in the drafting history where

5

the relationship between 602 and 109 was discussed.

6

was that conversation between Clark and Goldman, who was

7

the general counsel of the copyright office.

8
9

It

It's on pages 11 to 12 of our reply brief.
It's recited in extensive detail in the amicus brief

10

that Costco submitted.

11

got their importation provision.

12

wait a minute, I don't get it.

13

importation provision, and you've got this First Sale

14

Doctrine.

15

wins?

16

And here's what happened.

They

And Karp says, now,
You have got this

They are at war with each other.

Which one

They seem to be agreeing that first sale

17

wins, but they realize that there is this problem.

And

18

what they do, the general counsel of the copyright

19

office says, we obviously haven't thought this through.

20

We need to do more work on this, says the librarian of

21

Congress.

22

in a red line on page 13 of our reply brief, is that for

23

the first time in the drafting history, the two are

24

reconciled by making 602 subordinate to 109, in exactly

25

the way that Quality King found it to be.

And the next thing that happens, you see it

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So the copyright owners got half the loaf.

2

It may not have been the half that was more important to

3

them, but they got a lot more from the extension of the

4

-- the importation provision.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rosenkranz, there is


6

that passage in Quality King, which is, I think it's


7

fair to say, unfortunate to your position.

8

basic view of that passage that it was simply


9

ill-considered dicta that we should ignore?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

10
11

That's my ultimate position.

12

reconciled with our position.

Is your


To put it bluntly, yes.
But I do think it can be

13

Let's start with the question presented in

14

Quality King is exactly the question that is presented

15

here, and the Court answered it yes, that is, do

16

imports -- is 109 applicable to imports.

17

The whole driving logic of Quality King is

18

about 109 trumping 602.

19

where the court is rebutting various attacks on its

20

position, that it gets to that dictum, and that dictum

21

is in the third tier explanation to one of five

22

rebuttals.

23

And it's only in that part IV,

I believe it can be reconciled, certainly in

24

result.

What you had there was the foreign distributor

25

who had only British rights importing directly into the
18

United States.

2

There was never a first sale.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, in result, but not in

3

reasoning.

4

presumably not to be lawfully made under this title.

5

The passage specifically says this was

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And I have an -- I agree

6

with you, Your Honor.

I have an explanation.

I offer

7

it tentatively.

8

either as to what the Court intended or under the

9

statute.

I'm not sure whether it's right or not,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner's commercial enterprise is

10

precisely what Section 602(a)(1) was enacted to address,

11

an international gray market in copyrighted works.

12

Court unanimously recognized in the Quality King case

13

that 602(a)(1) encompasses copies of books that were

14

lawfully made not under the United States' Copyright

15

Act, but under the law of some other country.

16

602(a) is broader than 6 -- 109(a), because

17

it encompasses copies not subject to the first-sale

18

doctrine, for example copies made under the law of

19

another country.

22

was going on in the Quality King case.

25

602(a), and so the Court was explaining on page 147 and

manufacturing the book in England, he's not -- because

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Olson, we know from

8

the Karp exchange that the response was, this is

9

something that we have to study with care, in 1976.

10

The parade of horribles is now causing the

11

Solicitor General and at least one, if not two, courts

12

of appeals to write exceptions into the language to take

13

care of what they perceive as horribles.

14

Isn't it incumbent upon us to give the

15

statute what is plainly a more rational plain meaning

16

than to try to give it a meaning and then fix it because

17

we understand that the meaning doesn't make sense?

for, and did use those words, one of which was written

specifically goes over each one of those, but each one
33

Alderson Reporting Company

1

of those, if you interpret the statute as under this

2

title as pursuant to this title, each one of those

3

provisions makes sense in the context in which that term

4

is used there.

5

And -- and there is only one real way to

6

interpret under this title in the provisions in 109(a)

7

in -- in conjunction with 602(a)(1), and that is the way

8

the Court decided it in the Quality King case,

9

specifically looking at this question.
Now the facts were slightly different in the

10
11

sense that that was a round trip; this isn't a round

12

trip.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I take you back to the

14

words here, "lawfully made under this title," which you

15

say clearly means what you say it means.

16

So, I find this language a little bit

17

perplexing, and I can kind of see it both ways.

18

you say is made under this title, that must mean made in

19

the United States, and "lawfully," just as this little

20

word that's -- that modifies that basic phrase, "made

21

under this title," which means made in the United

22

States.

23

So what

But what Mr. Rosenkranz essentially says --

24

he doesn't say it in these words, but he says, "The

25

focus of this provision is on 'lawfully made.'"

But the point I guess I am making,

Mr. Chief Justice, is that Congress was clearly

intending to talk about the vast gray market problem.

18

This provision --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, intending where?

I

20

mean, I -- you spend a lot of time talking about the

21

legislative history and the purposes behind 602.

22

the language that we're supposed to be interpreting is

23

the language in section 109.

24

section 109, as far as I can see, there's really nothing

25

to support your argument that that language was intended

But

And the language in

to address this gray market problem.

2

Isn't that correct?

3

MR. OLSON:

Well, no.

I think that section

4

109 and 602(a) were adopted in the same statute.

5

were put in the draft of the statute at the same time,

6

in 1964.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They

But you know, section 109 is

8

just a rewording of a prior provision that you would

9

clearly lose under, where the prior wording had nothing

10

to do with where any product was manufactured.

11

you're suggesting is that we should read this change in

12

wording -- which actually, there's a real theory behind

13

what the change in wording meant that has nothing to do

14

with the place of manufacture, that we should read it as

15

incorporating a place of manufacture requirement,

16

because there was a separate debate going on in section

17

602 about that question.

18

MR. OLSON:

And what

But the -- but the two pro --

19

what I'm -- I guess what I'm trying to explain is that

20

the two were enacted at the same time.

21

there and available to the public for 12 years before

22

they were finally adopted.

23

could have been addressed by Congress in a different way

24

at the time, and the interpretation -- this is a -- 109

25

They were out

2

So what does it mean?

What provide -- what

4

interpret, "made under this" -- "lawfully made under

5

6

And you then have to

What does that mean?
And you have done that in the Quality King

7

case.

You explained in the Quality King unanimously

8

that it makes a difference because you are exhausting --

9

Congress intended to allow segmentation of the market.

10

It only makes sense to interpret this way if you allow

11

segmentation of the market pursuant to these provisions,

12

because it is exhausting the copyright under the laws of

13

the United States once you make a sale of a product

14

produced in the United States subject to the United

15

States' copyright laws.

16

You are not exhausting your U.S. copyright

17

when you make something, or allow something to be made

18

abroad.

19

have not done that yet.

20

something that happens abroad that uses up the copyright

21

laws -- of the protection under the copyright laws of

22

the United States.

23

You are not exhausting that copyright.

So the first sale is not

So it seems to me that this does make

perfect sense.

And it makes -- there is not going to be

The Court has dealt

with that frequently with respect to copyright laws.


2

But if you interpret it as my opponent interprets it,


3

you are opening the door to commercial enterprises


4

precisely like this.


5

It's not necessary in this case to decide


6

every single permutation of a problem that someone


7

crosses a border with a product, but this section 602


8

specifically contemplates products that are acquired


9

abroad and then brought back into the United States.


10

Here, we have a commercial enterprise doing exactly what

11

is contemplated by the people who were talking about

12

602(a) and section 109 when the two were adopted at the

13

same time.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Olson, do you have an

15

answer to the outsourcing problem and the charges that

18

MR. OLSON:

There are several answers to

19

that.

20

is no evidence that that would really actually happen.

And Congress was concerned with creating a segmentation

22

of the market.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

MR. STEWART:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

I would like to discuss -- begin by

13

discussing our Bobbs-Merrill argument, because it's a

14

part of our brief that's different from both the

15

parties' submissions, and I do think it's very important

16

to understanding the practical implications of the

Mr. Stewart, may I ask

you a preliminary question?

20

government took the position that the Petitioner is

25

In Quality King the

Was it just what has been called "dictum" in

MR. STEWART:

I think there are two related

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasons, and one of them is the dictum, but I'll get to

2

that second.

3

I think in both cases, our overriding

4

objective was to offer a reading of section 109(a) that

5

would not supersede, or would not effectively negate the

6

importation prohibition in section 602(a)(1), because

7

from the Copyright Office's perspective, we agree with

8

Mr. Olson that the primary reason for the enactment of

9

602(a)(1) was to facilitate market segmentation.

10

the argument we made in Quality King was you can

11

accomplish that; you can prevent section 109(a) --

12
13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Could you point to

something in the legislative history to support that?
MR. STEWART:

I think the best thing I could

15

point to is a report of the Registrar of Copyrights that

16

was issued in 1965, in which the Copyright Office

17

identified as one of the circumstances that would be

18

covered by the importation ban, the situation in which,

19

quote, "the copyright owner had authorized the -- the

20

manufacture of copies in a foreign country for

21

distribution only in that country."

22

It didn't use the phrase "market

23

segmentation," but clearly, the point was the same.

25

43

Alderson Reporting Company

You

1

here.

2

And so --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So Mr. Stewart, if I

4

understand your argument, both here and in Quality King

5

you want the copyright holder to have some control over

6

importation, but at the same time you don't want the

7

copyright holder to have control over all downstream

8

sales.

9
10

MR. STEWART:
JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct.
And that's what your

11

Bobbs-Merrill argument is designed to do.

12

to prevent that.

13

MR. STEWART:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's designed

That's correct.
Coming back to Justice

15

Ginsburg's question, do you think that truly the way to

16

do those two things, to give the copyright holder

17

control over importation, but not over downstream sales,

18

that our problem really is, do you think in your heart

19

of hearts that we got it wrong in Quality King?

20

MR. STEWART:

Well, we lost that case 9-0,

21

and so I am not arguing too vociferously that the Court

22

should change its opinion.

23

still would adhere to our view that section 109(a)

24

should not be read as a limitation on section 602(a)(1).

25

If the Court had gone that path, it could read "lawfully

But yes, we think that we

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

made under this title" to encompass both foreign-made


2

and domestic-made copies, without doing damage to the


3

copyright holder's ability to segment markets.


4

On the other hand --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you get what you

6

wanted anyway?

7

Quality King, except that the price is that people have

8

to ship their manufacturing abroad.

9

That's really the bottom line.

MR. STEWART:

We undo

Well, we're not urging the

10

Court to take that course, but yes, that would have been

11

one way to accomplish the same objective.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so --

So you are essentially

13

saying that the appropriate way to read this statute, to

14

make sense of all of its provisions, is to give the

15

copyright holder control over the importation, to give

16

Wiley the ability to go after this importer, Mr.

17

Kirtsaeng, but to find a way to stop it there?

18

MR. STEWART:

I think that's correct, but I

19

think our Bobbs-Merrill argument does provide a very

20

principled way to stop it there without going back on

21

what the Court said in Quality King.

22

Bobbs-Merrill was a 1908 case in which the publisher

23

sold books to retailers on the proviso that they not be

24

sold at retail for less than a specified amount.

25

the retailers violated that resale restriction and was
45

Alderson Reporting Company

That is,

One of

Official

1
2

sued for copyright infringement.
And this Court in Bobbs-Merrill said --

3

parsed the statutory language, which at that time gave

4

the copyright owner the exclusive right to vend copies

5

of the work.


6

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you're saying


7

Bobbs-Merrill means something beyond section 109, but


8

when -- the 1909 Copyright Act said that it was


9

codifying the holding in Bobbs-Merrill, and the 1976


10

statute, which is now before us, said it wasn't changing

11

the meaning of the earlier law.

12

Bobbs-Merrill wasn't a constitutional decision, it was a

13

question of statutory interpretation.

14
15
16

So I don't know how --

So how does some sliver of Bobbs-Merrill
still survive all of this?
MR. STEWART:

Maybe I can put it this way:

17

If I buy a piratical copy of a book, one that was

18

illegally made without the consent of the copyright

19

owner, and all I do is read it and put it on my shelf, I

20

can't rely on 109(a) because the copy was not lawfully

21

made under this title.

22

liable for copyright infringement because there is no

23

exclusive right to read the book or to own it.

24

wouldn't have been infringing any of the copyright

25

owner's rights.

But I still couldn't be held

46

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

And so in order to have a valid claim for

2

copyright infringement, the copyright owner would have

3

to show both that 109(a) was inapplicable, and that what

4

the defendant was doing was a violation, an infringement

5

of one of the exclusive rights.

6

And Mr. Rosenkranz seems to postulate a

7

situation in which a cagey manufacturer would locate its

8

facilities overseas, make the copies there, import them

9

into the United States, sell them in this country,

10
11

subject to conditions on resale.
And if the goods were resold in violation of

12

those restrictions, the copyright owner would sue for

13

infringement.

14

defendant would make is that is exactly the conduct that

15

the Court in Bobbs-Merrill said did not infringe the

16

exclusive right to vend.

17

And I think the first argument the

Now -- namely the resale in violation of

18

restrictions on resale.

How can you now say it's now an

19

infringement of the exclusive right to distribute?

20

it would be a particularly difficult argument for the

21

copyright owner to make because what the House Report

22

said in 1909, it didn't say exactly that it was

23

codifying the holding of Bobbs-Merrill; it said that it

24

was amending the statute in other respects, and it

25

wanted to make clear that there was no intent to enlarge
47

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

the exclusive right to vend.


2

And so the Plaintiff, in Mr. Rosenkranz's


3

hypothetical, would in effect be arguing that by


4

codifying section 109(a), Congress had implicitly


5

expanded the scope of the implicit -- of the exclusive

6

right to vend or distribute, even though it said it was

7

doing the various opposite.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's an awfully

difficult maze for somebody to -- to get through.

You

10

have to start with the difficulty of the language here,

11

and then you have to proceed and put the Quality King

12

gloss over it; and, when you finally get to that point,

13

you say, well, now you've got to read Bobbs-Merrill and

14

figure out how the common law governs all that.

15

MR. STEWART:

16

under anybody's reading.

17

case determined for whatever reason that section 109(a)

18

was inapplicable, it didn't provide a safe harbor, the

19

next step could never be simply to proceed to judgment

20

and say that there was infringement.

21

would always have to be to look at what the defendant

22

had done --

Official

1

MR. STEWART:

The other point I would make

2

about the Petitioner's approach is that it -- it really

3

has no grounding in the statutory text.

4

Petitioner is arguing that if the publisher in Thailand,

5

if the manufacturer of the books had shipped them

6

directly into this country, that person could have been

7

sued for infringement for the importation and --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
grounding.

That is, the

Well, the word has

It is Coke upon Littleton, 1628, where it

10

says that if a man be possessed of a chattel and give or

11

sell his whole interest upon a condition, that condition

12

is no good.

13
14

And Coke says, and that's how it should be.
And now that's picked up in Bobbs-Merrill;

it's picked up in Dr. Miles.

It's been the law.

Now if, in fact, there are two ways of

15
16

interpreting the statute, and one is consistent with

17

that basic principle of commercial law, and the other

18

produces some of the complexities that you have just

19

mentioned, isn't it better to go with the common law and

20

simply reaffirm a principle that's been in the

21

commercial law almost forever?

22

MR. STEWART:

I -- I give two answers for

23

that.

And the first is that Coke was saying that, in

24

most circumstances at least, a sale is sufficient in

25

order to divest the owner of his prior right to control
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

distribution, but it doesn't say that a sale is

2

necessary.

3

And my point is that when Mr. Rosenkranz

4

says the hypothetical foreign publisher who makes copies

5

with authorization but ships it into the -- them into

6

the United States without could be held liable for

7

infringement, there is nothing in section 109(a) that

8

would allow a court to draw that distinction; that is,

9

although 109(a) is sometimes referred to as a

10

codification of the First Sale Doctrine, it doesn't

11

require an antecedent first sale.

12

So as long as the foreign publisher was the

13

owner of the books at the type -- time they were

14

manufactured, if those books were lawfully made under

15

this title, under Petitioner's reading they could be

16

imported and distributed.

17

We know also that this was not an oversight,

18

that Congress didn't intend the provision to be subject

19

to a sort of implicit first authorized sale requirement,

20

because the language was intended to cover copies that

21

were made pursuant to a compulsory license.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Which of the following is

23

worse:

All of the horribles that the Petitioner

24

outlines to the extent they are realistic, or the

25

frustration of market segmentation, to the extent that
50

Alderson Reporting Company

would occur, if Petitioner's position were accepted?


2

MR. STEWART:

Well, if they actually

happened, then I think the -- the horribles would be


4

worse.

5

offered a reading of all the statutory provisions

6

together that would avoid both.

7

The other couple of things I would say as to
why a first sale by itself -JUSTICE ALITO:

If the -- if that middle

10

ground is -- were found to be not viable, which of the

11

two sets of consequences is worse from the government's

12

perspective, or can you not say?

13

MR. STEWART:

I would say that the

14

consequence that all foreign-made goods, even if

15

imported into the United States with the authorization

16

of the U.S. copyright owner, are subject to continuing

17

licensing requirements, etc., I would say that would be

18

worse than the frustration of market segmentation that

19

would occur under Petitioner's view.

3

it's trying to come up with a middle ground that has

absolutely no basis in the statute.

And then,

If Bobbs-Merrill provides the content for
the First Sale Doctrine, then what does section 109 do?

10

And so the government is creating a scenario in which,

11

in order to save 602 from being superfluous in the way

12

it is described, although we believe it's not

13

superfluous at all, it is making 109 superfluous.
