CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 02-337, Phillip T. Breuer versus Jim's


5

Concrete of Brevard.

Mr. Pinaud.


7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. PINAUD, JR.


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10
11

MR. PINAUD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

This case is about the vitality and scope of the


12

rule of construction from Shamrock Oil that says that the


13

removal jurisdiction to Federal courts should be narrowly


14

construed.


15

As we see it, the overarching question in this

16

case is, as posed by respondent, whether or not the rule


17

from Shamrock Oil applies to cases brought in State court,


18

but based upon a Federal question.

19

three reasons, and I'd like to, if I can, list them, and


20

then I'll go back and -- and cover each of them


21

individually.


22

We think it has to for


First, respondent proposes an unworkable


23

distinction whereby the -- whereby Shamrock Oil is not to


24

be applied where a case is brought under the Fair Labor


25

Standards Act alone, but it should be applied if it's


3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

brought together with some State law claims.

Secondly, Florida has a right to protect its


2
3

citizens.

And thirdly, the Fair Labor Standards Act is


4
5

just -- just as much a part of the law of Florida as any


6

act of the Florida legislature or any decision of the


7

Florida courts.

Let me cover that first point first, which is


8
9

the unworkable distinction.

Respondent concedes that Shamrock Oil would


10
11

certainly apply in a situation where a State law claim was


12

being brought together with a Fair Labor Standards Act


13

claim.

14

We only brought a Fair Labor Standards Act claim.

15

could have, but we didn't.


16

In this case we did not bring a State law claim. 

We


If you were to -- if you were to have that rule,


17

you would have a situation where whether or not Federal


18

jurisdiction was proper would be wholly dependent upon


19

whether a State claim was brought with Federal action.

20

don't think that --


21

QUESTION:

We


But there are unworkable aspects to


22

your position, Mr. Pinaud.

For example, a Title VII case


23

combined with an equal pay case, the equal pay case could


24

not be removed, but the Title VII case could, and then you


25

would split what is essentially one controversy into two


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

parts because one is -- is not removable.


2

MR. PINAUD:

3

QUESTION:

4

Well --


The equal pay would be governed by


the same thing as --


5

MR. PINAUD:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. PINAUD:

There is --


-- the Fair Labor Standards Act.

There is, I think, no question that


8

the Equal Pay Act and the Age Discrimination Act -- Age


9

Discrimination Enforcement Act would be covered by the


10

Court's decision in this case because the enforcement


11

provisions of those statutes are tied to the Fair Labor


12

Standards Act.


13

QUESTION:

And if you're right -- if you're


14

right -- the equal pay case would have to stay in the


15

State court, although the Title VII case could go forward

16

in the Federal court.


17

MR. PINAUD:

18

The -- the second reason that I think Shamrock


That would be correct.


19

Oil applies in this case is because Florida has a right to


20

protect its -- its citizens.

21

Phillip Breuer, Mr. Breuer, who is a resident of the State


22

of Florida who lives in Duval County, who works for Jim's


23

Concrete of Brevard, which is a company in Brevard County,


24

in an employment relationship that took place in Florida,


25

governed by Florida law.

This is a dispute between


They worked in many counties in


5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Florida.

Certainly then Florida has an interest in that


2

relationship and in this dispute.

3

Asahi where you have a -- a California court looking at a


4

dispute between a -- you know, a Taiwanese company and a


5

Japanese company.

This is not a case like


Florida has an interest.


The third point is that the Fair Labor Standards


6
7

Act is just as much a part of the law of Florida as any


8

decision of the Florida legislature or any -- or any


9

opinion of its court.

Under the Supremacy Clause, the


10

laws of the United States are the laws of Florida. 


11

Florida courts have an obligation, an absolute duty, to


12

enforce and uphold the Fair Labor Standards Act just like


13

they have to enforce and uphold the -- the Fourth


14

Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment. 


15

It -- it would be unrealistic to say that Florida has an

16

obligation to uphold these laws, but then has no right or


17

no interest in having them upheld in -- in Florida courts.

So for -- for those reasons, we think that


18
19

Shamrock Oil certainly has to apply to this case.

If you then go ahead and -- and apply the


20
21

Shamrock -- the Shamrock analysis to either the expressly


22

provided language of 1441 or the maintain language of the


23

Fair Labor Standards Act, you have to reach a decision


24

that these cases are -- are not properly to be subject to


25

removal.


6

1

QUESTION:

Well, one can certainly maintain an


2

action in the Florida courts, and unless it's removed, it


3

will continue there.

4

using the word maintain means that the action must


5

necessarily remain there.


I -- I -- it doesn't seem to me that


MR. PINAUD:

6

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, obviously


7

it's our position that maintain in this case does mean


8

that it should remain in State court, and we think it's


9

for a couple of reasons.

The first reason we would say is that once you


10
11

apply the Shamrock analysis, maintain has to mean what we


12

say because in the very worst-case scenario, at least for


13

our position, maintain is ambiguous or -- or capable of


14

two different constructions.

15

the Government argues and respondent argues -- that it's

16

ambiguous.

17

meaning you can maintain to a conclusion in State court,


18

or if it is, rather, capable of meaning that you can only


19

really bring or commence it, then under Shamrock Oil, when


20

we apply that analysis, we should use the conclusion that


21

most limits removal, which would be to -- which would be


22

to say that maintain means you continue on to -- to final


23

judgment.


24
25

Everybody here has argued --


Well, if it's ambiguous, if it's capable of


QUESTION:

Well, except -- except that you have


a later statute that says that it's removable unless --


7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

unless it is expressly provided otherwise.


2

MR. PINAUD:

3

QUESTION:

4

Justice --


And I don't think something that is


ambiguous expressly provides otherwise.

MR. PINAUD:

5

Well, Justice Scalia, I think what


6

you have to do, though, is I think when looking at the


7

expressly -- expressly otherwise provided language, you


8

have to -- first, you have to apply Shamrock Oil to that


9

language.

Now, it's -- it's our position that when


10

Congress used the word expressly provided, otherwise


11

expressly provided, it meant it in a textual sense.


12

That is, the word expressly is capable of two


13

different meanings itself.

14

absolutely unambiguous, or rather, it can mean grounded in


15

some text. 
 Because it's capable of two different

16

meanings, we think that when you apply Shamrock to


17

expressly, you choose the textual meaning because the


18

textual meaning shrinks removal considerably whereas the


19

other meaning expands it.

20

QUESTION:

It can mean super clear or


But I think --


And your reading of the word


21

maintain -- and your whole case hangs on that word,


22

maintain -- suppose the case were brought initially in a


23

Federal court, and there were -- there was a motion, a


24

1404(a) transfer motion, to transfer the case from one


25

district court to another.

I take it on your reading,


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

1404(a) couldn't apply either because you would have to --


2

if the plaintiff chose to maintain it in one Federal


3

court, therefore it couldn't be switched to another?

MR. PINAUD:

4

Justice Ginsburg, I -- I don't


5

think that would be the case.

I -- I don't think that


6

that's really analogous to the situation of bringing it


7

from the State court to the Federal court.

8

it's -- the -- the forum choice I think is significantly


9

different.

It's --


When the employee brings his action in State


10

court, he's choosing that State -- that State forum, and


11

it's for a reason.

12

reasons are -- are actually well articulated in -- in the


13

Government's 1947 brief when they were actually supporting


14

our position.

And -- and we think that -- that those


So I -- I don't think it's --


QUESTION: 
 But if you're relying on the language

15
16

of the statute, maintain in any Federal or State court,


17

any State court, any Federal court.

18

conceding that you could transfer from one Federal court


19

to another, then the plaintiff's choice doesn't inevitably


20

prevail.


21

MR. PINAUD:

So if you are


Well, I think then my -- my answer


22

to that would have to be the rule from Shamrock Oil says


23

if there's two reasonable interpretations, we -- we make a


24

decision that limits removal.

25

reasonable to say that if you bring it in one Federal


I'm not sure it's


9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

court, it can't be transferred to -- to another Federal


2

court on -- on the -- the concerns would -- that would


3

give rise to it.


4

If I could go back, just a moment, to what I was


5

talking about, the -- the expressly provided language,


6

addressing your question, Justice Scalia.

7

that the expressly provided language has to be the textual


8

basis based upon this -- this Court's construction of


9

28 U.S.C. 2283.

We also think


That's the anti-injunction statute.

In


10

that statute, Congress has provided that no -- that no


11

Federal court shall issue an injunction to enjoin a State


12

court proceeding unless expressly authorized by Congress. 


13

We're dealing with expressly provided language in 1441. 


14

We see the language as completely indistinguishable.


15

In Mitchum v. Foster, this Court construed that

16

language in 2283 as saying, look, that language does not


17

mean that you have to have a -- a statute that says you


18

can issue an injunction.

19

we look at the scope -- we look at the purpose and intent


20

of the statute and say is the purpose of -- and intent of


21

the statute to allow an injunction.

22

Court is saying in -- in Mitchum --


23

QUESTION:

Rather, what the Court said was,


So really, what the


That was just a magic language case. 


24

I mean, I think all it was saying is you don't have to use


25

the -- the very words so long as you have clearly made


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that disposition, but I don't know that I would go so far


2

as to say that it -- it stands for the proposition that


3

something has been expressly provided for when there is


4

simply an ambiguous provision that might be interpreted


5

that way, but then, on the other hand, might not be


6

interpreted that way, which is -- which is what I think


7

you have to fairly say about maintain.


8
9

I -- I don't think your maintain argument goes

anywhere unless you apply to it the -- the rule of


10

preference that you're urging upon us, that -- that you


11

have to interpret it so as to prevent removal rather than


12

permit it.

13

the later statute unless you -- unless you interpret that


14

expressly to mean that an ambiguous provision expressly


15

provides, and I just find it hard -- hard to swallow that.

16

And I just don't see any of our cases that -- do you have


17

a case that deals with what was truly an ambiguous


18

provision and -- and nonetheless said that it expressly


19

provided for something?


20

But that -- that preference is eliminated by


MR. PINAUD:

I -- I don't have -- there -- there


21

is no case that I know of that would be on point in -- in


22

this situation, Justice Scalia.

23

we do not -- though we think that the first analysis


24

should start with Shamrock because -- the first analysis


25

of maintain should start with Shamrock because at best


But I would also add that


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

everyone -- everyone agrees that the statute is ambiguous


2

and that is -- that is, that the respondent and the


3

Government would say, well, it could mean this but maybe


4

it doesn't.

5

everything hangs or falls on Shamrock necessarily.


I don't think we say that it's -- that


6

If you look at the way maintain was used in the


7

Fair Labor Standards Act, we think that the word maintain


8

is an express prohibition -- prohibition on its own.

9

is not just our opinion.

This


This was the opinion of the --


10

of the majority of judges, the majority of courts that


11

construed the statute prior to the 1948 amendment.

12

also the opinion of the United States back in 1947.


13

QUESTION:

What's the reason?

It was


I mean, leaving


14

the word out of it, I mean, normally the background rule


15

is -- this is an -- case arising under Federal law, and

16

the background rule through removal is if either party


17

wants to go into Federal court, you can.

18

there's an exception for this statute.

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. PINAUD:

Now, you say


Why?


We believe that the word


maintain --

QUESTION:

I understand the linguistic point. 


I'm saying leave the linguistic point out.
MR. PINAUD:

Why?


Justice Breyer, I'm not exactly


sure why we --

QUESTION:

What -- what reason would there be


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

that people would want to make an exception for this


2

statute, the normal -- I'm not saying there is none.

3

just want to know what the reason is.

4

normal -- I would be just repeating myself.

5

what I'm saying?

MR. PINAUD:

6
7

I


The -- the

Have you got


I -- I think I understand what


you're saying now --


8

QUESTION:

Yes, all right.


9

MR. PINAUD:

-- Your Honor.


10

The -- the reason why Congress wanted an


11

exception in the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow


12

employees to bring these cases in -- in State court --

QUESTION:

MR. PINAUD:

place.

Or Federal, yes.
Well --


Is because? 
 They can bring it either

Right?

MR. PINAUD:

18

in -- in either place.

19

why Congress --


20

Give them a choice.


QUESTION:

Well, they can -- they can bring it

I mean, there would be no reason


The reason why Congress would want


21

employees to have a choice, but would not want the


22

defendant to have the choice or bring it to State court,


23

unlike other Federal statutes is?


24
25

MR. PINAUD:

Because in 1938, when this statute


was passed, it was difficult for many employees around the


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

country to -- to effectively vindicate their rights for


2

unpaid overtime if they had to go to Federal court.

3

is --

QUESTION:

4

This


Mr. Pinaud, that's the same thing


5

with respect to the FELA, and -- and Congress therefore


6

expressly provided that if a railroad worker brings a case


7

in State court, it cannot be removed.

8

responding to the problem of the person who would find it


9

difficult to go to the big city to litigate in the Federal


10

court rather than stay in the State court close to home. 


11

And so doesn't the -- the fact that Congress expressly


12

provided that FELA cases are not removable cut against


13

you?

MR. PINAUD:

14

And Congress was


Justice Ginsburg, I -- there are


15

certainly cases -- certainly statutes where Congress has

16

said this is not removable.

17

is to be held to a standard where they have to use magic


18

language in order to prohibit removal.

19

the -- the real analysis should be what was Congress


20

intending by the statute at issue or else you --

QUESTION:

21
22

what was it -- what?

23

removable?


25

this.

We think that


But -- but before the -- the 19 --


MR. PINAUD:

24

We don't think that Congress


1445 -- before 1948, were FELA cases


I'm not sure.

I -- I will say


Before 1948, you know, Congress had used language


14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

in other statutes that said you can't remove it, and --


2

and we recognize that.

3

to this magic language statute, then -- then nothing they


4

could do or nothing they could intend would matter unless


5

they use this specific language, and we're not sure that


6

that's what the standard should be.

QUESTION:

7

But if you -- if you hold Congress


But we have a string of specific


8

statutes, and then we have 1445 that lists in a row


9

non-removable actions, a catalog of actions that are not


10

removable.

And this one is left out.

11

from that, well, they --


Wouldn't one infer


12

MR. PINAUD:

Well -- I'm sorry.


13

The -- the Reviser's Notes to the -- the 1948


14

revisions are rather meticulous.

They talk about


15

everything they're accomplishing and what they're trying

16

to do.

17

changes that were made to the other sections, like


18

section (c), the other subsections, that in order to


19

accept the proposition proposed by respondent, you would


20

have to conclude that Congress throughout, with these


21

other sections of 1441, certainly intended to contract


22

removal, but yet with 1441(a), it grossly expanded


23

removal.

24

Standards Act cases were generally considered to be not


25

removable.

I -- I think it's noteworthy that with all the


I mean, this is a time now where Fair Labor


That was the prevailing opinion.


15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

There's no mention in the -- in the Reviser's


2

Note or any of the history to the statute that -- that


3

Congress even thought about the Fair Labor Standards Act,


4

so I think the more realistic assumption in the enaction


5

of -- of that legislation was that Congress accepted


6

the -- the prevailing opinion which was that maintain was


7

good enough, that maintain was an express prohibition


8

against removal.


9

The -- when you're looking at the word maintain,


10

also I think it's to see obviously the -- the public


11

policy concerns that I was just addressing with Justice


12

Breyer, but we do think it's important, as did the


13

Government back in 1947, that in enacting this


14

legislation, as it was -- originally appeared back when it


15

was passed, Congress used the word maintain within 38

16

words in the same sentence.

17

be maintained in any court of competent jurisdiction, and


18

then 38 words later, it said it may be maintained by an


19

agent or representative of the employee.

20

to -- if you were to assume that maintained does not mean


21

what this Court essentially has said it meant in the


22

George Moore and Smallwood cases -- and that is that


23

maintain means to -- to continue on -- to continue or


24

uphold, continue on foot a suit already commenced --


25

QUESTION:

Congress said an action may


If you were


When -- when you say that the -- the


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

provision said it could be maintained by an employee, that


2

sounds more like a synonym for brought by the agent of the


3

employee, that the action could be brought an agent of the


4

employee, which of course does not help you.

MR. PINAUD:

5

Well, the way I think we look at


6

it, Mr. Chief Justice, is certainly Congress could not


7

have meant by saying it could be maintained by an agent of


8

an employee that he can file it, bring it, and then


9

somehow have the case ripped from his control.

10

That is


why we think that if you --

QUESTION:

11

Well, but that -- that's the case in


12

any case of a Federal statute covered by the removal


13

statute unless -- unless Congress says otherwise.

14

to say it's ripped from his control by being removed, that


15

happens all the time.


16

MR. PINAUD:

Oh, no.

I mean,


I'm sorry, Mr. Chief


17

Justice.

18

talking about when -- when the Fair Labor Standards Act


19

was originally enacted -- it -- it no longer appears with


20

this language.


21

That -- that's not what I mean.

I don't -- I'm


When it was originally enacted, it said, an


22

action under this section may be maintained in any court


23

of competent jurisdiction, which we all agree is --


24

includes a State court.

25

sentence that that action can be maintained by an agent or


And it also said in the same


17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

representative of the employee so that he didn't have to


2

do it himself.

Somebody else could do it for him.


And the point that we're making is certainly


3
4

when Congress said that that other person can maintain it,


5

they didn't mean that that person could start the case and


6

then have the case ripped from him and have somebody else


7

take it over.

So if you -- if you --


8

QUESTION:

Well, ripped from him in what manner?


9

MR. PINAUD:

Well, that's exactly it, Mr. Chief


10

Justice.

If -- if you were to accept the argument


11

proposed by respondent, you would have to accept that


12

the -- the agent or representative of the employee in 1938


13

could file the case, but then after he filed it, somebody


14

else or someone would have the authority to divest him of


15

his right to prosecute it.


16

QUESTION:

17

MR. PINAUD:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PINAUD:

20

QUESTION:

21

Are -- are you talking about removal?


So you -- you -- when --

I'm --


-- you say ripped from him, you're


not talking about the effect of removal.


22

MR. PINAUD:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. PINAUD:

25

No.


No.


What are you talking about?

I am talking about what could the


word -- I -- I was responding to a -- a question by


18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Ginsburg about the definition and -- and so forth


2

of maintain.

3

has to mean more than simply start or bring or something


4

like that just because, if for no other reason -- if you


5

put aside Shamrock and you put aside the policy arguments,


6

for no other reason that Congress in this statute, in the


7

Fair Labor Standards Act, when it enacted it, used the


8

maintain twice, one to mean you can maintain the suit and


9

one to mean that a person can maintain it for you on your


And the point I was making is that maintain


10

behalf.

11

employee the right to have an agent maintain the suit for


12

him or her, certainly they didn't mean you can just bring


13

it and then somehow, not for removal purposes, but you

MR. PINAUD:

12

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

The

was maintaining his suit could choose to dismiss it.

So I can't see the other wrencher in the picture.

MR. PINAUD:

Well, if the -- the point I -- I am


20

trying to make is that if this representative is


21

maintaining the suit for the employee, if it only means


22

bring, then one could conceivably fashion reasons why that


23

person wouldn't have a -- would not be able to continue on


24

foot that suit aside from the employee.


25

I -- I know we're kind of dealing with -- with


20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the semantics of the word, but I think it's important to


2

show that the word means more than just bring or commence. 


3

At this same time also -- and we've cited the statutes in

our brief -- the -- the Government passed a whole host of


5

laws where they used words like bring and commence.

something more in -- in this case?


Why


Also -- and I know I've mentioned this a couple

9

times -- the word maintain itself -- it was the prevailing


10

opinion back then, before 1948, that maintain was express. 


11

That is the exact language that the Government used in its

brief filed in the Johnson case, that this was an express

prohibition against removal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. HAMENT


10

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


11
12
13

MR. HAMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

Since 1875, a defendant in a civil action has


14

had a right to remove a case arising under Federal law to


15

a U.S. district court. 
 This right is currently codified

16

in 28 U.S.C. 1441(a), which authorizes a civil action --


17

the removal of a civil action of which the Federal


18

district court has original jurisdiction except as


19

otherwise expressly -- otherwise expressly prohibited by


20

an act of Congress.

21

provided language was added in 1948.


22
23
24
25

The except as otherwise expressly


The court below correctly ruled that respondent

had a right to remove this case for three reasons.

First, the plain language of 1441(a) which

allows removal of a case arising under Federal law, such


23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

as a Fair Labor Standards Act case, unless Congress has


2

expressly prohibited removal.

3

text of the Fair Labor Standards Act or its legislative


4

history which even mentions the word removal much less


5

expressly prohibits it.


6

There is nothing in the


Second, Congress has explicitly prohibited


7

removal in a series of enactments, and when it has done


8

so, it has used very explicit language directly referring


9

to removal.


10

Third, the words, may be maintained, in any


11

court -- or any Federal or State court of competent


12

jurisdiction in the Fair Labor Standards Act is identical


13

to language that Congress has used in other statutes,


14

including the Family Medical Leave Act and the Employee


15

Polygraph Protection Act. 
 If this Court were to rule that

16

removal is barred under the Fair Labor Standards Act, then


17

this would affect those statutes.

18

nothing in the text of those statutes which suggests that


19

Congress was attempting to prohibit removal.

20

not mentioned in the text or the legislative history.


21

And again, there is


The word is


When Congress has prohibited removal in a series


22

of statutes, starting in 1910, it has very directly used


23

the word removal, and this has happened both before and


24

after it enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938.


25

In fact, in 1948, Congress created a section of


24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the 28 -- Title 28 under section 1445 and entitled it


2

Non-Removable Actions.

In 1910, Congress stated that certain


3
4

railroad -- cases against railroads under the Federal


5

Employer Liability Act, FELA, that actions arising under


6

those laws may not be removed -- used the words, may not


7

be removed.


8

In 1914, Congress passed an enactment stating


9

that certain actions against common carriers may not be


10

removed.

In 1933, they passed the Securities Act and used


11
12

the words, shall not be removed.

So these laws were in place using very direct


13
14

language when the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in


15

1938.

Since the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted,


16
17

we have examples of four different laws that were passed


18

by Congress, some in 1441(a), some stand alone, that use


19

the words, may not be removed or shall not be removed. 


20

The last one was the actions under the Violence Against


21

Women's Act of 1994.

22

example what Congress had in mind in 1948 when it used the


23

words, except as other expressly provided.

QUESTION:

24
25

didn't.

So we know from example after


But the Wage and Hour Division


In 1947, it expressed the opinion that Fair Labor

2

Standards Act cases were not removable.

MR. HAMENT:

Number one, Justice Ginsburg, at


3

this point the Department of Labor has changed their


4

position, and I think that's because of the addition in


5

1948 of the very express standard that except as otherwise


6

expressly provided by an act of Congress, this type of


7

case would be removable.


8
9

QUESTION:
position is?

Well, what do we care what their


This is not a matter that's within their

12

MR. HAMENT:

13

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.


So, you know, their -- their view on


14

that matter is -- is no more persuasive than -- than


15

yours, if I may say so.

17

QUESTION:

18

And yours might be very persuasive. 


They have the --


19

(Laughter.)


20

QUESTION:

21
22

They have the power to persuade, and


they're knowledgeable.

MR. HAMENT:

Respondent's relying on the view of


23

Congress which set forth a very clear standard in 1441(a)


24

that these types of actions are removable unless expressly


25

prohibited, and we're relying on Congress.

MR. HAMENT:

Is your position they were never


never removable.

QUESTION:

5

And the -- the Department was just


6

wrong on its opinion.


7

MR. HAMENT:

8

QUESTION:

9

Our position is that they were


Correct, Your Honor.


Though what he I guess was driving at


is what the -- in 1938, the year I was born, I'm in San


10

Francisco, but there are a lot of workers down in Salinas


11

putting artichokes in cans.

12

was violating the law, so they go into the State court in


13

Salinas and the employer runs up to San Francisco.

14

once he can remove that case to San Francisco, it's too


15

expensive for the employee to run up there.

16

why your opponent says they -- they wrote this statute. 


17

They used the word maintained, and the administrator who


18

was present at the creation, so to speak, had followed


19

that for quite a long period of time.


And their employer perhaps


And


And that was


Now, you're -- you're saying look at the


20
21

language.

The language just isn't good enough.

22

anything else you want to add on that?


23

MR. HAMENT:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HAMENT:

Is there


Well, Justice Breyer --


You know, on the purposive part.

Yes.

Yes.

Justice Breyer,


27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there -- there is no legislative history to support that


2

Congress was intending to prohibit removal for that or


3

for -- or for any other reason.

4

there are small claims that are possible under the Fair


5

Labor Standards Act, but there are also very large claims,


6

including very large collective actions.

7

wanted to put a limit on the amount of claim that could be


8

brought in a Federal court, then Congress could certainly


9

do that, as it has done in other statutes, and as -- as it


And -- and yes, in --


If Congress


10

has also done in limiting removal of certain cases based


11

on amount.

12

But Congress hasn't chosen to do that.


Turning to the point of the effect of a ruling


13

that these words, may be maintained, could bar removal


14

under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as mentioned and as


15

counsel for the petitioner concedes, this would also

16

prohibit removal under the Family Medical Leave Act, the


17

Employee Polygraph Protection Act --


18

QUESTION:

Well, it might if you -- it might not


19

if you, in fact, did put considerable weight on the


20

knowledgeable views of the -- of the administrators who


21

were present at that time and the presence of a good


22

reason for wanting to have achieved that result.

23

grant you, I see problems with the approach I'm


24

enunciating, but -- but it wouldn't necessarily change


25

those other acts.


28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I -- I


1

MR. HAMENT:

I -- I think the problem would be


2

that the Court would have to -- to eliminate from 1441(a)


3

the expressly provided otherwise language to -- to achieve


4

that result.


5
6
7

QUESTION:

Is it meant to apply retroactively in


1948 to those statutes passed preceding 1948?

MR. HAMENT:

I believe -- I believe it was.

If


8

you look at the timing of the addition of that language in


9

1948, at that time, the right to remove didn't have the


10

expressly provided otherwise exception.

It just was a


11

right to remove, and it was at that time codified in


12

28 U.S.C., section 71, which had the right to remove.


13

But coupled in that same paragraph were two


14

examples of cases where Congress said there was no right


15

to remove, the FELA action and the action under the

16

Interstate Commerce Act dealing with loss of -- or injury


17

under certain actions against common carriers.

18

in the same paragraph was this language, may not remove


19

these two types of cases.


So right


20

When they reorganized, they moved that language


21

to 1440 -- 1441 -- 1445 and I think they were just making


22

clear, when they left the right to remove, that they may


23

from time to time, as they have, expressly prohibit


24

removal of certain actions.

25

addition of that language changed nothing.

So I -- I think the -- the

It is just
