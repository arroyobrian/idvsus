CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will now hear

argument in Case 07-440, Rothgery v. Gillespie County,

5

Texas.

Ms. Spinelli.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MS. SPINELLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Brewer and Jackson, this Court held that

12

an initial appearance before a magistrate like the one

13

here marks the commencement of a criminal prosecution

14

under the Sixth Amendment.

15

that holding makes eminent sense.

16

This case demonstrates why

Rothgery was arrested on the erroneous

17

belief that he was a felon in possession of a firearm.

18

As required by the Texas Code, he was brought before a

19

magistrate, who informed him of the felony accusation

20

against him and required him to post bail or remain in

21

jail to ensure that he answered that accusation.

22

At that point, Rothgery acquired specific

23

rights under Texas law as the accused in a felony case,

24

including the right to have the prosecution against him

25

dismissed if an indictment or information were not filed
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

within a set period and the right to contest the

2

accusation against him prior to indictment in an

3

examining trial before the magistrate.

4

Rothgery was no longer merely a suspect, but an accused

5

within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

At that point,

Counsel, how can

7

this -- how can this be part of an adversary proceeding

8

when there's no other adversary on the field?

9

prosecution's not present.

10

The

They don't even know

anything about this.

11

MS. SPINELLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, this Court

12

held in Jackson that the question whether a particular

13

--

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, in Jackson of

15

course the charges had already been filed by the

16

prosecutor, so there was an adversary on the field.

17

MS. SPINELLI:

What I was going to say was

18

that there is a clear distinction which is set forth in

19

this Court's opinion in Jackson between the question

20

whether a particular proceeding initiates a criminal

21

prosecution and whether that proceeding itself is

22

adversarial in the sense that it requires the presence

23

of defense counsel.

24
25

And, as to the first question, whether a
particular proceeding initiates a criminal prosecution,
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this Court's cases have not held that prosecutorial

2

involvement is a relevant factor, and that --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I suppose -- I

4

suppose you could you have an adversarial proceeding

5

without the prosecutor present, but it would depend on

6

the nature of the proceeding.

7

simply advises the individual of the charges against

8

him, repeats the Miranda warnings, advises him that he

9

can have counsel if bail is denied or if he can't make

10

bail.

What about that is adversarial?

11
12

And here the magistrate

MS. SPINELLI:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, and we don't contend that it is adversarial.

13

In Jackson, this Court made clear that a

14

proceeding need not itself be adversarial in the sense

15

that would require defense counsel to be present to

16

counter the adversary presentation of the prosecutor in

17

order for that proceeding to initiate a criminal

18

prosecution.

19

appearance itself, regardless of those other factors,

20

marked the commencement of a prosecution.

21

Rather, it held that the initial

And it's worth noting that in Jackson

22

substantially the same arguments that Respondent raises

23

here were made by the State there.

24

contended this initial appearance is merely an

25

administrative ministerial proceeding.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

The State there

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess I'll

2

get back to the point I raised earlier, that in Jackson

3

charges had already been filed by a prosecutor.

4

prosecutor was aware of this proceeding.

5

a fairly significant distinction.

The

I think that's

6

MS. SPINELLI:

Well, the Court in Jackson

7

placed no weight on that distinction.

8

something that was mentioned in Jackson.

9

happened in Jackson was that warrants were obtained, the

10

defendants were arrested, and they were brought before a

11

magistrate for this initial proceeding.

12

indication that the prosecutor was present at that

13

initial proceeding.

14

court put no weight on that factor.

15

Court's cases have ever stated that there is a

16

requirement that a prosecutor be involved.

17

makes sense, because the consequences of the initial

18

appearance for the defendant are precisely the same

19

whether or not a prosecutor is involved.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That wasn't
And what

There is no

The Jackson court -- the Jackson
And none of this

And that

But what we're looking for

21

here, at least one of the things we might look for in

22

this case, is a specific rule to give to the States so

23

the State knows when counsel has to be appointed.

24
25

In this case suppose the magistrate, the man
behind the little window, said:

We're going to give you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a ticket; keep in touch with us; don't change your

2

address until you notify us; you're free on your own

3

recognizance.

4

Would counsel have been required there?

MS. SPINELLI:

Had there been no way in

5

which the defendant was bound to reappear and answer the

6

charges, then we would not have the situation that we

7

have, and it would seem less likely that that would

8

initiate a criminal proceeding.

9

have here that make it clear that a prosecution was

The factors that we

10

initiated, just as it was in Jackson on identical facts

--

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Spinelli, there's

13

something confusing about your presentation of this,

14

because you say that at this initial appearance that's

15

called a magistration, you are not contending that there

16

was a right to counsel at that very proceeding.

17
18

MS. SPINELLI:

That's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So when, at what point in

20

time, did this right to counsel attach?

21

attach during that magistration proceeding, when did it

22

attach?

23

MS. SPINELLI:

If it didn't

Well, first I should say I

24

believe that that question goes to Respondent's

25

alternative argument for affirmance.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

The only question

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that was addressed by the Fifth Circuit and the only

2

question presented in the petition was the question

3

whether a criminal prosecution commenced at Rothgery's

4

magistration.

5

Court to direct the entry of judgment in our favor, but

6

merely --

7

And we are certainly not asking this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you are taking the

8

position that there was a right to counsel that attached

9

in this case.

10
11

And I'm asking you at what point in time

that right attached.
MS. SPINELLI:

We believe that -- well, this

12

Court's cases have made clear that the right to counsel

13

attaches at the time a criminal prosecution commences.

14

Now, the question whether counsel must then be appointed

15

immediately upon attachment is a separate question.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MS. SPINELLI:

What does "attachment" mean?
What "attachment" means under

18

this Court's cases is that since a criminal prosecution

19

has now begun, the explicit guarantees of the Sixth

20

Amendment are applicable, the State no longer -- the

21

State cannot interfere after that point with the

22

attorney-client relationship.

23

defendant has the right to counsel to serve as an

24

intermediary --

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

At that point the

Well if Mr. Roth -- if your
8

Alderson Reporting Company

client had shown up at the magistration with an

2

attorney, could the State of Texas have said, no, your

3

attorney may not be present during the magistration?

MS. SPINELLI:
because --

No, I don't believe so,

Upon the magistration.
What does that mean?
So perhaps -- so at the

end -- I suppose I would say at the end, once --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Then why could Texas have

17

said your attorney -- why could Texas have not said,

18

although you came here with an attorney, your attorney

19

may not be present because you don't have a Sixth

20

Amendment right to counsel at the magistration?

21

22

23

MS. SPINELLI:

Your

It won't attach until the

24

attach at the time that the magistrate informed the

25

defendant of the accusation against him, at which point

he became a defendant in a criminal case and his right

2

to counsel attached.

3

Now, to get back to Justice Ginsburg's

4

question, whether -- whether counsel is required to be

5

appointed immediately upon attachment is a separate

6

issue, which is the subject of Respondent's alternative

7

ground for affirmance.

8

to resolve the threshold question, which is the

9

threshold question in every right to counsel case, did a

14

the magistration, but, as you said earlier to Justice

15

Alito, it attaches at the end of the magistration, it

16

seems to me like you're asking for counsel to be an

17

investigator rather than to participate in the trial

18

proceedings.

19

If in fact there's not a right to counsel upon

MS. SPINELLI:

No, I don't believe so, Your

MS. SPINELLI:

It's very different from a

Would your case be different if after the magistration

25

the defendant will answer the accusation -11
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MS. SPINELLI:

Right.
-- then we would be lacking

3

that piece of evidence that he had been accused.

4

still would remain other evidence under Texas law that

5

he was, in fact, an accused at that time.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There

So Texas -- assuming we

7

agree with that, Texas made one of two possible

8

constitutional violations.

9

unconstitutional for Texas to require him to make bail,

10

or it was unconstitutional for Texas not to provide him

11

with an attorney.

12

the latter was the problem rather than the former?

13

Either it was

Why should -- why should we find that

MS. SPINELLI:

Well, there is certainly

14

nothing unconstitutional about requiring bail, as we

15

know.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, there certainly is if

17

you're not charged.

I think it's a very strong point in

18

your favor that he was required to make bail, because I

19

don't think you can hold somebody without charging him,

20

just say, you know --

21

MS. SPINELLI:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23
24
25

Well, we -- I mean, we -The fact -- the fact that

he was held suggests that he was charged with something.
MS. SPINELLI:

We agree, Justice Scalia.

fact, the Texas Code expressly recognizes that the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

function of bail is to ensure that the --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MS. SPINELLI:

4

Sure.
-- accused will answer the

accusation against him.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So maybe, maybe Texas was

6

wrong about that, that it shouldn't have required bail.

7

Maybe that was what was unconstitutional, rather than

8

its failure to provide counsel.

9

MS. SPINELLI:

Well, what occurred here,

10

however, was that Texas did require Mr. Rothgery to post

11

bail.

12

certain specific rights, which only accrued to

13

defendants in criminal prosecutions.

14

And in addition, the magistration gave rise to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- that a magistrate is

15

required whenever bail is set -- pardon me, that an

16

attorney is required whenever bail is set?

17
18

MS. SPINELLI:

We're not contending that an

attorney was required.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The rule is -- I want to

20

know, what do we tell Texas it has to do in all these

21

cases?

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

actually not asking the Court to adopt any new rule

2

today, but simply to reaffirm the rule it has already

3

announced in Brewer and Jackson, which is that an

4

initial appearance before a magistrate, which is a

5

proceeding that is common across jurisdictions and has a

6

common significance across jurisdictions, a proceeding

7

at which a magistrate informs the defendant officially

8

of the accusation against him and of his rights as a

9

criminal defendant --

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

But when do you say counsel

11

has to be appointed?

Is it before the magistration?

12

it at the end, immediately upon the end of it?

13

MS. SPINELLI:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, we believe -What if -- what if an

15

attorney had been appointed here ten days after the

16

magistration?

17

Is

MS. SPINELLI:

Our contention is that an

18

attorney was required to be appointed promptly after

19

Rothgery renewed his request for an attorney following

20

the magistration.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MS. SPINELLI:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, so the -And this Court -What is the -- so the point

of the magistration is that is the point at which a

no counsel there.

11

MS. SPINELLI:

No, not at all.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There's no claim -- for

the attorney would have been required to participate in

3

circumstance, we don't contend that a prosecution would

4

have begun.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in that

Why not, if they

6

initiate charges against them?

You're saying, in

7

Justice Breyer's hypothetical, you're charged with, for

8

example, trespassing or conducting a demonstration on

9

the court grounds, and that's a crime.

You're charged

10

with that, but we are not going to hold you, so, you

11

know, come back in a month.

12

MS. SPINELLI:

Well, it -- it might depend

13

on the manner in which the charges are conveyed or

14

filed.

15

you know, we believe you've committed a crime, certainly

16

that doesn't commence a prosecution.

17

formal -- you know, as happens in misdemeanor

18

prosecutions, if there is a formal complaint filed which

19

can be the basis for a conviction in a misdemeanor case,

20

then it may be that, by analogy to an indictment in a

21

felony case, a prosecution would commence at that point.

22
23

If all that happens is that the police tell you,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what about my

MS. SPINELLI:

I don't believe --

don't know what they say.

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

can advise me about that.

5

MS. SPINELLI:

Other members of the Court

I believe -- I believe a

6

ticket or a citation of that nature would not commence

7

adversary judicial proceedings because it's analogous to

8

a warrantless arrest.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why doesn't it solve your

10

-- the problem that you're obviously wrestling with, if

11

-- if we simply said there is a right to counsel, but it

12

doesn't attach until there's a significant stage of the

13

prosecution which then follows?

14

some proceeding afterwards, yes, then you do need a

15

lawyer, but the mere fact that you've been brought to

16

the courthouse and made bail and let go does not require

17

500 counsel to be provided.

18

some later proceeding, which is an essential part of the

19

prosecution, must you have counsel.
MS. SPINELLI:

That's fine, but -Not merely -But you only need counsel

at significant phases.

MS. SPINELLI:

Oh, right.

And we are not

contending that counsel must be present at that initial

appearance itself.

So just to be clear about

But to address your question, which, again, I

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but it's so wrapped up

14

with how we decide this case.

15

counsel has to be appointed right away for -- for

16

Justice Breyer's 500 demonstrators, I'm going to give a

17

different answer to the first question.

18

that counsel doesn't have to be appointed until the

19

prosecution proceeds to some significant phase where an

20

attorney would be -- would be really helpful, then --

21

then I can -- I can be quite more sympathetic to your --

22

to your argument.

23

MS. SPINELLI:

I mean, if I think that

But if I know

Well, were the Court to reach

24

that alternative argument, which is that -- despite the

25

fact that a criminal prosecution had commenced, and
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Rothgery was an accused, by hypothesis he nevertheless

2

was not entitled to the assistance of counsel for his

3

defense because no critical stage had been reached -- we

4

would say, first of all, assuming that Respondent is

5

correct, that the right to counsel lies dormant

6

following its attachment on the commencement of a

7

criminal prosecution until some subsequent critical

8

stage is reached, if we assume that that is correct,

9

there was such a stage here because Mr. Rothgery was

10

faced with the decision whether or not to invoke his

11

right to an examining trial.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was at the

13

magistration, and you -- you have said that there was no

14

right to counsel at the magistration.

15

MS. SPINELLI:

That's correct, Justice

16

Ginsburg, but his decision regarding the examining trial

17

was not one that needed to be made at the magistration.

18

Rather, this was a right that he possessed to contest

19

the accusation against him under Texas law, which could

20

only be exercised prior to indictment.

MS. SPINELLI:

And, indeed, it

Any time prior -- any

Correct.

And, indeed --

So you're saying that

21

1

that is the critical stage that he needed to have

2

counsel's advice about.

3

MS. SPINELLI:

To the extent that it's

4

necessary to have a critical stage, then we believe that

5

is a critical stage.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that stage would arise

7

immediately as soon as the magistration was completed,

8

9

MS. SPINELLI:

10
11

His right --

He'd have to have counsel

appointed immediately --

ask for this hearing or not.

right?

Yes.

We're contending that

in felony cases -- this is only an issue in felony cases

-- because Texas has provided this right, which is

precisely for defendants in Rothgery's situation, who

10

are innocent but --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then -- but

12

then you are saying that he has a right to counsel at

says:

you can waive your right to that.

MS. SPINELLI:

I think the strongest

precedent for that is Estelle versus Smith, in which

this Court held that counsel -- counsel's assistance is

5

needed not only to conduct and prepare for critical

stages, but also to assist a defendant in deciding

7

whether to undergo them.

8
9

And more broadly, this Court has repeatedly
stated that one of the core purposes of the right to

10

counsel is to ensure that the defendant understands and

11

is able to invoke all of his rights.

12

this was the right that he possessed that could have

13

enabled him to demonstrate his innocence prior to being

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12

MR. COLEMAN:

13

Justice, and may it please the Court:

14

Good morning, Mr. Chief

The magistration that follows every Texas

15

arrest does not begin a criminal prosecution under the

16

Sixth Amendment.

17

formal charges had been filed against him; no one

18

attempted to elicit incriminating information from him;

19

no witnesses were presented --

When Rothgery was magistrated, no

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then how could they hold

them in jail?
MR. COLEMAN:

It is not uncommon -- in fact,

23

it's universal practice that when one is arrested on a

24

25

officer sees an individual in the commission of a crime.

28
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. COLEMAN:

We believe that this is an

2

issue that was addressed by the Court in Gerstein and

3

McLaughlin, that the Fourth Amendment prevents

4

unreasonable seizures and the Sixth Amendment speedy

5

trial rights kick in.

6

type of a seizure that can you have.

7

And so there is a limit on what

And the Fourth Amendment does prevent that,

8

as do other rights, and as the Court recognized in

9

Gouveia.

But the liberty interest that is at stake

there, as the Court said in Gouveia, is not one that

implicates the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

MR. COLEMAN:

could happen; I'm asking whether it would be

constitutional without appointing counsel.

8
9

MR. COLEMAN:

It would be -- not be a

violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it would be a

11

violation of some liberty interest beside the Sixth

12

Amendment.

of the Fourth Amendment or other Sixth Amendment --

It might well be a violation

Alderson Reporting Company

don't --

Without charges filed?

In

3

other words, if the lawyer comes in and says, you know,

4

my client is sitting in jail, you've had him there for

5

three days now, and no complaint has been filed against

6

him, we don't know why he is being held -- your answer

7

-- the -- it's a constitutional answer to say, well, you

8

know, that's for us to know and you to find out?

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. COLEMAN:

11

I think Gerstein would prevent

that, Justice Souter.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, the answer

13

-- your answer is that the Sixth Amendment is concerned

14

with the fair trial, not the detention of individuals,

15

and he has other constitutional rights that would be

16

implicated, but his right to a fair trial is not one of

17

them.

18

MR. COLEMAN:

That's absolutely true here.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the law here in

20

Texas in respect to this particular magistration

21

proceeding?

22

magistrate tells the person arrested, he says precisely:

23

"I find probable cause to believe" that you -- "that

24

there was probable cause to arrest you."

25

they say, right?

I noticed what happened is that the

It said:

That's what

"I have determined that
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

probable cause existed for the arrest of the individual

2

accused therein."

3

All right.

Now, what happens -- and I think

4

it would be helpful to know the answer to this -- in

5

what might be a rare instance, but the truth of the

6

matter is there was probable cause to arrest that

7

individual when he was arrested, but there isn't now.

8

So because he came in -- you know, he said here's 14

9

cousins, I was somewhere else at the time, they all

10

agree.

11

means there isn't now.

12

the magistrate here -- is he required, does he have the

13

power to commit someone, even though he honestly

14

believes there is no longer probable cause, in which

15

case he is making the decision, the magistrate, not the

16

policeman?

17
18

I mean, everybody agrees on a certain fact that

MR. COLEMAN:

And what I'm driving at is does

I don't know the answer to the

constitutional significance of the different --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I could -- I can think

20

there would be tremendous constitutional significance

21

and it would make a difference if all that's really

22

happening is a policeman is arresting someone, in which

23

case we might have liberty interests and others at

24

issue.

25

the magistrate is deciding that there is probable cause

But what's happening in this proceeding is that

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to hold him, in which case it's more like, not

2

completely like, but more like what happens in an

3

indictment or an arraignment, et cetera.

4

MR. COLEMAN:

What is stated on the form --

5

certainly I can't say what was going through the

6

magistrate's mind.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

But I want to know

8

what's Texas law, if you know it, in respect to that

9

question?

10

MR. COLEMAN:

The answer I believe is that

11

you -- that you find that there is probable cause to

12

make the arrest.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

So we have a magistrate who

14

has to find that there is -- no, to make the arrest or

15

to hold him now?

amount of discretion, and I think if a magistrate was

In which case we have before us bringing this

21

Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, couldn't he

23

point out -- I mean, if this is a probable cause

24

determination and he knows a particular fact, couldn't

25

he say, well, Magistrate, you should know this, and the
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

magistrate would say, well, I didn't know that, so

2

there's no probable cause?

3

MR. COLEMAN:

That's possible.

4

And I would like to amend my answer to you,

5

Justice Stevens.

It's not at all uncommon -- once an

6

arrest takes place and an officer can go and present a

7

case to the county or district attorney, it's not

8

uncommon at all for charges then to be filed in the --

9

depending on what the crime, is in the district court or

10

county court, and for the magistration then to be moved

11

over and to take place in an official court.

12

that time, it could very well be.

13

And so at

And we would say -- we would say likely at

14

that point that, yes, that formal criminal judicial

15

proceedings had initiated, and it's not uncommon.

16

in this circumstance --

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But

What about the very

18

proceeding in this case?

Supposing instead of a

19

detective bringing in the affidavit, that the prosecutor

20

did it, had the detective's affidavit, and the

21

prosecutor said:

22

more seriously.

23

have that been sufficient?

This is a case we intend to pursue

It was based on the officer's

Would they have been

Under the Sixth Amendment?

No.
No.
Suppose Texas law provided

that there had to be an examining trial within a certain

10

period of time after the magistration unless there was

11

an intervening indictment.

12

that under those circumstances the defendant would have

13

been entitled to the appointment of counsel shortly

14

after the magistration, at least in order to prepare for

15

the examining trial?

16

MR. COLEMAN:

Then would you not agree

We completely agree that if

17

that were the case, Coleman -- this Court's decisions

18

make absolutely clear he would have been entitled to

19

counsel for an examining trial and would have been -- we

20

would have been obligated and would have appointed

21

counsel at a reasonable time before that examining trial

22

so that the preparations could take place.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would the situation be

24

different simply because Texas law doesn't require the

25

examining trial, but gives the defendant the option of
39
Alderson Reporting Company

demanding one?

2

MR. COLEMAN:

Because there is no prejudice

3

to your fair trial rights from not choosing to have an

4

examining trial.

5

said that there is a Sixth Amendment right to consult

6

with counsel before deciding whether to ask for an

7

examining trial.

somebody asks for one, more often than not the

15

And that's a put up or shut up procedure, but

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we said that when a

16

defendant is ordered held in custody, that there is then

17

a right of counsel, would we be contradicting any of our

18

precedents as opposed, say, to extending them?

19

MR. COLEMAN:

I certainly do believe that

20

the court would.

21

right attaches, that there is an initiation of formal

22

judicial proceedings at the magistration, would

23

contradict not only Kirby, but also Gerstein and

24

Gouveia.

25

I believe that a decision that the

But my

assumption was assuming that the defendant is remanded

2

to custody.

I added that.
MR. COLEMAN:

It's not clear to me that that

makes a constitutional difference in our circumstances.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you were to say

6

that where the State arrests an individual, brings him

7

before a neutral official and intends and does impose a

8

significant restraint on his liberty for the purpose of

9

bringing that individual to trial, there is a

10

presumption that that -- forget the presumption.

11

that happens for the purpose, the primary purpose,

12

primary purpose of bringing the individual to trial, at

13

that point the Sixth Amendment right attaches.

14

If

Now, the State would not have to give him a

15

lawyer if there was some other purpose primary, for

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. COLEMAN:

I -- I think the primary issue

2

with that, Justice Breyer, is that it contradicts what

3

the Court said in Gouveia.

4

lengthy exegesis in Gouveia about what interests in

5

particular are protected and talked about this, this

6

expression of a concern about our liberty interests; and

7

that the purpose issue was not something that the Court

addressed there.

The Court went through a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

I thought you -- I

examining trial to determine whether there really was

25

probable cause, that he would be entitled to counsel at
42
Alderson Reporting Company

that examining trial.

And, yet, that's detached from

2

the fair trial.

3

will never get to trial.

4

MR. COLEMAN:

The whole purpose of it is that they

No.

I -- I disagree with

5

that.

Coleman itself says that the reason we're

6

requiring counsel for a preliminary hearing or an

7

examining trial, as we call it in Texas, is precisely

8

because there will be witnesses, there will be arguments

9

made; and you could waive defenses if not made there;

10

that this is very important.

11

even, this examining trial or preliminary hearing, even

12

though it comes before an indictment, we're going to

13

define that as an event of attachment solely because

14

your right to a fair trial could very much be prejudiced

15

there.

16

So we're going to define

And that -- that doesn't exist in this case,

17

and that certainly the failure to ask for a examining

18

trial does not prejudice your right to a fair trial.

19

Justice Breyer, you asked a hypothetical

20

that I would like -- I would like to address because it

21

is something that happens all the time, and I think

22

should inform the Court's decision here.

23

it is not uncommon, and some statistics that I have seen

24

suggest that it may happen in half of the cases, where

25

an individual is arrested, magistrated, released, and no

incarceration or even attempt to incarcerate, then that

would relate back, and there wouldn't be a Sixth

be the answer to the -- a partial answer?

21

So that even if the right

Isn't that right?

MR. COLEMAN:

Wouldn't that

If -- if the court were to

22

make a rule that depended solely on incarceration, that

23

is true.

24

that argument because he was released on bond.

25

I don't understand Mr. Rothgery to be making

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you couldn't -- you

44
Alderson Reporting Company

couldn't because of the fact that bail -- if you're

2

going to insist on bail, that in effect is

incarceration.

5

States, we're told, that do have counsel attach in

circumstances similar to this.

the problem that I raised if it's really a problem.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is the question of

whether the right attaches, which seems to mean

different things in different situations, a separate

question from what I would think would be the question

17

Why isn't that the question, and

18

"attachment" is simply a label that is used to express

19

one of the conditions for having the right to appoint a

20

counsel?

21

MR. COLEMAN:

I have given this great

22

thought, Justice Alito.

In my mind, the only doctrinal

23

difference it really makes is the situation that this

24

Court has described in Michigan v. Jackson, which I have

25

previously addressed in the Cobb case which I argued.
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But in most other circumstances we think

2

that the analysis is essentially the same, because the

3

Court has never said that there isn't a right -- there

4

is a right to have the assistance of counsel without

5

having a critical stage.

6

In fact, I believe Justice Brennan -- if you

7

will allow me 15 seconds -- Justice Brennan's decision

8

in Maine v. Moulton said:

9

to the assistance of counsel is shaped by the need for

10

the assistance of counsel, we have found that the right

11

attaches at earlier critical stages in the criminal

12

justice process where the results might well settle the

13

accused's fate and reduce the trial, itself, to a mere

14

formality."

15

"Recognizing that the right

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it then episodic?

16

That is, if the right is turned on when there is a

17

critical event, and then the critical event is over, and

18

no more right to counsel until the next critical event?

19

It's not -- you have no right to counsel in between

20

those critical events?

MR. COLEMAN:

Once -- once a case gets

going, I don't believe this Court has ever been

presented with a case where there has been attachment,

24

there have been some critical stages, and then the State

has decided to deny access.

give me some idea, or some empirical assessment, or tell

probable-cause determination and do not have counsel

13

appointed for them and do not have the right to have

14

counsel appointed to them until some other critical

15

phase takes place?

16

MR. COLEMAN:

In Texas, because the Fair

17

Defense Act permits the appointment of counsel for those

18

who are held in custody, all persons who request counsel

19

are appointed counsel within one business day in the

20

large counties and within one -- within three business

days in the smaller counties.

It's correct that Gerstein says that the

The Gerstein determination is something

19

separate from the initial appearance that occurred here.

20

A Gerstein determination is made for the purpose of

21

determining whether there was probable cause for an

22

arrest.

23

equivalent of what happens prior to arrest when a

24

magistrate decides whether there is probable cause to

25

issue a warrant.

It can be made ex parte.

It's essentially the

55

What happened here, by contrast, was after

2

arrest and after the police had decided to --

3

Mr. Rothgery, he was brought before a magistrate.

4

was officially informed of the accusation against him,

5

and at that time he acquired the right to contest the

6

accusation against him in an examining trial, which we

7

believe shows that he was accused within the meaning of

8

the Sixth Amendment, and a prosecution had begun.

9

He

And we are not contending that that initial

10

proceeding was, itself, a critical stage where counsel

11

was required; and it's not necessary to contend that in

12

order to prevail on the point that that was when a

13

prosecution commenced, which is the only question that

14

we believe is properly before this Court and the only

15

one we are asking it to resolve.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So Texas would be

17

better off if they didn't have a magistration proceeding

18

at all, if they didn't have a proceeding to alert the

19

individual of the charges against him; they did not have

20

a proceeding to read him his rights; they did not have a

21

determination of probable cause.

22

off if they didn't do any of that?

23

MS. SPINELLI:

They would be better

Well, I mean I think you are

24

suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, that reaffirming the rule

25

adopted in Jackson would create, you know, a perverse
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

incentive for States to do away with this proceeding.

2

don't believe that that's the case because, as Justice

3

Breyer observed, 45 jurisdictions already follow the

4

rule of appointing counsel at, or immediately following,

5

the initial appearance, which the -- any CDL brief lays

6

out and which neither Respondent nor its State amici

7

have contested.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

for the State to provide this additional layer?

Well, what's in it

10

Because, of course, the person gets Miranda warnings

11

when he is arrested.

12

do this?

13

I

And so why -- why should the State

MS. SPINELLI:

The initial appearance serves

14

a specific, substantive purpose which I think is well

15

described in the Seventh Circuit's decision in Armstrong

16

cited on page 15 of our reply brief, which is this is

17

the proceeding at which the defendant is informed:

18

are now a criminal defendant.

19

against you, and these are your rights as a defendant in

20

a criminal proceeding.

21

You

This is the accusation

And for that reason, as the Armstrong

22

decision says, it is commonly recognized across

23

jurisdictions as the inception of a formal prosecution,

24

and we believe that's the rule that this Court has

25

already laid out in Brewer and Jackson and should
57

reaffirm today.

2
3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
an extra minute?

4

Why don't you take

We have eaten up your rebuttal time.

MS. SPINELLI:

Of course, absolutely.

I

5

mean, just to respond to one other question that arose

6

during the course of Respondent's argument, I think it

7

is important to understand that in Texas, as in other

8

jurisdictions, there are two phases in a felony

9

prosecution.

10

There is an initial phase that commences in

11

a magistrate court where a document setting out the

12

charges will be filed either by the police or by a

13

prosecutor, and the magistrate at that point has

14

jurisdiction over that criminal case.

15

that an indictment or information will be filed in the

16

general trial court with jurisdiction to enter final

17

judgment.

18

It is only later

But this Court has repeatedly rejected the

19

notion that a prosecution begins only in that second

20

phase.

21

it in Coleman, in Brewer, in Jackson, and in statements

22

in Kirby and McNeil.

It rejected it expressly in Moore.

It rejected

So that can't be the rule.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MS. SPINELLI:
