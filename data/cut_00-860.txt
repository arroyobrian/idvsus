We'll hear argument

John Malesko.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:

The issue in this case is whether an action for


12

damages under Bivens should be applied to a private


13

corporation acting under color of Federal law. 


14

Like many cases, where you come out on a case


15

like this, I think in many ways depends on where you


16

begin, and the parties have put forward to this Court


17

fundamentally conflicting paradigms with respect to the


18

best way to analyze Bivens based on this Court's prior


19

decisions. 


20

The respondent and the court below essentially


21

concluded that Bivens is a ubiquitous remedy that ought,


22

generally, to be available in order to maximize recoveries


23

and to maximize, or at least optimize, deterrent values,


24

and that it is our burden essentially to try to ascertain


25

whether there might be some conflicting or some exception

to the Bivens doctrine that would get us out from under


2

liability in the -- in this particular case.

3

QUESTION:

The --


Mr. Phillips, do you -- this -- this


4

involves only an action against the corporation not


5

against its employees.


6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.


Would -- if the action were brought


8

as a Bivens action against the employees, do you concede


9

that there would be a Bivens action against them? 


10

MR. PHILLIPS:

We have always assumed, from the


11

first day of this litigation, that a Bivens action would


12

lie against the individual employees.


13
14
15

QUESTION:

Well, there's a difference between


assuming it arguendo and conceding it. 

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, for purposes of this


16

litigation and for purposes of my client, there's no


17

question we would concede that an action would have


18

legitimately been -- been raised against them.

19

a future case whether or not a private employee might


20

raise an argument as to whether Bivens should be extended


21

is a separate question. 


22

QUESTION:

To say in


Now, if that's -- if that's true and


23

that concession holds, if the employee is sued for a


24

wrongful act, under State law would it be permissible in


25

your view, just under standard principles of derivative

liability, to hold the corporation for that tort, for the


2

tort of its own employee?


3
4

MR. PHILLIPS:

You mean under a theory of


respondeat superior. 


5

QUESTION:

Yes. 


6

MR. PHILLIPS:

As a matter of State law, it's


7

going to depend on the State.

8

recognize respondeat superior liability. 


9

QUESTION:

Most States I think do


So, State courts -- State courts


10

could do that without interference with any Federal policy


11

or -- or without any superseding Federal law to the


12

contrary. 


13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, obviously, there's going to


14

be at least the potential argument raised with respect to


15

Boyle and whether or not the -- the decision to hold the


16

individual liable under those circumstances is preempted


17

under Boyle.

18

weaker than it was in Boyle, and it probably depends to a


19

certain extent on -- on the -- on whether or not the


20

Federal Government in fact is dictating what both the --


21

what the employer and the employee are doing with respect


22

to --


23

But I think the argument here is slightly


QUESTION:

Well, if that's true, the employer, I


24

assume, would routinely be named in the suit.

25

not doing a whole lot by saying that the employer is

So, you're

independently liable for its own -- for its own


2

participation in the -- or alleged participation in the


3

tort.


4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think you're doing an


5

extraordinary amount, Justice Kennedy.

And the


6

Government's brief, I think quite rightly, points out at


7

page 20 in footnote 10, that the availability of a


8

corporate defendant significantly changes the mix with


9

respect to any kind of litigation.

And actually, if you


10

look at the three cases that postdate this Court's


11

decision in FDIC v. Meyer, all of those are cases in which


12

the only defendant who was named happened to be the


13

corporation.

14

those circumstances. 


15

The individuals were not named under any of


QUESTION:

But Mr. -- Mr. Phillips, if the -- if


16

the proper way of looking at this is the principal agency


17

relationship, when you're dealing with the Federal


18

Government, the Federal Government is the principal, the


19

agent is the officer.

20

contracts, the principal agency relationship exists with


21

the corporation.

22

that the agent -- the agent in this case is the


23

corporation -- why the agency liability doesn't carry


24

over.


25

Here, when the Government

1

question, Justice Ginsburg, I think is where the -- where


2

the mistake lies in the final outcome of the decision. 


3

This Court made quite clear in FDIC v. Meyer that it's not


4

a principal agency relationship because there's no


5

question that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation


6

was the agent of the United States Government for purposes


7

of what it did in that particular context.

8

that's not the right analysis. 


9

The Court said


The right analysis is to go back and look at the


10

Bivens action and make a judgment with respect to whether


11

or not the litigation, as it comes to this Court,


12

adequately serves the two primary purposes of Bivens; that


13

is, that there is relief available and that there is an


14

effective deterrent in place. 


15

If those -- if those are satisfied, then the


16

issue of whether you should extend Bivens to a new


17

category of defendants, this Court said, should be


18

answered in the negative, saying that there is no reason


19

to add additional defendants under those circumstances. 


20

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, I wish somebody here


21

were arguing on behalf of the employee.

It's -- it's


22

certainly in your interest to say, well, of course,


23

there's liability on the part of the employee.

24

-- it's in the interest of -- of your opponent to -- to


25

say the same.

And it's


I'm not -- I can see us deciding this case

1

on, you know, well, after all, there's a suit against the

employee.

which somebody is -- is arguing that the employee is not

Shouldn't we face that in a -- in a case in

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

QUESTION:

No, Justice --


And there are arguments to that


7

effect.

I mean, after all, the -- the employee you say is


8

an agent of the United States, but if -- if he's acting


9

under color of Federal law as an agent of the United


10

States, he's only an agent of the United States because


11

he's -- he's an agent of -- of your client.

of an agent of an agent.

to hold -- to hold the employee and not to hold your


14

corporation.


15

MR. PHILLIPS:

So, he's sort


It would seem very strange to me


Well, the question ultimately


16

comes down to this, Your Honor, is that does it make any


17

more sense in this context to resolve this issue at this

point in time than it did to decide the FDIC v. Meyer case

24

resolve the conflict as to whether a private corporate

defendant ought to be liable under these circumstances. 


Because, again, we didn't have the

And what the


1

So, that issue needs to be resolved. 


2

And, what's more, if the Court puts off for


3

another day deciding the liability of the employee, it


4

doesn't affect whether my client ought to be held not


5

responsible in a Bivens action because either one of two


6

things will happen.

7

employees are, in fact, susceptible to an action under


8

Bivens, in which case the adequacy of the remedy and the


9

adequacy of the deterrent by having that direct lawsuit


Either you will conclude that private


10

means that there's no reason to extend Bivens to my


11

client.

12

between public and private actors and that we have special


13

reasons giving us hesitation and caution into extending


14

the Bivens action, since it's an implied cause of action


15

and not a congressionally adopted one, into the sphere


16

where the private actors are acting under color of Federal


17

right.


18

Or you'll conclude that the distinction is

Strictly speaking, Mr. Phillips, for

you to say that you're making a concession that the

MR. PHILLIPS:

They phrased it


I know they did. 

I'm not giving up much in that


regard. 

But as I say, the important element here, at


7

least in my judgment, about how all this plays out is that


8

if the Court decides that employees are amenable to suit,


9

there's no reason to sue the corporation.

If they decide


10

they are not amenable to suit, it's going to be because of


11

the public/private distinction.

12

theory, we're not amenable to suit.


And again, under that

MR. PHILLIPS:

That would be an argument, but in

order to do that, Justice Scalia, you would then have to

abandon what was one of the principal legs of Bivens in


24

the first instance, which is that the litigation against

the private individual and the deterrent value of

1

litigation against the private individual is the most


2

significant way to achieve the overall objectives --


3

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know that we would have


4

to abandon that because the -- the concern, as I


5

understand it, that the action against the individual has


6

a more significant deterrent effect than the action


7

against the agency, was a concern that was expressed in


8

the context of dealing with a public agency. 


9

Here we're dealing, in the case of your client,


10

with a private corporation.

11

deterrent effect of holding the private corporation liable


12

for the acts of its employee would be very significant.

13

assume that a private corporation like yours is going to


14

be very careful about employees who, in effect, saddle it


15

with significant liability.

16

it seems to me you -- you would lose the argument. 


17

MR. PHILLIPS:

And I would suppose that the


I


So, on the deterrence theory,


I think the flaw in your analysis


18

of the deterrence theory, Justice Souter, is that you're


19

looking to figure out what is sort of the optimal answer


20

for deterrence.

21

in FDIC v. Meyer is that what we satisfy ourselves about


22

is, is there an effective deterrent and an effective


23

damages remedy in place and available to the individual


24

plaintiff in a particular instance.

25

to me that's the gap-filler role that Bivens calls on the

Then you have to take into account the

10

that's a series of questions, I submit to Your Honors, you

ought to leave to Congress. 


12

And that's exactly what the Court said in Meyer.

questions of effect on the Federal treasury, those are

issues that we think are better dealt with by Congress as

QUESTION:

Yes, but if you carry -- if the carry

the logic of that argument far enough, then there would be

no liability at all because we know that if we hold, for

example, the individual liable, there is going to be a


21

tendency there to shift that liability either by insurance


22

or by respondeat superior and insurance, ultimately to the

cost of contracting.

At least, we make that


But the -- I think the answer to that is there

are two components of Bivens.

the gap-filler adequate remedy?

and a deterrent effect from that damages remedy?

14

there will be a serious question as to whether or not,

nevertheless, special circumstances suggest that there

ought to be caution.

respondents burden to satisfy both elements of that. 


18

One is, is there in place

Is there a damages remedy

Is that


Then sometimes, even though that's in place,

What I'm suggesting to you in this context is


19

you don't have to look at what the impact would be on the


20

to look at is whether there is an adequate remedy in

We could differ and disagree about what's the

think you can read Richardson as saying categorically that

Bivens and clearly abandon what you said in Meyer.


8

To


With respect to the ability of the private

person to come in and argue the next time around, his

argument I think, frankly, is going to be a tough one


11

because what he's got to say is even though you have now


12

held the corporation not to be liable -- I'm assuming for


13

purposes of the moment that I win here -- that -- that we,


14

nevertheless, also ought not to be liable.

I said earlier, I think the distinction there is between

18

for the private employee under those circumstances to make

MR. LAMKEN:

There is no

should be assumed arguendo because if there's a reason not


21

to subject the individuals, the private individuals, to

liability under Bivens, it would be that private

individuals have so few immunities and so few defenses,

compared to their governmental counterparts, that there's

15

look at, for example, the fifth edition of Prosser &


16

Keeton on Torts, William Prosser tells us that that


17

argument is makeweight, and that the real reason for

holding the corporation liable under respondeat superior


19

is to ensure that the costs of accidents are incorporated


20

into the price of products and, therefore, spread to


21

society at large. 


22

In a context like this one, where you have one


23

purchaser, the Government, and the cause of action is


24

unique to where the Government is the purchaser of the


25

service, that type of rationale can't hold water.

complaining about the policy then. 


14

MR. PASTERNAK:

Well, there's still a complaint

that would exist -- I mean, there is a possible claim as

far as the ADA and just the general logic of housing

somebody with a known heart condition on the fifth floor

where he would be susceptible to being ill in the event of

a fire.

acknowledged in discovery, in order to have someone housed

on that higher floor if there's a danger that exists.

where does a private for-profit corporation fall on the

to the public, or is it more akin to a regular Federal

would -- my client, in filing the suit pro se, satisfied. 


8

He would also be satisfying a lower standard as far as the


9

negligence as well. 


10

QUESTION:

Was this complaint ever amended since


11

your client gained representation, or are we still


12

operating under the pro se complaint?


13

MR. PASTERNAK:

It was amended only for the


14

purposes of -- of attempting to name Mr. Urena as a


15

defendant, and then there was a proposed second amended


16

complaint which would be naming additional defendants,


17

which -- and I believe also different causes of actions,


18

but that was denied at that time.

At -- at -- it's puzzling why there

5

to identify who the John Doe was and would have had to


6

know how to conduct the discovery in order to ascertain


7

who the John Does were and the difficulty that he would


8

have, as far as the corporation's responsiveness to


9

identifying who Mr. Urena was, who set the policy as far


So, he had the case


10

as the elevator, who set the policy as far as the


11

medication, who set all of the policies. 


12

It


It's not an easy burden for someone to try and


13

identify who the specific person is that would have to be


14

sued, which is why the suing of the corporation is a more


15

manageable one from the plaintiff's point of view. 


16

It would also be a more manageable one from the


17

defendant's point of view, we would submit, also because


18

it would allow the corporation to be the one who's


19

controlling the litigation. 


20

It would be avoiding potential conflicts that


21

exist by naming the individual employees and having them


22

go out and retain their own counsel.

23

-- it would reduce the cost of the litigation for the


24

defendant because you're ultimately looking at the


25

1

attorneys as opposed to a multiple set of attorneys.

2

the cost to defend would go down as far as the


3

corporation. 


4

So,


If we're also operating under a claim under


5

Federal law, then the rules of the game, as far as the


6

discovery, as far as the motion practice and general


7

procedure, would also be under the Federal law as opposed


8

to the State law, so that it would be easier for the


9

corporations to control their costs because they would


10
11

know how to be defending this type of an action. 

And in fact, hopefully, these types of actions


12

would be decreasing as the liability would be there. 


13

There are certain programs that would be going into place


14

by the companies to make certain that everybody has the


15

proper training in order to avoid these types of


16

constitutional violations. 


17

Indeed, that's one of the reasons that we submit


18

that there would really be no danger to the public fisc. 


19

In the normal situation, you have a suit against a


20

Government employee where the Government afterwards comes


21

in and it either has provided counsel and will also pay


22

any judgment that exists.

So too, you have a situation where CSC has

acknowledged that it normally does indemnify its

which required CSC to indemnify the Bureau of Prisons. 


And in our situation, there's a contract that

In addition, it required CSC to have insurance. 


9

So, before any danger could take place to the public fisc,


10

the first thing that would happen, as far as a judgment


11

which would be rendered, is that it would be coming from


12

the insurance company. 


13

The insurance company would then have to make a


14

determination, is this something that would justify an


15

increase in premiums or can it be more properly addressed


16

solely by the implementation of special programs and


17

trainings and seminars to the individual employees? 


18

If it were to increase its premiums, then the


19

corporation would have to make a determination whether or


20

not to pay it or to seek other insurance to get a better

rate.
