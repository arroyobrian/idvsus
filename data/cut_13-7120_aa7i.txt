 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear

5

States.

 Ms. Menendez. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZ 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Mere possession of a shortbarreled shotgun 

12

is not a violent felony within the definition of the 

13

Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause because it 

14

is neither similar in the degree of risk nor similar in 

15

kind to the enumerated offenses set forth in the 

16

language that immediately precedes that clause.  And 

17

this Court has repeatedly held that those enumerated 

18

offenses provide important both qualitative and 

19

quantitative parameters to lower courts in examining 

20

whether a particular predicate offense counts as a 

21

violent felony. 

22

 Just 6 years ago in Begay, this Court made 

23

clear that the enumerated offenses must be similar 

24

I'm sorry, a question predicate offense must be similar 

25

in kind to one of the enumerated offenses as well as

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

similar in degree of risk.  And when that proper 

2

framework is applied to the question of mere possession 

3

of a shortbarreled shotgun, it satisfies neither test. 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Should the Court 

5

should the Court take into account that in the 

6

sentencing guidelines a possession of a shortbarreled 

7

shotgun is ranked under career, is under the career 

8

offenses? 

9

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, in Guideline 

10

Amendment 674 in 2004, which Your Honor asks about, the 

11

Sentencing Commission included mere possession of an 

12

unregistered shortbarreled shotgun or possession of a 

13

shortbarreled shotgun as a crime of violence.  But it 

14

did not do so after an examination of the empirical data 

15

or an assessment of the pool of data that gives us great 

16

confidence in the Sentencing Commission's decisions. 

17

 In marked contrast, Your Honor, in 1991, 

18

when the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 433 

19

that concluded that being a felon in possession of a 

20

firearm should not count as a crime of violence under 

21

the guidelines, it reached that conclusion after an 

22

extensive examination of empirical data.  The difference 

23

between the adoption of those two amendments highlights 

24

the reason that the Sentencing Commission's decision on 

25

this point does not deserve deference in this case.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 An additional consideration, Your Honor, is 

2

that in making that decision in 2004, the Sentencing 

3

Commission was not anticipating the guidance that this 

4

Court provided in James, Begay, Chambers, and Sykes, and 

5

it doesn't engage in any of the proper analysis.  So 

6

whether we look at it as the Sentencing Commission not 

7

serving their traditional role as factfinders and the 

8

keepers of empirical data or whether we acknowledge the 

9

fact that it preceded very important guidance from this 

10

Court, I don't think it controls this Court's decision. 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

15
16

Is it 
Is it possible 
I'm sorry. 
Is it possible for any 

possession offense to qualify as a violent felony? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, I believe it 

17

would be possible for a very rare possession offense to 

18

qualify as a violent felony if the possession alone 

19

presents a serious potential risk of injury. 

20

Respectfully, I believe the flaw with the other side's 

21

position in this case is their entire analysis is based 

22

not on the risk inherent in the mere possession, but on 

23

the risk inherent in committing a further violent crime 

24

with that weapon.  And so I believe that any mere 

25

possession of a firearm, including a shortbarreled

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

firearm, is not going to satisfy the definition. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But if I understand the 

3

government's argument, it's that there's a very strong 

4

correlation between possession in this case and use for 

5

criminal purposes of a kind that clearly would pose a 

6

risk of  of violent conduct and injury.  So are you 

7

saying that we never can take that kind of correlation 

8

into account, that possession crimes just have to be 

9

treated in a box, and we can't think about whether the 

10

possession of something increases the risk of use which 

11

then will pose a serious risk of injury? 

12

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your  Your Honor, my 

13

response is twofold.  First, although the government has 

14

asserted that correlation, they have not substantiated 

15

it in any way.  And there's no data before the Court 

16

that supports the claim that merely possessing a 

17

shortbarreled shotgun is somehow connected with 

18

frequent or even regular use. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So  so that seems right, 

20

that it's a question to pose to the government.  It's 

21

like, what's in back of this correlation?  But is your 

22

argument, then, they haven't made their empirical case 

23

or even if they had lots of statistics, it still 

24

wouldn't be enough? 

25

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

And that is correct, Your

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Honor.  I think even if they had made the empirical 

2

case, it wouldn't be enough.  And here's why. 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

is there any other 

use for a shortbarreled shotgun? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, as many as 40,000 

6

Americans have purchased these weapons legally, 

7

registered them lawfully and have found that they serve 

8

some purpose.  Whether that purpose is in hunting for a 

9

person of a smaller stature or home defense, the 

10

question before the Court is not whether there is some 

11

reason to have them.  Many people believe there is.  The 

12

question is whether merely possessing such a weapon is a 

13

violent felony.  And with due respect, Your Honor, I 

14

don't think there's any support for the assertion that 

15

these are somehow uniquely more dangerous. 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

People have purchased this 

even though it's criminal to possess it? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

It is not, Your Honor.  In 

19

fact, it's fully lawful to possess a shortbarreled 

20

shotgun in many States as long as it's registered 

21

federally, somebody passes a background check, and pays 

22

a $200 tax.  And the government's own statistics 

23

document, Your Honor, that as many as tens of thousands 

24

of Americans have followed those processes in order to 

25

legally purchase or own one of these weapons.  And, in

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fact, I was surprised in doing the research for this 

2

case that you can get these on line in States where 

3

their possession is legal as long as you comply with the 

4

Federal regulations. 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How many States is it 

illegal, do you remember? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, I believe there's 

8

10 States that outright ban possession regardless of 

9

compliance with Federal regulations.  And then in the 

10

remainder of the States, the question is whether, if its 

11

possession is legal in compliance with either State 

12

registrations or always in compliance with the Federal 

13

registrations. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Just a factual question. 

15

On his plea for this possession, was he charged with 

16

another crime? 

17

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Yes, he was, Your Honor.  He 

18

was charged with a  a marijuanarelated crime.  And 

19

both of those were pleaded guilty to with Alford pleas, 

20

Your Honor. 

21

 Your Honor, I think the question is how much 

22

speculation is permitted.  And as Your Honor correctly 

23

points out, it is our position that even if the 

24

government brought forth better data, that still 

25

wouldn't justify allowing mere possession to count as a

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

crime of violence.  The reason, I think, is inherent in 

2

this Court's jurisprudence from James, Begay, and the 

3

other cases.  We have to begin this with a consideration 

4

of the elements.  In fact, in the James case 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But you said that a 

6

possession offense could qualify.  So if someone 

7

possesses a nuclear bomb, that could qualify? 

8
9
10
11
12

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, I think that 

might be 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

A biological or chemical 

weapon, that could qualify? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

And I think that is the 

13

precise thing that could qualify.  And here is why, with 

14

due respect, Your Honor.  Possessing a biological or a 

15

chemical agent, by itself, presents a substantial risk, 

16

just alone, even if it's under your bed. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, how do we know that? 

18

You  you could make the same argument that you've just 

19

made, that we don't know what the  the risk is that 

20

this will, in the case of a biological weapon, the risk 

21

that it will cause an infection unintentionally.  We 

22

don't know that.  That statistic is no more available 

23

than the statistic on sawedoff shotguns, is it? 

24
25

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, I suspect that we 

would be better able to document the certainty that even

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

doing nothing more than possessing such an item 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

How would you do that? 

3

You'd look at all the  you try to  to identify the 

4

universe of people who have possessed biological weapons 

5

and see how many times somebody has gotten infected 

6

unintentionally? 

7

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, that  that 

8

might be appropriate, or perhaps the science alone.  But 

9

that demonstrates the difference with this.  This is no 

10

more dangerous than any other firearm if it's kept in a 

11

locked gun safe, kept in a closet, kept under a 

12

mattress, under a bed or any of the other myriad places. 

13

We've highlighted for the Court 14 different cases on 

14

page 14 of our reply brief where such a weapon was found 

15

in completely nonviolent circumstances, somewhere in a 

16

home or even in a trunk, in a locked gun safe. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

18

thing about any weapon. 

19

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

20

Any firearm for certain, Your 

Honor. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

22

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

24

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

25

So you would say the same 

Any firearm?  Mortars? 
I'm sorry? 
Mortars?  Artillery pieces? 
Your Honor, I think mere 

possession does not pose the kind of substantial risk

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that this statute is talking about.  I think that when 

2

we get into the very, I'm sure, hypothetical instance of 

3

the bomb that's inherently dangerous, like a biological 

4

agent, that might be different even untouched, Your 

5

Honor. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Rockets would not be 

7

illegal possession of a rocket, that wouldn't be a 

8

violent felony in your submission.  Maybe that's right. 

9
10

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

I believe that's correct, 

Your Honor. 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

12

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

That's correct. 
I believe that using a rocket 

13

in a crime of violence or in any other circumstance 

14

would be.  And, in fact, Your Honor, I think that in 

15

many of these cases, for instance possession of a 

16

biological agent or a nuclear weapon, the person would 

17

likely be charged with some sort of terrorism offense, 

18

which would, by itself, trigger the Armed Career 

19

Criminal Act if they were free to go on and commit 

20

future crimes, which I  I somewhat doubt. 

21

 In this case, though, I think there's 

22

nothing different about mere possession of a 

23

shortbarreled shotgun as compared to other firearms 

24

that could be simply possessed.  They are simply not 

25

enough.

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Your Honors, this Court's jurisprudence 

2

clearly requires a categorical assessment of the 

3

question, not an imagining of what further crimes could 

4

ever happen as a result of the offense, but a looking at 

5

what comes from the elements itself.  I'd encourage the 

6

Court to remember its decision in James.  In James, the 

7

Court first examined the elements of the burglary, the 

8

attempted burglary statute in question, and noted that 

9

mere possession of burglary tools was not enough to 

10

constitute a violation of that attempted burglary 

11

statute.  And in part, because an overt act toward 

12

entry, which presented the same sort of risk as the 

13

burglary itself was present, the Court found that that 

14

could present a risk sufficient to trigger the residual 

15

clause. 

16

 This is very different. 

This is much more 

17

like mere possession of the burglary tools, which would 

18

not be enough, than it is completing an additional overt 

19

act. 

20

 Your Honor, the government uses the Court's 

21

language of ordinary case to invite this Court to engage 

22

in substantial speculation about someone  what someone 

23

might do with a shortbarreled shotgun.  And with due 

24

respect, I don't believe that was the purpose of the 

25

ordinary case doctrine whatsoever.  In fact, in James,

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the ordinary case doctrine was borne not to enable 

2

rampant and creative speculation, but to limit rampant 

3

and creative speculation. 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But what you have  what 

5

were the numbers, if they're there, about how many 

6

people are injured as a result of possession of a 

7

shortbarreled shotgun? 

8

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10
11

There are no statistics. 
So we have absolutely no 

idea? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

We have  we have no 

12

statistics that demonstrate, Your Honor, a correlation 

13

between mere possession of a shortbarreled shotgun 

14

and 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's not what I'm 

16

thinking of.  I'm thinking of do we have a statistic 

17

that says how many people are injured, forgetting how 

18

whether it's possession or not possession or anything 

19

else? 

20

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

We don't have that, either, 

21

Your Honor.  We do have statistics offered both in our 

22

brief and some reference in opposing counsel's brief 

23

about how shortbarreled shotguns are at most a de 

24

minimis, de minimis percentage of harm from weapons in 

25

general across the country, but that doesn't answer Your

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Honor's question.  And Your Honor, I think that that is 

2

precisely why the Begay formulation remains very 

3

important in this case. 

4

 This case, unlike Sykes, which had an ample 

5

amount of data, although I think we could discuss at 

6

length how useful that data is and how much data can be 

7

manipulated, but there was a great deal of data 

8

documenting deaths and injuries.  And therefore, this 

9

Court found that the examination of the nature of the 

10

offense and whether it was purposeful, violent or 

11

aggressive was redundant.  That's not the case here, 

12

Your Honor, because we don't have the statistical 

13

analysis to make the risk assessment easy. 

14

 I do think, though, that common sense weighs 

15

heavily in favor of Mr. Johnson.  And that is, as Your 

16

Honor indicated in the Doe opinion many years ago on the 

17

First Circuit, that merely possessing something is a 

18

very far cry from using it in a crime.  And the 

19

government's entire analysis requires this Court to 

20

assume that these weapons are most commonly possessed 

21

only for the purpose of being used in a crime.  That's 

22

simply not supported by the data, and it's not even 

23

supported by the case law provided by the government. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  Do we know 

how many possession crimes have been prosecuted,

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

possession for shortbarreled shotguns? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

I don't have that statistic, 

3

I apologize, Your Honor.  I can say that, having been an 

4

assistant Federal defender for quite a long time, we 

5

don't see these very commonly, but we do see people 

6

prosecuted for possessing a shortbarreled shotgun 

7

that's not federally registered.  It's not an incredibly 

8

frequent crime. 

9

 However, this has greater implications, 

10

obviously, Your Honor, because approximately 600 people 

11

every year suffer the greater penalties of the Armed 

12

Career Criminal Act as a result of enhancements such as 

13

this. 

14
15
16
17
18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's what I mean. 

It's about 600 a year? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

600 ACCA cases each year, 

more or less, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

More or less.  So we're 

19

talking about 35,000 people or 40,000 who own the 

20

shotguns legally. 

21

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Oh, I apologize, Your Honor. 

22

I  I provided Your Honor an incorrect statistic.  I'm 

23

talking about people whose current conviction is for 

24

felon in possession, triggering the Armed Career 

25

Criminal Act.

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

2

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

I see what you mean. 
I apologize.  I  I do not 

3

know how many people nationwide are prosecuted for 

4

violation of one of the several States that outright 

5

bans these or for violating some other portion.  I do 

6

know that they're not very common in the State of 

7

Minnesota, which is where our statute arises. 

8
9

 Your Honors, it's also important to keep in 
mind that in Minnesota as well as almost every place 

10

else that this is criminalized or criminalized if not 

11

properly registered, that constructive possession of the 

12

weapon alone is enough to make somebody guilty.  This 

13

doesn't have to be on or near their person.  It 

14

certainly need not be used in a crime or possessed with 

15

the intent to use it in a future crime.  And, in fact, 

16

some of the cases that we've proffered to the Court 

17

involve possessing this in nothing more than a locked 

18

gun case.  That is simply not the sort of active, 

19

purposeful, violent and aggressive or risky conduct that 

20

the Armed Career Criminal Act's residual clause is 

21

designed to apply to. 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

When you say "constructive 

possession," what does that mean? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

That means where you don't 

have an item directly on your person, Your Honor, but

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you have the intent, at least in the Eighth Circuit, 

2

it's the intent to exercise dominion and control and the 

3

power to do so.  So, for instance, I have constructive 

4

possession of the items in my briefcase, even though I 

5

don't have them with me and I have constructive 

6

possession of items in my home, even though that's back 

7

in Minnesota.  And so that demonstrates, Your Honor, the 

8

broad application of mere possession crimes and how far 

9

removed they can be from the parade of horribles, with 

10

due respect, that the government suggests these are 

11

inherently intrinsically tied to. 

12

 Your Honor, I'd also invite the Court to 

13

examine closely the cases cited by opposing counsel in 

14

their brief, because while they do cite 16 cases in 

15

their brief in which mere  I'm sorry, in which 

16

shortbarreled shotguns were used in violent crimes, 

17

it's important for the Court to note that in only two of 

18

those cases was there actually a conviction for a 

19

weapons offense or mere possession of a weapon.  So in 

20

only two of those cases was the prior offense actually 

21

before the Court today even being considered. 

22

 In the other 14, and indeed also in those 

23

two, the person was convicted of the far more serious 

24

crime of violence that the weapon was used during, 

25

ranging from assault to capital murder.  And as Justice

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Gruender, in his dissent in the Vincent case in the 

2

Eighth Circuit made very clear, in such a case, that 

3

much more serious offense would readily trigger 

4

application of the Armed Career Criminal Act and we 

5

wouldn't need to resort to the overinclusive 

6

interpretation proffered by the Government. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What are  what do you 

8

think is the basis for a State legislature's prohibiting 

9

the possession of a shortbarreled shotgun or a 

10
11

shortbarreled shotgun that is not properly registered? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, I can't say what 

12

all the State legislatures' bases were, although I would 

13

note that Michigan just last year changed its mind and 

14

made these lawful.  But I think that many State 

15

legislatures, and indeed Congress in 1934 when it 

16

decided to regulate these weapons, were persuaded by at 

17

least the reputation of this gun, that it was associated 

18

with gangster activity in the Prohibition era. 

19

 With due respect, although I am not at all 

20

disagreeing that States are within their rights to ban 

21

possession of this weapon, that reputation is somewhat 

22

dated, and in fact today, you can get far more lethal 

23

and far more intimidating weapons without even 

24

triggering the application. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, do you think that

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

those State legislatures came to the conclusion that 

2

there was a strong correlation between the possession of 

3

a shortbarreled shotgun and the use of that weapon in 

4

committing crimes? 

5

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

I think they may have come to 

6

that conclusion.  I'm unaware of them doing so based on 

7

data, Your Honor, including the Minnesota Act.  I am 

8

unaware of even the National Firearms Act, when it was 

9

adopted in 1934, relying on actual statistics about the 

10

danger presented by this weapon 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you think Congress 

12

 MS. MENENDEZ:: 

 as opposed to 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

 had statistics before it 

14

when it listed the specifically enumerated offenses in 

15

the Armed Career Criminal Act?  Is this the sort of 

16

thing with respect to which it is reasonable to expect 

17

that there will be empirical evidence, or is this the 

18

sort of thing, the sort of decision that legislatures 

19

make based in  on an impressionistic way and taking 

20

into account common sense? 

21

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, I don't know 

22

whether Congress, when it passed the residual clause, 

23

assumed that we would come to such statistical analysis 

24

of the 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, when they said

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

burglary is a violent offense, do you think they had 

2

statistics about the percentage of all burglar  of all 

3

burglaries that occur within the United States that 

4

result in violence? 

5

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

I don't believe so, Your 

6

Honor.  I think burglary motivated the Armed Career 

7

Criminal Act in the first place.  Burglary and robbery 

8

seem to be the two  the two predicate offenses that 

9

most specifically the court  I mean, I'm sorry, 

10

Congress intended to include as triggering prior 

11

offenses.  Why?  I think it's because they had the 

12

belief that an armed burglar would be more dangerous 

13

than an unarmed burglar and wanted to capture people who 

14

were repeat and persistent property offenders who would 

15

then later possess a gun. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if that is a 

17

reasonable conclusion for the national legislature to 

18

reach in enacting the Armed Career Criminal Act, why is 

19

it not equally defensible for a State legislature to 

20

make the same decision with respect to the illegal 

21

possession of a sawedoff shotgun? 

22

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

It's absolutely appropriate 

23

for them to make that decision.  That should not control 

24

this Court's decision about whether merely possessing 

25

that unlawful weapon is a violent felony.  That decision

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has to be governed by the residual clause language, and 

2

it doesn't satisfy 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you think that that 

4

judgment on the part of legislature is entitled to any 

5

respect from this Court? 

6

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, certainly it 

7

matters that some legislatures have chosen to ban it, 

8

but I think it matters even more that most legislatures 

9

and the United States Congress do not outlaw this 

10

weapon.  They permit it to be possessed when lawfully 

11

registered.  And even in 19 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that's what I'm 

13

talking about, the cases where it is possessed 

14

illegally, either because it is flatly banned or that it 

15

is possessed by somebody who will not register it for 

16

whatever reason, very possibly because that person 

17

doesn't want it known that he or she possesses the 

18

weapon. 

19

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Certainly, Your Honor.  Or 

20

because they're unaware of the registration requirement, 

21

which in almost every State will nonetheless make it a 

22

criminal conduct, or because they're unaware of the 

23

characteristics of the weapon that require it to be 

24

registered, which in some States doesn't protect one 

25

from the conviction.

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Your Honor, I think it's important, if we're 

2

using the opinion of legislatures and Congress to help 

3

us determine whether this is a violent felony, it's 

4

important to recognize that it is widely legal. 

5

 But you are right that the question before 

6

the Court is the unlawful possession and whether 

7

unlawful possession of a firearm is a violent felony. 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What should we do if we 

think that the reason that the legislature has made 

10

possession unlawful is because the legislature believes 

11

that possession will lead to a risk of physical injury? 

12

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, I don't think 

13

that answers the question.  I think the question has to 

14

be grounded in the residual clause, and the residual 

15

clause requires not just the possibility of future 

16

injury, but that the offense itself, when examined 

17

categorically and based on its element, creates a 

18

substantial 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, it says  it says if 

20

I use those words, I could repeat the same question and 

21

say the reason that the legislature makes it unlawful to 

22

possess a sawedoff shotgun is because the legislature 

23

believes that the possession, that's the crime, presents 

24

a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. 

25

That's why they made it unlawful.  What other reason

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could there have been?  And therefore, their judgment is 

2

the same words that the statute uses, but for the word 

3

otherwise. 

4

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Your Honor, I  I  I don't 

5

think there's any suggestion that either the Minnesota 

6

legislature or the other minority legislatures that have 

7

reached that conclusion did so based on an understanding 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What other reason would 

they have had for making possession unlawful? 
 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Because I think there's a 

11

strong belief that firearms in general are unlawful, 

12

that certain types of fire are  are dangerous, that 

13

certain types of firearms are more dangerous than 

14

others, and that's appropriate.  We aren't saying these 

15

should be legal.  We aren't saying these are 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, I'm just saying what 

17

other reason could they have had for making this a 

18

crime, the possession 

19

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Perhaps 
 unless they thought that 

21

possession presents a serious potential risk of physical 

22

injury to another?  I'm not suggesting an answer.  I 

23

want to know what your answer is. 

24
25

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Perhaps they were, in fact, 

adopting a different standard which is:  We, as the

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Minnesota legislature, hypothetically, are going to ban 

2

this weapon because we believe that it is somewhat more 

3

dangerous than other weapons, and we would prefer it is 

4

not possessed.  I don't think we can assume that they 

5

went this far, and this is the question the Court has to 

6

answer. 

7

 Also, Your Honor, the Michigan legislature, 

8

for instance, obviously disagreed when they recently 

9

changed their law to no longer prohibit mere possession 

10
11

of a shortbarreled shotgun. 
 I do think it is a recognition, Your Honor, 

12

that legislatures think these are dangerous weapons, and 

13

they are dangerous weapons, but that does not make their 

14

mere possession violative of the residual clause of the 

15

Armed Career Criminal Act.  I think it's very important 

16

in every case that we tie the examination not to a 

17

possible thing that could be done with the gun in the 

18

future, but to the actual risk presented by mere 

19

possession.  In the same way that in the James case the 

20

Court was motivated by the fact that something more than 

21

mere possession of burglary tools was required, here 

22

something more than mere possession of the weapon should 

23

be required. 

24
25

 We would be having a much different 
conversation if we were talking about a different part

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of Section 924 of Title 18, 924(c), which penalizes 

2

using a weapon, even a shortbarreled shotgun, during a 

3

crime of violence.  That could certainly be a violent 

4

felony.  But the mere possession 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You pointed out in your 

6

brief that explosives  one of the enumerated crimes is 

7

use of explosives, but is no  anywhere a crime of 

8

possession. 

9

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

That's correct, Your Honor, 

10

and I'm glad you reminded me because that was an 

11

important point for me to make, is that when we look at 

12

these enumerated offenses as providing guidance for the 

13

residual clause, it is very important that Congress 

14

adopted use of explosives rather than possession.  And 

15

in fact, in the legislative history, in 1986, they gave 

16

examples of the sorts of things they believed would be 

17

included by that provision, and it was not mere 

18

possession of explosives. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

20

prohibited the possession of explosives? 

21

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

22

using certain language. 

23

Has any legislature 

I am sure that some have, 

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

They just flatly prohibited, 

24

within our State, you cannot possess any explosives. 

25

Has any legislature done that?

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

I'm not aware of that, Your

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, do you think it's a 

4

possibility that there are States in which explosives 

5

cannot be used for demolition purposes? 

6

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

No, I don't think that's 

7

likely, Your Honor.  But nonetheless, Your Honor, when 

8

Congress was adopting this language, they chose to put 

9

"use of" prior to the term "explosives."  If they wanted 

10

it to be more inclusive, they  could have certainly made 

11

it more inclusive.  They did not.  In fact, the examples 

12

given were the use of explosives to destroy energy 

13

facilities or transportation facilities.

 I see that I  will reserve the rest of my 
time for rebuttal, if I might.  Thank you, Your Honors.

 ORAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN F. BASH 

19

 ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES 

20
21
22

 MR. BASH: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The ordinary case of possession of a 

23

sawedoff shotgun is possession in connection with 

24

serious criminal activity.  That is the judgment that 

25

Congress, State legislatures, this Court in Miller and

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Heller, and lower courts have reached for 8 decades. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If that's the case, how 

3

many charges do you have that are for mere possession, 

4

not involved with an underlying crime? 

5

 MR. BASH: 

Most of these charges are brought 

6

at the State level, so I don't have sort of the 

7

comprehensive statistics.  But what I will point out is 

8

that Petitioner has now had two briefs to come forward 

9

with examples of lawabiding citizens just kind of 

10
11
12
13

caught up in this sawedoff shotgun regime. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

She raises 14 cases in 

her reply brief. 
 MR. BASH: 

If you look at all of those 

14

cases, Your Honor, the vast majority of them, both cited 

15

in the opening brief and in the reply brief, involved 

16

people involved in other very serious criminal activity, 

17

meth dealing, sexual abuse, assaults.  So those cases 

18

only verify what I think has been this Court's judgment 

19

in Heller and Miller, Congress's judgment, the judgment 

20

of State legislatures for a long time, that these are 

21

exclusively used for unlawful purposes. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So why haven't they been 

23

outlawed federally and why is it only a minority of 

24

States that have outlawed their  just their 

25

possession, not their registration?

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BASH: 

Because I think what the National 

2

Firearm Act reflects, and this was reflected in Attorney 

3

General Cummings' arguments in favor of the law when it 

4

was under consideration, is that if you're willing to 

5

disclose your fingerprints and photograph to the Federal 

6

Government and undergo a background check  that's only 

7

by regulation, but undergo a background check, it 

8

dissipates the chance that you're going to be involved 

9

in crimes. 

10

 Gang members, terrorists, and bank robbers 

11

do not go around disclosing their fingerprints and 

12

photograph to the government.  So there are some 

13

atypical gun collections who build collection of, I 

14

think, rare firearms, and those are the sorts of 

15

applications the ATF sees. 

16

 But I just want to emphasize the point 

17

about, sort of, how many of these things are lawfully 

18

registered.  We made a good faith attempt at an estimate 

19

in our brief, and it's 140,000 lawfully registered ever. 

20

It appears that the vast majority of those are to law 

21

enforcement agencies or to the manufacturers themselves. 

22

 Just by way of comparison, the Congressional 

23

Research Service put out a gun control analysis in 2012 

24

that estimated that there are currently 82 million 

25

shotguns of all varieties, either in private hands or

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

available for purchase by private citizens.  So the 

2

number of  whether it's 40,000, 50,000 ever, is a 

3

vanishingly small number of sawedoff shotguns that have 

4

been lawfully registered.  I think 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Wasn't there something in 

6

one of these briefs that a manufacturer in States where 

7

these weapons are lawful has advertised them as ideal 

8

for use in selfdefense? 

9

 MR. BASH: 

There is something like that in 

10

one of the briefs.  I don't think a manufacturer's, sort 

11

of, market strategy should govern the analysis.  It 

12

certainly shouldn't refute this Court's judgment, 

13

Congress's judgment, the judgment of State legislatures 

14

for decades, that these weapons have no lawful uses. 

15

And I am not aware of, for example, a spike in 

16

applications for registrations for sawedoff shotguns to 

17

the ATF, which you might expect to see if these weapons 

18

were suddenly being in common use for selfdefense. 

19

 I just wanted to address a point that I 

20

think Justice Kagan raised with my friend, which was, 

21

are we, sort of, solely relying on a correlative 

22

relationship between the enumerated offense and the 

23

potential for violence.  I think it's a great deal more 

24

than a correlative relationship.  I think it's actually 

25

precisely the same relationship between the crime and

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the potential for violence present for burglary, 

2

attempted burglary, extortion, which is to say this: 

3

The enumerated crime enables the potential for violence 

4

in a butfor causal sense, but the offender has to take 

5

an additional act of volition to bring the violence to 

6

fruition. 

7

 So, for example, with a burglary or an 

8

attempted burglary, a burglar could say, if I'm 

9

confronted by a homeowner or police officer, I am going 

10

to flee.  I am not going to attack anybody or I am going 

11

to give up.  The burglary enables that confrontation to 

12

occur, but the offender has to take an additional act of 

13

volition to actually bring violence to fruition. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I would think the analogy to 

15

that is the person who uses the sawedoff shotgun in a 

16

crime, but decides:  I'm not going to shoot it.  And 

17

then you say:  It doesn't really matter if you're not 

18

going to shoot it; you just used it in a criminal 

19

activity, that's enough for us. 

20

 But this is a good deal more attenuated than 

21

that because this person could, for whatever reason, 

22

maybe because he wants to commit a crime in the future 

23

or maybe he's one of the odd collectors or people who 

24

think that this is good for selfdefense, this person 

25

could have kept it in a locked closet, in a safe deposit

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

box, and never have brought it out and never have any 

2

potential for use in a crime.  I mean, it would be one 

3

thing to say use in a crime causes enough risk of 

4

serious injury, but this is a step further. 

5

 MR. BASH: 

I agree that a necessary premise 

6

of our argument is that the ordinary case of possession 

7

is possession in connection with crimes.  So if you 

8

don't buy that, we're in trouble.  But you should buy 

9

that.  It's what this Court said in Heller when it said 

10

shortbarreled shotguns are not typically used by law 

11

abiding citizens for lawful purposes. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But they are two separate 

13

offenses, right, possession of this gun and use of this 

14

gun.  And you're converting the one into the other for 

15

purposes of ACCA. 

16

 MR. BASH: 

And that makes total sense, and 

17

let me explain why.  If it wasn't like that, clause 2 of 

18

the definition of violent felony  it's at 11a of our 

19

statutory appendix  would do no work.  The whole point 

20

of that clause is to capture situations that were 

21

pregnant with the possibility of violence but where the 

22

apprehender was offended before the violence occurred. 

23

If an offender used a firearm against somebody, he would 

24

be squarely within clause 1, which is the use of force 

25

or the threatened or attempted use of force against

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

somebody. 
 The whole point of clause 2 is when you 

3

catch someone who put themselves in the position to do 

4

violence but the violence didn't materialize on that 

5

occasion, they still fall within clause 2, and that 

6

makes sense because that sort of behavior is reflective 

7

of the armed career criminal.  I mean, this is the 

8

weapon of choice historically, along with machine guns, 

9

of the armed career criminal.  So it would be kind of 

10

odd if the illegal possession of this weapon didn't 

11

satisfy  didn't count as a predicate under the Armed 

12

Career Criminal Act. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

14
15

Do you think the same would 

be true of a felon in possession? 
 MR. BASH: 

No, and I think that's an 

16

important difference.  I think the felon in possession 

17

statute reflects a slightly different judgment.  It's 

18

the judgment that someone who has committed a felony, 

19

whether it's a violent felony or, you know, bank fraud 

20

or something, has revealed themselves to be an 

21

irresponsible person who can't be trusted with a 

22

firearm.  I think in that sense, it's more prophylactic 

23

in nature, but you certainly don't have 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I would  think that in the 

felon  a felon in possession law, I mean, honestly,

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I'm sure the numbers dwarf the sawedoff shotguns, and 

2

the whole point of that is, yes, they're people who have 

3

shown themselves to be irresponsible, who have shown 

4

themselves perhaps to use weapons irresponsibly, and 

5

they're going to do it again, and there's a pretty 

6

strong correlation of a kind of recidivism that makes 

7

Congress pass that law. 

8
9

 MR. BASH: 

I think that's an accurate 

description of felon in possession, but there are, 

10

nevertheless, felons who legitimately want a handgun, 

11

which has been in common use for decades, for 

12

selfdefense or for target practice or whatever. 

13

 The judgment that this Court has rendered 

14

and that Congress has rendered is that these weapons do 

15

not have other purposes in the ordinary case, and I 

16

think that distinguishes really a sawedoff shotgun 

17

offense almost from any other 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Where did Congress say 

19

that?  Where?  Where?  I mean, a felon in possession has 

20

a gun, and you say he might keep it upstairs in his 

21

closet, in the back of a car, in his hand, many places 

22

he might possess it, and he might never use it for a 

23

crime.  Recognizing that, you say that doesn't fall 

24

within the statute.  Just substitute the words 

25

"sawedoff shotgun."  In the closet, back of a car,

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

glass case, maybe in his hand, maybe in somebody else's 

2

hand.  Maybe he just says to somebody:  I have a 

3

sawedoff shotgun up there; give me your money. 

4

 All right? 

All those things are possible 

5

with either.  And so since they're possible with either, 

6

on what basis do we write an opinion that says that you 

7

win with the sawedoff shotgun, but you lose with almost 

8

every other kind of gun.  What's our theory?  What lines 

9

would there be in that opinion? 

10

 MR. BASH: 

Here's the line.  When you have a 

11

firearm that has historically been exclusively 

12

associated with violence, unlike a handgun, but just 

13

like a sawedoff shotgun 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

My goodness, stop right 

15

there for a second, because what we heard was there are 

16

40,000 or more people in 10 States and others that don't 

17

even make it unlawful.  So how can we say it's more 

18

associated with crime than, what, a handgun or a 

19

regular  or a torpedo?  I don't know. 

20
21

 MR. BASH: 

I think we would contend that 

unlawful possession of a torpedo 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I realized you were going 

24

to say that, and all I put that in was to express my own 

25

lack of knowledge of which is which, and therefore I

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can't just speak ex cathedra and say this.  I would have 

2

to have some proof. 

3

 MR. BASH: 

I understand the uncertainty in a 

4

case without empirical data.  It was the same 

5

uncertainty that the Court had in James, where it said 

6

we don't have empirical data to make the judgment.  And 

7

in both James and Sykes, the Court said at the end of 

8

the day in some of these ACCA cases we need to rely on 

9

our common sense judgment.  But here I think what I hope 

10
11

would be the Court's common sense judgment 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I don't  I mean, 

12

I've seen a lot of movies.  James Cagney used to, but I 

13

can't use that. 

14

 MR. BASH: 

Well, let me just say  let me 

15

just say where I  where I think you can ground the 

16

common sense judgment.  We've set forward in the brief 

17

Federal statutes, State statutes, the legislative 

18

history, Senate and House reports saying these weapons 

19

are exclusively associated with lawbreaking and crime. 

20

There is a history of that.  That's why they've been 

21

regulated.  And I think, to go to a colloquy that my 

22

colleague was having with one of the members of the 

23

bench, the judgment of State legislatures and the 

24

Federal Congress is not something sort of to be cast 

25

away as the product of superstition.  State legislators,

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Congresspeople, talk with their constituents, they speak 

2

with law enforcement agencies.  They exercise reasonable 

3

judgment based on the facts on the ground when they 

4

enact laws like this. 

5

 And I don't think it can be really disputed, 

6

as Justice Alito was alluding to earlier, that those 

7

legislatures have made a judgment that these weapons are 

8

exclusively associated with crime.  And I think that's a 

9

much better factual record

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We couldn't say the same 

thing with a Saturday night special? 
 MR. BASH: 

I don't know.  I'm not familiar 

with the term. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

They used to be.  A 

15

Saturday night special is a kind of pistol that was 

16

really used very, very heavily with robberies and 

17

crimes.  They were viewed  that was one of the first 

18

things that people tried to get banned after 

19

assassinations and so forth. 

20

 MR. BASH: 

I'm not saying that our argument 

21

couldn't apply to any other weapons.  I imagine we'd 

22

have a similar case on unlawful possession of machine 

23

guns, for example. 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

How many 
No, no.  This isn't a

36

Alderson Reporting Company

3

machine gun.  It's a pistol, a handgun. 
 MR. BASH: 

We'd have to do the work.  I 

don't mean to cut off 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

 MR. BASH: 

No. 
We'd have to do the work.  Here I 

6

think we have done the work.  We have a legislative and 

7

judicial consensus over decades that these are 

8

exclusively used in crimes. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But we  but we 

10

know that's not true.  We know there are 40,000 

11

registered that by  and, you know, and you yourself I 

12

think said or  that if you're willing to give your 

13

photograph and fingerprint or whatever to the Federal 

14

Government, you're probably not going to use it 

15

illegally.  So we know it's not true that these are 

16

exclusively used in criminal activity. 

17

 MR. BASH: 

Well, I think there's two points 

18

in that.  One was the point I was alluding to earlier, 

19

which is not only that Congress thinks sort of this 

20

process ameliorates the  the normal effect of 

21

possession of a sawedoff shotgun and that these are 

22

actually registered in extraordinarily small numbers 

23

relative to total gun population. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

Well, what number 

would be enough?  I mean if we had 100,000

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

registrations, does that mean that it's no longer 

2

conduct that presents a serious potential risk? 

3

 MR. BASH: 

I'm not sure.  I want to give you 

4

two answers to that question.  I mean, the first is 

5

that, as this Court said in James, the relevant data 

6

point is convictions.  So there's no convictions for 

7

lawful possession of a sawedoff shotgun.  The relevant 

8

data point is how many convictions for unlawful 

9

possession are associated with otherwise nonviolent 

10

activity, and Petitioner hasn't really pointed to any 

11

cases of sort of lawabiding citizens using them for 

12

other reasons. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, then  then 

14

is possession, possession of explosives, an offense 

15

under this enhancement provision? 

16

 MR. BASH: 

I think we'd run the same 

17

analysis, and we talk about this at pages 47 to 48 of 

18

our brief, which is to say explosives regulated by the 

19

NFA, which are defined to be explosives designed as 

20

weapons, yes, it's pretty much the same analysis we'd 

21

run through which 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Even though the 

23

statute  even though the statute says use of 

24

explosives is covered? 

25

 MR. BASH: 

And I don't think 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You'd say, well, 

under the catchall phrase, mere possession is covered. 
 MR. BASH: 

No.  And there's no redundancy, 

4

because  maybe we explained this unclearly.  What we 

5

tried to explain is that the use of explosives would 

6

encompass a felony conviction for the use of any 

7

explosives.  So there are felony convictions for the use 

8

of TNT or dynamite, explosives that are not inherently 

9

dangerous in character, but could be used unlawfully. 

10

 The possession offense under the reasoning 

11

that we've set forth in the brief would apply to 

12

weaponized explosives, those regulated under the NFA 

13

because they're designed as  as weapons, napalm and 

14

things like that, not to the unlawful possession of TNT, 

15

even though the unlawful use of TNT would fall under the 

16

use of explosives statute provided as a felony.  So I 

17

don't think there's any redundancy created there. 

18

 And I guess just to wrap up this colloquy, I 

19

think it's possible to imagine an alternative universe 

20

where sawedoff shotguns developed as selfdefense 

21

weapons in ordinary use.  In that case, the ordinary 

22

case analysis would look very different.  You would say, 

23

well, maybe there are some people who unlawfully acquire 

24

these, just like some people unlawfully acquire handguns 

25

for selfdefense.  But this Court has never recognized this,

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this Court said very clearly in Heller in 

2

distinguishing Miller, that these are not in lawful use 

3

by lawabiding citizens. 

4

 That's not the way the real world looks. 

In 

5

the real world these are unlawfully possessed for use in 

6

crime.  And once you accept that proposition, the final 

7

step of our analysis is that when these items are 

8

brought to crimes, it seriously increases the chance 

9

that someone is going to be killed or wounded.  We've 

10

set forth the characteristics of the weapon and the sort 

11

of damage they do.  I won't repeat that.  But I don't 

12

even really hear Petitioner to dispute that in the 

13

ordinary case, when the  in what we call the ordinary 

14

case, when these are brought to crimes, they massively 

15

increase the chance 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that's a 

17

second step, unlike the others.  When you're engaged in 

18

a burglary, the  the risk is there.  When it's mere 

19

possession, the risk isn't there.  You have to take an 

20

additional step of taking it and using it in a crime. 

21

 MR. BASH: 

And I think burglary has the 

22

exact same connection.  Burglar  maybe it's easier to 

23

see it with extortion, but the same analysis would apply 

24

to burglary.  When you  extortion, as defined most 

25

narrowly, as Justice Scalia would have defined it in

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

James to be a threat of violence to person or property, 

2

that itself does not create the possibility of violence. 

3

It's only if the extortionist is willing to follow 

4

through on the threat to take an additional step, just 

5

like the additional step of using a firearm, that the 

6

violence materializes. 

7

 So the sort of connection between the 

8

underlying offense and violence that Congress had in 

9

mind did contemplate an additional step by the offender 

10
11

himself. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, or the 

12

homeowner could happen to have a shortbarreled shotgun 

13

and shoot the burglar. 

14

 MR. BASH: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

16
17

But remember 
Then the violence 

doesn't depend on any additional act by the burglar. 
 MR. BASH: 

It does, Mr. Chief Justice, 

18

because the statute says violence to another.  So if 

19

the  if the homeowner clocks the burglar, that's not 

20

the violence the statute contemplates.  And I suppose 

21

you could imagine fanciful scenarios where the police 

22

officer accidentally shoots the homeowner, but surely 

23

that's not the sort of ordinary case violence that this 

24

statute had in mind. 

25

 So I think 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So the parallel 

2

you're drawing is that burglary itself doesn't present a 

3

risk of violence until the burglar pulls a gun? 

4

 MR. BASH: 

Or  or attacks the homeowner. 

5

Like I said, I think it's most clear in extortion.  I 

6

mean, even  the Court suggested in James that 

7

extortion could be even much broader to include 

8

blackmail and sort of prototypical extortion.  But even 

9

if we just accept Justice Scalia's view of extortion, 

10

which is that it's a threat to person or property, there 

11

must be some number of extortionists that say:  Well, 

12

I'm going to make the threat, but I'm actually not going 

13

to follow through on the threat.  And the violence 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What about the  what 

15

about the analogy to  explosives, you say that there 

16

could be lawful possession because explosives, it's use 

17

that's given as an enumerated crime. 

18

 MR. BASH: 

And what we would say is, by 

19

parity of reasoning to what we've set forth in the brief 

20

with respect to firearms, weaponized explosives, that is 

21

to say explosives that only have a use as a weapon, 

22

could fall under the residual clause. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Is there  the proposition 

24

then that I must accept I think for you to prevail is 

25

possession of that which is normally used or has a very

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

serious risk of being used in a way that risks physical 

2

injury to another falls within the statute.  And instead 

3

of drawing a line between possession and some other use 

4

of the thing, we say sometimes possession is in itself 

5

within the statute, sometimes it's not.  If you possess 

6

those things that have as a predominant use 

7

participation in a matter that's likely to cause 

8

physical injury to another, that's within the statute. 

9

If that's the proposition, is there any case where 

10

simple possession of anything has been interpreted as 

11

falling within this language?  I don't know the answer 

12

to that. 

13
14

 MR. BASH: 

You mean circuit or Supreme Court 

cases? 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I know  you've won 

In circuit courts.  I think the 

Eighth Circuit and the First Circuit. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But it's this issue. 

There's not some other area I could look at? 
 MR. BASH: 

I think there's a case out of the 

Fourth Circuit with possession of weapon in prisons.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Obviously the setting can change the analysis to some 

2

degree.  But I believe there's a Fourth Circuit.  Maybe 

3

my co  my opponent will have a better recollection of 

4

that. 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

There's a Fourth Circuit 

case and then this line right here.  Okay. 
 MR. BASH: 

I  I don't mean to suggest that 

8

there's no other cases.  I would not be surprised if 

9

there were possession of machine gun and shortbarreled 

10

rifle and silencer; in other words, the very firearms 

11

covered by the NFA.  Also, I think shortbarreled 

12

shotguns are, just to underscore the point, more often 

13

used in crimes, and so you're going to see a 

14

proliferation of cases there. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why not burglar tools? 

16

Isn't it  burglar tools are outside, right? 

17

Possession of burglar tools will not get you under ACCA. 

18

 MR. BASH: 

This Court reserved that question 

19

in James in a footnote, because I think some States 

20

purportedly had defined attempted burglary to be 

21

something like possession or to include something like 

22

possession of burglar tools.  I think we'd have a much 

23

harder case there because there's a longer chain of 

24

attenuation. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Pardon 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But there's no other use. 

There's no other use for burglar tools than in burglary. 
 MR. BASH: 

I think that's true.  I think 

4

we'd have to build through the practical case, one, that 

5

burglar tools  the mere possession of burglar tools is 

6

sort of inevitably associated with committing burglary. 

7

It may be that there's a lot of people who acquire them, 

8

think about committing burglary, but don't make the sort 

9

of attempt that James contemplated will result in a 

10

confrontation, and then it's more attenuated because 

11

you're linking up this burglary  burglary tools with 

12

committing burglary and then burglary with the 

13

confrontation. 

14

 I think it's a much tighter nexus here. 

I 

15

think if you ask an ordinary congressperson whether they 

16

think there's a tighter connection between possession of 

17

a sawedoff shotgun and acts of violence rather than, 

18

you know, possession of a crowbar and acts of violence, 

19

I think most people would say, yes, that's sort of the 

20

common sense answer that most legislators would give. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm a little still 

22

confused about the felony possession, okay?  You say 

23

that's not a crime of violence.  I  I don't know how 

24

to differentiate that from this because most felons, in 

25

possession of a gun, I'm sure the statistics would show,

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are committing crimes.  So if the question is the risk 

2

of injury to others, it would be a felon possessing a 

3

handgun of any kind and not a common citizen.  Because, 

4

yes, common citizens more often than not, we hope, use 

5

guns that they possess for lawful purposes; but felons, 

6

I would think, just as a matter of logic, what Justice 

7

Alito was asking, that felons more often than not use 

8

guns in illegal activities. 

9

 MR. BASH: 

I  I don't know.  And for 

10

one  for one thing, we have a  the judgment of the 

11

sentencing commission here that we're in full accord 

12

with that possession of a sawedoff shotgun is 

13

fundamentally different than felony possession. 

14

 And they see 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I understand that. 

16

I just want you to give me some sort of analytical 

17

approach on when to judge that  when to judge that 

18

risk, or how to differentiate that risk 

19

 MR. BASH: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think the analytical 
 so that everything, 

21

no  every possession crime doesn't become a crime of 

22

violence. 

23

 MR. BASH: 

I understand the concern.  And I 

24

think the analytical line to draw is that weapons that 

25

by their nature are exclusively associated, or in the

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ordinary case, associated with violent crimes count 

2

under ACCA.  I don't think that the felon in possession 

3

statute reflects quite the judgment that every felon 

4

that possesses a firearm is going to commit acts of 

5

violence with it.  I think it reflects the sort of 

6

prophylactic concern that these folks have proven 

7

themselves irresponsible lawbreakers  even if they 

8

committed a nonviolence felony and they've, you know, 

9

lost their ability to responsibly care for firearms and 

10

to handle firearms.  I do think it's a different 

11

judgment than the judgment of why people can't 

12

unlawfully possess mortars and artillery pieces and 

13

torpedoes and  and sawedoff rifles and shotguns and 

14

machine guns.  I think it's a different judgment. 

15

 The Court  Petitioner has really not 

16

refuted the historical understanding that these are 

17

uniquely and purely associated with crime.  And I think 

18

a few thousand registrations since 1934, lawfully, does 

19

not refute the common sense conclusion that the unlawful 

20

possession of a sawedoff shotgun is associated with 

21

crime.

Yes.  And I'll just say it's 

3

140,000; we think it's a great deal lower than that. 

4

That's the total number of registrations since 1934.  As 

5

we say in the brief, we can't have perfect certainty,

enforcement or manufacturers.

21

 MR. BASH:

22

That doesn't mean they don't exist, but I, standing 

23

here, am not aware of the efforts.  But I 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What would you think, which 

I once suggested and certainly didn't have the nerve to

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

follow through, that it's more likely that the 

2

Department of Justice, with the aid of the sentencing 

3

commission, could get the relevant statistics than it is 

4

that a defendant could.  So if no statistics appear, we 

5

should draw a presumption against the department. 

6

 MR. BASH: 

7

otherwise in James. 

Well, this Court has held 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

 MR. BASH: 

10
11

Yes, yes.  I realize that. 
So, I mean, I think that's a 

statutory stare decisis holding that  that governs 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But could you do something, 

12

that is to say, even without legislation?  Is it 

13

possible that the department, through its statistical 

14

gathering resources, and it has some, working with the 

15

sentencing commission, could help us more on the  on 

16

the underlying statistical data that would give us a 

17

clue as to what was dangerous and what was not? 

18

 MR. BASH: 

I think  I think that's 

19

conceivable.  I'm not familiar with all the sort of 

20

statistical resources of the Department of Justice.  But 

21

I just want to emphasize, this is the clear case.  This 

22

is the case where Congress and State legislatures and 

23

this Court in Heller and Miller have said for decades. 

24

So I don't think there's a fair argument that criminals 

25

are not on notice that possession of an unlawful shotgun

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can carry very serious consequences.  Maybe in a closer 

2

case down the road you say, well, the department could 

3

have come up with statistics, and that would be  you 

4

know, we're going to rule against the department for 

5

that reason.  But, I mean, we have a quote from Judge 

6

Boudin in the brief in the Shaw case, where, you know, 

7

anyone that watches television or reads the newspaper 

8

knows that these are especially associated with crimes. 

9

So I don't think it came as a surprise to Mr. Johnson 

10

that when he commits two robberies and one illegal 

11

possession of a sawedoff shotgun, eventually that's 

12

going to catch up with him. 

13

 If the Court has no further questions.

remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHERINE M. MENENDEZ 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

19

 MS. MENENDEZ: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

20

 Just briefly. 

You're  with respect to 

21

Justice Breyer's question, there are a couple of related 

22

contexts where there are some appellate decisions.  The 

23

Eighth Circuit in Archer, which is cited in our brief, 

24

has held that possession of a concealed weapon is not a 

25

violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 In addition, in the Fourth  I'm sorry, the 

2

Ninth Circuit in a case called Fish, which I am not sure 

3

whether we've cited it in our brief, but it's a 2004 

4

decision, held that possession of a pipe bomb was not a 

5

crime of violence under the sentencing guideline 

6

provision, not the Armed Career Criminal Act. 

7

 And I do agree with my opposing counsel that 

8

there's been one decision that went the way we disagree 

9

with in the Fourth Circuit about possession of a weapon 

10

in prison, which I think is a very different 

11

circumstance. 

12

 Your Honors, I do think that it's important 

13

to look at James, comparing attempted burglary as to 

14

burglary.  I think it gives us a great deal of guidance. 

15

In James, the Court found that there wasn't any textual 

16

justification for treating those differently.  Here we 

17

have a very clear textual justification in terms of use 

18

of explosives, which gives us a strong signal that mere 

19

possession wasn't contemplated.  The government invites 

20

this Court to do pretty convoluted reasoning, adopting 

21

an unstated definition from a totally unrelated statute 

22

in Title 26.  And assuming that Congress meant when it 

23

said use of explosives, that all things listed in the 

24

National Firearms Act would be included by mere 

25

possession, I don't think we can make that leap.

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Your Honors, it's also not true that there 

2

is a unanimous belief that these are inherently 

3

unjustifiable weapons.  In fact, I think that the fact 

4

is most legislatures allow these to be possessed in some 

5

context or another, and Michigan has just indicated that 

6

perhaps the old historical reputation of this weapon is 

7

no longer deserved.  But this Court doesn't have to like 

8

the shortbarreled shotgun or decide that it's even an 

9

appropriate weapon for punish  or for possession in 

10

order to agree that we can't assume from its possession 

11

alone that someone has only nefarious purpose. 

12

 In addition, Your Honors, the relevant 

13

analysis has to begin with the offense.  And the 

14

government tries over and over again to say, well, it's 

15

obvious that these would only be possessed for nefarious 

16

reason, but they cannot substantiate that.  They 

17

disagree with the 14 cases I encourage the Court to look 

18

at from page 14 of our reply brief, that those are mere 

19

possession cases.  By characterizing the people who 

20

possessed those weapons, they were found during the 

21

course of investigations of other crimes, but that 

22

doesn't mean a single one of those possession acts was 

23

actually possession during a crime.  And this Court 

24

certainly can't assume that merely because a criminal or 

25

a bad person had possessed the weapon, that they

possessed it for nefarious purposes. 

2

 Finally, Your Honors, I would really 

3

encourage the Court to consider the  the rule of 

4

lenity and its application in this case.  The government 

5

has not brought statistics nor clear, decisive, textual 

6

argument that mandate the application of one of the most 

7

onerous sentencing provisions that we see in Federal 

8

courts every day.  This statute is applied to 600 people 

9

a year.  It lacks all clarity.  And while this Court 

10

need not get into whether it is unconstitutionally vague 

11

and the baby should go out with the bath water, the 

12

Court can certainly decide that Congress did not speak 

13

clearly on this question, and that it should not be 

14

applied to Mr. Johnson. 

15

 Unless there are any further questions, I 

16

appreciate the opportunity to present argument.
