CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Stirba.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER STIRBA,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9
10

MR. STIRBA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At the time of the arrest in this case there

11

were three different Federal circuits and two State

12

courts that established it was Constitutionally

13

permissible for police officers to enter a home without

14

a warrant as a follow-up entry to effectuate arrest

15

after an illegal drug transaction when a government

16

agent had occurred and probable cause had been

17

established.

18

Although the rule has become known as the

19

doctrine of consent once removed, and the lower courts

20

have banned various rationales in support of the rule,

21

the name or label is not important.

22

is that the rule is predicated upon well recognized

23

Fourth Amendment principles, and that at the time of the

24

arrest the consent doctrine was well established in the

25

lower courts as settled Fourth Amendment law.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

What is important

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Thus, irrespective of how this Court rules

2

on the constitutionality of the rule itself, the

3

Petitioner officers could have reasonably believed that

4

what they were doing was lawful.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, because the

6

Fourth Amendment principle of consent was well

7

established?

8

to the door and says "May I come in," that is -- that is

9

perfectly acceptable.

In other words, if a police officer goes

Is that -- that the level of

10

generality that you think we ought to analyze this issue

11

at?

No, certainly we think that the

which it should be determined.

15

problem with the Tenth Circuit case.

16

be -- the right has to be defined in a specific clear

17

way, and it has to be -- the contours of the right have

18

to be sufficiently clear that police officers know that

19

when they engage in the conduct, they know what they

20

they're doing is unlawful.

21

In fact, that was the
But it has to

In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, all of the

22

law that was in existing at the time of the entry was

23

supportive of exactly what the police officers did.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it seems to me that

misses the point of the case.

I mean, the point of the

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case is that consent to the police was established,

2

consent to police informants was not, and that when I

3

consent I am not consenting to the -- to the whole

4

world.

5

police officer, that is not equivalent to consenting to

6

a police officer.

7

I understand it, there was -- there was only one case at

8

the time that this occurred which equated the

9

confidential informant for the police with the police;

If I am consenting to somebody who is not a

That's the point of the case; and as

10

and that was the Seventh Circuit case; isn't that

11

correct?

12

MR. STIRBA:

Justice Souter, we are not -

13

we are not contending this is an implied consent case,

14

although that has been a theory that has been advanced

15

in the lower courts.

16

was constitutionally lawful -- this is really a Lewis

17

case, and that is once you engage in some illegal

18

conduct with a government agent in your home, you have

19

waived any expectation of privacy.

20

We believe that the way that this

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but that -- that

21

equates -- in terms of existing law, that equates the

22

government agent, which in this case is not a police

23

officer, but a confidential informant, with a police

24

officer.

25

case:

And it seems to me that is the nub of the

Is that person equivalent, so that consent to one

in effect is consent to as many police as want to come

2

in, or is it not the case?

3

have got to argue here is that the confidential

4

informant and the police officer for Fourth Amendment

5

purposes should be treated as identical.

6
7

MR. STIRBA:

Absolutely.

And we do -- and

we think -

8
9

And it seems to me what you

JUSTICE SOUTER:
on that.

And there is no clear law

That's why we are here.

There's one -- at the

10

time that this search was made, as I understand it,

11

there was only one case which held there was such an

12

equivalence, is that correct?

13

MR. STIRBA:

There are two points,

14

Justice Souter.

lawfulness of the confidential -

16

First of all, with respect to the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, first -- I want to

17

hear what you say, but tell me, is it correct that at

18

that time there was one case that held the equivalence?

19

MR. STIRBA:

No, Your Honor.

There actually

20

-- there were actually three out of the Seventh Circuit,

21

the Pollard case out of the Sixth Circuit, which

22

involved a police officer and a confidential informant

23

Which was not a circuit

MR. STIRBA:

That is a circuit case.

District case?


That was a circuit court case,


U.S. v. Pollard.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

So there were three circuit

court holdings that the confidential informant was

7

equivalent to a police officer?

MR. STIRBA:
Seventh Circuit.

There were three out of the

Paul, Diaz, and I think it's Aziano

10

were all confidential information cases where the courts

11

ruled squarely that there was no difference between a

12

confidential informant and a police officer.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

you have other circuits that held that?

15
16

MR. STIRBA:

Okay, did you -- now, do

Yes, Your Honor.

The Pollard

case involved a confidential informant -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. STIRBA:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. STIRBA:

Where is Pollard from?

And they cited in support the

21

confidential informant cases from the Seventh Circuit.

22

We also read Gramble -- this is a 2000 -- I'm sorry, a

23

995 Ninth Circuit case which talked about a government

24

agent, it did not draw a distinction between a

25

confidential informant and a police officer -- as

2

determined in the dissenting opinion in the Tenth

3

Circuit.

4

That's exactly what Judge Kelly

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Now why -- why are

5

they correct?

6

treated as equivalent to a police officer?

7

Why should the confidential informant be

MR. STIRBA:

Well, fundamentally -- and of

8

course the test for Fourth Amendments purposes is the

9

Skinner test -- that once you are a government agent or

10

a government actor, there really is no material

11

difference in terms what the confidential informant

12

would do or the undercover police officer would do.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Oh, but there is an

14

enormous difference between the training and the

15

character of a police officer and, as this very case

16

illustrates, the confidential informants are often very

17

shady characters who can't be counted on to be

18

truth-tellers, and have a powerful incentive to get

19

someone for the police, because in most cases they are

20

seeking to have their own case dealt with

21

sympathetically.

22

officer with a confidential informer, who is usually

23

someone who knows where the drug house is because he's a

24

dealer himself?

25

So, how can you equate a police

Two points.

Moreover -

He was trying -- and he was

trying to make a deal to get leniency with the police.

13

MR. STIRBA:

Well, there is no question

14

about that.

15

For purposes of Fourth Amendment liability it doesn't

16

matter whether it's a police officer or a confidential

17

informant, as long as he is an agent of the government,

18

which clearly he was.

19

But once again, he is a government actor.

He was a government actor -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you -- you certainly

20

cannot argue -- maybe you are, but I don't see how can

21

you argue in response to Justice Ginsburg that the

22

integrity to be expected from a confidential informant,

23

taking that as a category of law including all sorts of

24

informants, is the integrity that we would expect in a

25

police officer.
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. STIRBA:

Well, as a general proposition,

2

Justice Souter, you can't make that kind of

3

determination.

We point out -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

MR. STIRBA:

Why can't I?

Because sometimes confidential

6

informants are retired police officers; sometimes

7

confidential informants are police cadets.

8

confidential informants -

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sometimes

Then if that -- if that is

10

true, as it clearly is, they run the gamut from the good

11

to the bad.

12

categorically that confidential informants should be

13

regarded as having the same integrity as a police

14

officer.

15

You can't make -- adopt the proposition

MR. STIRBA:

I wouldn't want to make that

16

statement.

I don't know that it's material, though, to

17

the analysis under the Fourth Amendment and whether or

18

not, once you are a government agent or a government

19

actor, there really is no legal significance that flows

20

from that to draw a distinction between one who is

21

actually employed by the police, taking a paycheck from

22

the police, and one who is not.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's one feature of

24

this is that I think is really puzzling:

25

is about is the Fourth Amendment, that requires, with

not a serious answer, is it?

You're asking for a rule and our questions go to

And the officers may

Well, it is.

In essence we are

talking about an anticipatory warrant, and under U.S. v.

Grubbs you not only need probable cause to believe that

the drugs will be there -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They don't even need an

anticipatory warrant.

14

search that place on the grounds that there are probably

15

drugs there, and if they saw drugs there a couple of

16

hours beforehand and they had no affirmative evidence

17

which they should bring forward under the Frank standard

18

to indicate that the drugs were being taken out, is

19

there any serious question that probable cause would be

20

found?

MR. STIRBA:

They need a warrant to go in and

Justice -- Justice Souter, I

22

don't believe at the time, approximately 9 o'clock in

23

the evening, the police had probable cause to believe

24

the drugs were there.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

An informant just came out

12

and said there were drugs there and they don't have

2

probable cause?

4

MR. STIRBA:

At the time of 9 o'clock, I

don't think it was established that there were drugs -

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why not?
I thought it was

7

established not only that there were drugs, but that he

8

actually tasted some.

MR. STIRBA:

He never told the police that.

And the purpose -

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. STIRBA:

But -

The purpose of the operation,

13

of course, was to establish that there was in fact drugs

14

in the house.

15

would conclusively establish probable cause.

16

think we should fault the police for essentially being

17

careful before they entered the home to make sure that

18

in fact they had probable cause.

19

The transaction would occur and that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't

The reason the police are

20

being faulted is that they didn't get a warrant.

21

the warrant requirement is a generally good starting

22

place for a Fourth Amendment argument.

23

And

Justice Ginsburg's point is that if they had

24

an informant who had seen drugs in the place within two

25

hours, they had, if they'd been before a magistrate, the
13

-- an anticipatory warrant.
I will admit that is the

15

most astonishing view of probable cause I have heard in

Of course they had.

MR. STIRBA:

MR. STIRBA:

21
22

Why doesn't it?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why doesn't it?

23

understand, the record evidence is that their informant

24

25

point that we went through, the second entry, he had

Alderson Reporting Company

3

Why wasn't there probable cause within that

MR. STIRBA:

Because the police did not

You're

22

asking us to extend the police officer rule to include a

confidential informant rule.

is, or would be, that in practical terms there is a need

25

for it.

One reason for doing so

Justice Ginsburg's question was, why is there a

Alderson Reporting Company

need for it, when they could have gotten a warrant?

2

we still haven't heard an answer.

3

MR. STIRBA:

And

In rural Utah -- and this is

that one of the reasons why they need to use

confidential informants is because the police are all

known.

Justice Souter.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. STIRBA:

That doesn't -

They -- they chose not to, for

16

reasons they didn't believe they had probable cause and

they were concerned that the drugs had been dissipated.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, in every -

19

given the posture of the ultimate issue in this case on

20

the underlying constitutional question, you do not have

21

to prove that you are right; isn't that correct?

22

have to establish that the contrary principle is not

23

clearly established?

24
25

MR. STIRBA:

That's correct.

You

And the law at

the time that these officers engaged in this operation,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

entered the home -- and once again, it was based upon

2

probable cause -- supported in fact constitutionally

3

what they did, and that it was indeed permissible.

4

that was the basis upon which we believe, irrespective

5

of how the Court views whether they should or should not

6

have gotten a warrant and the constitutional

7

implications of that, that the law was clearly not

8

established sufficiently such that these officers were

9

entitled to qualified immunity.

10

That was one of the

problems with the Tenth Circuit case.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
Tell me if I am wrong.

And

They -

May I just establish one

12

thing?

That this argument about

circumstances, and then on appeal the inevitable

16

this was not given as the reason, the consent once

justification for this search?

That is, in the trial court you argued exigent

20

So there was -- in the courts below,

MR. STIRBA:

That's true.

On the criminal

21

appeal, the State did not argue Lewis, did not argue

22

consent once removed.

23

with a number of cases that have been cited by the

24

Respondent.

And that is part of the problem

They are exigent circumstances cases where

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Stewart, could I follow

13

up on one other thing that came up during the preceding

14

argument?

15

probable cause quite separate from the consent once

16

removed doctrine?

17

probable cause here, there may be many instances in

18

which the consent once removed doctrine would be

19

applied, if it's a valid doctrine, where there wasn't

20

previously probable cause.

21

Isn't the issue whether there was or was not

What -- assuming that there was

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

I think the

22

consent once removed doctrine would have its greatest

23

utility in cases where the police suspect but don't have

24

probable cause to believe that a particular individual

25

is engaged in criminal activity, and so they send an
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

informant or an undercover police officer in to try to

2

either confirm or dispel their suspicions.

3

wouldn't be able to get a warrant at the outset because

4

they would not have probable cause at that time of

5

ongoing criminal conduct.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They

But if our question is

7

should consent once removed be recognized as a doctrine

8

that covers the confidential informant in this case, one

9

question that we may sensibly ask is, is there a need to

10

recognize that broad a consent doctrine?

11

question that would bear on that would be, in these

12

cases, is there difficulty or impossibility of getting a

13

warrant under normal probable cause standards?

14

think that was the point of Justice Ginsburg's question.

15

Do you doubt that they could have gotten a warrant

16

within the two-hour period?

17

MR. STEWART:

And one

And I

We certainly think that they

18

had probable cause.

There was testimony from police

19

officers to the effect that magistrates in Utah would be

20

reluctant to grant warrants based on these circumstances

21

because of the possibility that the drugs would be

22

dissipated.

23

their empirical experience as to the circumstances under

24

which Utah magistrates will and will not grant warrants.

25

But we think as a legal matter that there was probable

I am not in a position to second-guess

20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

cause, and that a warrant should have been issued.

2

certainly there are -- there are plenty of

3

circumstances -

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

That's -- it's not just

5

this case.

Maybe you can tell me.

I thought because

6

they were dealing with a confidential informant rather

7

than a police officer, they sent him in to do the dry

8

run.

9

the -- the undercover police officer goes in.

I mean the -- in the police officer cases usually
The other

10

police officers are there ready to come in when he gives

11

them the signal.

12

ordinarily go through this dry run that they had here

13

with the confidential informer.

14

But the police officers don't

MR. STEWART:

Well, I -- I would think that

15

with either police officers or with informants you could

16

have some situations in which the undercover operative

17

has very recently attempted to confirm the presence of

18

drugs.

19

undercover operative, again either an informant or a

20

police officer, could hear rumors on the street that a

21

particular individual was engaged in drug-dealing, might

22

not have probable cause, and they might decide that the

23

best way to set up the operation was to send this person

24

in to attempt to make a buy at a time when probable

25

cause was lacking.

And you can have other cases in which the

But they would want to arrange the
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

operation in such a way that if the operative's

2

experience confirmed their suspicions and gave them

3

probable cause to arrest, they would be able to go in

4

immediately.

5

And our principal contention is not that the

6

consent to the entry of Bartholomew was implicit consent

7

to the later entry of the police officers.

8

once a person has, even unknowingly, admitted a

9

government agent into his home, his expectation of

It was that

10

privacy is sharply reduced and the entry of the officers

11

works an insubstantial incremental invasion of privacy.

12

And I would like to return to the point that

13

Mr. Stirba was making.

14

here lacked the training and skills that -- and

15

integrity, for that matter, that you would expect a

16

police officer to have.

constitutional question first or the immunity question

24

first?

25

Do you think that we should answer the

MR. STEWART:

We think that this Court in
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this case should address the constitutional question

2

first because it is the subject of the square circuit

3

conflict, it's been briefed and argued, it's a question

4

that independently warrants resolution.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is quite difficult.

I

6

mean there -- we don't know quite a lot about whether

7

they would have gotten a warrant, how -- how dangerous

8

it was, whether the drugs were likely to be hidden.

9

I was thinking of it, and that's why I am saying this,

And

10

is that it's a perfect reason since constitutional

11

questions in this area are -- are like the stars in the

12

sky.

13

answer each one and getting everything mixed up, why not

14

just have them take whatever is the easier path?

18

with the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the

19

rest of it.

20

MR. STEWART:

I guess the first thing I

21

would say in response to that is we think that the -

22

the balance or the way in which discretion will

23

ordinarily be exercised will typically be different in

24

the case of the lower courts than in the case of this

25

Court, because the principal role of the lower Federal
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

courts is to decide individual cases before them usually

2

in the most expeditious and noncontroversial way where

3

they -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see that, but unless we

5

do that here, they are never going to get the right

6

message.

7

trying in an average in a year 50 or 60 cases each with

8

multiple facts, and we will have approximately over a

9

10-year period hundreds of thousands.

And so what we will have is 1,000 judges

I've exaggerated,

10

but there will be many, many -- many, many conflicts,

11

many, many confusions.

12

not doing it ourselves, how will they ever get the

13

message?

MR. STEWART:

And unless we say, no, we are

it, but I mean once.
MR. STEWART:

I think they will get the

19

message if the Court tells them that the mandatory rule

20

of Saucier is no longer in effect, that courts have

21

discretion to decide based on their sound judgment

22

whether it is -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why isn't it -- why

24

isn't it an advisory opinion, if we do not have to

25

decide -- to decide the ultimate question whether this
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is constitutional or not, but simply whether or not it

2

was clearly established whether it was unconstitutional?

3

Why isn't it purely an advisory opinion to say whether

4

it's constitutional or not?

5

MR. STEWART:

I mean, in one sense it's an

6

advisory opinion, but in another sense there are -

7

there are often cases in which two alternative grounds

8

for a decision are proffered, either one of which, if

9

accepted, would compel a judgment in one litigant's

10

favor.

And the fact that it would theoretically -- if

the court concludes there is only -

Are the police

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. STEWART:

No.

We think he could

2

automatically ask for the police to come into the home

3

because the incremental intrusion on privacy by having

4

several police officers rather than one to make the

5

arrest would be insubstantial.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't the reason it's

7

insubstantial is that we have a rule for independent

8

reasons having nothing necessarily to do with this kind

9

of situation in which one officer's knowledge is

regarded as another officer's knowledge.

We don't, however, have any such rule with

MR. STEWART:

I think you don't have that

17

precise rule, but it is nevertheless the case that the

18

undercover operative here, the informant, was a State

19

actor.

20

without consent, his conduct would have constituted a

21

Fourth Amendment violation because he would have been

22

regarded for that purpose as -- as an agent of the

23

State, and he should, therefore, be regarded as a State

24

agent for these purposes.

Had he been instructed to look in private places

without exigent circumstances?

This Court has long held that it is

If an undercover police officer is in a

Of course, the safest thing

19

for him would be to simply withdraw, get on the

telephone, and get a warrant to come back in, or during

the two hours that they were planning this entry he

22

could have gotten a warrant then or an anticipatory

warrant.

There are plenty of stated options.

way to get in without a warrant, then it would not be

permissible.

20

It wasn't certain, and they are in there and they see a

21

lot of drug behavior going on, and the drugs are going

22

to be hidden, go, disappear the second he leaves; and if

23

he tries to arrest them, everybody is going to jump on

him and kill him.

We can imagine a spectrum of

to think that because there was an informant inside and

constitutional question first.

3

I -- I'm just wondering what benefit there

4

is in an absolute rigid rule that courts of appeals -- I

5

had a few of these cases in courts of appeals; I thought

6

it was very odd that I had to go and decide a difficult

7

constitutional issue and then not worry about it because

8

in one sentence you say well, but the issue is not

9

clearly established and so it's qualified immunity.

10

MR. METZLER:

Well, that would take us to

11

back before Saucier, the Court -- it's a recent decision

12

that hasn't been proven to be workable.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in fact -

Well, but my point

14

though is that at least in my experience it was

15

unworkable, or at least frustrating, in that we had to

16

decide not just a factual question but a constitutional

17

question in a context where it wasn't necessary.

18

MR. METZLER:

Well, it depends on your view

19

of necessity.

20

come up in other contexts and the law is not established

21

in section 1983; it may never be established.

22

we are talking about a question where there is a circuit

23

split and the Court definitely should provide guidance

24

to the lower courts.

25

In some cases certainly, it won't really

But here

I don't think that -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Doesn't the fact

Official - Subject to Final Review

that there is a circuit split almost by definition mean

2

that it's not clearly established?

3

MR. METZLER:

Well, this Court has looked to

4

controlling -- its own precedents and controlling

5

circuit law to decide what is -- what law is clearly

6

established, and here, Payton and Steagald the courts

7

held that there is a bright-line rule that's very simple

8

for police officers, it's easy for them to understand.

If they would like to enter without a

there is consent to the police officer.

There are no exigent circumstances in this

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if -- what if the

States Court of Appeals, and they think this is

consistent with the Fourth Amendment?

Is it unreasonable for them

to follow that?

MR. METZLER:

Well, I think the officers in

the Tenth Circuit need to be aware the way that our

Federal court system works, and the Seventh Circuit

11

decision isn't binding on the Tenth Circuit.

12

all due respect to Judge Posner, he dropped ball on this

13

one.

14

the United States v Paul -- there are no exigent

15

circumstances; the officers there could have gotten a

16

warrant and in fact should have gotten a warrant but he

said it was justified by consent.

Tenth Circuit?

2

MR. METZLER:

Yes.

I think certainly an

3

officer in the Tenth Circuit would be bound to follow

4

the Tenth Circuit rule.

5

that other -- that other courts have decided it

6

differently, but to the extent that there is controlling

7

law in the circuit, I think that -

Then it is irrelevant that ten other

circuits have decided it differently.

wind up in this Court if CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, right, but do

14

the police officers get to decide that?

15

decide that not only Judge Posner thinks this, but ten

other circuits think this, and it has been five years

since the Tenth Circuit.

Well, we don't expect officers

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So at the time every

circuit other than the -- you know, if there is a police

4

officer and a confidential informant, I think that could

5

be considered a police officer because he is going to

6

call the police in -- every court of appeals decision

7

8

11

MR. METZLER:

Actually we have cited three

circuits where these same facts happened.

In the Eighth

Circuit, the First Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in those

12

circuits, did the court focus on the distinction between

13

the police officer and the confidential informant?

14

MR. METZLER:

Well, no.

The court looked to

15

whether there were exigent circumstances or consent.

16

The courts followed this Court's decision in Payton and

17

Bramble and that line of cases.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you believe

19

that -- what is the appropriate level of generality to

20

look at in addressing this question, a case involving a

21

confidential informant?

22

MR. METZLER:

I think the appropriate level

23

of generality is that the facts under the court -- the

would we say that is presumptively unconstitutional?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You are talking about the

16

you want to interject the judicial between police and

17

the person in jeopardy.

18

unless -- and then you have exceptions, but I think your

point is that there is a main rule.

Alderson Reporting Company

a situation where the exigent circumstances are the

creation of the scenario that the police have set up,

the police cannot -- and you have a police officer who

is being the undercover operative who has the power to

make an arrest, that police officer cannot signal for

MR. METZLER:

Well, our position is that

would be -- the additional officer entry would violate

the Constitution -

MR. METZLER:

Well, I disagree that the

20

officer could be in danger -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

The hypothetical

22

is that they have to send people in to assist him.

23

the hypothetical also is they should have anticipated

this, and therefore, in your words, they created exigent

circumstances.

MR. METZLER:

And I find that a dangerous

I don't think you would need

22

to to write the opinion that would say that, because

23

exigent circumstances are not in this case.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Metzler, what do you

say to this line of reasoning, we have in prior cases
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

adopted the positions that for purposes of establishing

2

probable cause, the knowledge of one police officer is

3

also the knowledge of all police officers, at least

4

within a department or working on a particular problem.

5

So that if in a case in which there is a search without

6

a warrant, if you add up everything that individual

7

officers knew and that amounts to probable cause, then

8

the search is good.

9

Why don't we apply, in effect, the same rule

10

in the hypothetical case that you have been given, which

11

is a police officer who was admitted by consent and

12

there are other police officers outside.

13

at which the police officer who has been admitted has

14

the knowledge necessary for an arrest and has that

15

knowledge as a result of the invitation and the waiver

16

of privacy as to him, why don't we regard that on sort

17

of general doctrinal grounds as a waiver of privacy with

18

respect to the police in general, just as we regard

19

police knowledge as being imputed to all police

20

officers?

21

At the point

That way you don't have the problem that,

22

for example, Justice Kennedy's hypo raises, even in the

case of exigent circumstances.

door to what you were objecting to here.

But it doesn't open the

Why isn't that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. METZLER:

Well, if you are to adopt that

2

sort of -- I think you certainly could adopt that

3

rationale.

4

through a waiver, because real there's nothing that the

5

person -- the suspect has done that he knows about that

6

would mean that he waived the expectation that

7

additional people would come in.

8

But I don't think the way to get there is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There might be -

No, you are absolutely

right in terms of his psychological process, the only

10

person he has invited in is the one person.

11

for coming up with the answer I suggested is a broader

12

doctrinal reason.

13

probable cause purposes regarded the police -- or the

14

knowledge of one police officer as the knowledge for

15

all.

16

The reason

That is the reason that we have for

Why don't we, for the same reasons, since it

17

is privacy that is at stake in all of these cases,

18

regard the invitation of one police officer as the

19

invitation of all, or to all?

20

MR. METZLER:

Again, I don't think that the

21

way to get there is through consent.

22

balance and say, well, the government has an agent in

23

there who is making the arrest and there is safety

24

concerns and other reasons why we would want to do that,

25

that might be one way to get there.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

If you want it to

I don't think it's

Official - Subject to Final Review

through consent.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It would be consent to one

officer plus a doctrinal basis to construe that consent

4

for Fourth Amendment purposes as a broader consent.

5

MR. METZLER:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's what we would be

doing.

We wouldn't be doing it because the individual

in the trailer says I am inviting in the whole L.A.

We are doing it because he invites

I'm

saying that for probable cause purposes we regard the

6

Here the confidential informant, all he is

telling the officers outside what is happening inside.

9

And he gives them probable cause.

doesn't make him an agent of the police?

He

agent for purposes of making an arrest inside, which is

what they want to do.

MR. METZLER:

If there was some assist to

21

making an arrest -- of the government, then assuming we

22

are following Justice Souter's few exceptions, then I

23

think that they would fall into that exception.

here, of course, the confidential informant is no such

thing.

But

This confidential informant was not active

11

12

would give police the right to cross that threshold.

13

this confidential informant were a police officer, I

14

think you would have to base it on the power of the

15

police to make the arrest inside, the power of the State

16

to make that -

17

And nothing that the -- that the confidential

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even if there is such a

18

thing as citizen's arrest, I think it was part of this

19

record that -- that they do not want confidential

20

informers to go making arrests, so that the police

21

distinguish the confidential informer.

22

MR. METZLER:

That's correct,

23

Justice Ginsburg.

Both the Solicitor General and the

24

Petitioners agree that confidential informants should

25

not and would not be making these arrests.
51
Alderson Reporting Company

So the

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

function of the confidential informant is really as I

2

said, just a surveillance device; and what is important

3

is not what he is doing but what the police are doing

4

who are outside.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But going back to why

6

should we decide this question, particularly in Fourth

7

Amendment cases when these issues will come up on

8

suppression motions, so there isn't a need to decide

9

them in the -- in the civil context.

10

MR. METZLER:

But I think in general we are

11

talking about a very small category of cases like this

12

one where their -- the criminal defendant won on the

13

Fourth Amendment and then the police bring up some new

14

argument on a qualified immunity defense because there

15

would already be some law on the questions that were

16

decided in the -- in the criminal case.

17

So in those limited circumstances it seems

18

to put too much of a thumb on the scale on the side of

19

police that says well, you can come up with a new theory

20

and you don't even have to show that it applies; all you

21

have to show is that nobody has ever rejected your

22

theory and then it is not fairly established.

23

think in that small number of cases that the balance

24

should really tilt that far towards police.

25

here it's certainly not, where the Solicitor General and
52
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't

And here,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Petitioners both agree that the Court should decide

2

both questions.

3

The constitutional question here is not very

4

difficult.

It boils down to, in the absence of exigent

5

circumstances, could any reasonable officer have

6

believed that the two circumstances they would like to

7

see in previous cases -- that is, that a confidential

8

informant is inside, and that he sends a signal out that

9

there is probable cause -- do those make any difference

10

whatsoever to the calculation of whether there are

11

exigent circumstances or consent?

12

no reasonable officer could have believed otherwise.

there are no further questions.

The colloquy about the safety

between a confidential informant and the officer really

23

doesn't make much meaningful headway in terms of the

24

Fourth Amendment.

going to do that, either, for the same particular

10

problem, even if the confidential informant had arrested

11

powers under State law.

12

can call up for backup and assistance to effectuate

13

arrest, which is specifically what occurred here.

14

Similarly, there is no really distinction to be drawn

15

between a confidential informant as a government actor

16

allowing for the additional entry or follow-up entry of

17

additional officers for backup and assistance to make

18

sure the arrest is safe and secure than if you have a

police officer.

20

The issue is the police officer

The second point I would like to make is the

21

first time any Federal circuit drew this distinction

22

between a confidential informant and a police officer

23

was the Tenth Circuit decision.

24

once removed.

25

Obviously the police officers involved in this case

They adopted consent

They just limited it to a police officer.

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could not reasonably be expected to anticipate such a

2

distinction being drawn, especially given the fact that

3

there was at least a Seventh Circuit body of law, the

4

Sixth Circuit body of law, and as we argue, which we

5

think is a fair reading of Gramble -- because they cite

6

the Seventh Circuit body of law that includes the

7

confidential informant -- there were at least three

8

circuits that rejected that distinction, and you in 2000

9

confirmed that in the Sixth Circuit there is no

10

distinction as a matter of this particular doctrine

11

between a confidential informant and a police officer.

12

And finally with respect to the exigent

13

circumstances cases, and you can look at any one that

14

was cited by the Respondent, there is no mention of

15

Lewis, there is no mention of consent once removed,

16

there is no mention of any abrogation of privacy.

17

issues were not raised, just like the issues were not

18

raised in the criminal appeal of Mr. Callahan's

19

conviction; and so therefore they are really not

20

relevant, they are not probative, and we are not

21

suggesting this is an exigent circumstances case, nor

22

are we suggest relying on for purposes of the Fourth

23

Amendment issue any implied consent.

25

Those

We have rested our -- the justification for
the Fourth Amendment issue on search incident and also
