ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

The first sentence of Section 7703(b)(2)

11

provides that district courts have jurisdiction over all

12

mixed cases, and that provision is largely dispositive

13

here.

14

The second sentence of 7703(b)(2) on which

15

the Government relies is a statute of limitations, and

16

it doesn't limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts.

17

That subsection is set out at pages 16a to

18

17a of the Government's brief.

19

provides that for a described category of cases, they

20

are to be, quote, "filed under one of the listed Federal

21

antidiscrimination statutes."

22

The first sentence

As this Court pointed out in Elgin, all of

23

those are statutes which authorize jurisdiction

24

and claims in district courts.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Schnapper, could you

3

clarify what the district court, as you see it, does?

4

Does it deal only with the discrimination claim, or does

5

it deal with the MSPB's procedural ruling?

6

MR. SCHNAPPER:

With regard to the -- when

7

the case gets to district court, there may be two

8

substantive claims, a discrimination claim and a CSRA

9

claim.

10

Your question, I take it, is about the former.
Our view is that the claim is filed and

11

pled, as indeed it was pled in this case, as a

12

discrimination case; in this case, under several

13

different statutes.

14

much like an ordinary discrimination complaint.

And the complaint here reads very

15

The Government may raise the -- that sort of

16

procedural issue as an affirmative defense, and it would

number of occasions.

And that -- that happens on a

19

For example, if there were a case in which

20

the Plaintiff had not, as required by the regulations,

21

appealed to the MSPB within 30 days of the -- of receipt

22

of the agency decision, the Government could move to

23

dismiss that claim on what the lower courts call

24

exhaustion grounds.

25

repeatedly sustained those motions -

And the lower courts have

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Schnapper --

determinative defense.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the critical

5

point, I gather, is what standard of review the district

6

court will apply to that exhaustion question, or the

7

bar question, right?

8
9

I assume you think that the standard review
in the district court is going to be more favorable to

10

your client than the standard -- the arbitrary and

11

capricious standard that would be applicable in the

12

Federal circuit?

13

I guess --

14

MR. SCHNAPPER:

When it's come up,

15

Your Honor, it has generally been a question of law,

16

like whether the 30-day rule had applied.

17

something that was -- if it were a factual issue, our

18

contention is then those Section 7703(c) factual issues

19

have to be decided de novo.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you had

Why don't we take this --

21

this very case, where the MSPB said that -- that the

22

claim was time barred, so the Government would raise it

23

as an affirmative defense.

24

MR. SCHNAPPER:

25

And the first question would

be whether it's an affirmative defense at all, and our
5

Alderson Reporting Company

position would be that it is not.

2

could go awry in the internal procedure is an

3

affirmative defense.

4

Not everything that

One of the central principles of the

5

1972 amendments to Title VII was to create an exhaustion

6

regime which is precise, simple and short.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And if --

Counselor, can I back

8

you up a minute to join the two questions that my

9

colleague posed to you?

10

Let's assume there's a merits-based decision

11

on the CSRA and one on the discrimination.

12

normal course, assuming you are not barred by being

13

untimely, you could go to the district court, and the

14

district court presumably would have jurisdiction, if

15

one is a discrimination-based decision, to decide both

16

questions.

18

whether the factual issue regarding the timeliness and

And the -- Congress made a decision to

As this Court noted in Chandler and in Brown

11

v. GSA, Congress concluded, I think correctly, and the

12

Court's opinion suggests that, that the steps necessary

13

to exhaust were not clear.

14

So the regime established by Section 717 of

That is the fundamental principle that's

Indeed, to the contrary, the CSRA has -- it

it.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

11

No, Your Honor.

The

12

affirmative defenses could still be raised.

It's just

13

that the CSRA claim under Section 7703(c) would -- would

14

be abandoned.

And that's --

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what provision --

16

MR. SCHNAPPER:

-- that's what happened

17

here.

It's not uncommon.
The CSRA claim involves a right that is much

18
19

more valuable to the plaintiff in the administrative

20

process.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

What provision authorizes

22

the filing of anything other than a discrimination claim

23

in district court?

24
25

I don't see it.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

The statute says "Cases of

discrimination subject to" -

And 7702 --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

It says, "shall be

filed under Title VII."
So you are saying that a nondiscrimination
claim can be filed under Title VII?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

No.

The way the courts have

read this, and I think correctly, is this:

If -- so

10

this is just one case.

12

asserting a discrimination claim, the CSRA claim comes

13

along with it.

14

It's a little bit like
So long as the plaintiff is

If the plaintiff were to abandon the

15

discrimination claim, then the case would have to go to

16

17

interpreted that.

18

That's the way the courts have

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I understand that a

19

lot of courts have read it that way.

20

difficult to see how it fits in the statutory language.

21

And in particular, since the second sentence of

22

subsection (2) there has its own filing deadline, it

23

seems strange to have a district court review the

24

timeliness of the filing before the MSPB.

25

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I find it

Well, the second point you

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

make is really separate from the first, because even if

2

only a discrimination claim is filed, the Government can

3

insert an affirmative defense, and one possible

4

affirmative defense which the Government has repeatedly

5

asserted successfully is that the appeal to the MSPB was

6

untimely.

So that happens either way.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

your CSRA claim, they can assert that defense?

9

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes.

Even if you give up

Yes.

It's because --

10

because the discrimination statutes themselves have two

11

requirements.

12

13

You have to wait a certain amount of time if you don't

14

have a decision.

You have to have filed the complaint or

15

The statutes themselves don't --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't understand why

17

you're giving this up, and I don't see -- I also don't

18

see any provision that says that -- that specifies what

19

the standard of review in the district court is for a

20

nondiscrimination claim.

21

(C) sets out the standard of review in the

22

Federal Circuit for a nondiscrimination claim, but it

23

pointedly says nothing about the district court.

24

Doesn't that suggest that that claim doesn't go to the

25

district court?
12

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Wouldn't you have a right to go

statutes authorize that.

25

to find a repealer contained somewhere -

In that --- in the Civil Service

MR. SCHNAPPER:

And

5

we think this is a classic example of -- for application

6

of the rule that implied repeals are disfavored.

-- this statute is quite precise when -- when it's

changing something, it's very specific.

4

contain a time period within which a charge or a

5

complaint must be filed with the agency, and they don't

contain a time period within which an appeal must be

7

taken.

Those time periods are in the regulations.

The lower courts have taken the position
that those time periods also have to be complied with,

6

MR. SCHNAPPER:

The CSRA claim is much more

7

valuable at the MSPB.

In terms of discrimination claim,

8

in the real world that's probably not why people go to

9

the MSPB.

The MSPB, according to the only study I've

10

been able to find, out of 2,000 mixed cases the MSPB

11

actually only found discrimination in four.

12

higher percentage of CSRA claims are successful there.

13

So that's why people go there.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But a much

So I suppose if you

15

say, I was fired on the basis of race, and the agency

says, no, you were fired because you were incompetent,

17

you could take the incompetence claim to the MSPB, and

18

if you win, saying, no, you were perfectly competent,

19

they shouldn't have fired you, you get that relief and

20

you don't need to proceed with the discrimination --

The point is that

So if --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Schnapper, if I disagree

with everything that you just said, I can still rule for

you in this case, right?

20
21
22

MR. SCHNAPPER:

You can, and you don't need

to address what I just said.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because there does seem to

23

be a good deal of difference between the question, what

24

happens to something that is clearly a mixed case, and

25

alternatively, the question of whether something is a
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mixed case; that is, whether it includes a claim about

2

an action which the employee may appeal to the MSPB.

3

And one could think that questions about what can be

4

appealed to the MSPB ought to go to the Federal circuit

5

under this statutory language in a way that questions

6

that are involved in this case do not.

7

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Your Honor, you don't need

8

to rule for that -- me on that, but if I could identify

9

another problem before my time runs out.

There is --

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Thank you, Counsel.

MS. HARRINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

9

I would like to start if I could with

10

Justice Scalia's -- I'm sorry.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you abandoning the

12

jurisdictional procedural distinction as you did in your

you or against you?

Are you telling us to rule either completely for

MS. HARRINGTON:

That's always been our

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

make the argument that there was no basis for the

7

distinction between procedural and jurisdictional.

8
9

MS. HARRINGTON:

I agree that there is no

basis for the distinction and part of that is because,

10

as my friend Mr. Schnapper pointed out, there is an EEOC

11

regulation providing that when the board dismisses a

12

case on jurisdictional grounds the case can go back to

13

the agency, the agency can essentially reissue its final

decision, and then the plaintiff goes in to district

So the action

And if -- I would like to start with

21

Justice Scalia's line of questions about whether there

22

has been a repeal of the right to go to district court

23

on discrimination claims.

24

point is in the Federal Courts Improvement Act which is

25

28 USC 1295(a)(9), which provides that review of MSPB

And I think our starting

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decisions is exclusively in the Federal circuit.

This

2

court is recently -- most recently in Elgin, but in

3

various cases over of the last 25 years has seen that

4

that is an exclusive grant of judicial review of

5

jurisdiction in the Federal circuit over MSPB final

6

decisions, and as the Court pointed out in Elgin the

7

only exception to that is for the subset of final board

8

decisions that are covered in 7703(b)(2).

9

look at 7703(b)(2) the only reference to a final board

And if you

10

decision is at the top of page 17(a) of the Government's

11

brief is to judicially reviewable actions under section

12

7702.

13

judicially reviewable action and the reason we do that

14

is because throughout the entire U.S. Code that phrase

15

is only ever used either in or in reference to section

16

7702.

17

Now we put a lot of emphasis on the phrase

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, does that mean

18

that it is not a judicially reviewable action if it is

19

thrown out on a procedural ground.

20
21
22

MS. HARRINGTON:

It means that it's not a

judicially reviewable action under 7702.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why is that?

I

23

mean, we think of a -- we review cases on procedural

24

objections all the time and we think of those as

25

judicially reviewable.

It's -- it's a real stretch to
27


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say simply because it says "judicially reviewable" it

2

means judicially reviewable on the merits.

3

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, in our view, again,

4

because it uses the phrase "judicially reviewable

5

action" under 7702 and that phrase "judicially

6

reviewable action" in the whole U.S. Code is only ever

7

used when you are talking about 7702, that -- in our

8

view that's the signal that that's a term of art in this

9

context.

10

So although dismissal on procedural grounds

11

is a board action subject to judicial review, in our

12

view it's not a judicially reviewable action under 7702.

13

And so you need to look at 7702 to see how --

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
again?

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18
19

Could you say that

Yes.

slowly.
MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

A procedural

20

dismissal by the board is a final board action that's

21

subject to judicial review in the Federal Circuit.

22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

MS. HARRINGTON:

MS. HARRINGTON:

But it does not fall within

2

the term of art "judicially reviewable action" under

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I thought

5

that your argument in the brief reduced to the question

that an action subject to judicial review in one section

7

is not judicially reviewable in another.

It's a tough

1

MS. HARRINGTON:

-- review.

2

It's a tough statute.

In our view, our

3

argument is the best reading of the overall statute.

4

And again, because we think "judicially reviewable

5

action" under 7702 is sort of the linchpin phrase in

6

7703(b)(2), we want to look to 7702 to how the phrase

7

"judicially reviewable action" is used by Congress in

8

that statute, and the relevant pages here are page 8a

9

and 9a in the statutory appendix to the Government's

10

brief.

11
12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I ask you a couple

questions?

13

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When the Federal Circuit

15

was created, this language preexisted its creation,

16

correct?

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So could you tell me how

19

when Congress was writing 7702 it was creating the

20

system that you are advocating when it had no idea that

21

it would ever create the Federal Circuit?

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I have two answers.

23

The first is that in the last 25 years in all the cases

24

where this Court has looked as section 7703, in Lindahl

25

and Fausto and most recently in Elgin, the Court has
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpreted the statute as it exists today, which as it

2

exists today directs review of board decisions to the

3

Federal Circuit.

4

But the second answer is, even for that

5

brief window after the CSRA was enacted before the

6

Federal Circuit was created, Congress still had taken

7

away jurisdiction from district courts over board

8

decisions and had directed them to the courts of

9

appeals.

And this Court recognized in Fausto that that

10

-- Congress specifically had that intent when it enacted

11

the CSRA.

12

in all the district courts throughout the country over

13

Federal employment actions and it wanted to reduce a

14

layer of review and direct them to fewer courts.

15

It was tired of this concurrent jurisdiction

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now --

That still doesn't

16

answer my question, which is:

17

Federal Circuit, I have to read the language that exists

18

in 7702 and 7703, and I see judicial review, appealable

19

judicial review, used not in the manner that you're

20

describing.

21

MS. HARRINGTON:

Assuming there is no

I disagree, Your Honor.

I

22

mean -- and there is nothing in 7702 or 7703 that would

23

indicate that Congress wanted, even in 1978 to have MSPB

24

final decisions reviewed in district court.

25

we don't need to assume that the Federal Circuit doesn't
31

Alderson Reporting Company

And again,

Official

1

exist today because it does, and that's how this Court

2

has construed the statute for the last 25 years, ever

3

since the --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Ms. Harrington, go back

5

to the question that the Chief Justice asked you,

6

because the question was:

7

reviewable action" as something different from action

8

subject to judicial review, which is how you would

9

normally read that language, as something different from

Should we read "judicially

10

just final agency action that you can take to a court.

11

Not saying which court, that you can just take to a

12

court.

13

And you're asking us -- you said it's a term

14

of art.

15

get the definition of the term of art that you say

16

exists in this statute?

17

So I guess the next question is:

MS. HARRINGTON:

How do you

Well, you look at 7702, and

18

let me just say, even if you disagree with us that it's

19

a term of art, it's hard to disagree with the fact that

20

it has to be a judicially reviewable action under 7702.

21

That's in the text of 7703(b)(2).

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, it has to be an action

23

that -- you know, the MSPB is done and now you have a

24

certain number of days to take it to a court.

25

the normal way you would read that language.
32

Alderson Reporting Company

So that's

Official

1

MS. HARRINGTON:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -But you say no, it really,

3

you know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not

4

other kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that

5

it's really a switch as to which court you get to take

6

the action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to

7

read this language.

8
9

So I guess I'm asking you:
find the definition of the term of art?

Where do you
And I think

10

what your answer is going to be is this notion the board

11

shall decide the issue of discrimination and the

12

applicable action; is that correct.

13

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

Can I just take you

14

back one sentence to say, the point is not just that

15

the board is done, the point is that the board is done

16

under 7702; that it has issued a decision under 7702,

17

and so then, as you suggest, we look at 7702 and in that

18

provision Congress specifies various points at which a

19

final board decision under 7702 becomes a judicially

20

reviewable action.

21

The one that's relevant in this case is in

22

subsection (a)(3), which is on page 9a in the middle of

23

the page there.

24

under paragraph (1)" -- so that's 7702(a)(1) -- "of this

25

subsection shall be a judicially reviewable action,

It says:

"Any decision of the board

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

either when it's issued if the employee doesn't seek

2

EEOC review or when the EEOC declines to hear the case."

3

So in our view there are two indications in

4

(a)(3) that tell you that it has to be a decision on the

5

issue of discrimination in order to be a judicially

6

reviewable action -- action under section 7702.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why doesn't the language

8

that Justice Kagan referred to, the requirement that the

9

board within 120 days decide both the issue of

10

discrimination and the appealable action, mean that the

11

board has to dispose of both the issue of discrimination

12

and the appealable action, not that it must actually

13

adjudicate those two issues?

14

What if you have a threshold, you have a

15

threshold timeliness issue that is completely

16

dispositive?

17

board nevertheless has to decide the merits of the

18

discrimination issue?

19

You're saying that this language means the

MS. HARRINGTON:

No.

I'm glad you asked

20

that question.

21

referring to is at the bottom of page 8a.

22

is that the board shall decide both the issue of

23

discrimination and the appealable action in accordance

24

with the board's appellate procedures.

25

The directive in section -- that you're
The directive

In this case the board complied with that
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

directive by not deciding the issue of discrimination

2

because the appeal was untimely.

3

a little strange when I first say it, so let me give you

4

an analogous example.

5

the DMV to issue a driver's license to any applicant in

6

accordance -- in accordance with the procedures

7

governing such applications.

8

driver's license applicants either pay a fee or submit

9

to an eye exam, you wouldn't expect that they would have

10

to issue a license to someone who refused to comply with

11

those requirements.

12

with the directive that it issue a license in accordance

13

with its procedures by not issuing a license at all.

14

And I know that sounds

Imagine a State law that directed

If the DMV required that

In that case the DMV would comply

And it's the same thing here.

Here the

15

board complied with the directive that it decide the

16

issue of discrimination in accordance with its appellate

17

procedures by not deciding the issue of discrimination

18

and therefore not issuing a decision under 7703.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't have to read it

20

that way, do you?

I mean, look, it says in (a), it

21

says, let's take an employee who is affected adversely,

22

and then it says "alleges that the basis for the action

23

was discrimination," okay.

24

within 120 days decide both the issue of discrimination

25

and the appealable action.

In that case the board shall

So they decided it.

35

Alderson Reporting Company

They

1

decided it was out of time.

2

They decided da, da, da.

3

They decided it was barred.

I mean, there are a lot of decisions on an

4

issue that a person raises in court and we don't

5

normally say they didn't decide the issue, the court.

6

It decided it.

7

It decided it was untimely.

MS. HARRINGTON:

But I think normally when a

8

court dismisses a case based on timeliness you don't

think of it as deciding the issue.

Oh, well, I see.

The

that particular one, and now we go to the district

13

court.

There it is right in paragraph 1(b) of

The MSPB says, you lose for any reason on

That's just so simple.
MS. HARRINGTON:

That would certainly be

15

simpler.

16

maybe that's what we would decide.

17

And if it were up to us to make up the rules,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, no, no.

All we're

18

doing is interpreting what you've said is the word

19

issue, not to be quite so technical as to mean decide on

20

the merits, which it doesn't mean normally, but we're

21

interpreting it to mean decide the allegation that he

22

has raised that he was discriminated against.

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

But what we're trying to do

24

is figure out how much of an exception Congress wanted

25

to create to the exclusive -- to the Federal circuit's
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

exclusive jurisdiction to review MSPB decisions.
In our view, its choice of the word issue is

3

important, because it's not just deciding the case that

4

alleges discrimination.

discrimination.

It's the issue of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MS. HARRINGTON:

8

There's another hint in paragraph (a)(3),

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

Go ahead.

and let me know if you want to jump in, but not just the

10

direction to look at (a)(1), but paragraph (a)(3),

11

another hint that Congress was really talking about

12

cases where the board decides the issue of

13

discrimination.

14

In paragraph (a)(3), again, on (9)(a),

15

Congress provides that a judicially reviewable action

16

becomes -- becomes a judicially reviewable action when

17

the employee decides not to seek review from the EEOC or

18

when the EEOC decides not to take the case.

19

Now, the only types of decisions from the

20

board that the EEOC can review are decisions that reach

21

an issue of discrimination.

22

to be talking about decisions under (a)(1) that the EEOC

23

could review if you're talking about decisions that

24

don't involve the issue of discrimination.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so it would be strange

Ms. Harrington, may I

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just clarify that if -- if the case goes to the MSPB,

2

and the MS -- the Federal circuit, the Federal circuit

3

agrees with the MSPB that this was untimely filed,

4

that's the end of the case, the discrimination claim

5

would never be heard then.

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

I mean, the plaintiffs

7

could then file a suit in district court and seek

8

equitable tolling for having missed the deadline to file

9

from the date of the final agency decision.

10

And, in fact, that was one of the

11

alternative bases for jurisdiction that was asserted in

12

the district court below in this case.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if the Plaintiff then

14

goes to the district court, then what position does the

15

Government take?

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

It depends on the case.

In

17

this case, we argued against equitable tolling because,

18

in our view, she had missed the deadlines through her

19

own fault.

20

it wasn't really her fault for missing the deadlines for

21

appealing and -- so that even though her appeal to the

22

MSPB was, in fact, untimely, it wasn't really her fault,

23

then we might not resist equitable tolling.

24
25

But if there was some reason to think that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Schnapper told us in

his brief, and he repeated it this morning, that the
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MSPB and the EEOC disagree with your reading of the

2

statute, that they think that the so-called mixed case

3

goes to the district court.

4

MS. HARRINGTON:

I don't think that's

5

correct.

6

that, I don't think -- I mean, I know it's not correct

7

that the EEOC and MSPB disagree with --

8
9
10
11

I didn't hear him say that; but, if he said

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, didn't -- in the

Ballentine case, didn't the MSPB take the position that
it didn't go to the Federal circuit?
MS. HARRINGTON:

That was our position, you

12

know, I think it was 30 years ago now.

13

Ballentine decision, the Government has had the other --

14

has had the position that we're asserting today, which

15

is that the only --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And since the

And so you -- are you --

17

are you telling us that the position you're representing

18

on behalf of the Government is the position that the

19

MSPB would take today, is the position that the EEOC

20

would take today?

21

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

Yes.

Our brief is

22

filed on behalf of all the agencies in the United States

23

that are affected by this.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
back to judicially reviewable -
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Counsel, getting

Official

1

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Excellent.
-- even if I accept

3

your argument that that's not the same as subject to

4

judicial review, isn't it an odd backhanded way to get

5

to your position?

6

This is not something about -- a provision

7

about what's judicially reviewable and what's not.

It's

8

a notice provision.

9

filed within 30 days after notice of judicial review.

It says these actions have to be

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, but some --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And then you say

12

that judicial reviewability is the key linchpin that

13

bases your argument, when it's really just in a sentence

14

about notice.

15

MS. HARRINGTON:

But it's in a provision

16

that's describing the exception to the general rule

17

that's set out in 7703.

18

So the general rule in 7703 is that when

19

you're talking about final board decisions, judicial

20

review of those decisions is in the Federal circuit.

21

And this is at 16(a) and 17(a) in the Government's

22

brief.

23

It says, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2).
So when you're looking to (b)(2), you're

24

wondering -- you're asking what subset of final board

25

actions -- that's -- final order or decision -- that's
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

their language used in (a)(1) -- what subset of final

2

orders or decisions of the Merit Systems Protection

3

Board fall within (b)(2).
Now, in (b)(2), the only types of final

4
5

orders that are described there is at the end of the

6

section, judicially reviewable action under section

7

7702.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, yes, that's

where the phrase comes in, but it does seem an odd way

10

to establish that that is the critical element that

11

tells you which provisions you can take forward when it

12

just says your time is 30 days after you get notice of

13

judicial review.

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

Under --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And here the

16

Government says, aha, judicial review, we think that

17

does not mean subject to judicial review.

18

reviewable doesn't mean subject to judicial review.

19
20

MS. HARRINGTON:

Judicially

So even if you throw out

the term of art --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

-- part of our argument, and all

23

you look at is the last two words of that sentence,

24

which is Section 7702, you still have to look at 7702

25

and figure out when Congress told you that a final board

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision could be subject to judicial review.

2

And the relevant place for this case where

3

it did that is in section (a)(3), which is on page 9a.

4

And there again, it points at (a)(1), which directs that

5

the Board decide the issue of discrimination.

6

says a decision under (a)(1) is -- is judicially

7

reviewable.

8

discrimination, it is not --

9

If a decision does not reach the issue of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

shall be reviewable action as of.

11

going to the timeliness.

12

So it

MS. HARRINGTON:

As of.

See, it

Again, it's just

Right.

But again -- but

13

the two time triggers would only come into play if a

14

decision reached an issue of discrimination, because the

15

EEOC can't review issues -- can't review dismissals on

16

jurisdictional or procedural grounds.

17

the EEOC's review of the board's -- of a board decision

18

is limited to its review of the board's interpretation

19

of an anti-discrimination law or its application of

20

those laws to a particular case.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It can only --

Ms. Harrington, would you

22

agree that this is a remarkably strange way of Congress

23

trying to accomplish this objective?

24

Congress were really saying we don't want procedural

25

determinations to go to the district court, that's a
43

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, if

Official

1

very easy thing to say.

2

you -- you know, involve six different cross-references

3

and unnatural reading of statutory language.

4

Congress does not need to send

And, you know, in the end, your argument

5

just is based on this notion that Congress used the word

6

decide rather than dispose of in this single provision.

7

The argument would completely collapse if that were not

8

the case.

9

you say it wanted, Congress would not have done it in

10

It just seems like if Congress wanted what

this extremely complicated and backhanded way.

11

MS. HARRINGTON:

I mean, I'm not going to

12

resist the idea that the CSRA is very complicated.

13

mean, every case this Court has had about the CSRA, they

14

have remarked about how it is a complex statutory

15

scheme.

16

I

But I think Congress did accomplish in a

17

pretty simple way what you suggest, which is directing

18

that procedural rules should be reviewed in the Federal

19

circuit, and it did that by making that the background

20

rule.

21

In 7703(a) and (b)(1), it says, final

22

decisions of the board are reviewed in the Federal

23

circuit, full stop only, except as provided in (b)(2).

24

And then the question is, well, which of those decisions

25

fall within (b)(2).
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

In our view, you should not read that

1
2

exception more broadly than necessary to accommodate

3

employees' rights to have their discrimination claims

4

determined de novo in district court.
Here, the board decision, it decided two

5
6

things.

First, was Petitioner's appeal to the board

7

timely; and, second, was there good cause to excuse her

8

untimeliness.

9

would have wanted that Board decision to be reviewed

There is no reason to think that Congress

10

anywhere other than the Federal circuit.

11

point of having the Federal circuit is to have a unified

12

body of law governing certain things in the country that

13

Congress really thought should be directed to one place,

14

and that included board decisions.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The whole

But you're not -- the

16

Federal circuit didn't exist at the time that these

17

statutes were written, so what -- you know, really, it

18

would have been taken to the various courts of appeals,

19

and you wouldn't have gotten that uniformity anyway.

20

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right, but you would have

21

had more uniformity than you would have had if the cases

22

had continued to go to the district court, which is

23

what -- which is what was happening before the CSRA, and

24

Congress specifically wanted to stop that process.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't have a quarrel

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with your opposing counsel's position that once the

2

Board decides the CSRA claim and the discrimination

3

claim, the district court reviews both?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Yes.

questioning that, but you don't quarrel with that.

7

MS. HARRINGTON:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

We don't quarrel with it.
So the lack of

uniformity is inherent in this structure.

You just want

to carve out one piece of it that --

11

MS. HARRINGTON:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

Justice Alito was

No --- that you say deserves

more uniformity.

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

It is -- it is true that a

15

small range of procedural issues governing the board's

16

procedures might be heard in district court, but it is

17

truly a very small universe of issues bordering on

18

non-existent, and let me explain why.

19

here, the only reason -- the only way it would come up

20

is as part of an affirmative defense by the agency, a

21

defense of exhaustion.

22

would have to be a procedural issue that the Government,

23

that the agency raised before the board and the board

24

rejected.

25

As suggested

But then generally speaking it

Now, the board's own regulations allow the
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

board to waive any of its -- any of its regulatory

2

requirements, including timeliness, for good cause.

3

so the Government would have to argue in the district

4

court that essentially the board abused its discretion

5

by not waiving a procedural objection, and that's a very

6

high hurdle and I think it's really hard to imagine very

7

many cases in which that's going to come up, where the

8

Government's going to make that kind of argument.

9

although there's -- there's potential, there's a

And

So

10

potential for a tiny bit of erosion of uniformity under

11

our view, it is really a small universe of issues that

12

could go to district court.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there anything you want

14

to say on the question of which is worse?

15

say, I get your point on the word "issue," and I think

16

you can read the word "issue" to say there is a

17

contested point as to whether there was discrimination

18

or to say there is a contested point between the parties

19

as to whether the MSPB -- whether the plaintiff has a --

20

has a legal right before the MSPB to get the lower --

21

the agency reversed on the issue of discrimination.

22

The latter way favors your opponent, the

23

former favors you; okay.

24

guess.

25

That is to

So we could do either, I

courts deciding different procedural matters, where

5

you'd get more uniformity out of the Federal Circuit.

6

Okay.

That sounds confusing to me.

If you lose, I

Do you have anything to say about which of those
Is there any reason --

8

MS. HARRINGTON:

Absolutely.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have we any way of knowing?

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

I mean, I think Congress

11
12

made the determination.
JUSTICE BREYER:

-- going back to the

13

language, and so far, in my hypothetical anyway, I think

14

the language at best might be read, that word "issue,"

15

the way you say, but need not be.

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

But I think you can resolve

17

the ambiguity in the use of the word "issue" by looking

18

at the rest of (a)(3), which again ties the decision

19

under (a)(1) to reviewability by the EEOC.

20

think there is any dispute that the EEOC can only review

21

board decisions that involve an issue of discrimination,

22

either an interpretation of an antidiscrimination law or

23

an application of such a law to the facts of the case.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't

I have a problem,

because to accept your reading is to say that judicially
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reviewable action differs between 7702 and the escape

2

hatch, because the only way the escape hatch can work,

3

it, too, cross-references 7702 in the same way that the

4

provisions you are relying on do.

5

both should be given identical meaning, because they

6

both cross-reference 7702; and yet your brief says, no,

7

we shouldn't have that absurd result.

8

MS. HARRINGTON:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Under your reading

But not because -It seems to me that if

10

you concede that there is an absurd result in applying

11

your interpretation to the escape hatch, by definition,

12

your meaning can't be ascribable to that phrase.

13

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, so just to be clear,

14

we think the phrase "judicially reviewable action"

15

should be given the same meaning in section (e) that it

16

is given elsewhere in 7702.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MS. HARRINGTON:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

Our view is --

MS. HARRINGTON:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

So when does the time

frames of the escape hatch commence --

21

23

So if the board --

So --- if the board hasn't

rendered any decision on anything?
MS. HARRINGTON:

Exactly.

If the -- if the

appeal is still pending before the board, that's when
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the escape hatch of (e) comes in, because it's just

2

intended to prevent employees from being held hostage by

3

board inaction.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right, but Justice Sotomayor

5

is right, that when you define "judicially reviewable

6

action" in your way, then 7702(e)(1)(B) becomes

7

nonsensical and you have to save it by inserting

8

additional language, by saying, you know, "and other" --

9

"and other kinds of action."

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

No, it only becomes

11

nonsensical if you think it should apply to cases that

12

are no longer pending before the board under section

13

7702.

14

the decision in this case, it issued a decision under

15

section 7701 which is the general provision governing

16

board decisions, and then the case was no longer pending

17

under section 7702.

18

apply the escape hatch to cases in that situation.

19

In our view, once the board issued a decision --

And so it wouldn't make sense to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it wouldn't make

20

sense, but it's what the language would command if

21

"judicially reviewable action" means what you say

22

"judicially reviewable action" means.

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

It is true that our

24

commonsense gloss on the statute is not found in the

25

text of the statute.

But I think once the -- once the
50


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case has been decided under section 7701 on procedural

2

grounds, it's no longer a 7702 case before the board.

3

And so there is just no reason to think that subsection

4

(e) would apply in the -- in that situation.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You still have an

6

exhaustion argument to raise if we were to send this to

7

the district court?

8
9

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, we raised that

exhaustion argument as an alternative ground before the

10

district court.

The district court construed this case

11

as seeking review of the board's decision, not seeking

12

review of the agency's decision.

13

challenge that district court holding before the eighth

14

circuit in her opening brief.

15

issue in the cert petition papers, and so I think, although

16

now she's suggested in the merits briefing that this case --

17

this Court maybe should really just decide whether she's

18

seeking review of the agency decision instead of the

19

board decision, in our view that's not really a question

20

that is presented in -- in the case any longer.

21

view she is seeking review over the board decision, the

22

board decision decided that her appeal was untimely,

23

that there wasn't good cause to excuse the untimeliness.

24

There is no indication anywhere in the statute that

25

Congress would have wanted that kind of board decision

Petitioner did not

She didn't flag that as

51

And so in our view it does not fall within -- in the
