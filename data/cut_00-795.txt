ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


8
9

MR. CLEMENT:
please the court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it


In 1996 Congress updated the child


10

pornography laws to keep pace with technological


11

developments.

12

on visual depictions of actual children engaged in


13

sexually explicit conduct to cover virtually


14

indistinguishable images in material pandered as child


15

pornography.

16

same basic reason that other laws prohibiting child


17

pornography have been upheld. They protect real children


18

from real abuse.


19

Congress extended the existing prohibitions


These provisions are constitutional for the


They do so in two important ways.

First, by


20

preventing the publication and production of materials


21

that are as effective as traditional child pornography in


22

seducing children, and second, by allowing the government


23

to effectively prosecute cases involving traditional forms


24

of child pornography.


25

First, these provisions allow the government to

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

attack material that poses the same risk of enticing


2

children into illicit sexual activities and to pose for


3

child pornography as traditional child pornography.


4

The government has a clear and compelling


5

interest in targeting such material; indeed, this court in


6

Osborne against Ohio used that rationale to uphold Ohio's


7

prohibition on the possession of child pornography.


8

Second and equally important, the government has


9

a clear interest in promoting the effective prosecution of


10

the traditional laws against traditional forms of child


11

pornography.

12

computer technology has allowed individuals to generate


13

computer images that are virtually indistinguishable from


14

traditional photographs.

15

to inject reasonable doubt arguments into virtually every


16

case.


17

The advent and increasing availability of


QUESTION:

This allows criminal defendants


Has any case, to your knowledge, been


18

lost on that ground in which that was a substantial


19

argument?


20

MR. CLEMENT:

No case has been lost on that


21

ground but that is largely a result of the 1996 Act, which


22

has taken that argument away from criminal defendants. 


23

And to give you one very specific example, the case that


24

the Fifth Circuit heard in the Fox case, United States


25

against Fox which is one of the cases where the lower

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

courts upheld this law in an as applied context, the


2

government's expert witness, Special Agent Barkhausen was


3

forced on cross-examination to admit that she could not


4

tell definitively whether or not the image was of a real


5

child.

6

likely have been fatal to the government's prosecution.


7

Now that concession prior to the 1996 Act would


QUESTION:

Was that because she couldn't tell


8

whether the real child was over 18 or under 18 or because


9

she couldn't tell whether it was a real person?


10
11
12

MR. CLEMENT:

That case was because she couldn't


tell it was a real person.

QUESTION:

Wouldn't she have the same difficulty


13

on the distinction between an 18-year-old and a


14

19-year-old?


15

MR. CLEMENT:

In the cases where the line that


16

the courts are concerned with is the line between 18 and


17

19, there's an additional aspect of the statute that


18

clears up many of the problems and that's the affirmative


19

defense which allows individuals to produce and distribute


20

materials if they make clear they involve actual


21

individuals who are over 18.


22

QUESTION:

But in terms of what you outlined, in


23

terms of the two dangers, you say just the same as if it


24

were an actual child.

25

who looks like a child, it seems to me everything that you


Well, if it's a very young adult


5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said about the virtual pornography would apply to a young


2

adult who looks like a child.


3

MR. CLEMENT:

That's certainly true, but I think


4

Congress in recognizing an affirmative defense for


5

materials that were produced using people who had reached


6

the age of majority struck a balance and recognized that


7

this Court has provided additional protection to


8

pornographic depictions involving actual adults.


9

QUESTION:

Okay, well the question of the


10

balance raises the question of tailoring, and what I


11

wanted to ask you was if it's appropriate to have the


12

affirmative defense that the children or that the people


13

depicted were in fact over 18, why isn't it equally


14

appropriate to have an affirmative defense to the effect


15

that the depiction does not have anyone who is not a real


16

child under 18.

17

interests are protected by the affirmative defense in the


18

real child case, why shouldn't there be a comparable


19

affirmative defense for the simulation.


20

In other words, if the government's


MR. CLEMENT:

I think there are at least two


21

reasons for that differential treatment.

One is with


22

respect to age that's a fact that's uniquely verifiable


23

and in a lot of contexts we recognize that somebody's age


24

is something that one can verify.

25

really talking about in most of these cases where the


And in fact what we're


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

affirmative defense for age would be implicated are films


2

and the like where there would be witnesses who could


3

testify that somebody was of a particular age on a


4

particular date.


5

QUESTION:

But in effect you're depending on the


6

witness to say that the actors here were in fact over 18. 


7

Maybe they'll produce facsimiles of birth certificates or


8

maybe they'll produce children or whatnot.

9

have the same evidence to the effect that there were no


Why can't you


10

real children being used in manufacturing the film? 


11

You're depending on witnesses in each case.


12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, in most of the cases when


13

you're talking about somebody who's going to make the


14

claim that they actually generated the photographs


15

themselves, there will be no witnesses. But I think more


16

important than the presence or absence of witnesses is --


17

QUESTION:

But that's a question of proof and I


18

suppose that if the only person who steps up to the stand


19

and says, there were no live children here, is the person


20

who was accused of the pornography, that person may have


21

something to worry about in not having a very convincing


22

affirmative defense.

23

not the government's problem.


24
25

But that's the defendant's problem,


And so I don't think that answers the question,

why if the government is sufficiently protected with the

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

affirmative defense in the one class of cases it wouldn't


2

be in the other.


3

MR. CLEMENT:

And I do think that age rather


4

than whether an image is computerally generated is


5

something that is uniquely subject to verification and


6

this Court in its Ferber decision confronted the argument


7

that the New York statute was overbroad because it didn't


8

limit its protections to photographs and images that were


9

produced in the state of New York.


10

And the court rejected that overbreadth argument


11

for two reasons; one, that it would be virtually


12

impossible for anybody to prove what was the state of


13

origin for the photo.

14

applies for a computer generated image. The second reason,


15

of course, was that even materials --


16

QUESTION:

And I think the same analysis


Why is it -- why is it that witnesses


17

can explain the age but cannot explain whether it was


18

computer generated?


19

MR. CLEMENT:

Because, again, in sort of the


20

stylized case that the person who's computer generated an


21

image, that's not something that requires a film crew to


22

be brought in so there aren't necessarily going to be


23

witnesses.

24
25

In the case --

QUESTION:

problem.

But that's not the government's


I mean, that may be the problem of the person

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

who has the burden of proof to carry on the affirmative


2

defense and if it is a problem then the government is the


3

-- in effect going to be the winning party in resolving


4

that problem, but like Justice Stevens, I don't see what


5

is essentially unique in the probative process to acclaim


6

that it was a computer generation rather than a claim that


7

the kid shown was over 18.


8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'm not sure it's absolutely


unique but I do think age is uniquely subject to


10

verification.

And if I could get to the second reason


11

that this Court pointed out in Ferber why you didn't need


12

to have a limitation just to pictures generated in the


13

State of New York, the Court recognized in footnote 19


14

that those materials, even if produced outside the State


15

of New York, pose harms and potential risk to children


16

inside the State of New York.


17

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, may I ask you a question


18

again relating to the affirmative defenses or youthful


19

adult pornography.

20

defense for possession of something that in fact used


21

adults, is that right?


22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

statute.

24

possession.


25

There appears to be no affirmative


That's right as a matter of the


There's no express affirmative defense for


QUESTION:

Well, let's relate that to something

9

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that perhaps a number of people in this courtroom have


2

seen.

3

who purports to be under 18 engaged in conduct that would


4

fit under the definition of the statute to be banned,


5

right.


The film, Traffic, which depicts I guess someone

MR. CLEMENT:

QUESTION:

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

(Laughter.)


10

QUESTION:

I believe that's true.


Did you see it?

I did see it.


Okay.

So presumably it would be


11

covered.

12

the movie, they possess it, no affirmative defense.


13

Now, there is no defense to someone who rents


MR. CLEMENT:

There's no affirmative defense for


14

possession but I think what the statute does is it


15

effectively makes it so that in virtually, in the vast


16

majority of cases where the producers and distributors of


17

a film will be able to claim the affirmative defense, the


18

individual possessor will be able to claim the affirmative


19

defense because of a failure of the government's ability


20

to prove scienter, because if you think about the


21

affirmative defense it gives people the ability to


22

distribute a movie if it involves actors.

23

have the right to distribute a movie that nobody can


24

lawfully possess, it doesn't give them much, that's not


25

much comfort to them.


But if they

1

QUESTION:

I don't understand.

I mean I buy at


2

the video store three films, Traffic, Lolita, and Titanic. 


3

Each film has a scene of simulated sexual behavior by


4

17-year-olds, all right?

5

The question is, why am I not guilty under your


6

interpretation of the statute of a federal crime for


7

possessing those three films?


8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that was the question. 


There's two reasons.

One is


precisely in order to deal with this anomaly that they


10

don't want to be producing a film that nobody can lawfully


11

possess, the affirmative defense gives an incentive to


12

producers and distributors to make it clear in the


13

marketing of the material that those scenes that you're


14

talking about were scenes that were produced using adults


15

or scenes used with body doubles, and so in that sense


16

through the marketing of the material they can make it


17

clear to people that it involved adults.


18

QUESTION:

There is the defense for the


19

producer, but there isn't for the person who rents the


20

film.

It's just I --


21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

QUESTION:

Exactly.


-- I'm struck by what we're supposed


23

to do with a statute like this.


24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

There is a requirement, though,


that the government prove scienter with respect to age in

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

any prosecution for possession and I don't see how the


2

government could prove scienter as to age in the case of


3

these films where they're marketed in a way where it's


4

clear that they involve adult actors.


5

There's a second aspect in which this Court


6

could find the affirmative defense to cover individuals


7

and that -- individual possessors, and that is the statute


8

does give an affirmative defense for receipt and as the


9

government argued in its briefs that naturally would cover


10
11

possession incident to receipt.

What it doesn't cover, though, and why I think


12

Congress didn't have a blanket affirmative defense for


13

possession is it doesn't apply to somebody who receives


14

some material that's marketed in a way or has a disclaimer


15

that makes it clear that it involves adult actors, but


16

then the individual somehow modifies it, strips out the


17

disclaimer.

18

the statute and I think rightly so.


19

In that case, the possession is covered by


QUESTION:

Does it trouble you at all that the


20

statute would prohibit a motion picture company from


21

employing an 18-year-old actress to play the three roles


22

that Justice Breyer identified?


23

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it would trouble me if the


24

statute had that effect but it doesn't have that effect. 


25

The affirmative defense makes it crystal clear.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:
statutory age, 18?


3
4

Even though the actress is under the


MR. CLEMENT:

Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said


18.


5

QUESTION:

Would it trouble you that the statute


6

would prohibit an 18-year-old who is a child under the


7

statute from performing those three roles?


8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think it's 17, but in any


event it doesn't trouble me if it's a 17-year-old is


10

prohibited because they wouldn't be prohibited from


11

playing those roles if -- the studio would have two


12

options.

13

explicit conduct which is all that's covered by the


14

statute, and I think it would be possible to have made the


15

film Traffic without involving simulated sexual activity.


16

They could either not include the sexually


But putting that to the side, the other option


17

is to use a body double and make it clear in the marketing


18

of the film that that's precisely what you've done.


19

QUESTION:

I take it your answer to the question


20

if this afternoon I go out, go to the video store, buy the


21

three films and bring them home is, yes, I am guilty of a


22

federal crime.


23

MR. CLEMENT:

Not at all.

You could not be


24

guilty because the government could not prove scienter and


25

because you would have lawful --

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

What do you mean you can't prove


2

scienter?

It says that it is a crime to buy, to possess a


3

film that has simulated sexual activity by persons who


4

appear to be under the age of 18. Well, I would tell you


5

right now, I think that film did contain simulated sexual


6

activity by persons who appeared to be under the age of


7

18.


8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

QUESTION:

And again --


I don't think it was real activity, I


10

think it was simulated, and I think they did appear to me


11

to be under the age of 18.

12

MR. CLEMENT:

So am I guilty or not?


You are not guilty for the two


13

reasons that I've said and let me just say that you would


14

have the same problem with respect to the statute at issue


15

in Ferber.


16

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, I'm not sure what


17

simulated sexual activity consists of.

18

of these movies.


19

(Laughter.)


20

QUESTION:

21

(Laughter.)


22

QUESTION:

I didn't see any


They were pretty good actually.


One described in the briefs


23

supposedly was the shot of a juvenile, whether played by a


24

juvenile or not, from the waist up supposedly engaged in


25

sexual activity.

Would you consider that to be covered by

14

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the statute as sexually explicit conduct?

2

it was just the hand?


3

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean what if


Well, certainly if it was just the


4

hand and certainly -- I think there would be certainly a


5

number of ways --


6

QUESTION:

Don't you think, I mean the


7

definition of sexually explicit conduct is and what the


8

statute prohibits is this conduct by minors under 17 or


9

younger, sexual intercourse, engaging in sexual


10

intercourse, bestiality, masturbation, sadistic or


11

masochistic abuse or lascivious exhibition of the genitals


12

or pubic area.

13

argument that at least as applied to juveniles this is


14

unprotected speech anyway and consists of obscenity which


15

a state or federal government is free, if it wishes, to


16

prohibit?


17

Now, the government has not made the


MR. CLEMENT:

To the contrary, the government


18

has argued throughout this case that it's all unprotected


19

speech because it's child pornography.

20

QUESTION:

And I think 
 --

Not because it's obscenity, you're


21

creating, you would have us create yet another category of


22

prohibitive, something that falls totally outside the


23

first amendment.

24

suggested you might have, that at least some of this


25

material is obscene and therefore covered without regard


Have you claimed, as Justice Scalia


15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to any new, any child pornography catalog -- category.


2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I want to be clear, I think


3

government would take the position that virtually all the


4

material covered by this statute is independently obscene,


5

but that's not how the government chose to regulate it.


6

QUESTION:

If the scene of a head of a person


7

who the other information in the movie makes it appear


8

they're engaged in sexual intercourse and all that is seen


9

is the head of a male and a female kissing one another,


10

that would come covered by the statute.


11
12

MR. CLEMENT:
covered by the statute.


13
14

No, I don't think that would be


QUESTION:

Why not?

It's simulated sexual


intercourse.


15

MR. CLEMENT:

I think you have to read the term


16

simulated sexual intercourse in conjunction with the other


17

terms in the statute.


18

QUESTION:

It expressly says there's no patently


19

offensive requirement.


20

MR. CLEMENT:

That's certainly true but I think


21

if you read the statute in context, I think there's some


22

requirement that the sexual intercourse that would be


23

depicted would require some display of nudity in the


24

process.

25

that and the statute itself may not address that case. 


Certainly -- well, it doesn't -- it may not say


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And I would suggest that the proper way to resolve that


2

case is in an as applied challenge.

3

government to bring that prosecution.

4

the government won't bring that prosecution.

5

interesting to talk about the film version of Lolita and


6

the like but that involves just a tiny fraction of


7

materials covered by this statute, and if you want to bet


8

--

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Wait for the

In fact, I think

I mean, it's


Ferber pretty much said that child


pornography is of almost no value, did it not?

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely, and that's why this


12

material that we're talking about is all probably


13

virtually, the government could capture it as obscenity


14

but of course if it tried to do that it couldn't ban the


15

possession, and child pornography was treated as a


16

different case in Ferber.


17

QUESTION:

18

but very much like obscenity.


19

Child pornography is a different case


MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely, like obscenity, what


20

this Court said in Ferber is the reason the statute was


21

permissible is because it defined a category of conduct


22

that could be proscribed and was outside the protection of


23

the First Amendment.


24
25

QUESTION:

There's a vast difference between an


actual child who was violated and a picture, a simulation

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in Ferber that you have relied on so heavily, what do you


2

make of a sentence that is not in the footnote, it is the


3

text, that simulation outside the prohibition and the


4

prohibition was using an actual child, simulation outside


5

the prohibition could provide an alternative?


6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, let me just clarify one


7

thing because the statute in Ferber itself also covered


8

simulated sexual activity so all these line drawing


9

problems about what, you know, at what point does the


10

scene in Traffic come under the coverage of the statute


11

also applied in Ferber because it also captured simulated


12

acts involving adults.

13

coverage of this statute and Ferber is that this statute


14

does attempt to prohibit materials that do not involve


15

actual individuals but are virtually indistinguishable


16

from --


17

QUESTION:

So the only difference between the


Yes, but even that sentence in Ferber


18

said we're not touching in this case, here we have an


19

actual child simulation outside that prohibition could


20

provide an alternative.


21

MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, I don't think that's


22

what Ferber meant to say.

23

decided in 1982.


24
25

QUESTION:

I mean, Ferber, after all, was


It used those words.

It used those


words.

1

MR. CLEMENT:

It did, but it was decided in 1982


2

before this technology even existed.

3

if you look at footnote 20 in the Ferber opinion the Court


4

went out of its way to invoke the general doctrine that


5

you don't apply cases before they arise and you don't


6

adopt a rationale any broader than necessary to decide the


7

case before it.

8
9
10
11

And interestingly,


And it just seems to me --


QUESTION:

What if we read that sentence as


though it were not there?

MR. CLEMENT:

No I think you read it in the


context --


12

QUESTION:

Not in the opinion.


13

MR. CLEMENT:

-- with respect, I think you treat


14

it in the context of what was prohibited by the New York


15

statute and the technology that was available at the time. 


16

And I think what's important here is any avenues for


17

speech that were left open in Ferber are left open by the


18

statute in conjunction with the affirmative defense.

19

only materials that are covered by the statute and not


20

covered by Ferber are materials that didn't exist at the


21

time of Ferber and it seems to me that Congress is


22

entitled to update the tech -- the pornography and


23

obscenity laws to deal with technological developments.


24
25

The


The first federal obscenity statute in 1842

didn't cover photographs because the technology wasn't in

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

widespread use at the time.

2

photographs to the cover to the obscenity statutes because


3

technology developed and new problems arose.


4

QUESTION:

Subsequently Congress added


The Court relied very heavily on the


5

notion that if you use actual children they are harmed,


6

they are actually harmed, so what is the primary reliance


7

that you make for applying the same prohibition to these


8

video images?


9

MR. CLEMENT:

Well I think there's -- I would


10

make two responses.

11

strictly limited itself to the protection of the child


12

depicted in the image and it recognizes that legislatures


13

in Congress have an interest in protecting all children


14

but secondly --


15
16

QUESTION:

First, I think this Court has never


It did seem to me that the Court, and


I was here, played heavy reliance on harm to children.


17

MR. CLEMENT:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Absolutely.


Actual children.

So I'm asking you


what is your primary reliance when you don't have that?

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't know that we have to


21

answer that question in this case because we do have that,


22

because this statute enables the government to continue to


23

prosecute effectively cases involving traditional forms of


24

child pornography, because the advent --


25

QUESTION:

But that's not an answer to Justice

20

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

O'Connor's question.

Basically we're talking here about


2

overbreadth and the government's argument seems to be that


3

since there is a class of materials that we can proscribe,


4

the fact that it's overly broad is the respondent's


5

problem.

6

to show that this statute is precise as to its coverage


7

and that it covers no more and let's just for argument's


8

sake, although I don't think that's the law, concede not


9

substantially more than what can be prohibited.

But the law works the other way around, you have


And


10

Justice O'Connor's question was directed to this latter


11

problem and it seems to me you're not answering the


12

question.


13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'm trying to and I think


14

that, I mean, first of all, even in an overbreadth


15

challenge the burden does lie on the party challenging the


16

statute and they have to show things from actual fact in


17

order to challenge the statute and I don't think they've


18

carried that burden.


19

Second, this statute is responsive to the


20

problem of protecting both the children depicted in the


21

image and all children who can be seduced or enticed into


22

this kind of activity can be depicted themselves.


23

QUESTION:

But the gravamen of her question,


24

Justice O'Connor can explain her own question, but as I


25

understood it, is that there's a substantial area here

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

where adults who are play acting roles of children are


2

covered, and the question is what is the government's


3

interest in that?


4

MR. CLEMENT:

There isn't an interest in those


5

play acting cases and that's why the affirmative defense


6

allows those to take place.

7

you indicated substantial overbreadth and these questions


8

we're talking about, about Traffic and the film version of


9

Lolita really are a tiny fraction of the cases covered by


10
11

But again, the question is as


the statute.

QUESTION:

Why is it that the question I really


12

would like you to get to if you can is one that's really


13

bothering me very much is the question that Justice Scalia


14

asked and the thing in this area I do not understand, in


15

the entire area is why doesn't Miller work?

16

obviously a set of materials which Justice Stewart used to


17

refer to as I know it when I see it and that material does


18

not have at its object communication.

19

object a certain activity which is not communication.

20

that's all over our society, and why, given this Court's


21

decision in Miller, is that so?

22

to that question I would be better able to deal with this


23

kind of case.


24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

There is


It has at its

Now


And if I knew the answer


Well, let me first try to say two


reasons why I don't think Miller is directly relevant and

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

if those aren't responsive to your questions, maybe --


2

QUESTION:

I'd rather not hear why it's directly


3

-- not directly relevant because my question, which is my


4

own problem, not your problem, is I'm trying to understand


5

the area.

6

this is not the only one, and I want to know from the


7

government why it is, you've read in this area, maybe you


8

just should direct me to an article.

9

personally am having as a judge is I think what Justice


There are several cases in this area coming up,


The problem I


10

Scalia was driving at, maybe, that's his question, is why


11

doesn't Miller work.

12

does, but that's contrary

13

seems to me I see much material that would have flunked


14

Justice Stewart's test all over the place.

15

to me that that's the material that parents are worried


16

about their children getting a hold of.


17

Now maybe you'll tell me that it

to my experience because it


And it seems


Now, if I knew why Miller was insufficient to


18

deal with that problem I would know better how to deal


19

with this kind of a case.


20

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, one reason that Miller is a


21

difficult case and doesn't -- isn't terribly satisfying is


22

it requires a case by case adjudication of that


23

three-prong test which I would say with deference is not


24

self-defining.

25

context is follow the lead of Ferber where it said that


And what Congress decided to do in this


23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Miller wasn't the test of child pornography and defined a


2

much clearer class of material that whether or not it


3

applies in Miller, whether or not the work as a whole is


4

implicated, this is a definable class of material that is


5

outside the protection of the First Amendment.


6

If you have concerns about the Miller test then


7

you really should seize upon this statute and Ferber and


8

the analysis in Osborne as one way to deal with that


9

problem because here's a test that doesn't rely on


10

community standards or other difficult considerations to


11

apply in practice.

12

talking about visual depictions only, we're not talking


13

about novels here, and we're talking about material that


14

depicts children engaged in sexually explicit conduct then


15

we don't have to look to the value of the work as a whole. 


16

You can put all the Shakespeare around these visual


17

depictions you'd like and they're still visual depictions


18

of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct.


19

QUESTION:

It has a test that says when we're


Mr. Clement, before you finish


20

there's something of great concern to me too because it


21

seems that this is a big step away from actual child,


22

injury to an actual child to the effect on the viewer and


23

the same thing could be said for women with respect to


24

pornography, portraying women in a degrading way.

25

same thing could be said for hate speech.

The


So this, where


24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there is no actual child victim, where it's a picture and


2

you're talking about the effect of that on the viewer, why


3

isn't it the same for all these other things that can have


4

a very bad effect on the viewer?


5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think there are two


6

principal reasons why you shouldn't be worried about that


7

particular slippery slope.

8

one foot down that slope in Osborne when it relied on the


9

seduction rationale in conjunction with the concern for


One is this Court already put


10

the children who were depicted. And in the same way this


11

statute responds both to harm, potential harm, to other


12

children in the seduction rationale and to children


13

actually depicted because as a matter of practical reality


14

it's become very difficult for the government to prosecute


15

cases involving actual, traditional child pornography.


16

QUESTION:

If you have this out you can use


17

simulated children, that will protect the actual children


18

from being exploited.

19

the other?


20

MR. CLEMENT:

Why can't you say one as much as


Because I think, as I indicated


21

before, there are real verifiability problems that don't


22

arise in the context of age that do arise in computer.


23

The second reason, though, I think that you have


24

to be less worried about the slippery slope in this


25

context is the government has consistently gone to the

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

courts and told them to interpret appears to be to cover


2

images that are virtually indistinguishable from


3

traditional child pornography. It doesn't seem to put this


4

Court on a slippery slope to say that material that is


5

virtually indistinguishable from material that's already


6

been held to be outside the protection of the First


7

Amendment also will be outside the protection of the First


8

Amendment.


9
10

QUESTION:

Are you asking us to read that phrase


into the statute, the virtually indistinguishable phrase?


11

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, the virtually


12

indistinguishable phrase already appears in the text of


13

the statute, it just doesn't appear in the operative


14

provision.

15

term, appears to be, in light of the legislative finding,


16

where it's not just the legislative finding where it's


17

virtually indistinguishable.


18

QUESTION:

So what we're asking you to do is to read that


You're asking us to construe the


19

statute narrowly to apply only to things that are


20

virtually indistinguishable from actual behavior, it would


21

eliminate cartoons and that sort of stuff?


22
23
24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

That's absolutely right and that's


the position we've taken in all the lower courts.

QUESTION:

Even the language that says conveys


the impression, you want us to give the same meaning to

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that?


2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I actually think that the


3

conveys the impression language could be given that


4

meaning but I think the conveys the impression language is


5

much less problematic from a constitutional standpoint if


6

you understand subsection D of the statute to be addressed


7

to pandering and in that context the concerns about


8

vagueness are much reduced because you're not going to be


9

focused on just the image, you're going to be focused on


10

the way it's marketed, and I think in that context it


11

won't be difficult to see whether or not it conveys the


12

image.

13

rebuttal.

This only applies to the movie?

MR. SIRKIN:

to portray it.

from showing or simulated sexual activity because if they

are in fact, you know, to be considered to be underage. 


17

And secondly, countless visual depictions of adult


18

sexuality will be prohibited where the adults depicted

appear to some unknown censor to be younger than 18.

and/or abused by a small segment of society.

MR. SIRKIN:

And where children, where you're


Your honor, there's --

How is Congress to write a statute in


10

the area of children that gets at that problem, which is a


11

problem?


12

MR. SIRKIN:

I believe that Title 18, section


13

2251 covers that problem.

14

numerous prosecutions, I think, prior to the passages of


15

this Act.

16

testified before the Senate committee that heard evidence


17

about this statute and indicated that there had been a


18

conviction rate of over 97 percent in cases that had been


19

brought against people for the possession or dissemination


20

of material containing a depiction of a minor.


21

In the past there have been


In 1995 a member of the Department of Justice


So that in fact has not been a problem in the


22

past and apparently in this all in umbrella statute where

they used any visual depiction, which in fact if you use

the terminology any visual depiction it's not just limited


25

to virtually indistinguishable --

QUESTION:

You have no problem then with the


2

statute before it was amended.


3

MR. SIRKIN:

4

statute, 2251 and 2252 did exist.


5
6
7

I have no problem, this is a new


QUESTION:

What did it do?

How did it change


the law?

MR. SIRKIN:

It used the terminology, it created


8

a category of computer images that would be nonreal or


9

other pictures or images that are nonreal and that are


10

fictional characters into the act and it would be


11

prohibited if disseminated or possessed.


12

QUESTION:

So, well, whatever was going to be


13

threatened in the way of free expression and so forth


14

under the new act was simply computer images of things


15

that were already prohibited if done by real people?


16

MR. SIRKIN:

No it did not, it included, it said


17

any visual depiction, that would include that could be


18

considered cartoons, illustrations, drawings, paintings.


19

QUESTION:

If the statute is construed to be,


20

say, virtually indistinguishable then I think cartoons


21

would not be covered.


22

MR. SIRKIN:

But the problem is it would still


23

suffer from the vagueness because what would happen is


24

that in fact I had a computer image of a fictional


25

character I'd never have a defense because I could not

come forward and prove that that fictional character was

over 18.

discretion.

what will happen.

10

It may be that the current administration may


QUESTION:

You could cross that bridge when you


come to it then.


11

MR. SIRKIN:

Well, I believe when you begin to


12

talk about First Amendment rights to put it on to a case


13

by case basis I think you are abridging, you know, a


14

fundamental right and I think that in addition to that you


15

have the problem that if I get charged you're not just


16

being charged with a violation of an obscenity law, you're


17

being accused of being a child pornographer and that does


18

have some connotation and that has some ill effects just


19

from the fact of being charged.

20

defense.


21
22

QUESTION:

And I would have no


Well, does it cover things beyond


obscene speech?


23

MR. SIRKIN:

24

25

MR. SIRKIN:

32

Alderson Reporting Company

1

you know, the morphing situation --


2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SIRKIN:

Excuse me?

I'm using the term morphing where


4

you use an identifiable and you can merge it in on the


5

computer to, you know, into similar --


6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SIRKIN:

8
9
10
11

Images of obscenity.

That's correct, or of a sexual act


-QUESTION:

That is the expansion, is covering


images of obscenity.

MR. SIRKIN:

Well, it would be images, it would


12

be copying images of obscenity with an identifiable


13

individual or in sexual conduct and that is harm to a real


14

child because that person is an identifiable child and


15

that becomes a permanent record.


16

QUESTION:

But does it cover depictions of


17

something more than obscenity?


18

MR. SIRKIN:

Well, when you use the terminology


19

simulated sexual activity it would, you know, it depends,


20

I guess that goes community to community.

21

have is like in the movie Trafficking where you have a


22

young lady under a cover with a man on top of her, you


23

only see their heads but, you know, the simulated means


24

the appearance of, and that in fact does give the


25

appearance and, you know, in that situation it is a


But what you

1

representation in the movie that that person is under the


2

age of 18 --


3

QUESTION:

Don't you think the statute can


4

reasonably be read giving the definition of the activities


5

covered not to cover two people under a bed with no


6

depiction of sexual organs or anything else.


7

MR. SIRKIN:

The problem is, is that the statute


8

uses the term actual sexual activity and/or simulated, and


9

again 
 --

10

QUESTION:

It depends on what you mean by sexual


11

activity.

12

of the sexual organs it's certainly reasonable to say that


13

that isn't covered.


14
15
16
17
18

If it's just a depiction without any indication


MR. SIRKIN:

But that's not what the statute


says, though.

QUESTION:

Well, the statute does say explicit. 


Doesn't that cover what Justice Scalia --

MR. SIRKIN:

No it doesn't, because it says


19

explicit sexual conduct, actual or simulated and I guess


20

it depends on how you read that word simulated.


21
22
23

QUESTION:

You say explicit.

What work does the


term explicit do?

MR. SIRKIN:

It means clearly and again clearly


24

would mean to me that if it appears that they're under the


25

blanket and that's what they're doing I think it's a

Alderson Reporting Company

1

reasonable inference to be made and I think that it would

cover that as simulated activity.

something different than clearly.

simulated.

11

But explicit certainly can mean


It can, but it's not defined in the


They could have gotten rid of the word


QUESTION:

Then maybe the courts will define it


so that it wouldn't cover the kind of thing you're talking

about.

QUESTION:

It is defined in the statute,


12

sexually explicit conduct that was in quotes means actual


13

or simulated sexual intercourse.


14

MR. SIRKIN:

15

masturbation and --


16

QUESTION:

And some other things, and it uses


It includes sexual intercourse, it


17

seems to me it's sexual intercourse whether you see the


18

entire body or only part of it.


19

MR. SIRKIN:

I agree with Your Honor that it


20

would be simulated if they're under the blanket and you


21

see the heads.


22

QUESTION:

I think the question is whether you


23

could, a court could say well, to keep this within


24

constitutional bounds we will read into the statute this


25

broad requirement that there be an actual showing of

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sexual organs.


2

MR. SIRKIN:

You know, legislatures write


3

statutes, I think the courts interpret them and I think to


4

construe it you'd be basically rewriting the statute if


5

you did that, if you eliminated that terminology and I


6

don't think the government has urged that.


7

QUESTION:

Am I not correct in remembering that


8

one of the amendments to this series of statutes by


9

Congress specifically eliminated the requirement of


10

patently offensive and the like?


11

MR. SIRKIN:

They've done that in the child


12

pornography area a long time ago.

13

when they said that it, just if it merely is children


14

involved in sexual activity it's a violation of the law


15

and it's not subject to the three-prong test of Miller and


16

the patently offensive is a part of the Miller test.


17

QUESTION:

They did that in Ferber


Do you have any examples of the use


18

of computer generated images covered by this statute where


19

it has serious literary or educational value or scientific


20

value?


21

MR. SIRKIN:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SIRKIN:

Well --

Do we have examples of that?

Today I don't know that we have


24

examples today of that.

I mean, I would think that if we


25

convert the videos and the films that are being made today

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

into DVD, those are, that's a computer, digital computer


2

--

3

QUESTION:

Because your concern is with the


4

expansion to these images of things that are already


5

prohibited and yet I don't think we have examples of any


6

serious use of them in --


7

MR. SIRKIN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, if I --

-- areas which would be of concern. 


The examples that we've talked about today and that I


10

think you've identified seem to be of films using youthful


11

adults.


12

MR. SIRKIN:

Well, that would be correct but I


13

think it's not, you know, too in the distant future that


14

we will be making films that will be virtual reality.


15

QUESTION:

But they're their strongest argument


16

is -- I mean, I thought their argument is you're right,


17

those things you're talking about are not covered. 


18

They're not covered today because everybody knows they're


19

not really under the age of 18, the actors.

20

if we have a new system we'll worry about it tomorrow on a


21

case by case basis.

22

the top these are not real, I don't know what they'd have


23

to do, but they're so few and far between that we


24

shouldn't strike the statute down on its face.


25

And tomorrow


Maybe all they'd have to do is put on


Now that's why I think people are asking you for

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

particular examples because if you have to make up an


2

imaginary example that doesn't really exist then maybe the


3

correct thing to do is say the statute shouldn't be struck


4

down on its face and we'll proceed case by case as a


5

reasonable literary or scientific virtue to a particular


6

thing.

7

that's case by case.

8

argument here.


9

Of course the person can't be convicted.

Now


I'm putting what I take it is their


MR. SIRKIN:

But the problem with that is it


10

creates a chilling effect because who's going to take the


11

chance?

12

close to the line I think the petitioners have indicated


13

in their brief that if it's close to the line then just


14

don't do it, you know, don't publish it, don't make it,


15

and that's censorship.


16

I mean that's it, if the government says if it's


QUESTION:

What about the other argument which


17

is look, we're trying to protect the real children who are


18

the subjects of the film and the reason we need this to


19

protect them is because there is no way for any expert or


20

anyone else to say when they see a film whether this is a


21

film of a real person or whether it is a fake film made


22

through virtual technology.

23

us.


24
25

MR. SIRKIN:

The experts just can't tell


Well, I think that becomes, you


know, an excuse.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. SIRKIN:

3

QUESTION:

Is it true?

It is not true.

All right.

You think it is not true,


4

they think it is true.

5

could look or some place I could find out as to what


6

experts think?


7

MR. SIRKIN:

Is there somewhere in the record I


Yes, because I think you can look


8

at the Senate hearing report where it's indicated that in


9

1995 in relation to cases that were brought there was a


10

conviction rate of 97.6 percent. In addition to that, that


11

since the enactment of this law the government has not


12

lost a case and it was raised in the Kimbrough case and it


13

was raised in the Fox case, they were able to get a


14

conviction.


15

QUESTION:

You say the congressional finding is


16

wrong then because the statute begins with, among other


17

findings, new photographic and computer imaging


18

technologies make it possible to produce by electronic,


19

mechanical or other means visual depictions of what appear


20

to be children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that


21

are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer


22

from unretouched photographic images.

23

congressional finding is wrong?


24

MR. SIRKIN:

25

You say that that


That congressional finding, I don't


think it was empirically, there was no empirical evidence

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that was really shown to Congress that that is correct,


2

that the computer, and I believe, and I think it's clear


3

--

4
5

QUESTION:

So you have both your opponent and


the Congress who think you're wrong on this point.


6

MR. SIRKIN:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

Okay.

But your point still is, I


8

take it is, even if in fact the Congress is correct on


9

that, there's no evidence that cases are being lost


10

because of this virtual indistinguishability problem,


11

cases involving real children.


12

MR. SIRKIN:

That's correct.

And I believe if


13

you want to make it easier for the government to make


14

convictions I think that we could get rid of the Bill of


15

Rights and it would be much easier for the government then


16

to get convictions.


17

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement gave an example of


18

another case in which the government did obtain a


19

conviction but only because of the new statute in which


20

the government witness was unable to say.


21

MR. SIRKIN:

That was that government witness. 


22

That doesn't mean that there are not witnesses out there


23

and experts that can make that distinction that if, you


24

know, there clearly would be, pardon?


25

QUESTION:

This was just a bad government

40

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

witness, you say?


2

MR. SIRKIN:

It could have been.

I didn't hear


3

the testimony in that case but they did in fact get a


4

conviction in that case.

5

dangerous to create a barrier to First Amendment.


6
7

QUESTION:

Wouldn't have gotten a conviction if


the law had been what you want it to be, isn't that right?


8
9

But I think it's equally as


MR. SIRKIN:

We don't know they wouldn't have


gotten a conviction with that -- the testimony in that


10

case was that the expert indicated that he was not sure


11

and could not positively say whether it was real or not


12

real.


13

QUESTION:

And on that basis can you find beyond


14

a reasonable doubt that it was a depiction of an actual


15

minor.


16
17

MR. SIRKIN:

It creates an inference and a jury


can draw inferences from the evidence.


18

QUESTION:

Suppose the law put the burden on


19

you, on the defendant to show that this depiction does not


20

use an actual child.

21

problem, is not brought out, the confusion is it a real


22

child, is it a simulation. Suppose it were made the


23

defendant's burden to show that no actual child was used


24

in this picture, would you have a constitutional objection


25

to that?


The defendant, because of this proof


41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SIRKIN:

Yes, I would.

And the reason being


2

is that at least in the possession area that is not an


3

affirmative defense because all it has to be in the


4

affirmative defense, there is no, the element of age, of


5

being able to come forward and show that it's not a real


6

child or that it's underage is not available --


7

QUESTION:

Okay, let's assume that that too was


8

fixed.

9

inclusion of the possession is subject to the defense,


10

Those two features, Justice Ginsburg's and the


would the statute then be constitutional?


11

MR. SIRKIN: I, the possessor though, you'd be


12

switching the burden of proof then I believe and I think


13

that would be an unconstitutional shifting of the burden.


14

QUESTION:

Well, you'd be making, you be -- are


15

you saying that the affirmative defense therefore is, in


16

effect, has got to be constitutionally relevant across the


17

board?


18

MR. SIRKIN:

I believe that it is.

19

affirmative defense that's in this statute is


20

unconstitutional.


21
22

QUESTION:

So there's no way to tailor it by


affirmative defense in effect is your argument.


23

MR. SIRKIN:

24

QUESTION:

25

I think the


That's correct.

And how would that affirmative


defense prevent some of the evils that the government is

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

trying to prevent, for example the seduction of minors to


2

sexual conduct by showing things that appear to be minors? 


3

How would this, affirm -- the existence of this


4

affirmative defense still enable the government to do


5

that?


6

MR. SIRKIN:

There are currently, there are


7

currently lots of laws that deal with anyone who attempts


8

to entice a child and I believe that those laws could be


9

enforced and I believe that the penalties could be


10

increased and that could be a deterrent effect on that. 


11

We're talking about the use of this material potentially


12

by a very small segment of the population and I think it


13

affects --


14

QUESTION:

Well, you could say the same thing


15

about a murder statute, you know, you don't expect a whole


16

lot of people to go out and commit murders but that


17

doesn't mean Congress can't legislate against it.


18

MR. SIRKIN:

But here you can't legislate that


19

if it's not, if it's a virtual murder and there has been


20

no murder, you don't go out and arrest people.

21

you use a virtual, a fictional character you can go out


22

and arrest people.


23

QUESTION:

Here if


Well, if you want to talk about a


24

very small portion of the population I would think there's


25

a very small portion of the population that wants either

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to produce or to watch adolescents and children engaging


2

in sexual conduct of the sort described in this statute. 


3

You're dealing with a small portion of the population to


4

begin with.


5

MR. SIRKIN:

But if you use the principle that's


6

involved here then I do believe you begin the slippery


7

slope.

8

it, you can use it, you know, that if you have depictions


9

such as, you know, the movie the Godfather, the movie Pulp


You go from the idea you can use this and expand


10

Fiction which are cult, you know, movies that are


11

attractive to children, someone could come out and say,


12

hey, look, join my gang, look how much fun it can be if we


13

go out and become extremely violent.


14

QUESTION:

What's worrying me about what you're


15

saying now is that if their factual hypothesis is true,


16

which I tend to doubt, but I'm not an expert, that there


17

is no technical way to distinguish between a photograph of


18

a real child and an imaginary child, if it were true,


19

there is no expert who could tell you the difference and


20

you tell me I can not have an affirmative defense, then


21

the government cannot prosecute real child pornography.


22

MR. SIRKIN:

23

QUESTION:

I think they can --

Because there would be no way to


24

prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was a real child. 


25

So if you deny the government the possibility of the

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

affirmative defense weapon you are denying them the


2

possibility of prosecuting real child pornography.


3

MR. SIRKIN:

That's not correct because they've


4

been able to get convictions and they've gone forward and


5

they've gotten convictions.


6

QUESTION:

Well, presumably people think that it


7

is possible to distinguish between the real child and the


8

virtual fake.


9

MR. SIRKIN:

But I don't believe, you know, at


10

least currently they've not lost any of the cases and


11

there's only been the one where someone has raised the


12

issue and that expert had indicated that they weren't


13

sure.


14

QUESTION:

I think what you're doing is in


15

effect varying the question, you're saying, look, in the


16

real world it doesn't happen, they can tell.

17

assume the hypothesis that Justice Breyer started with,


18

the factual hypothesis that if these are well enough made


19

you can't tell the difference, then doesn't it follow that


20

if you rule out the affirmative defense route for the


21

government, the government simply won't be able to prove


22

the case in the instances in which real children are being


23

used.


24
25

MR. SIRKIN:

But if you


I'm going to go back and I'm not


begging the question, again, if I have, if there is

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

virtual murder that looks so real on the screen, I don't


2

go out and charge anyone with murder.


3

QUESTION:

Well, we can distinguish attraction


4

to other forms of socially damaging behavior from that


5

particular category of social -- socially damaging


6

behavior that has for hundreds of years been treated as


7

obscenity.

8

suddenly declaring that excessive violence constituted


9

obscenity.

I don't think there's any risk of the Court


We know what obscenity is.

There have been


10

laws against this particularly infectious kind of


11

solicitation to conduct for centuries.

12

you think we're going to suddenly flop over into


13

prohibiting the Godfather because that also portrays


14

socially undesirable conduct.


15

MR. SIRKIN:

I don't know why


If you take the logic that's behind


16

here about people, you're getting at the person who is


17

misusing the material and there certainly I think is, you


18

can't even do medical --


19

QUESTION:

Sexual material in a category called


20

obscenity which has traditionally for hundreds of years


21

been regulable by government.


22

MR. SIRKIN:

But the obscenity here we're making


23

just because it's a fictional character visually


24

participating in an activity that I can write about, we're


25

now saying you cannot express, that we're saying, we're

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

giving it a social status, and I think when we start to do


2

that then we start to eliminate, we can start eliminating


3

other areas equally.


4

I further believe that, you know, as I've


5

indicated, that the affirmative defense seems to be


6

inadequate.

7

possession and that individual is in a position where if


8

he has three images, if he gets a DVD movie and he takes,


9

and it has more than three images in it, he's now, you


It certainly does not cover the individual


10

know, can be prosecuted for possession of child


11

pornography.

12

put it together with the definition of simulated.


13

And, again, with the definition, when you


I think that it is not narrowly tailored, it is


14

overly broad because I think, again, it covers literary


15

material, it carries certainly for medical research, one


16

cannot, there is no bona fide exception here for medical,


17

scientific or educational or artistic merit, it's a


18

blanket across the board prohibition.

19

clearly indicated in Ferber --


20

QUESTION:

I believe the Court


But what if we accept the


21

government's limiting construction, the government is


22

urging that we use this, take the congressional finding,


23

read it into the text of the statute and then it would cut


24

out all the good things.


25

MR. SIRKIN:

I believe that the Court has

47

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

indicated in the past in Turner Broadcasting and in the


2

landmark communications case that it's not for the Court


3

to be rewriting statutes as they come out of Congress and


4

particularly in the area when it deals in areas of First


5

Amendment.

6

we're proposing here --


7

And I think that the Act, you know, and what


QUESTION:

Supposing that -- suppose we could


8

consult Congress, they would say yeah, preserve as much of


9

this as is constitutional.

We wanted to do a whole lot


10

but if the constitution only allows us to do a little we'd


11

rather have the Court say that than to throw out our


12

entire product.


13

MR. SIRKIN:

All we're asking is, is the Court


14

sever out two phrases and that is that is, is it appears


15

to be and that it, you know, and where it conveys the


16

impression that a minor is engaged in sexual activity.


17

QUESTION:

Well, in X-Citement Video we did


18

something not too different from this, reading in a


19

requirement that wasn't express in the statute.


20

MR. SIRKIN:

You did read in the elements of


21

knowingly and you have to do that.

Basically the


22

government is doing the same thing in this particular


23

statute because the knowingly appears in this statute


24

exactly as it appeared in the statute that was interpreted


25

by the Court in X-Citement Video.

It says knowingly in


48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

relation to mailing or to transporting, it doesn't say


2

knowing as to the knowledge of the particular minority.


3

QUESTION:

But that's an example of a case where


4

there was a First Amendment challenge where we have read


5

something into a statute that we might not necessarily


6

have done.


7

MR. SIRKIN:

8

QUESTION:

9

The Court has the power to do that.

And there's precedent for our doing


it.


10

MR. SIRKIN:

Yes, in X-Citement Video the Court


11

did do that.

But we're urging here that the fact is that


12

the Ferber and Osborne were based upon the harm to real


13

children and we're now limiting something because of the


14

message.

15

this is speech we don't like.


16

QUESTION:

We are socially making a determination here that


Are you saying that if real children


17

are not used in the depiction of simulated sexual activity


18

that it cannot be barred unless it meets the Miller


19

standard?


20

MR. SIRKIN:

21

QUESTION:

22

Yes.

It would mean --


Eight year olds, ten year olds,


twelve year olds.


23

MR. SIRKIN:

They're fictional characters,


24

because I think they do have a valid use in medical


25

research.

49
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

Suppose you said -- suppose you said


2

-- suppose I -- I don't know how I'd do it, suppose I


3

could draft a statute which had a medical research


4

exemption.


5

MR. SIRKIN:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SIRKIN:

It would make it narrower.

Would it be constitutional?

Again, I'd have to see the whole


8

statute and, again, I think that it would depend on how it


9

works and whether it still had the problems with the


10
11

affirmative defense.

QUESTION:

Suppose you took -- I just want to


12

follow up on what Justice Kennedy said.

13

Miller and said where you have clearly minors we as a


14

matter of law assume that it's patently offensive.


15

MR. SIRKIN:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Suppose you took


That could be done.

That could be done, you'd still have


the other two parts.

MR. SIRKIN:

Yes, and I think that most


19

communities would feel, I think that all communities would


20

feel that that is patently offensive.


21

QUESTION:

I wonder if Miller would work more


22

satisfactorily if you did that in the case of people who


23

clearly appear to be minors.


24

MR. SIRKIN:

25

QUESTION:

I believe that it would.

You think it would.
