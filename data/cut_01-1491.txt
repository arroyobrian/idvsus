Kim.

General Olson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. OLSON:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:

Based upon years of experience, study, hearings,


11
12

and overwhelming persuasive evidence, Congress concluded


13

that the prompt removal of aliens convicted of committing


14

serious felonies was essential to the Nation's ability to


15

control its borders. 
 Detention of these aliens during

16

removal proceedings was considered vital by Congress to


17

effectuate that policy, to prevent flight, to evade


18

removal, and to prevent harm done by recidivist criminal


19

aliens.


20

This is a facial substantive due process


21

challenge which cannot succeed unless there are no sets


22

of -- no set of circumstances under which the


23

congressional policy would be constitutional. 


24

As this Court has repeatedly --


25

QUESTION:

General Olson, do -- do we have


3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

authority to entertain this challenge?

2

amicus has raised a jurisdictional question, and I think


3

did it maybe in the court of appeals stage as well.

4

certainly did it early on here.


5

As you know, an


It


The problem is section 1126(e) which says, no


6

court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney


7

General under this section regarding the detention or


8

release of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial


9

of bond or parole.

Now, is that provision, number one,


10

inapplicable or, number two, unconstitutional?

11

neither of those, why doesn't it mean that we have no


12

authority to entertain this case? 


13

MR. OLSON:

And if


Justice Scalia, it's the


14

Government's position, as held by three courts of appeals,


15

that that provision does not apply to a habeas corpus

16

challenge to the constitutionality of the statute itself,


17

that the language of that provision relates to challenges


18

to an action by the Attorney General or administrative


19

action and does not preclude a challenge. 


20

QUESTION:

No.

It doesn't -- doesn't say the


21

challenge -- no.

22

action by the Attorney General.

23

for here is that we set aside the Attorney General's


24

action in detailing -- in detaining this alien.


25

It says, no court may set aside any


MR. OLSON:

And -- and what is asked


It's -- it's our submission, after


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

careful examination -- the Government originally took that


2

position that you've suggested in court proceedings.

3

was rejected by three courts of appeals.

4

further.

5

the conclusion that those decisions were correct and it


6

would not preclude -- and we're not contending here


7

today --


9

We studied it


The Government studied it further and came to


QUESTION:

8

It


And -- and you're relying on what


language to --

MR. OLSON:

10

Well, we're relying on the language


11

that it refers to, and a reasonable construction of the


12

statute refers to actions, administrative actions, by the


13

Attorney General or immigration -- administrative action


14

by administrative officials, and this Court's construction


15

of statutes against precluding constitutional challenges

16

to other statutes.

QUESTION:

17

Oh, but all of those other statutes


18

had some wiggle room I think, even St. Cyr, and there just


19

is no wiggle room here.

20

review.

21

by the Attorney General under this section.


22

It doesn't refer to judicial


It simply says, no court may set aside any action


QUESTION:

Even in the Quirin case where the --


23

the presidential order said that the people shall have no


24

access to the courts at all, this Court sat to hear


25

whether that sort of a provision was constitutional or


5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not.

MR. OLSON:

2

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,


3

and while it would be in the Government's interest to


4

preclude this challenge at all, we think a fair reading of


5

the Court's decisions, including the -- the Court -- the


6

decision that the Chief Justice mentioned, would to --


7

would be to construe that statute as not to preclude this


8

action in this case.

9

construction would lead to a -- a victory on behalf of the


10

Government in this case, but we've carefully examined it,


11

and we think that we're not advocating that position here


12

today. 

QUESTION:

13

Of course, that would lead -- your


Well, I appreciate your carefully


14

examining it, but I'd still like to know what language in


15

it leads your careful examination to conclude that it does

16

not cover this case.

17

that's another matter. 


18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

reason.

I mean, if it's unconstitutional,


Well, we -- we may be --

Maybe we'll strike it down for that


But my goodness --

MR. OLSON:

We -- we may be wrong, Justice


22

Scalia, but we're referring to and relying on the second


23

sentence which says, no court may set aside any action or


24

decision by the Attorney General under this section.

25

does not state -- and -- and we think the Court would


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It


1

construe it as not precluding a challenge to the


2

constitutionality of the -- of the policy made by the


3

Congress itself in enacting --

QUESTION:

4

It doesn't refer to the issue.

It


5

doesn't refer to the basis on which the setting aside is


6

done.

7

other than -- it doesn't even refer to the basis.

8

says, no court may set aside any action by the --


9

It doesn't say, may set aside, you know, on grounds


MR. OLSON:

It


I understand, Justice Scalia, and


10

the Government did, indeed, make that assertion, take that


11

position in early proceedings in this case.

12

rejected by three courts of appeals.

13

different conclusion after reexamining it, and that's our


14

position here today.


15

It was


We came to a


As this Court has repeatedly stated, Congress

16

has exceedingly broad latitude in dealing with aliens,


17

immigration, and the Nation's borders. 


18

QUESTION:

Can I have a quick answer just to --


19

you said a facial challenge.

20

a challenge brought by a resident alien who himself has a


21

plausible claim that the statute doesn't apply to him


22

because he's saying two -- you know, petty theft with a --


23

petty theft with a prior is not -- doesn't fall within the


24

category of crimes.

25

wrong, but shouldn't I consider the case of a person who


I've been assuming that it's


I don't know if that's right or


7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has a -- an arguable claim that he's outside the system? 

MR. OLSON:

2

Well, Justice Breyer, the -- the


3

case has not been litigated on that basis from its very


4

beginning.

5

appendix which is -- which, at the bottom of that section,


6

articulates the requested relief by the -- by the


7

respondent in this case.

8

that this provision is unconstitutional on its face as


9

violative --


I refer the Court to page 9 of the joint


QUESTION:

10

Petitioner seeks a declaration


It uses those words, I know.

I just


11

don't know how to consider it that way.

I mean, a person


12

who had no claim whatsoever -- am I supposed to consider


13

it on the basis of a person who has -- well, he would get


14

the removal order entered in 24 hours if he had no claim


15

whatsoever.


16

MR. OLSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

-- or somebody like the plaintiff


MR. OLSON:

If this -- not only is it in the


20
21

Well --

Is that who I'm supposed to consider?

Well, it --


here? 


22

petition for habeas corpus that the individual was


23

challenging on its face, the district court considered it


24

on that basis, and the Ninth Circuit considered it on that


25

basis, and it's been litigated here all the way through by


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- by the respondent on that basis.

2

be an as-applied challenge, there would be a great deal of


3

other considerations.


4

If there was to


And -- and this -- as this Court has said, the


5

facial challenge must be rejected unless there are no set


6

of circumstances under which the congressional policy


7

would be upheld. 


8

QUESTION:

9

MR. OLSON:

10

QUESTION:

11

the group somewhat?

12

the district court said the whole thing falls.

13

the Ninth Circuit said only as to lawfully admitted --


14

what was it?

15

not taking the whole thing at its face, but only a part of

16

the total group.


17

General Olson, didn't --

There -- there's been no --

-- didn't the Ninth Circuit narrow

I thought that in the district court,


Lawful permanent residents.

QUESTION:

I thought


And so that was


I had the same question.

It's at 6a


18

of the petition for the appendix.

The court of appeals,


19

in the paragraph at the bottom of 6a, says we stop short


20

of affirming the holding that it's facially


21

unconstitutional.


22

QUESTION:

Right.


23

QUESTION:

We affirm the grant of habeas corpus


24

on the ground the statute is unconstitutional as applied


25

to him in his status as a lawful permanent resident of the


9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

United States. 

MR. OLSON:

2

Yes, and the Ninth Circuit -- the


3

Ninth Circuit did say that both on page 6 -- 6a and -- and


4

on page 30a.

5

issue a broad, sweeping declaration of unconstitutionality


6

of the statute with respect to a broad class of


7

individuals, that is to say, all lawful permanent


8

residents.

9

to unconstitutionality as to a broad spectrum of the


10

But what -- what the Ninth Circuit did was


That's the equivalent of a facial decision as


people covered.

And -- and --


QUESTION:

11

So it's your position, in effect,


12

that although the Ninth Circuit said it was an applied


13

challenge, in fact the Ninth Circuit itself struck it


14

facially.


15

MR. OLSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

what it did.

19
20
21

O'Connor.

It just narrowed the description of


Is that right?


MR. OLSON:

18

Yes, Justice --


That's -- that is correct, Justice


That's --

QUESTION:

But it -- but it struck it facially


only with respect to the permanent resident aliens.


22

MR. OLSON:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. OLSON:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.

To permanent resident aliens.

That's correct.

Sort of half-facial. 


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

(Laughter.) 


2

MR. OLSON:

Mostly facial.


3

QUESTION:

Mostly facial. 


4

(Laughter.) 


5

MR. OLSON:

That's -- that is what the Ninth


6

Circuit did, and it's our position that this -- this case


7

must be considered under those circumstances as a facial


8

challenge.


9

As I was saying, the Court has repeatedly said


10

that in connection with immigration and protecting the


11

Nation's borders, there is no power at which there is more


12

deference to congressional judgment, no authority under


13

the Constitution granted more to the political branches,


14

particularly to Congress.

15

this Court has said, applicable to aliens that would be

16

unacceptable if applied to citizens. 


17

QUESTION:

Congress regularly makes rules,


Is there a regulation or -- or is


18

there a policy with -- in the Department of Justice or the


19

INS which says that there has to be a conviction before


20

you utilize this section?

21

has information that a felony has been committed, is that


22

sufficient to detain?


23

MR. OLSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. OLSON:

Or if the Attorney General just


Well, the statute --

Here there was a conviction.

Here there was a conviction, and


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that is specifically what is said in the statute itself. 


2

It's my understanding --


3
4
5

QUESTION:

Well, the statute itself talks about


a conviction. 

MR. OLSON:

Absolutely.

And -- and what happens


6

in practice, Justice Kennedy, is that either the removal


7

proceeding is brought, as Congress has suggested, if


8

possible, during the period of incarceration of the


9

individual, or immediately upon release from


10
11

incarceration.

So we were talking, to summarize, a -- this --


12

this provision under 1226(c) applies only to the period of


13

the removal proceeding itself, which was carefully


14

distinguished by this Court in its Zadvydas decision of


15

2 years ago. 
 This is on -- compared to that Zadvydas

16

decision, not an unlimited, potentially permanent


17

detention period, what, as the Court suggested in -- in a


18

distinguishable situation a number of years -- years ago


19

in the Carlson case involving members of the Communist


20

Party, a temporary, limited detention for the purpose of


21

keeping the individual in custody, an individual who's had


22

a full panoply of due process, having been convicted


23

beyond a reasonable doubt with full due process of --


24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, but General, it is true, is it


not, that there are people in the class who might have


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been convicted even before the statute was passed.

2

you're not just -- just continuing detention.

3

go out and find them and -- and put them under detention.


4

MR. OLSON:

So


You have to


It's my understanding, Justice


5

Stevens, that it applies to convictions after the statute


6

was passed.

7

I'll try to correct that during -- during rebuttal.

8

that to the vast -- that would all -- to the extent that


9

that might be true and I might be mistaken, that would


I may be misunderstanding that, and if so,

But


10

only illustrate why this is a facial challenge.

11

statute itself should not be declared unconstitutional,


12

particularly in connection with individuals convicted


13

afterwards. 


14
15
16
17
18

QUESTION:

The


What -- what about this particular


individual? 

MR. OLSON:

This was after the statute was


passed, Mr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION:

General Olson, you've -- you've put


19

in statistics about the number of -- of aliens who don't


20

show up for the hearings and the -- the rather low


21

percentage of those who are ultimately deported from the


22

class that don't show up and so on. 


23

On your view of the Government's authority


24

over -- over aliens and the deference that the Court owes,


25

would our -- in your judgment should our decision be the


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

same regardless of those statistics?

2

nothing about the -- the probabilities of catching people,


3

should we, on your view, or would we, on your view, be


4

obligated to defer and simply say it's up to the


5

Government? 


6

MR. OLSON:

If you had told us


Well, I think Justice Souter, the


7

answer to that is that the test that the Court has


8

consistently applied in this area is there -- is there a


9

rational basis, is the congressional objective rationally


10

likely to advance a legitimate governmental purpose. 


11

Those statistics that we set forth in our brief and which


12

were before Congress when Congress enacted this statute,


13

provide the purpose for which Congress acted.


14

QUESTION:

Well -- well, is that rational basis


15

review the one we would employ in reviewing legislation

16

passed by Congress concerning immigration policy?

17

have we applied a more circumscribed review over the means


18

of effectuating those policies?

19

questions?

20

and to say what it does versus the implementation of it.


21
22

Are -- are there separate


I mean, the power of Congress to pass the law


MR. OLSON:

Well, under certain circumstances,


the Court has used that language. 


23

QUESTION:

24

MR. OLSON:

25

And


Right. 

The -- the means to achieve the


objective --


14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. OLSON:

3

Yes. 

-- will be looked at possibly


separately.


4

QUESTION:

5

MR. OLSON:

Yes. 

But it seems to me -- and it seems


6

obvious particularly in this case -- that the means are


7

wrapped up in the objective itself.

What -- it is clear Congress is dealing with a


8
9

very difficult problem of a certain category or groups of


10

aliens that were committing serious crimes in this


11

country.

QUESTION:

12

Well, does -- is -- does that -- do


13

your statistics define that category as the -- the legal


14

permanent resident aliens or all aliens?

15

latter. 

MR. OLSON:

16
17
18

I think it's the


Well, it is -- yes, Justice Souter,


it's all.

QUESTION:

But if it -- if it is the latter,


19

then I don't know that the statistics tell us anything one


20

way or the other about the legitimacy of the ends, i.e.,


21

the -- the automatic detention, with -- with respect to


22

the class that we've got under consideration here. 


23

MR. OLSON:

What the statistics tell us is that


24

there were large numbers of aliens committing serious


25

crimes and that those -- those individuals committing


15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those crimes were highly likely to be recidivists and that


2

they were -- that class of individuals or those groups of


3

individuals were cultivating a criminal class that was


4

engaging in organized --

QUESTION:

5

But, General Olson, those statistics


6

go to the likelihood of entry of the order of deportation,


7

not of the likelihood of flight which this statute is


8

directed at. 


9

MR. OLSON:

10

QUESTION:

Well --

As I understand the statistics --


11

correct me if I'm wrong -- that as to the likelihood of


12

showing up at the hearing itself, which this statute


13

protects, 80 percent of the people do show up.


14

MR. OLSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. OLSON:

Well, 80 percent --

Is that correct? 

Well, the -- the statistics have to


17

be looked at very carefully because that 20 percent --


18

20 percent of the --

QUESTION:

19
20

Eight out of 10 of these criminals


show up. 

Well, no. 


21

MR. OLSON:

22

QUESTION:

23

(Laughter.)


24

MR. OLSON:

25

That's very comforting. 


In that -- that -- well, actually


the -- it's -- it's worse than that, Justice Scalia,


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because that figure of 20 percent who absconded were


2

people that had been, during this period of time, been


3

given individualized hearings.

4

after a hearing, the authorities thought were probably


5

likely not to flee and 20 percent of that group did.

6

you look at --

QUESTION:

7
8

They were the ones that,


When


But -- but they include all aliens


and not just the -- the permanent resident aliens.

MR. OLSON:

9

Yes, Justice Souter, but there's no


10

question that there were large numbers of lawful permanent


11

resident aliens that were evading the deportation


12

proceeding itself.
QUESTION:

13
14
15

Once the deportation --

Well, I presume there was some,


but --

QUESTION: 
 Yes, but, General Olson, I wish you

16

would answer this question.

17

understand the -- the Government's position on it.

18

focusing on the percentage who show up for the hearing. 


19

Am I -- and that's correct.

20

directed at.

21

aliens in the class did show up for the hearing without


22

being detained?


23

It's very important to

We're


That's what this statute is


And am I not correct that 80 percent of the


MR. OLSON:

No.

The figure jumped to 40 percent


24

for people who were never detained at all, Justice


25

Stevens, and that's explained in the brief.

The


17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

20 percent to which you're referring are people to which


2

an individualized hearing was -- was given.

3

alone, we're talking about 11,000 aliens, criminal aliens,


4

who had absconded.

5

showing up for the hearing because if that alien isn't in


6

custody, he won't -- and -- and the figure jumps to


7

90 percent of people that will escape the deportation


8

order itself if there --

QUESTION:

9

In 1992


And we're not talking just about


But the statute doesn't -- the


10

statute is not directed at the consequences after the


11

deportation order has been entered.

12

that? 


13

MR. OLSON:

Am I not right on


I -- I respectfully disagree in this


14

sense, that if you have the alien in custody during the --


15

the removal period itself, he will be in custody at the

16

time the order is issued.


17

QUESTION:

18

MR. OLSON:

19
20
21
22

Oh, I'm sure.

If he's not, it's very difficult for


the Government --

QUESTION:

But if he's at the hearing, at the


conclusion of the hearing, you say, lock this guy up.

MR. OLSON:

Well, that -- that is not the way


23

the process works, Justice Stevens.

24

appeal that the individual can take --


25

QUESTION:

There is a potential


No, but this statute is not directed


18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

at the time during potential appeal.

2

the -- as I understand it -- now, you correct me if I'm


3

wrong.


4

MR. OLSON:

5

QUESTION:

6

It's directed at


No.

As I understand the statute, it's


directed at the time before the hearing starts.

MR. OLSON:

7
8

and the Congress --


9

QUESTION:

Yes, it is, and the Government --


So why can't the immigration judge at


10

the end of the hearing say, A, you're going to be removed,


11

and B, you -- you go in the clink until your -- you go


12

away?

MR. OLSON:

13

Well, but this -- let me answer it


14

this way.

That 20 to 40 percent -- and the statistics are


15

difficult in this area. 
 There are such large numbers of

serious problem.

QUESTION:

I grant that --


24

QUESTION:

But, General Olson, you don't


25

necessarily lose them.

All you're being asked to do is to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

have an individualized hearing as to each member of that


2

20 percent. 

MR. OLSON:

3

But that 20 percent, Justice


4

Stevens -- and it's explained in the brief.

5

20 percent were the individuals for which there had been

an individualized hearing given during that period of time


7

when that process was taking place.

higher.

QUESTION:

15

couldn't you have a tough standard but, nonetheless --

hearing to the person who's willing to come in and he'd


18

have to show, you know, he's not going to run away, he's

not a danger, and he has a good issue on the merits?

that Congress had is that it had experimented with that

MR. OLSON:

Well, it -- it appeared -- it


2

appeared to Congress and it appeared to the immigration


3

authorities to be a reasonably tough standard.

The problem with criminal aliens is that once --


4
5

once they enter this process, once they've been convicted


6

after due process of having committed a serious crime and


7

once they're in that process, which is virtually certain


8

to lead to removal -- I mean, this is -- removal is


9

automatic --

QUESTION:

10

What I -- what I'm worried -- I see


11

that, and what I'm worried about on the other side of


12

it -- I'm -- I can see also how you could limit it like to

bail pending appeal, a tough standard.

14

it is the alien who's there and who's the wrong person or

crime that they say he committed which he didn't.

there could --

Pardon me?

I thought those points can be


I thought he can get a hearing as to those

MR. OLSON:

That's -- that's correct, Justice --


25

QUESTION:

We're only talking about people as to


21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whom it's acknowledged that they committed the crime, it's


2

acknowledged that they're deportable.

3

they may not get deported is the Attorney General might


4

exercise discretion to let them into the country.


5

MR. OLSON:

6

QUESTION:

And the only reason


That's -- that's precisely correct.

That is correct.

So if, in fact, I


7

have a good claim, I'm let out on bail while they're


8

considering it?

MR. OLSON:

10

If -- no.

If you have a -- if you

MR. OLSON:

You can take it to court.

13

26 and 27 of the Government's brief sets forth the -- the

regulations of the -- of the Immigration and

Naturalization Service that provide that you may have an

crime --

20
21

QUESTION:

If you have a claim, you're let out


on bail while they consider the claim?

MR. OLSON:

It's my understanding that what


22

happens is that there's an immediate, or a relatively


23

prompt individualized hearing.

24

answer to that question, but there is the hearing that the


25

Ninth Circuit talked about --

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

-- an individualized hearing,

which -- which would have applied all the way across the

board --


5

QUESTION:

MR. OLSON:

7

-- in those cases under those


regulations. 

QUESTION:

8
9

Well, given --


Given that, General Olson, that we're


only talking about people who have acknowledged -- you


10

know, who have no claim that they didn't commit the crime,


11

who have no claim that they are not deportable, why do we


12

have to rely upon whether 80 percent of them will flee or


13

90 percent, or even -- you know, or none of them will


14

flee?

15

unreasonable to say, look, somebody who has no right to be

16

at large in this country -- he's here illegally, has no


17

right to be at large.

18

he's already committed a crime in this country.

19

leave the country, and we're going to hold him in custody


20

until he leaves.

departure, that's fine, but he will be in custody until he


22

departs.

Why is it -- does the Government concede that it's


And besides that, on top of that,

He should


If he wants to fight that -- that


What is -- what is wrong with that?

MR. OLSON:

Well, we're -- I'm not quarrelling


with your characterization of what --

QUESTION:

No, but you're -- you're fighting it

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

on the -- on the ground that somehow we have to prove --


2

MR. OLSON:

3

QUESTION:

4

No.

No, Justice --


-- that a large number of them will


flee.


5

MR. OLSON:

6

QUESTION:

No.

I'm simply --


It seems to me that even if none of


7

them would flee, if they have no right to be here, if


8

they've committed a crime, why cannot -- they cannot be


9

held in -- in custody until they leave?


10

MR. OLSON:

This -- we may well be here on


11

another occasion defending a broader policy.

12

emphasize the facts that distinguish what you're


13

suggesting and what the Court considered in the Zadvydas


14

case, an immense difference that exists between the


15

circumstances here, and the circumstances under those

16

circumstances. 


17

QUESTION:

But let me


Before you get to -- to Zadvydas and


18

the distinction, you -- you make, I take it, no


19

distinction between lawful permanent residents and people


20

who are excludable.

21

residents have many rights in common with citizens. 


22

Indeed, this Court once said that they were a suspect


23

classification.

24

seems to me you're making no distinction at all.


25

People who are lawful permanent


But as far as this case is concerned, it


MR. OLSON:

The statute makes no distinction.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The Ninth Circuit, of course, did with respect to


2

excludable aliens, said that with that category of aliens,


3

the statute -- even under the Ninth Circuit's reasoning,


4

the statute was constitutional. 

What we -- the statute doesn't make that


5
6

distinction, but what it does do is it provides for a


7

brief, limited detention, which is not unlimited and not


8

potentially permanent, of aliens, an area of Congress'


9

authorities at its zenith, convicted beyond a reasonable


10

doubt with --

QUESTION:

11

But it might be of a crime that


12

they -- one of the claims here is that this is not a


13

qualifying plot -- crime.

14

that may be wrong or right, but suppose -- on your


15

reading, or under this statute, someone would not be able

16

to get bail despite a good claim that they are counting a


17

crime that doesn't qualify as one of these serious


18

offenses.


19

MR. OLSON:

I don't get into that box.

Now


That's the question that I believe I


20

addressed earlier that's referred to, the regulations --


21

and I hope I'm correct -- at pages 26 and 27 of the


22

Government's brief.

23

someone claiming who is claiming that they are a citizen


24

as opposed to an alien, or claiming that the crime for


25

which they've been convicted was not a covered crime,


The -- the regulations provide for

Alderson Reporting Company

1

may -- may have an accelerated hearing, which is -- which


2

is --


3

QUESTION:

In other words, for the class that


4

we're talking about, it's rather artificial to talk about


5

lawful resident aliens because they can get a hearing on


6

whether their continuing residence is lawful.

7

they are determined to be deportable.

8

lawful resident aliens. 


9

MR. OLSON:

10

QUESTION:

They --


They are no longer


That -- that is correct. 

Well, General Olson, aren't they


11

lawful resident aliens until an order is entered that they


12

be deported?


13

MR. OLSON:

What they are is what -- they are --


14

they are lawful resident aliens until there's an order of


15

deportation, but --


16

QUESTION:

All right.

So at the -- at the point


17

of the -- we'll call it the preliminary hearing, the


18

Joseph hearing, when they can bring these challenges,


19

there is no order that they be deported, and they,


20

therefore, have got to be considered, as I understand it,


21

as lawful resident aliens. 


22

MR. OLSON:

They -- however, they have -- they


23

have been convicted after due process of a crime that


24

Congress considers serious, and they're being held for a


25

limited period of time --

Very well, General Olson.


11

Ms. Rabinovitz, we'll hear from you.


12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDY RABINOVITZ


13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


14
15
16

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

The question in this case is whether Congress


17

authorized and, if so, whether the Due Process Clause


18

permits a statute that requires that lawful permanent


19

residents like our client be imprisoned throughout the


20

duration of removal proceedings. 


21

QUESTION:

Ms. Rabinovitz, do you have a


22

response to the jurisdiction problem?

23

possible that despite the Government's failure to raise


24

it, that we could do so.


25

I mean, it's


And why doesn't section 1226 tell the courts to

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

keep hands off?

MS. RABINOVITZ:

2

Yes, Your Honor.

We agree with


3

the Solicitor General's explanation for why this Court did


4

not --

QUESTION:

5
6

it.

I have to tell you I don't understand


I thought maybe you'd enlighten me there. 


7

(Laughter.) 


8

MS. RABINOVITZ:

9

This -- this statute contains


no express language that repeals habeas jurisdiction. 


10

That's one answer that I could give you, Your Honor, and


11

based on this Court's decision in St. Cyr and Calcano,


12

absent that -- that language, the habeas -- there's still


13

jurisdiction in --


14

QUESTION:

How could that language not repeal


15

habeas jurisdiction? 
 No court may set aside any action by

16

the Attorney General under this section.

17

can that -- I mean, what can you do in habeas corpus


18

unless you're setting aside action by the Attorney General


19

under this section?

20

habeas corpus?


How can -- how


How can that possibly not set aside


21

MS. RABINOVITZ:

22

QUESTION:

But this Court has said --


I mean, now, maybe you want to argue


23

it's unconstitutional, but gee, to say that it doesn't do


24

this is -- I mean, it's -- it's incredible.


25

QUESTION:

Well, the Court in St. Cyr, with


28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which both Justice Scalia and I disagreed, said something


2

very much like that, didn't it, that you had to be very


3

specific if you were going to repeal habeas jurisdiction? 


4

MS. RABINOVITZ:

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Yes.


Try Johnson v. Robson too.

The point is that this statute


7

requires the Government to detain individuals like our


8

client who are lawful permanent residents not because


9

their detention is necessary to protect the public from


10

danger of flight risk, but merely because they were


11

convicted in the past for one of a broad range of crimes


12

that the Government believes may render them deportable.

QUESTION:

13
14

believes it.

Can -- you say the Government


The Congress believed it, did it not?


MS. RABINOVITZ: 
 Well, Your Honor, the question

15
16

that remains to be determined in all these cases is


17

whether an individual is, in fact, deportable.

18

did decide that certain kinds of crimes should render an


19

individual deportable and these individuals have been


20

convicted of crimes.

Congress


But the fact --


21

QUESTION:

What more do we need?


22

MS. RABINOVITZ:

The fact that they've been


23

convicted of a crime, Mr. Chief Justice, doesn't mean that


24

it's a crime that renders them deportable under the


25

statute.

And I think that this addresses, in part,


29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Kennedy's question about have they been -- is this


2

just that they're suspected of committing crimes or have


3

they been convicted of crimes. 


4
5

QUESTION:

Well, but in -- in this case, your --


your client was convicted, was he not?


6

MS. RABINOVITZ:

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. RABINOVITZ:

9
10
11
12
13

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --


So --

He was convicted, but there


still is a question about whether his conviction actually

renders him deportable.

QUESTION:

And what question is that?

Does


Congress in the statute set forth the crimes?

MS. RABINOVITZ:

No, Your Honor.

Congress sets


14

forth a -- a broad category of crimes that can render


15

somebody deportable, and one of those is -- is a broad

16

category that are labeled aggravated felonies.


17

The question, though -- and this is a question


18

that has been very hotly litigated in the courts -- is


19

whether a conviction is an aggravated felony.

20

case, that question is especially relevant because in our


21

client's case, the conviction that he was --

We're defending the Ninth


Circuit's ruling, Your Honor.

I'm -- I'm just explaining that this issue about

6

whether somebody is deportable is an open issue, and


7

that's precisely what the -- that's precisely what a


8

deportation proceeding is to determine.

QUESTION:

9

Now, Ms. Rabinovitz, I had -- I had


10

understood from General Olson -- and please, you know, if


11

it's wrong, I -- I want to know it -- that -- that your


12

client could get a hearing on that particular issue,


13

whether the crime he's being -- he has been convicted of


14

is one of the crimes that entails deportation.

15

not true that he can -- that he gets a hearing on that?

16

MS. RABINOVITZ:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Is -- is


He gets a hearing --


Individualized hearing.

He gets a hearing, Your Honor,


19

but it's a very limited hearing to the extent that that


20

hearing does not determine that he has, in fact, been


21

convicted of a crime that renders him deportable.

22

that it --

QUESTION:

23

All


In other words, it's a hearing that


24

says you were convicted of X or you weren't convicted


25

of X.

It's not a hearing that says that X renders you

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

deportable.

Is that the point?


MS. RABINOVITZ:

Yes, although, Your Honor, it


3

does say that the Government is not substantially unlikely


4

to prevail on its charge, so -- that you are deportable. 


5

So -- and essentially it --


6

QUESTION:

So it --


7

MS. RABINOVITZ:

-- it says that there is


8

reason -- there's a possibility.

9

you will be found deportable.

It's not impossible that


You -- that it's not --


10

since the Government is not substantially unlikely to


11

prevail on the charge. 


12

I think it's important to recognize that there


13

are many individuals who are subjected to mandatory


14

detention under this statute who cannot satisfy that


15

standard. 
 In fact, that that -- they've had that hearing

16

and the court has held the Government substantially -- you


17

know, we can't show that the Government is substantially


18

unlikely to prevail. 


19

QUESTION:

I mean, I have a reason.

I am -- I'm confused on this and I'd appreciate it.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

arguments against it are frivolous.

Group 2 are people


2

who have a real non-frivolous argument -- a real non-


3

frivolous argument -- that they aren't -- it's the wrong


4

person, this crime doesn't fall within the statutory


5

definition, I probably will get asylum, something like


6

that.

They have a real non-frivolous argument. 

Now, I thought that what we were talking about,


7
8

at least in part, was that people in this group 2 were


9

being held without bail.

Now, am I right?

Because I


10

think what I heard the Solicitor General say is I'm wrong.

We're only talking about people in group 1.

hearings on whether you are the person that did the --


12

that -- that was convicted and whether the -- the crime of

conviction causes you to be deportable.

hearing on whether, if you are let go, you will show up

for -- for a later hearing.


You want a

QUESTION:

-- so long -- so long as you get a

has no right to be at large in this country, until you

leave.

deportable, is precisely what a deportation hearing is

for, and that kind of decision is not made the first time

protracted process, and we have individuals who have --


6

who have been in jail for 17 months pending an immigration


7

judge hearing to determine that exact question, Justice


8

Scalia, about whether they are, in fact, deportable, which


9

is why we say that the relevant question is whether


It's often a very


10

pending those proceedings, there's a regulatory purpose in

detaining that individual.

12

QUESTION:

And we're not --

of holding them. 
 So that certainly is a regulatory

16

purpose.


17

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is


18

a regulatory purpose.

But this Court looks to the

immigration cases.

MS. RABINOVITZ:

No, Your Honor, Mr. Chief


I respectfully -- I read Carlson differently. 


2

Justice.

3

In Carlson, what this Court did is it upheld the Attorney


4

General's discretionary decision that five individuals


5

could be detained because there was -- that -- the


6

decision to detain them was with not -- was not without


7

reasonable foundation.

8

It's wholly different from this case. 


It was a discretionary decision. 


What makes this statute so unique and so


9
10

unprecedented is that the Government is prohibited. 


11

There's no discretion here.

12

prohibited from releasing individuals like our client, a


13

lawful permanent resident who has a legal right to be


14

here, even when --


The Attorney General is


QUESTION: 
 Well, who has the legal right to be

15
16

here, although he's been convicted of a crime which makes


17

him deportable.

MS. RABINOVITZ:

18

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

It's


19

not clear that this conviction makes him deportable.

20

fact --


21

QUESTION:

22

MS. RABINOVITZ:

In


Well, it's clear he's been convicted.

He's been convicted of a crime,

but it's not clear that this conviction renders him

deportable.

proceeding is for. 


That's precisely what a deportation

Mr. Chief Justice --


Of course, the Seventh -- Seventh


Circuit might have been wrong.

MS. RABINOVITZ:

That's a good point, Your

that case. 


15

And -- and the point that I want to make --

16

QUESTION:

Well, it sounds like you're -- you're


17

still seeking some kind of facial invalidation of the


18

statute rather than as applied to your client.

MS. RABINOVITZ:

19
20

No, Your Honor, we're not


seeking --

21

Because you're relying on a

conviction of someone else for a different kind of a

No.


Are we talking about this person as

Your Honor, this is definitely

-- not entering a car with intent to


commit theft. 

MS. RABINOVITZ:

9

Right, right. 


My point with raising that example was just to


10
11

point out that the question of what constitutes an


12

aggravated felony is very contested.


13

QUESTION:

And isn't it the --

Well, but not in this case.


15

QUESTION:

Not in this case.

MS. RABINOVITZ:

17

Oh, it -- it certainly is.

on the frivolous.

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, I need to --


4

to disagree with you.

5

this is -- is an aggravated felony, the Court is going to


6

need to look at the specific language of the statute. 


7

The -- the specific crime that our client committed was he


8

broke and entered into a tool shed and he was convicted


9

under California State law.

10

technical area of the law.


11

It's unclear.

To decide whether


This is a very complicated,


And all that I can tell you is that if you refer

Excuse me. 


12

to our brief at page 5, note 6 -- oh, no.

13

That's not the place.

14

page 30, note 27, we note numerous examples where the


15

question of whether something is an aggravated felony has

16

been contested and decided --


17

QUESTION:

To our brief at -- our brief at


Do you -- you consider whether he


18

broke into an inhabited tool shed, I guess, to be not


19

within the statute, and the other side thinks it is.


20

MS. RABINOVITZ:

21

QUESTION:

Right.

Right.

Right.


In your opinion, would -- would --


22

and this goes back to my initial question which I'm

still -- haven't heard you really answer.

25

order to get out on -- on appeal -- have bail on appeal,


Look, on

1

he has to show not only he wouldn't run away, not only he


2

isn't a danger, but also that he raises a substantial


3

question.


4

Now, suppose that we were to say at least those


5

people who show that they raise a substantial question --


6

a substantial question -- and it says not for purposes of


7

delay -- that as to those people, you have to have an


8

individualized hearing. 

MS. RABINOVITZ:

9

In this case, if we're talking


10

about somebody who raises a non-frivolous challenge like


11

our client, that would satisfy this case because this


12

is --


13

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not saying if it'd satisfy


14

the case, though I take it from what you say it would


15

satisfy you and your position.


16

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Your Honor, I misspoke.

What I


17

meant is that in this case, this is an as-applied


18

challenge.

19

statute as applied to our client who's a lawful permanent


20

resident, who has bona fide challenges that he is not


21

deportable and is eligible for relief from deportation,


22

that in this case, applying the statute to him is


23

unconstitutional. 


24
25

It's a -- it's a challenge about whether this

Alderson Reporting Company

1

deportation order is not constitutional without an

individualized hearing at least if -- or don't say at


3

least -- if, among other things, he shows there is a

substantial question not for purposes of delay.

an opinion that said that.

6

that opinion? 


7

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Imagine


Would you argue for or against


I would argue for that opinion


8

in this case because it would resolve this case.

9

believe that there also might be -- there would be a


10

constitutional issue that even somebody else -- due


11

process requires that they have an opportunity to show


12

that they're not a danger and a flight risk because that


13

is the purpose of regulatory detention.

14

QUESTION:

I


And as the --


I -- I note that you have redefined

Anything that's

purposes of -- of this new rule?


18

MS. RABINOVITZ:

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Yes, Your Honor --


Wow.

-- and -- and it has to be that


21

way because there are so many examples of circuit courts


22

finding that the board's decision about what constitutes a


23

deportable offense is wrong and yet, that those were cases


24

where the individual could -- where their -- their claim


25

might have been considered bordering on the frivolous,


42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

even though it wasn't.

And let give you a very --

QUESTION:

MS. RABINOVITZ:

5

QUESTION:

That -- that is true but all --

Let me give you an example.


-- all of -- at least for people who


6

have committed their crimes after this statute was


7

enacted, it seems to me that they are on notice.

8

get convicted of a felony, your -- your welcome in this


9

country is at an end if it's an aggravated felony, and you


If you


10

will be held until it is -- it is finally determined


11

whether that is, indeed, an aggravated felony or not. 


12

I don't know that that's terribly unfair.


13
14
15

MS. RABINOVITZ:
the answer.

But your question presupposes


You're saying --


QUESTION:

No, it doesn't. 
 It -- it's just one

16

of the risks you take when you commit a felony.

17

it's -- it's part of -- of the condition of your


18

admittance to this country.

19

any lawful resident alien knows that if he commits a


20

felony and it's an aggravated felony, he will be deported.


21

MS. RABINOVITZ:

22

QUESTION:

Your --


Once this statute is passed,


Two points.


And -- and until the question of


23

whether it is an aggravated felony, assuming it's at least


24

arguable, is decided, he will be held in custody and not


25

permitted to be at large in this country. 


43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

Now, that doesn't strike me as terribly

unreasonable.

Just don't do the felony.


MS. RABINOVITZ:

3

Well, two points, Your Honor. 


4

First, in this case, the conviction that is now being


5

considered as possibly an aggravated felony was committed


6

before the statute took effect.

7

Honor's proposal, the statute could not apply to him.


So even under Your


In terms of what you're suggesting, though, if


8
9

Congress was to say that anybody who -- there still is an


10

issue of whether somebody is, in fact, deportable, and to


11

condition -- and -- and this Court has recognized that


12

individuals who are facing deportation, particularly


13

lawful permanent residents, have a right to a fair


14

hearing.

15

right to physical liberty --


16

QUESTION:

To say that those individuals must give up their


Well, but there's no question that


17

these people are going to get a fair hearing eventually. 


18

The question you're challenging is whether they should


19

be -- be incarcerated pending that hearing.

20

talking about a fair hearing.


21

MS. RABINOVITZ:

So we're not


You're right, Your Honor,


22

Mr. Chief Justice.

But the -- the point is that if


23

somebody is locked up for a year-and-a-half, and they


24

can't get the evidence for their case, because being


25

locked up in jails also makes it much harder for people to


44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

present their cases, there's no right to appointed


2

counsel.

It means they can't work.

There are -- and this is, again, where I would


3
4

like to refer you, just in general, to the amicus brief by


5

the Citizens and Immigrants for Equal Justice which points


6

out other cases where individuals gave up their claims


7

because otherwise they were going to be in detention for


8

so long.


9
10

And let me just point out one other --

QUESTION:

Well, you -- you've got someone who

The alien has committed a felony. 


11

is an alien here.

12

I mean, it's difficult to -- for me to say that they


13

should have all these additional benefits so that somehow


14

they can avoid deportation.


15

MS. RABINOVITZ: 
 Well -- well, first of all,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, this -- it's not only for people who


17

are convicted of felonies.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Even the definition --


Well, but that's with the case we're


dealing of here. 

MS. RABINOVITZ:

Okay, but the -- the question


21

is what -- what constitutes an aggravated felony. 


22

Misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony as well. 


23

You're right.

24
25

In this case, the initial conviction --


QUESTION:

What -- what do you -- what do you


mean, misdemeanors constitute an aggravated felony?


45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. RABINOVITZ:

I know it's somewhat shocking,


2

Mr. Chief Justice, but, in fact, the way that aggravated


3

felony has been defined so broadly --


4

QUESTION:

5

MS. RABINOVITZ:

6
7

Well --

-- the courts have held that


even misdemeanors can be aggravated felonies. 

QUESTION:

But there's no question that first


8

degree burglary is not a misdemeanor.

9

that's not -- we don't have to worry about that, do we?


10

MS. RABINOVITZ:

So, in our case,


But let me return to the point


11

about whether it's -- whether due process is satisfied by


12

requiring that somebody be mandatorily detained throughout


13

the process of their deportation proceeding, a process


14

which, as I said, can be months, often years, without any


15

individualized determination of danger and flight risk.

16

And the example that I wanted to give ties back


17

with this Court's decision in St. Cyr, which said that


18

212(c) relief was available to individuals whose


19

convictions -- who had pled guilty prior to -- to the


20

statute having taken effect.

21

were subject to mandatory detention under the statute. 


22

Their claim would have been considered close to frivolous


23

until the Supreme Court ruled differently. 


24
25

QUESTION:

All of those individuals


Well, that's -- that's -- I mean,


your argument to me rings true for people who have real


46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

claims, but if you're trying to apply it to a person who


2

has an insubstantial claim or a claim that is interposed


3

for purposes of delay, I'm tempted to say, well, there's a


4

very good reason to keep him locked up, namely, he doesn't


5

have any argument and he's about to be deported and -- and


6

if he wants to be deported quickly, he can be. 


7

MS. RABINOVITZ:

8

QUESTION:

9

Your Honor, that's --


But if he has a substantial claim,


it's different. 

MS. RABINOVITZ:

10

Your Honor, I think it's


11

important to recognize that that's precisely the kind of


12

factors that the Immigration Service and the immigration


13

judge looks at when they make a determination whether


14

somebody should be released on bond.

15

determining flight risk, that's precisely what they look

16

at.

17

frivolous claim.

18

on bond because they're not going to show up.

19

not saying that individuals in that situation should be


20

released from detention. 


They -- when they're


They say, oh, this is a frivolous -- this is a

We're not going to release this person

And we're


All that we're saying is that an individual


21
22

needs to be given some opportunity to demonstrate, look,


23

I was convicted of this crime, but I have claims for


24

relief.

25

I'm not a flight risk.
QUESTION:

I'm not a danger.
