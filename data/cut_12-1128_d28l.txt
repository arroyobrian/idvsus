 (1:00 p.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

this afternoon in Case 121128, Medtronic v. Boston 

5

Scientific Corporation. 

6

 Mr. Waxman. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

8
9

11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 Patent law places the burden of proving 

12

infringement on the patentee.  And until this case, it 

13

was settled that the burden does not shift if the issue 

14

arises in a declaratory action seeking a judgment of 

15

noninfringement.  The Federal circuit imposed a 

16

different rule in suits brought under MedImmune where 

17

the party seeking a declaration of noninfringement is a 

18

licensee.  That was error. 

19

 Allocation of the burden of proof inheres in 

20

the governing substantive law, while the Declaratory 

21

Judgment Act is procedural only and does not change 

22

substantive rights.  The burden of proof in MedImmune 

23

actions, like all other declaratory actions, remains 

24

where it would have rested in the equivalent coercive 

25

suit brought by that patentee.

3

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Now, this concerns just the 

2

risk of nonpersuasion.  It doesn't concern the burden of 

3

production; is that right? 

4

 MR. WAXMAN: 

That's correct.  That's 

5

that's the issue in this case.  Although as we point 

6

out, that the word "burden of proof"  I think the word 

7

"burden of proof" used in the opinion below could be 

8

thought to be addressed to both points, but the parties 

9

agree that the relevant consideration here is the burden 

10

of proof and that trial judges do retain discretion to 

11

make rules about ordering  the ordering of proof in 

12

patent cases. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if that's all that's 

14

involved, then the case doesn't seem to amount to quite 

15

as much as one might have thought otherwise, does it? 

16

If  suppose the  the patentee has the burden of 

17

production, so they would have to explain why there was 

18

infringement; they would have to introduce proof of 

19

infringement. 

20

 And the only difference is who wins when 

21

the  the factfinder thinks that it is exactly in 

22

equipoise. 

23

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Right.  Well, that, of course, 

24

was not what happened in  not what the Respondent 

25

maintained should happen in this case.  But taking your

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question as it is, this Court has pointed out repeatedly 

2

that the burden of  where the burden of persuasion 

3

rests is very often outcome  outcome determinative. 

4

And that is certainly true in patent cases.  What the 

5

jury is told about who has the burden of persuasion is 

6

surpassingly important in many cases, including many 

7

patent cases. 

8
9

 And that's the issue in this case. 

I mean, 

the substantive  the  the reason why the Federal 

10

circuit erred is clearly doctrinal, which is this Court 

11

has said, over and over again, that burdens of proof, 

12

like standards of proof, are substantive.  They inhere 

13

in the substantive right, and the Court has also said, 

14

repeatedly, that the declaratory judgment action is 

15

procedural only and doesn't change substantive rights. 

16

 But I think if you go to a  to the policy 

17

question, Justice Alito, reversing the burden in a 

18

declaratory action would impair the purpose and utility 

19

of the Declaratory Judgment Act, which was enacted to 

20

provide a mechanism for determining how the equivalent 

21

coercive action would be resolved without the  without 

22

requiring the declaratory judgment plaintiff to subject 

23

itself to retrospective liability. 

24
25

 And, indeed, shifting the burden would 
threaten the issue preclusive effect of the declaratory

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

judgment, frustrated 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It seems to me we 

3

could  all that may be true, but we need to cut down 

4

to the basic issue, which is MedImmune changes all that. 

5

The idea is you're moving along with the license, 

6

everybody's happy.  All of a sudden, you jump into 

7

court.  Why shouldn't you have the burden as the party 

8

who seeks to disturb the status quo? 

9

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, the  the reason, 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, is the reason that the burden of 

11

proof is substantive, and a declaratory judgment action 

12

under the Act is not  is aimed not to change any 

13

substantive rights.  And that's why all of the decided 

14

cases in this area, except for the one below, left the 

15

burden exactly where substantive patent law left it. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Does it help your answer 

17

or  or does it limit the theory of your case too much 

18

to say that, in this case, there is a controversy 

19

satisfying the declaratory judgment rules because the 

20

patentholder gave notice of potential  or of 

21

infringement?  Am I right about that? 

22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

You're right about that, and 

23

that would be true, Justice Kennedy, on all MedImmune 

24

cases. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Now, could we  or should

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we make the case turn on that, or can we say, with 

2

declaratory judgment, there has to be a dispute, we 

3

we know that a dispute is likely, a controversy, so the 

4

formality of a notice is not important. 

5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, I don't know that it's a 

6

formality of a notice.  I mean, the issue that this 

7

Court addressed in MedImmune  the question that you're 

8

raising, I think, is one that goes to Article III 

9

jurisdiction.  You can't use the declaratory judgment 

10

procedure to get the Court to answer a hypothetical 

11

question. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, it goes to me to 

13

a basic question of fairness.  When I picked up this 

14

case, I thought, how is the patentholder supposed to 

15

know what all these new inventions are?  What does it 

16

know about it?  But then I answered my own question by 

17

saying, well, it gave notice of infringement. 

18
19
20

 But  that's why I've asked if the notice 
is essential to your position? 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

I think the notice is the 

21

well, it's essential to the Article III MedImmune 

22

question, whether or not there actually is a case or 

23

controversy. 

24
25

 So, in this case, it's perfectly obvious 
because the  the license requires Medtronic to

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

affirmatively go to Mirowski within 30 days of 

2

introducing any product and not only tell  providing 

3

notice of the product, but providing the manual  the 

4

diagrams and the manuals that are given to physicians so 

5

that Mirowski can determine, within 60 days, whether or 

6

not to assert infringement. 

7

 In MedImmune, you didn't have that 

8

procedure, but the Court still held in the context of 

9

that case that, because Genentech had made clear that it 

10

thought that the Cabilly patent covered the accused 

11

devices, there was sufficient  sufficiently concrete 

12

controversy that MedImmune did not have to stop paying 

13

royalties and breach the license. 

14

 And  and so, therefore  I think I may be 

15

talking around your question, but I am trying to get to 

16

the point that the  the requirement of some notice, 

17

the  the patentee  there's no declaratory judgment 

18

jurisdiction if the patentee doesn't know about the 

19

product, has  has never done anything to suggest that 

20

the product  that his or her patent reads on the 

21

product. 

22

 But that is an Article III question that 

23

would be  you wouldn't get to the burden of proof if 

24

you couldn't satisfy MedImmune. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Waxman, what do you

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

make of the  the patent listing noninfringement as an 

2

affirmative defense in an infringement suit? 

3

 MR. WAXMAN: 

We agree with the articulation 

4

of the point by the Solicitor General in the United 

5

States brief, which is that the cases have recognized 

6

that noninfringement can either be a general defense 

7

that is, when  when noninfringement is simply a 

8

general denial of a cause of  of a claim of 

9

infringement, it is not an affirmative defense. 

10

 But there are particular types of 

11

noninfringement claims.  And the ones that I'm familiar 

12

with are prosecution history estoppel and the 

13

experimental use exception that are affirmative 

14

defenses. 

15

 In other words, those are situations in 

16

which the alleged infringer says, hey, I'm not saying 

17

that your patent doesn't read  all the claims of your 

18

patent don't read on my invention; I'm claiming 

19

noninfringement because I was making experimental use, 

20

and that has affirmatively been determined by Congress 

21

not to infringe. 

22

 Or, yes, your  the elements of your claim 

23

read upon my invention, but during the prosecution of 

24

the patent in the Patent Office, you disclaimed some 

25

claim scope, and under prosecution history estoppel,

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 this Court elucidated in Festow, there is no 

2

 infringement. 

3

 This is a case involving a general denial of 

4

 infringement, and therefore, it is not an affirmative 

5

 defense. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What you  what you just 

7

 responded, that would go as well for an alleged 

8

 infringer who is not a licensee, right? 

9

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Yes.  I mean  absolutely.  I 

10

 mean, the point here 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

This here  this case is 

12

 about the difference between the licensee and the 

13

 nonlicensee. 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Right.  So a defense of 

15

 noninfringement  a general defense of 

16

 noninfringement is not an affirmative defense.  And in 

17

 the  the potential or correlative coercive action 

18

 which would have been a suit for patent infringement by 

19

 Mirowski, had we ceased making the royalty payments, 

20

 they would have borne the burden of proving 

21

 infringement, unless we raised an affirmative defense, 

22

 like prosecution history estoppel or experimental use, in which case we 

23

would have the burden. 

24
25

 The point of the Declaratory Judgment Act is 
 that the burden is left exactly where it would have

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 been, had there been no  had this identical issue 

2

 arisen in the absence of the declaratory judgment 

3

 procedure. 

4

 And in this respect, it is identical to the 

5

 jury trial right, which this Court held in Beacon 

6

 Theatres v. Westover, is also an element of the 

7

 substantive claim and also cannot be deprived by the 

8

 peculiarity of a declaratory judgment being a claim for 

9

 an equitable remedy. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Waxman, as I understand 

11

 it, the agreement in this case identified certain 

12

 patents and contemplated that there would be disputes 

13

 about whether particular products of Medtronic violated 

14

 or infringed or practiced, whatever, those patents. 

15
16

 But there might be some other kinds of 
 agreements which, instead, identify certain products 

17

 MR. WAXMAN: 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mmhmm. 
 and essentially treat 

19

 those as infringing products in the absence of a 

20

 license.  In that sort of agreement, would you make the 

21

 same kind of claim, that if Medtronic had that agreement 

22

 that identified certain products, but Medtronic woke up 

23

 one day and said, you know what, we don't think that 

24

 those products infringe, we essentially want to 

25

 relitigate our agreement, can Medtronic come to court

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 and do that via a declaratory judgment action? 

2
3

 And if so, who would bear the burden of 
 proof? 

4

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So if I understand your 

5

 question, first, to  to go to the license in this 

6

 case.  This case not only involves products that 

7

 didn't  that aren't specifically articulated in a 

8

 license agreement; neither the patents nor the products 

9

 at issue in this case had even been conceived, much less 

10

 in existence, at the time the license agreement was in 

11

 effect. 

12

 But in  if I understand your question, in 

13

 a situation in which I make Widget A and you claim that 

14

 you have the patent that reads on that widget, and I 

15

 you agree to license me to do it, if the license  if 

16

 payment of the license depends upon a determination that 

17

 it otherwise would be infringing, I can file a 

18

 declaratory judgment action and seek a declaration that 

19

 it's not infringing. 

20

 That is, if the cover  if the license 

21

 covers only products that otherwise would infringe, I 

22

 can bring a DEC action, claiming noninfringement, and 

23

 you would bear the burden, assuming that you had 

24

 threatened, in some way, to enforce your patent against 

25

 me.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 In  in the  the situation that  sort 

2

 of bogeyman situation that Mirowski and the  the 

3

 intellectual property owner's brief articulate, which 

4

 imagine, which is you license  I have a  I have a 

5

 product, you have a patent, you license it to me, and I 

6

 turn around the next day and sue for  a declaration of 

7

 noninfringement, there are any number of ways that you, 

8

 as the patentee, could protect yourself from that 

9

 extraordinary eventuality. 

10

 You could provide, for example, that  I 

11

 you would require me to issue a  you know, to  to 

12

 to pay a paidup royalty for all use.  Or you could 

13

 simply say, we don't care whether the patent infringes 

14

 or not; you agree to pay me three dollars per unit sold. 

15

 Or you could put a provision in that would say, if you 

16

 sue for patent infringement, the royalty rate goes to 

17

 3X. 

18

 Or, for that matter, if you sue, that 

19

 will  that can  I can deem that a breach of the 

20

 license agreement and  and recover the  the remedies 

21

 that patent law allows, an injunction and treble damages 

22

 and attorneys' fees in the context of a  a willful 

23

 action. 

24

 I want to underscore, although the Federal 

25

 circuit made a broad rule, exactly what we have here.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 In this case, Mirowski  this license is from 1991. 

2

 Mirowski  it's not in the record, but there's no 

3

 dispute that Mirowski has received hundreds of millions 

4

 of dollars of royalties from Medtronic for its patents. 

5

 It gets, as a benefit of this license 

6

 notice, as I said, within 30 days of every new product 

7

 and the manual, and it can require Medtronic to start 

8

 accruing royalties and an interest rate of 2  of 2 

9

 points over prime, as soon as it sends us a notice. 

10

 And moreover, in the  in the litigation 

11

 tolling agreement, we agree that, even though we are not 

12

 a party in the referenced St. Jude action, we would be 

13

 bound by any determination in that adjudication, 

14

 whereas, otherwise, we wouldn't. 

15

 So this license agreement was enormously 

16

 beneficial and couldn't be farther from the scenario of 

17

 I have a widget, I agree to license it, and the next 

18

 day, I turn around and sue you.  But, in that event, 

19

 there would be lots and lots of remedies. 

20

 I do want to underscore one other thing, 

21

 that the Federal circuit said that it was applying this 

22

 special rule only in MedImmunetype cases.  But the 

23

 rationale of the court is that what causes the burden to 

24

 shift is the absence of a counterclaim for infringement. 

25

 That would have, for example, caused the

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 burden to shift in the Myriad case that this Court 

2

 decided last term, where there was one researcher at NYU 

3

 who had standing to bring a declaratory judgment action. 

4

 There was no basis for Myriad to claim 

5

 infringement because he had made clear that he 

6

 wouldn't  he wouldn't engage in the research and 

7

 clinical work that he was going to, so long as he was in 

8

 risk of patent infringement remedies.  And that  the 

9

 source of the rule  the source of the law where the 

10

 burden of proof lies, is in substantive patent law.  And 

11

 this Court has said, for 125 years, that it rests with 

12

 the infringer. 

13

 What neither the Federal circuit nor my 

14

 friend on the other side of this case has ever 

15

 identified is what is the source of the rule that shifts 

16

 the burden in a declaratory judgment action?  It can't 

17

 be the Declaratory Judgment Act because that Act is 

18

 procedural only. 

19

 If I can reserve the balance of my time?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON, 

23

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

24
25

Thank you, counsel. 

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 
 MR. GANNON: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 please the Court: 

2

 The government agrees that using the same 

3

 burden of proof that would apply in the hypothetical 

4

 coercive action that underlies the Declaratory Judgment 

5

 Act is the best thing to do in this mirror image 

6

 declaratory judgment action.  That best serves the 

7

 purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act and allows for 

8

 final resolution of the types of controversies that this 

9

 Court contemplated in MedImmune. 

10

 If I could turn to Justice Kagan's points 

11

 about an incident in which the parties had actually 

12

 agreed to  whether certain products were covered by a 

13

 particular license. 

14

 That would be different from the situation 

15

 we have here because the products in question here 

16

 weren't actually in existence at the time of the 

17

 underlying license agreement.  The whole point of that 

18

 aspect of the license agreement was to, as you said, 

19

 channel future disputes into this particular dispute 

20

 resolution mechanism. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Are  are you 

22

 suggesting that the burdenshifting rule should be 

23

 different in the hypothetical Justice Kagan 

24
25

 MR. GANNON: 

I was not about to suggest 

 that, Justice Sotomayor.  I was going to say that I

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 think that's the  that  that that would probably be 

2

 the least logical way to deal with the quandary that 

3

 might arise from thinking that somebody is then trying 

4

 to breach the license. 

5

 And we don't think there's any license 

6

 breach here because there wasn't any prior agreement on 

7

 the fact that these future products were going to be 

8

 covered by the  by these patents, that they'd be 

9

 practicing these patents. 

10

 But, even if there were some concern about 

11

 the licensee turning around and challenging the 

12

 agreement that it had previously made, it seems like the 

13

 problem there is either that they should be estopped by 

14

 what they already said in the agreement or Lear needs to 

15

 be extended to keep them from being estopped in that 

16

 way.  But shifting the burden of proof seems like an odd 

17

 way to get at solving whatever the quandary there might 

18

 be. 

19

 And I think that, at some point, this 

20

 this also interweaves with a point that the Chief 

21

 Justice made, about whether Medtronic here is seeking to 

22

 change the status quo.  And we don't think that 

23

 Medtronic is seeking to change the status quo here, for 

24

 a couple different reasons. 

25

 One of them is, as I was just saying, that

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the agreement here didn't actually reach  the license 

2

 agreement here didn't  it didn't include a meeting of 

3

 the minds about whether these particular future products 

4

 would be covered by these patents, including one of the 

5

 patents was reissued after the time of the license. 

6

 And also, this license agreement expressly 

7

 preserved the parties' ability, including Medtronic's 

8

 ability, to challenge both the validity and the 

9

 enforceability of the patent.  That's at page 13 of the 

10

 Joint Appendix.  And so there's no way in which I think 

11

 it can be legitimately said that Medtronic is trying to 

12

 either get out of its contractual obligations or to 

13

 change the status quo. 

14

 The status quo, right now, is that the 

15

 royalties are collecting in a certified account, and so, 

16

 in a sense, both parties are trying to change the status 

17

 quo, in trying to get the stream of royalties that 

18

 either is applicable to these products or isn't, on the 

19

 basis of the resolution of a question that the parties 

20

 had not decided, but said would be decided in a 

21

 declaratory judgment action like this. 

22

 And we think that the best way to think of a 

23

 declaratory judgment action like this is that it is the 

24

 mirror image of the underlying coercive hypothetical 

25

 action that could have been brought against Medtronic.

18

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well  well, but I 

2

 guess the argument is that it's the mirror image of an 

3

 action that could not have been brought because 

4

 Medtronic is paying royalties. 

5

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, the same thing is true in 

6

 MedImmune, and I think that the Court noted that the 

7

 in MedImmune, that the Declaratory Judgment Act was 

8

 intended to help get the party out of the dilemma it 

9

 would be in, in deciding whether it should continue to 

10

 be effectively coerced into paying royalties that it 

11

 thinks it doesn't need to pay or exposing itself to the 

12

 risks associated with  with breaching the license 

13

 and  and being subject to treble damages, attorneys' 

14

 fees, and the other remedies that would be available 

15

 under the Patent Act. 

16

 And, yet, even though there had been no 

17

 infringement in that case and no breach of the contract 

18

 in that case, which is also true here, because, so far, 

19

 everybody has been behaving the way the license expected 

20

 them to behave, the Court recognized that the parties 

21

 had a concrete dispute about the applicability of the 

22

 patents to those particular products, that the scope of 

23

 the contract was not going to require payment of 

24

 royalties where the patent did not apply, and said that 

25

 the  the issues that were going to be resolved in the

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 declaratory judgment action there were going to involve 

2

 questions of patent validity, patent enforceability, and 

3

 scope of coverage, patent infringement, which is exactly 

4

 what we have here. 

5

 Medtronic has raised in their complaint 

6

 the wellpleaded complaint that you would look to here, 

7

 is one that arises under the Patent Act and includes 

8

 claims involving all three of those issues, just as was 

9

 the case in MedImmune. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I take it you disagree 

11

 with the  we have one friend of the Court brief that 

12

 says this is not a case arising under the patent law; it 

13

 arises under contract law.  It's a contract case with a 

14

 patent issue. 

15

 MR. GANNON: 

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do 

16

 disagree with that.  We think that this case involves a 

17

 claim that arises under the patent laws, for the reasons 

18

 that I was just saying. 

19

 I think that the way to  the way to 

20

 conceptualize this is to look to what the wellpleaded 

21

 complaint would be in the hypothetical coercive action 

22

 that would be being brought against Medtronic if we 

23

 didn't have the problem presented by the fact that they 

24

 haven't actually breached the contract or infringed at 

25

 this point.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And we have every reason to think that that 

2

 hypothetical coercive action is one that arises under 

3

 the patent laws because it's one involving infringement. 

4

 That's the dispute that the parties acknowledge that 

5

 they have. 

6

 In the litigation tolling agreement at page 

7

 20 of the Joint Appendix, it talks about the fact that 

8

 the parties have a dispute under Section 271 of the 

9

 Patent Act.  In the red brief here, Mirowski has  has 

10

 told us on page 48 that, if Medtronic were to cease 

11

 paying royalties, that the recourse would be that they 

12

 would bring an infringement suit.  And the complaint 

13

 here in paragraph 5 alleges that the claim here arises 

14

 under the Patent Act. 

15

 And because it does arise under the Patent 

16

 Act and because it's clear here that all of the 

17

 defensive issues would also be Federal, as I mentioned 

18

 before, I think there is no dispute here that this 

19

 this would arise under the patent laws, which would 

20

 provide for district court jurisdiction under Section 

21

 1338 and exclusive appellate jurisdiction in the Federal 

22

 circuit under Section 1295(a), even before the 

23

 amendments in the America Invents Act in 2011. 

24
25

 I think that there is one other point that 
 would be worth making in response to some of the amicus

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 briefs about the  the potential problems here 

2

 associated with whether the parties have an incentive to 

3

 enter into these type of licensing arrangements. 

4

 As Mr. Waxman already explained, the 

5

 patentholder here got lots of benefits out of  out of 

6

 entering into an agreement like this, notwithstanding 

7

 the fact that they would leave themselves open to 

8

 precisely the suits that the agreement contemplated, 

9

 which was a suit involving both infringement and 

10

 validity questions; and that, under the circumstances, 

11

 there's  they had plenty of incentive to enter into a 

12

 license agreement, notwithstanding the fact that they 

13

 would continue to bear the same burden of proof that 

14

 they would bear in every other procedural context in 

15

 which patent infringement claims have arisen up until 

16

 now. 

17

 And so I think that, in that sense, 

18

 that's  that's not a sea change from their 

19

 perspective.  And  and, yet, even if they were to 

20

 think it so, as Mr. Waxman explained, a licensor in that 

21

 context would have several mechanisms that they could 

22

 use in order to rejigger the balance between the parties 

23

 if they wanted to. 

24
25

 And  and I think that we agree with 
 with everything on the list that Mr. Waxman mentioned,

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 including having fully paidup licenses or allowing a 

2

 suit for infringement or invalidity to constitute a 

3

 termination of the license that would allow the 

4

 patentholder to bring an infringement action. 

5
6

 If there are no further questions, we would 
 urge the Court to reverse.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Neustadt.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR I. NEUSTADT 

10
11
12
13

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Thank you, Your Honor. 

 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 The Federal circuit got it right in this 

14

 case.  The Federal circuit took the wellsettled law on 

15

 burden of proof, and it applied it to two stipulated 

16

 facts and reached a conclusion that it had to reach.  It 

17

 was controlled by it. 

18

 The two stipulated facts were, number one, 

19

 when Mirowski's counsel, me, wrote letters to Medtronic, 

20

 that was not a notice of infringement.  There could be 

21

 no infringement in this case.  Infringement is defined 

22

 as "using a patented invention without authority." 

23

 Medtronic had authority.  It was licensed. 

24

 The second stipulated fact  and this is at 

25

 page 51 of the Joint Appendix  is that Medtronic is a

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 licensee.  It cannot be an infringer.  So everything 

2

 that you say about infringement involves a completely 

3

 different situation. 

4

 There was no shifting of the burden of 

5

 proof.  The wellsettled law that I referred to is the 

6

 normal default rule.  The normal default rule is perhaps 

7

 one of the most fundamental tenets of our jurisprudence. 

8

 It says that, if a party files a complaint and seeks 

9

 relief, it has the responsibility to prove that it is 

10
11

 entitled to that relief. 
 And the normal default rule has the word 

12

 "default" in there because it refers to the fact that 

13

 the statute doesn't decide the burden of proof.  And 

14

 there's no dispute in this case that the statute does 

15

 not decide the burden of proof. 

16

 So 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but you could say 

18

 that about any declaratory judgment action.  You can say 

19

 the person bringing the declaratory judgment action is 

20

 seeking the relief.  And if  if we follow what you 

21

 said, that then the burden shifts in every declaratory 

22

 judgment action.  And it clearly doesn't. 

23

 I mean, we  we've said, time and again, 

24

 that the burden of proof normally does not shift. 

25

 What's different here?

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

I'll tell you what's 

2

 different here.  The difference is that there is no 

3

 infringement.  Medtronic is a licensee.  As a result, 

4

 there can be no coercive counterclaim.  As the Chief 

5

 Justice noted, they're paying royalties.  There is no 

6

 infringement. 

7
8
9
10
11
12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How about a permissive 

 counterclaim? 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Pardon me? 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How about a permissive 

 counterclaim? 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

A permissive counterclaim, by 

13

 definition, would have nothing to do with the issue that 

14

 is involved. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But could  could the 

16

 patentholder bring in the declaratory action a 

17

 counterclaim for infringement? 

18

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

No, they cannot because 

19

 Medtronic is a licensee.  They cannot be an infringer. 

20

 And the difference 

21
22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 infringer, Mr. Neustadt, if 

23

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

Well, they can be an 

Pardon me? 
They can be an infringer if 

 they say, we're ignoring our agreement, we're not paying

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 royalties, but we're going to go on and continue making 

2

 the product. 

3

 Then MVF would say they would be infringing. 

4

 And that's the world that MedImmune imagines is 

5

 happening.  It says 

6
7

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

No.  I'm sorry, I interrupted 

 you.  Go ahead. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

10
11

No, I'm finished. 
No, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean 

 to interrupt you. 
 Okay. 

That's not what happened in 

12

 MedImmune.  First, if you change  if you change the 

13

 facts and Medtronic starts infringing because it stops 

14

 paying royalties, of course, you get different results. 

15

 Here's what happened in MedImmune, in our situation

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not sure how you're 

 receiving royalties.  It's in an escrow account. 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Medtronic is holding the 

 money. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, but it's in an 

 escrow account.  You can't touch it, right? 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Well, we do not have access 

 to the money that they're holding, correct. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right.  So how are you 

 getting paid?  Why isn't there a technical infringement?

26

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3
4
5
6

Well, there can't be 
Because you're not 

 receiving the money. 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Because we agreed to that in 

 the agreement.  That's part of our agreement. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, but you're still 

7

 not receiving the money. 

8

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

But we don't  we agreed to 

9

 not receiving the money.  Everyone is operating in 

10

 accordance with the license.  We can't say, you're 

11

 withholding money and not paying it to us. 

12
13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And you agreed they 

 could sue you. 

14

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Pardon me? 
You agreed they could 

16

 sue you under a Declaratory Judgment Act to find out 

17

 whether or not they're infringing, correct? 

18

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20

That's right. 
All right.  So why 

 shouldn't you be bound by that 

21

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry? 
Why shouldn't you be 

23

 bound by that agreement? 

24

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

25

Oh, we are bound by the 

 agreement that 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

To prove that they're 

 infringing. 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

No, they're not infringing. 

4

 It's claim coverage.  Medtronic cannot infringe because 

5

 they're a licensee.  The dispute is over claim coverage. 

6

 It's not infringement.  That's why we cannot have a 

7

 counterclaim for infringement. 

8

 Justice Scalia's question, the big 

9

 difference is that we cannot counterclaim for 

10

 infringement.  Under the normal default rule, where the 

11

 party seeking relief has the burden of proof, you have 

12

 to look at the case, and you have to ask yourself 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I don't  I don't 

14

 understand.  Suppose the licensee says, this isn't 

15

 covered by the agreement at all, we're not going to pay 

16

 you anything.  And it starts to manufacture its 

17

 products.  That's  that's the whole point.  That's 

18

 outside the agreement, they are not going to pay you 

19

 anything. 

20

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

22

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Well, they just 
Or am I missing something? 
Yes, I believe you are.  What 

23

 Medtronic wants in this license is they want an 

24

 insurance policy for their future products.  The problem 

25

 is that they could  if they don't have a license, they

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 can get enjoined.  So they build this insurance policy 

2

 so that they're protected, and then they even have a 

3

 provision whereby they can go and file a DJ action. 

4

 Now, as I was saying, there are two types of 

5

 DJ actions in this circumstance.  One is where the 

6

 accused infringer says, I am not infringing, and I want 

7

 a DJ to that effect.  In that response, where you are 

8

 talking about infringement and not claim coverage, the 

9

 patentee has to counterclaim.  It's compulsory. 

10
11
12

 The patentee then has the burden of proof in 
 that case because he has claimed infringement. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It seems to me it is often 

13

 the case, in declaratory judgment actions, that the 

14

 defendant in the action cannot counterclaim.  I mean, it 

15

 typically occurs when somebody doesn't want to be in 

16

 breach of contract and  and brings a suit to 

17

 see  you know, claiming if I do this I won't be in 

18

 breach. 

19

 The other side can't counterclaim because 

20

 the person hasn't been in breach.  The whole purpose of 

21

 the declaratory judgment statute is to enable you to sue 

22

 before the other side has a cause of action against you. 

23

 That's the whole purpose of it. 

24

 So  so why should the fact that the other 

25

 side doesn't have a counterclaim change anything?

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 That's usually the situation. 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Because, under the normal 

3

 default rule, if only one party is seeking relief, that 

4

 party has the burden of proof.  You get into a more 

5

 complicated situation 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But we are not dealing with 

7

 the normal default rule.  We are dealing with a 

8

 declaratory judgment statute, and we've said, time and 

9

 time again, that it doesn't alter the burden of proof. 

10

 And your response is, well, it does when the other side 

11

 can't counterclaim.  And my response to that is, 

12

 usually, the other side can't counterclaim. 

13

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

The  if you take the normal 

14

 default rule as set forth in Schaffer, which is the case 

15

 we cite, and it's this Court's precedent involving an 

16

 individual education program, and this Court 

17

 specifically states if the parents bring the suit, they 

18

 have the burden of proof because they're seeking relief. 

19

 And if the school district brings a suit, 

20

 they have the burden of proof because they're the ones 

21

 who are seeking relief.  Wherever you have a case where 

22

 only one party is seeking relief, the normal default 

23

 rule is applicable, and the party that seeks relief has 

24

 to prove it. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But that was not  Weast

30

Alderson Reporting Company

 was not  was not a patent infringement case.  It 

2

 wasn't a declaratory  it wasn't a declaratory 

3

 judgment, was it? 

4

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

It wasn't, but that doesn't 

5

 make any difference, because there's no exception for 

6

 declaratory judgment cases in the normal default rule. 

7

 It's based 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, why shouldn't there 

 be? 

10

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm sorry? 
I mean, why shouldn't there 

12

 be?  I take what you're saying is that their claim is, 

13

 look  you called it claim scope or something.  What 

14

 did you call it? 

15

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Claim coverage. 
Claim coverage.  They say, 

17

 we have a product, and it doesn't violate the  the 

18

 patent for the reason that the claims in the patent 

19

 don't cover it. 

20

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Correct. 
Now, you want to call that 

22

 a claim coverage.  I would call it no infringement. 

23

 Call it what you wish.  But the fact is there are  and 

24

 moreover, you couldn't bring a counterclaim because he's 

25

 already agreed that, if he loses his suit, he'll pay you

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the money.  So there's nothing to claim for. 

2

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4

That's correct. 
Yes, I know.  Now, all 

 that's true. 

5

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
But, nonetheless, the fact 

7

 is in many claims  in many instances, though perhaps 

8

 not yours, this kind of claim, i.e., that person's 

9

 patent does not cover my product 

10

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
 is actually a way of 

12

 saying whether your product infringes the patent, one 

13

 way of saying that.  So their point is, call it what you 

14

 wish, but where you have a claim which amounts to a 

15

 claim that my product does not infringe his patent, the 

16

 rule that should apply is the person who owns the patent 

17

 should have to prove that the claims do cover the 

18

 product. 

19

 And there are a lot of good reasons, et 

20

 cetera, that they put in their brief why that should be 

21

 so.  It's easiest for the patentee to know in what 

22

 respect it violates the claim.  Normally, a patent, 

23

 being a monopoly, should not have too many advantages 

24

 beyond the scope of the monopoly. 

25

 And we don't like false patents because

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that  you'd have different results in the same kind of 

2

 patent with different people depending upon whether, in 

3

 some other instance, your client brought a suit or 

4

 whether this was  I mean, you've read the arguments. 

5

 So looking at those functional arguments, is 

6

 there any answer that you have to their point, other 

7

 than cases in different subject matters, where burdens 

8

 of proof did shift? 

9

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Well, the answer to your 

10

 question is that the normal default rule is a 

11

 fundamental tenet, that you can't go into court and say, 

12

 it's the responsibility of the defendant to disprove the 

13

 allegations of my complaint. 

14

 In cases where you have the counterclaim, of 

15

 course, the patentee is going to have the burden of 

16

 proof.  In cases where there can be no counterclaim, you 

17

 have only one party seeking relief, and that party has 

18

 the burden of proof. 

19

 And it follows from the normal default rule, 

20

 which is the rule of the Court  rule of this Court. 

21

 It's the established rule of the land.  It's a 

22

 fundamental tenet that a party cannot come into court 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Then the Declaratory 

 Judgment Act doesn't change it; that's your position? 
 What do you do about the res judicata

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 problem?  Let's assume that we put the burden of proof 

2

 where you want it.  Okay?  So this declaratory judgment 

3

 action is defeated.  All right? 

4

 Nonetheless, they say, still and all, we are 

5

 going to go ahead and not pay any royalties.  And, then, 

6

 you bring  you bring an infringement action, right? 

7

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right. 
Is  is the prior decision 

9

 res judicata, or are you going to have to relitigate the 

10

 whole thing, but, this time, with the burden of proof on 

11

 you? 

12
13
14

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

No, you're not going to have 

 to relitigate the whole thing. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why not?  You never  you 

15

 never established that you're entitled to any  any 

16

 infringement damages. 

17

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

I agree, but you're not going 

18

 to have to relitigate the whole thing.  This issue is 

19

 going to be decided on preponderance of the evidence. 

20

 And we don't have the burden.  They have the burden on 

21

 that.  Once that's decided 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, you  you would 

23

 normally have the burden as  as the person claiming 

24

 infringement. 

25

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Oh, of course.

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course. 
Of course. 
Right?  So you'll have to 

4

 relitigate the whole thing because you  you never 

5

 established that there was infringement.  In the 

6

 declaratory judgment action, all you've established is 

7

 that they didn't prove noninfringement. 

8

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

9

 I'm not arguing with it. 

10
11

Yeah.  That's all true, and 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So we have to relitigate 

 the whole thing. 

12

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

No.  First of all 
What's the alternative? 
Okay.  I will give you two 

15

 answers.  The first answer is you are never going to get 

16

 this situation because the last thing in the world 

17

 Medtronic wants to do is give up its license.  So it's 

18

 not going to  it's not going to stop paying royalties. 

19

 The same thing in 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

 (Laughter.) 

22

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

It's my hypothetical, okay? 

Okay.  Now, to follow your 

23

 to follow  to follow your hypothetical, the court who, 

24

 say, tries the issue with respect to whether or not 

25

 there's claim coverage  and let's say we prevail

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 on that.  When there's a subsequent infringement action, 

2

 you're correct, we cannot say that they're estopped by 

3

 res judicata or issue preclusion. 

4

 But we can say, Your Honor, you've seen this 

5

 entire case.  Now, where it was preponderance of the 

6

 evidence before, it's now preponderance of the evidence 

7

 on the other side.  It may be the difference between 

8

 49.9 and 50.5.  And we're going to bring a motion for 

9

 summary judgment and 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So your answer is, Justice 

11

 Scalia, you're right, but it doesn't matter very much. 

12

 That's your answer, right? 

13
14

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

And I've got one further 

 answer to that. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Okay. 
And that is, there is no 

17

 exception to  to 100 percent lack of finality with 

18

 respect to the normal default rule.  The normal default 

19

 rule is more important than saying that, if there is a 

20

 little bit of chance of a lack of finality, we're going 

21

 to throw out the entire normal default rule in  in 

22

 favor of this rule and put the burden of proof on the 

23

 party who is not even seeking any relief. 

24
25

 And there was no shifting in this case. 
 Shifting involves starting with a position, shifting to

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 another position.  As soon as they filed the suit and 

2

 you're the only party seeking relief, they would have 

3

 the burden of proof. 

4

 Now, if they are infringing, we can 

5

 counterclaim.  Then we're going to have the burden of 

6

 proof because that's an issue where you have two parties 

7

 seeking relief, and that's a little more complicated. 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why  why isn't that 

 true here?  Because you are seeking release of the 
 escrowed funds. 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

We're not seeking it in the 

12

 suit.  The way the agreement was between the parties was 

13

 if Medtronic disagrees with our assessment, then they 

14

 can go ahead and file a DJ action, and if they can 

15

 prevail in that DJ action, they won't have to pay.  We 

16

 seek nothing in the suit.  We have no counterclaim. 

17

 We're asking for nothing. 

18

 As to Justice Kennedy's question before, as 

19

 notice of infringement, there was no notice of 

20

 infringement.  What we told them was there was claim 

21

 coverage.  And there's a big difference between claim 

22

 coverage and infringement. 

23

 If we tell them that we're asserting 

24

 infringement, we're going to have the burden of proof. 

25

 We can't assert infringement because they're the

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 licensee. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, there would have 

3

 been infringement if you had refused to pay the royalty, 

4

 and 

5

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If they had 
And if they had refused to 

7

 pay the royalty and you were covered, then  then there 

8

 would have been infringement. 

9

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

But then you're changing all 

10

 the facts around.  That's not  that's not what we're 

11

 dealing with in this case. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

13

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

All right.  I understand. 
And in MedImmune 
Well, Mr. Neustadt, I think 

15

 I just disagree with that.  You keep on saying it's a 

16

 question of claim coverage, but the question of claim 

17

 coverage, all that is, is part of an infringement 

18

 analysis. 

19

 And that's the analysis, as Justice Kennedy 

20

 said, that's the analysis that would have been 

21

 appropriate if Medtronic had stopped paying royalties 

22

 and MVF had sued Medtronic as a result for patent 

23

 infringement. 

24
25

 And that's the world that we're supposed to 
 imagine after MedImmune, is if, contra the  the actual

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 agreement, the licensee stopped paying royalties, and we 

2

 think about an infringement suit. 

3

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

No.  That is  permit me to 

4

 disagree with you.  MedImmune was not involved with 

5

 that.  Here was the problem in MedImmune:  The MedImmune 

6

 did not want to continue to pay the royalties, but it 

7

 needed the license.  80 percent of its product line was 

8

 dependent upon that license. 

9

 So as a matter of sheer rigidity, they could 

10

 not not pay the royalty.  They will lose their whole 

11

 business.  They wanted to get into Federal court.  At 

12

 that time, the Federal circuit had a GenProbe ruling 

13

 which says, everyone's paying royalties, there's no 

14

 dispute.  In MedImmune, this Court reversed.  You said, 

15

 there's enough of a controversy for MedImmune to have 

16

 this  to  to go in with the DJ action. 

17

 In that suit, it'd be exactly like this 

18

 suit.  The patentee could not counterclaim because there 

19

 is no infringement.  MedImmune is still paying its 

20

 royalties. 

21

 So in the MedImmune case  but they never 

22

 got to it because  because that MedImmune case was 

23

 settled  you have the exact same situation we have 

24

 here, which is that there is no counterclaim, and 

25

 therefore, MedImmune, who is seeking relief, has the

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 burden to show it's entitled to relief. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, how  what do you do 

3

 with the government's argument here, which I take it as 

4

 being on page 17, they make an argument which, as I 

5

 understood it  which is a big qualification  the 

6

 the  some of these things are awfully complicated. 

7

 You might have a  a claim or, really, it's a set of 

8

 claims that cover 48 pages with all kinds of symbols 

9

 and  and 42 different sort of division possibilities. 

10

 And  and then the  the socalled 

11

 infringer, or the person who falls outside the coverage, 

12

 is looking at his product, and it's one of the most 

13

 complex things you've ever seen.  And he has to think to 

14

 himself, well, how  how am I supposed  how does the 

15

 claim cover this?  And  and it's  there are many, 

16

 many, many possibilities. 

17

 I take it that's what they mean when they 

18

 say it makes sense to put the burden of demonstrating 

19

 how the claim limitations map onto the accused product 

20

 because infringement may be found only when the product 

21

 falls within the scope  scope of the asserted claim or 

22

 claims in every respect. 

23

 Your client, who's the patentee, knows how. 

24

 Otherwise, he wouldn't be bringing this infringement 

25

 suit or the insidethecoverage suit or responding to

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 someone who says it's outside the coverage. 
 But  but the person who is the alleged 

3

 infringer might not know it, and therefore, it makes 

4

 sense to put everything in the same place; notice of 

5

 infringement, burden of production, burden of proof. 

6

 And that way, it will be easier to focus on what's at 

7

 stake. 

8
9

 That's what I take it their argument is. 

If 

 I've not got it right, you're certainly 

10

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

12

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

13

 First of all  well, the first answer 

I think it's pretty close. 
All right. 
It's absolutely not true. 

14

 and I'll get to the second answer  is if you have that 

15

 and say, well, it's more convenient for us to do it, 

16

 you're creating a patent law exception to the normal 

17

 default. 

18

 And that's something you keep telling the 

19

 Federal circuit not to do.  Like in eBay, don't create a 

20

 separate patent rule for injunctions. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's  it's not a patent 

22

 law exception.  It's the recognition that a procedural 

23

 device that simply changes the nominal status of the 

24

 parties doesn't change the substantive rules and that 

25

 the burden of proof counts as a substantive issue.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

But you only have that 

2

 substantive rule where the patentee counterclaims.  When 

3

 the patentee counterclaims, you have two parties seeking 

4

 relief.  Naturally, the patentee has the burden of 

5

 proof.  If there is no counterclaim, there can be no 

6

 infringement.  You're just talking about claim coverage. 

7

 But it's the second part of your question, 

8

 Justice Breyer, what happens is the  the patentee, 

9

 when they give notice of claim coverage, they can tell 

10
11
12
13

 them.  There's no mysteries 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But do they have to tell 

 them? 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Well, they always do. 

14

 There's no mystery.  If 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

They always do? 
Well, sure.  I mean, if you 

17

 go into the suit, the first question is interrogatory, 

18

 why do you think this  why do you think this is 

19

 covered?  So there's no mystery as to that.  And it's 

20

 much easier to prove noninfringement than to prove 

21

 infringement because these are governed by the all 

22

 elements rule. 

23

 The all elements rule means that if the 

24

 patentee wants to prove infringement of a claim that has 

25

 ten elements, he's got to prove ten elements or in  or

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 in your example, many more. 
 For the person who is  is the licensee, 

3

 you want to prove noninfringement, he has to only pick 

4

 one of those elements and say, I don't have it. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I see, that's a 

6

 good point.  So what you're saying is that page 19 or 

7

 whatever I quoted is a madeup thing, which doesn't 

8

 ever  never really exists in your experience. 

9
10
11
12

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Oh, that's right. 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Because the first question 

 would be, well, you tell me how  how this infringes. 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Yeah.  And that argument 

13

 wasn't even presented to the Federal circuit before its 

14

 decision.  And the Federal circuit would have openly 

15

 rejected it and say, you've got to be kidding. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So you're saying, I don't 

17

 really care about what is an action where there is an 

18

 infringement action or there even could be one in the 

19

 circumstances before us, that's not my case because 

20

 they're going to pay me forever, if they lose this 

21

 declaratory judgment, so there's no shift. 

22

 And where there's no shift, you ought to 

23

 follow the rules for where there's no shift, which is 

24

 that the burden lies on the person bringing the suit. 

25

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

That's exactly right.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

2

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

That's your argument? 
Yes.  The analysis that the 

3

 Federal circuit did is they've got a burden of proof 

4

 issue. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

6

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

I  I see. 
Let me find the controlling 

7

 law.  The controlling law is the normal default rule. 

8

 I've got only one party here seeking relief, and that's 

9

 the  the licensee, so why shouldn't he prove this? 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And your argument is that 

11

 the horribles don't exist because the one on page 19 

12

 never has come up, and as far as the no  no res 

13

 judicata, I don't care because I'll come to the same 

14

 result with a different means. 

15
16
17

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Yeah.  And then 

   
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And any other  is there 

18

 any other  is there any other practical point that 

19

 they brought up that you want respond to? 

20

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Oh, sure.  Hundreds of 

21

 claims, that's ridiculous  you know, the courts say, 

22

 hey  you know, I have other cases on my docket, get 

23

 down to five claims. 

24
25

 Anticipate any argument? 

The person suing, 

 the DJ licensee, doesn't have to anticipate any

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 argument.  He said, you told me it was these claims. 

2

 And we even had an agreement with him we couldn't go 

3

 over 30.  And all I got to do is say, in claim 1, we don't 

4

 have element number 6.  In Claim 2, we don't have 

5

 element number 4.  It's a very simple manner.  There is 

6

 no problem whatsoever there. 

7

 So what the Federal Circuit did is, I've got 

8

 a burden of proof issue.  Let me find the controlling 

9

 law.  I'll look to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court says 

10

 there is a normal default rule, and it's the party 

11

 seeking relief. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes, but you are 

13

 overlooking the  the elephant in the room, which is 

14

 the relief they are seeking is protection against the 

15

 relief that you would be seeking, but for the 

16

 declaratory judgment action. 

17

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

We  we can never seek it 

18

 because they are not infringing.  And we do not have to 

19

 file a counterclaim for claim coverage because there is 

20

 no requirement that we do so.  There is no coercive 

21

 complaint.  If they are suing  if there was a 

22

 noninfringement situation, we'd would have to file the 

23

 coercive complaint. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The Declaratory Judgment 

 Act is addressed to potential coercion, not actual

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 coercion.  That's the whole point.  You should be able 

2

 to bring the suit before coercion is applied. 

3

 Now, it is true that you're not applying 

4

 coercion right now, but what they're worried about is, 

5

 if they stop paying the royalties, you will apply 

6

 coercion, and the Declaratory Judgment Act is a way of 

7

 getting this on the table before a court without their 

8

 having to go into default and incurring all the 

9

 penalties, but it is not intended to shift the burden of 

10
11
12
13

 proof. 
 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Well, it doesn't shift the 

 burden of proof. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It does shift the burden of 

14

 proof because if what they are worried about is your 

15

 claiming infringement and  and exacting a penalty from 

16

 them for their not paying the royalties that the 

17

 agreement provides, okay, that's what they are worried 

18

 about. 

19

 The Declaratory Judgment Act enables them to 

20

 sue beforehand, before they incur liability.  That's its 

21

 whole purpose, and its purpose is not to shift the 

22

 burden of proof. 

23

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

The  in answer to your 

24

 your hypothetical, I agree with you on all of that.  But 

25

 as in the MedImmune case, MedImmune ends up with the

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 burden of proof.  MedImmune says, I've got to get a 

2

 resolution to this question.  I want you to overrule 

3

 GenPro, I want to show why the  why my product is not 

4

 covered. 

5

 Well, all of that's fine, there is nothing 

6

 the matter with that, there is no coercion.  It's just 

7

 that, when MedImmune does this, it's going to have the 

8

 burden to show it. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But you would agree with 

10

 this, you would agree that, if that agreement of yours 

11

 read a little differently, if MedImmune  if they had 

12

 said  you know, we are not going to pay royalties 

13

 until your client brings an infringement suit, which you 

14

 intend to do, at that point, if you'd made that promise, 

15

 you would have the burden of proof because you'd bring 

16

 an infringement suit. 

17

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, of course. 
And if they said either an 

19

 infringement suit or a declaratory judgment action, 

20

 then, again, you would have the burden of proof, even in 

21

 the declaratory judgment action because then they would 

22

 be totally parallel. 

23

 I mean, then you'd have, if you brought the 

24

 infringement suit, it's yours.  And then, in the 

25

 declaratory judgment action, it should be true, too, in

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 your view. 

2
3

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

 have one party seeking relief, the licensee 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

6

Well, the way it is, if you 

But I mean 
 the licensee's got the 

 burden. 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The answer is yes or no. 

8

 The answer is yes or no.  That is, am I right in  in 

9

 understanding your argument that if that agreement had 

10

 said you can bring either kind of suit, either we 

11

 yes, we the patentee, will bring a suit, in which case, 

12

 you will defend it; or if you bring it first, you can 

13

 bring a declaratory judgment action, okay, for the same 

14

 thing. 

15

 If it had said that and the agreement had 

16

 held up the royalties until one or the other was 

17

 decided, then your client, the patentee, would have the 

18

 burden of proof in either because it's exactly the same 

19

 thing. 

20
21

 You could have brought  are you following 
 me? 

22

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 (Laughter.) 

25

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

No, I'm afraid not. 
Okay.  Skip it. 

So, really, what the Federal

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 circuit did  said there was no shifting here.  First, 

2

 you've got to look to who's got the burden of proof. 

3

 You get that from Schaffer, the normal default rule, 

4

 only one party seeking relief. 

5

 And then they said, and besides, the 

6

 patentee could not have brought suit because you can't 

7

 accuse him of infringement.  So you have a simple case of 

8

 only one party seeking relief; that party has the 

9

 burden. 

10

 And you would have that anyway even  even 

11

 without this agreement, because only one party can bring 

12

 suit.  It's just like in Schaffer.  This party brings 

13

 suit, they have the burden.  Other party brings suit, 

14

 they have the burden. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you are really 

16

 looking at it, though, from the point of view of a contract 

17

 action, rather than a patent action. 

18

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Well, it can't be a patent 

19

 action because the whole purpose of the license is not 

20

 to have an infringer.  And it is a contract action and 

21

 that gets into the jurisdictional question. 

22

 And, to answer Justice Ginsburg's question, 

23

 yes, there isn't the usual jurisdiction that you would 

24

 have in a patent infringement action.  And this comes 

25

 from the unanimous opinion of this Court earlier this

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 year in Gunn vs. Minton, in which I think Your Honor 

2

 Your Honor was the author, which says that that's just a 

3

 contract action. 

4
5
6

 Just having a patent question doesn't get 
 you into Federal court. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But Mr. Neustadt, I was under 

7

 the impression that, according to this contract, if 

8

 Medtronic stops paying royalties, you can bring not 

9

 only a contract suit, but, in fact, a patent suit. 

10

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

12

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Well 
An infringement suit. 
 that has nothing to do 

13

 with the contract because then they've breached the 

14

 contract. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But you can bring an 

16

 infringement suit according to the very agreement that 

17

 you signed. 

18

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

It's not in accordance with 

19

 the agreement.  We can't bring an infringement suit. 

20

 They are not infringing. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

22

 break the contract, and they stop paying royalties. 

23

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

They are infringing if they 

Oh, sure. 
And then you can bring an 

 infringement suit.

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Well, of course.  But that's 

2

 not the situation we face here.  That  that's always 

3

 been true.  I mean, if they want to, if the burden of 

4

 proof is so burdensome to them, just go ahead and 

5

 breach.  And then we will sue them, and we will have the 

6

 burden of proof. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You can always say that in 

8

 declaratory judgment actions, that is not the situation 

9

 we face.  The Declaratory Judgment Act posits a 

10

 hypothetical situation.  It always does. 

11

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You cannot say that we're going to 
I am worried that you are 

13

 going to sue me later.  You are not suing me now. 

14

 That's not the situation I face.  But I worry that you 

15

 will sue me later. 

16

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

But you have  but how can I 

17

 sue later if you're continuing to pay royalties?  That 

18

 was  that was the MedImmune situation.  MedImmune 

19

 said, I've got to pay you royalties 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They don't want to  they 

21

 don't want to continue to pay royalties.  That's the 

22

 point.  That's why they bring the Declaratory Judgment 

23

 Act, so that the court can tell them, you don't have to 

24

 pay royalties because this stuff is not covered. 

25

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Well, that's absolutely

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 right.  But in that case  and the court didn't rule 

2

 upon it because it got remanded  they would have the 

3

 burden of proof because they are the only party seeking 

4

 relief.  You can't say not only 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You cite  you cite the 

6

 default rule, and you rely on that totally.  But there 

7

 are other rules on burden of proof, for example, the 

8

 party who has better access to the information, so it's 

9

 not as though there is this firm rule with no 

10
11

 exceptions. 
 I take it, from your answers to 

12

 Justice Scalia, that you are saying in every declaratory 

13

 judgment action where only one party is seeking relief, 

14

 that party has the burden of proof.  So you're not 

15

 limiting this to patent cases; is that right? 

16

 MR. NEUSTADT: 

Oh, that's correct.  That's 

17

 the normal default rule.  And there should be no 

18

 exception to that.
