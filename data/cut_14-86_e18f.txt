 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 1486, the Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores.

 Mr. Gershengorn. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 
 The Tenth Circuit imposed two requirements 

12

on religious accommodation claims that eliminated 

13

liability for Respondent's refusal to accommodate 

14

Ms. Elauf here:  First, that the applicant herself 

15

verbally requested the accommodation; and second, that 

16

the employer know, rather than just correctly 

17

understand, the need for an accommodation. 

18

 Neither required 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand.  What 

20

is the difference between knowing and correctly 

21

understanding? 

22

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, the 

23

testimony  it  it's a fair question.  The Tenth 

24

Circuit perceived a difference.  What the testimony was 

25

was that Ms. Cooke assumed that the  that Ms. Elauf

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

needed to wear the headscarf because she was religious, 

2

that she figured that the headscarf signified that it 

3

was a religious headscarf, and that she figured it was a 

4

religious headscarf.  What the Tenth Circuit said was 

5

that was insufficient; what was needed was actual 

6

knowledge. 

7

 Our position is that when you figure, when 

8

you assume, when you  when it signifies to you that a 

9

religious accommodation is needed, that is sufficient 

10

notice for an employer to be on notice. 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, suppose 
Does that subjective 

13

I'm sorry.  Does that subjective or  is it even 

14

relevant?  Meaning  the issue is whether they failed 

15

to hire her because of her religious practice.  Whether 

16

the person thinks it is is the issue.  I mean, that's 

17

why they acted. 

18

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That's right, Your Honor. 

19

And we think that's what makes this a particularly 

20

straightforward case.  What the employer did here was 

21

act upon the assumption that Ms. Elauf needed to wear 

22

the headscarf for religious reasons, and yet that it 

23

later claimed refuge that it didn't have sufficient 

24

knowledge or certainty to actually have initiated the 

25

accommodation process that Congress wanted in Section

4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

2000e2. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But getting back to 

3

Justice Scalia's question, I think there's some 

4

substantial force to your argument that the employee 

5

doesn't have to mention this first. 

6

 But why  why do we  import the term 

7

understand instead of know.  In a treatment case, the 

8

whole idea is that  that prohibited action was taken 

9

because of religion.  It's what you knew.  Why  why 

10
11

are you making it so confusing? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I  with 

12

respect to  it's our position it's the Tenth Circuit 

13

that's made it confusing.  What the Tenth Circuit has 

14

done is said when you know 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Your position  your 

16

statement that you opened with is  is that he must 

17

understand.  You stay away from the word "know".  And 

18

Justice Scalia asked you what  why you did that, and I 

19

can't understand your answer. 

20

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So the answer, Your Honor, 

21

is we think that there is sufficient knowledge, notice, 

22

when somebody understands that  when somebody assumes 

23

that a practice is religious and then acts upon it, that 

24

that is sufficient. 

25

 What the Tenth Circuit said was that is not

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sufficient, that what is needed is something more 

2

approaching certainty.  If that's not 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Gershengorn, I 

4

mean, so that does raise the question if yours is less 

5

than certainty, how much less than certainty is it?  I 

6

mean, suppose I'm an employer, and I say, you know, I 

7

don't honestly know, I think.  You know, it's two out of 

8

three.  Is that sufficient? 

9

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I think 

10

that if I could explain how these cases come up, I think 

11

it will  the best way to answer your  it would be 

12

the best way to answer your question. 

13

 The answer is, in a situation like this in 

14

which it's an applicant applying for a  a position, 

15

and the employer suspects, thinks, twothirds, that 

16

there's a religious problem  the  a religious 

17

conflict, the employer has two options.  It can assume 

18

there is no conflict, in which case they  they make 

19

the hiring decision on the merits.  In that case here, 

20

Ms. Elauf would have been hired. 

21

 Alternatively, if the employer feels like 

22

there's enough concern to  about how Ms. Elauf would 

23

be able to perform, they can raise  start a dialogue. 

24

That's what  what Congress intended.  What they can't 

25

do is what they did here and assume through a stereotype

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that there was going to be a need for accommodation, and 

2

then say, having assumed that, I don't have any 

3

obligation to actually try to accommodate that. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6

No.  You're 

promoting 

7

 Go ahead. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

Is that true even if it's 

Is that true even if it's 

under 50 percent?  In other words, say that employer 

10

says, you know, I really don't know, but I think 

11

there's, like, a 50/50 chance or even a 40 percent 

12

chance that this person has a religious  that  has 

13

religious  that this practice is religious.  And I 

14

don't really feel like getting into all this 

15

accommodation stuff, so I'm not going to hire this 

16

person. 

17
18
19
20

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So I think, Your Honor, 

that that's what they cannot do.  But I do think 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So it doesn't really depend 

on what the percentage chance is. 

21

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So I think 
It could be certain, it 

23

could be less than certain, it could be a lot less than 

24

certain, as long as the employer says there's some 

25

chance, and I'm not going to hire, or promote, or fire,

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

or whatever, because of that chance. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I  I 

3

would like to try to separate out two different  two 

4

different situations that a  could arise, only one of 

5

which we think arises commonly.  One is that the 

6

employer has a work rule and is concerned that the 

7

applicant before it won't be able to comply in the 

8

future with the  after being hired, with the work 

9

rule, because they perceive that the person is 

10
11

religious. 
 I think the dilemma that Your Honor is 

12

posing is really a false one there.  If the employer 

13

really has a very small in  understanding or thinks 

14

there's  it's very unlikely that the employee would be 

15

religious, the right thing for the employer to do is to 

16

assume that there's isn't a religious problem, to not 

17

engage in the stereotyping and assume that the person 

18

could comply as they would with somebody who was wearing 

19

a headscarf or something else for not religious reasons. 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not sure I 

understand why you're fighting Justice Kagan's question. 
 Isn't the issue the reason that they acted? 

23

They refused to hire someone because they had a 

24

1 percent belief that they had a religious  pardon the 

25

pun  a religious belief that they wouldn't

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

accommodate? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I don't 

3

intend to fight Justice Kagan's hypothetical, and on the 

4

facts of this case, I think it's really quite easy.  But 

5

the reason why I'm trying to separate the two is because 

6

I think the situation here is the easy case, and I'll 

7

get to why the hard case and why I'm sort of fighting 

8

Justice Kagan. 

9
10

confusing me enormously. 

11

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

You  you're  you're 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay. 
Would you tell me what it 

is you want. 

14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I want 
You just say he 

16

understands.  That doesn't do anything for me.  What he 

17

understands, knows, believes, suspects.  What  what 

18

other  what other verbs do you need? 

19

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, the test 

20

that the courts of appeals have adopted for more than 

21

two decades, which is the test that we ask this Court to 

22

adopt, is that the employer needs sufficient information 

23

from any source about the employee  about the 

24

applicant's religious needs 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That 

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

to understand the existence of a conflict. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10

To understand 
That's the test that the 

courts of appeals have been 

6

9

 to permit the employer 

I don't care 
 for two decades. 
 what they've used.  That 

doesn't make any sense to me. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

But, Your Honor, the 

11

reason why I think it makes sense in this case is 

12

because if it's sufficient knowledge for you to actually 

13

act upon it  remember, if they  if  the critical 

14

point here for us is if they had not  if the employer 

15

had not assumed that this was religious, had not 

16

believed it, they would have hired her.  The default 

17

rule for "I'm not sure," is hire. 

18
19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Gershengorn, 

didn't 

20

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What 
 she  the person 

22

the firstline hire, person responsible for hiring, 

23

didn't she say to the district manager, I think she's 

24

wearing this headscarf for religious reasons, and that's 

25

why I'm checking it out with you.  The answer she got

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

back was, it doesn't matter whether it's for religious 

2

reasons.  We don't  we don't accommodate people who 

3

wear headscarfs. 

4

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That's right, Your Honor. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So  so it seems that 

6

the  the district manager is  his point of view is 

7

headscarfs are out.  This particular woman was wearing 

8

one for religious reasons, but it doesn't matter what 

9

reason, we don't accommodate headscarfs. 

10

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I think that's right, Your 

11

Honor, and that's exactly what Congress said when it 

12

enacted these provisions. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

15
16

No, it didn't. 
They didn't want to 

happen 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There is no law against 

17

such a rule.  Any employer can have a rule, We don't 

18

allow headscarfs.  And until someone applies for a job 

19

who, for a religious reason, wants to wear a headscarf 

20

and the employer knows that it's for a religious reason 

21

or suspects, or believes, or understands, or whatever 

22

verbs you want to use, there's been no violation of the 

23

law.  You can  you can have that rule. 

24

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Absolutely, Your Honor. 
We don't allow our

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employees to wear headscarfs.  Nothing wrong with that 

2

rule. 

3
4
5

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That's correct, Your 

Honor.  But once 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So the mere fact that 

6

this  this supervisor said that doesn't prove a 

7

violation by the employer. 

8

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

9

Well, I don't agree with 

that, Your Honor.  I think once the  it's clear that 

10

the employee is  needs an accommodation of that rule, 

11

that's exactly what Title VII requires.  That's what the 

12

Court addressed in Hardison.  It was a neutral rule that 

13

you had to work on the Sabbath, but what the court 

14

said 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's right, but that 

supervisor did not have that knowledge. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Oh, no, Your Honor. 

18

That's not correct.  The  and I took from Justice 

19

Ginsburg's hypothetical  question that  that what we 

20

believe to be the case, that Cooke conferred  conveyed 

21

to her supervisor, Johnson, that it was for a religious 

22

reason.  There's a dispute of the  in testimony about 

23

this, but what Cooke said  and remember summary 

24

judgment has now been granted against us, so the 

25

evidence read in our favor  what Cooke said was, I

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

told Johnson that it was for religious reasons, and 

2

Johnson said, if we allow this then someone will paint 

3

themselves green and call it a religion.  We can't allow 

4

it. 

5
6
7

 So the court decides the question on the 
assumption that the decisionmakers knew 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, your  your 

8

solution that you suggested is that if there's some 

9

doubt the employer should begin a dialogue, I think is 

10

what you  but I think that may promote stereotypes to 

11

a far greater degree than what you're objecting to. 

12

 Let's say you have someone of Middle Eastern 

13

appearance who shows up for the interview with a beard. 

14

And the employer, like Abercrombie & Fitch, they don't 

15

like beards.  They don't want their models, as they call 

16

them, having beards.  But he doesn't know if the beard 

17

is there for a  religious reason or not. 

18

 So you think it's better to him to sit there 

19

and start asking this applicant questions he would not 

20

ask anyone else about religion?  Why are you wearing a 

21

beard?  Is there some religious reason for that?  It 

22

seems that your solution causes more problems. 

23

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I have two 

24

responses that I'd like to say.  First, I  I don't 

25

think it's right that the solution causes more problems

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because I don't think that what Congress would have 

2

preferred is that the person not get hired than that the 

3

dialogue be begun.  If those are the two options, I 

4

think it's clear Congress wanted an accommodation of the 

5

religious practice. 

6

 But I also think that Your Honor's 

7

hypothetical points out quite nicely the  that it's 

8

somewhat  it's a somewhat artificial situation here. 

9

What the employer is saying is, I don't want a beard 

10

when the person is on the floor.  But that's not a 

11

reason not to hire someone who walks in the door with a 

12

beard.  The New York Yankees, for example, have for 

13

decades had a no facial hair policy, but they don't not 

14

pursue free agents that wear beards.  They assume that 

15

those free agents can  can shave once they get to the 

16

Yankees.  It's the same 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, is it 

18

reasonable for an employer to say, look, I don't want to 

19

buy into some problem with a guy who has a beard.  I'm 

20

going to say can you shave it?  He's going to say no or 

21

he's only going to shave twice a week. 

22

 I mean, isn't he reasonably going to say 

23

let's say, I don't care if it's religious  a religious 

24

reason or not.  The guy shows up with a beard.  I'm not 

25

going to hire him.

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, that's the 

2

hard question that I think Justice Kagan was asking, and 

3

I do think that's a trickier question. 

4

 If your policy is not I have a work rule 

5

that I'm concerned you won't be able to comply with in 

6

the future, then I think, for all the reasons I've said 

7

thus far, it's all said. 

8

 If the question is when someone comes to my 

9

office with a beard and I just think they're  it's 

10

unkempt, I don't like it, I'm not going to hire them 

11

regardless of whether they could comply, I think that's 

12

the situation that presents this, is it onethird, is it 

13

twothirds.  I think that's a hard question.  It's not 

14

the one presented here.  And, quite candidly, it's not 

15

the kinds of cases that we actually see.  They much more 

16

are the work rule. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You could avoid those hard 

18

questions, whether it's understand, believe, suspect, by 

19

adopting the rule that the court of appeals adopted 

20

here; and that is, if you want to sue me for denying you 

21

a job for a religious reason, the burden is on you to 

22

say, I'm wearing the headscarf for a religious reason, 

23

or I'm wearing the beard for a religious reason. 

24

That  that avoids all problems.  Once you notify the 

25

employer that it's for a religious reason, you got 'em.

15

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So, Your Honor 
Did the employer tell 

3

her  did the employer tell her that it had this Look 

4

Policy 

5

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And so that 
 that a headscarf would 

7

violate?  How could she ask for something when she 

8

didn't know the employer had such a rule? 

9

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That's exactly the 

10

problem, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, in 

11

response to your question.  The reason that's 

12

insufficient is that it is simply not the case that 

13

Respondent  as Respondent suggests that the superior 

14

knowledge is with the applicant in that situation.  The 

15

applicant is not on notice of what the work rules are. 

16

And, indeed, in this situation, the testimony was 

17

uncontroverted that Ms. Elauf did not know there was a 

18

Look Policy that prohibited the headscarf.  And so 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, wait a minute.  This 

20

is not the place to get into the facts.  But I  I 

21

thought her friend told her to wear at least a colored 

22

scarf, so the subject came up.  So I  I 

23
24
25

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

But  but actually, 

Justice Kennedy, that 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Again, we're  we're not

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

factfinders here. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

No, I understand.  But 

3

it's  it's important, Your Honor, because actually 

4

that, in fact, supports our position because what the 

5

what her friend said was, there's no problem with a 

6

headscarf, it just shouldn't be black.  And so she then 

7

wore  if anything, she was on notice that there was no 

8

problem with the headscarf.  So I actually think it cuts 

9

exactly the other way. 

10

 And, Justice Ginsburg, to pick up on your 

11

point, what makes it particularly inappropriate, I 

12

think, to put the burden on the applicant here is that 

13

it's the employer who gets to structure the interview. 

14

And, in fact, the employer here read some version of the 

15

Look Policy, but did not mention the headscarfs. 

16

 So, actually, this was a situation in which 

17

the employer itself could have put Elauf on notice, and 

18

then it's a very different situation.  If the employer 

19

says, we don't allow headscarfs, and then  and then 

20

the employee doesn't say anything, I think that's a very 

21

different situation.

To get 
But 
To get back to my 

beard case, is there  if it's someone with a Middle

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Eastern appearance with a beard, you want the employer to 

2

begin some kind of a dialogue.  If it's somebody who's not 

3

Middle Eastern and has a beard, can the employer assume, 

4

well, I don't think that's for religious reasons? 

5

 In other words, he's going to be asking 

6

religious questions of some people based on a 

7

stereotype, but not others. 

8

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why  why does he have 

to ask about religious beliefs? 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Could you answer my 

question, please? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Sure, Your Honor. 

13

Although part of the answer is that I don't think 

14

they  that the employer does.  As I've said earlier, 

15

the right approach for the employer who really wants to 

16

avoid the subject is to assume that the person of Middle 

17

Eastern descent, just like the person not of Middle 

18

Eastern descent, has a beard for personal preference and 

19

would be happy to shave if he got the job in order to 

20

comply with the work rules. 

21
22
23

 And that is what is critical for it. 

That 

is what Congress wanted to accomplish here. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So why can't the 

24

employer just simply say, we have a Look Policy that 

25

doesn't permit beards.  Can you comply with that policy?

18

Alderson Reporting Company

3

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Absolutely, Your Honor. 

That  those 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's all they have 

4

to  they don't have to ask about reasons or no 

5

reasons.  It doesn't really matter why. 

6

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Right.  As I tried 

7

there are two options.  One is the one I gave to the 

8

Chief Justice, which is you can assume the person 

9

doesn't wear it for religious reasons and then hire 

10

them; or if you're concerned about it, you can ask a 

11

specific question.  The EEOC has made clear that that 

12

is 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The question is 

14

supposed  the question is supposed to be why are you 

15

wearing a beard? 

16

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

No.  The question is, we 

17

have a work rule that prohibits facial hair on the 

18

floor, on the force, on the 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So that doesn't 

20

cover anything that's not immediately apparent 

21

apparent by the appearance.  You make  they can have a 

22

code of conduct that presumably would go through several 

23

pages, here are all the things we require.  Any problem 

24

with any of them? 

25

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I actually

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think that that  this is a protect  that their 

2

the employer is at no risk of liability if he asks no 

3

questions but makes no assumptions and stereotypes.  And 

4

that's why I don't think what Your Honor's hypothesizing 

5

turns out to be a problem in practice. 

6

 What is going on is that in the minerun of 

7

cases that the EEOC brings at the depth we see in these 

8

cases is you're talking about a work rule.  You're 

9

talking about you must wear pants at work, and the 

10

employer has a religious objection, thinks women should 

11

wear skirts.  You're talking about a no long hair 

12

policy.  You're  you're talking about groom and garb. 

13

And the concern is will you be able to comply in the 

14

future. 

15

 The employer doesn't have to run down those 

16

questions.  The employer can assume there's no religious 

17

problem, can avoid the stereotyping.  However, if the 

18

employer wishes, what the Court said in Ansonia is that 

19

a bilateral dialogue is what Title VII is designed to 

20

accomplish. 

21

 And so picking up on Justice Sotomayor's 

22

point, you could raise the policy.  And this is not a 

23

crazy idea.  This is what 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Could  could I 

25

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

 Respondent did.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I understand.  Could 

2

could I ask you  he can ask can you do it?  Is  is 

3

that the only religious preference that has to be 

4

honored?  I can, but, you know, really, I would like not 

5

to for a religious reason.  I  I guess I could take off 

6

my headscarf or whatnot, but it would be very 

7

inappropriate, religiously uncomfortable. 

8

 Is  is that a 

9

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

10

So, Your Honor 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Are  are you 

11

acknowledging that  that the only accommodation that 

12

has to be made is an accommodation for somebody who 

13

absolutely for a religious reason cannot do something? 

14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

No, Your Honor. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I didn't think so. 

16

 MR. GERSHENGORN:

case is about.  What  because the question 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

So you can't ask that. 

You  you cannot ask the question 

20

22

But that is not what this 

I'm sorry, I 
 you're telling them to 

ask, can you do it?  Well, yes, I guess I could, but 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

But that's the exact 

24

dialogue that's supposed to happen.  What this  that's 

25

what this Court said should happen.  That's the

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

bilateral dialogue. 
 What Congress wanted when it passed a 

3

reasonable accommodation requirement is precisely for 

4

the employer and the employee or the employee not to 

5

have to do anything. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So she says, yes, I could. 

7

And later says, yeah, I could, but  but, boy, it is 

8

really uncomfortable for me to do that for religious 

9

reasons.  Would she still have a lawsuit? 

10
11
12
13
14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Well, she wouldn't have a 

lawsuit, but she might be able to 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All she said was, yes, I 

could.  She could. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Well, if she could, then 

15

she was hired.  Then when she says, actually, now it's 

16

quite uncomfortable, that's a request for an 

17

accommodation, and she and the employer need to go into 

18

a discussion, just like you would if you said, I need 

19

this  I need this time off to attend a religious 

20

conversion ceremony, which was at issue in the Ninth 

21

Circuit case in Heller.  That's just the backandforth 

22

of everyday employeremployee relations. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, couldn't the employer 

24

say, we have a policy no beards, or whatever, do you 

25

have any problem with that?  Why do you have to  why

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

does it have to be phrased, could you do it?  Just say, 

2

do you have any problem with that? 

3
4

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I think that's another way 

to phrase it. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

6

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Are you willing to do it? 
It's  it's a matter  I 

7

think what the  what  what Title VII is about, what 

8

this Court has recognized and what certainly the EEOC 

9

has recognized is the actual accommodation back and 

10

forth is quite a flexible process.  It's designed to be 

11

collaborative.  And so there isn't a fixed rule you have 

12

to phrase it this way or phrase it that way. 

13

 I think the point is to initiate the 

14

dialogue.  And I think had that happened here, then 

15

then we would be talking about a different point in the 

16

process about whether there was a reasonable 

17

accommodation that could be done and whether it could be 

18

done without undue hardship.  But that dialogue never 

19

happened here, and that is the problem with the case as 

20

we see it.

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The 
And the 
The Respondent says that 

24

you switched theories in midstream, that you started out 

25

with a refusal to accommodate theory and then you

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

abandoned that.  Is that 

2

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

4

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That is not correct 
 not so? 
 Justice Ginsburg.  From 

5

the very beginning, our theory has been that the 

6

Respondent violated Title VII by refusing to accommodate 

7

Ms. Elauf.  That was the theory that was presented in 

8

the complaint.  It's the theory we got summary judgment 

9

and damages on.  It's the theory we defended in the 

10

court of appeals.  And it's the  it's the theory we 

11

have  we have proceeded under on all of our cases 

12

here.  There has been no switch.  The phrase "religious 

13

accommodation" appears 14 times in our 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So that  that's 

15

disparate treatment plus failure to accommodate, 

16

correct? 

17

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

18

word "disparate treatment." 

19

So they have seized on the 

 I'd like to  if I can avoid a yes/no and 

20

just explain our position on disparate treatment, 

21

Justice Kennedy. 

22

 The brief  the phrase used in the brief 

23

was that a failure to accommodate is  is the kind of 

24

disparate treatment that Title VII was designed to 

25

prevent.  We think that is correct and accurate, that

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what the Congress meant to do was put people who needed 

2

an accommodation like Ms. Elauf, a headscarf 

3

accommodation, on the same footing as people who did not 

4

need to wear a head  headgear.  That is the sense in 

5

which we  this is disparate treatment. 

6

 However, we recognize that the EEOC and the 

7

lower courts have used disparate treatment in another 

8

way, which is to say there's a disparate treatment way 

9

to prove discrimination, a failure to accommodate 

10
11

theory. 
 We did not and  and to highlight the 

12

difference, a disparate treatment would be you allow all 

13

hats, but not religious hats.  That's disparate 

14

treatment.  This is you don't  you don't allow any 

15

hats, but we want to wear a religious hat.  That would 

16

be a failure to accommodate.  We did not, at any point 

17

in this case, abandon or change our theory from the 

18

failure to accommodate. 

19

 What the other side has done is assert not 

20

only that we did that, but we did it for some motive, 

21

because we wished to avoid a 1981a question, a case  a 

22

question which a  no court has ever adopted their 

23

theory and which at no point in this litigation have 

24

they ever raised, even though 1981a was the only theory 

25

on which we could get damages in the district court.  We

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

had a damages trial and 1981a was the only source of 

2

damages.  They never raised it.  Our pretrial brief said 

3

we're proceeding under 1981a.  The district court's 

4

pretrial order listed 1981a.  That was the basis of 

5

our damages. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  Again, I'm a 

7

little confused.  I didn't know  I  I read your 

8

complaint, and it says, "The Respondent refused to hire 

9

Ms. Elauf because she wears a hijab and further failed 

10

to accommodate her religious belief by making an 

11

exception to the Look Policy." 

12

 I looked at your briefs, I looked at the 

13

jury charge; and it seems like the two were always tied. 

14

The failure to hire was because they refused to 

15

accommodate her. 

16

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That's correct, Your 

17

Honor.  And that has been our theory from the very 

18

beginning.  So the idea that 1981a magically became part 

19

of this case when we mentioned the word "disparate 

20

treatment" in our opening brief is just not credible. 

21

That has been the theory.  They  they  that's how 

22

the damages were done.  They never raised it on appeal. 

23

They never raised it in the 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, suppose they had. 

Their argument is that you get damages only for

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

intentional. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your  Your Honor, no 

3

court has ever addressed that, but our position is 

4

and this is how the courts have uniformly applied it 

5

that this is intentional discrimination under 1981a, 

6

although it's not a question that's before this Court. 

7

The reason for that is 1981a distinguishes between 

8

and this is  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  It's in the red 

9

brief on Page 1a, and it's 42 U.S.C. 1981a(a).  It 

10

distinguishes between unlawful intentional 

11

discrimination, not an employment practice that is 

12

unlawful because of its disparate impact.  The failure 

13

to accommodate claim is neither disparate  is not a 

14

disparate impact claim, and it is intentional 

15

discrimination for exactly the reason that Justice 

16

Sotomayor has said.  It's the intentional refusal to 

17

hire because of a religious practice that you could 

18

reasonably accommodate.  And this is not as the amicus 

19

brief  some of the amicus briefs have suggested, just 

20

a disparate impact claim. 

21
22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I'm  I'm sorry to be 

obtuse. 

23

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Yes. 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I don't know why you just 

25

don't concede that that's a form of disparate 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

disparate treatment.  Failure to accommodate is a form 

2

of disparate treatment.  I don't accommodate you because 

3

of your religion.  Disparate treatment. 

4
5
6
7

9

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I  as I 

tried to suggest 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You know what?  I 

I'm  I'm just 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

 I think it is a form 

of 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 missing something. 

11

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

 disparate treatment as 

12

we've used it in the Act.  I just want to distinguish 

13

the different theories, because under a disparate 

14

treatment approach, there  there's a  as the lower 

15

courts have used it, you would have to show that it was 

16

because of the religious nature of the practice that you 

17

didn't accommodate. 

18

 So, for example, again, that I allow hats 

19

for everyone, but not if you have a religious hat.  That 

20

would be a  as the lower courts have called  a 

21

conventional disparate treatment claim. 

22

 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Thank you, counsel. 

Official

1
2
3
4

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. 

DVORETZKY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court; 
 The premise of the EEOC's argument today, as 

5

I understand it, is that Abercrombie acted because of 

6

the religious basis for Ms. Elauf's headscarf. 

7

 That is not correct as a factual matter; and 

8

the EEOC's theory, in its brief, does not depend on any 

9

such assumption.  The EEOC's theory in its brief is that 

10

anytime an employer suspects a possible conflict or 

11

correctly understands such a conflict, at that point it 

12

is on notice and must offer a religious accommodation. 

13

 And so if you imagine a situation, which is 

14
15

not at all 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

They don't have to offer 

16

a religious accommodation if they have a reasonable 

17

basis not to.  I mean, you follow the statute.  You only 

18

have to accommodate if it's not an undue burden. 

19

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

That  that's true, they 

20

always have the undue burden defense; but absent an 

21

undue burden, they must accommodate and they must depart 

22

from a religionneutral policy based on a mere suspicion 

23

of a possible conflict. 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

we go back to their position.

No.  It's not an un 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I 
It's very simple, 

3

because you're mischaracterizing it.  Their position is, 

4

if you believe that someone  believe, know  we're 

5

a lot of adjectives  that someone will need a 

6

religious accommodation, then  and won't comply with 

7

your policy, just ask them, do you have a  just the 

8

way Justice Alito said.  You know, we don't permit 

9

facial hair on the floor.  You have a problem with that? 

10

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Justice Sotomayor, as  as 

11

an initial matter, their theory in their brief does not 

12

depend on any sort of assumption about whether the 

13

applicant would later be able to comply with the work 

14

rule or not. 

15

 Under the theory expressed in their brief, 

16

even if an employer like Abercrombie had a policy in 

17

which the Look Policy applied at the interview, you are 

18

being assessed at the interview based on your compliance 

19

with our dress 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you think that the  do 

21

you think that the employee has to say, I am dressed the 

22

way I am for a religious reason? 

23

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Not necessarily.  However, 

24

the employer's knowledge has to be traced to the 

25

employee in some way.  In the typical case, that is

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to come directly from the employee because of the 

2

individualized and personal nature of religion 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  Let's say 

4

four  four people show up for a job interview at 

5

Abercrombie. 

6
7

 And half  this is going to sound like a 
joke, but, you know, it's not. 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So the first is a Sikh man 

10

wearing a turban, the second is a Hasidic man wearing a 

11

hat, the third is a Muslim woman wearing a niqab, the 

12

fourth is a Catholic nun in a habit. 

13

 Now, do you think the employer has to 

14

that those people have to say, we just want to tell you, 

15

we're dressed this way for a religious reason.  We're 

16

not just trying to make a fashion statement. 

17

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

First of all, Your Honor, 

18

one aspect of your hypothetical is not a joke; and that 

19

is, that many of these interviews at Abercrombie are, in 

20

fact, group interviews.  And I think 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

22

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

23

Are the what?  Group? 
Group  group interviews 

where there are mul  multiple applicants at a time. 

24

 And so I think the reality is, it's a lot 

25

more difficult than the government imagines to start

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

having these individualized dialogues. 
 But going to your point about those sorts 

3

of religious outfits, one can certainly imagine cases 

4

in which it is more obvious than others that a 

5

particular  a particular garb is likely worn for 

6

religious purposes. 

7

 However, I would direct the Court, if I 

8

could, to Joint Appendix 130 and 131, which contain 

9

pictures of the sort of headscarf that Ms. Elauf was 

10
11

actually wearing in this case. 
 Those sorts of situations where it's far 

12

more ambiguous whether a  whether a particular outward 

13

symbol is religious in nature or not will be far more 

14

common. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that can be the case, 

16

but I want to know the answer to the question whether 

17

the employee has to say, I'm wearing this for a 

18

religious reason, or whether you're willing to admit 

19

that there are at least some circumstances in which the 

20

employer is charged with that knowledge based on what 

21

the employer observes. 

22

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

No, Your Honor.  I think 

23

there are some circumstances in which it is certainly 

24

more likely than others, but the question before the 

25

Court is to devise a rule that's going to apply across

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the board. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Actually, I didn't think 

3

that was the question.  I thought the question presented 

4

was that the Tenth Circuit had said, Employer, unless 

5

you know from the woman who is applying, from the 

6

applicant, unless you receive direct, explicit notice 

7

that what she wants to wear is based on religion and she 

8

wants an accommodation, unless you receive direct, 

9

explicit notice from her, you're home free to do what 

10
11

you want. 
 Now, in their question presented, they say, 

12

in the last few words in describing it, we think that's 

13

wrong. 

14

 Now, I agree that we have to say whether 

15

that's wrong and, if it is wrong, it would be helpful to 

16

say what they have to do.  So the SG says, here is what 

17

it is.  If the employer correctly infers, correctly 

18

understands, and I would add "or correctly believes" 

19

that a practice is religious and an accommodation is 

20

necessary, that's it.  Then he has to accommodate unless 

21

he has one of the excuses under the statute, et cetera. 

22

 Okay. 

23

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

What's wrong with that? 
Justice Breyer, I think 

24

what you've just described is a rule for all cases and 

25

it's one that is entirely unadministrable for courts,

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

employers, and applicants alike. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It is  it is 

3

unadministrable to say that if the employer believes, 

4

thinks, this woman is religious and needs an 

5

accommodation and he's right, well, do something unless 

6

you have an excuse. 

7

 What  why is that unadministrable? 

8

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

9

Your Honor, I believe that's 

unadministrable because the EEOC does not explain what 

10

level of certainty is required for a belief versus 

11

suspecting 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh no, you have to prove. 

13

This  this is correct.  You have to prove he has a 

14

belief.  Now, we probably in 250,000 Federal cases a 

15

year, of those, say, 80,000 that go to trial.  Proving 

16

that somebody has a belief or other is probably at issue 

17

in 90 percent of them.  Now, I'm making that up, that 

18

number, but nonetheless, I don't think it's uncommon in 

19

the law that you have to prove that somebody believes 

20

something.  So we say, the standard of proving belief is 

21

like in any other case. 

22

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

I don't think this is like 

23

any other case, because you're dealing with  you're 

24

dealing with something  religious belief, which is 

25

inherently personal to the individual.  And to charge

34

Alderson Reporting Company

1

employers with  to charge employers with Title VII 

2

liability and require them to come to an understanding 

3

of whether a particular practice is religious or not 

4
5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

This is  this is such 



6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Now, Mr. Dvoretzky, suppose 

7

an employer just doesn't want to hire any Jews, and 

8

somebody walks in and his name is Noah Goldberg, and he 

9

looks kind of Jewish and the employer doesn't know he's 

10

Jewish.  No absolute certainty and certainly 

11

Mr. Goldberg doesn't say anything about being Jewish, 

12

but the employer just operates on an assumption that 

13

he's Jewish, so no, he doesn't get the job.  Is that a 

14

violation? 

15
16

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

That is a disparate 

treatment violation of Title VII.  But the employer 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That has got to be against 

18

the law, right?  It doesn't matter whether the employer 

19



20

 (Laughter.) 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

22
23

It doesn't matter whether 

the employer knows it to an absolute certainty, right? 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Absolutely, because in that 

24

situation, because what's relevant is the employer's 

25

intent.  If the employer intends to discriminate on the

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

basis of religion, then that's a Title VII violation. 

2

What's going on here, however, is that the employer 

3

seeks to apply a religionneutral dress code.  Religion, 

4

according to Johnson 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Except in Title VII, you 

6

would be right if all that Title VII did was prevent 

7

religious discrimination, but it makes a religious 

8

practice, a refusal to accommodate a religious practice 

9

is itself a violation of Title VII. 

10

 So we have  it's  and that was done 

11

deliberately, was it not, so that religious practices 

12

would have to be accommodated. 

13

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Yes, Your Honor, and two 

14

points in response to that, if I may.  One, we're not 

15

contending that religious practices don't have to be 

16

accommodated.  What we are contending as an initial 

17

matter is that an employer does not intentionally 

18

discriminate on the basis of a religious practice by 

19

enforcing a religionneutral dress code that would have 

20

been have been enforced 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But the thing about my 

22

question was, is that what this statute does is to say 

23

that if you are, in fact, wearing a headscarf for 

24

religious reasons, that your neutral policy really 

25

doesn't matter, it only matters if you  if there's an

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

undue burden and you really can't make an accommodation, 

2

but except for that, it really doesn't matter.  You just 

3

have to hire me, even if I'm wearing a headscarf.  And 

4

so the fact that you don't know that I'm wearing a 

5

headscarf for religious reasons, that you only kind of 

6

assume that, because most people do wear headscarves for 

7

religious reasons, it shouldn't make any more difference 

8

than in the hypothetical that I gave. 

9

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Your Honor, on  on that 

10

logic, it also would make no difference if the employer 

11

had absolutely no idea that the headscarf was worn for 

12

religious reasons, because it would still be a religious 

13

headscarf and a religious practice.  Not even the EEOC 

14

is claiming that there's a duty to accommodate in that 

15

situation.  And so the question before the Court is, at 

16

what level of knowledge does the employer have to have 

17

before the duty to accommodate is triggered.  For 40 

18

years, the EEOC's own guidance has put the burden to 

19

initiate the conversation on the employee because only 

20

the employee knows. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's if the employee 

22

knows the rule.  But here the employee had no reason to 

23

think that there was anything offensive about her dress. 

24

How can she say, by the way, I have a religious reason 

25

for wearing this headscarf, when from everything, from

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all appearances, the employer doesn't care.  It's okay 

2

to wear a headscarf.  Then the employer has not given 

3

her notice of this Look Policy, so how is she supposed 

4

to in  in  intrude the question, that as far as all 

5

appearances go, it's fine, that she's wearing a 

6

headscarf.  There's no Look Policy that the employee 

7

knows that's violated. 

8
9

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Justice Ginsburg, I 

respectfully disagree with that characterization of what 

10

went on here.  Ms. Elauf knew enough about Abercrombie 

11

to understand that it had a dress code.  Knew enough 

12

about Abercrombie to un  to ask in advance. 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Did she testify that she 

knew they had a dress code?  I was not aware of that. 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

She  she testified that 

16

she knew that she would have to wear Abercrombie style 

17

clothes, that's Joint Appendix 23.  She knew that 

18

Abercrombie did not sell headscarves. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But she did.  In fact, 

she came in with an Abercrombie type shirt, right? 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

She did.  But she also knew 

22

that Abercrombie did not sell headscarves.  That's at 

23

Joint Appendix 3738. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But she asked a friend, 

who worked for Abercrombie whether the  whether the

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

headscarf was a problem, and the friend said, no, if 

2

it's not black, it should be okay.  And in fact, three 

3

of the four managers said it was okay to wear scarves, 

4

so 

5

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It  but 
 why would she suspect 

7

that if she is qualified and has the personality they're 

8

looking for, and is dressed appropriately, that this 

9

company would fail to hire her because they refused to 

10
11

accommodate her religious belief. 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Justice Sotomayor, she asked 

12

a friend who in turn asked another Abercrombie employee, 

13

who was not involved in the hiring process.  And even 

14

the advice that was 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, I think it was a 

store manager. 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

But a store manager who was 

18

not involved in this hiring process.  She had an 

19

opportunity before Ms. Cooke, who interviewed her, to 

20

ask any questions about the Look Policy, after Ms. Cooke 

21

described the Look Policy at the interview.  So 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

She did not mention the 

headscarf? 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Did not mention the 

headscarf.  These Abercrombie interviews, in addition to

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

being group interviews, are scripted interviews in which 

2



3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Show me where in the 

4

script.  Because I remember reading this, and she, in 

5

fact, said we don't discuss the Look Policy at the 

6

interview. 

7

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

If you look at Joint 

8

Appendix 33 and Joint Appendix 100 to 101, that's 

9

Cooke's testimony, that she read a summary of the Look 

10

Policy and gave Ms. Elauf the opportunity to ask any 

11

questions.  Now 

12
13
14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Okay, but there was no 

mention of a headscarf in what she read. 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

It did not specifically 

15

mention the headscarf.  However, it described the Look 

16

Policy in general.  Ms. Elauf knew before, it was a 

17

matter of common sense that Abercrombie requires their 

18

employees to wear clothes that look like Abercrombie 

19

style. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So let's say that somebody 

21

comes in for an interview and this person is  has the 

22

look, if you wanted to, you know, draw the person who 

23

has the look, this is the person who has the look, looks 

24

just like this mythical preppy or 

25

 (Laughter.)

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

 somebody who came off the 

2

beach in California.  Only one problem, the person is 

3

wearing a black blouse, which is against the Abercrombie 

4

rules.  Now, would Abercrombie fire that  or would not 

5

hire that person on the assumption that this person 

6

likes black so much this person is going to wear black 

7

every single day? 

8
9

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

I don't think Abercrombie 

needs to make that assumption about what the person will 

10

do later in order to make a judgment based on the 

11

person's appearance at the interview.  If I walked into 

12

an Abercrombie interview wearing a suit, presumably 

13

Abercrombie could tell me when you come to work, please 

14

don't wear the suit, please wear our clothes.  But it 

15

would also be equally rational for Abercrombie to say, 

16

you know, if this person is coming in wearing a suit, 

17

that's not compatible with our style.  And likewise for 

18

the headscarf.  Johnson's testimony, which the EEOC 

19

didn't challenge, is that he would have taken the same 

20

action for somebody who came into an interview wearing a 

21

headscarf, a baseball cap, a helmet or another religious 

22

symbol. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Or a yarmulke.  He said 

24

specifically, somebody come in, applies for a job, wears 

25

a yarmulke , no questions asked, that violates our policy.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

That was his testimony. 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

That's right, and what that 

3

shows is that religion is not the basis for the action 

4

here, rather, Abercrombie at most was completely 

5

indifferent to 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, but that doesn't 

7

work in a case like this.  It's not a question, are you 

8

treating everybody the same.  You have an obligation to 

9

accommodate people with particular religious practice or 

10

beliefs, so to keep constantly saying, oh, we would have 

11

treated somebody with a baseball cap the same way 

12

doesn't seem to me is very responsive. 

13

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Mr. Chief Justice, for 

14

purposes of an intentional discrimination claim, it does 

15

matter that you would treat everybody the same, and 

16

that's the theory the EEOC is pursuing here. 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no, no, but as I 

18

understand it, it's intentional discrimination because 

19

you failed to accommodate. 

20

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

And I would submit that that 

21

is an incomprehensible understanding of what intentional 

22

discrimination means.  Intentional discrimination 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Again, how we get into all 

24

that, if you want to add something to it, it seems we're 

25

in a kind of minutia.  What's wrong with saying if he

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

correctly believes that she's religious and needs 

2

accommodation, fine, that's the end of it.  You're in 

3

the statute and prove an excuse.  Correct belief can 

4

arise in a thousand contexts.  Did he correctly believe 

5

that the drug that was being sold, that white powder, 

6

was heroin?  Did the manager whom you're trying to fire 

7

and is saying you did, did he correctly believe that, in 

8

fact  or didn't pay enough for college graduates?  Did 

9

he correctly believe that this applicant graduated from 

10

Princeton?  Did he  that's Abercrombie  did he 

11

correctly believe that  that he had authority under 

12

the  under the delegation of agency, to sign a check? 

13

 I mean, look, there are thousands of things. 

14

What's  why is it our job here to say what the right 

15

way of proving correct belief is?  I mean, I think, we 

16

can say it's something wrong.  You don't have to 

17

formulate your correct belief just because she told you. 

18

I mean, you can argue that one.  That's the only way to 

19

prove it and I'm open to that argument, I'd like to hear 

20

it. 

21

 But once we're beyond that, if I'm right 

22

that that isn't the only way you can prove correct 

23

belief, why do we have to say? 

24
25

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Because, Your Honor, in this 

particular context, having a standard like correct

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

belief or suspecting a possible conflict will inevitably 

2

lead employers 

3
4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm with you with 

"suspect." 

5

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That is  suspect 
I'm with you only where 

7

they correctly believe that, dah, dah, dah, or 

8

understand dah, dah, dah, or no.  Those three things 

9

seem good enough to me. 

10

 Now, I've repeated this three times, but I 

11

want to hear the answer why they're not good enough. 

12

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

The  the reason they're 

13

not  Justice Breyer, the reason that they're not good 

14

enough is that there is no way that the employer can 

15

know about a religious practice unless it either 

16

unless it is  that information is traceable to the 

17

employee.  And having that kind of a correct belief 

18

standard will inevitably lead employers to stereotype, 

19

because a factfinder might later find that they short 

20



21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, isn't that 

22

isn't that what Ms. Cooke says she did?  She said she 

23

saw her in a scarf and that she assumed that it was worn 

24

because of religious beliefs, so she acted on a 

25

stereotype that some, I guess, if you wear a black

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

scarf, it's because of a religious belief. 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Your Honor, I don't believe 

3

that she acted on that stereotype.  I believe that 

4

Johnson instructed her not to hire Ms. Elauf because she 

5

was not compliant with the Look Policy. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, he hired her because 

7

 didn't hire her because, under the Look Policy, he 

8

believed you could not accommodate that religious 

9

belief. 

10

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12
13

I think the 
Or that religious 

practice. 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

I think the reason that he 

14

didn't hire her, Joint Appendix 134, is that she simply 

15

was not compliant with the Look Policy. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  So  so the 

17

traceable  now you've got me sort of interested in 

18

this  it seems to me, when you mean traceable to the 

19

woman, I mean, you mean it loosely, I guess. 

20

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I 
It's pretty hard to think 

22

of a case where it wouldn't be.  I mean, I guess I could 

23

imagine a case that he found out about this woman from 

24

an FBI agent who was making it up.  But, I mean, that 

25

just seems very, very unlikely.

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

The case that the government 

2

gives as an example is one in which an employer learned 

3

of an applicant's religious practice from the 

4

employer's  from the applicant's reference who was 

5

the applicant's 

6
7
8
9
10
11
12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And the applicant's 

reference didn't know the applicant? 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

The applicant's reference 

did know the applicant? 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  There it is, 

traceable to the 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

And so that is traceable to 

13

the  to the applicant.  But the problem with  the 

14

problem would be 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What's the difference in 

16

your  I mean, I'm a little  I'm still very confused. 

17

You don't think that there could ever be discrimination 

18

based on a general neutral policy, because what does it 

19

matter if she told him that this was because of 

20

religious belief?  If he's only firing her or not hiring 

21

her because of the Look Policy, then he hasn't 

22

discriminated. 

23

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

No, Your Honor.  If she had 

24

told him, this is for religious belief and I need an 

25

accommodation from the Look Policy, at that point, under

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the statute, there would be a duty to accommodate.  But 

2

the question here is do we want to put 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I am so totally 

4

confused.  So he hears it from Ms. Cooke and that's not 

5

enough? 

6

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

That's right.  Because 

7

Ms. Cooke herself testified that she did not know that 

8

Ms. Elauf wore the headscarf for religious reasons. 

9

What we want to avoid is a rule that leads employers, in 

10

order to avoid liability, to start stereotyping about 

11

whether they think, guess or suspect that somebody is 

12

doing something for religious reasons. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

We've already gone 

14

through this.  All I have to do is say, This is what our 

15

Look Policy is, do you have any problem with it?  As 

16

Justice Alito pointed out a while back, don't have to 

17

probe anything about religion.  I thought Ms.  what is 

18

his name, Johnson  when he said, I would do the same 

19

thing with a man who came in with a yarmulke .  So the man 

20

who came in with the yarmulke   got the same treatment. 

21

Sorry, I was, I was  Ms. Cooke, I would want to hire 

22

you, but I can't.  That was the answer that he gave.  So 

23

there's no difference between the headscarf or yarmulke 

24

or a Sikh turban in Mr. Johnson's view. 

25

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

That  that's right.  And

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to answer your question about why the employer can't 

2

just disclose the policy, that isn't a solution, because 

3

that is asking employers to treat applicants differently 

4

based on stereotypes or assumption about whether 

5

something is likely a religious practice. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

If it's going to be a 

7

requirement for the job, then doesn't the employer have 

8

an obligation to tell the employee what the job 

9

requirements are? 

10

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

No, Your Honor, not under 

11

Title VII.  Title VII is not a Civil Service statute 

12

that requires applicants or employees who violate 

13

workplace rules to be given a chance to explain 

14

themselves and told all of the requirements before 

15

adverse action is taken against them. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This is what I don't 

17

understand about your position with respect to this 

18

particular case.  As I understand it, Abercrombie does 

19

not have a policy that the  that an interviewee must 

20

comply with the Look Policy; is that correct? 

21
22
23

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

The Look Policy itself does 

not apply at the interview.  It seems that Mr. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So what  on  there would 

24

be no reason for not hiring the individual involved here 

25

unless you assumed that she was going to wear a scarf

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

every day.  Just because she wore a headscarf on that 

2

one day, wouldn't mean that she necessarily was going to 

3

wear it everyday.  Every day she might.  Maybe she's 

4

just having a bad hair day so she comes in with a 

5

headscarf, but she doesn't have any religious reason for 

6

doing it.  Would you reject her for that?  No.  The 

7

reason that she was rejected was because you assumed she 

8

was going to do this every day and the only reason why 

9

she would do it every day is because she had a religious 

10
11

reason. 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Justice Alito, that has not 

12

been the EEOC's theory of this case.  And if it had 

13

been, there would have been ways that they could have 

14

tried to prove that.  They could have questioned Johnson 

15

specifically about that.  What would he have done if 

16

somebody had come in wearing a ball cap?  They could 

17

have tried to get comparative evidence about what would 

18

happened when people came in wearing nonreligious head 

19

wear.  And so the EEOC's theory, which it had every 

20

opportunity to prove, has not been that Johnson 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why would they ask 

22

anything about nonreligious?  Title VII doesn't require 

23

accommodating baseball caps, but it does require 

24

accommodating to religious practices.  So the employer 

25

is not  as I said before, it's not just, I can't

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discriminate on the basis of religion, but if there's a 

2

religious practice, I must accommodate it as a discrete 

3

requirement. 

4

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

The  the premise of 

5

Justice Alito's question, as I understood it, is that 

6

Abercrombie only didn't hire this person because the 

7

headscarf was religious.  And what I'm suggesting is, 

8

Abercrombie might well not have hired anybody who walked 

9

in wearing any head cover covering.  And so if the EEOC 

10

had wanted to prove the role that assumptions about 

11

religion supposedly 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So why would that be so 

13

when you just said they don't require people at the 

14

interview stage to conform to the Look Policy? 

15

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

On its face, the Look Policy 

16

itself does not require that.  But Johnson, the 

17

decision maker here, in effect was judging people based 

18

on 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You were about to tell us 

20

what the EEOC's theory of the case was.  I was eager to 

21

hear that.  Could you tell us what you think their 

22

theory of the case was? 

23

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

I think their theory of the 

24

case was that there was a duty to accommodate a 

25

religious practice anytime an employer has a correct

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

understanding or a suspicion of that practice.  It has 

2

not  the theory has not been that Abercrombie acted 

3

based on assumptions about Ms. Elauf's religion.  And I 

4

think one way in which we know that is, let's assume 

5

that the Look Policy did apply at the interview.  Under 

6

the EEOC's theory, if an interviewer suspected that the 

7

applicant  or correctly understood, as Justice Breyer 

8

prefers  correctly understood that the applicant wore 

9

the headscarf for religious purposes, at that point, 

10
11

there would be a duty to accommodate. 
 Regardless of whether Abercrombie did or did 

12

not make any assumptions about future compliance, if the 

13

Look Policy applied at the interview, there would be a 

14

duty to accommodate upon that correct understanding at 

15

the interview. 

16

 The problem with that rule is that 

17

employers, in order to protect themselves in the future 

18

from having a jury find that they must have correctly 

19

understood that a particular 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

between that and having no 

22

25

So what's the difference 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand what you 

were about to say.  Would you finish your thought? 
 MR. DVORETZKY: 

The only way that employers 

can protect themselves under the EEOC's approach is by

51

Alderson Reporting Company

1

training their managers to stereotype about possible 

2

religious beliefs because a judge or jury might later 

3

find that Abercrombie or an employer correctly 

4

understood, or must have correctly understood, under an 

5

objective test which they don't disclaim in their amici 

6

briefs. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But you're essentially 

8

saying that the problem with the rule is that it 

9

requires Abercrombie to engage in what might be thought 

10

of as an awkward conversation, to ask some questions. 

11

Now, people can disagree about whether one can ask those 

12

questions in a way that's awkward at all, but you're 

13

saying we should structure the whole legal system to 

14

make sure that there is no possibility of that awkward 

15

conversation ever taking place.  But the alternative to 

16

that rule is a rule where Abercrombie just gets to say, 

17

we're going to stereotype people and prevent them from 

18

getting jobs.  We'll never have the awkward conversation 

19

because we're just going to cut these people out and 

20

make sure that they never become Abercrombie employees. 

21

 Now, between those two options, the option 

22

of using a stereotype to make sure that somebody never 

23

gets a job and using a stereotype to have an awkward 

24

conversation, which does this statute seem to think is 

25

the worst problem?

52

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Justice Kagan, the problem 

2

is not having awkward conversations.  The problem is 

3

that the EEOC's rule would lead employers to treat 

4

people differently based on their religion, which is 

5

precisely the opposite of what Title VII wants.  The 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

They  Title VII 

7

requires them to treat people who have religious 

8

practice differently.  They don't have to accommodate a 

9

baseball cap.  They do have to accommodate a yarmulke. 

10

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

But Title VII requires that 

11

only after  as the EEOC has said for 40 years  only 

12

after the employee or applicant places religion on the 

13

table.  Title VII does not want employers to be making 

14

those judgments before the employee raises the issue. 

15

And the concern that the EEOC raises here, that we're 

16

going to have applicants who are completely in the dark 

17

about work policies, has not been borne out by any 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  I got you.  Is this 

19

right?  I've got, I think, your argument.  Your argument 

20

is it may sound odd to want a special rule as to when 

21

you have belief or so forth, but for administrative 

22

reasons, we have to have it.  There are millions of 

23

people who are practicing one religion or another where 

24

you get a clue of that from their name or maybe their 

25

dress or whatever it is.  And whenever we have such a

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

person applying, if she doesn't say anything or he 

2

doesn't say anything, and we don't hire them or we don't 

3

do it, we're going to get sued.  And we don't want all 

4

those lawsuits.  And it isn't that big a burden to say 

5

to the person who wants the accommodation, tell us. 

6

 We get into some administrative rule about 

7

how to elicit it from her without that simple rule, tell 

8

us, we're going to be in a real administrative rat mess 

9

getting sued left right and center.  Have I got the 

10

essence of your argument? 

11

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

13

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

That's right. 
Okay. 
And even asking the 

14

neutralsounding sort of question, can you comply with 

15

the work rule, even that, is treating applicants 

16

differently based on 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, that isn't the end of 

18

the world, perhaps.  But you would say, look, we  we 

19

have thousands of managers and  and goodness knows 

20

they're going to get  start getting resentful and dah, 

21

dah, dah, dah.  I mean, I just want to be sure I've got 

22

the argument. 

23

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

That  that is essence of 

24

it.  But part of the reason that I think this is very 

25

significant is that under the EEOC's own regulations, if

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the applicant  if the employer asks the 

2

neutralsounding question and then chooses not to hire 

3

the person for a religion  for a reason completely 

4

unrelated to religion, the EEOC will infer that there 

5

was discrimination 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Frankly, this is such an 

7

unusual case because it's very rare that you have an 

8

interviewer like Ms. Cooke who's honest.  And the only 

9

reason there was a suit here was because she was honest 

10

and came in and told someone else.  But if this young 

11

this young woman wasn't about to sue until she heard 

12

this information.  Most people don't presume they're not 

13

hired because of some religious practice.  But if you 

14

have a policy that conflicts with your religious 

15

practice, and the person knows you're going to wear a 

16

yarmulke, then you might get sued. 

17

 MR. DVORETZKY: 

Your Honor, I think many, if 

18

not almost all Title VII cases do originate without any 

19

sort of admission by the employer about what the reason 

20

was for not hiring the individual.  And I think that the 

21

rule that places a burden on employers to stereotype and 

22

to raise these sorts of issues is one that will 

23

undermine the purposes of Title VII.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice: 
 I'd like to make just two quick factual 

6

points to clear up what I see to be some confusion in 

7

the record. 

8

 First of all, there was some discussion 

9

about whether, in fact, you needed to comply with the 

10

Look Policy.  I point the Court to 94(a), which the 

11

which the district court says  94(a) of the Petition 

12

Appendix  the policy applies to all store employees, 

13

but applicants are not required to be in compliance at 

14

the time of the interview. 

15

 There was some question about whether Cooke 

16

knew or didn't know about the headscarf.  It is crystal 

17

clear that she did not know.  The district court said it 

18

is undisputed  I'm sorry, that Elauf did or did not 

19

know  it is undisputed  this is at 97(a) of the 

20

court's opinion  it is undisputed that Cooke did not 

21

tell her that Abercrombie would not permit models to 

22

wear headscarves or to wear black clothing. 

23

 The Look Policy script, should the Court 

24

wish to look at it, is Plaintiff's Exhibit 4 in the 

25

trial.  It quotes what the Look Policy is.  I will

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

caution that it is not in the summary judgment record, 

2

it was admitted in the damages trial.  But the Look 

3

Policy is there and consistent with all of the 

4

testimony, it does not mention headscarves. 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Do you want to say a word 

about what I called his administrative argument? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I would. 

8

I think the administrative argument actually cuts in our 

9

sense  in our favor in a couple of ways.  First of 

10

all, the suggestion that there are practical problems 

11

isn't plausible.  This has been the rule for two 

12

decades.  The Ninth Circuit, the Third Circuit, the 

13

Seventh Circuit, everybody is applying the same test. 

14

It's the Tenth Circuit that for the first time has 

15

imposed these two new requirements. 

16

 Second, I don't think it's unadministrable 

17

for exactly the reasons we talked about in my first time 

18

up here.  An employer can structure an interview to make 

19

sure that critical rules are followed, and the employer, 

20

if it wants, can make no assumptions about religion. 

21

 Justice Sotomayor, if I could pick up on 

22

your point.  I think what's important about this case 

23

and why we think it's important, is precisely that it is 

24

unusual.  What is unusual is that the applicant found 

25

out why she was not hired, and that is what's strange.

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Most of the time, the person just never finds out that 

2

no accommodation was made, that the employer assumed the 

3

accommodation was  would be needed and just never 

4

told.  And it's precisely why we 

5

lawsuit, of course.  I mean 

7
8

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13
14
15

She can sue and then find 

out in the  in the course of discovery, right? 

11
12

It doesn't, Your Honor, 

but 

9
10

That doesn't prevent a 

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

They certainly could, but 


 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And it happens often, 

doesn't it? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

No, Your Honor, I'm not 

16

sure that it does.  And I think this is what makes this 

17

a very important case.  It's because most applicants 

18

unlike employees, who are in a position to go back and 

19

forth with their employer and understand the work rules, 

20

applicants are at a serious informational disadvantage. 

21

They don't know the work rules.  And in this case, it is 

22

undisputed that she did not. 

23

 And if I could just close then, picking up 

24

on something Justice Kagan was pointing at, that the 

25

background rule in Title VII is that belief is

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sufficient.  But what makes this case, we think, 


2


particularly strong, is that this is belief plus an 


3


assumption that  where they acted on that belief and 

4

they assumed that she would need an accommodation from 

5

the work rule.  That is certainly sufficient and the 

6

Tenth Circuit was wrong to conclude otherwise. 

7

 Thank you.
