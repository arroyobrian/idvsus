 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

argument next in Case 137211, Jennings v. Stephens. 
 Mr. Schaffer. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. RANDOLPH SCHAFFER, JR. 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court. 
 Ninety years ago, this Court held in 

11

American Railway that an appellee need not crossappeal 

12

to raise an argument in support of the judgment that 

13

does not seek to enlarge his rights.  Petitioner, who 

14

prevailed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim 

15

in the district court, did not have to crossappeal here 

16

for two reasons. 

17

 First, he did not seek more relief than the 

18

new punishment hearing granted to him in this  in the 

19

judgment. 

20

 Second, he raised an argument that the 

21

district court rejected as an alternate basis to affirm 

22

the judgment, and if he did not need to crossappeal, he 

23

did not need a COA. 

24

 We made 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  He  I

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't know if this is a new argument or a new issue. 

2

And the reason I raise that is when the judgment issued 

3

here by the district court, it specified two errors that 

4

had occurred and basically told the State court, fix 

5

those two or you have to release the defendant. 

6

 Let's assume they fixed those two, and then 

7

could you come back and say release him anyway because 

8

they didn't fix the third that I lost on? 

9
10
11
12

 MR. SCHAFFER: 
circumstances. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

So how is it not more 

relief? 

13

15

No, not under those 

I beg your pardon? 
How is it not more 

relief or different relief? 
 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Because the single error is 

17

that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. 

18

That is a single claim, and it was based on three 

19

allegations of deficient performance. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, now, wait a minute. 

21

I  you know, I have  we  we don't evaluate whether 

22

you had good counsel or bad counsel.  You may have 

23

Clarence Darrow and still be denied effective assistance 

24

of counsel if Clarence Darrow makes one mistake.  I 

25

mean, when  when we find that there has been

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ineffective assistance of counsel, I think that means 

2

counsel failed to do one thing that he should have done. 

3

But there's  there's no such general finding that 

4

counsel was  was, in gross, ineffective. 

5

 You're  you're  you're describing it as 

6

though  as though that's what the finding is.  That 

7

that's not what we hold when we find ineffective 

8

assistance of counsel.  We find that this particular 

9

counsel made this mistake.  That's it. 

10

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Well, let's take that a step 

11

further.  What the Court does to analyze an IAC claim is 

12

to first isolate the errors of counsel.  It could be 

13

one; it could be a hundred.  It doesn't matter.  You 

14

accumulate them and consider them together to determine 

15

prejudice. 

16

 If the deficiencies in performance 

17

constitute sufficient prejudice to undermine confidence 

18

in the verdict, then counsel was constitutionally 

19

ineffective, not because of A, B, C, or D, but because 

20

the totality of his representation did not meet the 

21

constitutional standard. 

22

 So it's not a matter of fixing any 

23

particular error of counsel.  And that's where I believe 

24

the  the State's position is a little awry because a 

25

Federal court judgment in a habeas case is different

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

than a direct appeal judgment.  On a direct appeal 

2

judgment, the  the court tells the district court, 

3

We're sending the case back to you, do A, B, C, and D or 

4

don't do X, Y, and Z. 

5

 A Federal habeas judgment is a lawsuit 

6

against the warden having to do with the body of the 

7

prisoner.  The Federal court doesn't have authority to 

8

tell the State to do or not do any particular thing. 

9

The effect of the Federal court judgment is to basically 

10

say release the prisoner unless within, in our case, 120 

11

days you resentence him to life or you give a new 

12

punishment hearing. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Would your argument be the 

14

same if all of the claims in this case were not 

15

ineffective assistance of counsel claims?  Let's take an 

16

example that's in the briefs 

17

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO:  where there's 

Sure. 

19

ineffective assistance  of  there's a ineffective 

20

assistance of counsel claim and there's a coerced 

21

confession claim.  And so the  the petitioner wins on 

22

the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, loses in 

23

the district court on the coerced confession claim.  The 

24

judgment is that he's entitled to resentencing or, let's 

25

say, it's resentencing due to the ineffective assistance

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of counsel, but there will be not be the opportunity to 

2

introduce  to exclude the coerced confession.  So would 

3

you  does your argument apply in that situation as 

4

well? 

5

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Assuming the coerced 

6

confession involves the punishment phase as opposed to 

7

the guilt/innocence phase. 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The same phase, yes. 

9

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Okay.  I think that's a 

10

situation where the State has a decent argument that 

11

because it's a different claim, that would perhaps 

12

entitle you to more relief under the judgment, that is, 

13

not just a new punishment hearing, but a new punishment 

14

hearing without the unconstitutional confession, that on 

15

the state of the law today, I would file a crossappeal 

16

and move for a COA on a separate claim because I think 

17

that would be Pfeiffer, Alexander, El Paso Natural Gas, 

18

where you're seeking to modify the judgment and obtain 

19

more relief than it would be American Railway. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22
23

If you say that 
Well, why do you  go 

ahead.  Sorry. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if I  yeah, just a 

24

followup on that.  If you say that, could not the same 

25

situation arise with respect to different ineffective

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

assistance of counsel claims? 

2

 Let's say that in this case, you won on your 

3

Spisak claim, things that were said during the closing. 

4

You lost on the Wiggins claim.  Let's say the Wiggins 

5

claim was that there was money available from the 

6

court  from the State to hire experts, but the 

7

attorney didn't apply for the money, didn't do an 

8

investigation, that was ineffective assistance of 

9

counsel.  So if you win on the  on the Spisak claim, 

10

you'll  you'll get a new sentencing hearing, 

11

presumably, free from the errors in the closing, but you 

12

won't get the opportunity to  to go back and do the 

13

time or the money to  to do the investigation. 

14

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

I would respectfully disagree 

15

with that.  Because if you get a new sentencing hearing, 

16

you get to do whatever you want to do at the new 

17

sentencing hearing.  And for our purposes, if you now 

18

know for  in Federal court that the lawyer didn't 

19

investigate mental history and discover X, Y, and Z, you 

20

now know it. 

21
22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

they say, well, that  you lost that claim. 

23

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

25

But on  on remand, they 

No.  It 
You lost it, so there's 

no  there's no need for more money.  There's no need

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for more time.  Let's do it over with what  you know, 

2

with a  with a proper closing. 

3

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

And that's the thing.  The 

4

Federal habeas judgment cannot direct the State court 

5

what to do or not do at a retrial.  All it can do is 

6

tell them we're releasing this person unless the 

7

constitutional error is fixed. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that's not true. 

It  it can tell them what to do.  The  the basis on 

10

which the conviction was set aside cannot be repeated by 

11

the State court.  You're  you're saying that the State 

12

court can  is  is free to make the same mistake 

13

again? 

14

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Well, it's actually not me 

15

saying.  It's this Court's opinions have said that on a 

16

Federal habeas judgment does not decide what a State 

17

court may do or not do on remand.  We just direct them 

18

to fix the constitutional error.  We don't tell them how 

19

to do it. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but  but once you 

21

say we direct them to fix the constitutional error, that 

22

is something that they have to do on remand, isn't it? 

23

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Or  or the Federal court 

24

will release the prisoner. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Fix that constitutional

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

error. 

2

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Correct. 
But this other 

4

constitutional error, which we didn't rule on in the 

5

habeas thing, they don't have to fix.  It's up to them. 

6

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

But let's remember, in an IAC 

7

claim, it's different than a freestanding admission or 

8

exclusion of evidence claim because a Federal court 

9

habeas judgment cannot  for example, in this case, the 

10

State says, we sought to enlarge our rights under the 

11

judgment by asking the Federal court to order the State 

12

to fix any closing argument error and require a new 

13

trial free of this error. 

14

 We didn't ask that. 

We could not have asked 

15

that.  A Federal court cannot order a State court to fix 

16

any error of defense counsel or tell defense counsel how 

17

to try the case, what to offer, what not to offer, what 

18

arguments to make.  All the Court can do is provide a 

19

remedy for the petitioner if he does not have effective 

20

counsel at the retrial. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

new  a new trial. 

23

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

And that remedy is a 

Or a new punishment. 
What if  what 

if  what if one claim is the ineffective assistance

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and the other claim is a violation of the confrontation 

2

clause? 

3

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Separate. 
And you  and 

5

you  when  when you go back, they can repeat the 

6

error or they can choose not to call their witness, 

7

either way.  And it would seem to me that if you didn't 

8

file a crossappeal, that the Federal court decision 

9

would be an advisory opinion on the confrontation 

10
11

clause. 
 MR. SCHAFFER: 

And so in that circumstance, 

12

if you were seeking additional relief, i.e., keep out 

13

the non 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

15

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Right. 

 constitutional admission 

16

of evidence, then in that situation, I would file a 

17

crossappeal and move for a COA because I would be 

18

seeking to enlarge my rights under the judgment. 

19

 The judgment that we got here didn't really 

20

give us anything more than the Constitution gives any 

21

citizen the day that he walks into a courtroom, which is 

22

the right to a trial with the effective assistance of 

23

counsel. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, no, no, no.  The  the 

right to a trial that did not have this  this failure

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of counsel, this particular failure.  You're not 

2

entitled to  to competent counsel.  You're  you're 

3

entitled to counsel who doesn't make a mistake.  He 

4

could be the dumbest counsel around so long as he 

5

doesn't make a mistake.  And he could be the smartest 

6

around, and if he does make a mistake, that's 

7

ineffective assistance of counsel. 

8
9

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Respectfully, it's not by 

itself.  The mistakes may be mistakes, but unless the 

10

totality of those mistakes constitute sufficient 

11

prejudice to undermine confidence in the verdict 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But was that an issue here? 

13

I mean, I  I  looking at the blue brief and the 

14

and the red brief, it seemed to me that the issues here 

15

have turned on a mistake, how many mistakes are there. 

16

It wasn't a question of prejudice.  That is, the lower 

17

court said, even if you're  if you're right  and 

18

they thought you were right 

19

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21
22

Correct. 
 that these two errors in 

failing to investigate the background created prejudice. 
 So I don't think there was an argument on 

23

appeal about whether there was enough prejudice.  It was 

24

a question of was this a mistake. 

25

 Am I right or not?

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Well, my position on appeal 

was I'm 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, I know.  I'm just 

4

saying was there an argument about that?  Did they 

5

disagree about that? 

6
7
8
9

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

I think the State certainly 

disagreed with 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Did they  and they argued 

that before the court. 

10

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

They  they disagreed 
They said even if their 

12

they said the issue before the  the Fifth Circuit is 

13

whether all together these three things amount to 

14

prejudice because our view of the State's view was, all 

15

right, even if there were errors here, it didn't amount 

16

to prejudice? 

17

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

What they basically said is 

18

that the district court didn't defer to the State court 

19

findings and conclusions regarding those matters. 

20
21
22

 So  but let's  let's play the State's 
argument out to its logical conclusion. 
 Under their theory, let's assume the same 

23

thing happened to the district court.  We win on 

24

A and B, we lose on C, and they say we're not going to 

25

appeal.  Go back to State court, we'll give you a trial,

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and you can introduce the evidence of alleged mental 

2

deficits and disadvantaged background.  We'll give you a 

3

chance to save your guy's life by laying it all out to a 

4

jury and letting them decide. 

5

 And I say, nope, I'm going to appeal the 

6

closing argument to the circuit.  And so I file a notice 

7

of appeal and move for a COA.  And the district court 

8

let's see how that would play out.  The district judge 

9

would say, did you read my opinion?  You won.  Why do 

10

you need a COA?  Why do you want to take this up?  And I 

11

would say, Judge, because I need an order for you to 

12

tell me that I cannot argue to a jury that I would agree 

13

with the death sentence.  I need that order to keep me 

14

from doing that.  And the judge would say:  You are out 

15

of your mind; COA denied. 

16

 I would appeal to the circuit. 

The State 

17

would take the exact opposite position they are taking 

18

here.  They would say this is a frivolous appeal, he 

19

got all the relief he wanted in the judgment, which is a 

20

new punishment hearing, he doesn't have the right to 

21

appeal this, this is an example of death row inmates 

22

abusing the system and filing frivolous appeals to delay 

23

things. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The predicate of the 

argument is that again that ineffective assistance of 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

counsel claims are different.  You wouldn't think that it 

2

was crazy in the situation where you've got the ineffective 

3

assistance of counsel claim and the coerced confession 

4

claim.  You win on the ineffective assistance of counsel 

5

claim, they don't reach the coerced confession claim or 

6

the confrontation clause claim.  It wouldn't be crazy 

7

for you to appeal the loss on either of those things 

8

because if you don't get relief on that then you are 

9

going to have the same thing when you go back, right? 

10

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

That's right.  And in that 

11

situation I would be seeking to enlarge my rights under 

12

the judgment by having evidence excluded at a retrial 

13

that's beyond the scope of the judgment.  In this case 

14

the judgment gave me everything I wanted.  There is not 

15

a word in that judgment that's adverse to me.  There's 

16

not a thing I could have asked for. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The argument is that what 

18

the judgment was is the relief that you got is a new 

19

sentencing hearing shorn of the particular errors the 

20

district court found and those particular errors did not 

21

relate to the Spisak or closing argument.  So you are 

22

trying to say we had a judgment, we won, and ordinarily a 

23

judgment winner can appeal if they won and if there is an 

24

argument that was made on which the judgment won or 

25

lost, that is not preclusive because he didn't have a

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

chance to appeal.  A judgment winner can't appeal.  But 

2

this is peculiar because the  there were  the  the 

3

order is you are entitled to a new trial shorn of these 

4

particular errors.  The court of appeals says they are 

5

not errors.  And then you want to bring up another 

6

error. 

7

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Well, I want to  let's 

8

let's break down the way IAC is analyzed.  The issue in 

9

this case was, was Petitioner  denied the effective 

10

assistance of counsel at the punishment phase.  In the 

11

vernacular, we made an IAC claim.  We made  an IAC 

12

claim, this Court said in Strickland, has two 

13

components:  Deficient performance and prejudice.  We 

14

made three arguments in support of deficient 

15

performance.  We won two; we lost one. 

16

 We won the claim. 

We got the new punishment 

17

hearing.  So at the new punishment hearing  let's 

18

assume we got one, and I was  it doesn't mean I would 

19

have to put on the evidence of mental health history and 

20

disadvantaged background.  I could make a strategic 

21

decision based on the landscape of the retrial what to 

22

use or not use.  So the Federal court order would give 

23

the Petitioner a new punishment hearing, but it would 

24

not dictate to me what evidence I had to put on, what 

25

arguments I had to make, nor could the State or the

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

trial court compel me to do or not do anything.  It 

2

could only provide a remedy if I didn't do it correctly. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But if you fail to put 

4

on the same evidence which the court of appeals had said 

5

the failure to produce constituted ineffective 

6

performance of counsel, if you do the same thing again, 

7

why wouldn't be that ineffective assistance of counsel? 

8
9

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Well, it might or might not 

depending on how the case was retried.  What if, for 

10

example, on the mental  let's just take an example: 

11

The mental health history.  Okay.  The State went out 

12

and got a doctor to controvert the opinions of our 

13

doctors.  What if I decided at the retrial, you know, I 

14

think that getting into this mental health history would 

15

create more harm than good based on what the State's 

16

doctor is going to say.  I'm not going to put that on, 

17

I'm just going to go with the disadvantaged background 

18

and argue that they haven't proven future dangerousness 

19

because he's got no history of violence when he is 

20

incarcerated.  I could make that strategic decision.  If 

21

somebody wanted to come along later and grade my papers, 

22

they could, and they could say it was thumbs up or 

23

thumbs down as the case may be. 

24

 Let's examine the State's argument 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now, you couldn't put  if

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all things otherwise were the same, you couldn't do what 

2

the lawyer did here without being ineffective 

3

assistance.  That's what  isn't that their holding, 

4

the holding of the district court?  The district court 

5

says the lawyer in these circumstances did not give 

6

effective assistance as to two things.  So of course 

7

things could change in the new trial, and then you could 

8

act differently, but if they didn't change, you would 

9

have to do  act  what the district court said, 

10
11

wouldn't you? 
 MR. SCHAFFER: 

I would agree with regard to 

12

the evidence of disadvantaged background, because that 

13

is written in stone.  That doesn't change. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Now, once that 

15

is so, there is nothing in the order that would, things 

16

being identical, stop the prosecutor from making 

17

precisely the same remarks that you are challenging.

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 there is nothing in the 

2

order that would prevent the lawyer from doing precisely 

3

the same thing.  There is something in the order that 

4

would prevent you from doing the same first two things, 

5

other things being precisely equal. 

6

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

If I may, let's look at the 

7

mental health history for a moment.  The mental health 

8

history was not even known by the trial lawyer.  Okay? 

9

So if he was ineffective, he was ineffective based on a 

10
11

Wiggins failure to investigate type of situation. 
 That's a different question. 

Let's assume 

12

he had investigated and he found the same things that I 

13

found during habeas, and he decided not to put it 

14

on.  Then it would be a strategic decision which he 

15

would have to defend.  And so that's where we come back, 

16

because that evidence was never known 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But why are we talking 

18

about the claim on which you lost on appeal?  You are 

19

not going to get a chance to go back with disadvantaged, 

20

with mental health, because you lost on those on appeal. 

21

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

23
24
25

I don't think 
I thought the Wiggins 

claims were rejected on appeal. 
 MR. SCHAFFER: 

They were.  But let's play 

this  let's assume that we get merits review on the

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

closing argument.  And remember, it's not a claim, in my 

2

view.  It's an argument in support of a claim.  And I 

3

think that the key portion of the government's 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

5

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

May I just clarify it? 
Sure. 
Everything that you are 

7

arguing rides on our treating ineffective assistance of 

8

counsel as one claim rather than ineffective assistance 

9

of counsel, confrontation clause, some other violation. 

10

If we don't buy your argument that ineffective 

11

assistance of counsel is one monolithic claim and we 

12

think the division between what they  what they're 

13

calling Wiggins error and the  those 

14

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

16

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

The two Spisak claims. 
 you would lose. 
I disagree.  I don't think 

17

you even need to reach the issue of is IAC one claim or 

18

not.  It's here because they've split my claim into 

19

thirds by saying I made three claims instead of one.  I 

20

can still win under a pure interpretation of American 

21

Railway because I am not seeking greater relief than 

22

what I got in the judgment, which is a new punishment 

23

hearing.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

With that in mind, I want 

Sure. 
Let's assume that we 

18

accept your argument that you did not have to file a 

19

separate notice of appeal. 

20

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Okay. 
Does that mean that you 

22

automatically comply with the COA?  Because the COA 

23

statute says that a certificate of appeal 

24

appealability must show that the applicant has made a 

25

substantial showing.  And you've conceded that all

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

aspects of the incompetence of counsel go to 

2

substantiality, so why is it that you have complied with 

3

the COA statute? 

4

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I haven't complied 
And the under  and the 

6

overlying question is once you  if you were to 

7

convince us that no notice of appeal was required, does 

8

it automatically follow that you are not required to 

9

have a COA? 

10

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

I think that's the key issue. 

11

The rule I propose, that I think is based on the statute 

12

and the  and the text of the rules, is if you need to 

13

crossappeal, you need a COA.  If you do not need to 

14

crossappeal, you don't need a COA.  And let me give you 

15

two  let me hit the government's arguments headon, 

16

and I think this is key. 

17

 They say the COA requirement should be read 

18

into the statute or adopted as a matter of Federal 

19

common law.  That is a tacit acknowledgment that the 

20

statute does not require a COA for the nonappealing 

21

petitioner appellee.  In their brief, they do not rely 

22

on the text of 2253(c) or the associated rules, 

23

FRAP 22(b), or Habeas Rule 11(a).  They want you all 

24

to  the Court to read that into the statute.  And that 

25

is not appropriate where the text is clear, where

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

Congress 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Are you saying that the 

3

COA statute itself says you need a COA to appeal from 

4

the final order and you don't want to appeal from the 

5

final order because you like the final order? 

6

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Well, correct  in part 

7

correct.  2253(c) says a COA is required for an appeal 

8

to be taken to the court of appeals.  Now, we know that 

9

doesn't apply to the government for two reasons.  First, 

10

under (c)(2) a governmental entity could never show the 

11

denial of a Federal constitutional right.  Secondly, 

12

under FRAP 22(b)(3) the government is expressly 

13

excluded.  So if it doesn't apply to the government, who 

14

does it apply to?  Who did Congress intend for 2253(c) 

15

to apply to? 

16

 The answer is clear. 

Petitionerappellants 

17

who take the appeal, or petitionerappellees who take a 

18

crossappeal. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So why wouldn't you have to 

take a crossappeal? 
 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Because, well, I  that gets 

22

us back to where we were 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's the same problem, 

24

isn't it?  I mean, do you help yourself by saying, okay, 

25

we need to crossappeal, it only applies there, because

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then we get into exactly the same argument, whether you 

2

need a crossappeal. 

3

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Well, I'd say I don't need to 

4

crossappeal because I'm not seeking to enlarge my 

5

rights in the judgment. 

6
7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 
then 

8

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10

13

 and IAC is a single claim. 
 we're back to the same 

argument.  What? 

11
12

Well, yes, you are, because 

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

IAC is a single claim, and 

I 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Let's assume that we 

14

disagree with you that you needed a crossappeal.  Could 

15

you answer or didn't  or agree with you, you didn't 

16

need a crossappeal. 

17

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

Okay. 
Answer Justice Kennedy's 

question of why you don't need the COA. 

20

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sure. 
Because a crossappeal 

22

doesn't have to make a substantial showing of  of a 

23

denial of a constitutional right. 

24
25

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

A crossappeal is just a 

piece of paper that you file.  It doesn't have to show

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

anything.  It just says I want to appeal.  It's the 

2

COA 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Exactly.  So why are the 

two tied together, in your mind? 
 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Well, because I think when 

6

you read 2253(c) it's clear it applies only to the 

7

petitioner appellant who lost, obviously, on everything 

8

below or the petitioner appellee who lost on a separate 

9

claim that he's now desiring to appeal.  And  and this 

10

is kind of, I think, obvious to me if you look at habeas 

11

Rule 11(a), which says that, "The district court must 

12

issue or deny a COA when it enters a final order adverse 

13

to the applicant."  The applicant is the party taking 

14

the appeal. 

15

 Here the district court did not enter a 

16

final order adverse to me, and I didn't take the appeal. 

17

So you don't reach that part of 11(a) that says if a COA 

18

is required, it has to specify the issue or issues that 

19

satisfy the showing of the denial of the Federal 

20

constitutional right. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you agree that a 

22

petitioner who has to take a crossappeal, because the 

23

petitioner wants to enlarge the judgment, does not have 

24

to get a certificate of appealability? 

25

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

Do I agree that he does or

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

does not? 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

3

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

5

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

6
7

Does not. 
No. 
He has to. 
I think if you take a 

crossappeal, you need a COA. 
 And here's  here's the other thing and I 

8

do want to hit this.  The government  the State says 

9

the COA should be required as a matter of policy to 

10

screen frivolous appeals, and indeed, that's the most 

11

attractive argument they make because what court doesn't 

12

want to screen frivolous appeals. 

13

 I want you to bear in mind, please, that 

14

there's only a few cases each year in which the 

15

petitioner prevails in the district court under the 

16

daunting AEDPA standard of review and the State appeals, 

17

the information we received off of the public databases 

18

that we were able to check.  And so I put an asterisk 

19

next to this, is that in 2013, there were 18 cases in 

20

the Federal circuits that have our scenario where the 

21

petitioner won and the State took the appeal.  So that's 

22

less than 2 per  per circuit.  That's a speck of sand 

23

on the beach of cases. 

24
25

 Where a petitioner prevails in the district 
court under the AEDPA standard of review, that appeal is

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not a frivolous appeal.  The appellate court is going to 

2

have to spend its time on it.  It's serious, especially 

3

in a death penalty case.  And the briefing rules, the 

4

page limits, the fact that the petitioner would have an 

5

incentive to protect his judgment and focus his efforts 

6

on the claim he won would certainly discourage people 

7

from doing what the government says, which is to raise 

8

100 frivolous arguments in response. 

9

 If that were to happen in this speck of sand 

10

number of cases in the appellate courts, I'm totally 

11

confident that the circuit courts can dispose of 

12

frivolous arguments in a sentence, a footnote or a 

13

paragraph like that. 

14

 Before I reserve the rest of my time for 

15

rebuttal, I want you  I don't know whether this Court 

16

appreciates irony, but I suspect that you do, and I 

17

consider it ironic that the State is basically trying to 

18

scare this Court into reading a COA requirement into the 

19

statute for a petitioner appellee under the guise of the 

20

appellate courts being inundated with 100 frivolous 

21

arguments by prevailing petitioners in a case where the 

22

prevailing petitioner raised exactly one argument, and 

23

it comprised 3 pages out of a 53page brief in which the 

24

first 50 pages sought to protect the judgment. 

25

 A final thought. 

If this Court were to rule

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in our favor, I don't see there being any seismic shift 

2

in the Federal habeas landscape.  This case, in the 

3

great scheme of things, is a blip on the Federal habeas 

4

radar.  But if you accept the State's position and rule 

5

in their favor, in my judgment, the Court would have to 

6

find that ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes 

7

separate claims based on the number of allegations of 

8

deficient performance and that cannot be harmonized with 

9

Strickland. 

10

 Under the State's theory, there would be no 

11

circumstances, there would be no case in which the 

12

petitioner appellee did not need to crossappeal and 

13

obtain the COA.  Viewing this in context and boiling it 

14

down to the bottom line, I filed one IAC claim.  I had 

15

one child, and I named him Strickland.  The State cannot 

16

come back now and tell you that I had triplets and their 

17

names are Wiggins I, Wiggins II and Spisak. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In other contexts, however, 

19

IAC is not a unitary concept, is it?  I don't want to 

20

take up your rebuttal time, but in other contexts like 

21

repetitive litigation or exhaustion, IAC is not a 

22

unitary concept. 

23

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

25

Well 
Talk about it on rebuttal if 

you 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

I don't want to get too far 

2

into that, but it's a totally different situation there, 

3

because those cases, Trevino and so forth, they're based 

4

on principles  principles of federalism and comity. 

5

It's not a lack of jurisdiction.  It's that the Court 

6

can decide to excuse some procedural default based on 

7

cause and prejudice.  In our case, it's a pure question 

8

of appellate court jurisdiction.  Does the court of 

9

appeals have jurisdiction to rule on an argument in 

10

support of ineffective assistance where I've already won 

11

on the claim?  All I'm asking them to do is consider the 

12

argument as an alternate basis to affirm the judgment of 

13

the district court. 

14

 And for that reason, this Court should 

15

reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and remand for 

16

consideration of the closing argument on the merits.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW S. OLDHAM 

23
24
25

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. OLDHAM: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court:

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 It's now common ground that Petitioner would 

2

need to crossappeal to add some conditions to a 

3

conditional release order issued by the district court. 

4

The only question in this case now is whether the 

5

particular condition requested by this particular 

6

Petitioner was necessary or sufficient to add to the 

7

conditional release order, and we think that it was.  We 

8

think that this particular condition, the Spisak error, 

9

was a meaningful condition and it necessitated a 

10
11

crossappeal for two reasons. 
 First, if Petitioner had crossappealed and 

12

prevailed on the Spisak claim, the State would have been 

13

obligated to fix that error, to cure that error upon 

14

pain of immediate release of the prisoner.  And that is 

15

a dramatically form  dramatically expanded form of 

16

relief that would necessitate a crossappeal. 

17
18
19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

How would you do 

that?  How would you cure the Spisak error? 
 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, there are many ways that 

20

the State and the defense and  I'm sorry, I should say 

21

the prosecution and the defense and the State court 

22

could cure the Spisak error.  It starts with the 

23

enunciation of the standard from the Federal district 

24

court as to exactly what the Sixth Amendment requires of 

25

a closing argument, which then guides both the 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, the Spisak 

2

error is something that the lawyer said in closing 

3

argument. 

4

 You're going to have a new trial, right? 

5

Well, presumably, I mean, the lawyer may say the same 

6

thing or the new lawyer may say the exact same thing or 

7

he may not.  It seems to me that it's a fairly academic 

8

dispute as to whether or not you have a separate claim 

9

once you have the relief of a new trial. 

10

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, we don't think it's an 

11

academic claim with respect to adding the condition that 

12

requires a certain level of constitutional performance 

13

for the defense counsel 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

There's always 

15

you always have the same level of constitutional 

16

performance.  This is only going to come up as a 

17

particular problem if for some reason the lawyer says 

18

exactly the same thing in closing as the prior lawyer 

19

did.  And I don't anticipate that happening. 

20

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, this actually happens in 

21

ineffective assistance of counsel claims in other 

22

contexts where the State court has the power, for 

23

example, to conduct a colloquy with the defense lawyer 

24

to probe what the judgment is that has informed the 

25

defense lawyer's representation, what the defense lawyer

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has done, what the defense lawyer plans to do.  And, of 

2

course, the State has the ability to object and move for 

3

curative instructions if the error recurs. 

4

 But the fundamental  the really important 

5

point is that if the error recurs or if the State fails 

6

to fix it, the remedy is immediate release, which we 

7

should all agree is a dramatically expanded form of 

8

of relief, which would necessitate a crossappeal. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Oldham, some of my 

10

questions to  to your opposing counsel suggest that 

11

ineffective assistance of counsel is mistake by mistake. 

12

That there are here three claims of ineffective 

13

assistance, not just one.  Maybe that's so. 

14

 What do you do with this case where the 

15

the trial court finds two instances of ineffective 

16

assistance, the State agrees that those two are valid. 

17

But appeals on the ground that it was harmless error, 

18

that the cumulative effect of those two mistakes was not 

19

enough to change the outcome of the trial. 

20

 The defendant, on the other hand, wants to 

21

raise the issue that there was, indeed, a third instance 

22

of ineffective assistance, and then if you combined all 

23

three, there would have been sufficient harm to enable 

24

setting aside the verdict. 

25

 What do you do with that case? 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

There 

Official

1

there the three separate instances have sort of been 

2

combined into one where  where the issue is the 

3

harmful effect. 

4

 MR. OLDHAM: 

The answer, Justice Scalia, 

5

would turn on the particularities of the third error of 

6

the hypothetical.  That is, if the third error was 

7

sufficient to push it across the line of the Sixth 

8

Amendment in the deficient performance standard, then 

9

that would be the contours of the ineffective assistance 

10
11
12

of counsel claim. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  So you would allow 

that one to be  to be raised without a crossappeal. 

13

 MR. OLDHAM: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But it would 
So long as it  it 

15

would  or at least so long as it's argued that that 

16

would produce the incremental effect of reversing the 

17

judgment. 

18

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Yes.  We agree with the 

19

Clarence Darrow hypothetical from the top half of the 

20

argument, which is that you measure the constitutional 

21

error based on where the lawyer's performance 

22

transgresses the balance of the Sixth Amendment.  And so 

23

if in the hypothetical, if that happened to have 

24

been on the third error, then that would be the contours 

25

of the ineffectiveness claim.

33

 To return to the Chief Justice's 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Before you leave that, I 

3

thought that your opposing counsel said that did happen 

4

here.  It was  you did raise a question of  of 

5

whether there was enough prejudice and, therefore, they 

6

were entitled to bring in the third as showing that even 

7

if the first two weren't sufficient, the third made up 

8

for it. 

9

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Justice Breyer, we disagree 

10

with that characterization of what happened in the court 

11

below.  What happened in the court below and in the 

12

District Court was that petitioner raised three 

13

allegations of deficiency.  This is how he characterized 

14

it in his own certiorari petition to this Court.  Three 

15

allegations of deficiency, each of which standing alone 

16

both transgressed the bounds of the Sixth Amendment and 

17

was a prejudicial error. 

18

 We fought back on two because the District 

19

Court had granted two, and those were reversed in the 

20

Fifth Circuit.  He raised a third independent error and 

21

if he wants to add that third independent error to the 

22

conditional release order, that is he wants the State to 

23

be held responsible and a constitutional error imputed 

24

to the State sufficient to command his immediate release 

25

upon failing to fix it at the second trial

The first two were thrown 

out on the grounds that there was no error; right?

 MR. OLDHAM:

Not on the ground that the 

5

effect was not harmful enough to warrant setting aside

That's correct.  They were

under  that's correct.  And although the State did

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, what do you do 

11

with the COA?  I mean, however we rule, we may be 

12

creating headaches.  Okay. 

13

 So petitioner wins on two and he loses on 

14

the third issue, the  the closing summation. 

15

 Does he have to then go for the COA? 

16

can't wait for you to appeal and then make that 

17

decision, can he? 

18

 MR. OLDHAM: 

He 

Well, under our view and under 

19

the hypothetical given on the top side of the argument 

20

he could crossappeal and that actually  and of course 

21

would have to get a COA.  But this is actually 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Crossappeal when there's 

no appeal?

He could have  he could have

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

He could not have taken 

an appeal.  Only the State could take an appeal; right? 
 MR. OLDHAM: 

Our view is that on this 

4

particular judgment he could have taken the first 

5

appeal.  And that's incredibly important because it 

6

would give him an additional protection if there was a 

7

second trial.  In particular, if he could get a Federal 

8

court to say the Sixth Amendment demands this level of 

9

competence 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Where does the statute or 

11

the rule talk about somebody who loses on a particular 

12

claim but wins the judgment, I thought  I'm looking at 

13

the order.  The order is on page 33 of the appendix and 

14

it doesn't say anything about Spisak or about  what 

15

was the other one  Wiggins.  It just says the order is 

16

three choices, release him from custody or give him a 

17

new sentencing hearing or sentence him to a term in 

18

prison.  That's it.  That's the order that we're 

19

reviewing 

20

 MR. OLDHAM: 

That's correct, 

21

Justice Ginsburg, but it must be read in the context of 

22

the entire opinion.  As we pointed out in footnote 6 of 

23

the red brief, this Court and other Federal courts often 

24

write their conditional release orders differently.  To 

25

say, for example, as Judge Pollack did in the Lamb case, 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these particular errors have to be fixed.  And everyone

2

seems to agree that if the judgment said these 

3

particular errors have to be fixed, he could have taken 

4

the first appeal or he could take a crossappeal. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If he could take his first 

6

appeal, how does it work?  That is, it seems to me that 

7

I've seen lots of petitions in habeas where an 

8

incarcerated person will bring up 40 arguments.  Now, 

9

suppose that he loses on 39 and he wins on one and he 

10

gets his new trial, and the court  the prosecution 

11

says fine, we'll go ahead, we'll give you the new trial. 

12

Is the lawyer then supposed to appeal his 39 losses? 

13

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, as a practical matter, 

14

the notice of appeal deadline would be far in advance of 

15

the retrial decision. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no.  You said he could 

17

take the first appeal.  So before the new trial goes on 

18

he says, I think I'll take the first appeal on the other 

19

39 that I lost on.  Can he do that? 

20

 MR. OLDHAM: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Absolutely.  And for 
Well, then a lot of people, 

22

you know, I'm not saying they're badly motivated, 

23

they're in prison, they might think this sort of 

24

interesting, I might lose at trial, let's just see if I 

25

can't find a few other grounds here.

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, it's obviously not a lot

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I've never heard of that. 

Have you found examples where that's happened? 
 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, as the petitioner points 

6

out, there's only 18 of these cases in the Court of 

7

Appeals from last year, but a great example 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Wait.  Have you found many, 

one, cases where a petitioner won in the District Court, 

10

there is no State appeal, but he did lose on other 

11

grounds and he decided to take a first appeal on several 

12

of those other grounds? 

13
14
15

 MR. OLDHAM: 

I'm unaware of any but I 

only because the State often appeals 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, the reason 

16

there might not be any, I mean, any decision by the 

17

Federal court in that situation would be, I think, a 

18

purely advisory opinion.  Let's say he loses on a 

19

confrontation clause claim, he wins on inadequate 

20

assistance of counsel.  He takes the appeal.  If I'm the 

21

judge on appeal I say, well, in the new trial, they may 

22

not call the witness that you said shouldn't have been 

23

called and you want me to issue an advisory opinion just 

24

in case they do.  I don't see how he can do that. 

25

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, it wouldn't be an 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

advisory opinion in this sense.  It would say that what

2

happened in the previous trial transgressed the 

3

confrontation clause or the Sixth Amendment, depending 

4

on which case  which claimant lost below and it would 

5

give him a very valuable procedural protection at the 

6

second trial. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  It's superfluous in 

8

the sense that it is unnecessary to the judgment.  He 

9

got the judgment, he won it.  The trial was set aside. 

10

The conviction was set aside, he got a new trial.  And 

11

he's saying, oh, there are additional reasons why I 

12

should have gotten a new trial.  I'm not going to listen 

13

to that.  That's absurd.  You got what you wanted.  Now 

14

go away. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 MR. OLDHAM: 

That  Justice Scalia, our 

17

view of the conditional release order is significantly 

18

weightier than that.  What we think a conditional 

19

release order is and what we think that this Court's 

20

habeas cases demand is that a conditional release order 

21

is a Federal court's order on a constitutional claim 

22

that says the State must release, that is the actual 

23

quintessential habeas remedy, or fix these errors. 

24

Never does the conditional release order say, you get a 

25

new trial. 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But let's  you may

2

be  this one did, said release  give him a new 

3

hearing or release him. 

4

 But--I'm taking I do want you to answer 

5

my COA question, okay, because what you're saying is 

6

exactly what Justice Scalia is worried about, which is, 

7

is he going to go present the COA and are we going to 

8

even entertain it since he won his release?  But if he 

9

 does he have to get a COA? 

10

 But more importantly, what happens when 

11

there's a new hearing?  Those two mistakes are not 

12

repeated but a new one is introduced and the old one is 

13

repeated. 

14

 Are you saying he can't appeal again? 

15

 MR. OLDHAM: 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17
18

No. 
On the old one or the 

new one? 
 MR. OLDHAM: 

Our rule is actually much more 

19

 much more protective of the prisoner than that. 

20

Because if the old error is recommitted he gets 

21

immediate release.  And that's the 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, that's  you're 

23

saying he only gets immediate release if it's the old 

24

error that the judge found on the first habeas. 

25

 MR. OLDHAM: 

That's right. 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But let's assume that

2

the second error is  the third error is committed and 

3

even a new one is committed that wasn't a part of the 

4

first function, can he appeal? 

5

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Of course.  Of course.  And he 

6

has  yes, he has a new judgment.  He can challenge the 

7

new judgment.  The only question is how much relief 

8

affords to him.  Because he agrees with us, to go back 

9

to Justice Scalia's example, he agrees with us that he 

10
11

could 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can we go back to basics. 

12

Isn't it true that a judgment winner does not have to 

13

appeal an issue on which he lost but he is  if he's 

14

content with the judgment, he can present arguments that 

15

would entitle him to relief.  He can assert defensively. 

16

A judgment winner doesn't have to appeal, doesn't have 

17

to crossappeal.  That is the general rule; right? 

18

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Yes, we agree.  The only 

19

question is whether he's a judgment winner and we 

20

pointed out many examples where people can be prevailing 

21

parties in the sense that the judgment imposes no 

22

liability on them but they can nonetheless appeal and we 

23

would submit that this is one of them, and it's 

24

precisely because he wants the additional protection. 

25

 To go back to Justice Scalia's example, 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

everyone agrees that if the petitioner wins on one claim

2

 but he wants to raise a coerced confession claim he can 

3

 file a first appeal or a crossappeal. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Oldham, suppose it were he 

5

 just had two Wiggins claims.  One was the lawyer 

6

 didn't find the psychological report and the other was 

7

 the lawyer failed to put on my mother as a character 

8

 witness.  He loses one, he wins the other.  Does he have 

9

 to take a crossappeal on that? 

10

 MR. OLDHAM: 

He has to take a crossappeal 

11

 if he wants the one he lost on added to the conditional 

12

 release order.  That is, he wants the protection that 

13

 the Federal court would provide against that error being 

14

 either recommitted or failing  the State failing to 

15

 fix it. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But they  you keep 

17

 talking about the conditional release order.  It doesn't 

18

 say anything about what the State must do, what errors 

19

 it must correct, it's on page 35, it just says give him 

20

 a new sentencing hearing or sentence him to a term of 

21

 imprisonment.  It doesn't say, because of this, because 

22

 of that, because of this. 

23

 MR. OLDHAM: 

And that's absolutely correct. 

24

 But we  it seems like both sides agree that it could 

25

 have said exactly what the opinion says.  That is, I 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 found two errors here, I have not found an error on the

2

 third ground and therefore, it could have been 

3

 incorporated in the text, as they often do. 

4

 As I say, footnote 6 of the red brief 

5

 collects a series of the ways that Federal courts phrase 

6

 them, and it would be a bizarre crossappeal that would 

7

 turn on the particular phraseology of the conditional 

8

 release order when everyone agrees that the meaning of 

9

 it is the same. 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Let  let me just ask you 

11

 this question about COAs.  Let's just take a case 

12

 there's no crossappeal or anything.  The prisoner 

13

 alleges in  inadequate assistance of counsel, and he 

14

 loses.  He files a COA.  He says, my counsel was 

15

 inadequate because there were two Wiggins errors, he did 

16

 not  two Wiggins errors.  That is what he says in the 

17

 COA. 

18
19
20

 The COA is granted. 

Now he files his brief. 

 Can he allege a Spisak error as well? 
 MR. OLDHAM: 

As far as I know, no court in 

21

 the United States  no circuit court in the United 

22

 States would allow him to do that because of 2253(c)(3). 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So  so can he  so in 

24

 other words, in a COA, you have to list every error that 

25

 counsel made and at  at  on  on pain of not being 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 able to argue that in your brief?
 MR. OLDHAM: 

Yes, Your Honor.  That is what 

3

 2253(c)(3) says, issuebyissue specification.  And 

4

 every court of appeals in the United States agrees, even 

5

 the Seventh Circuit, that would seem to  would say all 

6

 three of the errors that you hypothesize would be the 

7

 same.  Even in the Seventh Circuit, you would have to 

8

 get a certificate of appealability in that circumstance. 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But that's  (c)(3) 

10

 comes after (c)(1).  And (c)(1) says you need a COA to 

11

 appeal from the final order.  And so if you don't need a 

12

 COA to appeal from the final order, you go on and appeal 

13

 from the final order.  The final order is fine.  You 

14

 would never get to (c)(3). 

15

 (C)(3) says if you need a COA, then you will 

16

 indicate which specific issues.  But it doesn't 

17

 (c)(3) doesn't tell you when you need a COA.  (C)(1)(A) 

18

 tells you that. 

19

 MR. OLDHAM: 

That's correct, Justice 

20

 Ginsburg.  And (c)(1), as it's currently written, 

21

 predated even AEDPA.  And even before AEDPA, that is in 

22

 1986, the Second Circuit interpreted (c)(1) as it is 

23

 currently written to require prisoners, when they are 

24

 the appellees, to nonetheless get COAs. 

25

 And as we sit here today, 6 out the 8 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Where does that  where

2

 does that come from in the statute?  I mean, the statute 

3

 says you need the COA to appeal from the final order in 

4

 a habeas proceeding.  Well  in the final order.  I 

5

 don't want an appeal from the final order.  It's good. 

6

 MR. OLDHAM: 

So the preAEDPA standard was 

7

 the certificate of probable cause standard, which courts 

8

 of appeal, starting with the Roman decision in 1986, 

9

 required prisoners to satisfy the issue  the  the 

10

 CPC requirement even as the appellee.  And as we sit 

11

 here today, 6 out of the 8 courts of appeals would 

12

 require the Petitioner in this case to get a certificate 

13

 of appealability. 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Suppose the 

 isn't it 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

In fact, you get it from 

17

 the language of the statute, which says you need a 

18

 certificate to appeal from the final order. 

19

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, as this 

20

 Court has said twice in both the MillerEl and in Slack, 

21

 the language of this statute, 2253(c), imposes a list of 

22

 necessary but not sufficient conditions.  And it is 

23

 entirely within the provenance of the courts of appeals, 

24

 to deal with these issues on a regular basis, to 

25

 interpret that language to also apply to a prisoner who 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 is the appellee, who wants to raise an issue for the

2

 court of appeal's consideration, both because that's the 

3

 purpose of the statute and because it was the preAEDPA 

4

 standard upon which the statute was enacted. 

5

 And so if I might just return to the Chief 

6

 Justice's hypothetical about the potential for something 

7

 not happening again.  This is  it's much more 

8

 significant than simply that.  If you think about the 

9

 quintessential error that could never recur, it would 

10

 be, for example, a Brady violation, that is, the 

11

 withholding of exculpatory evidence.  Once it's in the 

12

 possession of the defendant, how could it ever recur? 

13

 But it's in precisely that circumstance that 

14

 one of the most powerful exhibitions of a conditional 

15

 release order has worked out because in the  in the 

16

 Wolf v. Clark case, the Fourth Circuit, the Commonwealth 

17

 of Virginia received a Brady remedy, that is, it  it 

18

 had its conviction vacated because the  the particular 

19

 evidence had not been turned over to the defense. 

20

 Now, that error, that particular error could 

21

 never be recommitted, but the Commonwealth violated the 

22

 spirit and the intention of that conditional release 

23

 order by interviewing the jailhouse informant that gave 

24

 the evidence, threatening him with perjury, and 

25

 convincing him not to testify at the second trial. 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And in that circumstance, because the

2

 conditional release order  which was phrased 

3

 materially identically to ours, by the way  the 

4

 phraseology did not mention Brady, but because he had 

5

 the power of a Federal conditional release order, 

6

 instead of having to sit through another trial, instead 

7

 of having to have the Brady evidence excluded, he was 

8

 able to go back to the Federal district court that 

9

 issued the original conditional order and 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Oh, sure.  I mean, 

11

 there may be situations in which the State or the 

12

 ineffective counsel, they do repeat the error, or they 

13

 may not. 

14

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, this one couldn't have 

15

 been repeated.  It was, by definition, not repeatable. 

16

 But it was because the State failed to fix it.  See, 

17

 it's actually a significantly greater obligation on the 

18

 State than not  than simply not doing the same thing 

19

 over again.  Right? 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Thinking here to the  the 

21

 Criminal Justice Foundation filed a brief, and  and as 

22

 I read it, I thought, well, the point  the point of 

23

 this is don't make it too complicated.  So they say, 

24

 well, let's just consider what Estelle says, you 

25

 Can't be deprived of you have to make a substantial

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 showing of the denial of a Federal right.
 So they're saying the Federal right here 

3

 that we're deprived of is a Sixth Amendment right to 

4

 to counsel, period. 

5

 There are a lot of different bases for it. 

6

 There are a lot of different things that happen, but 

7

 that's the single ground or right or, in this case, 

8

 issue doesn't change the word of  that it used to 

9

 mean.  So call it this one thing.  It's so simple, and 

10
11

 at that point, let the court of appeals deal with it. 
 As soon as we try to separate different 

12

 bases for saying that this was a deprivation of the 

13

 right to counsel, we are going to produce a pretty good 

14

 nightmare because they shade into each other often. 

15

 They're related in a variety of ways.  They may be or 

16

 may not be related through the prejudice problem.  And 

17

 lawyers will start wondering when they have to file a 

18

 court crossappeal, and we will create a  a mess. 

19

 So that's the basic argument, I think, of 

20

 this brief, and it is one of the arguments that they're 

21

 trying to make. 

22
23
24
25

 Now, what is your simple, clear answer to 
 that? 
 MR. OLDHAM: 

The current rule in 6 out of 

 the 8 Courts of Appeals is not a nightmare.  And the 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 current rule reads issue in 2253(c)(3) to mean issue,

2

 not to mean a single claim.  And so the nightmare that's 

3

 predicted or the  the pragmatic solution isn't in want 

4

 of a problem in the sense that this is the  the rule 

5

 that we have advanced on the certificate of 

6

 appealability is the majority rule.  And as far as 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But isn't that a rule 

8

 that was set up, as Justice Ginsburg said, only when the 

9

 petitioner hasn't won.  But here, there's a judgment for 

10

 resentencing.  As the Chief Justice indicates, the error 

11

 may or may not  the third error may or may not be 

12

 repeated.  So go back to that point, which is if you're 

13

 a successful litigant, do you even have a right to try 

14

 to go get a COA? 

15

 MR. OLDHAM: 

So the rule that I'm providing, 

16

 the 6 out of 8, is in the circumstance where the 

17

 prisoner won and wants to, nonetheless, raise additional 

18

 issues.  So it's exactly this case. 

19

 And the simple fact of recurrence is both 

20

 a  a difficult rule to predict exante as the Wolf 

21

 case would illustrate, but it's also  would give short 

22

 shrift to ineffective assistance of counsel claims 

23

 because 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why doesn't this fit 

 why doesn't this case just fit what is the standard rule 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that a party who's content with the judgment doesn't

2

 have to crossappeal to preserve arguments that enabled 

3

 him to retain the benefits of the judgment?  That's the 

4

 standard rule. 

5

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Justice Ginsburg, it fits 

6

 within that rule.  It just begs the question of what the 

7

 judgment is.  And in our  in our view, the judgment 

8

 entitles him to  to  to either release or to a 

9

 resentencing under particular terms.  And if he wants to 

10

 change the terms of the resentencing, he's attacking the 

11

 judgment and expanding his relief. 

12

 We all agree that he would be attacking the 

13

 judgment and expanding his relief if he wanted to add 

14

 coerced confession.  Our view is that ineffective 

15

 assistance of counsel is not a second class right.  It 

16

 is not one that can be subordinated to a coerced 

17

 confession claim, and that for the exact same reasons 

18

 that the coerced confession claim may come up, may not 

19

 come up, may be difficult to understand exante, the 

20

 practical significance of it may be difficult to discern 

21

 exante, he still has to crossappeal in both 

22

 circumstances.  Yes, he conceded in the top 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But if I understand the 

24

 implications  this goes back to, I guess, the 

25

 hypothetical I asked before.  Now I have 5 Wiggins 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 claims.  You didn't put on my mother, and you didn't put

2

 on my brother, and you didn't put on my sister, you 

3

 didn't put on my uncle, you didn't put on my aunt, and 

4

 the court says, you know, we think your brother and your 

5

 mother really did have something to say, we're not so 

6

 sure about the others. 

7

 Do you think I have to crossappeal on my 

8

 aunt and my sister and my uncle, and not only did you 

9

 think I have to crossappeal, but you think that if I 

10

 had won and the State had not taken an appeal, I would 

11

 have had to appeal myself? 

12

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, two things, Justice 

13

 Kagan.  One is that on  on that particular 

14

 hypothetical, I would suggest that there's just one 

15

 Wiggins claim, and that is failure to call family to 

16

 testify.  And so there is sort of a tension in how we 

17

 conceive of the claim in this case and it's 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

19

 another hypothetical 

20

 MR. OLDHAM:

 failure to call the psychiatrist, failure to find the

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Sure. 
 failure to go investigate

 my mental background.
 MR. OLDHAM: 

Absolutely.  And our position 

3

 is, yes, it's not that you have to crossappeal, it's 

4

 that you can crossappeal, right, in the sense that you 

5

 could, if you wanted to go back and have a second trial 

6

 without having the ones that you lost protected by the 

7

 Federal Constitution, then you can.  But if you want to 

8

 have a conditional release order that commands the State 

9

 to fix those particular errors upon pain of immediately 

10

 releasing you, our rule allows you to crossappeal, 

11

 whereas their rule does not. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13
14

16

So do you need a COA, 

 too? 
 MR. OLDHAM: 

Yes.  Yes, Your Honor.  You 

 would always need a certificate of appealability. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How do you do that? 

17

 If  take Justice Kagan's example.  You've won, and you 

18

 want to  you're  you're willing to forego unless 

19

 there's an appeal by you.  Now I'm going to 

20

 crossappeal.  Now I need a COA, too, before I know what 

21

 you're doing? 

22

 MR. OLDHAM: 

Well, the prisoner  it's 

23

 common ground that if the prisoner appeals on the top or 

24

 the bottom the prisoner needs a certificate of 

25

 appealability.  And our position is that the particular 

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 rules that we're offering here offer protection to

2

 prisoners in the sense that  and it offers protections 

3

 to the State as well, right?  It lets everyone know before 

4

 we have to go back and have another trial about the mother 

5

 or the sister or the cousin or the psychiatric report 

6

 what the rules of the Sixth Amendment game are.  It 

7

 allows the prisoner to know that if the State doesn't 

8

 fix that error he gets to go free and it allows the 

9

 State to make a decision as to perhaps not even 

10

 conducting a trial again. 

11

 We've offered this example in the briefs, 

12

 it's been  and it's unrebutted in the reply that 

13

 depending on what the particular conditions are, the 

14

 State may forego and commute to a term of years, which 

15

 is the ultimate benefit to the prisoner.  And so it's 

16

 incredibly important to give a prisoner the right to 

17

 crossappeal in that circumstance.  And if he wants 

18

 the court of appeals to address that issue he has to 

19

 crossappeal because it would be expanding that relief 

20

 by adding a condition on a conditional release order 

21

 that the State must obey or fix or otherwise let him go 

22

 immediately. 

23

 If there are no further questions.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH L. SCHAFFER, JR.
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. SCHAFFER: 

I'm a  as the Court can 

4

 probably tell, I'm a fairly simpleminded person, and 

5

 when I looked at this and said is there anything I need 

6

 to do to get this closing argument in front of the 

7

 circuit in response to the State's appeal, I said: 

8

 Well, no; I won on ineffective assistance of counsel. 

9

 I'm just making another argument in support of the 

10

 judgment as to why there was prejudice, end of story. 

11

 That's the extent of my thought. 

12

 The bulk of these Federal habeas cases, as 

13

 I'm sure the Court knows, 90 percent or more are pro se 

14

 State court prisoners trying to navigate the treacherous 

15

 AEDPA waters without any help at all.  And it's tough 

16

 enough to win on the merits.  To create the procedural 

17

 nightmare of even getting into the ballpark that the 

18

 State would have you create is like throwing out the 

19

 baby with the bath water.  The simple thing is we want 

20

 to make it easy for the courts to acquire jurisdiction. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The only way you can win 

22

 this, according to you, is if we rule IAC claims are one 

23

 claim? 

24
25

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

No.  I can also win, Justice 

 Sotomayor, on the basis that, even if IAC is multiple 

54

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 claims, I did not seek to enlarge my rights under the

2

 judgment.  And it goes back to the State's position 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So when is it that you 

 have to crossappeal? 
 MR. SCHAFFER: 

If I want to enlarge my 

6

 rights.  For example, if I win on punishment phase IAC 

7

 and I lose on guilt phase whatever and I want more than 

8

 a new punishment hearing, I would have to crossappeal 

9

 obviously in that situation. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you answered no, but 

11

 then your explanation produces yes.  You're saying you 

12

 don't have to crossappeal because you won on an 

13

 ineffective assistance of counsel claim; right?  There 

14

 is one, you know, omnibus ineffective assistance of 

15

 counsel claim.  You won on that; right? 

16

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Correct. 
So your answer to Justice 

18

 Sotomayor should have been the opposite of what it was. 

19

 If you said yes, you should have said no. If you said no, 

20

 you should of said yes. 

21

 MR. SCHAFFER: 

I do that all the time.  But 

22

 my understanding was she was asking me when would you 

23

 need to crossappeal, and I was saying the scenario in 

24

 which you would.  This is not one of them. 

25

 Thank you.
