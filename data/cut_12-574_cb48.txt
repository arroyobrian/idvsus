 (10:03 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument first this morning in Case 12574, 

5

Walden v. Fiore. 

6

11

 Mr. Bucholtz. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. BUCHOLTZ 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 In holding that the  in holding that 

12

Respondents could bring this Bivens lawsuit against 

13

Officer Anthony Walden in Nevada, the Ninth Circuit made 

14

two errors that independently require a reversal. 

15

 First, as to personal jurisdiction, the 

16

Ninth Circuit held that it was sufficient that 

17

Respondents have connections to Nevada, and that Officer 

18

Walden allegedly targeted his conduct at them, knowing 

19

of their contacts with Nevada.  That plaintiffcentered 

20

approach is inconsistent with this Court's precedence 

21

which emphasize that the defendant himself must have 

22

meaningful contacts with the forum State. 

23

 Second, as to venue, the Ninth Circuit 

24

relied on the fact that the Respondents felt in Nevada 

25

the effects of Officer Walden's alleged conduct in

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Georgia.  That, similarly, Plaintiffcentered approach 

2

is in conflict with the text of the venue statute, 

3

1391(b)(2), which focuses on where the events or 

4

omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, not where 

5

the impact of those events or omissions may be felt. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you have any preference 

7

as to which of those errors you would like us to rely 

8

on? 

9

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, Justice Scalia, I 

10

think, for the reasons set out in the Federal Law 

11

Enforcement Officers' amicus brief, which I will try to 

12

explain, I think that it would be preferable for the 

13

Court to address personal jurisdiction and not just 

14

venue, that the reason is that venue in removed cases 

15

works differently.  There really is no venue, per se, in 

16

removed cases. 

17

 And so if the Court only reaches venue here, 

18

holds that venue is improper, in theory  and maybe 

19

there are limitations problems with this, but in theory, 

20

the plaintiffs could refile the same lawsuit in State 

21

court in Nevada.  It would be a Bivens lawsuit; it would 

22

arise under Federal law, so we would remove it. 

23

 But then removal would mean, under 1441(a), 

24

venue would be proper, per se, in the district of 

25

removal because that's the way removal works, and this

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Court so held in Polizzi half a century ago. 
 And then there would be no personal 

3

jurisdiction, and then the personal jurisdiction would 

4

be under the Ninth Circuit's decision, and we'd be back 

5

exactly where we are now. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course, the venue 

7

question does not  does not bring into the Court a 

8

constitutional question and the jurisdictional  the 

9

jurisdictional one does. 

10

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

constitutional questions. 

13

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

That's true. 
And we usually try to avoid 

That's true.  And the 

14

avoidance canon is certainly one factor the Court could 

15

take into account in deciding which issue to reach  or 

16

which issues to reach or in what order. 

17

 On the other hand, the personal jurisdiction 

18

question is  is a constitutional question, but it's 

19

not a constitutional question in the strong sense of the 

20

term because the only reason that the  the personal 

21

jurisdiction question, as applied in this case, is a 

22

constitutional one is because Congress hasn't provided 

23

for nationwide service of process for Bivens claims. 

24
25

 And as the Court pointed out in Omni 
Capital, the Congress has the power to do that.  It's

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not for the Court to do that on its own, to fill a 

2

perceived policy gap in personal jurisdiction law. 

3

 And so, even though it is a constitutional 

4

question as currently configured, if Congress thought 

5

that it were a problem to apply the existing personal 

6

jurisdiction jurisprudence to Bivens claims and wanted 

7

to provide for nationwide service of process based on 

8

the idea that what counts is contacts with the U.S. as a 

9

whole, as opposed to any particular State. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It's not likely, is it, 

11

considering that the Bivens claim was created by this 

12

Court and not Congress. 

13

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

I'm not suggesting that 

14

Congress should do that.  I think Congress should not do 

15

that.  I think Bivens claims, for the reason that Your 

16

Honor just stated, is  is sort of the last place 

17

that  that anyone should start to create a more 

18

plaintifffriendly version of personal jurisdiction. 

19

The Court has gone  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You  you would not have 

21

any problem about  assuming we agree with you that 

22

it's  there's no personal jurisdiction, it's the wrong 

23

venue, for the district court in Nevada to transfer the 

24

case to the Federal district court in Georgia? 

25

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, I think,

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Ginsburg, in the ordinary course, in a  in a 

2

case starting in district court, under Section 1631 

3

or  or the venue statute, that would be an appropriate 

4

course. 

5

 Here, the district court asked Respondents 

6

specifically, if I agree with Officer Walden on personal 

7

jurisdiction or venue, do you want me to transfer, or do 

8

you want me to dismiss?  Because the statute gives the 

9

district court discretion and  and says, in the 

10

interest of justice, transfer is  is permissible in 

11

lieu of dismissal. 

12

 The Respondents said, emphatically, we don't 

13

want you to transfer.  We want you to dismiss.  I guess 

14

they  they decided they would rather have an appeal to 

15

the Ninth Circuit and take their  their chances 

16

with  with an appeal, then pursue the case in Georgia. 

17

So I think under the unusual 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's probably 

19

it turned out to be a good  good strategy, at least to 

20

the extent they got to the Ninth Circuit. 

21

 Isn't Calder against Jones in considerable 

22

tension with your proposition that you don't look to the 

23

plaintiff's contacts with the forum? 

24
25

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

I don't think so, Your Honor. 

I think there  there is definitely some language in

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Calder that could be read in a variety of ways.  I think 

2

the key language in Calder  excuse me  as the Court 

3

states its conclusions, it says, "In sum, California was 

4

the focal point both of the article and of the harm 

5

suffered by the plaintiffs." 

6

 And then the Court later says that  that 

7

the defendants expressly aimed their conduct at 

8

California.  It doesn't say at the plaintiff, who 

9

happened to be in California; it says at California. 

10

And I think that's not an accident, that the Court used 

11

those formulations. 

12

 In all of the personal jurisdiction cases 

13

before Calder and since  and, for that matter, decided 

14

the same day, in Keeton  decided the same day as 

15

Calder, the Court has emphasized that random, 

16

attenuated, and fortuitous contacts with the forum State 

17

are insufficient and that, in particular, contacts 

18

between the defendant and the  and the forum that are 

19

created by the unilateral activity of the plaintiff are 

20

not sufficient.  So 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What do you think the Court 

22

meant when it said that the  the article was aimed at 

23

California? 

24
25

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

I think what the Court meant, 

Justice Alito, is that the article was distributed in

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

California, and California was, by far, the largest 

2

market for the National Enquirer.  The article recounted 

3

events or  or alleged events, that happened in 

4

California.  And the article was drawn from California 

5

sources. 

6

 So it's not fortuitous that the effect of 

7

the article was felt in California.  That was  that 

8

was  nothing about that was fortuitous because the 

9

the defendants knew that the article would be 

10

distributed widely in California, that it was the 

11

largest market, and they 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

When it was distributed, it 

13

was distributed everywhere.  It was the National 

14

Enquirer, so it was probably in every supermarket in the 

15

country. 

16

 And why does California, as an abstract 

17

entity, care about an article that makes allegedly 

18

defamatory statements about things that people 

19

supposedly did in California?  I don't quite understand 

20

that. 

21

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, let me try to answer 

22

the first part of your question first, Justice Alito. 

23

It's true that the National Enquirer was national; it 

24

was distributed throughout the country.  But the Court 

25

went  went to pains in the opinion to emphasize that

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

California was the largest market. 
 And so when the Court said the brunt of the 

3

harm  that  this is right after the Court's 

4

reference to express aiming, where the Court says 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

everything, isn't it? 

7

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

It's the largest market for 

Well, I think particularly for the 

8

National Enquirer, when you're talking about articles 

9

about celebrities, about actresses in particular, that 

10

allegedly injure their professional reputation and 

11

prevent them from getting future acting jobs. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I don't understand. 

13

Are you suggesting if this  everything was the same, 

14

except Ms. Jones was in New York, there'd be a different 

15

result in that case? 

16
17
18

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

No, I'm not suggesting that. 

I think that 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I thought, 

19

several times, you said California was the biggest 

20

market. 

21

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Right.  I think  I think 

22

the way that  that Calder reads, I think that there 

23

are a number of factors.  One of them is plaintiff's 

24

residence in California.  That's where she was when she 

25

suffered the emotional distress from  from reading

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the article about herself and where her job prospects 

2

were  were allegedly adversely affected. 

3

 But it's also true the Court points out that 

4

not only is  when the Court says the defendants 

5

expressly aimed their conduct at California, the next 

6

passage after that, where the Court explains what 

7

that  what express aiming at California means, it says 

8

California was not only where  where Ms. Jones 

9

suffered the brunt of the harm, but where the defendants 

10

knew that the Enquirer had its largest circulation. 

11

 So I don't think you can disentangle the 

12

fact that that's where she was, which, of course, was a 

13

relevant factor in that case because it was true, from 

14

the fact that the defendants, in a broader sense, in a 

15

more  in a sense not based on her unilateral activity, 

16

but in a sense based on their own contacts, aimed at 

17

California. 

18

 They drew their 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, what does it mean 

20

what does it mean, in the context of an intentional 

21

tort, which is what we're talking about here, to aim at 

22

a particular State, if it doesn't mean to aim at a 

23

person who you know to be within that State? 

24
25

 I mean, nobody conducts an intentional tort 
intending to injure California, per se.  You're

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

intending to injure a person who resides in California. 

2

So what would it actually mean to aim conduct at a 

3

State, irrespective of a person? 

4

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, Justice Kagan, I think 

5

the answer is that it could take a few forms.  It 

6

depends on the type of case.  It would be very difficult 

7

to try to come up with the single  you know, sort of 

8

comprehensive unitary answer to that question that would 

9

govern all types of cases. 

10

 I think the way that the plurality put it in 

11

J. McIntyre, for intentional tort cases, is that maybe 

12

you're intending to obstruct the laws of the forum 

13

State.  That would be more meaningfully aimed at the 

14

forum State qua State and not just somebody who happens 

15

to be in it or have a connection to it. 

16

 Another way that conduct could be aimed at a 

17

State would be if  if it's a species of purposeful 

18

availment or purposeful direction, where you're 

19

projecting your conduct into that State, whether 

20

that's  whether that's physical and literal or whether 

21

it's  it's through some indirect or technological 

22

means for 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

24

and I'm sorry.  Please. 

25

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, suppose  suppose 

 for some benefit, for some

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reason, where you're projecting your conduct into that 

2

State, not just because that's where the plaintiff 

3

happens to be, which is incidental and irrelevant to you 

4

that the plaintiff is there, as opposed to anywhere 

5

else, but because you're seeking that State out. 

6

 That could be  it could be, in a case like 

7

J. McIntyre, the Court, of course, divided over whether 

8

in a  in a very broad sense, sending your product into 

9

the stream of commerce, intending that it in some 

10

sense  you know, go to the U.S. as a whole, without 

11

any particular focus on a given State, was sufficient. 

12

 But at least there  at least there, you 

13

have the intent to serve the U.S. market as a whole. 

14

And so you at least are on notice that your own conduct 

15

is putting you at risk of being haled into court in any 

16

one of the States. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  I mean, I guess I 

18

just  the  the McIntyre example is a very different 

19

kind of example because, in those cases, you really are 

20

talking about a company seeking to serve a general 

21

market in a State. 

22

 But intentional tort cases don't usually 

23

have that quality.  You're going after a particular 

24

person in an intentional tort case.  And it's odd to 

25

think of going after an intentional  a particular

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

person, whether it's a defamation suit or it's a fraud 

2

suit or  or what have you, as  as targeting the 

3

State itself. 

4

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, I think if it's a 

5

defamation suit, Justice Kagan, if you project your 

6

defamation into the forum State, then it's fair to say 

7

that you've, in a sense, entered the forum State, 

8

whether that's electronic or physical, as in Calder. 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But in  in this case, it 

10

was known  or should have been known that these were 

11

gamblers; they were in Nevada.  That's where a lot of 

12

that's where their gambling takes place.  They were 

13

residents of Nevada.  So in that sense, they were like 

14

the plaintiff in  in Calder.  The injury was there, 

15

and the defendant arguably knew or should have known 

16

that that's where its major impact would be. 

17

 I recognize your point that, when you take 

18

money away, then you're inconvenienced in any State 

19

where you happen to be, but there was an argument 

20

here  it seems to me there is an argument here that 

21

this was gambling, and these people were from Nevada, 

22

and so you've  this  this curtails their right or 

23

or their option to conduct  to conduct their 

24

activities in  in Nevada. 

25

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, the

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

complaint alleges that the plaintiffs had contacts with 

2

Nevada, were residents of Nevada.  Of course, they 

3

showed Officer Walden California licenses.  That's what 

4

the complaint alleges, not Nevada licenses.  And so at 

5

the time of their actual 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But didn't they say they 

7

were residents in both places, in both California and 

8

Nevada? 

9

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

They do say that.  But 

10

there's no reason to think  and even they don't allege 

11

this, that Officer Walden knew that at the time that he 

12

actually interacted with them.  And so there's no 

13

allegation that he 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Let me ask this  and 

15

it's probably clear in the briefs.  Is  is the 

16

gravamen of the complaint the seizure at the airport or 

17

the later false affidavit?  Because, to the extent it's 

18

the later false affidavit, that cuts against you 

19

marginally. 

20

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, I would emphasize 

21

"marginally," Justice Kennedy, because I think the 

22

gravamen of the complaint is both.  I don't think 

23

there's a way to separate them.  The effect that the 

24

plaintiffs are  the reason for their lawsuit 

25

they're claiming damages based on the allegedly false

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

affidavit, is that it took them longer than it otherwise 

2

would have to get their money back. 

3

 It's the same money that was seized in 

4

Atlanta.  So it's a continuation of the effect of the 

5

seizure.  You can't separate them cleanly.  And the 

6

affidavit 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, would you  would 

8

your answer be different  suppose that the  the 

9

officer had said, you can keep  you can keep your 

10
11

money, go on to Nevada with it. 
 And then, once Fiore  the Fiores had reached 

12

Nevada, the officer said  the officer filed a false 

13

affidavit, which, let's say, froze the Fiores' bank 

14

accounts.  Would your  would your answer be different? 

15

The affidavit was filed in Georgia, but the money was 

16

not seized in Georgia; instead, the money has gone on to 

17

Nevada.  Is there personal jurisdiction in Nevada? 

18

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, Justice Kagan, I think 

19

if  if what Officer Walden allegedly had done  of 

20

course, that's not this case  is freeze a bank account 

21

in Nevada, then 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, he did it by filing an 

affidavit in Georgia, and then it froze a bank account. 
 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

No, I understand that.  I 

understand the question.  But if what he had done is

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

freeze a bank account in Nevada, then maybe it would be 

2

fair to say that he had entered into Nevada by freezing 

3

the bank account in Nevada. 

4

 But, here, the cash was in Atlanta. 

The 

5

plaintiffs brought the cash to Atlanta.  Officer Walden 

6

didn't seek them out, knowing that they had any 

7

connection to Nevada.  They  he didn't go to Nevada. 

8

He didn't direct anyone in Nevada to do anything.  He 

9

didn't seize a  or freeze a bank account in Nevada or 

10

direct anyone to do anything like that. 

11

 He never had any contact with Nevada at all, 

12

except for the very intangible contact, if you can call 

13

it that, of  of allegedly writing this affidavit to 

14

keep the plaintiffs from getting the money back sooner 

15

than they would have. 

16

 But the plaintiffs would have gotten the 

17

money back wherever they happened to be or, really, more 

18

precisely, wherever their lawyer happened to be.  The 

19

fact that they chose a lawyer in Nevada, and that's 

20

where they asked the government to send them their money 

21

back, ultimately, is the very definition of fortuitous 

22

contact between Walden and Nevada. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you tell me  you 

24

started by saying that our personal jurisdiction and 

25

venue provisions and jurisprudence center on a  on a

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defendant's action, not on the plaintiff's action or 

2

injury.  Calder suggests otherwise. 

3

 But how do you respond, not only to 

4

Justice  I'll do this after, but let me just pose the 

5

question, and you can answer it on your rebuttal. 

6

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Thank you. 
I'm worried about the 

8

internet effects from somebody's account in Vermont by 

9

someone in Illinois  the hypothetical on page 19, who 

10
11

steals something from a store in California. 
 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Thank you, Justice Sotomayor.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA ARBUS SHERRY, 

19

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

20

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

21

 MS. SHERRY: 

22

please the Court: 

23

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 If I could start with this Court's decision 

24

in Calder because the facts of this case stand in stark 

25

contrast to Calder.  In Calder, the article was all

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about the State of California.  It was about the 

2

California activities of a California resident whose 

3

career was centered in California, based on California 

4

sources, and in a magazine that its  where its primary 

5

publication was in California. 

6

 Here, even if you were to focus just on the 

7

affidavit, the affidavit is, in every real sense, 

8

focused on the State of Georgia.  According to 

9

Respondents' own allegation, it recounts what happened 

10
11

in the Atlanta airport in Georgia. 
 It was based on information that was 

12

received by Officer Walden in Georgia.  It's about funds 

13

that were seized in Georgia, that remained in Georgia. 

14

It was prepared in Georgia, forwarded to an AUSA in 

15

Georgia, for forfeiture proceedings in Georgia. 

16

 And so the two cases could not be more 

17

different.  Just as the focal point of the tortious 

18

activity in Calder was on the State of California, here, 

19

the focus of the tortious activity was on the State of 

20

Georgia. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Did the affidavit ever get 

to Nevada? 
 MS. SHERRY: 

It didn't get to Nevada.  Based 

24

on Respondents' own allegations, it was sent to an AUSA 

25

in Georgia for forfeiture proceedings in Georgia.  And,

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

notably, had Respondents wanted to regain their property 

2

during the 6 months' period of seizure, they would have 

3

had to go to Georgia to do so. 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do we know how much of the 

5

information  the supplemental information that was 

6

prepared in Nevada and then was forwarded to Georgia, 

7

how much of that information was in the affidavit? 

8
9

 MS. SHERRY: 

Based on the current record, I 

don't know that we do.  If you look at the complaint 

10

allegations, they suggest that the  what they call the 

11

"exculpatory information" was left out of the affidavit. 

12

The affidavit itself, if it even exists, is not in the 

13

record in this case. 

14

 And then  you know, by focusing  you asked 

15

the question, Your Honor, about what the gravamen of 

16

this case is.  I think, in a very real way, the gravamen 

17

of the case is the initial seizure.  The Ninth Circuit 

18

focused exclusively on the affidavit, and Respondents do 

19

so here as well. 

20

 But I think it's a quintessential example of 

21

the tail wagging the dog.  The affidavit is, at best, a 

22

thin and artificial read.  Even if you were to focus 

23

exclusively on the affidavit, as I explained 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it was  it was 

stated as a separate claim, and I think Judge Grisholm

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

read it that way, and I don't think Petitioner has taken 

2

issue with that, that there's  one claim is for the 

3

seizure, another claim is for the false affidavit.  So 

4

the seizure stops the funds immediately, and then the 

5

false affidavit keeps them there. 

6

 So I didn't think there was a  a genuine 

7

difference between the parties on whether the 

8

affidavit  knowingly composing a false affidavit is an 

9

independent claim. 

10

 MS. SHERRY: 

There isn't for purposes of 

11

of this case in this Court, and I don't mean to suggest 

12

otherwise, but while there may be a distinct claim, 

13

there is no distinct injury.  The injury that 

14

Respondents allege based on the affidavit is simply that 

15

the initial seizure continued beyond the time that it 

16

otherwise would have. 

17

 And for that reason, the harm  the same 

18

economic harm that they were already feeling in Nevada, 

19

continued beyond a certain person point in time. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But imagine a case where 

21

everybody agreed that the initial seizure was lawful, so 

22

that that wasn't part of the complaint at all, and the 

23

only complaint was that a false affidavit had been 

24

filed, so that, after making the preliminary 

25

investigation, the officer hadn't transferred the money,

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

but had, instead, kept it. 
 MS. SHERRY: 

And, again, I  obviously, 

3

that's not this case, but I don't think that case would 

4

be any different because, assuming that the affidavit 

5

looks the same as it's alleged to look in this case, it 

6

would still be focused  that money in Georgia and 

7

everything about it would still be related to Georgia. 

8
9

 Again, the only connection to Nevada would 
be the fact that Respondents felt some harm in that 

10

State.  It's not a harm that's unique in any respect to 

11

Nevada.  It's a harm that they would have felt no matter 

12

where they traveled.  If they had gone to their other 

13

residence in California, if they had left on another 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And that would be true, even 

if the Respondents had never been in Georgia? 
 MS. SHERRY: 

No.  I think it's  I think 

17

it's significant, here, that the Respondents did go to 

18

Georgia.  I mean, here, we are talking about a traveling 

19

Plaintiff  a mobile Plaintiff, who voluntarily left 

20

their home State and traveled to other States, traveled 

21

to New Jersey, traveled to San Juan, and traveled to 

22

Walden's home State, the place where he lives and works, 

23

and brought their cash with them there. 

24
25

 And so I think it is significant that they 
did travel to the State of Georgia, and I think it shows

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

how broad the Ninth Circuit ruling really is.  As far as 

2

law enforcement officers, go, Federal, State, or 

3

local, this is a really problematic decision because 

4

they interact with travelers from all 50 States and 

5

beyond on a daily basis. 

6

 The idea that, based on those interactions, 

7

that they can be hauled into a faraway and distant 

8

forum, based on nothing more than their interaction with 

9

a traveler and finding out where that person is from, 

10

which, of course, unlike this case  the facts here are 

11

somewhat unique, in that the drivers' licenses that were 

12

showed were not from the State of Nevada. 

13
14
15

 In most cases, when travelers show a 
driver's license, it's from their State of residence. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you think it's relevant 

16

in a case like this whether the  the Federal officer 

17

who is sued is represented by the Justice Department? 

18

 MS. SHERRY: 

I don't think it's relevant at 

19

all.  I would point Your Honor to the Court's decision 

20

in Stafford v. Briggs.  In that case  it's a venue 

21

case.  It's about 1391(e).  In that case, the dissent 

22

made an argument that that provision should extend to 

23

personal capacity cases against government officials. 

24
25

 And one of the arguments made is there's 
really not much of a burden on them because they have

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

DOJ representation and because they have 

2

indemnification.  And the majority there rejected that 

3

argument. 

4

 I think it's equally implausible here, and I 

5

think it's significant that, not only did the Ninth 

6

Circuit rely on the fact of DOJ representation, which, 

7

mind you, is not a guarantee, it's a discretionary 

8

determination; but not only did they rely on it, they 

9

relied on it to say that there would be personal 

10

jurisdiction here because this is a Federal official 

11

or, really, a State official deputized as a Federal 

12

official. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Sherry, just to try to 

14

figure out how far your argument goes, suppose there's 

15

an IRS agent sitting in Washington, D.C., and she 

16

maliciously does something, files an affidavit, does 

17

whatever she does, to impose a tax penalty on somebody 

18

in Nevada, and everything that she does happens in 

19

Washington, D.C. 

20

 Does the person in Nevada, who is the victim 

21

of this malicious attempt to impose a tax penalty, have 

22

to go to Washington, D.C., to sue her? 

23

 MS. SHERRY: 

I think there's more difficult 

24

questions there, where the individual hasn't left the 

25

State at all and where it's targeted at the State.  I

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think that comes to Your Honor's question about what it 

2

means 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, she's a very mobile 

4

person.  She lives in Nevada, but she goes other places, 

5

and  and this could  you know, harm her wherever she 

6

goes.  Isn't that what you said?  So why should she be 

7

able to bring suit in Nevada, under your view? 

8
9

 MS. SHERRY: 

That is what I said and  I 

think maybe it goes to Your Honor's other question, 

10

earlier, about what it means to expressly aim your 

11

conduct at the forum State, as opposed to just the forum 

12

resident, when we're talking about an intentional tort. 

13

 In the cases that have looked at this, 

14

they've  they have looked for something more besides 

15

simply aiming your conduct at a forum resident, some 

16

indication that the  that the defendant is trying to 

17

reach into the forum State.  And some of the examples 

18

that have come up is when they've actually sent 

19

something into the forum State, whether it's a 

20

defamatory article or a letter, the bullet example 

21

that's in the restatement and mentioned in the briefs. 

22

 In those cases, the defendant is actually sending 

23

something physically into the State or, for example, 

24

directing activity in the forum State  directing 

25

something to happen in the forum State.

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Whatever the answer is to the  to that 

2

hypothetical, the facts here are really quite different. 

3

Walden didn't do anything to reach into the State of 

4

Nevada.  And as my colleague pointed out, the only 

5

connection to Nevada and the idea that the money was 

6

going to be returned there and eventually was returned 

7

there is entirely fortuitous. 

8
9
10
11

 It's based entirely on the unilateral acts 
of the plaintiff, the fact that they happened to hire a 
Las Vegas attorney.  If they hired 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Ms. Sherry, you  would 

12

you want us to decide this case on the jurisdictional 

13

question or the venue question? 

14
15
16
17

 MS. SHERRY: 

The Court, I think, can do 

either.  My preference would be 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I understand that. 

That's why I asked the question. 

18

 (Laughter.) 

19

 MS. SHERRY: 

My  my preference would be 

20

that  the same as Petitioner's, that the Court decide 

21

it on personal jurisdiction grounds, and the reasons are 

22

the ones expressed in the Federal Law Enforcement 

23

Officer brief. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What  what type of 

action would the United States have brought if they

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decided to bring an action?  It would have been in 

2

personam or in rem against the assets? 

3

 MS. SHERRY: 

It would have been an in rem 

4

action against the assets.  It would have been a 

5

forfeiture complaint that would have been filed in 

6

Georgia.  And in those proceedings, the Respondents 

7

would have had an opportunity to contest the forfeiture. 

8
9

 If during either the pendency of those 
proceedings or even before those proceedings, if they 

10

had wanted to seek to regain control of their property, 

11

they would have had to file a motion or a petition in 

12

the State of Georgia.  They wouldn't have been able to 

13

file one in their home State.  And, again, those are the 

14

statutes that we cite at page 31 of our brief. 

15

 The consequence of the Ninth Circuit's 

16

decision here really is to allow personal jurisdiction, 

17

as well as venue, to travel with a mobile plaintiff in a 

18

way that it cannot travel with mobile chattel. 

19

 We've talked mostly about personal 

20

jurisdiction here, but could I  if I could just take a 

21

quick moment on venue and point the Court to this  to 

22

the Leroy decision in 1979.  Nobody contests that there 

23

would be no venue in the District of Nevada under the 

24

Leroy decision. 

25

 The language change in 1990 does nothing to

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

change that and does nothing to change the result in 

2

Leroy.  Respondents avoid the statutory text, and I 

3

think it resolves this case.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

10

it please the Court: 

11

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 You are being asked by the other side to 

12

write an opinion about personal jurisdiction that is 

13

going to try and slice the salami very, very, very thin, 

14

that is going to create a huge amount of confusion about 

15

these facts versus the facts in Calder and that is going 

16

to be very, very difficult to reconcile with the 

17

internet cases and the cases that the lower courts are 

18

constantly confronting, about where a person in State A 

19

intentionally injures a person in State B. 

20

 And that person frequently doesn't shoot a 

21

gun into the other State.  They sit at their computer, 

22

and they steal money under the bank account.  They take 

23

the person's ID.  They use their credit cards and the 

24

like. 

25

 I think, in truth, the way the case is most

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

likely to be resolved 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They didn't really injure a 

3

person in State B here.  I mean, these people were in 

4

Georgia when the injury occurred. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Scalia, we disagree, 

6

and so let me focus on your point and Justice Kennedy's 

7

question about which claim it is.  The claim here  the 

8

complaint states two complaints, Judge Berzon 

9

recognized.  One is about the seizure. 

10

 It's exactly what you are describing. 

The 

11

other is about the false affidavit.  And those really 

12

are different as a matter of law.  I have a couple of 

13

citations to give you to explain how this legal process 

14

works. 

15

 What happens is the DEA seizes the money at 

16

the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport.  He takes the cash and 

17

turns it in to a locker.  Then what happens is that we 

18

have to state a claim to the money.  And when we state a 

19

claim to the money, they either have to do one of two 

20

things:  They have to give it back to us as a matter of 

21

law, or they have to start a forfeiture process as a 

22

matter of law. 

23

 And if you start the forfeiture process, you 

24

have to provide to the assistant U.S. attorney a factual 

25

basis for the forfeiture.  And the way to look at this,

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I think, is the way that Justice Kagan's hypothetical 

2

asked, and that is imagine that there were two officers 

3

here, not one. 

4

 Officer A  we'll call him Walden  is at 

5

the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport, and he seizes our money. 

6

And just assume that that's perfectly lawful.  We then 

7

state a claim to the money, and then we provide factual 

8

information about why it is that the money is not 

9

subject to seizure.  They have to return it to us at 

10

that point, or they have to start the forfeiture 

11

process. 

12

 And when that second officer creates a false 

13

affidavit to start the forfeiture process, we are not in 

14

Georgia.  We have no ongoing contacts with Georgia.  And 

15

we are losing access to the money only in Nevada. 

16

That's the only place we're in 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, suppose that the 

18

plaintiffs in this case were not professional gamblers. 

19

Let's say they were Major League umpires, or they are 

20

members of a rock group that's going on a tour of 25 

21

cities. 

22

 Where would there be personal jurisdiction 

23

there?  In every place where the umpire was going to 

24

appear at a game?  Every place where the group was going 

25

to perform?

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, sir.  The lower courts 

2

have tackled this question because people go visit their 

3

motherinlaw.  They do travel around.  It's a mobile 

4

society, and they have taken, from your opinion in 

5

Calder and Jones, the focus on where it is that the 

6

plaintiff lives and works.  And there is a good reason 

7

for that. 

8

 Personal jurisdiction is trying to tackle 

9

the question of where does the defendant reasonably 

10

believe that he will be haled into court.  It's a 

11

fairness principle.  And that is, we need to have a 

12

predictable rule that allows the wouldbe defendants to 

13

know, okay, if I do this 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, here, the  here, the 

15

plaintiffs apparently lived in two places, right? 

16

California and Nevada. 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That is 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And suppose my hypothetical 

19

rock performer has five houses, one in California, one 

20

in Montana, and so forth.  He  personal jurisdiction 

21

everywhere? 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, sir.  The  and let me 

23

just start with the premise of this case, all right?  My 

24

friend said that this officer was shown the 

25

California  California driver's license.  That's not

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

correct.  He wasn't shown a California driver's license. 
 The officer in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was 

3

shown one.  They only  their principal residence, the 

4

complaint alleges, I think, in paragraph 2, is in 

5

Nevada.  We do have situations  and that's where they 

6

lived and worked.  We have situations 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, they were sufficiently 

8

residents of California to get California driver's 

9

licenses, were they not? 

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

11
12

That is true, at one point, 

and they had moved. 
 I'm going to step outside the record, just 

13

so I can accurately answer your question.  But it will 

14

give you a sense of how these cases actually operate. 

15

 Most often, you have the situation where 

16

they're college students  you know, you have a college 

17

student who lives at home with their parents, but they 

18

go off to college, and they may be injured where it is 

19

that they live and go to school in that case. 

20

 And what the lower courts do is, sensibly, 

21

they say, if you know where the person's principal 

22

residence is  and this case is simplified by the fact 

23

that the district court understood and assumed that the 

24

defendant knew that they lived in Nevada.  It's never 

25

been contested in the case.

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And Judge Berzon said, quite correctly, what 

2

you have to do is you have to make it a prima facie case 

3

because there's no evidence in this case that the 

4

that the principal residence was Nevada and that the 

5

defendant knew that. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you're really arguing 

7

for a very broad principle.  Whenever there is an 

8

intentional tort, you can be haled into court at the 

9

place of residence of the person against whom the tort 

10

is committed. 

11

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13
14

No, sir.  I'm sorry 
No, that's what I thought 

you were saying. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  Then I've  I've 

15

misled you, and let me state our test, which I haven't 

16

done yet, and that may help you.  Our rule is as 

17

follows:  When the defendant intentionally targets the 

18

plaintiff for injury in State A, where the injury 

19

arises  and that's going to be the big difference. 

20

Does the injury arise there? 

21

 Justice Scalia, your impression in your 

22

earlier question was that this injury didn't arise in 

23

Nevada.  But our test requires that it arise in Nevada, 

24

and the defendant knows that it's going to arise in 

25

Nevada.

33

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 I'll contrast our  our false seizure 

2

claim, right?  We were in the airport.  We lose the 

3

$97,000.  If we then go back to Nevada and then file 

4

suit, our injury can't travel with us.  And that's the 

5

big concern of 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I don't see how it 

7

arises in Nevada.  What they're saying is that some 

8

people in Georgia didn't give back some money that they 

9

took in Georgia.  To take your example, my question is 

10

this:  There could  you say there are many, many, many 

11

cases.  We could get this all mixed up if we don't 

12

follow your rules. 

13

 All I want you to do is cite me a few, but 

14

the few that I want you to cite me will meet certain 

15

criteria. 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay. 
For example, a college 

18

student goes into the bookstore, and it's also a 

19

pharmacy, by the way.  And he breaks his finger in the 

20

door.  Which he thinks is his fault.  He says, I am going home; send 

21

me some bandages.  The store never does.  Send me some 

22

books, I just bought them.  The store never does.  They 

23

know his home address, all right?  Injury  now, what 

24

about those? 

25

 Cite me some lower cases where they say

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there is jurisdiction in cases like that. 

2

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I have not seen 
Oh, I lost my billfold.  I 

4

lost it here in the store.  When you find it, will you 

5

send it back?  They never send it back, though they 

6

found it.  All right.  So just give me some lower court 

7

cases that finds jurisdiction in that kind of situation. 

8

10
11

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

In that kind of situation, 

where the injury actually  and you have named several 
situations. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no, the injury  my 

12

goodness, he lost his billfold.  There was money in it. 

13

And by the way, when he gets home, his parents are away, 

14

and he's not going to have any money to spend on food or 

15

even, like, CDs or anything. 

16

 (Laughter.) 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

So, Justice Breyer, it is 

18

our position that, in that situation, there is not 

19

personal jurisdiction.  And let me try 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

There is no jurisdiction in 

21

those cases where he lost his billfold in the bookstore 

22

in the college town, 1,000 miles away from home, and 

23

he's going home, and everybody knows he's never going to 

24

have any money, and they keep the money. 

25

 Okay. 

What's the difference?  If there are

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

no cases on those, what is the difference between that 

2

case and yours? 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  The difference is 

4

that the defendant in that instance, the injury arises 

5

at the bookstore.  Okay?  And the fact that it has a 

6

continuing effect, as a practical matter, the lower 

7

courts uniformly treat the injury arising as in the 

8

bookstore. 

9

 But there are situations that you can 

10

imagine the following:  And that is, he loses the 

11

billfold in the store.  Okay.  That injury arose there. 

12

Now, someone takes the credit card from the billfold 

13

after he has gone home, knows that he's at home, and 

14

starts spending his money with it.  That injury arises 

15

where he lives. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

case that says that. 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  Now, give me the 

Okay.  The cases that are 

19

closest to that  two of them are at page 25a of the 

20

petition appendix.  They are the Bancroft case, and 

21

that  these are not going to be billfold cases.  Okay? 

22

Billfold cases, people tend not to  if you lose $100, 

23

people don't file a lawsuit.  These are bigger cases. 

24
25

 And it's the petition appendix. 

You've 

pulled open the red brief, so I am asking you for the

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cert petition.  The Bancroft case at 25a is where a 

2

Georgia resident writes to a Virginia registrar, and the 

3

registrar misappropriates the website of a California 

4

company.  And that is, they never set foot in 

5

California.  They don't  you know, do anything in 

6

California at all. 

7

 And there, there is jurisdiction in 

8

California because they know that the person's going to 

9

be hurt in California. 

10

 The next one is Metropolitan Life, that 

11

the same page, an Alabama resident writes to an 

12

insurance company, and they say, Ah, I'm entitled to the 

13

insurance proceeds.  But the actual proceeds belong to 

14

someone in California.  And they never get the money. 

15

So it's like this case.  The money never gets sent into 

16

California. 

17

 And these remote injury cases 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19

Is this a case  is this a 

case like  I'll look at those cases. 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay. 
But is your case a case 

22

like where the  a credit card is used, somebody finds 

23

it in a bookstore and starts spending the money and did 

24

the agents here, who were outside Nevada and they were 

25

keeping the money, were they going and spending it?

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

2

spending it.  They were 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4

that they were using? 

5

They weren't going and 

Was there a credit card 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, sir.  I  I am giving 

6

you  I was trying to take a billfold example and 

7

I'm  I'm trying to 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I was trying to figure out 

just which cases I should read carefully, and I will 
read those cases. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  And there's a case 

12

that's discussed in several of the briefs called 

13

Dudnikov, and that involves an  an eBay  eBaylike 

14

auction, and someone in one State blocks an auction in 

15

another State. 

16

 So one of the impressions 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

Georgia the whole time? 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21
22

Was the money here in 

The money here was 
Was it still there in that 

locker? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No.  Here's the thing about 

23

it, this is no longer about the cash.  And this  the 

24

actual answer to your question is he turns the money in 

25

at a locker, okay?  Then it's deposited into an account.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It's not about the physical money in any way, shape, or 

2

form at that point. 

3

 We weren't  when we got the money, nobody 

4

sent us a duffle bag full of cash.  There was a check, 

5

of course. 

6
7

Well, if it were about 


 JUSTICE KAGAN: 
them 

8

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 


9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So  so suppose they seized 


10

a gold watch 

11

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay. 


12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 and then they refused to 


13

return the gold watch. 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 


15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But the gold watch really is 


16

still sitting there in Georgia. 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Okay?  Would you say that 

19

that then there's  there's personal jurisdiction in 

20

Nevada? 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  Okay.  And same 

22

facts, and that is a false affidavit, it's not just they 

23

seized it, it's they make a false 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yeah, they seize it, and 

then there's a false affidavit keeping it.

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right.  Yes.  That 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And the complaint is only 

3

about the false affidavit, but it's in reference to 

4

property that is indisputably in Georgia. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes.  I do think, if you can 

6

prove an injury, which I think is very hard from the 

7

gold watch  let's say a computer, just to make it a 

8

little bit more plausible, that they would be hurt in 

9

Nevada, then, yes, I do think if you can make out an 

10

injury, which isn't  the tort doesn't arise until the 

11

injury occurs. 

12
13
14
15

 That's why the lower courts treat these 
cases as the tort occurring where the victim is. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Goldstein, can I take 

you back to the origins of all of this? 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
The main move for 

18

personal jurisdiction, traditionally, is the plaintiff 

19

must go to where the defendant is, no matter how 

20

inconvenient that is for the plaintiff.  Jurisdiction is 

21

defendantcentered.  You're trying to hold a defendant, 

22

you have to go where he is. 

23

 Then the longarm age comes about, and we 

24

have specific jurisdiction, which, by the way, is what 

25

you're urging.

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3

Yes. 
You're certainly not saying 

they have allpurpose jurisdiction over Walden. 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

No.  Correct. 
And this Court, as the 

6

McIntyre decision indicates, has been pretty careful 

7

about specific jurisdiction.  And Miguel wasn't enough 

8

that machine blew up or cut somebody's fingers in New 

9

Jersey.  They had to purposely avail themselves of 

10
11

wherever the  the standard words are. 
 And here, you're asking for  really 

12

pushing this specific jurisdiction to the limit.  The 

13

defendant has acted only in Georgia.  He hasn't set foot 

14

outside the State. 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  So I don't think we 

16

are trying to push the bounds  let me make one point 

17

about McIntyre and then try and correct the 

18

misimpression that I think that's been left, that there 

19

are a few contacts between Nevada and this case and 

20

hopefully prove to you that there are far more contacts 

21

between this tort and this forum than will be true in 

22

the overwhelming majority of cases that the lower courts 

23

confront. 

24
25

 And the point I would make, Justice 
Ginsburg, and it's made by the plurality in McIntyre, is

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that there have always been special rules for 

2

intentional tort cases.  That's the distinction, and 

3

that's why Calder comes out the way it does, citing 

4

restatement Section 32nd of the second  the second 

5

restatement of the conflict of laws, and that is the 

6

reason  it's not just made up. 

7

 The reason there's a special rule for 

8

intentional torts is that the defendant knows he's 

9

hurting someone somewhere else and, therefore, expects 

10

to be haled into court.  The view of the McIntyre 

11

plurality, of course, was that the overseas manufacturer 

12

there wasn't, itself, doing anything directed at the 

13

forum. 

14
15
16
17

 But if I could just get to the very 
important point about 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Before you move on from that 

point 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

 your  your argument is 

20

dependent on the fact that the officer here knew that 

21

the  the plaintiffs were residents of Nevada; is that 

22

right? 

23
24
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That they lived and worked 

there. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why should that make any

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

difference?  The conduct is the same; the injury is the 

2

same.  What if he didn't know?  Then there would be no 

3

personal jurisdiction. 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That  that is actually, 

5

generally, what the lower courts hold, and their reason 

6

is that the defendant is doing something, knowing that 

7

he may be haled into that court.  It is a 

8

defendantfavoring rule that intends  attempts to give 

9

predictability. 

10

 Now, if that's wrong, it doesn't hurt my 

11

case because, as the case comes to you, it's not 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you could say that 

13

about whatever rule we adopt.  Once we adopt the rule, 

14

when  the defendant will know that, if he violates 

15

that rule, he's going to be haled into court. 

16
17
18
19
20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Scalia, there is 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, it's sort of a 

a 

selffulfilling point you're making. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right.  It's almost like the 

21

Fourth Amendment reasonable expectations to privacy. 

22

There is a circularity here.  But it's not entirely 

23

circular because we're talking about a specific State 

24

here.  It's not that he knows that the plaintiffs might 

25

be  live in Georgia or might live anywhere in the

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

United States, it's a very specific State, and that's 

2

why it's not circular. 

3

 Now, if I could just help you understand our 

4

view that there are a lot more contacts between this 

5

tort and Nevada than in the great, great  at least 

6

90 percent of the cases the lower courts are 

7

confronting.  So here are the points that I would make 

8

about those contexts, and there are six, and I will try 

9

and be brief. 

10

 The case involves money owned by Nevada 

11

residents, $30,000 of which originated in Nevada, and 

12

all of which was on its way to Nevada. 

13

 Second, the defendant intentionally hurt the 

14

plaintiffs, knowing that they would lose access to the 

15

money in Nevada, where they lived and worked. 

16

 Third, we will use documents in Nevada to 

17

prove that his action was intentional because it omitted 

18

the information that the defendant requested.  This is 

19

not a  us unilaterally sending money.  At the Atlanta 

20

airport, he said, send us the proof that the funds are 

21

legitimate, that he requested and received from the 

22

plaintiffs in Nevada and that he learned in searching a 

23

Nevada law enforcement database, which is paragraph 79 

24

of the complaint. 

25

 The two last points I would make is that the

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiffs will show that they were deprived of the 


2


money in Nevada until the Nevada lawyer they had to hire 

3

used records in Nevada to persuade the government to 


4


send the money to Nevada. 


5


 And the plaintiffs in their case, of course, 

6

will show, because it is the fact that they are gamblers 

7

working in Las Vegas, that the economic injury occurred 

8

to them there. 

9

 Now, if you think that's not enough, if you 

10

conclude that's not enough, you are closing the door 

11

absolutely to all of the internet cases because those 

12

are cases where someone sits at the computer and targets 

13

someone in another State.  This 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But, when you're talking 

15

about the internet, you're in a different world.  But 

16

this is a  the facts here are oldfashioned. 

17

Everything that happened here could have happened in 

18

1920. 


19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 


Yes. 


20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 


Could have happened in  in 


21

the 19th century. 


22


 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 


23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So I don't see what the 


24
25

internet has to do with this. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Alito, you always

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

tell us that you've got to write a legal rule, and there 

2

is no special personal jurisdiction rule, and the lower 

3

courts 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  Well, there seems to 

5

be because it's hard to think of an internet case where 

6

a defendant wouldn't be having communications with 

7

people in the foreign State, wouldn't be inviting 

8

business, wouldn't be doing all kinds of things. 

9

 So there are many kinds of internet cases, 

10

but I don't  I don't automatically see, in deciding 

11

this, that we're deciding any on 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Breyer, the kinds of 

13

internet cases  and it's wrong for me to just say, 

14

"internet"  the kinds of cases that I'm talking about 

15

are the fraud cases, the intentional tort cases 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Like what? 
You steal  you're sitting 

18

in Georgia  you don't, but someone is sitting in 

19

Georgia, and they steal the identity of someone who's in 

20

Nevada. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

24
25

I wouldn't do that. 

I'm  exactly  that's why 

I took it immediately back, recognizing the error. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

He wouldn't know how.

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

But there are bad people in 

3

the world, obviously, and those people do, with 

4

increasing and distressing frequency at  with these 

5

new tools of communication, they are very, very capable 

6

of causing significant harm to someone else without 

7

actually do  setting foot in the State. 

8
9

 Now, I have to offer you a solution. 

Let me 

just be clear.  I recognize that this can go either way 

10

because if I say, "internet cases," well, then I'm 

11

opening the door to potentially a very wideranging set 

12

of cases going into Nevada, and we have here the special 

13

case of the law enforcement officer, and I believe that 

14

I do have the solution. 

15

 And that is, this is actually a case about 

16

transfer.  It is not a case about jurisdiction and 

17

venue.  This is the unusual case where the defendant 

18

filed a motion to dismiss and did not file a 1404 motion 

19

to transfer. 

20

 And this case is a lot  you should treat 

21

it like Atlantic Marine because what you need to do is 

22

recognize, I think, that there's the big category of 

23

jurisdiction.  Where there is jurisdiction, there's a 

24

subset, there is venue.  That's where you can file a 

25

lawsuit.  That is not where the case is going to be

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

litigated. 
 And in these cases, what defendants 

3

uniformly do  and the lower courts pay incredible 

4

attention to the fact that law enforcement officers are 

5

going to be witnesses or are the defendant.  In these 

6

cases, the defendant comes in and says, okay, I 

7

recognize, technically, there's jurisdiction and venue, 

8

but let me tell you how disruptive it will be if I 

9

actually have to litigate the case here. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I don't understand 

11

what you're saying.  You're saying that we should 

12

reverse the Ninth Circuit's dismiss  the dismissal and 

13

send it back for the district court to consider whether 

14

the case should be transferred? 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, sir.  I would not 

16

this is my judgment.  I do not want it reversed.  What 

17

I'm saying 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I know that, so that's why 

I'm confused by what you're saying about transfer. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I'm trying to describe an 

21

opinion that you would write, and the opinion that I 

22

think you would write is this  and it says, look, 

23

personal jurisdiction in the wake of Calder, 

24

particularly where there are contacts here, exists. 

25

Venue exists because several of these are events and

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

omissions, including the injury that occurs in Nevada. 

2

 But what we expect the lower courts to do in 

3

a case like this is to pay particular attention at the 

4

beginning of the case, as we do with qualified immunity, 

5

to have an efficient process in which the defendant can 

6

say 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you are asking the 

8

Court to decide a bigticket item, personal 

9

jurisdiction, and what  the theory that you are 

10

proposing would apply not to  just to Officer Walden, 

11

but it would be about as far out as any specific 

12

jurisdiction case I know. 

13

 So the Court shouldn't say, well, 

14

jurisdiction, okay, venue, okay, but consider it 

15

transferring it to Georgia.  That seems, to me, wild. 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Ginsburg, I am not 

17

trying to just skip over.  I have talked for this entire 

18

time about why I think we are right on jurisdiction and 

19

venue, and I am pleased to return to the issue.  What 

20

I'm suggesting to you is that I recognize that we can't 

21

have  there are two ways of dealing with the prospect 

22

of a broad personal jurisdiction rule. 

23

 One is to narrow it substantially. 

The 

24

second is to recognize that it doesn't determine where 

25

the case is going to ultimately be litigated.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 I will tell you, Justice Ginsburg, from 

2

personally reviewing all of the postCalder cases in the 

3

Federal courts and the State courts, that the contacts 

4

here are much, much greater between Nevada and this tort 

5

than exists in the great majority of cases that the 

6

lower courts are confronting. 

7

 And so if you 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

9

Did  did Calder have 

something to do with the notion that every defamation 

10

is  that every publication is a tort where it occurs? 

11

There is something special about the libel cases.  There 

12

was that theory that, wherever the paper that contains 

13

the libelous article  wherever it is sent, each one of 

14

those places, the tort occurs there. 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Two things about that.  That 

16

is the rule for torts, not specifically  it does  it 

17

is true of libel, but it is true, as well, of fraud. 

18

The fraud occurs where the person is defrauded.  This is 

19

straight from the Restatement.  It's the ordinary common 

20

law rule.  So the tort does happen where the victim is 

21

injured in libel and in a case like 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, but you are libeled 

23

wherever it is published.  You don't have to be there 

24

where it's published.  You are libeled wherever it is 

25

published.

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

And, Justice  that's 

2

correct.  And, Justice Scalia, this is exactly why 

3

you were asking the question, why is it that 

4

thenJustice Rehnquist's opinion in Calder has the 

5

discussion that the other side is focusing on about how 

6

the article was centered on California and how it came 

7

from California sources. 

8
9

 Now, none of the holding of the case 
describes it, but you wondered  and he has emphasized, 

10

my friend has, why is it in the opinion?  And it's for 

11

the reason you have just given.  And that is defamation 

12

and libel cases, when you are talking about the 

13

publication to the internet or publication nationwide 

14

like the National Enquirer, the lower courts have 

15

rightly focused on the fact, can we say that this isn't 

16

just directed to the United States? 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So  so you could say that 

18

Calder, far from being an expansive decision, was a 

19

narrowing decision.  It said  you know, there's 

20

jurisdiction not necessarily everywhere where the libel 

21

was published, which is where the injury occurs, but 

22

there is jurisdiction only  only in California, where 

23

these other connections existed. 

24
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

We are saying the same 

thing.  I'm just not explaining my view of it well

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

enough, and that is  the 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3
4

Except it's harder for you 

to establish that the injury occurred in Nevada. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I don't think so, and let me 

5

try my best.  All right.  The reason these defamation 

6

cases about internet and national publications  say 

7

the New York Times is sued for defamation. 

8

 The Court was very concerned and the lower 

9

courts are very concerned that the publisher can't be 

10

sued in all 50 States.  And so what the lowers courts 

11

have done in the wake of Calder is say, I know you 

12

published it to the whole country, National Enquirer, 

13

but is it fair to say you expected to be haled into 

14

court in California because there were special features 

15

about this defamation. 

16

 Now, defamation and nationwide publication 

17

is very different from the other torts the lower courts 

18

confront, which, as was suggested in the first 30 

19

minutes of questioning, I think, by Justice Kagan, are 

20

directed at a person, the "shoot the gun" example, the 

21

"defraud the victim" example. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But our jurisdiction cases 

23

have not been based on where you expected to be sued. 

24

You could expect to be sued anywhere if the State says 

25

you are going to be sued here.

 Our cases have focused on whether the State 

2

has jurisdiction, whether the State has enough 

3

connection with it to assert its power; not the 

4

expectation of the defendant, but the power of the 

5

State.  That's what's going on here. 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Scalia, I agree with 

7

you, but I will say in my defense that, when the Court 

8

has said  when we are trying to figure out if there 

9

are minimum contacts and whether it's consistent with 

10

fair play and substantial justice, the language the 

11

Court has used is, is it fair, because the defendant 

12

could reasonably be expected  could reasonably expect 

13

to be haled into the court. 

14

 That's true of purposeful availment cases 

15

like McIntyre.  It's true of intentional tort cases. 

16

And that is, we measure fairness and whether you are 

17

getting process that is due to you procedurally by 

18

whether this is something that you could expect to 

19

happen to you 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's your new test, just 

whether you could expect this to happen? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, sir.  No, sir.  I have 

23

given you a specific test about where you have to 

24

intentionally injure the person, knowing that they will be 

25

injured there, and the injury has to arise there.

53

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 And as I've said, the way in intentional 

2

tort cases that has to work is that the lower courts 

3

recognize that a tort has a wrong and an injury, and the 

4

injury is what makes the tort complete and the tort 

5

occurs where the victim is. 

6

 Just take the "shoot the gun" example, 

7

right?  The reason is that the person is injured there. 

8

It doesn't have to be that you shoot the gun, that the 

9

bullet travels across the State line, because the same 

10

thing can happen when money is taken out of your bank 

11

account. 

12
13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What is the  what are the 

elements of the  of the second tort? 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

15

fraud claim.  And that 

Yes.  It is essentially a 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And what is the element? 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That he knowingly submitted 

18

information that caused the government not to send us 

19

the money.  False 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Injury element? 
Yes.  That is 
How do I find that? 

23

Because you see, in the fraud case, the element includes 

24

the victims being misled. 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes.  That's 

54

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But that's not necessarily 

true here.  I wonder 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, it's actually not the 

4

case that the victim has to be misled in fraud, 

5

Justice Breyer, so for example

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

15

Yes, a knowing 

misrepresentation. 

10

14

It has to be a 

 material to. 
Yes. 
Material to? 
Here, to the government's 

decision 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Not here, but material 

16

to  normally, it has to be material to the obtaining 

17

the, say, of property. 

18
19
20
21
22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right.  Or the refusal to 

return. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now, where do I find the 

elements of the tort that you are alleging here? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The tort that we are 

23

alleging here is essentially common law fraud under 

24

Bivens.  I can give you citations 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't see anything in the

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

complaint that says anything like that.  It just says 

2

where  where do I look to see it? 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  The citations to the 

4

complaint about  it would be paragraphs 99 to 101. 

5

"It's alleged to violate the Fourth Amendment and our 

6

due process rights to have submitted the false affidavit 

7

that caused the government not to send us the money." 

8

 And if you were to conclude, Justice Scalia, 

9

that this injury doesn't arise here  let me just tell 

10

you what the consequences of that are.  And that is 

11

there are a large number of cases that arise constantly 

12

where people lose access to money, where they don't have 

13

the insurance proceeds sent to them or the Social 

14

Security checks or the IRS refunds. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Goldstein, as I 

16

understood what Mr. Bucholtz was saying, he was saying 

17

there is a distinction between an officer who commits a 

18

fraud in Georgia, when your money is in Nevada, and so 

19

he commits a fraud and he freezes your bank accounts in 

20

Nevada, versus he commits a fraud by filing this 

21

affidavit. 

22

 But it is as to money that is located where 

23

he is, not where you are, but where he is in Georgia. 

24

That's the distinction that I understood him to be 

25

drawing.

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right. 


2


 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

What do you think about 


3

4


that? 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It doesn't make any 


5


practical sense to me, and the money wasn't in Georgia. 

6

The money was in an account in Quantico, Virginia that 

7

belonged to the DEA. 

8

 What difference does it make as a matter of 

9

personal jurisdiction between the following two cases 

10

and that is the defendant sitting in Georgia steals 

11

money from my bank account in Nevada or the defendant 

12

sitting in Georgia causes the government not to send me 

13

the money in Nevada 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Because one of the elements 

15

of the crime in the  in the second case, no element of 

16

the crime or no element of the tort, it's only the 

17

injury, which isn't an element of the actual underlying 

18

behavior that gives rise to, and in the first case, it's 

19

the other.  There is an element that takes place there. 

20

That's what I'm looking for. 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay. 
I'm looking for that.  I'm 

23

not saying that I have it.  That's why I asked you the 

24

question I did. 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right.  I believe that the

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

elements of the tort that Justice Kagan is describing 

2

are the same elements that I am talking about here. 

3

It's just where the money starts. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

5

What  what if the 

plaintiffs in this case didn't leave Georgia? 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
They said, look, I'm 

8

not leaving until I get my money back, and I'm going to 

9

get my money back as soon as the lawyer sends us the 

10
11

receipts or whatever it is.  Is that a different case? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes, it is a different case, 

12

Mr. Chief Justice.  And the lower courts say the real 

13

question is, where  is this the kind of injury that 

14

will arise where the Plaintiff lives and works.  And any 

15

case 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I thought your 

17

arguments were, basically, it does arise where he lives 

18

and works because it is in Nevada.  And he still lives 

19

and works in Nevada, even if he stays in Georgia and 

20

says, I'm not leaving until I get the money. 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, I  that is  for 

22

example, on our seizure claim, we acknowledge that, at 

23

the very least, there wouldn't be venue.  And there's 

24

another difference, in addition to the fact that they 

25

had returned to Nevada and they had returned to living

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and working. 

2

 And that is, in our actual case, we have the 

3

documents that are sent at his request from Nevada.  We 

4

have the fact that he searches the Nevada law 

5

enforcement databases.  And we have the fact that the 

6

money is going to be sent by the government to Nevada. 

7

 It's requested by their Nevada lawyer, 

8

sending documents from Nevada.  And so those are  if 

9

we think of Calder as a case in which there's not merely 

10

injury in California, but a few extra factors that were 

11

in California, that's much more this case than it is any 

12

of the other cases that the lower courts are 

13

confronting. 

14
15

 I would just discourage the Court, if I 
could, from 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Except, Mr. Goldstein 
Yes. 
 it  it is of no 

19

consequence to Walden whether this person is from Alaska 

20

or Nevada.  In Calder, the article was about a person in 

21

California.  The sources came from California.  The 

22

paper had its principal circulation in California.  It 

23

seems to me there's nothing resembling that in this 

24

case. 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Ginsburg, to my

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mind, what resembles it are the documents that go from 

2

Nevada to the defendant, and we think that's a 

3

specific to the fact that it was a libel and defamation

case.

remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. BUCHOLTZ 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

There was a lot of talk about 

12

intentional torts being different, and  and how there 

13

should be a different rule in intentional torts.  And I 

14

want to start just by  by emphasizing the implications 

15

of that.  The other side is putting all their eggs in 

16

the basket of what's in Officer Walden's mind, 

17

triggering some different personal jurisdiction inquiry. 

18

 And my friend even referred to qualified 

19

immunity by analogy, but I think that analogy is very 

20

important.  And it shows why it would be unworkable to 

21

make personal jurisdiction turn on what's allegedly in 

22

the defendant's mind. 

23

 This Court initially created qualified 

24

immunity on that model as a  as a  based on 

25

subjective good faith.  That turned out not to work

60

because subjective good faith 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Write a  counsel, 

3

write a holding that takes care of your case without 

4

putting at risk the internet cases that he's talking 

5

about. 

6

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Justice Sotomayor, I think 

7

there is absolutely no reason the Court needs to address 

8

internet cases or any other cases involving modern 

9

technology.  This case is  the most modern technology 

10

involved in this case, I think, is a dog sniff at the 

11

airport.  There's just no reason for the Court to 

12

address any of those 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, your adversary 

14

is right.  We write rules that get applied to different 

15

concepts. 

16

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right. 
So write the holding for 

18

me that can't be just plaintiff  defendant's 

19

activities because Calder did more than just defendant's 

20

activities, so write a different  write the holding. 

21

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Of course, Justice Sotomayor. 

22

I understand there has to be a rule, and the rule is 

23

here there is  there's tangible property.  This isn't 

24

a case about property with no realworld presence that 

25

only exists on a server somewhere.

61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 This is a case about cash that was in a bag, 

2

and the bag was in Atlanta, on the plaintiff's person in 

3

Atlanta.  It was seized in Atlanta.  And the only 

4

effect 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm sorry.  So there'd be a 

6

difference if the bag had been shipped to Washington, 

7

D.C.?  And  you know, money is  is fungible.  Money 

8

is everywhere and nowhere.  So it  it seems as though 

9

money is a bit different from a gold watch, that  that 

10

it was  it's only contingent that the money remained 

11

in Atlanta, rather than being shipped to a bank 

12

someplace else. 

13

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, I think it's not 

14

contingent  and from Officer Walden's perspective, I 

15

think it's incidental and contingent that the plaintiffs 

16

happened to be from Nevada, and that's where the effects 

17

of the seizure or the continued seizure or the delay in 

18

return were felt. 

19

 But I think to  to try to answer, Justice 

20

Sotomayor, your question and your question earlier about 

21

freezing a bank account in other kind of electronic 

22

cases or internet cases, where different technologies 

23

are involved, maybe there's a difference between 

24

freezing a bank account in Nevada. 

25

 Maybe that can be said to be something that

62

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

occurs in Nevada  that's reaching into Nevada to cause 

2

a real effect in Nevada, to cause something to happen in 

3

Nevada, which is different from seizing cash in Atlanta, 

4

knowing and failing to return it, knowing that the 

5

failure to return it is going to have an impact wherever 

6

the plaintiffs are, which presumably will include where 

7

they live, which is Nevada and California. 

8

 So maybe there's a way to draw a line 

9

between freezing a bank account in Nevada, or in 

10

Bancroft and Masters and Dudnikov, the cases that my 

11

friend relied on, there were realworld activities 

12

happening in the forum State. 

13

 In Dudnikov, there were goods. 

There 

14

were  there were fabric prints that existed in the 

15

real world.  And they were being  they were in 

16

Colorado, and they were to be sold in Colorado.  And the 

17

defendant 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Could this record or these 

19

complaints be read to support the conclusion that the 

20

injury was substantially altered by the false affidavit, 

21

based on the misuse of the information received from 

22

Nevada? 

23

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, I 

24

think the complaint  again, we're not challenging 

25

the  the reading by the lower courts that there's a

63

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

claim based on the affidavit that's distinct from the 

2

claim based on the seizure.  On the other hand, the 

3

complaint only has a Fourth Amendment claim in it. 

4

That's the only source of law that the complaint relies 

5

on. 

6

 And the Fourth Amendment injury was complete 

7

upon the seizure  upon the search and seizure which 

8

occurred in Atlanta.  The quantum of damages wasn't 

9

known yet at that time because the plaintiffs didn't 

10

know whether they'd get the money back or when or what 

11

might happen inbetween. 

12

 But that Fourth Amendment injury occurred 

13

then and there.  And so the fact that maybe their 

14

consequential damages are higher because they didn't 

15

have the use of the money for longer, as opposed to 

16

shorter, I suppose that could increase their damages. 

17

 But it doesn't fundamentally change the 

18

nature of this case as one that has no meaningful 

19

connection between Officer Walden's conduct, all of 

20

which occurred in Atlanta and  and Nevada. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You say the affidavit 

wouldn't give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim. 
 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

I think Judge Ikuda made that 

24

point below, Justice Scalia, and I would agree with 

25

that, that  that, however, is what the complaint

64

Alderson Reporting Company

2

venue and not on the merits of the  of the complaint.

 MR. BUCHOLTZ: 

The complaint alleges that 

there is this affidavit written in Georgia for the 

10

purpose of seizing funds that were seized in Georgia, 

11

that were to be forfeited in Georgia.  The only 

12

connection to Nevada is the fact that the plaintiffs 

13

allegedly felt the impact there.  Under any of this
