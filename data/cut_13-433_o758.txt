 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

5

Solutions v. Busk. 

6

 Mr. Clement. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAOL D. CLEMENT 

8
9
10

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11

 Going through security as part of the egress 

12

process is a classic postliminary activity that is 

13

noncompensable under the PortaltoPortal Act.  It is 

14

materially similar to the process of checking out at the 

15

end of the day or waiting in line to do so, which is a 

16

quintessential postliminary activity under the Act. 

17

 The Ninth Circuit erred in treating this 

18

time as integral and indispensable to a principal 

19

activity and Respondent's position that the time is 

20

compensable without regard to whether it is an integral 

21

or indispensable activity is more problematic still. 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Clement  excuse me 

can I give you a hypo? 
 Suppose that there's an employer with cash 
registers, and there's a very extensive process for

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

closing out the cash registers, and that extensive 

2

process is to protect against theft.  If it weren't for 

3

that concern, you could close out a cash register much 

4

more quickly.  Or the same for bank tellers or the same 

5

for casino dealers, you know, that there's, like, a 

6

20minute process which is essentially an antitheft 

7

security process.  And it happens at the end of the 

8

shift when the cashier goes off duty. 

9
10
11

 What's the difference between that case and 
going through security in  at Amazon? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I think one difference 

12

is not  I'm not crystal clear that that time would not 

13

be noncompensable because I think that's sort of the 

14

winding down period, which is, I think, with  at least 

15

potentially within the ambit of preliminary and 

16

postliminary activities. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you know, by the way?  I 

18

mean, before you get on to that, do you know how that's 

19

treated under the law?  Because I guess my assumption 

20

was that this kind of period would be treated as 

21

compensable.  But if that's not right, let me know. 

22

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, it's a problem with 

23

hypotheticals because I don't know that that particular 

24

case has arisen.  I would think that would be actually a 

25

close question under the Act, because you do have this

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

notion under the PortaltoPortal Act that preliminary 

2

activities and postliminary activities are 

3

noncompensable.  And that, if you go back to Mt. 

4

Clemens, which used the term "preliminary," that 

5

included the sort of wind up process and might well 

6

include this sort of wind down process at the work 

7

station. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Couldn't you say that 

closing down the cash register is part of the job? 

10

 MR. CLEMENT: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You could. 
But getting yourself 

12

inspected as you leave  as you leave the place of 

13

business is not part of the job.  The other case where 

14

it's just part of the job. 

15
16
17
18
19

 MR. CLEMENT: 

You could definitely say that, 

Justice Scalia, and I meant to get that 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You could not only say it; 

it seems to me true. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, all the better, then, to 

20

say it, which is that this then becomes an easier case 

21

than that because it is part of the egress process, 

22

which is really the process of getting from your 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But part of Justice 

24

Kagan's hypothetical was that the 20 minutes or the 30 

25

minutes is just for antitheft purposes.  Or at least I'll

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpret her hypothetical that way.  Just for antitheft 

2

purposes.  Otherwise the cashiers  the records and so 

3

forth are turned up. 

4

 But just for antitheft protection, you need 

5

the 20 or 30 minutes.  If I can interpret the 

6

hypothetical that way, then it seems to me to be the 

7

same. 

8
9

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I don't think it's the same. 

I think it's an arguable case under the Act that it 

10

still might be postliminary, but I think if you look at 

11

the cases that are out there, the courts have struggled 

12

a bit with the preliminary and postliminary activities 

13

that take place at the work station. 

14

 Where I don't think they've struggled until 

15

the Ninth Circuit decision here is when you're talking 

16

about time after you've left the primary work station 

17

and when you're in the process of going to the doors. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That would seem to make it 

19

depend on a complete fortuity.  You know, if I  if I 

20

have the cashier walk from the  the  with her tray 

21

to the manager's station and do the same thing there on 

22

the way out the door, there would be one answer, and if 

23

she does it at the cashier's station, it would be 

24

another answer.  And that seems not particularly 

25

sensible.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, there are some not 

2

particularly sensible results under the PortaltoPortal 

3

Act because things do turn on where activities take 

4

place visàvis walking time.  But I do think what makes 

5

this an easier case than your hypothetical is the exit 

6

screenings are a logical part of the egress process. 

7

The other side in this case tries to raise the specter 

8

of lawn mowing being uncompensated and car washing being 

9

uncompensated, but no employer requires to you take a 

10
11

couple of swipes at a car on your way out the door. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Clement, is it  is 

12

it irrelevant that we're told here that because there 

13

are not enough security checkers and because all the 

14

shifts get out at the same time, what could be a 

15

fiveminute process turns out to be 25 minutes, 25 

16

minutes of the workers' time, and 20 of those allegedly 

17

would not occur if the employer had  provided 

18

sufficient staffing. 

19

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Justice Ginsburg, ultimately, 

20

we don't think that allegation is relevant here.  Now, 

21

it is just an allegation.  But the reason that I say 

22

that it's not relevant here is twofold.  One, the one 

23

thing we know from the PortaltoPortal Act and the 

24

prePortaltoPortal Act cases is the pure length of 

25

time of something does not take it out of preliminary or

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

postliminary activities. 
 If you go back to the Jewell Ridge case and 

3

look at Justice Jackson's dissent, he makes crystal 

4

clear that the travel time at issue there was over an 

5

hour total, and nonetheless the clear import of 

6

PortaltoPortal Act is to treat that hour as 

7

noncompensable time. 

8
9

 The second reason why I think this waiting 
time at the exit would be particularly a bad candidate 

10

for treating as compensable just because it was 

11

relatively long is because it's not uniform 25 minutes. 

12

And so it's directly analogous to the time that was 

13

people had to wait to go in and punch the clock at the 

14

pottery factory in Mt. Clemens. 

15

 And even the Mt. Clemens Court didn't treat 

16

the waiting time to punch in as compensable.  And I 

17

think part of the reason was that it didn't really make 

18

any sense.  It took eight minutes for everybody to get 

19

through, but that would create all sorts of anomalies 

20

where the first person who got through would get 

21

treated  would get paid for eight more minutes than 

22

the last person that got through. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that's true  I'm 

24

sorry.  That's true of a workday generally.  Some people 

25

have to close down the shop; others don't.  So it takes

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the people who are closing down the shop longer.  I'm 

2

not worried about 

3

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Could I stop you there, 

4

though?  I think that's not really true of the 

5

compensable principal time of the workday after the 

6

PortaltoPortal Act, which is whistle to whistle. 

7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yeah, but could we 

start  could we start with that question? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Sure. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What's a principal 

11

activity?  How is it defined?  Because pre or 

12

postactivity to a principal activity, you still have to 

13

define what a principal activity is.  And  and so I 

14

think, isn't a principal activity work that benefits the 

15

employer in some way? 

16

 MR. CLEMENT: 

No, Justice Sotomayor.  And I 

17

think it's important to get two concepts separate.  One 

18

is work under the Fair Labor Standards Act.  And for 

19

purposes of that, all you really do need is things that 

20

are required by the employer for the employer's benefit 

21

that require a minimum amount of exertion.  That's the 

22

test from this Court's cases. 

23

 But principal activities is a separate and 

24

more demanding test under the PortaltoPortal Act.  And 

25

the way I'd think about the statute is the Fair Labor

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Standards Act makes all work presumptively compensable. 

2

And then only when you get to something that is arguably 

3

postliminary or preliminary do you have to ask a 

4

question that involves principal activities.  Because if 

5

you have compensable work and it's not even arguably 

6

preliminary or postliminary, it's compensable without 

7

regard to the PortaltoPortal Act. 

8
9

 But when you get to the PortaltoPortal 
Act, then you have to look, is this a preliminary and 

10

postliminary activity.  And if it is, then it's 

11

presumptively noncompensable unless it's integral and 

12

indispensable to a principal activity. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, let's  let's take 

14

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.  Let's  let's assume 

15

that it takes 25 minutes to check out and that it would 

16

be very easy for the employer to hire a few more 

17

checkers and make it 5 minutes.  Just assume that that's 

18

the fact. 

19

 Why isn't the long line in  caused by very 

20

few checkers for the benefit of the employer?  It's for 

21

the benefit of the employer to hire fewer checkers. 

22

 MR. CLEMENT: 

It might be for the benefit of 

23

the employer in that set of circumstances, Justice 

24

Kennedy, but that doesn't make it not postliminary 

25

activity and not compensable.  And if you look at the

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

universe of all noncompensable time under the 

2

PortaltoPortal Act, I think in every instance you 

3

could say if the employer only did more, he could 

4

reduce  he or she, it could reduce that time. 

5

 And so, if you go back 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

He could move his plant, 

7

for example, to be closer to the city where the 

8

employees live, right?  So it takes him an hour to get 

9

to work.  It's his fault that it  that it takes them 

10

an hour instead of just 10 minutes.  He should move his 

11

plant.  It's just a matter of cost, right? 

12

 MR. CLEMENT: 

That's exactly right, Justice 

13

Scalia.  And you can ticket from the commuting time to 

14

the commuting time internally if you go back to those 

15

trams in the  in the coal mining cases.  If the 

16

employer added more trams or more tram drivers, 

17

presumably, that travel time would be reduced. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is it  is it always 

19

irrelevant to the analysis that it's for or not for the 

20

benefit of the employer? 

21

 MR. CLEMENT: 

It is irrelevant for the 

22

PortaltoPortal Act analysis.  And as I said, it's not 

23

irrelevant to the analysis at all because the fact that 

24

it is for the employer's benefit is part of what makes 

25

it compensable work presumptively or work under the Fair

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Labor Standards Act. 
 But when you get to applying the 

3

PortaltoPortal Act, that is activity that even though 

4

it's work, even though it's required by the employer, 

5

and even though it's for the benefit of the employer, is 

6

nonetheless noncompensable by the terms of the 

7

PortaltoPortal Act.  And if I could just continue 

8

the 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  That's 

10

that's not quite right, because if the employer requires 

11

you to put on a particular outfit that you can't do the 

12

work without, we've said that's compensable. 

13
14
15

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I don't think you have a 

case 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So  and  but donning 

16

generally isn't, so I'm not sure quite how you can take 

17

out that element from this analysis. 

18

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Justice Sotomayor, I don't 

19

think there's a case of this Court that says just 

20

because the employer requires something that would 

21

otherwise be superfluous that it therefore becomes 

22

integral and indispensable.  And so I would actually 

23

take 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I agree with you.  It 

can't be superfluous.  It can't be something that's 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for the benefit of the employee.  Putting on clothes to 

2

keep yourself from being splattered with a nonharmful 

3

substance is for the benefit of the employee.  But 

4

 MR. CLEMENT: 

But  but take something 

5

where a particular employer has an idiosyncratic view 

6

and actually wants their employers  employees to have 

7

a certain color smock or a certain piece of equipment 

8

that's not actually particularly integral and 

9

indispensable to anything. 

10

 I don't think anything in this Court's cases 

11

would say just because the employer required it, it is 

12

therefore compensable. 

13

 And I think if you go back to the 

14

quintessential example of something that is postliminary 

15

and noncompensable, the time clocks, the checking out 

16

process, all of that is required by the employer and for 

17

the employer's benefit. 

18

 And so I don't think you can meaningfully 

19

distinguish the exit screening from those 

20

quintessentially postliminary noncompensable things. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Where did that come from? 

22

Indispensable.  Indispensable.  Hardly anything is 

23

indispensable.  Where  where does that word come from? 

24
25

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, the word comes from this 

Court's decision in Steiner and it come  comes

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

from the Labor Department's 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The Labor Department 

3

says  they're here saying it's the correct test, which 

4

I think is  well, perhaps more important, is there a 

5

close and direct relationship?  Which I understand a 

6

little bit better.  Isn't that labor? 

7
8
9
10
11
12

 MR. CLEMENT: 

That's their gloss on what 

integral and indispensable means. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Oh, I see.  Okay. 
And what I  what I would 

say 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I mean, it can't 

13

literally mean indispensable, can it?  Because then 

14

anything at the end of the day, they're probably five 

15

ways of doing it.  The cash registers, you can do it 

16

this way.  You can do it that way.  I mean 

17

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I  with all due 

18

respect, Justice Breyer, I do think that the test 

19

should be indispensable.  And I do think there are 

20

plenty of things 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If I can think of a way at 

22

the end of the day that the employer could have done it 

23

by saving a little more time or something like that, 

24

then it's postliminary. 

25

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, if it's otherwise

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

postliminary, it doesn't come outside of that exception 

2

and become a principal activity.  And I think two points 

3

to make here.  One is, you know, I think the knife 

4

sharpening in King Packing, for example, really is 

5

indispensable.  You can't run a butchering operation 

6

without sharp knives. 

7

 I think you can perfectly well run a 

8

warehouse facility without egress security.  So I think 

9

these are different. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Actually, Amazon, I don't 

11

think you can.  I mean, what makes Amazon, Amazon?  It's 

12

a system of inventory control that betters everybody else 

13

in the business.  And what's really important to Amazon 

14

is that it knows where every toothbrush in the warehouse 

15

is.  And that's just as integral to what Amazon does and 

16

to what it requires its employees to do as, for example, 

17

the  I'm going back to my hypos  but the person who 

18

closes out the cash register, the person who closes out 

19

the bank teller operation, is that this is sort of a 

20

necessary part of what  of what the  the folks who 

21

do all the stocking and the unshelving and shelving do 

22

at Amazon. 

23

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I guess I would beg to 

24

differ, Justice Kagan.  I think, certainly, everything 

25

in the Amazon facility is barcoded and the like, and

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

everybody knows where everything is, but there's always 

2

the possibility that somebody would not barcode an 

3

incoming item at all and put it in their pocket. 

4

 Now, if they're doing that, they're not 

5

discharging their principal activities, and if they're 

6

detected on the way out, I mean, that might help keep 

7

the next person on mission, but that doesn't make it 

8

integral and indispensable to discharging the primary 

9

job duty. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I suppose that it is also 

11

necessary to Amazon's business that it know how many 

12

hours each of its workers has worked, so it knows how 

13

much to pay them and doesn't pay them more, right? 

14

And  and yet, there's no doubt whatever, is there, 

15

that punching in and punching out is not  is  is 

16

preliminary and postliminary, right? 

17

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I hope there's no doubt about 

18

that, Justice Scalia.  And I do think that the exit 

19

security screenings are just the modern  modern 

20

analogue of that.  Not only do they both come at the 

21

employer's insistence and for the employer's benefit, 

22

but they also have this process of verifying that the 

23

employers are essentially behaving in an honest and 

24

and  way. 

25

 It's the same way as trying to ensure that an

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employee is not lying about having worked an eighthour 

2

day.  You use the time clocks to verify that.  You also 

3

use the exit screening for that process.  And the other 

4

aspect of it that makes it so closely analogous is they 

5

are a logical part of the egress process.  They are part 

6

of getting you from your principal work station to the 

7

exit doors at the end of the day, classically 

8

postliminary activity. 

9

 If that's not  if the Court is to treat 

10

that as compensable, then it's not clear what's left of 

11

the PortaltoPortal Act.  The PortaltoPortal Act was 

12

Congress's judgment that these kind of preliminary and 

13

postliminary activities should not be compensable. 

14

 It would be perfectly rational to have a 

15

system where you compensated employees from portal to 

16

portal, and that's basically the regime that this Court 

17

created in a series of cases culminating in Mt. Clemens 

18

Pottery.  But it's just as clear that Congress reversed 

19

that result in PortaltoPortal Act. 

20

 If I could reserve the balance of my time.

the employer's premises at the entrance to the portal and 

7

get to the place where they perform their principal work 

8

activities at the beginning of the day, and then the 

9

process by which they leave at the end of the day and 

10
11

get to the exits. 
 We think that security screenings here are 

12

noncompensable because they are postliminary activities, 

13

and they are not integral and indispensable to the 

14

employees' principal work activities. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You said in your brief 

16

that there are some security searches that would be 

17

compensable.  So would you tell us which ones are and 

18

which ones aren't? 

19
20

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think you're referring 

to footnote 18 of our brief, Justice Ginsburg. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

22

 MR. GANNON: 

Yes. 
And there we talk about the 

23

fact that the employer can't just require lots of other 

24

things to be done at the end of the day and call those 

25

things postliminary.  I don't think that we have any

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particular examples of searches in mind.  There aren't 

2

cases that deal with compensable searches.  But I think 

3

the question there would be whether the activity has so 

4

fundamentally changed the nature of what's going on that 

5

it no longer resembles the ordinary process of checking 

6

out.  The reason why we think 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You can't think of an 

8

example, then, where a security check, an exit security 

9

check, would be compensable? 

10

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think it would probably 

11

have to be a type of search that is so dramatically 

12

different, more intrusive, more timeconsuming, the 

13

search itself, not just the time waiting in line, that 

14

it's fundamentally transformed the nature of the 

15

activity.  So I think to the extent that some of the 

16

examples that are suggested in the briefs, like drug 

17

testing, you could analogize that in some way to an 

18

antitheft search.  One of the hypotheticals has to do 

19

with a person who works in a pharmaceutical 

20

manufacturing facility, have they taken the 

21

pharmaceuticals.  The employer may want to test them on 

22

the way out. 

23

 And I'd say that drug testing is not the 

24

type of thing that is normally associated with entering 

25

and leaving the property.  It's not the ordinary course

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of checking in and checking out, waiting in line to do 

2

so, the types of things that the Labor Department was 

3

thinking about in 1947 when it adopted the interpretive 

4

regulation that gave those examples. 

5

 And I also think that drug testing is not 

6

the sort of thing that's classically associated with the 

7

entrances and the exits.  It's the sort of thing that is 

8

usually done somewhere else.  And that's different from 

9

security and safety screenings, the most of which I 

10

understand Respondents concede are not actually going to 

11

be compensable. 

12

 And so we think that those are the two 

13

reasons why in this case this looks like something that 

14

is both postliminary  it happens as part of a process 

15

of getting out, it is  it happens at the door, at the 

16

portal or near there  and it is not integral and 

17

indispensable.  It is different from the activities that 

18

were at issue in Steiner or in King Packing or in IBP, 

19

because the employees when they are on the work floor 

20

doing their job, surely they do have access to 

21

merchandise.  It is of course important to Amazon, as 

22

you pointed out, Justice Kagan, that they not take the 

23

merchandise.  Amazon and Integrity Staffing want to know 

24

where the merchandise is. 

25

 But the idea that this benefits the employer

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or is required by the employer isn't enough to make it 

2

compensable because, as Mr. Clement was just saying, 

3

that's the test for whether something was work.  That's 

4

what was the test under Mt. Clemens, and Congress 

5

excepted from that a class of activities, preliminary 

6

and postliminary activities, that are noncompensable. 

7

Travel time and preliminary and postliminary activities 

8

like time clocks, punching in and punching out, that's 

9

required by the employer.  It benefits the employer. 

10
11

That's not enough to make it compensable. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But is the idea, then, 

12

Mr. Gannon, just  you know, it's basically a door 

13

test?  I mean, portal to portal.  It might make sense 

14

just to have a door test, exits and entrances. 

15

 MR. GANNON: 

I think that it has  to be 

16

more precise about it, I think that canonically most of 

17

the activities are going to be associated with the 

18

process of getting in and out.  Those were the  those 

19

were the things that were at issue in the 

20

PortaltoPortal Act cases that Congress was effectively 

21

reversing when it adopted the PortaltoPortal Act.  And 

22

I think it's the continuous workday rule that's going to 

23

make it it makes sure that it happens only at the 

24

beginning and the end of the day.  I think that, to be 

25

more precise about it, though, the way the statute is

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

phrased, it talks about these being activities that 

2

occur before the principal work activities begin at the 

3

end of the day or after they cease.  Something isn't 

4

preliminary if you've already started doing your 

5

principal activities and it's not postliminary if you 

6

haven't already ceased them. 

7

 And so the question is whether this is itself a 

8

principal activity by virtue of being integral and 

9

indispensable and 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Can we write this case 

11

without discussing whether or not this is for the 

12

benefit of the employer?  Or do we have to address that? 

13

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think that it's always 

14

going to be for the benefit of the employer if it comes 

15

up in the context of the PortaltoPortal Act, because 

16

we wouldn't be concerned about whether the exception 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you're saying that that is 

really not at all helpful or necessary for the analysis? 
 MR. GANNON: 

I don't think it is, because 

20

that's the antecedent question about whether it would 

21

have been compensable under the FLSA.  If it doesn't 

22

benefit the employer, if it's not required by the 

23

employer, it wouldn't have been work, you don't need to 

24

decide whether it's preliminary and postliminary and 

25

therefore excepted from the mandatory compensation

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

requirement. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you can  so we assume 

that it's for the benefit of the employer. 
 MR. GANNON: 

Yes.  I think that it almost 

5

certainly is always going to be for the benefit of the 

6

employer, just like time clocks are, just like you could 

7

say the requirement in Tennessee Coal and Jewell Mining, 

8

the mine cases, that employees were required to ride 

9

from the face  from the portal of the mine, down to 

10

the face where they are going to be working, they were 

11

required to ride in the ore skiff  in the ore skip, 

12

and presumably that benefitted the employer for all 

13

sorts of reasons.  They didn't have to make more room 

14

for people to walk.  They didn't have to worry about 

15

employees getting injured by skips that were going by. 

16

And that's not enough to ensure 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I give you a different 

18

hypo, which is similar to some of the ones that have 

19

been floating around in the brief, but it's actually based 

20

on real life circumstances.  There was a judge ages ago 

21

in the Southern District of New York who had his clerks 

22

 all that they did was help him with his opinions and 

23

his cases and that was their principal activity, but had 

24

his clerks come early in order to cut his grapefruit and 

25

otherwise make breakfast for him.  And would that be

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

compensable? 
 MR. GANNON: 

Well, setting aside the 

3

question of whether the law clerks were covered by the 

4

FLSA to begin with 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

6
7

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 

yeah. 
 MR. GANNON: 

 I take the point that that 

8

would be compensable, and I think there we're talking 

9

about a kind of activity that isn't preliminary or 

10

postliminary.  We do think that those words have 

11

independent meaning.  As we discuss in our brief 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The one question I have for 

13

your side is this.  I would  perhaps no one else 

14

would, but I a pay a lot of attention to the Labor 

15

Department. 

16

 MR. GANNON: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 But this is a dismissal of a complaint and 

So do we, Justice Breyer. 
Yes, I understand that. 

19

it seems to me normally what happens is you debate these 

20

facts on the summary judgment.  I don't know if they 

21

want to introduce something else.  I mean, in my own 

22

mind, I can think of five things I'd like to know about 

23

the activity and about other activities and, you know, 

24

is it more like the cash register, is it more like this 

25

or that.  So shouldn't we send it back so that if they 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

want to develop the record further, they can? 
 MR. GANNON: 

I think, as the facts are 

3

alleged here, we know enough to know that these 

4

activities are not 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No matter what?  I mean, 

6

suppose it turns out that the warehouse thing  you 

7

look all over the country and this kind of warehouse 

8

employee, of course they have security checks and they 

9

have a special kind of security checks, other people 

10

don't have them.  This is just normal that a warehouse 

11

employee does have a security check at the end of the 

12

day, and, boy, it begins to look a little bit more 

13

integral.  It begins to look like part of the job, just 

14

as he has to put the books back on the shelf.  He has to 

15

put the books back on the shelf and he has to get a 

16

security check. 

17

 MR. GANNON: 

Putting books back on the 

18

shelf, closing out the cash register, taking the cash 

19

car to the supervisor, all of those things we think are 

20

compensable.  Those are not 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Then what's different about 

22

this?  What you do is you put it back on the shelf, you 

23

go get your security checked, and there we are. 

24
25

 MR. GANNON: 

Because those are still the 

activities that the employee is paying you to perform,

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and so that is the job that you are doing.  You're still 

2

handling the money, you're still 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I just don't 

4

understand that, Mr. Gannon, because, as Justice Kennedy 

5

said, the point of my hypo was that it's not part of the 

6

job.  It's actually an antitheft mechanism. 

7

 MR. GANNON: 

But it's part of the job 

8

because it's things that have to be done in order to 

9

I mean, the employer has set up the procedure in order 

10

to manage the cash.  The cash has to be taken somewhere 

11

at the end of the day.  When you're doing all of that 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

The cash could be taken 

13

somewhere much more quickly and much more easily if the 

14

employer were not worried about the employee pocketing 

15

some of it, you know.  I mean, you could just put it in 

16

a big bag, versus going through this very, very careful 

17

sort of inventory control. 

18

 MR. GANNON: 

I don't think the purpose is 

19

enough to distinguish.  And we discuss at the end of our 

20

brief about how there are safety and security searches, 

21

that the purposes overlap a lot here, whether the 

22

employer is trying to protect its time when it requires 

23

somebody to do punching in or punching out or to protect 

24

its property.  I think the purpose is very difficult to 

25

make that the distinguishing factor.

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But there we think that those activities are 

2

still what the employer is paying you to do.  They're 

3

not  when you're done with the cash drawer, when 

4

you've turned in the cash and then you're done, you've 

5

ceased your principal activities for the day, now you 

6

need to walk out the door.  And if at the door, they 

7

want to look in your purse, we think that that doesn't 

8

transform the time it took you from being done with your 

9

job to getting off the property into being compensable 

10

any more than it would with the donning and doffing 

11

cases. 

12

 Once you had finished taking off the garb, 

13

you were done, and then if you still had to walk you 

14

weren't getting paid.  In IBP, this Court held that when 

15

you were waiting in line to put on the equipment in the 

16

morning, if the employer decides that they're just a 

17

Nervous Nellie and they want you to be wearing all sort 

18

of extra security equipment that nobody really thinks is 

19

important but the employer demands that you do, and they 

20

think it benefits them, then you're going to have to get 

21

paid for the time it takes to put that on, but not the 

22

time you are waiting in line to do so.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. THIERMAN

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 We agree that there are levels of analysis 

5

and the first level is, is this work; and under 785.7 of 

6

the regs this is work because it's an activity required 

7

for the benefit of the employer.  Having said it's work, 

8

the question then becomes, is it a principal activity. 

9

Not whether it is integral and indispensable, but is it 

10

a principal activity, because we never get to integral 

11

and indispensable, we never get to postliminary and 

12

preliminary, if it is a standalone or a principal 

13

activity.  And to answer that question 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Just  before you get to 

15

that, to understand the structure of your argument, if 

16

we were to disagree with you on the question of whether 

17

it's a principal activity that means you would lose this 

18

case?  You haven't argued that this is integral and 

19

indispensable, have you? 

20

 MR. THIERMAN: 

The Ninth Circuit has taken 

21

the position it's integral and indispensable.  We have 

22

not argued that.  We have argued that the Ninth Circuit 

23

test  there are two tests.  There's 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Have you abandoned that 

argument?

28

Alderson Reporting Company

5

 MR. THIERMAN: 

No, I think we've basically 

put the argument in a different place. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Where in your brief do I 

find your argument on integral and indispensable? 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

We adopt the same test as the 

6

Ninth Circuit.  We just say that it proves principal 

7

activity.  We don't say it proves integral and 

8

indispensable.  So we have the same test 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So a principal activity is 

10

something that's integral and indispensable and then a 

11

postliminary activity could be compensable if it's also 

12

integral and indispensable? 

13

 MR. THIERMAN: 

No.  A principal activity is 

14

something that the employer tells to you do for the 

15

benefit of the employer that's not carved out by one of 

16

the exceptions, the exceptions being travel under 

17

254(a)1, checking in and checking out and 

18
19
20
21
22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Cutting grapefruit for the 

judge would be a separate principal activity. 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

It would, because the judge 

told to you do it. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes, but this is 

23

no one's principal activity is going through security 

24

screening.  The employer doesn't hire somebody, I need 

25

somebody to go through employee screening.  He hires

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

them to do something else and then the employee 

2

screening is certainly not principal. 

3

 MR. THIERMAN: 

But no one hired the clerks 

4

of this Court to wear morning jackets, yet it is a 

5

requirement of the job.  Would they be  are they 

6

required to do it?  Yes.  If they are required to do it 

7

on site, that is you require the changing on site by the 

8

regulations, it must be compensable.  You could have 

9

waiters wear uniforms if you required 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think you hire them to 

11

wear proper attire.  Of course, you do.  You could hire 

12

a policeman to wear police uniforms 

13

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Then you hire warehousemen 

14

not to steal merchandise. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, that's not part of 

16

their job as a warehouseman.  That isn't what they are 

17

hired for.  Policemen are hired to look like policemen 

18

and act like policemen.  And people who argue for the 

19

Solicitor General are hired to speak like lawyers and 

20

dress like members of the SG's office.  I think that's 

21

the difference between a principal activity and 

22

something that's postliminary or preliminary. 

23

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Well, it depends on the view 

24

you take of their job, if you look at the tasks they are 

25

performing or do you look at their overall function.

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Their overall function is to move merchandise without 

2

losing it.  If they don't  if they ship it to the wrong 

3

address, if they drop it in the wrong bin then it can't 

4

be received, it's not there the next day they look for 

5

that particular item in that particular bin, then they 

6

haven't done their job.  And if they steal, it's the 

7

same thing. 

8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well then, I guess I 

don't understand what "principal" means.  You're saying 

10

everything that is related somehow to the job is 

11

principal.  I would have thought principal has to do 

12

with things that are more significantly related. 

13

 You would say, typically, if somebody asked 

14

what do you do, if you were one of these people, you 

15

would say, oh, I fill orders for Amazon.  I mean, it may 

16

be part of that that you go through security at the end 

17

of the day, but that doesn't make it a principal 

18

activity. 

19

 MR. THIERMAN: 

The term "principal" doesn't 

20

mean that it's overwhelmingly important.  It means it's 

21

one of your job tasks.  And just like making the 

22

grapefruit 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Then I don't know 

24

why don't you say "activities" rather than "principal 

25

activities"?

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 MR. THIERMAN: 

The statute uses the word 

"principal activity." 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know you say it 

4

because you want to fit under the statute, but I'm 

5

saying I don't understand.  It seems to me you're just 

6

saying anything that is required for the benefit of the 

7

employer is a principal activity. 

8
9

 MR. THIERMAN: 

We are saying that anything 

that is required  a person is hired to do what they 

10

are told to do.  That's your job.  It's not whether it 

11

exists in some kind of abstract job function or abstract 

12

flow chart.  The worker isn't sitting there deciding, 

13

well, gee, is this a principal activity? 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The workers are 

15

told:   You've got to check out.  It's something they 

16

are told that they have to do. 

17

 MR. THEIRMAN: 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19
20

That's right. 
And under your 

theory that would be a principal activity. 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

No.  Workers are told they 

21

have to return their tools, which they have to be paid 

22

for; they have to punch out or check out; and then after 

23

that, and 20 minutes after that, they have to be 

24

searched.  So the idea that this is just a part of 

25

checking out is wrong, factually, in this case.

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 It is also wrong that when you  for 

2

example, roll calls.  Roll calls for  are a checking 

3

in function, but yet because there's more to it than 

4

just checking in it's compensable, whereas just saying, 

5

hi, I'm here, is not compensable. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Just as the employer does 

7

not hire somebody to check in, that's not the job.  I 

8

want to employ you to check in?  Of course not. 

9

 So also, an employer does not hire somebody 

10

in order to be inspected when he leaves.  I don't see 

11

how you can call it a principal activity. 

12

 MR. THIERMAN: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If the employer 
And it's not indispensable 

14

to the taking care of the material in the warehouse. 

15

It's indispensable to  it's important to the employer 

16

and he requires it just as he requires punching in and 

17

punching out.  But that doesn't make it part of the job. 

18
19
20
21
22

 MR. THIERMAN: 

It's indispensable to keeping 

your job.  If you don't go through the security 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that's true, but so 

is punching in and punching out. 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

And there is this carveout 

23

for checking in and checking out, which we acknowledge. 

24

It is a separate, discrete function and it is a  it is 

25

not a work of consequence, which is actually the second

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

part of the definition under 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But the other way to look at 

3

this is that the reason why checking in and checking out 

4

is not compensable is because it does have to do with 

5

this going in and going out.  You know, it's all about 

6

ingress and egress, and that's what the PortaltoPortal 

7

Act was about.  And if I make you go through a security 

8

gate as part of getting out of a factory, then it just 

9

becomes part of this  the principal design of the 

10

PortaltoPortal Act was about going in and going out 

11

and this is part of that. 

12

 MR. THIERMAN: 

But I can't have an assembly 

13

line where you start at one end and at the end of the 

14

assembly line, you're done for the day and say 

15

everything along the way since it leads to your exit is 

16

going to be a part of the egress process. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What you have here which 

18

you could address in this is  he's quite right, 

19

Mr. Clement.  Steiner uses the words three or four 

20

times, the integral and indispensable, but they qualify 

21

activities that take place outside of regular work 

22

hours.  I think here it's conceded that it takes place 

23

outside regular work hours, it's indeed after checkout, 

24

etcetera.  So the question becomes integral and 

25

indispensable and they have gloss on that and so forth.

Okay. 
 So I'm in the situation probably I'd say go 

3

with the Labor Department.  They are the ones who are in 

4

charge of this.  And they are saying you lose.  They 

5

point to something in 1951.  And I have two questions. 

6

The first one is, is there anything else you want to put 

7

in besides this very detailed complaint?  And the second 

8

question is, okay, why don't you lose?  What am I 

9

supposed to do with that opinion?  It's sitting there 

10
11
12

 MR. THIERMAN: 

It's not reasoned.  It 

doesn't 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, that's true, but it's 

13

never seen in ad law in this area that  okay, you can 

14

cite Skidmore et cetera.  But 

15

 MR. THIERMAN: 

They don't even rely on it. 

16

It's not an interpretation of the regulations.  I think 

17

what happened is is the bundle 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But they are telling us 

now. 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

They are telling us now, but 

21

I think it's bundled.  The question is, do we bundle 

22

this process or do we unbundle it.  We say, just like 

23

the cashier  by the way, we represent a lot of 

24

employees who sue casinos for the fact that they punch 

25

out, go downstairs, count their bank and then tally up,

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

takes 15 to 20 minutes, and then they go out a 

2

special door for casino employees, and is all that 

3

egress or is that a separate act? 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, the answer to the 

5

first question, which was yes or no, there isn't 

6

anything else you want to put in the record.  You are 

7

perfectly content with our deciding this on the facts 

8

that are in the complaint? 

9

 MR. THIERMAN: 

I would put in the record 

10

just what I just told Justice Kagan.  That is, 

11

this is a discrete act.  This is not a wait  they 

12

punch out first.  They don't punch out at the end.  They 

13

don't punch out during.  They punch out  the checking 

14

in and checking out function is completely finished. 

15

They hand in their tools.  They hand in, which they're 

16

paid for because that the Department of Labor says you 

17

have to be paid for, and the regulations don't  none 

18

of the briefs talk about the 7  the 785 series of 

19

regulations which define work.  And the 785 series 

20

define work as basically when you're under the control 

21

and doing what the employer tells to you do.  And there 

22

are 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And how do you explain 

24

that you're not compensated for the time you are on the 

25

line waiting to don your protective gear?  Protective

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

gear, donning it itself, that's a required part of the 

2

job, and you're compensated for that.  But you're not 

3

compensated for the wait to do that. 

4

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Because it's a way in versus 

5

a way out.  You're leaving.  So the continuous workday 

6

works in favor of the employee in this time.  The 

7

continuous workday starts at the donning part, it ends 

8

at the doffing part.  And in the Steiner case and 

9

Alvarez the doffing, the wait to doff, was covered 

10

because it was part of the continuous work day.  It 

11

it  so it's the mirror image of when coming in.  We're 

12

not saying they should get paid for waiting on line to 

13

come in.  We're saying they should get paid waiting on 

14

line to be searched.  They are already checked out. 

15

It's to be searched, and drug testing is compensable. 

16

When they send to you a physical to get drug tested or a 

17

physical to do a job, that's compensable time. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

All of this is 

19

subject to collective bargaining.  In other words, 

20

you're sitting down and you say we want it to be $15 an 

21

hour and you're asking for a dollar raise and you'll 

22

say, look, one reason we should get it is because we 

23

have to wait a half hour to get out or whatever, and 

24

that's  whether it's compensable time or not, that can 

25

certainly be a factor that goes into the collective

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bargaining. 

2

 MR. THIERMAN: 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well 
This only comes out 

4

because it's after the fact.  And after it's all taken 

5

place, you go back and say we should get  what are 

6

these, double damages or 

7
8
9

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Liquidated damages are 

discretionary, it's 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But going forward, 

10

they can always say, oh, we're not going  the court 

11

says we're not going to get compensated for this time so 

12

we're going to insist on a higher amount of the hourly 

13

wage for the 8 hours that we do get compensated for. 

14

 MR. THIERMAN: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

16
17
18
19
20
21

Well 
Are these employees 

unionized? 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

These are nonunion 

employees.  They are all nonunion employees. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, a lot of the 

employees covered by this are union employees, right? 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

Actually, the  the 

22

Petitioner makes a big deal about this avalanche of 

23

things happening, but so far out of the 7,000 or so FLSA 

24

work  lawsuits that are filed every  every year, 

25

there are only five or six defendants who have ever been

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

hit with this in the last ten years.  And no, they are 

2

mostly nonunion companies. 

3

 You are talking about 3.0, and the clothes 

4

changing is a separate exception.  But in fact, the reg 

5

on that says if it was required by law or the employer 

6

and it's not covered by the union contract, then it is 

7

compensable.  So it is the requirement that the employer 

8

tell you to do it that, I think is the linchpin to make 

9

something a principal activity. 

10

 If the employer didn't have a mandate, if 

11

the employer says to Justice Scalia, well, I don't 

12

really care how you get here but you better show up at 

13

8 o'clock, you can get here at 7:30, you can get here at 

14

7:45.  You take the risk you're going to be late.  That's 

15

a different story.  That's a different standard.  That's 

16

the integral and indispensable. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What if the employer says I 

18

have to take a particular employerowned trolley to get 

19

to the place where I work? 

20

 MR. THIERMAN: 

It's covered by a specific 

21

exception under the 254(a)(1).  It's the travel. 

22

Mt. Clemens was the furthest extension of work we have. 

23

They rolled back Mt. Clemens.  They rolled back a part 

24

of Tennessee Coal, which was the travel time, but when 

25

they rolled back Mt. Clemens, they only rolled back a

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

portion of it.  They rolled back the going from the 

2

portal to your work station part of it.  They didn't 

3

roll back everything that was in Mt. Clemens. 

4

 Even though it's in the briefs, I'm sure the 

5

Petitioner would not want to the de minimus rule to be 

6

eviscerated.  It is a rule for their favor.  That's in 

7

Mt. Clemens.  There's lots of stuff in Mt. Clemens that 

8

still survives on both sides.  But Mt. Clemens rolled 

9

back  was rolled back by the PortaltoPortal Act by 

10

the concept of you're on the property, you're in the 

11

employ.  I mean, where  Nevada has one of the  is 

12

actually has that kind of sense of employment as opposed 

13

to the Federal employment, which is a much more 

14

employee  employer directed.  You do what you're told. 

15

Your day starts when your first command comes down. 

16

 Here's  the last command is to be 

17

searched.  And it doesn't take 2 minutes; it takes 

18

20 minutes, because they don't want to open up more 

19

kiosks and  and  or use some kind of queueing theory 

20

and shorten the lines.  That's their choice. 

21

 It's also a way of enforcing a  a policy 

22

or a way of  there are other ways to make sure people 

23

don't steal things.  They could use cameras.  They could 

24

use  they could use a tally.  They could make people 

25

stand by their bench at the end of the day and they go

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

through every bin.  Certainly that would be compensable. 
 It's  the fact is they chose this method. 

3

It's an employer's choice to do it, because it's the 

4

cheapest method to do it, to discourage employee theft. 

5

And if the merchandise isn't there at the  at the 

6

end of the day or the beginning of the next shift, you 

7

can't do your job.  So in that sense, it is 

8

indispensable.  You need that merchandise not to be 

9

stolen so you can fill your orders. 

10

 But just the command itself, unless it's a 

11

carveout, which we have a carveout for changing  for 

12

checking in, checking out.  We have a carveout for 

13

travel, communitytype travel.  It's work because you're 

14

told to do it and it's not an employee's position to 

15

say, gee, I don't think this is work or I don't think 

16

this is compensable.  They used the example of sneaking 

17

out the back door.  We don't want employees to be going, 

18

oh, well, I'm not getting paid for this, so I'm going to 

19

sneak out the back door. 

20

 Now, when it's a nonmandated  employer 

21

nonmandated task, then we have a whole set of different 

22

rules.  That's when we use integral and indispensable. 

23

Then we say:  Is it necessary?  Is it indispensable? 

24

Was he doing it for his own convenience or was he doing 

25

it for the employer's because he couldn't do the job

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

without it? 
 If we have a situation where we're  we're 

3

told to do it and he doesn't do it, he's fired, I think 

4

that's  that's ipso facto indispensable to his job, 

5

whether it makes sense or not from the employer's point 

6

of view.  I mean, employers make people do all kinds of 

7

things that don't make sense. 

8
9

 Anyway, the fact is that there are lots of 
examples in the regs of things that are just not  that 

10

are not standalone jobs that are principal activities. 

11

And if the  if the definition of a principal activity 

12

requires it to be related to something else 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think you  I think 

14

you may have misspoke.  There aren't standalone 

15

standalone jobs that are not principal activities. 

16

 MR. THIERMAN: 

I'm sorry.  I did it 

17

backwards.  There are jobs that are not standalone, that 

18

are portions of the day that are principal activities. 

19

The grapefruit would be one.  You don't make grapefruit 

20

all day long for the judge.  There are  so the concept 

21

that it has to be a job in and of itself that you can 

22

have somebody else to do it is wrong. 

23

 The changing clothes, the engage to wait. 

24

If you look in the  if you look in the legislative 

25

history and you look in the regulations, there are two

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

scenarios that Senator Cooper says explains everything. 

2

The first one is waiting  is you've got to come in and 

3

oil your machine before you can do your job.  That's 

4

integral and indispensable.  But the second one is 

5

laying out work for other people.  Now, we don't even 

6

know what that particular person's job is.  For all we 

7

know, they could be the coffee maker or the  or the 

8

gofer or whatever, but they have a task that has been 

9

assigned by their employer that they must be paid for 

10

doing, the laying out the work of other people.  That's 

11

not integral and indispensable to their job.  But it's a 

12

specific task.  It's a principal activity.  And 

13

that's  and that's what I think the legislation 

14

contemplates. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Those are all things that 

16

somebody might pay somebody to do individually.  So if 

17

the  if the law clerk didn't prepare the grapefruit, 

18

the judge might hire somebody else to come in and 

19

prepare the grapefruit.  But this is different, isn't 

20

it?  Because nobody would  you wouldn't pay anybody 

21

just to come in and go through a security 

22

 MR. THIERMAN: 

And nobody would pay anyone 

23

to have their changing into a uniform to be a waiter. 

24

But if you require the changing on site, it's 

25

compensable.  No one 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All I'm saying is that the 

2

examples you gave are  are quite different because 

3

those are like mowing the lawn, things like that, those 

4

are things you would pay somebody.  If you didn't have 

5

this employee do it, you could  you might hire 

6

somebody else to do it. 

7

 MR. THIERMAN: 

The problem is waiting to 

8

receive instructions.  Okay.  That is clearly engaged to 

9

wait; you're waiting to receive instructions.  If you 

10

aren't going to do anything with those instructions, 

11

that's not a job.  You don't say if someone's a 

12

professional instructionreceiving person.  That's not a 

13

job.  Yet it's a principal activity.  You are engaged to 

14

wait.  And it doesn't matter whether you're engaged to 

15

wait because the employer wants you there on the ready 

16

for something to happen or the employer just says, you 

17

know, I feel like having the factory full on Tuesday. 

18

Maybe  whatever the employer wants to do, assuming 

19

it's not illegal 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, I understand that, but 

21

it's  that enables you to do the thing that the 

22

employer is paying you for.  It's different from the 

23

examples that you gave. 

24

 MR. THIERMAN: 

25

It is if you're not  if it 

does, in fact, lead to that.  But there are employers

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

who say  they're OCD, they want everyone there till 

2

8 o'clock, even if you have nothing to do.  I'm paying 

3

you to stay till 8:00 o'clock, you stay till 8:00 

4

o'clock.  There's nothing that is coming out of that, 

5

but yet you are told to stay, so you stay.  And there's 

6

no  there's no function to it.  I mean, the employers 

7

do things like that or they do it for reasons that we 

8

don't know or we won't understand and we don't care 

9

because that's our system.  They are allowed to run 

10

their business their way.  And a corollary of that is 

11

that they tell people what to do.  And, you know, the 

12

old rule in the union shop is obey and grieve.  You 

13

don't like, do it and then grieve it later. 

14

 Same thing here. 

It doesn't make sense 

15

what we're doing, but we're going to do it.  And 

16

that's  and, you know, maybe it's a slow day and he 

17

just wants to make his  the employer wants to keep the 

18

people busy.  Whatever it is, if the employer tells to 

19

you do it and it's not within these carveouts, it  it 

20

is compensable. 

21

 And the drug testing is another example. 

22

The drug testing is compensable.  Why?  Because your 

23

freedom  you're giving up your time.  Your freedom 

24

isn't  and you're doing it because the employer told 

25

told you to do it.

45

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Suppose the employer has 

2

enough stations that it just takes a minute to go 

3

through.  Would you still be making the argument that 

4

that's compensable? 

5

 MR. THIERMAN: 

If the  if the employees go 

6

through in a minute, it's de minimis.  And that's  and 

7

that's the safety valve or the escape valve.  First we 

8

decide if it's work; second we decide if it's within the 

9

postliminary and preliminary carveout; and third we 

10

decide if it's de minimis. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12
13

Gotcha.  Okay.  Five 

minutes? 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

The Ninth Circuit uses a 

14

tenminute rule.  It  it varies.  I mean, it  it 

15

if it's constantly done every day for ten minutes 

16

exactly, it gets close.  But three minutes, it's 

17

trivial. 

18

 But we're not talking trivial here. 

We're 

19

talking 20, 25 minutes.  And it's 20 to 25 minutes not 

20

necessary to be done if they didn't have the screening, 

21

if they didn't have that  that type of screening.  You 

22

know, you take off your clothes, you take off your 

23

shoes, you put your jacket down, you empty your pockets. 

24

And then the metal detector goes off anyway and they 

25

take you aside and they do another screening.  That's

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not de minimis.  That's a whole long process.  If you go 

2

through the airport, we know it. 

3

 The funny thing is, you ask about the  we 

4

do this on the way into an airport.  Nobody screens you 

5

on the way out of an airport.  I don't think the 

6

government very often screens people on the way out of a 

7

building.  It could be an exception, I know.  But  but 

8

generally speaking, people are screened on the way in, 

9

and that's because it's not for the benefit of the 

10

employer, it's for the benefit of the public, for their 

11

security and safety. 

12

 This is not a security check. 

This is not 

13

patting you down for weapons or taking out nuclear 

14

secrets or anything like that.  This is why  this is 

15

only a theft deterrent mechanism.  In fact, one could 

16

argue that the  that the search itself, whether they 

17

find anything or not, has an effect on every other 

18

employee who knows it's happening.  It's a 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What would the rule be 

20

suppose there weren't a special section about clothing. 

21

Suppose that didn't exist and  and suppose you had to 

22

change into a uniform.  Would that be compensable or 

23

not? 

24
25

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Well, the way the  the way 

the history 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

2

 MR. THIERMAN: 

What is the history? 
The way the history is, it 

3

says if it's necessary for the job and then they 

4

distinguish between changing on site and changing off 

5

site.  So we're not talking about protective clothing. 

6

We're talking about decorative clothing.  Okay?  And 

7

the  and the argument is you change once in the 

8

morning when you go to work.  That you do on your own 

9

time.  And if the employer says, I want you to wear a 

10

blue shirt instead of a pink shirt or a yellow shirt, 

11

he's not really adding to your burden.  All he's doing 

12

is selecting your clothes for you. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 MR. THIERMAN: 

But if it's a uniform 
But if it's  even if it's a 

15

uniform, if you could wear it to work  and this 

16

happens with police officers.  If they can wear their 

17

uniform to work and the  and the locker room at work 

18

is just for the convenience of the officers, it's not 

19

compensable.  But if they have to change on site for 

20

whatever reason  in clean rooms they have to change on 

21

site because they need those uniforms to be pressed.  In 

22

one of our cases we have involving a casino, they don't 

23

want their image diluted by seeing uniform outside 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So you're saying if you 

didn't have that special section, this is compensable.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

If it were a change of clothing, it had to take place on 

2

site. 

3

 MR. THIERMAN: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5
6

Exactly. 
And so this isn't really 

different from that. 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

That's right.  It's not 

7

different from that because they're telling you you have 

8

to stay on site. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You have to do it on site 

10

and it's no  it's the same kind of burden that you might 

11

have to have protective clothes or some kind of special 

12

thing that you change into on site. 

13

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Right.  They  the employer 

14

requires it for the employer's convenience and it 

15

doesn't fall in the travel exception.  It's not checking 

16

in and checking out because, as I've said, the checking 

17

in and checking out, first of all, is a very, very minor 

18

task. 

19
20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What's the example that you 

you found that's the closest to this that favors you?

 MR. THIERMAN: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

 MR. THIERMAN: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Drug testing. 
Hmm? 
Drug testing. 
Drug testing. 
Because drug testing you can

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do on the way out or you can do it on the  on the way 

2

in or  and  and if they want to test you on the way 

3

out because they want you to go  I mean, there are 

4

ways of defeating a drug test by taking other chemicals. 

5

So they escort you to the bathroom, they make somebody 

6

sit there and watch you while you  while you  while 

7

you give them a sample and then they go test it, and 

8

they won't let you leave until you're done testing it 

9

until they're done testing it and they have a result. 

10
11
12
13

That's a close example.  And yet 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean, is that well 

established? 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

There's DOL memo of 1997, 

14

September 15, and it says drug testing is compensable. 

15

Physical exams for truck drivers and other types of 

16

people are compensable.  Fueling the truck when you're 

17

done with your trip is compensable. 

18
19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is waiting to put on 

protective gear compensable? 

20

See, we're  we're dealing with a continuous workday 


2


rule and we're on the other end of it.  Most of the 


3


cases everyone is talking about are preliminary to work. 

4

We're talking postliminary if  or principal activity. 

5

And on the way out, it's the continuous workday rule 

6

works in favor of the employee.  On the way in, it works 

7

in favor of the employer because the clock hasn't 

8

started.  Anyway

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All of the examples 

10

you've just been giving and what you say the rules 

11

are 

12

 MR. THIERMAN: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

Yes. 
 are they part of the 

labor regulations? 

15

 MR. THIERMAN: 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Yes.  They're  they're 
So I can find them? 
Yes.  They're in  they're 

18

in the  what the  what the government and Petitioner 

19

don't discuss is the 785 series.  The 785 series is 

20

what's work.  The 785 series says that if you are 

21

required to take a  a seminar, even if it's nothing to 

22

do with what you  what you are employed to do, it's 

23

compensable. 

24
25

 If it's a voluntary seminar, then it  then 
there's a  a kind of a test.  Well, is it related to

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

your work, not related to your work, is it going to 

2

advance your work or not advance it.  But if it's 

3

totally unrelated to your work, but you're required to 

4

take the seminar, whether it's after hours or right 

5

after class  or right after the work, it's 

6

compensable.  There are a whole series of 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Unless it's covered by the 

8

PortaltoPortal Act.  And the Portalto Portal Act is 

9

an exception to that. 

10

 MR. THIERMAN: 

No.  The regulations point 

11

blank say it's covered.  There's no PortaltoPortal Act 

12

argument on those regulations. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The notion that if it is 

14

compensable work it's covered, there is an exception 

15

to  there's an exception to what the employer 

16

requires.  He can require some things and yet not be 

17

liable for, under  under the Act, to pay for those 

18

things.  That's what the PortaltoPortal Act is about. 

19

 MR. THIERMAN: 

The  and we say those 

20

exceptions that he's not required to pay for are the 

21

transportation to and from the mine, which is (1)(a) 

22

or (a)(1) of the Portal  254(a)(1), and then you don't 

23

get to (a)(2) if it's a  if it's a principal activity. 

24

And the regulations on attending seminars does not 

25

discuss any exemption about way in or way out.  It

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

simply says that if the employer mandates you take a 

2

seminar, no matter what it's on, they have to pay you 

3

for the time. 

4

 So there's no PortaltoPortal Act issue if 

5

it's a principal activity.  And what the regulations of 

6

78  785 say, these are lists of things that are 

7

compensable because the employer told you to do it.  And 

8

it's  whether it's fueling the truck at the end of the 

9

day  you don't need to have the truck fueled at the 

10

end of the day because you're already done driving, so 

11

it's not integral and indispensable to anything.  Those 

12

are the kind of things that the PortaltoPortal Act 

13

doesn't cover because they're principal activities. 

14

 I  I could  I could  sexual harassment 

15

training, another one.  We require employees to go 

16

through sexual harassment training.  Is that a part of 

17

their job?  It's a task.  It's required of them. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 MR. THIERMAN:

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What about checkout? 
Checking out meaning? 
Well, they say this is like 

21

checkout.  You go  you go check out, put your time 

22

card in, check out. 

23

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Yes.  That is, punching in, 

24

punching out is an exception.  Checking in and checking 

25

out is an exception.

53

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

2

mean, what's the theory? 

3

 MR. THIERMAN: 

Why?  What's the theory?  I 

Well, the theory, I think 

4

I  I think that in 1947, that's what they  they 

5

thought it was such a  I don't want to use the word 

6

"de minimis" because it has whole other meaning, 

7

but it's 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But they're thinking 

see, the other side says, well, this is like checking 
out, you know. 
 MR. THIERMAN: 

But it's not.  And that's 

12

and isn't that a factual question for a jury?  But it's 

13

not.  It's not like checking out because they've already 

14

checked out and you don't check out twice.  I mean, you 

15

don't.  You don't check out twice.  And the difference 

16

between checking in  because, like, I don't have a 

17

checkout example  but the difference in checking in 

18

and a roll call  and  and you must get paid for roll 

19

calls  is that the employer tells you to be there at a 

20

certain time and do this thing where  and that's 

21

compensable.  But if a  so if you guild or if you put 

22

the one straw on top of the checking out, you break the 

23

camel.  And  and it's a very, very small exception, 

24

because generally speaking, we want people not to work 

25

off the clock, because this is what this case is all

Mr. Clement you have 

four minutes. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Just a few points in rebuttal. 

12

 I'd like to start with what is the linchpin 

13

of principal activities.  Principal activities is 

14

obviously a term introduced to the Act by the 

15

PortaltoPortal Act.  The regulations define that as 

16

work of consequence.  Now, my friend would like you to 

17

say that the linchpin is whether it's required.  Here's 

18

why that makes no sense at all.  Whether you get into 

19

the Fair Labor Standards Act in the first instance is 

20

determined by whether it's required.  Now, it doesn't 

21

much  do much good for Congress to say, don't worry 

22

about that, employers.  We have an exception for you. 

23

But the exception is also never satisfied as long as 

24

it's required.  That would give the exception no 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That isn't really, I think,

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

their main point.  I think this is  this isn't really 

2

like they say, just checking out.  What it is more like 

3

is drug testing.  You heard the argument.  Drug 

4

testing 

5

 MR. CLEMENT: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I heard their argument. 
 a seminar that you'd 

7

have on the thing about sexual harassment, da, da, da. 

8

Okay.  So what is your response? 

9

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Especially as my friend 

10

describes drug testing, it doesn't sound like any 

11

logical part of the egress process.  And I think that's 

12

why those things are not covered.  They're not covered 

13

not because 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But you, certainly, 

15

Mr. Clement, make it part of the egress process.  I 

16

mean, if this is just ingress/egress and I  I  seems 

17

as though that's part of what the PortaltoPortal Act 

18

does.  Why not make it part of the egress process and 

19

then there would be a wholly different outcome; is that 

20

right? 

21

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, no, I don't think so.  I 

22

think at some point, the Court can obviously take 

23

police employers that want to lard on things that have 

24

nothing to do with the egress process and say you've got 

25

a wash my car on the way out.  And as he describes the

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

drug testing process, you're actually diverted from your 

2

process of exiting.  You're escorted  escorted to 

3

to the restroom and monitored while you do it.  It 

4

doesn't sound anything like an egress process. 

5

 And those activities are covered not because 

6

they are postliminary activities that are integral and 

7

indispensable.  Those activities are covered because 

8

they're work under the FLSA and the portaltoportal 

9

exceptions for postliminary and preliminary activity 

10

simply don't apply.  And that covers car washing; it 

11

covers drug testing; it covers also these videos.  It 

12

really is quite different.  But the checkout process, 

13

which is part of the egress process, really does make 

14

this very close. 

15

 One other point of clarification on this, 

16

Justice Scalia, you were exactly right when you said the 

17

785 series, which they want to rely on, are about hours 

18

worked under the Fair Labor Standards Act.  They say 

19

what's in the universe of things that are potentially 

20

subject to the exceptions of the PortaltoPortal Act. 

21

 The principal activities is defined in the 

22

regulations in the 790 series, which is all about the 

23

PortaltoPortal Act and 790.A is helpfully entitled 

24

principal activities.  What are principal activities? 

25

Not anything that the employer requires, but work of

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consequence and that gets you to this concept that work 

2

of consequence is things like cutting grapefruit or 

3

preparing every work station in the facility or driving 

4

the bus that gets people to the mine.  Work of 

5

consequence is not checking in and checking out.  It is 

6

not going through security.  Nobody gets paid to go 

7

through security all day.  Now, it also  nobody gets 

8

paid take a bath all day either.  And so that's why 

9

that's not a complete test.  You still have to ask the 

10

final question, which is whether it's integral and 

11

indispensable to the principal activities. 

12

 Now, my friends really don't want to talk 

13

about that, I think, with good reason because this 

14

clearly is not integral and indispensable.  And I don't 

15

think you can make not stealing indispensable to the 

16

workday; otherwise, all these employees could stay home 

17

away from the  the merchandise and they'd never steal 

18

a thing and that would be their work function.  It just 

19

doesn't work.  The work function is to fulfill the 

20

orders. 

21

 I want to say one last thing about your 

22

opening hypothetical, Justice Kagan.  There is another 

23

difference between your hypothetical and this situation, 

24

which at least as I understood your hypothetical, if an 

25

employee has to stay at their work station and while a

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

20minute process goes on, that's the employer requiring 

2

them to be on the premises for an extra 20 minutes. 

3

That's much more like being engaged to wait than waiting 

4

to engage. 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I gave it to you two ways. 

6

And one was at your work station and the other was an 

7

employer, who knowing that there was this ingress/egress 

8

rule, made it part of the ingress/egress process.  So 

9

that's my other question repeated again. 

10

 MR. CLEMENT: 

But  but even as to the 

11

modified hypothetical, if you have to stay on the 

12

employer's premises for an extra 20 minutes, that's 

13

closer to being engaged to wait as opposed to waiting to 

14

engage.  The allegations here are not that this process 

15

takes 25 minutes.  It can take up to 25 minutes if 

16

you're in the very back of the line.  And I think one of 

17

the many reasons not to adopt their rule is you don't 

18

want to create an incentive for every employee to try to 

19

get to the back of the line, which is hardly going to 

20

speed things up. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22
