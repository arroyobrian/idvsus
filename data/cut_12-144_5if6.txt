We'll hear argument

this morning in Case 12-144, Hollingsworth v. Perry.
Mr. Cooper?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. COOPER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

New York's highest court, in a case similar

11

to this one, remarked that until quite recently, it was

12

an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived in

13

any society in which marriage existed.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Marriage --

Mr. Cooper, we have

15

jurisdictional and merits issues here.

16

best if you could begin with the standing issue.

17
18
19

MR. COOPER:

Maybe it'd be

I'd be happy to,

Mr. Chief Justice.
Your Honor, the official proponents of

20

Proposition 8, the initiative, have standing to defend

21

that measure before this Court as representatives of the

22

people and the State of California to defend the

23

validity of a measure that they brought forward.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Have we ever granted

standing to proponents of ballot initiatives?

MR. COOPER:

No, Your Honor, the Court has 


2

not done that, but the Court has never had before it a 


3

clear expression from a unanimous State's high court 


4

that --


5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, this is -- this

6

is -- the concern is certainly, the proponents are

7

interested in getting it on the ballot and seeing that

8

all of the proper procedures are followed, but once it's

9

passed, they have no proprietary interest in it.

It's

10

law for them just as it is for everyone else.

11

are they distinguishable from the California citizenry

12

in general?

13

MR. COOPER:

So how

They're distinguishable, Your

14

Honor, because the Constitution of the State of

15

California and its election code provide, according to

16

the unanimous interpretation of the California Supreme

17

Court, that the official proponents, in addition to the

18

other official responsibilities and authorities that

19

they have in the initiative process, that those official

20

proponents also have the authority and the

21

responsibility to defend the validity of that

22

initiative --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess the attorney

24

general of this State doesn't have any proprietary

25

interest either, does he?

can defend it.

MR. COOPER:

That's right, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

assign to any citizen the rights to defend a judgment of

13

this kind?

14

MR. COOPER:

Justice Kagan, that would be

15

a -- a very tough question.

16

the question before the Court because -- because it

17

isn't any citizen.

19

carefully detailed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MR. COOPER:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that would

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

That -- that

6

may be true in terms of who they want to represent,

7

but -- but a State can't authorize anyone to proceed in

8

Federal court because that would leave the definition

9

under Article III of the Federal Constitution as to who

10

can bring -- who has standing to bring claims up to each

11

State.

12

like that.

13

And I don't think we've ever allowed anything

MR. COOPER:

But -- but, Your Honor, I guess

14

the point I want to make is that there is no question

15

the State has standing.

16

to represent its own interests in the validity of its

17

own enactments.

18

decline to do that, it is within the State's authority

19

surely, I would submit, to identify, if not all -- any

20

citizen or at least supporter of -- of the measure,

21

certainly those, that that very clear and identifiable

22

group of citizens --

23

The State itself has standing

And if the State's public officials

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the Chief -- the

24

Chief Justice and Justice Kagan have given a proper

25

hypothetical to test your theory.

But in this case the

Official

proponents, number one, must give their official 


2

address, they must pay money, and they must all act in 


3

unison under California law.

4

were required at all times to act in unison, so that 


5

distinguishes -- and to register and to pay money for 


6

the -- so in that sense it's different from simply 


7

saying any citizen.

10

MR. COOPER:

So these five proponents 


But of course it is, and I 


think the key --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But can you tell me --

11

that's a factual background with respect to their right

12

to put the ballot initiative on the ballot, but how does

13

it create an injury to them separate from that of every

14

other taxpayer to have laws enforced?

15

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, the -- the question

16

before the Court, I would submit, is not the injury to

17

the individual proponents, it's the injury to the State.

18

The -- the legislators in the Karcher case had no

19

individual particularized injury, and yet this Court

20

recognized they were proper representatives of the

21

State's interests -- the State's injury --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

At least one of the

23

amici have suggested that it seems counterintuitive to

24

think that the State is going to delegate to people who

25

don't have a fiduciary duty to them.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

That it's going to

Official

1

delegate the responsibility of representing the State to

2

individuals who have their own views.

3

ballot initiative because it was their individual views,

4

not necessarily that of the State.

5

MR. COOPER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They proposed the

So --

Well --

-- Justice Scalia 


7

proffered the question of the Attorney General.

8

Attorney General has no personal interest. 


9

MR. COOPER:

10
11
12

True.

The 


No --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He has a fiduciary

obligation.
MR. COOPER:

The Attorney General, whether

13

it's a fiduciary obligation or not, is in normal

14

circumstances the representative of the State to defend

15

the validity of the State's enactments when they are

16

challenged in Federal court.

17

doesn't do so, the State surely has every authority and

18

I would submit the responsibility to identify

19

particularly in an initiative -- an initiative context.

20

But when that officer

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why isn't the fiduciary

21

duty requirements before the State can designate a

22

representative an important one?

23

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, I would submit to

24

you that I don't think there's anything in Article III

25

or in any of this Court's decisions that suggest that a
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

representative of a State must be -- have a fiduciary 


2

duty, but I would also suggest --


3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, generally you 


4

don't need to specify it because generally the people 


5

who get to enforce the legislation of the government are

6

people who are in government positions elected by the

7

people.

8

MR. COOPER:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And Your Honor -Here these individuals

10

are not elected by the people or appointed by the

11

people.

12

MR. COOPER:

And the California Supreme

13

Court specifically addressed and rejected that specific

14

argument.

15

public officials, the elected officials, the appointed

16

officials, have declined, have declined to defend a

17

statute.

18

case a constitutional amendment, was brought forward by

19

the initiative process.

20

They said it is in the context when the

A statute that, by the way, excuse me, in this

The Court said it is essential to the

21

integrity, integrity of the initiative process in that

22

State, which is a precious right of every citizen.

23

initiative process in that State, to ensure that when

24

public officials -- and after all, the initiative

25

process is designed to control those very public
9

The

Official

officials, to take issues out of their hands. 


2

And if public officials could effectively 


3

veto an initiative by refusing to appeal it, then the 


4

initiative process would be invalidated. 


5

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -- historically, I 


6

think, 40 States, many States have what was called a 


7

public action.

8

citizen primarily to vindicate the interest in seeing 


9

that the law is enforced. 


A public action is an action by any 


10

MR. COOPER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

In California -Now, that's the kind of

12

action I think that this Court has interpreted the

13

Constitution of the United States, case in controversy,

14

to say that it does not lie in the Federal system.

15

And of course, if that kind of action is the

16

very kind that does not lie, well, then to say, but they

17

really feel it's important that the law be enforced,

18

they really want to vindicate the process, and these are

19

people of special interests.

20

citizens who most strongly want to vindicate the

21

interest in the law being enforced and the process for

22

making the law be enforced, well, that won't distinguish

23

it from a public action.

interest and have good reason for thinking it.

They are

So you have read all these arguments that

8

9

MR. COOPER:

What do you

What I want to say, Your Honor,

10

is that according to the California Supreme Court, the

11

California Constitution says in terms that among the

12

responsibilities of official proponents, in addition to

13

the many other responsibilities that they step forward

14

and they assume in the initiative process, among those

15

responsibilities and authorities is to defend that

16

initiative if the public officials, which the initiative

17

process is designed to control, have refused to do it.

18

It might as well say it in those terms, Your Honor.

to proceed to the merits, you should feel free to do so.

changing and changing rapidly in this country as people

2

throughout the country engage in an earnest debate over

3

whether the age-old definition of marriage should be

4

changed to include same-sex couples.

5

The question before this Court is whether

6

the Constitution puts a stop to that ongoing democratic

7

debate and answers this question for all 50 States.

8

it does so only if the Respondents are correct that no

9

rational, thoughtful person of goodwill could possibly

10

disagree with them, in good faith, on this agonizingly

11

difficult issue.

And

The issues, the constitutional issues that

13

have been presented to the Court, are not of first

question.

In Baker against Nelson, this Court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Cooper, Baker v.

Nelson was 1971.

19

that gender-based classifications get any kind of

20

heightened scrutiny.

The Supreme Court hadn't even decided

MR. COOPER:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is -And the same-sex intimate

MR. COOPER:

Well, Your Honor, certainly I

dismissal.

4

fast on the heels of the Loving decision.

5

Honor, I simply make the observation that it seems

6

implausible in the extreme, frankly, for nine justices

7

to have -- to have seen no substantial Federal question

8

if it is true, as the Respondents maintain, that the

9

traditional definition of marriage, insofar as -- insofar

10

as it does not include same-sex couples, insofar as it is

a gender definition, is irrational and can only be

explained -- can only be explained, as a result of

23

a superseded opinion, has agreed that it is not a

gender-based classification, but I guess it is gender

4

it's gendered in that sense. 


5

And so in the same way


But we -- we agree that to the extent that

6

the classification impacts, as it clearly does, same-sex

7

couples, that -- that classification can be viewed as

8

being one of sexual orientation rather than --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Outside of the --

10

outside of the marriage context, can you think of any

11

other rational basis, reason for a State using sexual

12

orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits

13

or imposing burdens on them?

14

rational decision-making that the government could make?

15

Denying them a job, not granting them benefits of some

16

sort, any other decision?

if that is true, then why aren't they a class?

22

23

improper, irrational, then why aren't we treating them

24

as a class for this one benefit?

25

interest of marriage is so much more compelling than any

If

Are you saying that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

other interest as they could have? 


2

MR. COOPER:

No, Your Honor, we certainly


We -- we are saying the interest in marriage 


3

are not.

4

and the -- and the State's interest and society's 


5

interest in what we have framed as responsible pro --

6

procreation is -- is vital, but at bottom, with respect

7

to those interests, our submission is that same-sex

8

couples and opposite-sex couples are simply not

9

similarly situated.

10

But to come back to your precise question, I

11

think, Justice Sotomayor, you're -- you're probing into

12

whether or not sexual orientation ought to be viewed as

13

a quasi-suspect or suspect class, and our position is

14

that it does not qualify under this Court's standard

15

and -- and traditional tests for identifying

16

suspectedness.

17

amorphous.

18

Plaintiffs' own experts were -- were quite vivid on.

19

It -- it does not -- it -- it does not qualify as an

20

accident of birth, immutability in that -- in that

21

sense.

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

the government is not free to discriminate against them?
MR. COOPER:

Well, Your Honor, I would think

3

that -- that -- I think it's a -- it's a very different

4

question whether or not the government can proceed

5

arbitrarily and irrationally with respect to any group 


6

of people, regardless of whether or not they qualify 


7

under this Court's traditional test for suspectedness. 


8

And -- and the hypothetical I understood you to be 


9

offering, I would submit would create -- it would --


10

unless there's something that -- that is not occurring

11

to me immediately, an arbitrary and capricious

12

distinction among similarly situated individuals,

13

that -- that is not what we think is at the -- at the

14

root of the traditional definition of marriage.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Cooper, could I just

16

understand your argument.

17

it seems as though your principal argument is that

18

same-sex and opposite -- sex couples are not similarly

19

situated because opposite-sex couples can procreate,

20

same-sex couples cannot, and the State's principal

21

interest in marriage is in regulating procreation.

22

that basically correct?

MR. COOPER:

But do you go further and say that it

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, we -- we go further

8

in -- in the sense that it is reasonable to be very

9

concerned that redefining marriage to -- as a genderless

10

institution could well lead over time to harms to that

11

institution and to the interests that society has

12

always -- has -- has always used that institution to

13

address.

MR. COOPER:

Once again, I -- I would

22

reiterate that we don't believe that's the correct legal

question before the Court, and that the correct question

is whether or not redefining marriage to include

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but, then it -- then

it seems to me that you should have to address Justice
Kagan's question.
MR. COOPER:

Thank you, Justice Kennedy.

I

have two points to make on them.
The first one is this, the Plaintiffs'

14

expert acknowledged that redefining marriage will have

15

real-world consequences, and that it is impossible for

16

anyone to foresee the future accurately enough to know

17

exactly what those real-world consequences would be.

18

And among those real-world consequences, Your Honor, we

19

would suggest are adverse consequences.

20

But consider the California voter, in 2008,

21

in the ballot booth, with the question before her

22

whether or not this age-old bedrock social institution

23

should be fundamentally redefined, and knowing that

24

there's no way that she or anyone else could possibly

25

know what the long-term implications of a profound
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

redefinition of a bedrock social institution would be.

2

That is reason enough, Your Honor, that would hardly be

3

irrational for that voter to say, I believe that this

4

experiment, which is now only fairly four years old,

5

even in Massachusetts, the oldest State that is

6

conducting it, to say, I think it better for California

7

to hit the pause button and await additional information

8

from the jurisdictions where this experiment is still

9

maturing.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

me give you one -- one concrete thing.

you don't mention some concrete things.

marriage to include same-sex couples, you must -- you

14

must permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's --

15

there's considerable disagreement among -- among

16

sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a

17

child in a -- in a single-sex family, whether that is

18

harmful to the child or not.

19

not permit adoption by same-sex couples for that reason.

I don't know why

irrelevant.

applies to States other than California, that every

16

State must allow marriage by same-sex couples.

17

even though States that believe it is harmful -- and I

18

take no position on whether it's harmful or not, but it

19

is certainly true that -- that there's no scientific

20

answer to that question at this point in time.

21

They're arguing for a nationwide rule which

MR. COOPER:

And so

And -- and that, Your Honor, is

22

the point I am trying to make, and it is the

23

Respondents' responsibility to prove, under rational

24

basis review, not only that -- that there clearly will

25

be no harm, but that it's beyond debate that there will

be no harm.

defending -- you are opposing a judgment that applies to

concerns about redefining marriage in -- in California

could be confined to California, but they cannot, Your

10
11

Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I think there's --

12

there's substantial -- that there's substance to the

13

point that sociological information is new.

14

five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years

15

of history or more.

16

We have

On the other hand, there is an immediate

17

legal injury or legal -- what could be a legal injury,

18

and that's the voice of these children.

19

40,000 children in California, according to the Red

20

Brief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want

21

their parents to have full recognition and full status.

22

The voice of those children is important in this case,

23

don't you think?

24
25

MR. COOPER:

There are some

Your Honor, I certainly would

not dispute the importance of that consideration.

That

consideration especially in the political process where

2

this issue is being debated and will continue to be

3

debated, certainly, in California.

4

elsewhere.

5

Your Honor, there -- there simply is no data.

6

It's being debated

But on that -- on that specific question,

In fact, their expert agreed there is no

7

data, no study, even, that would examine whether or not

8

there is any incremental beneficial effect from marriage

9

over and above the domestic partnership laws that were

10

enacted by the State of California to recognize,

11

support, and honor same-sex relationships and their

12

families.

13

that would permit one to draw -- draw that conclusion.

14

I would recall, Justice Kennedy, the point

There is simply no data at all that would --

15

made in Romer, that under a rational basis of review,

16

the provision will be sustained even if it operates to

17

the disadvantage of a group, if it is -- if it otherwise

18

advances rationally a legitimate State interest.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

MR. COOPER:

Oh -As long as you are on that,

24

then I would like to ask you this, assume you could

25

distinguish California, suppose we accept your argument
22

Alderson Reporting Company

1

or accept Justice Scalia's version of your argument and

2

that distinguishes California.

3

California.

4

gay couples to marry would interfere with the vision of

5

marriage, as procreation of children, that allowing

6

sterile companies -- couples of different sexes to marry

7

would not?

8
9

Now, let's look at

What precisely is the way in which allowing

I mean, there are lots of people who get
married who can't have children.

And so take a State

10

that does allow adoption and say -- there, what is the

11

justification for saying no gay marriage?

12

the one you said, is it?

Certainly not

13

MR. COOPER:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

Look, you said that the problem is marriage

16

You're -Am I not clear?

as an institution that furthers procreation.

17

MR. COOPER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, Your Honor.
And the reason there was

19

adoption, but that doesn't apply to California.

20

imagine I wall off California and I'm looking just

21

there, where you say that doesn't apply.

22

happens to your argument about the institution of

23

marriage as a tool towards procreation?

24

that, in California, too, couples that aren't gay, but

25

can't have children get married all the time.
23

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Now, what

Given the fact

Official

1

MR. COOPER:

Yes, Your Honor.

The concern

2

is that redefining marriage as a genderless institution

3

will sever its abiding connection to its historic

4

traditional procreative purposes and it will refocus,

5

refocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of 


6

marriage away from the raising of children and to the 


7

emotional needs and desires of adults -- of adult 


8

couples. 


9

Suppose, in turn --


10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, suppose a State

11

said -- Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said because we

12

think that the focus of marriage really should be on

13

procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses

14

anymore to any couple where both people are over the age

15

of 55.

Would that be constitutional?

16
17

MR. COOPER:

No, Your Honor, it would not be

constitutional.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because that's the same

19

State interest, I would think, you know.

20

over the age of 55, you don't help us serve the

21

government's interest in regulating procreation through

22

marriage.

23

If you are

So why is that different?
MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, even with respect

24

to couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that both

25

couples -- both parties to the couple are infertile, and

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, really, because if a

4

couple -- I can just assure you, if both the woman and

5

the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of

6

children coming out of that marriage.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, society's --

society's interest in responsible procreation isn't just

with respect to the procreative capacities of the couple

making it more likely that neither party, including the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suspect this Court would

hold that to be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy,

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

18

I know that you will want me to spend a

20

before I do that, I thought that it would be important

21

for this Court to have Proposition 8 put in context,

22

what it does.

23

It walls-off gay and lesbians from

24

marriage, the most important relation in life, according

25

to this Court, thus stigmatizing a class of Californians

based upon their status and labeling their most

I was trying to avoid that, Your

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know --

Well, I think it's

12

only fair to treat you the same.

13

address your jurisdictional argument?

14

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

Perhaps you could

I think that our

15

jurisdictional argument is, as we set forth in the

16

brief, California cannot create Article III standing by

17

designating whoever it wants to defend the State of

18

California in connection with the ballot.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But this is not whoever it

20

wants.

21

and if we were to accept your argument, it would give

22

the State a one-way ratchet.

23

make a defense, maybe a half-hearted defense of the

24

statute, and -- and then when the statute is held

25

invalid, simply -- simply leave.

These are five proponents of -- of the measure

The State could go in and

On the other hand,

Alderson Reporting Company

governor, so that if the Attorney General and the

attorney where there's a perceived conflict of

interest --

responsibility for the State and might have

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose there

standing, someone who performs marriages and would like

So start from the proposition that a State

The question then is, who 


Now, in a State that has initiative, the 


3
4

whole process would be defeated if the only people who 


5

could defend the statute are the elected public

6

officials.

7

I do because you're from California -- the whole point

8

of the initiative process was to allow the people to

9

circumvent public officials about whom they were

10
11

The whole point -- you know this better than

suspicious.
So if you reject that proposition, what is

12

left is the proposition that the State -- State law can

13

choose some other person, some other group to defend the

constitutionality of a State law.

case are precisely those people.

proponents, whoever they were, and this could be

MR. OLSON:

the case that's before you today is whether or not

California can take a class of individuals based upon

their characteristics, their distinguishing

characteristics, remove from them the right of privacy,

liberty, association, spirituality, and identity that --

that marriage gives them.

It -- it is -- it is not an answer to say

20

procreation or anything of that nature because

21

procreation is not a part of the right to get married.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's really -- that's a

23

broad argument that you -- that's in this case if the

24

Court wants to reach it.

The rationale of the Ninth
It basically said that

42

Alderson Reporting Company

1

California, which has been more generous, more open to

2

protecting same-sex couples than almost any State in the

3

Union, just didn't go far enough and it's being

4

penalized for not going far enough.

5
6
7

That's a very odd rationale on which to
sustain this opinion.
MR. OLSON:

This Court has always looked

8

into the context.

9

involving the gambling casinos and advertising, you look

In, for example, the New Orleans case

10

at the context of what was permitted, what was not

11

permitted, and does that rationalization for prohibiting

12

in that case the advertising, in this case prohibiting

13

the relationship of marriage, does it make any sense in

14

the context of what exists?

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Oh seriously, Mr. Olson,

16

if California provides all the substantive benefits of

17

marriage to same-sex domestic partnerships, are you

18

seriously arguing that if California -- if the State --

19

if the case before us now were from a State that doesn't

20

provide any of those benefits to same-sex couples, this

21

case would come out differently?

22

MR. OLSON:

No, I don't think it would come

23

out differently because of the fundamental arguments

24

we're making with respect to class-based distinctions

25

with respect to a fundamental right.
43

Alderson Reporting Company

However, to the

Official

1

extent that my opponent in the context of California, 


2

talks about child-rearing or adoptions or -- or of


3

rights of people to live together and that sort of 


4

thing, those arguments can't be made on behalf of 


5

California because California's already made a decision

6

that gay and lesbian individuals are perfectly suitable

7

as parents, they're perfectly suitable to adopt, they're

8

raising 37,000 children in California, and the expert on

9

the other side specifically said and testified that they

would be better off when their parents were allowed to

get married.

I don't think you can have

it both ways.

be the same if this were Utah or Oklahoma or it's

provided all these --

MR. OLSON:

I -- I think that it's not that

19

the fundamental thing is that denying gays and lesbians

20

the right of marriage, which is fundamental under your

decisions, that is unconstitutional.

Sure.

If you

tell -- if you tell a child that somebody has to be

their friend, I suppose you can force the child to say,

15

it means to be a friend.

that I'm interested in the answer, if you say that

accept that the State has probably an overbearing

interest on -- on protecting a child until they're of

7

age to marry, but what's left?

9

Meaning, what State restrictions with

MR. OLSON:

Well, you've said -- you've said

in the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy

issue, multiple marriages raises questions about

11

exploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to

12

taxes, inheritance, child custody, it is an entirely

13

different thing.

14

polygamy, it's prohibiting conduct.

15

And if you -- if a State prohibits

If it prohibits gay and lesbian citizens

16

from getting married, it is prohibiting their exercise

17

of a right based upon their status.

18

as a class, as you described in the Romer case and as

19

you described in the Lawrence case and in other cases,

20

you're picking out a group of individuals to deny them

21

the freedom that you've said is fundamental, important,

22

and vital in this society, and it has status and

stature, as you pointed out in the VMI case.

2

not Article III standing here because -- I don't want to

4

we don't have a formal position.

5

But we do think that with respect to

6

standing, that at this point with the initiative process

7

over, that Petitioners really have what is more in the

nature of a generalized grievance and because they're

9

not an agent of the State of California or don't have

the better conclusion is that there's not Article III

standing here.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, tomorrow you're going

interests are, Justice Alito, in tomorrow's issues where

21

we have briefed the matter thoroughly and will be

22

prepared to discuss it with the Court tomorrow.

23

With respect to the merits, two fundamental

24

points lead to the conclusion that there's an equal

25

protection violation here.

First, every warning flag

51

Alderson Reporting Company

that warrants exacting scrutiny is present in this case.

2

And Petitioners' defense of Proposition 8 requires the

3

Court to ignore those warning flags and instead apply

4

highly deferential Lee Optical rational basis review as

though Proposition 8 were on a par with the law of

6

treating opticians less favorably than optometrists,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Verrilli, I could

understand your argument if you were talking about the

10

entire United States, but you -- your brief says it's

11

only eight or nine States, the States that permit civil

12

unions, and that's -- brings up a question that was

13

asked before.

14

progress has to go all the way, but at least the

15

government's position is, if it has done -- the State

16

has done absolutely nothing at all, then it's -- it can

17

do -- do as it will.

18

So a State that has made considerable

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I -- that gets to my

19

second point, Your Honor, which is that I do think the

20

problem here with the arguments that Petitioners are

21

advancing is that California's own laws do cut the legs

22

out from under all of the justifications that

23

Petitioners have offered in defense of Proposition 8.

24

And I understand Your Honor's point and the point that

25

Justice Kennedy raised earlier, but I do think this
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court's equal protection jurisprudence requires the

2

Court to evaluate the interests that the State puts

3

forward, not in a vacuum, but in the context of the

4

actual substance of California law.

5

And here, with respect to California law,

6

gay and lesbian couples do have the legal rights and

7

benefits of marriage, full equality and adoption, full

8

access to assistive reproduction, and therefore, the

9

argument about the State's interests that -- that

10

Petitioners advance have to be tested against that

reality, and -- and they just don't measure up.

more than a State that does something.

opinion, that would be good enough to overcome for the

what we're saying about that is that we're not prepared

19

to close the door to an argument in another State where

20

the State's interests haven't cut the legs out from

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, just in response to

that, of course the Constitution could be amended,

15

21

same-sex marriage is not required throughout the

22

country?

23

GENERAL VERRILLI:

We are not -- we are not

24

taking the position that it is required throughout the

25

We think that that ought to be left open for a

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So your -- your position is

only if a State allows civil unions does it become

5

unconstitutional to forbid same-sex marriage, right?

6
7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I -- I see my red light

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, you can go on.

Thank you.

10

Our position is -- I would just take out a

11

red pen and take the word "only" out of that sentence.

12

When that is true, then the Equal Protection Clause

13

forbids the exclusion of same-sex marriage and it's an

14

open question otherwise.

15
16

And if I could just get to the third reason,
which I do think is quite significant.

So it's got to

Well, we think -But you can wait in

States where they have fewer legal rights.

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

What I said is it's an

15

open question with respect to those States and the Court

16

should wait and see what kind of a record a State could

17

make.

18

justify the exclusion.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

25

60

Alderson Reporting Company

1

And the fourth point I would make, and I do

2

think this is significant, is that the principal

3

argument in 1967, with respect to Loving and that the

4

Commonwealth of Virginia advanced was, well, the social

5

science is still uncertain about how biracial children

6

will fare in this world, and so you ought to apply

7

rational basis scrutiny and wait.

8

recognized that there is a cost to waiting and that that

9

has got to be part of the equal protection calculus.

10

And so -- so I do think that's quite fundamental.

11
12

And I think the Court

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I ask you a

problem about --

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure.
-- I -- it seems to

15

me that your position that you are supporting is

16

somewhat internally inconsistent.

17

made that there is no problem with extending marriage to

18

same-sex couples because children raised by same-sex

19

couples are doing just fine and there is no evidence

20

that they are being harmed.

21

We see the argument

And the other argument is Proposition 8

22

harms children by not allowing same-sex couples to

23

marriage.

24
25

Which is it?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I -- I think what

Proposition 8 does is deny the long-term stabilizing

effect that marriage brings.

2

argument for -- for marriage, that --

3

That's -- that's the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you also tell me

4

there has been no harm shown to children of same-sex

5

couples.

6

GENERAL VERRILLI:

California -- there are

7

37,000 children in same-sex families in California now.

8

Their parents cannot marry and that has effects on them

9

in the here and now.

10

A stabilizing effect is not there.

When

11

they go to school, they have to -- you know -- they

12

don't have parents like everybody else's parents.

13

That's a real effect, a real cost in the here and now.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the real cost right

15

now would be you're asking me to write these words, "a

16

State that has a pact has to say 'marriage,'"

17

not telling you about States that don't.

18

guess there is a real-world effect there, too.

19

States that are considering pacts will all say, we won't

do it, or not all, but some would.

but I'm

Well, I would
That

And that would have a real effect right now.

It's impossible to limit these -- these

propositions to any particular jurisdiction, so this

to same-sex marriage if it should simply decide to

6

dismiss the writ as improvidently granted,

7

Justice Kennedy.

8
9

And let's -- let's just step back and just
consider for a moment the Solicitor General's argument.

10

He is basically submitting to the Court that essentially

11

the one compromise that is not available to the States

12

is the one that the State of California has undertaken.

13

That is, to go as far as the people possibly can in --

14

in honoring and recognizing the families and the

15

relationships of same-sex couples, while still

16

preserving the existence of traditional marriage as an

17

institution.

18

That's the one thing that's off the table.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought he was saying

19

-- I thought he was saying, Mr. Cooper, that it's not

20

before the Court today.

23

was marriage.

22

MR. COOPER:

23

24

the Respondents mentioned the Loving case because what

25

this Court -- what this Court ultimately said was

And -- you know, I'm glad that counsel for

67

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

patently obvious, is that the colors of the skin of the

2

spouses is irrelevant to any legitimate purpose, no more

3

so than their hair colors, any legitimate purpose of

4

marriage, that interracial couples and same-race couples

5

are similarly situated in every respect with respect to

6

any legitimate purpose of marriage.

7

That's what this question really boils down

8

here, whether or not it can be said that for every

9

legitimate purpose of marriage, are opposite-sex couples

10

and same-sex couples indistinguishable?

11

Indistinguishable.

12

and to the Respondents, that is not a hard question.

13

And with all due respect to counsel

If, in fact, it is true, as the people of

14

California believe that it still is true, that the

15

natural procreative capacity of opposite-sex couples

16

continues to pose vitally important benefits and risks

17

to society and that's why marriage itself is the

18

institution that society has always used to regulate

19

those heterosexual, procreative -- procreative

20

relationships.

21

Counsel -- the Solicitor General has said

22

that -- that the ban that the proposition erects in

23

24

is not the view of the Respondents and what we read
