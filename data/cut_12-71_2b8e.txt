CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 12-71, Arizona v. the Inter

5

Tribal Council of Arizona.

General Horne.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. HORNE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The NVRA should not be construed to preempt

12

Arizona's Proposition 200 for three reasons.

13

prohibiting a State from effectively enforcing the

14

citizenship requirement is so far-reaching that if

15

Congress had intended that, it would have put the

16

prohibition in the statute expressly, which it did not

17

do.

18

from taking sensible precautions to exclude noncitizens

19

from voting.

20

First,

Congressional silence should not disable States

Second, when Congress wanted to expressly

21

prohibit something, it knew how to do it.

It expressly

22

prohibited notarization and other forms of

23

authentication.

24

statutory language that indicates -- that prohibits one

25

thing indicates there's no other implicit prohibition:

This Court has frequently held that

The expressio unius rule.

2

Third, Proposition 200 is consistent with

3

the purposes and objectives of the NVRA because the

4

purpose of the NVRA --

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

the NVRA to simplify registration --

7

MR. HORNE:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

If I see the purpose of

Yes, Your Honor.
-- how is Arizona's

provisions consistent with that objective and purpose?

10

MR. HORNE:

Your Honor --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Given that some of the

12

amici explain that many people don't have the documents

13

that Arizona requires?

14

MR. HORNE:

Yes, Your Honor.

First of all,

15

the -- simplifying the procedure is one of two important

16

purposes of the NVRA.

17

system --

18
19
20

The other is the integrity of the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but why does one

take precedence over another?
MR. HORNE:

I would say, Your Honor, that

21

neither takes precedence over the other.

22

equally important.

23

They're both

And so --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, if something you do

24

conflicts with one of those purposes, why isn't it

25

preempted by the Federal law?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. HORNE:

Your Honor, I think the question

2

is, if you take the two purposes together, does -- does

3

the Proposition 200 strongly fulfill one and have a

4

minimal burden on the other?

5

rely on the findings of the -- of the district court in

6

this case.

7

Circuit to defer to the factual findings of the district

8

court in the Purcell case, which was this case in an

9

earlier stage.

And, Your Honor, I would

10

In fact, this Court instructed the Ninth

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why would you think that

11

Congress, in doing the short form registration, didn't

12

consider the issue of fraud, and decide that it had

13

arrived at the balance it wanted?

14

MR. HORNE:

Because, Your Honor, the -- the

15

Congress did not specify what the States could or could

16

not do.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it did -- but

18

Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled.

19

And it was to be an attestation, a signed attestation

20

subject to -- to the penalty of perjury.

21

though the Federal form didn't relate to citizenship.

22

It did.

23

citizenship.

So it's not as

And it said this is the way we deal with
Then Arizona adds something else.

24

So I would like, General Horne, for you to

25

respond to a question that's already been raised in --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 6

by the -- the panel that decided this case originally,

2

which was, the statute said -- says each State must

3

accept and use the Federal form, period.

4

of it.

5

That's the end

And then it says, in addition to that, the

6

State can do other things.

7

question thought it was perfectly clear, you use the

8

Federal form, and if you want to do something in

9

addition -- but you must use and accept the Federal Form

10
11

The judge who asked that

and not add something to it.
MR. HORNE:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think it's

12

very clear that this statute does not say the signature

13

is the only thing that the States can use to verify the

14

eligibility of the applicant.

15

term "accept and use," Your Honor, accept and use in

16

ordinary language -- we've given lots of examples in our

17

briefs -- one can accept and use a form for a particular

18

purpose without that form being sufficient to accomplish

19

that purpose.

20

Now, in -- in using the

I came here from Arizona on an airplane.

If

21

the airline said we accept and use an e-mail ticket, you

22

don't need to bring a paper ticket.

23

there and they said, we want to see identification to

24

prove that you are who you say you are, that would not

25

contradict the statement that they are accepting and

They are accepting and using the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, General Horne, wouldn't

4

it contradict it if instead of saying well, we'd like

5

you to offer identification, saying, well, we'd like you

6

also to have a paper ticket.

7

MR. HORNE:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

If they --

That would be inconsistent

with the accept and use language, isn't that right?

10

MR. HORNE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

11

Yes, Your Honor.

12

to our facts, if we had changed the Federal form, I

13

think we would have been in violation.

14

change the Federal form.

15

exactly as it's printed by the Federal government.

16

we --

17

And if I take that analogy to our --

But we did not

We used the Federal form

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

Well, you added something

18

to the Federal form, and that essentially creates a new

19

set of requirements and a new form.

MR. HORNE:

Your Honor, we -- we accept and

21

use the Federal form.

22

evidence that the person is a citizen, that they're

23

eligible to vote.

24

does not bind us to use only the form and nothing else.

25

We ask, in addition to that, for

The form is not exclusive.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The form

Do you -- do you think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 8

1

you could have said -- you know, we have our own State

2

form, which we're allowed to have under the statute.

3

Anybody who requires the Federal form has to append the

4

State form as well.

5

Could you have done that?

6

MR. HORNE:

I think not, Your Honor, because

7

I think that would have been contrary to the purposes

8

and objectives of the Act.

9

consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act.

10

I think what we did is

But if you --

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how do we draw the

12

line?

Where does the line get drawn between adding just

13

your own form, and adding a new set of requirements,

14

which -- you know, you could just as easily have called

15

a form?

16

MR. HORNE:

Because the statute contemplates

17

that it -- that it is the burden of the States to

18

determine the eligibility of the voters.

19

was given the duty to develop the form, and we don't

20

argue with the fact that the form belongs to the EAC.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The -- the EAC

So that form should have

22

included the eligibility requirements that your State

23

demands.

24

Federal form does not require proof of citizenship,

25

unless you consider just the statement that I'm a

And it seems to me your complaint is that the

citizen to be proof of citizenship.

2

But why didn't you challenge the form?

I

3

mean, that's -- that's my problem with this.

4

think that Federal form doesn't make much sense unless

5

it's -- unless it's to be exclusive for Federal voting.

6

And -- and why didn't you challenge the -- the refusal

7

of the Commission to include on the form, as additional

8

State requirements, the proof of citizenship?

9

MR. HORNE:

I frankly

Your Honor, under Section

10

6(a)(1) of the statute, the burden of determining

11

whether the citizen is eligible rests with the State.

12

That --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. HORNE:

Sure.

Sure.

The form belongs to the EAC.

15

The determination of whether the applicant is eligible

16

belongs to us.

17

we're asking for on the form doesn't matter.

18

fulfilling our duty under Section 6(a)(1) by determining

19

the eligibility of the applicant by asking for

20

additional evidence of citizenship.

21

So whether or not they put what -- what

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We are

Well, you're -- you're

22

simply denying then that the Federal government can, so

23

long as it protects the requirements that your State

24

imposes, you're -- you're saying the Federal government

25

cannot prescribe a single form for -- for voter

The responsibility to determine the

Let's assume -- I think -- I think that --

is --

MR. HORNE:

15

the necessary proofs of -- of qualification that the

16

State imposes?

17

What harm is there so long as the Federal

MR. HORNE:

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

18

form is -- cannot be exclusive.

I mean, even the ITCA

19

Respondent and the United States Respondent admit that

20

we can look to external evidence to determine whether

21

the voter is eligible.

22

look at external evidence, but we can't ask the

23

applicant himself, who has the most information, to pull

24

out his driver's license and write down a number.

There's no --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Horne, there --

2

there are a whole list of State-specific requirements

3

that get appended to the form.

4

Scalia was raising the question, did you ask to have

5

Arizona's requirement -- just as the other

6

State-specific requirements -- did you ask the Federal

7

Commission to include, as a State-specific requirement,

8

this proof of citizenship?

9

MR. HORNE:

And I think Justice

We did, Your Honor, and the

10

Commission itself took no action.

11

director rejected our request.

12

has no power to make determinations.

13

explicitly stated that the EAC can act only by a vote of

14

three out of four of its members.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The executive

Congress

And you did nothing more

about that?

17

MR. HORNE:

Yes, sir.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you didn't go to

19

court to say you have to include this as one of the

20

State-specific requirements.

21

Why didn't you do that?

22

MR. HORNE:

23

Your Honor, that -- that was

under a predecessor of mine, so I don't know the reason.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh.

25

Why didn't he do it?

Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

(Laughter.)

2

MR. HORNE:

I'm -- I'm not sure I would be

3

competent to answer for him, Your Honor.

But I think --

4

but I don't think it makes any difference because the

5

form is -- is one thing that we accept and use to

6

determine the eligibility of the voter, but it's not the

7

only thing.

8

My friends on the other side --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have a -- I have a

10

hugely great difficulty, which is, the NVRA says that

11

people can mail in this form.

12

MR. HORNE:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know how your

14

rejection of the mail-in, how you're accepting and using

15

it when you're refusing to register someone when they do

16

exactly what the Federal law permits them to do:

17

it in.

18

disconnect with how you can be saying you're accepting

19

and using, when you're not registering people, when they

20

use it the way the Federal law permits them to.

21

Mail

There -- there's -- I don't -- I have a real big

MR. HORNE:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is the

22

position that the executive director took, that if the

23

form is fully filled out and on its face it shows the

24

person is qualified we must accept the application.

25

then pointed out in our brief that that would mean that

Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official
Page 13

1

even if we had documentary proof that the person was not

2

a citizen, we'd still have to accept the application.

3

In response to that, the Respondent ITCA and

4

the Federal government said, no, you can look at

5

external evidence, if it shows that the person is not a

6

citizen.

7

any basis in the statute for drawing a distinction

8

between our looking to external evidence that we have

9

and our asking the applicant to write down a -- a number

10

So the only question remaining then is there

from his driver's license.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you also ask for an

12

address, for proof of the address, or proof of date of

13

birth?

14

MR. HORNE:

If that were consistent with the

15

purposes and objectives of the Act we could, Your Honor.

16

And in determining that, one would have to weigh our

17

interest in the integrity of the system versus what

18

burdens that places on the --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then again, it seems

20

to me the Federal form, as some of my colleagues have

21

indicated, is not worth very much.

22

MR. HORNE:

Your Honor, the Federal form

23

sets forth certain minimum requirements that -- that

24

have to be met.

25

specifically in Section 7(b)(2) that they must ask for

In fact, the -- the Act says

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 14

1

the signature under oath of the applicant.

2

form also provides under 7(a)(1) that additional things

3

that are necessary to determine the eligibility of the

4

applicant can also be put on the form.

5

The Federal

The EAC chose not to put anything additional

6

on the form, which was their right.

7

But they did set -- set up a system of State-specific

8

requirements.

9

States have the burden of determining whether or not the

10

It was permissive.

I think that reflects the fact that the

eligible -- the applicant is eligible.

11

That's -- that's our burden.

We must accept

12

and use the Federal form as a tool in doing that, but it

13

is not the exclusive tool, and my friends on the other

14

side have admitted that it's not the exclusive tool

15

because they've admitted that if we have documentary

16

evidence the person is not a citizen, we can reject the

17

application.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How could you establish

19

citizenship without having something mailed in, in

20

addition to the form?

21

requirements?

22

license number or some other numbers?

23

could -- you could make them check off place of birth

24

and if that place of birth is not the United States, you

25

could require them to write down some number of -- of

What are the other State-specific

2

numbers that you could demand?

4

MR. HORNE:

Well, some States require the

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. HORNE:

7

Are there -- are there

Okay.

-- which is not -- which is not

provided for in the statute.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. HORNE:

Right.

But the -- but it's not

10

prohibited.

11

that were brought under that, the States were held that

12

they could add it because it's not prohibited.

13

And the States were held in -- in the cases

The State of Louisiana -- inconsistently on

14

the part of the EAC, the State of Louisiana has a

15

requirement that was approved by the EAC and is in the

16

form that says, "If the applicant has neither a

17

Louisiana driver's license, a Louisiana special

18

identification card, or a Social Security number, the

19

applicant shall attach one of the following items to his

20

application:

21

identification, a copy of a current utility bill, bank

22

statement, government check, paycheck or other

23

government document."

24
25

A copy of a current and valid photo

So --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, that's the kind of

thing you should have had and that your predecessor

Official
Page 16

1

should have asked for to be included in the Federal

2

form.

4

MR. HORNE:

Your Honor, the Federal form is

not exclusive.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but, General, doesn't

the -- the statute make the EAC the decision maker with

respect to what can be added to the Federal form?

8

Federal form -- form, you're exactly right, sets a

9

floor.

The

But if you look at Section 7, what Section 7

10

does is to say the EAC gets to decide the minimum

11

necessary, and it consults with the States and the

12

States can come to it and tell it what it needs, and the

13

EAC can take action.

14

according to Section 7 of this statute.

15

But the EAC is driving the bus,

MR. HORNE:

Yes, Your Honor.

The EAC is

16

driving the bus as to the form, but the States are

17

driving the bus as to what is necessary to determine the

18

ultimate --

19

Well, I don't think they're

Page 17

1

provision in the statute which says consistent with

2

determining, the States being able to determine the

3

qualifications.

4

Isn't there a provision which makes it clear

that the Federal form has to make allowance for the

6

States determining the qualifications?

7
8

MR. HORNE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

the -- and the -- but the --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. HORNE:

Now --

The -- the duty of the States,

11

Your Honor, to determine whether or not a voter is

eligible, that is a duty that rests with the State, not

13

with the EAC.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's true.

The EAC can only -But the form has to enable

19

include in the -- in the Federal form in Arizona some

20

indication of proof of citizenship requiring nothing

21

else except oh, I'm a -- check off, I am a citizen,

right?

23

you're willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose

you're willing to violate the perjury laws.

And it seems to me you were quite

MR. HORNE:

Big deal.

If -- if -- if

That's exactly right, Your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 18

1
2

Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I think you should --

3

you should have challenged the commission's refusal

4

to -- to place that evidence in the Federal form.

5

MR. HORNE:

Your Honor, the Federal form

6

is -- is a tool that we have to use to determine the

7

eligibility of the voter, but the ultimate

8

responsibility under -- under Section 6(a)(1) of -- of

9

this very Act is with the States to determine the

10

eligibility of the voter.

11

My friends on the other side are admitting

12

that the -- that we're not stuck with the four corners

13

of the form because -- because we've pointed out that

14

would result in a ridiculous conclusion that we could

15

have documentary proof that the person is not eligible.

16

So, if we're not bound by the four corners of the form,

17

as in the ordinary use of the term "accept and use," we

18

accept and use the form for a specific purpose, but it

19

does -- it is not sufficient to satisfy that purpose.

20

All parties agree to that.

21

The only question is, is there a

22

distinction, which we do not find in the statute,

23

between using external evidence that we already have and

24

asking someone to write down the -- the number on his

25

driver's license, which he is the one that has the most

It's the logical way to do it.

2

there is no Federal register of American citizens.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In fact,

I'm a little bit confused.
Well, I take it -- I take

5

it that -- that counsel on -- on -- on the other side

6

will disagree with that and they say, well, this is --

7

this is the line to be drawn.

8

presumptive evidence of registration and -- and of

9

qualification.

The -- the postcard is

And if you have evidence to the

10

contrary, then it's different.

11

utility of the single form is missing -- is gone.

12

MR. HORNE:

But otherwise, the whole

Your Honor, there -- there is

13

nothing in the statute to draw a distinction between our

14

having other extrinsic evidence, which they agree we can

15

use outside of the form and our asking people to say,

16

write down --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

words that authorize the use of the form.

19

MR. HORNE:

Other than the statutory

Yes, but -- but they don't make

20

the form exclusive.

he found the statute ambiguous, but that with the

12

legislative history there just could be no conclusion,

13

but that Congress rejected your reading.

14

history is very clear that this issue of what States

15

could add to the form was raised and permission to do so

was proposed explicitly and rejected.

But the

1

legislative history here is extremely self-contradictory

2

and one cannot conclude from any part of that

3

legislative history what was the intent of the majority

4

of the Congress.

5

The House committee which dealt with the

6

very act that -- that we have said, "Only the elected

7

officials designated and authorized under State law are

8

charged with responsibility to enroll eligible voters on

9

the list of voters.

The NVRA should not be interpreted

10

in any way to supplant that authority.

The committee is

11

particularly interested in ensuring that election

12

officials continue to make determinations as to

13

applicants' eligibility, such as citizenship, as they're

14

made under current law and practice."

15

And the FEC, which is a predecessor to the

16

EAC, relying on that House committee report, said that

17

an application received by a local voter registration

18

official is only an application and be subject to

19

whatever verification procedures are currently applied

20

to all applications.

In addition, Your Honor --

MR. HORNE:

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Thank you, Your Honor.
Could I ask a different --

can I ask --

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. HORNE:

Could I just add one quick

6

point, and that is that the sponsor of the bill was

7

opposed to that amendment in conference committee,

8

saying it wasn't necessary, that the States could

9

already verify applicants under the existing law, as it

10

was written before that amendment.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's probably a

12

perfectly good answer to this, but I -- I notice that in

13

this Federal law in 7(b), it says what the registration

14

form shall contain.

15

MR. HORNE:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, there are four

17

subsections and only one of those refers to a particular

18

thing, and that is, identifying information.

19

include a statement, including citizenship, saying --

20

that contains an attestation the applicant meets that

21

requirement.

22

MR. HORNE:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. HORNE:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

It shall

Yes, Your Honor.
And under perjury.

Yes.
It says that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Then I look

Official
Page 23

at the Arizona law and it says in Arizona, you have to

2

include like in immigration -- you know, a passport, a

3

birth certificate, and then you have a couple of other

4

things that show you're a citizen, correct?

5

MR. HORNE:

Yes, those are very unusual.

Normally, you just write down the number from your

question.

of the eligibility of the citizen because --

JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't say it wasn't.

I

24

just want to know, since you have right in front of you

25

a birth certificate or the equivalent, what use are you

making of the Federal provision that's there in the

2

form:

I am a citizen.

MR. HORNE:

Well, Your Honor, we are making

use of it and I just mentioned --

5
6

What use are you making of that?

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I know -- I'm sure

you are and then my question is how?

7

MR. HORNE:

By prosecuting -- there have

8

been ten prosecutions in one year alone of people who

9

swore falsely.

10

Out of the hundreds that were caught

swearing falsely, ten, in fact, were prosecuted.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. HORNE:

By?

But that -- but that is not a --

13

that is not a sufficient use or that is not a sufficient

14

measure of determining eligibility because literally

15

hundreds have been caught swearing jury -- jury

16

commissioner forms -- swearing they are not citizens

17

after they had already registered to vote.

18

were caught in their applications to citizenship when

19

they checked and found that they had previously

20

registered to vote and voted.

21

Other people

So -- so we are making use of it, but it is

22

not a -- it is not a functional way to determine

23

eligibility.

24

both the Federal form and the State form as incorporated

25

under Section 4 may ask for such additional information,

And in 7(a)(1), Congress said that -- that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 25

1

only such additional information as is necessary to

2

determine the eligibility of the voter.

3

Congress did not intend to prohibit us from getting

4

additional information as is necessary to determine the

5

eligibility of the voter.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That shows that

General, could -- could I

7

take you back to this distinction that you're making.

8

You said you can't append an additional form, you can't

9

use an additional form, but you can require additional

10

information.

11

MR. HORNE:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So how do -- what's the

13

difference between requiring additional information and

14

requiring an additional form?

15

need information A, B, C, D, E, that's just a form,

16

isn't it?

17

MR. HORNE:

Isn't -- when you say you

No, Your Honor, it's not a form.

18

It's -- it's an instruction to -- to write down on the

19

Federal form a number.

20

Federal form has a block where you write down the number

21

and if you don't have either number -- you can write

22

down a -- a driver's license number, you can write down

23

a naturalization number, you can write down an Indian

24

tribal identification number.

25

those numbers, then you can send in one of these

for additional information is the purposes and

No, Your Honor.

First of all, the Federal form does provide minimums.

You must -- you must answer the questions set forth in

20

the Federal form.

21

First of all -- for two reasons.

But secondly, to the extent we add things to

22

the Federal form, those things must be consistent with

23

the purposes and objectives of the Act.

24

I -- and I justify my assertion that Prop 200 is

25

consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act

Alderson Reporting Company

And I -- and

Official
Page 27

1

by relying on the findings of the trial court that

2

relate exactly to that question, finding that it was a

3

minimal burden, overcome by a major interest that the

4

State have -- has in protecting the integrity of the

5

system, where the -- where the trial judge found a lot

6

of evidence to show that there was voter fraud going on,

7

although not the fault of the individuals, the fault of

8

the organizations that often fool people into signing

9

the form when they don't intend to -- or they don't

10

intend to break the law; but as -- but as against that,

11

that the -- that the burdens are minimal.

12

And the trial court, the district court, had

13

a lot of findings justifying the statement that the

14

burdens are minimal, including the fact, for example,

15

that if all the rejected forms had been accepted, the

16

increase in Hispanic registration would have only have

17

been .1 percent, which is statistically insignificant,

18

including the fact that out of a population of $6

19

million, the plaintiffs, who have all the resources one

20

can imagine, if you look at the list of plaintiffs,

21

could only find one person out of six million people

22

that could not satisfy -- who was entitled to vote, who

23

could not satisfy the requirements of the Act; and a lot

24

of other findings by the trial court.

25

And this Court instructed the Ninth Circuit

Thank you.
Ms. Millett?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Arizona simply disagrees with the balance
that Congress drew.

And when it comes to registration,

10

Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan, you're both correct,

11

the whole point of the Federal form is that Congress had

12

to draw a different balance.

13

in which 40 percent of eligible voters were not

registered because State procedures and burdens were

standing as an obstacle, a barrier between -- in the

citizens and their Federal government.

percent of eligible voters away?
MS. MILLETT:

First of all, with -- with

licenses issued after 1996, October 1996, and those that

The statute --- of the United States.
The statute says that

Arizona must accept and use the Federal form.

What does

that mean?

11

One, the person must be registered if the Federal form

is properly completed and submitted; two, the State may

not make any further inquiry of the person who submits

Maybe you have other definitions, but what

is the -- what do you interpret "accept and use" to

mean?

18

MS. MILLETT:

We interpret "accept and use,"

19

it's mainly the latter, your second one, and that is

20

that it is a limitation on what can be asked of the

21

individual and that's not just from the Section 4

22

language where accept and use comes from.

23

critical here is Section gg-7 which is on 26H of the

this form.

But what's

And that's where they say on

only -- from the applicant, I'm adding that in -- such

3

identifying information essentially as the Commission

4

determines is necessary to allow the State to make its

decision.

6

Now this is not just a ticket into the

7

State's own registration process so they can go thank

8

you very much for throwing it in the garbage can, now do

2

their own evidence that they obtain, whether it's from

3

common one, and make a decision.

Okay.

Now, that's his argument.

Now, your

answer, which would be very helpful to me, is?
MS. MILLETT:

My answer is when you look at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 36

1

26H it's talking about the form.

2

that the commission is the one that decides what is

3

necessary on this form, a decision that wasn't

challenged --

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And first, we know

Is that conclusive or can

that be challenged?

7

MS. MILLETT:

It can certainly be challenged

8

under the Administrative Procedure Act but was not in

9

this case.

10

But it says what is necessary on the form.

11

Now, when you give a -- now when you say what's

12

necessary on a form you're talking about from the

13

applicant.

14

applicant, what can be requested or demanded from the

15

applicant --

So this defines what is necessary from the

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MS. MILLETT:

-- on the form, exactly.

On

18

the form.

And that is the necessary information to let

19

them apply their own tools and make the decisions that

20

the States make --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

But his problem is how do

22

you get to that conclusion?

23

from the language because the language doesn't say that.

24

It says what the Commission can put on the form.

25

doesn't say anything about whether some other agency,

He says you can't get there

It says what you only may

It doesn't say what you only shall require.
MS. MILLETT:

5

But you may require that is

6

necessary to enable.

7

fair reading -- and we don't strain the language in this

8

context -- the natural reading is that they may require

9

only the information from the applicant that's necessary

10

So the language here, I think any

essentially to shift the burden.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

Where you're going

12

is this, as I heard you before:

13

no specific language saying the State can't do this, can't

14

add things.

15

citizenship in a particular way on the form.

16

the point of that be if the State could add things?

17

It is true that there is

But it does make a huge point approving
What would

So we must look back to the purpose, not

18

necessarily exclusively the language, of deciding what

19

that particular provision be, in particularly one as you

20

quote adding to, what could it have been?

21

legislative history in my view is helpful because it

22

makes clear, for example, in at least one place that

23

Congress did think they shouldn't add a provision that

24

allows the State to do just what it's doing here because

25

that wouldn't be consistent with the purpose of the Act.

4

MS. MILLETT:

I would just like to add to

5

them, Justice Breyer, two points, and that is with

6

respect to citizenship in particular, not only does the

7

statute, the NVRA flag it, but the Help America Vote Act

8

in 2002.

9

So even if you don't want to go just with

10

the legislative history, Justice Scalia, in 2002

11

Congress revisited the citizenship requirement for the

12

Federal form and it added a box that you have to check

13

that you are a citizen -- that you are a citizen.

14

Congress revisited this issue after the statute had been

15

in effect for nine years.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Ms. Millett, I want to

give up -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ms. Millett, is

19

there -- I take it under your theory what the EAC

20

allowed Louisiana to do was wrong.

21

So

MS. MILLETT:

It's unclear.

It's a little

22

different in that context, in two ways.

First of all,

23

the Commission made the decision so they have that.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, I know.

25

assuming that, and I'm saying they were wrong.

MS. MILLETT:

Oh, I'm sorry.

And then the

2

second thing is the information that's required there is

3

information, for the most part, that is -- that the Help

4

America Vote Act allows States to require of

5

individuals.

6

an either do it at the polls or do it in the

7

registration.

8
9

Now, in the Help America to Vote Act, it's

Maybe the Commission thought it could
forward it, but at least there you have two profound

10

differences and that is it's at least information that a

11

separate statute has said States can require from

12

individuals.

you're telling us that there are some additional things.

No, it's not proof of

12

proof.

13

this form, it's simply a question of how it's proved.

14

But the Help America -- just to get right to your

15

question -- there's two aspects to the Help America Vote

16

Act that change this form a little bit.

17

It's simply disagreeing about

So it's not as though citizenship is left off

When you go through those instructions, what

18

you will see -- here's what those State-specific

19

instructions are:

20

in an ID number that is required by the Help America

22

on the form because another statute requires it.

23

then you put on -- it says to put on party

24

identification for the States that have it.

saying if it's not doing a very good job, I'd be -- I'd

question whether or not the fact that the EAC is going

anything else they want, and that is utterly

irreconcilable to Congress's findings and the entire

How can that be?

Well, there is two responses.

24

One, it's an open question whether what -- whether the

25

State form, for purposes of Federal elections, can add

Official
Page 46

1

new requirements, but we haven't challenged it, we

2

haven't challenged here and I think it's --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

What statutory provision

4

would you challenge that under?

There's -- there's a

5

provision under the statute, the numbers are complicated

6

and I don't have it on the tip of my tongue, it says

7

what the State form must do and I didn't see anything in

8

that that would -- that would preclude their requiring

9

this additional proof.

10

MS. MILLETT:

11

actually a very complicated question.

12

clear, there is statutory language, I think, going both

13

ways on this question.

14

the State form has to meet the criteria of 7(b), but

15

then -- and then there is in 5(a)(6), which says, if

16

you're going to be handing it out as your public office,

17

it's the public agencies that have to provide the form,

18

it has to be equivalent.

19

I think -- I think it's
And so to be

There is in 4(a)(2), which says

But then in Section 2 -- I'm sorry to throw

20

all these numbers, but I'm just trying to show you how

21

it's complicated.

22

the Federal form is that it's in -- it's in addition to

whatever the States are already doing --

25

In Section 2, the very background for

provisions and -- all right.

Let's assume for the sake

of argument that Arizona could do this on its own form.

crazy system.

creating two different tax returns with different --

how much you pay would depend on which particular form

9

you happened to pick up and submit.

10

This is like the -- you know, the IRS

MS. MILLETT:

No, not -- not in this sense.

First of all, it would be very respectful of the States

But Congress has made clear that there is this

It has to be

It has to be handed out at the relevant

19

public agencies, and the mail form is available to be

20

handed out or online for people to find.

21

could it be different -- it's an open question whether

22

that's what Congress wanted for Federal elections or not

23

or whether --

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
different forms.

And so yes,

It's not just

You'd have different voter rolls then,

MS. MILLETT:

As -- as of now, Arizona is

doing it as a unitary system.

out the State form necessarily satisfies the requirement

of the Federal form.

Because anyone who fills

19

MS. MILLETT:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can satisfy the

21

Federal form, so you're on the Federal list, but not

22

satisfy the State form, so you're not on the State list.

23

MS. MILLETT:

It doesn't work the other way

24

at least for State elections.

For Federal -- for

25

Federal elections, it has to be the same.

Alderson Reporting Company

And so for

Official
Page 49

1

Federal elections, there's a single roll.

It's up to

2

States to decide how they want to deal with the State

3

form.

4

about half of the States in 1993, including Arizona, had

5

a postcard form where you just attested to citizenship

6

under oath.

At the time the Congress enacted this statute,

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The Court of Appeals said

8

that there's a different preemption test under -- for

9

this law under this Constitutional provision than there

10

is under the Supremacy Clause.

11

ignores the proposition that the State has a very strong

12

and vital interest in the integrity of its elections,

13

even when those, and perhaps especially when those are

14

elections of Federal officials.

15

Ninth Circuit's new test did not give sufficient weight

16

to that interest.

17

MS. MILLETT:

It seems to me that that

22

question of whether there should be a different test, I

23

don't think it matters on the outcome in this case

24

because the preemption is in those 31,550 people who

25

couldn't register.

It had both conflict language and

But to get directly to your

Alderson Reporting Company

But, I think the Election Clause is going to

be very different in this sense -- in two critical

senses.

4

an authority in the States that is conferred by the

5

Constitution itself.

And that is that the Elections Clause involves

6

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MS. MILLETT:

9

Please.

It -- it has no reserve power

that's being protected there, and by the very nature of

10

the Election Clause is that Congress only acts when it

11

means to displace or change what the States are doing.

12

And so the necessity of having a presumption makes no

13

sense in this context, particularly when you're talking

14

again about a Federal form for Federal elections of

15

Federal officials by Federal voters who need a direct

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Srinivasan, the problem

24

that I have with that is that the provision you're

that the commission "shall" require the information

2

necessary to enable the appropriate State election

official to assess eligibility, but it simply says that

conceivable that Congress intended that the Commission

enable the appropriate State election official to assess

I grant you that the statute says "may

When -- when the commission fails to do

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But I think the whole point

13

of this, Justice Scalia -- and this is where I started,

14

with all due respect -- is to come forward with a

15

Federal form that streamlines the process of

16

registration for applicants.

resulted were one in which the Federal form served very

18

little purpose other than to set a floor, but then each

19

of the 50 States could superimpose whatever additional

requirements they wanted to, I think that would largely

defeat the entire purpose of the Federal form.

I do think that that's what

12

Congress contemplated was necessary, but it's not to the

13

exclusion of this, which is that if a State comes

14

forward to the EAC, which is a body that's charged with

15

responsibility for defining the contents of the Federal

16

form, and says we think something more is necessary.

Take a look at what we want to submit to you, and you

18

should amend the Federal form, or you should at least

19

amend our State-specific portion of the Federal form to

include this requirement in it, the EAC could make that

determination.

Congress made that responsibility --

General Horne told us that -- that the State did ask the

25

Commission, but the Commission had only two members; the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

So how could they get court review of an agency decision

3

that was never made?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

4

Only the legal director.

No, Justice -- Justice

5

Ginsburg, to be clear, I don't -- I don't think General

6

Horne will disagree with this, the executive director

7

initially responded to the request by rejecting it, but

8

it did go to the full Commission, and at that point,

9

there was a fully-constituted Commission.

10

The

Commission divided by a vote of 2-2.

11

And so in that instance, the Commission took

12

no action.

But a 2-2 vote is a -- qualifies as a

13

rejection.

And that is something that could --

14

potentially could have been the subject of judicial

15

review.

16

Federal defenses, but --

17

Now, I'm obviously not going to give away any

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

And since you believe

18

that "may require only" means "shall require only," in

19

judicial review, the determination before the -- the Court

20

would be whether indeed this information is necessary to

21

enable the State to assess the qualifications, right?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, that --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the district court here

24

certainly thought that was necessary.

25

to be in -- in bad shape -- the government is going to

Alderson Reporting Company

So you're going

Official

1

be -- the next time somebody does challenge the

2

Commission determination in court under the

3

Administrative Procedure Act.

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I mean, obviously, I'd

5

respectfully disagree with that.

6

perfectly good shape.

7

that this -- requiring a statement under penalty of

8

perjury is the traditional way in which States enforce

9

their qualifications.

10

I think we'll be in

And I think part of the reason is

The legislative history shows that Congress

11

understood that that was the traditional way.

12

State seeks to do here is do something over and above

13

the traditional way to enforce qualifications.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16

What the

As -- as Louisiana

has done.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, Louisiana is not --

17

is not citizenship-specific, Your Honor, as Ms. Millett

18

was pointing out --

19
20
21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's certainly

things that were not required on the Federal form.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's correct.

And that

22

was submitted to the EAC, and the EAC approved of it.

23

And I think that's the critical distinction here.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is that

consistent with the statutory purpose to streamline

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 58

registration?

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Because the statute -- the

3

statute seeks to streamline registration, but it's not

4

an objective to the exclusion of all other objectives.

5

And the EAC is charged with balancing the various

6

competing statutory objectives.

7

with respect to the Louisiana submission -- that that one

8

was okay.

9

EAC approved of it; and B, because the specific forms of

And it concluded in –

I do think that's different.

A, because the

10

identification that are outlined in Louisiana addition

11

were exactly those forms of identification that Congress

12

already said was okay at either the registration stage

13

or the voting stage.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You got to stop saying the

15

Commission approved of it.

16

could say the Commission was unable to disapprove of it.

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

2-2 is not approving.

You

Well, I think we are

18

talking about two different things, Justice Scalia.

19

talking about Louisiana.

I'm

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm sorry.

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I was trying to answer the

22

I'm sorry.

Chief Justice's question.

23

In Arizona, it was 2-2.

24

Now, I want to point out one other critical

25

feature of the statute, and General Horne alluded to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 59

1

this and said that there's no way to look in the statute

2

and see a distinction between on one hand what the

3

individuals can be required to provide, and on the other

4

hand what the State can then do with the individual

5

information to crosscheck it.

6

And the statute presupposes that the State

7

can conduct its own investigation to crosscheck the

8

information that the individual supplies.

9

critical provision to see that is at page 19A of the

And maybe the

10

appendix to the government's brief.

11

provision that deals with a different qualification,

12

felony history.

13

States can conduct their own investigation, which makes

14

all the sense in the world.

15

And that's a

But it operates on this assumption that

This one -- this provision that's in

16

subsection (g) at the top of the page, which is 1973

17

gg-6(g), what this does is it tells the United States

18

Attorney's Offices that when there is a Federal

19

conviction of a felony, the U.S. Attorney's Offices are

20

supposed to give written notice of that conviction to

21

the chief State election official.

22

And what's the State -- chief State election

23

official going to do with that?

Well of course, what

24

they're going to do is they're going to take a look at

25

the Federal form, they're going to see what the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 60

1

individual said about their felony history, and they're

2

going to crosscheck it – against the information that

3

they got from the United States Attorney -- to make sure

4

that the information on the form is accurate.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

May I ask you a question

6

that I asked Ms. Millett?

Does the United States think

7

that the Arizona form is illegal?

8

what sense does it make to have a system in which

9

whether or not someone will successfully register

And if it is not,

10

depends on the happenstance of the particular form that

11

the person fills out.

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Here is the sense it would

13

make -- even if -- if Arizona had the authority to add

14

to the Federal requirements on its own State form, the

15

sense it would make is this:

16

always operates as a floor.

17

That the Federal form

It's always there for somebody to use to

18

register, regardless of what the State form might do in

19

addition.

20

assumption -- if I can just briefly finish -- I

21

understand Your Honor's point that there is a practical

22

question about whether that would ever be practical or

23

useful, given that an individual will want to use the

24

State form for State, local and Federal elections, but

25

there is also the -- the well-understood practice of

And that has -- I take Your Honor's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 61

organizations that go out to register individuals to

2

vote.

3
4

And they can use the Federal form, and the
Federal form would suffice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. HORNE:

Thank you, Your Honor, and I'll

10

apologize in advance for talking really quickly.

The --

11

my friend says in discussing Section 7(b)(1) that it

12

would not be rational to require only the signature.

13

But that's exactly what they did.

14

the signature, and 7(b)(1) has nothing to do with that;

15

7(b)(2) requires a signature.

16

do under 7(b)(1) was exactly nothing, zero, which --

17

which emphasizes the point that this is the

18

responsibility of the States, and that's how they

19

understood it.

All they required was

So what the EAC chose to

With respect to the license having -- we

25

license which would be sufficient for this purpose, 100

They admit that we can reject applications

3

by reference to other -- by reference to other

4

documentation, but they try to draw a distinction

5

between that and asking the person to write down the

6

driver's license number.

7

statute that justifies that distinction.

8

criminal history has nothing to do with -- with whether

9

or not there is a distinction with respect to

But there is nothing in the
A reference to

10

citizenship between looking at other documents and

11

asking the person for their driver's license numbers.

12

In both cases, it's something outside of the form and

13

they have admitted we can go outside the form.

14

With respect to legislative history, Your

15

Honor, I think the key thing -- Mr. Justice Breyer, in

16

your question was, it's only in one place.

There are a

17

lot of other places that go the other way.

So we cannot

18

conclude from that one place what the majority of

19

Congress expected.

20

With respect to HAVA, in HAVA, the Congress

21

had another opportunity to expressly state that the

22

State could not look to external evidence and ask for

23

additional evidence, and they chose not to do that.

24

so I would say that HAVA is further evidence that

25

Congress was not choosing to prohibit us from asking for

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official
Page 63

additional information to fulfill our function, if it's

2

necessary, of being sure that the applicant is eligible

3

to vote.

4

With respect to the Siebold case, the court

5

in Siebold specifically said there will be no preemption

6

unless there is a direct conflict and only to the extent

7

of that conflict, and in that connection -- one last

8

sentence, Your Honor -- if there are two plausible

9

interpretations, ordinary principles of Federalism say

10

one should not choose the interpretation that results in

11

preemption, and the same thing applies with respect to

12

the canon of constitutional accordance.

13

Thank you, Your Honor.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
