ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FLAXMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case presents the Court with the

11

question it addressed in Heck versus Humphrey raised in

12

a slightly different context.

13

The context in Heck was of a prisoner whose

14

conviction had been affirmed who was in prison, who had

15

filed a civil rights case that would have had the

16

practical effect of collaterally challenging his

17

criminal conviction.

18

civil rights plaintiff who has prevailed in his criminal

19

case, who was imprisoned for 8-1/2 years fighting the

20

criminal case and comes to Federal court with a Section

21

1983 action saying, I now seek a remedy for my

22

unconstitutional incarceration, and files his lawsuit.

23

The context in this case is of a

The court in Heck held that this action, an

24

action to recover damages for unconstitutional

25

conviction or imprisonment, accrues when the conviction

is set aside.

2

court of appeals to apply and the court of appeals said:

3

We're not going to apply that because we will adopt a

4

categorical rule without any implied exceptions

5

whatsoever that says when you're arrested you have 2

6

years, which is the statute of limitations in 1983 cases

7

in Illinois, to file your claim for damages.

8
9

That's the principle that we asked the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
point.

Mr. Flaxman, one starting

You say that this case should be just like Heck,

10

but in Heck the core problem was the line between 1983

11

and habeas, right?

12
13
14
15
16

MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, that was one view of the

core problem.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But at least this case

involves no such concern about habeas.
MR. FLAXMAN:

That's correct.

In Heck the

17

Court solves the core problem by concluding -- by

18

denying the existence of a cause of action for damages

19

until the criminal case had been resolved in favor of

20

the civil rights claimant, which is the rule, the common

21

law rule for malicious prosecution.

22

that the Court came up with in Heck, which is the

23

solution that the petitioner believes should be applied

24

in this case.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's the solution

But only if, only if the
4


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

challenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if

2

sustained, would necessarily -- and this is the crucial

3

language -- invalidate the criminal conviction.

4

MR. FLAXMAN:

That's what would have

5

happened in this case, as the dissenting judge in the

6

petition for rehearing -

7
8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would necessarily have?

You could have said that ex ante?
MR. FLAXMAN:

Absolutely.

In criminal cases

10

there's discovery and the criminal defendant knows what

11

the prosecution -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't know what other

13

evidence there might have been in the criminal case.

14

ante you can't tell.

15

MR. FLAXMAN:

Ex

You do know because it's

16

disclosed in discovery.

We don't do trial by ambush any

17

more in criminal cases.

The defendant knew that all the

18

evidence against him was the alleged -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but

20

not know that for years later.

21

to bring a prosecution immediately.

22

the day before the statute of limitations runs.

I mean, they don't have

23

MR. FLAXMAN:

24

limitations for murder in Illinois.

25

he did

They can wait until

Well, there is no statute of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, then they can

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wait a long time.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. FLAXMAN:

If he's incarcerated that

4

whole time awaiting the filing of charges, then his

5

cause of action would not have accrued.

6

likely scenario is that he would be arrested -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the more

Well, is that -- I mean,

8

your friend on the other side says that the cause of

9

action would have accrued at the moment at which he was

10

bound over by the decision of an independent magistrate.

11

At that point the false arrest and the incarceration

12

incident to the false arrest is over and if there is

13

ever going to be a claim for what happens next, I gather

14

it'ss going to be a common law action for false

15

imprisonment, and that, I guess, would not accrue until

16

the imprisonment is over.

17

concerned, whatever whatever wrong is done, that wrong

18

is completed at the point at which an independent

19

magistrate takes over.

20

MR. FLAXMAN:

But so far as the arrest is

If the claim was solely

21

directed at the arrest, then Your Honor would be

22

absolutely correct.

23

of action, is not that he was taken off the street

24

without probable cause.

25

is that the respondent police officers exploited that

3

him for 8-1/2 years.

4

5

It's not just the arrest.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's

But all of that occurred,

6

as I -- correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, but I

7

thought all of that occurred prior to -- I don't know

8

what they call it in Illinois, but prior to a bind-over

9

hearing or prior to the point at which the judiciary

10

steps in, breaking the, as it were, the chain of

11

causation between what the police do and the subsequent

12

incarceration.

13
14

MR. FLAXMAN:

Under Malley versus Briggs, it

doesn't break the chain of causation if we adhere -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but just as a factual

16

matter is it correct -- is it correct as a factual

17

matter that the confession that was given was a

18

confession that was given before there was any judicial

19

intervention, before he was brought before a magistrate?

20

MR. FLAXMAN:

That's correct.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MR. FLAXMAN:

Okay.

There was no other evidence

23

presented to the magistrate or that could have been

24

presented to the magistrate other than the confession to

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Flaxman, is your

2

argument limited to that situation, where there is no

3

evidence whatsoever against the criminal defendant other

4

than the illegally seized evidence?

5

in some situations in which there is some additional

6

evidence?

7

MR. FLAXMAN:

Or would it apply

If there's some additional

8

evidence, we could not say was necessarily -- would

9

necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction.

10

would be -- that's not our situation.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

Any additional evidence,

12

even if it would be insufficient to support a

13

conviction, takes -- makes make this -- would make this

14

a different case.

15

MR. FLAXMAN:

I would not say -- well, it

16

would make it a different case.

17

a case where there was a little bit of evidence, but not

18

enough to say there's probable cause to accuse him of a

19

crime, I would say that suppressing or eliminating the

20

confession would necessarily imply the invalidity of any

21

conviction.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if I was arguing in

What, what does necessarily

23

mean?

Does it mean no additional evidence?

Does it

24

mean no additional evidence that is insufficient to

25

support a conviction?

Does it mean no additional
8


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence that would be likely to persuade a trier of

2

fact?

3

MR. FLAXMAN:

What I think it means is that

4

there's no conviction -- what I think it should mean -

5

and I'm not trying to debate the dictionary, what I

6

think it should mean is that if there is no evidence

7

other than after -- that is excluded, to base a

8

prosecution on, as in this case where the man is let go,

9

because there is no evidence to prosecute him, that that

10
11

does imply the invalidity of the conviction.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in this case, let me

12

just me more question on it.

13

there had been a witness who said at about the time when

14

this murder took place, I saw somebody who was between,

15

I would judge as between the age of 15 and 25, average

16

height, average build, running away.

17

your client fits that description.

18

enough to take this case out of the rule that you're

19

arguing for?

20

MR. FLAXMAN:

In this case, suppose

No.

And let's say that
Now would that be

Unless that witness could

21

say and the man who I saw then is the defendant in

that assumption when we start out with the allegation of

exploited it to get the evidence that was used to hold

When the Seventh Circuit talked about there

JUSTICE ALITO:

What does somebody like

10

Mr. Wallace do under your rule if he's in a jurisdiction

11

where there's not a lot of discovery in criminal cases.

12

He isn't going to know until trial whether his cause of

13

action accrued sometime earlier or whether it waited.

14

MR. FLAXMAN:

But he's not going to file his

15

civil rights claim until his criminal case is over,

16

because he knows and his lawyer will tell him, that's

17

going to hurt you in winning the criminal case, and you

18

should be concerned about that.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But he's never going

20

to know, in the case where there's no statute of

21

limitations, he's never going to know when his criminal

22

case is going to be over because he may never know when

23

it's going to start.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what happens if

4

he files a suit after one year and then after one year

5

and 350 days he's prosecuted?

6

then it didn't accrue?

7

MR. FLAXMAN:

His action accrued but

Well, I would suggest that it

8

would be the same as when someone is convicted of

9

battery, and then 10 years later, the victim of the

10

battery dies from the injury caused by the battery.

11

There would be a second prosecution for murder that

12

would not be barred from double jeopardy.

13

that's Diaz versus United States.

14

I think

I think -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So his action

15

accrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out

16

when they bring the prosecution, it should have never

17

have been brought because it never accrued.

18

MR. FLAXMAN:

No, I think he would have two

actions.

He'd have the action for being arrested and

then he'd have the action later when the -- when he was

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENNA RUTH SOLOMON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. SOLOMON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Our submission this morning rests on the

22

proposition that the victim of an unreasonable search or

23

seizure has the right to sue as soon as that Fourth

24

Amendment violation occurs.

25

that claim, it does not matter whether the victim is

4

limitations as soon as his unlawful arrest and detention

5

occurred, and his lawsuit filed some nine years later is

6

time barred.

7

Accordingly, petitioner's Fourth Amendment

The claim accrued -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask, just to get it

8

straight at the beginning, what if the claim includes a

9

Fifth Amendment claim for extorting a conviction and

10

it's mixed up with a Fourth Amendment claim?

11

that claim?

12

MS. SOLOMON:

What about

I believe that the rule for

13

the Fifth Amendment claim, I believe the Court's view in

14

Chavez is that a coerced confession claim has as an

15

element of the claim, the use of that claim at trial.

16

So it would be our view if that is an element of the

17

claim, that that claim would not accrue until trial.

18

A claim -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20
21

What about the beating of

the defendant?
MS. SOLOMON:

Exactly.

A claim for

22

conscience shocking techniques to obtain the confession

23

or the excessive force to obtain the confession, both of

24

those claims, and use of the confession at trial is not

25

an element of those claims, and those claims would
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

accrue at the time of those acts, just like the Fourth

2

Amendment rule that we urge in this case.

3

Only where there is a trial right and use of

4

some evidence at trial, suppression of evidence at

5

trial, something of that order, if the trial right is

6

implicated, that claim would not accrue until at trial.

7

That is different from the Fourth Amendment claim, of

8

course, because -

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Miss Solomon, do I gather

10

from your response to Justice Stevens about the Fifth

11

Amendment claim, that under Chavez it wouldn't accrue

12

until it is used at trial, is this case therefore a

13

pleading slip on petitioner's part?

14

15

confession, then he wouldn't have a statute of

limitations problem?

case, but we did not assert statute of limitations to

Petitioner did file

And for that reason, although the question

18

was presented in the petition, we did not acquiesce in

the Fifth Amendment portion of question 1 of the

20

petition, and the court did not grant the Fifth

21

Amendment claim.

22

sorry -- I do not believe it was a pleading error.

23

is simply that that claim as the litigation developed is

24

not before this Court now, but not through a simple

25

pleading error.

So I do not believe -- a short answer,
It

It is a far more weighty problem than
30
Alderson Reporting Company

that.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if the Fifth Amendment

3

claim were before us, do I understand you to have said

4

before that the Fourth Amendment claim of false arrest

5

would also be subject to litigation as part of the Fifth

6

Amendment claim or under the umbrella of the Fifth

7

Amendment claim, so that the statute would not have run

8

on that?

9

MS. SOLOMON:

I'm sorry.

element of the offense, and those are described in

convenience, why don't we wait for the Fourth Amendment

24

as well?

25

Suppose -- I assume

The two are

If we have to wait for the Fifth Amendment

MS. SOLOMON:

Because the rule of accrual is
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the act -- the claim accrues when the plaintiff

2

experiences an injury.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we're making up the

4

rule of accrual, Ms. Solomon.

5

wait for one, why not wait for the other?

6

MS. SOLOMON:

I'm asking, if we have to

Well, with respect, Justice

7

Kennedy, I don't believe the Court is making up a rule

8

of accrual.

9

Cases like Ricks and Chardon make clear, and the Fourth

I think those rules are quite well settled.

10

Amendment cases make clear that a Fourth Amendment

11

violation, unlike the Fifth, where evidence is used at

12

trial, the Fourth Amendment claim violation is fully

13

accomplished at the time of the illegal search or

14

seizure.

15

Anything JUSTICE SCALIA:

Who is the defendant in a

Fifth Amendment claim?

introduced it at trial, since that is the offense?

25

Amendment claim are very different from the reasons that

And some of those cases are

32
Alderson Reporting Company

But, the reasons

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

dictate the accrual of the Fourth Amendment claim at the

2

time -- the only action the petitioner alleges violated

3

the Fourth Amendment in this case was when his detention

4

at the police station, which was consensual at the

5

outset, became unconsensual, became involuntary at some

6

point before he confessed.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if he had also brought

8

a Fifth Amendment claim, your view as I take it would be

9

as follows:

10

Number one, his Fourth Amendment claim, the

11

running of the statute, the Fourth Amendment claim would

12

be unaffected by that, so that would have to have been

13

brought within the two-year period.

14

MS. SOLOMON:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's correct.
Number two, I'm assuming,

16

and this is what I want you to tell me whether my

17

assumption is right -- I am assuming that if a Fifth

18

Amendment claim were brought by -- no, strike the

19

assumption.

20

You, I take it, would -- let me ask a

21

different question.

I take it you would agree that so

22

long as a criminal case was pending, that it would be

23

sensible and maybe required for the court simply to

24

abstain from any proceedings on the Fourth Amendment

25

claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

He's

going to have to say now, is the kind of claim that's

2

being argued in my court that the policemen did

3

something unconstitutional, if I say that's correct,

4

that the plaintiff wins, I have to go on to say does the

5

correctness of that, there was a violation, mean that

6

the conviction if there is a conviction in the state

7

court later, will necessarily be vitiated.

whether we do it through a set of abstention rules,

15

which we have to have Federal abstention rules or it

16

won't be worked out properly, or we have to have Federal

result here without either having clear abstention

rules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as I

Am I right?

MS. SOLOMON:

If I'm wrong, let me

I think those are essentially

24

the two choices, with one caveat.

We would call it an

25

accrual rule as opposed to a tolling rule, for the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason that this court has always respected the tolling

2

rules that states have whereas accrual is a Federal

3

question.

4

But with that slight caveat, I do believe

5

that those are the two main options.

But I don't

6

believe the Court should be indifferent as between them.

7

There are very serious practical reasons weighing down

8

on our rule, which is a rule of immediate accrual and

9

filing not immediately, of course -- the case need only

10

be filed within the period of the statute of

11

limitations.

12

Thereafter it might well be that some cases,

13

maybe many cases, maybe nearly all cases, would need a

14

stay of some sort while the Federal -- excuse me -

15

while the criminal case is ongoing.

16

But that question, figuring out whether a

17

stay is warranted in order to avoid interference with a

18

ongoing state prosecution, is far easier to figure out

19

than whether the evidence is the only evidence, whether

20

it's critical evidence, whether there was other

21

evidence.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose -- correct me if

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you delay accrual by

which is immediate accrual coupled with a stay of some

advantages.

22

The first is that it does serve the purposes

that all statutes of limitations serve, which is it puts

Is there any remedy that

Illinois law provides for a case like this where a

person spends, what was it, eight years in prison and is

5

evidence to try him in the first place?

6

MS. SOLOMON:

In many cases, the state law
