 (10:03 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

first this morning in Case 13352, B&B Hardware v. 

5

Hargis Industries. 

6

 Mr. Jay. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM JAY 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9
10
11

 MR. JAY: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The Lanham Act contains only one concept of 

12

likelihood of confusion.  That is why the two tribunals 

13

in this case decided the same issue, and that is why 

14

issue of preclusion is appropriate.  Whether a court is 

15

considering registration or infringement or both at the 

16

same time, the statutory test is the same, whether the 

17

resemblance of the marks as used on particular goods 

18

would give rise to a likelihood of confusion or mistake 

19

or deceit. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Jay, there are 

21

exceptions to preclusion even though you would see the 

22

identical issue, and one of them is when the stakes are 

23

higher in the second proceeding than in the first and, 

24

indeed, the restatement of judgments gives some 

25

examples of that.  And it seems to me this is such a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

case, because it's one thing to say that we won't 

2

register your mark and another to say you can't use the 

3

mark. 

4

 MR. JAY: 

There is an exception for when 

5

when the stakes are different, Justice Ginsburg, but I 

6

think that the difference has to be a difference of an 

7

order of magnitude greater than we're dealing with here. 

8

So I think the best example in the restatement is the 

9

example of a small claims court.  Small claims courts 

10

are set up in such a way that their designers understand 

11

their judgments won't be preclusive and that's what gets 

12

people to litigate there. 

13

 Here the stakes are different, but I don't 

14

think it can be said that the stakes before the 

15

Trademark Trial and Appeal Board are so low. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I don't think that your 

17

example of small claims court is the closest.  There's 

18

one on section 83, which is determinations by an 

19

administrative tribunal, and the example it gives is of 

20

a scheme that contemplates an agency proceeding to be as 

21

expeditious as possible.  And one way of assuring 

22

expeditiousness is to confine the stakes to the matter 

23

immediately in controversy. 

24
25

 MR. JAY: 

The matter immediately in 

controversy, though, in  in this case, the matter is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1
2

the same and the  the way that 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The matter in controversy 

3

is registration, and in the second proceeding, it's 

4

infringement. 

5

 MR. JAY: 

That's correct.  That's why 

6

there's no claim preclusion, for example.  So in that 

7

sense, they are different, but the inquiry that the two 

8

tribunals are asking is the same. 

9

 And to say that the  the stakes are 

10

different, certainly, they're different, but I don't 

11

think that they are sufficiently different that you can 

12

infer from that that Congress wanted the trademark 

13

board's judgments not to be preclusive. 

14

 And I would encourage the Court to think 

15

about the ways in which the trademark board decides 

16

issues that will be, I think everyone would agree, 

17

exactly the same in subsequent litigation such as 

18

priority.  Priority is the key to determining who gets 

19

to register a mark, who's the senior mark, and who's 

20

and who's the junior mark.  The trademark board 

21

frequently decides that factual question, who came 

22

first, who started using it in commerce first.  And 

23

there's no reason to think that Congress would want that 

24

factual matter relitigated in a subsequent infringement 

25

action without regard to the proceeding that's come

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

before. 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I suppose 
Well, just 
I suppose in one sense 

5

the  the trademark determination is broader rather 

6

than narrower than the infringement determination, 

7

right?  The infringement determination just applies to 

8

one alleged infringer whereas the trademark registration 

9

would register the trademark as against the world.  So 

10
11

I'm not sure that it's terribly narrower. 
 MR. JAY: 

Well, in the  in an opposition 

12

or cancellation proceeding, Justice Scalia, there 

13

there is a concrete dispute between the holders of two 

14

marks.  But you're right that a registration is a right 

15

nationwide as against the world that gives you 

16

priority as of a certain date. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But  but the person who 

18

uses the mark could continue to use it.  And the reason 

19

the restatement gives before the expeditious first 

20

proceeding is that you don't want to make that 

21

proceeding pull out all the stops because it's going to 

22

be determinative of the infringement suit. 

23

 MR. JAY: 

But I think you could say the 

24

same, Justice Ginsburg, if the Trademark Trial and 

25

Appeal Board's decision were appealed to a U.S. District

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

Court or to the Federal Circuit.  The stakes would be 

2

the same.  The stakes would still be registration. 

3

 But I don't understand the other side to be 

4

saying that that tribunal's judgment would not be 

5

preclusive because  because of a difference in the 

6

stakes.  They're saying that the issues are different to 

7

be sure.  They're saying that the legal issue of 

8

confuse  of likelihood of confusion in infringement 

9

proceedings is different than the legal issue in 

10
11

registration proceedings. 
 But I think once you get past that argument, 

12

and I think the statute and the history and the 

13

structure all dispatch that, then I think that the  I 

14

don't think that the notion that the stakes are 

15

different can save Respondents from preclusion here. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Would you agree that if we 

17

accept your argument, the number of cases in which the 

18

elements of issue preclusion will be met by the TTAB 

19

proceeding will be relatively rare?  And if that is the 

20

case, is it worthwhile to create a rule that applies 

21

only in that very limited set of circumstances? 

22

 MR. JAY: 

I think, Justice Alito, that the 

23

number of circumstances in which the  our rule would 

24

apply depends on the number of circumstances in which 

25

people seek to register the same goods that they are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

actually using.  Now, it's certainly true that sometimes 

2

people file registrations for goods that they don't 

3

intend to use and that their actual use in real life 

4

will be different. 

5

 But I do think that for the 40some odd 

6

percent of registrations that are  deal with marks 

7

already in use, that generally, when an applicant comes 

8

to the patent office and says, I'd like to register a 

9

trademark for use on these goods, that it's the goods 

10

that that person is already using.  So that under our 

11

rule when the marks are the same, the goods are the 

12

same, and they're sold in the same channels of commerce, 

13

that's when it's appropriate for preclusion to apply. 

14

 And I don't think that that's such a 

15

vanishingly small set of circumstances that you would 

16

say the game isn't worth the candle. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I have a bit of a 

18

problem, okay?  We have held that in  in Kappos last 

19

year or two terms ago  I've now lost track of time 

20

that an applicant who loses before the board can 

21

introduce new evidence at the trial.  So we have made 

22

the assumption that  that an applicant doesn't have to 

23

produce everything.  So what happens in the situation 

24

when there is new evidence?  What kind of deference do 

25

we owe then?  Is it  that's why I think Justice Alito

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

said this might be a unique case because I  then 

2

your adversary may tell me and tell me differently 

3

the two proceedings had almost identical evidence. 

4

 MR. JAY: 

That is certainly our position, 

5

that the proceedings were the same.  The only difference 

6

Respondent has identified is this point about the 

7

twoword phrase, "building fasteners," which I'd be 

8

happy to come back to. 

9

 But I want to make sure I understand Your 

10

Honor's question.  You're asking what the preclusive 

11

effect of a district court's judgment would be if new 

12

evidence is 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No.  Just assume that 

14

there's new evidence that they want to present at the 

15

infringement trial. 

16

 MR. JAY: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Oh, I see. 
So what's the charge 

18

the court gives?  What deference does the court ask to 

19

be given to the board in that situation? 

20

 MR. JAY: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22
23

I think 
It didn't have evidence 

that existed before. 
 MR. JAY: 

Well, I think that there are 

24

there are two different questions.  One is whether the 

25

marks are the same, the goods are the same, and they're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

being sold in the same channels of commerce, and 

2

that's  that is what would line up the infringement 

3

proceeding with the registration proceeding. 

4

 And saying I have new evidence that I would 

5

like to introduce that I didn't introduce before, you 

6

have the option to go up to the district court on review 

7

of the trademark board proceeding.  You always have that 

8

option, and that's what  that is the significance of 

9

Kappos v. Hyatt. 

10

 If you don't take that option, I think you 

11

should not expect in the infringement litigation to say, 

12

well, preclusion doesn't apply merely because I think I 

13

have some new evidence. 

14

 And that's a bedrock principle of the law on 

15

judgments, that new evidence is not enough to get you 

16

right to preclusion, but 

17
18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
the effects of full preclusion. 

19

 MR. JAY: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21
22

So you're talking about 

Well 
If you could have, you 

should have. 
 MR. JAY: 

If you could have, you should 

23

have.  Now, there certainly will be  there certainly 

24

are matters that the trademark board will not 

25

adjudicate, and there certainly are ways in which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

infringement litigation can differ and that the simplest 

2

way is if the goods are different.  So if you seek to 

3

register a broad array of goods and the trademark board 

4

finds a likelihood of confusion based on that broad 

5

array of goods in your registration, but the 

6

infringement action turns only on one  you know, one 

7

good within that set, jeans instead of all clothing, for 

8

example, then I think preclusion wouldn't apply.  And 

9

that's the way the Federal Circuit applies it going in 

10

the opposite direction, that if infringement  if 

11

infringement  that no confusion judgment turns only on 

12

a tiny subset of the goods listed in the registration. 

13

Well, then, of course the issue is different because 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Suppose the  and maybe 

15

this is what is worrying some people.  The marks, you 

16

have a mark, I have a mark, and I have  it's like 

17

Louis Vuitton or something.  I mean, it covers just 

18

thousands of things.  And there is one manufacturer who 

19

makes one of those things, and he really thinks, I don't 

20

have to worry about this, you know.  If  if I win or 

21

lose, it's not that big a deal.  I don't think they're 

22

going to come into my area really. 

23
24
25

 MR. JAY: 

Louis Vuitton thinks this or 

the 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, the  the competitor

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

in one small thing like a lipstick or something, he 

2

doesn't think there is going to be Louis Vuitton 

3

lipstick, though there may be.  And sure enough, it is 

4

there, and sure enough, he does do it, so he just 

5

doesn't want to go to the time and trouble of having 

6

every possible bit of evidence and so forth.  And then 

7

lo and behold, later on it turns out this is a very big 

8

deal to him.  And what he's worried about is that that 

9

means I have to look at every trademark application, I 

10

have to give my all the first time, and if I don't, I'm 

11

stuck.  That's true, isn't it? 

12

 MR. JAY: 

Well, it is true that whichever 

13

forum he goes to first, whether it's the trademark board 

14

or a court considering infringement, yes, he's supposed 

15

to give his all the first time because the judgment can 

16

be preclusive in future litigation. 

17

 But  and I think that the reasons to pay 

18

attention to registration in the circumstances that you 

19

gave are significant ones, because if he just lets Louis 

20

Vuitton sit there in the market with a registration for 

21

5 years, and Louis Vuitton's mark becomes incontestable 

22

then he has to face the consequences of that. 

23

 So I think that people who are already in 

24

the  in the market and see a junior mark holder coming 

25

in and seeking registration, they have reasons to oppose

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

that registration.  But if they don't want to go to the 

2

board, they don't have to go to the board.  No one ever 

3

has to go to the board who doesn't want to, because you 

4

always have the option of pursuing the cancellation 

5

relief or getting a mark cancelled or getting your mark 

6

registered.  You can do that in district court coupled 

7

with an infringement action. 

8
9

 So if you are the senior mark holder, sue 
for infringement and you'll have a jury trial, right. 

10

If you win, then you can get the opposing mark 

11

cancelled, provided that it hasn't become uncontestable. 

12

 That, I think, is a large part of our answer 

13

to the other side's argument about the jury trial right, 

14

that there's always the option to sue.  There's also 

15

always the option to get Article III review of a 

16

judgment of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.  The 

17

board is just deciding a question of public right.  It's 

18

not trenching on the  the role of Article III judges. 

19

But once its renders such a judgment, as a matter of 

20

preclusion law, as a matter of statutory text, its 

21

judgment is preclusive because it's deciding the same 

22

issue and under this Court's decision in Astoria v. 

23

Solimino. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you happen to know what 

proportion of people in the situation that Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

Breyer indicated do go to the board?  And is the board 

2

the  the primary avenue or is it not? 

3

 MR. JAY: 

That's a difficult question, 

4

Justice Kagan.  I know that there are more board 

5

proceedings filed each year, opposition and cancellation 

6

proceedings filed, than there are infringement actions, 

7

you know, trademark actions, filed in the district 

8

courts.  I know, however, that a lot of those don't go 

9

to final judgment, precisely because I think often the 

10

mere filing of an action in the  in the board can 

11

alert the  perhaps the junior mark holder that you're 

12

junior to someone else, you're going to have a problem 

13

if you don't either, A, reach an accommodation; B, limit 

14

yourself geographically; C, choose a different mark. 

15

And I think that the board's proceedings may well be 

16

more conducive to that than litigation.  But in the 

17

there are, I think, fewer than 200 board cases that go 

18

to final judgment each year in contested proceedings. 

19

I'm not sure how many trademark cases actually go to 

20

final judgment. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

When you say "to final 

22

judgment," you mean final judgment before the board or 

23

file judgment after review in the courts? 

24
25

 MR. JAY: 

I mean final judgment before the 

board, Justice Kennedy.  The number of litigants that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

actually go on and seek review, as you would expect, is 

2

smaller.  But there's certainly always the option to 

3

seek review, either before the Federal circuit under the 

4

APA standard of review or in district court.  And if you 

5

go to district court, you can, if you choose, introduce 

6

new evidence. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You have alternatively 

8

argued in your brief for some form of deference if we're 

9

not going to call it preclusive.  It seemed to me that 

10

that was addressing an issue you didn't seek cert on, 

11

which was whether the court below erred in not 

12

permitting the mark holder to  to tell the jury that 

13

the board had found a similarity and confusion.  But I 

14

don't know that you've actually made that argument, 

15

number one.  And number two, on what would you base a 

16

holding of deference?  In what field of law do we say, 

17

give deference and how  what  what's the standard 

18

that we would use? 

19

 MR. JAY: 

The  first, Justice Sotomayor, 

20

let me be clear.  Our primary position is, of course, 

21

preclusion.  And the only reason that we would get into 

22

deference is if preclusion doesn't apply because, even 

23

though it's the same issue, for some reason the 

24

Trademark Board can't render a preclusive judgment, and 

25

we think that that issue is what's not properly been

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

preserved because the other side waived it at the cert 

2

stage. 

3

 But if you got into that, we think that what 

4

you would look  and this is why we put question 2 in 

5

our cert petition and the Court granted both questions, 

6

what you would look to, I think  or, for example, the 

7

arbitration cases like Alexander v. GardnerDenver, in 

8

which this Court decided that an arbitration in a 

9

Title VII action would not be  arbitration would not 

10

be preclusive of a Title VII action.  But the fact that 

11

the same parties had litigated the same discrimination 

12

issue before an arbitrator with, perhaps, the same 

13

evidence was entitled to evidentiary weight and perhaps 

14

if every  if the proceedings were full and fair and 

15

the issues really were the same, perhaps, great weight, 

16

I think, is the final footnote in GardnerDenver and 

17

then in McDonald v. City of West Branch. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Were those in days before 

you could get a jury trial in a Title VII case? 
 MR. JAY: 

The Court, I believe, had not held 

21

that at that point, Justice Ginsburg.  So I think 

22

that's  I think that's correct.  But I don't think 

23

that the jury question has any effect on this because, 

24

you know, for example, there's  there's a jury right 

25

in a 1983 case, there's a jury right in an ADEA case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What disturbed the Eighth 

2

Circuit on that point was that the jury would be 

3

powerfully confused; it has enough to deal with what the 

4

charge in the infringement case is. 

5

 MR. JAY: 

It  it certainly would require 

6

an explanation of what went on, but I think that that 

7

would have been better than instructing the jury, as was 

8

done here, that the two proceedings involved completely 

9

different issues and that the jury should not give it 

10
11
12

any weight at all. 
 If I may at this point, I'd like to reserve 
the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH 
 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 
 SUPPORTING PETITIONER 
 MR. BASH: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

20

 Respondent has not identified any material 

21

difference between the issue decided by the board and 

22

the issue  and what was at issue in the infringement 

23

case.  For that reason 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

Mr. Bash, that's a very much 

stronger statement than your briefs make.  So your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

briefs go likely and probably and this and that.  And 

2

so are all of your likely's and probably's no longer 

3

true?

 MR. BASH: 

Well, the likely's or probably's 

5

were an opening for Respondent to identify a material 

6

difference between the suit and the board proceeding. 

7

The reason we did that is because we were framing the 

8

standard in a slightly different way than it was 

9

proposed below.  And we think if the normal course of 

10

proceedings had happened, Petitioner would have asked 

11

for summary judgment and then Respondent should have 

12

come forward and identified some difference in the goods 

13

or marks or channels of trade, and then the district 

14

court and potentially the jury could have considered 

15

whether that difference was material. 

16

 The issues weren't teed up like that in 

17

the courts below, so we wanted to give Respondent a fair 

18

opportunity to identify a difference between what 

19

happened in the board and what happened before 

20

the court, and Respondent has not identified any 

21

difference that we would consider material under our 

22

standard. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  That's an 

24

even  that's another fudge word, "material."  They 

25

have represented one, which was the use of the mark with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

the word "fastener" or whatever it was that the  that 

2

the Solicitor General's Office referred to earlier, that 

3

Mr. Jay referred to earlier.  So get to the stuff you 

4

think is immaterial. 

5

 MR. BASH: 

So the only difference that 

6

Respondent has identified is what we would characterize 

7

as a different mark, "Sealtite Building Fasteners" 

8

versus "Sealtite."  Now, I think Petitioner has 

9

demonstrated that "Sealtite Building Fasteners" wasn't 

10

even really at issue in the trial, but even putting 

11

aside that factual distinction, the ordinary rule is 

12

just adding a generic term like "building fasteners" 

13

can't make the difference in a preclusion analysis.  So 

14

I think the way it should have worked had everything 

15

gone sort of the correct way is that Petitioner would 

16

have said, hey, the board proceeding gets issue 

17

preclusion in this infringement suit.  I'm suing about 

18

the word "Sealtite," which is, by the way, what the jury 

19

was instructed, not "Sealtite Building Fasteners." 

20

Respondent then could have come forward and said, well, 

21

actually, the mark's a little different now.  It's 

22

"Sealtite Building Fasteners" or "Sealtite Screws" or 

23

"Sealtite Nails." 

24
25

 And at the summary judgment stage, the 
district court would have had to make a judgment about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

whether that was a sufficiently different mark to 

2

obviate issue preclusion.  And the material standard is 

3

not just drawn from thin air.  It's the ordinary 

4

standard in issue preclusion where the question arises 

5

whether the second tribunal is considering a 

6

fundamentally different issue than the first tribunal. 

7

I think in Montana v. United States, when this Court 

8

talked about the changed circumstances principle, it 

9

averted to that principle. 

10

 And it really has to be that way. 

I mean, 

11

just imagine the courttocourt scenario, infringement 

12

court at time one and then infringement court at time 

13

two.  Surely, if Petitioner had obtained a judgment that 

14

the mark "Sealtite" infringes in an infringement court, 

15

Respondent couldn't then just add "Fasteners" and start 

16

the suit all over again and then once Respondent 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, how do you respond 

18

to the question I asked Mr. Jay, that is, as the 

19

Restatement of Judgments says, if one aspect of the 

20

first proceeding is to assure expeditiousness, then 

21

confining the stakes to that issue of registration makes 

22

sense so that the parties will not be induced to dispute 

23

the administrative proceeding in anticipation of its 

24

effect on another proceeding. 

25

 MR. BASH: 

Justice Ginsburg, I think that's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

a correct statement of the law, but it's inapplicable 

2

here.  I think it has two components.  One is how 

3

expedited are the proceedings here?  How close is it to 

4

small court?  The other is what's at stake?  So let me 

5

just take both of those in turn. 

6

 This is not like small claims court or 

7

arbitral court.  This is a proceeding in which you have 

8

the full discovery permitted by the civil rules, in fact 

9

with respect to interrogatories, three times as many 

10

interrogatories as in the civil rules, the full Federal 

11

Rules of Evidence, including Ediscovery.  It's just 

12

like a civil  a civil proceeding.  And, in fact, then 

13

you can 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

There are some 

differences.  There's no live testimony, right. 
 MR. BASH: 

There is  there's no live 

17

testimony, but I don't think that has ever been 

18

understood as the sort of difference between an 

19

administrative tribunal and a judicial proceeding that 

20

could effectively mean that there wasn't a full and fair 

21

opportunity to litigate the question. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

One of the amicus briefs 

23

suggests that this is very, very much less expensive, so 

24

that it's like 10 percent of the cost of an infringement 

25

suit.  Why is that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

 MR. BASH: 

Because in an infringement suit, 

2

the most discoveryintensive aspects, I think, are often 

3

damages and injunctive relief.  In other words, you 

4

really have to look at the other side's books to know 

5

how many of these products did you sell, what were your 

6

profits, and so forth.  So it's not surprising that in a 

7

suit where damages or injunctive relief is at issue, it 

8

could be, you know, four times the cost for discovery 

9

purposes of this kind of suit. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I find it hard to 

11

believe that this board proceeding is  is intended 

12

to  to be expeditious, because the losing party can go 

13

up to the district court and start all over again de 

14

novo. 

15

 MR. BASH: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17
18

Thank you, Justice Scalia. 
How is that expeditious?  I 

don't understand that. 
 MR. BASH: 

I was going to follow on to my 

19

answer to Justice Ginsburg by making that point.  I 

20

mean, you have a full de novo trial in district court if 

21

you want it, and that doesn't reflect the sort of 

22

proceeding that Congress would have thought was summary 

23

in nature.  And I would just add one, I guess, 

24

higherlevel point about the nature of the proceedings, 

25

which is that I think that can come into this case in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

two ways.  One, you could think that Congress would not 

2

have intended these proceedings to get preclusive effect 

3

because of their summary nature and I think that's how 

4

Respondent is using it.  But that  that doesn't work, 

5

because Congress did not set the procedures for the 

6

board.  Section 1123 gives the director authority to set 

7

the procedures. 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's  that's what I 

think you'll hear in a minute, because in the brief, the 

10

red brief, on pages 30 to 31 and 8 and 9, there is 

11

discussion about the evidentiary procedures before the 

12

board.  And the  the Respondent says they are much 

13

more limited.  One, you cannot call live witnesses; two, 

14

the board continuously says that they should not be like 

15

a district court.  They should be far more limited.  So 

16

I guess the argument is, well, in light of that 

17

procedural difference, he can't call all his witnesses, 

18

he can't test the consumer experts of the other side who 

19

say that there is no confusion, and he can't present his 

20

very credible expert who will come up and say, I 

21

interviewed 4,000 consumers and they are totally mixed 

22

up. 

23
24
25

 So  so if you have that  would you 
address that? 
 MR. BASH: 

I will address that.  The only

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

significant difference is no live testimony in front of 

2

the adjudicator.  There is written depositions where the 

3

experts testify, they submit reports, and they can be 

4

crossexamined.  So the only significant difference is 

5

no live testimony in front of the adjudicator.  And as 

6

you know, that is a principle embodied in the APA as 

7

consistent with ordinary administrative action.  The 

8

adjudicator in an administrative tribunal does not need 

9

to hear the witness.  That's embodied in the APA 

10
11

provision cited in the reply brief. 
 The  the other different  purported 

12

differences that Respondent in one of the amicus briefs 

13

have identified are not actual differences.  They're 

14

quoting snippets of TTAB decisions where the board was 

15

perturbed that the parties engaged in excessive 

16

discovery and they said something like, Look, given the 

17

narrowest of what we're  narrowness of what we're 

18

deciding  in one of the cases it was descriptiveness 

19

 you don't need to engage in fullblown discovery. 

20

The rules and numerous TTAB decisions make very clear 

21

that fulllead discovery is allowed. 

22

 The only other, I think, difference or 

23

purported difference identified in one of the amicus 

24

briefs was consumer surveys and the idea that they will 

25

only accept a consumer survey where it has the word on a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

blank card.  That's true  you know, just the word 

2

"Sealtite" on a blank placard.  That's true when what is 

3

sought to be registered is a word mark, not a design 

4

mark with a particular color.  The idea being that you 

5

can't skew the survey by adding colors and things when 

6

actually what you're seeking registration for is just 

7

the word. 

8
9

 But the same thing could happen in an 
infringement court.  If the defendant was sued based on 

10

their registered word mark, I think a factfinder in an 

11

infringement court would say a survey that has design 

12

elements  color, font, and so forth  when you're 

13

asserting the right to use this word in any context, 

14

that sort of survey is not going to be as probative as a 

15

survey that just uses the word, since you're seeking the 

16

right to just use the word. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Bash, could you go back, 

18

I think it was to Justice Alito's question before, and 

19

just talk a little bit about, do you think that this is 

20

an unusual case in that the issues are the same or a 

21

usual case? 

22

 MR. BASH: 

I don't have statistics, so I'm 

23

sort of speaking just from my experience reading 

24

the case law.  But I don't think it's terribly unusual. 

25

I mean, I think a lot of times people seek to register a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

mark for the goods they sell and so an infringement suit 

2

is going to involve the same goods in the channels of 

3

trade those goods are ordinarily sold in.  So I don't 

4

think it's a situation where issue preclusion is not 

5

worth the candle, and in fact, I think it's 

6

extraordinary administrable, in fact, more administrable 

7

than the average just litigation context, because the 

8

limitations in the first action, in other words, what 

9

goods were at issue, what marks are at issue, what the 

10

channels of trade are, are often just set forth right 

11

there in the registration.  So it's not like you have to 

12

conduct a searching inquiry to figure out what was at 

13

issue in the first administrative proceeding.  You look 

14

at the registration.  If no common law rights are at 

15

issue on the opposition side, you look at the opposer's 

16

registration, and you say, okay, this was about cars 

17

sold to retail consumers; that's what was at issue in 

18

the board proceeding.  If now we're talking about cars 

19

sold to government or municipal entities, that is 

20

potentially a materially different issue.  And then you 

21

have to make the sort of materiality judgment that 

22

courts make every day. 

23

 But I guess I just want to close with I 

24

think Respondents' primary textual argument that what is 

25

being considered here are different issues is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

registration provision uses the word  the phrase, "so 

2

resembles" and the infringement provision 1114 uses the 

3

phrase "used in commerce."  I mean, as you can just see 

4

from the text of the provisions, they both are about the 

5

marks being used in commerce and whether the marks used 

6

in commerce would confuse people. 

7

 If I could just finish one sentence. 

The 

8

and in the infringement provision, the phrase "colorable 

9

imitation" is defined, as the reply brief points out, as 

10

"so resembles."  So the textual provisions are precisely 

11

parallel.

 Mr. Katyal. 

14

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL 

15

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

16
17
18

 MR. KATYAL: 

Thank you, counsel. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 Congress designed the Trademark Registry as 

19

a relatively lowcost signaling mechanism to provide 

20

notice, but Congress made clear that the main event, the 

21

conclusive determination of the right to use a mark in 

22

commerce, was reserved for Article III courts with 

23

robust procedures and sweeping remedies. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you do have that 

alternative before  after a board action.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

 MR. KATYAL: 

We certainly do with respect to 

2

district court review.  It's de novo, and that's one 

3

reason, Justice Sotomayor, why we think when we're 

4

analyzing whether Congress intended to adopt a 

5

preclusion doctrine we think the answer to that is no. 

6

That is 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that's my problem, 

8

which is, it seems to me, that you are rendering the 

9

board proceeding almost irrelevant with respect to 

10

litigation.  And it may be when you're seeking de novo 

11

review, but why should we say that you get a second bite 

12

at the apple after you've wasted the board's time?  Why 

13

not just tell you go straight  if you're going to wait 

14

for an infringement action, go there. 

15

 MR. KATYAL: 

Well, I think that Congress did 

16

intend that the district court  the TTAB proceeding 

17

was rendered largely irrelevant when there was district 

18

court de novo review. 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Except that in Kappos, 

20

we explicitly said that some weight should be given to 

21

the board's judgment.  So it's not as if it's being 

22

ignored altogether, right? 

23

 MR. KATYAL: 

Precisely.  But when there's 

24

new evidence, as there was in Kappos, then it is de novo 

25

review.  And this Court in Astoria said when that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

occurs, that when you have a system like that, that's 

2

Congress telegraphing that they didn't intend for 

3

preclusive review to exist.  That is to say, why would 

4

Congress have said that the TTAB decisions over 

5

registration, something that they have absolute 100 

6

percent 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that's not what 

8

happened here.  The court below said, no, you can't give 

9

a jury  you can't describe to this jury what the 

10

trademark board did.  You can't decide whether it was 

11

the same evidence and how much weight to give.  That's 

12

not the path that was followed here. 

13

 MR. KATYAL: 

Well, I disagree, Your Honor. 

14

In this case, the jury was told about the  about the 

15

TTAB determination at several points in the record. 

16

Now, it's true that the district court ultimately said, 

17

look, at the end of the day these are different 

18

questions.  This is what Joint Appendix page 247 says, 

19

that the district court said, after review of all of 

20

this, it was different evidence answering a different 

21

question and fundamentally the different question that 

22

is at issue in TTAB or district court de nova review is 

23

this.  It is  you know, when  they do say the same 

24

concept, likelihood of confusion, but the subject is 

25

very different.  That is, in a registration decision the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

question about what is likely to confuse is a 

2

resemblance where  a confusing resemblance.  Whereas 

3

the question under the statute with respect to 

4

infringement is a confusing use. 

5

 Now, that distinction has 

6

persisted for 150 years, since the year 1870, and I 

7

think you could endorse the type of statutory gymnastics 

8

that my friend from the government does to say, hey, 

9

these are the same inquiry.  But at the end of the day, 

10

that is against everything this Court's precedents 

11

teach, which is that when Congress uses different 

12

statutory formulations in different provisions, they are 

13

deemed to mean different things.  And here, you know, my 

14

friend from the government concluded by saying, well, 

15

you know the statute defines confusing resemblance 

16

excuse me, defines  defines colorable imitation as a 

17

resemblance and so, therefore, the inquiries are somehow 

18

the same.  Absolutely not.  Because what the trademark 

19

infringement statute says, 1114, is not simply that you 

20

need to have a colorable imitation, it's that you need 

21

to have a colorable imitation that in its use causes a 

22

likelihood of confusion.  A colorable imitation alone is 

23

not enough.  You've got to have both the colorable 

24

imitation or resemblance, plus the use of it.  That's 

25

what causes the infringement and that's the heart of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1
2

infringement inquiry 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But, but, but, but.  The 

3

board has to decide whether the trademark as applied to 

4

particular goods is confusing.  Once you say it's as 

5

applied to particular goods in a particular area of 

6

commerce, isn't that the same as saying has used whether 

7

it causes confusion? 

8
9

 MR. KATYAL: 

Not at all, Justice Scalia. 

And you have all of the amici, all the trademark 

10

practitioners before you on behalf of neither party or 

11

on behalf of us telling you that is not what the statute 

12

means or how it's applied.  Why?  Because, yes, it 

13

mentions the word "use" once with respect to in 

14

connection of the goods, but that's only to connect the 

15

fact  the mark to the fact that it is being applied to 

16

certain goods.  Every amici is telling you that the way 

17

in which the TTAB interprets that statute is to say that 

18

the ultimate focus is on the confusing resemblance. 

19

 This case is a perfect illustration of that. 

20

The TTAB here said, look, we're going to look to whether 

21

or not these are the same things.  Basically, are these 

22

bolts or not and not to how in practice it's actually 

23

used.  And that is why 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But even in use what causes 

the confusion will be the resemblance.  I don't care if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

you just add on  tack on "as used."  The problem is 

2

the resemblance between the two marks in every  in 

3

every situation it seems to me. 

4

 MR. KATYAL: 

Justice Scalia, here's our key 

5

point.  It's not simply the resemblance.  It's how the 

6

products are used in practice.  It's how they're 

7

marketed, how they're sold, to whom they're sold.  In 

8

this case, for example, Justice 

9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
the board in this case? 

11

 MR. KATYAL: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

Excuse me? 

 MR. KATYAL: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17

Was it presented to the 

board? 

14

16

Was that presented to 

What's the "it"?  I'm sorry. 
That answer.  How you 

use the mark, the market.  I thought the board did. 
 MR. KATYAL: 

We tried to put some of that 

18

evidence in, Your Honor, but as  as the amici are 

19

saying and, indeed, as the decision in this case 

20

reveals, ultimately, the way the TTAB decides  it 

21

doesn't really weigh actual use very much at the end of 

22

the day.  That is, you can have all the inputs of actual 

23

use that you want into the TTAB process, but the 

24

question the TTAB is answering guided 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You didn't answer my

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1
2

question.  Was all of that  was the same evidence 
 MR. KATYAL: 

Absolutely not.  And so for 

3

let me just  let me respond to what  to the question 

4

that you were asking my friend before, was the evidence 

5

the same.  Absolutely not. 

6

 So in the  in the TTAB proceedings there 

7

were a whopping four depositions introduced and zero 

8

discovery, zero discovery.  In the trial, 14 live 

9

witnesses over a sevenday trial with 4,000 pages of 

10

discovery, this mirrors, as the amici say, the way that 

11

these proceedings generally unfold and here are some of 

12

the differences.  The jury was told  the jury trial 

13

had lots of evidence about customer sophistication. 

14

And  and, indeed, the district court on summarizing 

15

that evidence said  and this is at Joint Appendix 

16

this is Petition Appendix page 37  that that evidence 

17

was overwhelming.  That this was not kind of people 

18

going to Ace Hardware, the customers like that.  This is 

19

a very sophisticated set of customers who knew exactly 

20

the difference between the types of bolts.  Now, 

21

the TTAB 

22
23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And this evidence could not 

have been introduced before the board. 

24

 MR. KATYAL: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We  we tried 
To be sure it was not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

introduced, but could it have been introduced before the 

2

board? 

3

 MR. KATYAL: 

It could only to introduced to 

4

limit the mark and that's what the amici say.  That is 

5

 and this is a technical part of trademark law, but 

6

here's how it works.  Basically, when the TTAB is 

7

examining evidence of actual use, they can use it to 

8

determine whether or not  what the mark means.  So you 

9

can introduce evidence about what is a building 

10

fastener, but you can't introduce that evidence to 

11

somehow limit the meaning of the mark.  So the mark here 

12

is simply the word "Sealtite," that's what Joint 

13

Appendix page 70 says. 

14

 You couldn't in TTAB point to all the amici 

15

who are before you saying that the TTAB couldn't take 

16

actual use evidence and say, well, it's only sold to 

17

this type of consumer or that type of consumer.  That 

18

wouldn't be something that they could do. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Could you do this  I 

20

don't know if you have time  but with an example.  The 

21

reason I'm having a hard time, I'm thinking Louis 

22

Vuitton, say, all right.  Now Lilly Vuitton wants to 

23

register a mark.  Okay.  So we go to the TTAB and it's 

24

for lipstick.  And Lilly says, look it, it says Lilly 

25

Vuitton and Louis says, yeah.  And now the question is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

well, will it cause confusion when used in connection 

2

with the lipstick? 

3

 MR. KATYAL: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
So we look at it.  All 

5

right.  Now we're in the infringement action.  Exact 

6

same situation.  And here they are supposed to say, will 

7

it cause confusion when you  when  will it cause 

8

confusion in connection with the sale of any goods or 

9

services which includes the lipstick?  So I'm having a 

10
11
12

terrible time seeing what the difference is. 
 MR. KATYAL: 

Well, Justice Breyer, the 

difference is exactly what you just said there with 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

I just didn't see it. 

15

 MR. KATYAL: 

It may be what I said, but 

The statute  in the 

16

infringement statute, 1114, mentions use repeatedly, 

17

including advertising, sales, all different ways in 

18

which use causes confusion.  And the ultimate question 

19

that's being asked is:  Does that use, does such use 

20

cause confusion? 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  And it says the same 

22

thing here.  It says does it so resemble a mark as to 

23

cause confusion when used in connection with the goods? 

24
25

 MR. KATYAL: 

Exactly, Justice Breyer.  But 

there it is the mark's resemblance that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

causes confusion.  And to be sure, you can look to the 

2

fact that it's 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4

connection with the goods. 

5

 MR. KATYAL: 

It's the resemblance in 

With the fact that it's goods, 

6

but not how the goods are used, the advertising, the 

7

marketing, the sales.  That's the difference. 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Not how they're used. 

Okay.  So what about saying this then.  We'd say, if it 

10

turns out that in your infringement case that was really 

11

an issue, you know, that was really a big deal in 

12

this  a serious deal in this case, it's not because of 

13

the use of the goods, it's because of the resemblance 

14

through advertising cures it.  Then you don't have 

15

not  not precluded.  You are only precluded in the 

16

case the SG says, which is where everything is really 

17

the same. 

18

 MR. KATYAL: 

We have two answers to that. 

19

The first is as Justice Ginsburg was saying earlier when 

20

the weight of the proceedings has differences at stake, 

21

then preclusion shouldn't apply.  But the second, just 

22

to deal with that, is that if the mark itself claims 

23

some sort of limited sale, limited  limited category 

24

of people to whom it's being sold to in the channels of 

25

trade and the like, then that actual use evidence can

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1
2

come in. 
 The red brief at page 47 gives you a bunch 

3

of cases from the TTAB, as well as the Federal Circuit, 

4

cases like Octocom, cases like Mayer Berkshire, in which 

5

the  in which the TTAB is told it's actually error to 

6

introduce evidence of actual use.  Now, why is it error? 

7

Because if you have a general mark, like the mark 

8

Sealtite, it's not being limited in any way to 

9

particular channels of trade or particular ways in which 

10

it's sold.  If it is 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would the  would the 

12

same rule apply in a de novo review of the board's 

13

actions in a Federal district court? 

14

 MR. KATYAL: 

We do think that it would 

15

apply.  And I don't take my friend on the other side to 

16

be arguing the reverse.  Yes, you could have live 

17

testimony that  that aspect falls out.  But still, the 

18

overall statutory inquiry is about whether the mark has 

19

a confusing resemblance. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And I was going to ask you 

21

in your answer to Justice Scalia in which you've talked 

22

about the narrowness of the issues, you would make the 

23

same comments and  and give us the same instruction 

24

regarding what issues and what evidence is presented in 

25

the district court on de novo review?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

 MR. KATYAL: 

That is why  that our view is 

2

that even if evidence is introduced at the district 

3

court de novo stage, that still doesn't cure the 

4

fundamental problem.  Preclusion shouldn't apply both 

5

because the question being asked is different as well as 

6

the procedures by which they're adjudicated.  For 

7

example, no jury trial in the  in the de novo review 

8

proceeding means that the full panoply of kind of rights 

9

that inhere when this Court  when Article III courts 

10

are asked to decide a longstanding common law tradition 

11

such as the right of infringement. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, the  the 

13

issues are not always different.  Justice Breyer's 

14

lipstick example, I mean, that's sold in a retail 

15

market.  So the question is not  there isn't going to 

16

be a different use from what the TTAB is looking at and 

17

what you want to be able to look at de novo.  But I 

18

gather in your case, you say these building fasteners, 

19

people don't go buy them like they buy lipstick, it's 

20

only more sophisticated general contractors. 

21

 So why isn't that enough of an answer to say 

22

that as a general matter, the TTAB provisions are 

23

preclusive, but if you are showing a different  a 

24

difference in use or a more specialized use or something 

25

other than what the TTAB would have been looking at,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

preclusion doesn't apply.  Which I gather is  is the 

2

way preclusion normally works. 

3

 MR. KATYAL: 

I'd say two things.  Number one 

4

is I don't think that argument is available to the 

5

Petitioner since they hadn't advanced that particular 

6

argument.  And if they did, I think it would run 

7

headlong into the district court's conclusion at page 

8

28A that the evidence here was so different, even giving 

9

all sorts of deference 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I'm more 

11

concerned if the argument is available to you.  I mean, 

12

in other words, you're the one that is asking for the 

13

absence of preclusion.  And it seems to me that you 

14

could prevail on the idea that when the  when the uses 

15

are actually different it's not precluded, but when 

16

they  they are not  when they are the same, it is. 

17

That's the basic preclusion rule. 

18

 MR. KATYAL: 

Well, I think that ultimately, 

19

though, the basic preclusion rule is caveated in two 

20

different ways.  One is the inquiry actually has to be 

21

the same, it has to be an identical inquiry; and the 

22

second is that the procedures and the incentives at 

23

stake, as Justice Ginsburg was saying, have to be the 

24

same as well. 

25

 We think the answer to that  to both of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

those is no.  That is, even when the registration 

2

analysis is looking at evidence of actual use, it is 

3

looking to it for a different purpose.  It's ultimately 

4

asking is the resemblance confusing, not is the actual 

5

use confusing. 

6

 Now, imagine you could have some theoretical 

7

world, some hypothetical in which the TTAB is deciding 

8

the exact same actual use question as in the 

9

infringement action.  The INTA brief at page 20, filed 

10

by the trademark practitioners on behalf of neither 

11

party, says that theoretical world never happens in 

12

reality. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, would you give me an 

14

example of  of a situation in which the use is 

15

confusing but the resemblance is not? 

16

 MR. KATYAL: 

Sure.  So the  the confusing 

17

use is  so suppose that the Trademark Office allows 

18

the regs straying of the word "Sike," SIKE, to put on 

19

shoes.  It's a general standard logo.  It doesn't have 

20

any particular  you know, it doesn't have any 

21

particular marks or anything like that, no stylization. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. KATYAL: 

To be put on shoes? 
Yeah, put on shoes, but it's 

24

just SIKE.  That may be not create a likelihood of 

25

confusion in its generic, broad, just character form,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

but when it is applied at the infringement stage with 

2

the swoosh of Nike and the like, then you could find a 

3

confusing use.  And by contrast 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I'm asking for an 

5

example where there is a confusing use, but not a 

6

confusing resemblance. 

7

 MR. KATYAL: 

That is one, Your Honor, in 

8

which the confusing resemblance  because the confusing 

9

resemblance for registration is decided in a kind of 

10

paper way with usually standard character marks, in 

11

other words, no stylization, no font, no logos 

12
13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Before the board, you are 

talking about. 

14

 MR. KATYAL: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Exactly, before the board. 
Okay, never mind the board. 

16

Doesn't the court that is deciding whether this is an 

17

infringing use, doesn't that court have to decide 

18

whether that use is confusing by reason of the 

19

resemblance? 

20

 MR. KATYAL: 

Not simply  that's our whole 

21

point.  And what I was saying to you earlier, it's not 

22

simply the resemblance that causes infringement.  It is 

23

the use as well.  So if the mark itself is being used in 

24

a generic way, that doesn't  that isn't itself a 

25

confusing 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, it says right here, 

2

"so resembles a mark as to be likely to cause confusion 

3

when used on or in connection with the goods of the 

4

applicant." 

5

 MR. KATYAL: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
So why doesn't Nike say, 

7

look at the Sike mark, look at how it's used.  As it's 

8

used and we use ours with a swish, of course it causes 

9

confusion.  Wouldn't they be free to tell the board 

10

that? 

11

 MR. KATYAL: 

12

that is no.  That is 

Justice Breyer, the answer to 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 MR. KATYAL: 

They can't? 
That is, in the board 

15

proceeding, they can look to evidence of stylization, 

16

the packaging, the way in which it's actually used. 

17

They can look to the good, the fact that it is a shoe, 

18

but they can't go further than that. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

 MR. KATYAL: 

Ah. 
And that's the answer, that's 

21

why all of those cases, Octocom, Mayer/Berkshire, the 

22

New York Football Giants case, all  as well as all the 

23

amici, are saying that's not the way the board works in 

24

practice, and it's guided by the language of the 

25

statute 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

2

 MR. KATYAL: 

Your example 
 because the language of the 

3

statute refers to use being confusing three times with 

4

respect to infringement 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess  I guess I'm just 

6

not understanding what you are saying.  I'm sure it's 

7

me.  But if you put this mark on the sneaker and then 

8

you say, well, is it confusing as it appears on the 

9

sneaker, isn't that exactly what the TTAB is asking? 

10

 MR. KATYAL: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No 
Look, here is this mark. 

12

Here is this good.  Here is this mark on this good.  Is 

13

that confusing? 

14

 MR. KATYAL: 

Justice Kagan, the mark that is 

15

being put on the good in the registration inquiry is the 

16

mark that is being claimed.  "Mark" is a specific term 

17

of art.  It's defined in Section 1127 of the statute to 

18

mean the actual word in the application; here it would 

19

be "Sealtite," in my example it would be "Sike."  It's 

20

not how the mark is used 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So just to make sure 

22

I understand, you are saying the mark is just SIKE 

23

without the swoosh. 

24
25

 MR. KATYAL: 

Exactly, and indeed the PTO 

encourages all registrations to have that kind of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

generic mark in order to facilitate this kind of 

2

lowcost registration notice system that I was talking 

3

about at the outset. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

5

7
8

10

Isn't the swoosh itself a 

mark? 
 MR. KATYAL: 

The swoosh itself may be a 

mark 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So you have introduced 

another mark.  I don't see how your example works. 
 MR. KATYAL: 

Well then, to use the actual 

11

word in  "Sike" in the way that Nike uses it, you 

12

know, with the same kind of stylization, color, logo, 

13

all that kind of stuff.  That is, it's often the case 

14

that registration confusing resemblance is a broader 

15

category of circumstances than confusing use.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

 MR. KATYAL:

that be confusing?

I  I understand you

answer 
 MR. KATYAL: 

It certainly could be a 

confusing use, yes, Justice Kennedy.

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Katyal

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 the  the district

court would hear no additional evidence that the board 

3

oral and written? 

5

 MR. KATYAL: 

No.  The district court in an 

6

infringement action would

8

 MR. KATYAL:

10

 on de novo review. 

 MR. KATYAL: 

On de novo review. 
Right.  In the district court's 

11

de novo review proceeding  and this is what the amici 

12

are saying  it focuses on really the abstract 

13

question, unless  there is one exception to that.  The 

14

exception is if the mark that is being sought  and 

15

this is what I was saying to Justice Kagan  does limit 

16

itself in some way.  So if Sike sought to register a 

17

mark that actually had the colors and the particular 

18

distinctive font of  that Nike uses, then of course 

19

that evidence about actual use could come in.  But when 

20

you're having, as a circumstance like this 

21
22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

keep saying we tried to put it in.  Did you put it in?

 MR. KATYAL:

I  I'm sorry.  You 

We 
The board did recite 

that they were used in a different market, and a lot of

things that suggest they had all the information that 

2

you ultimately put in on trial  at trial. 

3

 MR. KATYAL: 

Justice Sotomayor, there is no 

4

question I think in my mind in this case that they 

5

didn't have the same evidence.  If you look to, for 

6

example, the confused customer sophistication 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

By the way, is there a 

8

record?  I should have looked for it earlier.  Is the 

9

trademark record before us in the joint appendix? 

10
11
12
13
14

 MR. KATYAL: 

I'm not sure if the trademark 

record is.  The trademark opinion ultimately is. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes.  No, no, no.  The 

record that was submitted to the trademark court. 
 MR. KATYAL: 

I'm not sure if the full record 

15

is before you.  We can obviously try and get that to you 

16

if you'd like. 

17

 But let me suggest to you that if you 

18

looked, for example, at customer sophistication, the 

19

district court says the evidence on this is overwhelming 

20

that this is a sophisticated group of consumers as to 

21

which  after  based on lots of live testimony, lots 

22

of different witnesses, whereas the Trademark Board said 

23

the reverse.  They said, ah, it's hard to tell which way 

24

this cuts; there is very limited evidence one way or the 

25

other.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

 Same thing with the words "Sealtite Building 

2

Fastener," which the district court at page 35a said 

3

there was evidence at trial that Sealtite, Hargis, 

4

always used the entire phrase as one thing, "Sealtite 

5

Building Fasteners."  Why is that important?  Because if 

6

you are using "Building Fasteners" in connection with 

7

"Sealtite," you are not going to confuse people who are 

8

buying screws for the aerospace industry or something 

9

like that.  It's limited to building fasteners. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Katyal, if we want to 

11

check up on what you are saying about these limitations, 

12

where would we look?  Where does the board say we don't 

13

look at use in the way that you're saying they don't 

14

look at use? 

15

 MR. KATYAL: 

Let me read to you from the 

16

Octocom decision.  This is  this is from  this is at 

17

page 47 of our brief:  "It was not error for the board 

18

to give no weight to evidence that Octocom modems are 

19

bought by a particular class of purchases.  It would 

20

have been error to do otherwise.  Because the party 

21

seeks an unrestricted registration, such evidence of a 

22

specific class of customers didn't relate to a material 

23

fact" 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You know, I'm doing this 

quickly and on the fly, but isn't that the key phrase,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

"unrestricted application"? 

2

 MR. KATYAL: 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

4

Exactly. 
They sought an unrestricted 

application. 

5

 MR. KATYAL: 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

7

unrestricted application. 

8
9

Exactly. 

 MR. KATYAL: 

And here there is not an 

No, there is, Justice Kagan. 

The application is at page 70.  It is only for the word 

10

"Sealtite."  It is not to a specific class of 

11

purchasers, such as the sophisticated group of consumers 

12

that the district court found so crucial in finding no 

13

infringement. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

16
17

I didn't 
Is that your one case or do 

you have others? 
 MR. KATYAL: 

Sure.  Mayer/Berkshire says the 

18

same thing.  This is at 424 F.3d at 1232:  "A claim of 

19

infringement before the court and likelihood of 

20

confusion before this board are different claims.  In 

21

board proceedings, likelihood of confusion is determined 

22

independent of the context of actual usage.  In an 

23

infringement action, on the other hand, the context of 

24

the use of the mark is relevant." 

25

 It could not be clearer, Justice Kagan.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49

2

That's the way this is done in practice. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Katyal, Justice 

3

Scalia suggested that these are not expeditious 

4

proceedings before the whatever it is, TTAB.  And 

5

what  what is the situation there?  I know it's a lot 

6

less expensive to go to the board than it is to go to a 

7

court, but how rapidly are these processed? 

8
9

 MR. KATYAL: 

I think the amici are before 

you, all of the amici saying that it is a much quicker 

10

process that tracks Congress's intent, which was a 

11

lowcost system that was going to provide notice.  And 

12

if you adopt my friend's argument on the other side, as 

13

all the amici are saying to you, you do incentivize the 

14

Hargises of the world to come forth and in the 

15

registration  they may not seek registration at all 

16

because the cost of doing so, as was suggested in the 

17

first part of the argument, is now going to be so high, 

18

you are stuck for all time  this is, Justice Breyer, 

19

your earlier Louis Vuitton example  you are stuck for 

20

all time with  because you happened to litigate 

21

registration in the TTAB, now be  now it is preclusive 

22

in an infringement action down the road. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I thought you said that the 

24

preclusion analysis would be the same if there were de 

25

novo review in the district court.  So if that's the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

case, then, how can you rely on the nature of the TTAB 

2

proceeding alone? 

3

 MR. KATYAL: 

Well, if the nature 

4

because even in the district court, the process isn't 

5

the same as an infringement in two different respects. 

6

One is, of course, there is no right to a jury trial and 

7

we do think that there are some constitutional doubts 

8

that are engendered by my friend's reading on the other 

9

side.  And second, the question that is being asked in 

10

de novo review is ultimately a different one.  It's 

11

about whether or not the use is confusing, not whether 

12

the resemblance is. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I see all those 

14

points, but do you claim that the district court 

15

proceeding is  is expeditious and for that reason 

16

there would be no preclusion? 

17

 MR. KATYAL: 

No.  We're not saying that 

18

the  at least the district court process does have the 

19

robust Article III and jury protections available to it. 

20

If the jury decides, first, a finding of infringement, 

21

we do think, as our brief points out, that a separate 

22

statute, 1051, would make that pre  not preclusive, 

23

but would simply bar  bar the registration of that 

24

mark. 

25

 And I think that's an important point

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

because Congress here did something, and this is what 

2

our red brief at page 30 says, with respect to 

3

registration decisions, they actually thought through 

4

how is registration going to matter at the infringement 

5

stage?  And they said, look, it's going to give you 

6

certain things.  It's going to give you presumptions of 

7

validity, presumptions of ownership and the like, but 

8

nowhere did they do what, for example, they've done in 

9

the patent statute in 35 U.S.C. 315 and 325 and 

10

affirmatively buy into the preclusion doctrine and 

11

say 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Quick question.  If you are 

13

right about the difference between resembling causing 

14

confusion and using in connection causing confusion, 

15

then if you go to the review procedure and you go into 

16

the full district court, that doesn't preclude either. 

17

 MR. KATYAL: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Exactly. 
So there's no preclusion 

19

whether you go to the district court or not in your 

20

basic statutory view there. 

21

 MR. KATYAL: 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That is correct. 
But it seems to me that, 

23

and I'll check what the experts in this area say in the 

24

amicus briefs, but it seems to me that the fact that 

25

this is a simpler proceeding and that a person concerned

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

about cost would want the simpler proceeding and would 

2

want the preclusion. 

3

 MR. KATYAL: 

Well, Your Honor, sometimes 

4

they may want that once they've already made the 

5

decision to register, so our point is twofold.  First, 

6

people like Hargis may not seek registration in the 

7

first place.  And second, as the amici are saying, if 

8

they do seek registration, then they have to do, Justice 

9

Kennedy, exactly what you're saying, which is litigate 

10

to the hilt and turn that district court de novo review 

11

proceeding into an infringement trial.  And that's 

12

antithetical to what Congress wanted.  Congress wanted a 

13

lowcost system to incentivize people to come in because 

14

it generates positive externalities. 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not sure that I buy 

16

that, because to the extent that someone's not going to 

17

settle and go away or get a sublicense, why should we be 

18

now inviting, instead of a district court proceeding, 

19

inviting an infringement action?  I mean, that will 

20

that's going to be more lengthy no matter what because 

21

then damages and a lot of other things are involved. 

22

 MR. KATYAL: 

Because, Justice Sotomayor, the 

23

registration decision at the end only decides a very 

24

limited thing.  It doesn't decide the right to use the 

25

good.  That's something only infringement does.  That's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

why  that's kind of  it's kind of the main banana is 

2

infringement.  Congress has known that.  That's the way 

3

it's been for hundreds of years.  There isn't going to 

4

be any sidestepping of an infringement inquiry in an 

5

appropriate case.  It's going to happen. 

6

 The question then is: 

Do you want a 

7

litigant like Hargis to be stuck with a limited record 

8

with limited evidence on a limited question, 

9

particularly when, as I was saying to Justice Scalia, 

10

the registration question that's being determined either 

11

in the district court or in the TTAB is generally a 

12

broader one.  It's about the paper mark.  And there's 

13

easier to find likelihood of confusion based on that 

14

paper mark than you can in actuality. 

15

 And so someone like Hargis in which you've 

16

had a jury trial finding, look, no infringement, indeed 

17

they had to  the evidence was so weak on likely to 

18

confusion that they had to manufacture some of it, those 

19

types of rulings will never be able to happen because of 

20

an administrative process, a stripped down process that 

21

didn't ask the right question at the end of the day, 

22

which is, is the use of the product, looking at the 

23

stylization, looking at the way it's done in practice, 

24

looking at the customer sophistication and the like, is 

25

that use actually causing confusion?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

 This case is a perfect illustration of why 

2

you wouldn't want to have a preclusion rule in practice 

3

because there's no infringement at bottom line here when 

4

the product's actual use is being decided.  The only way 

5

you can find a likelihood of confusion is by looking to 

6

something more abstract, the resemblance and the 

7

similarity of the goods alone, only the goods, not the 

8

way in which the goods are actually being manufactured 

9

and being sold. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Katyal, I'm just 

11

looking here at the TTAB's analysis and it seems to me 

12

it's loaded with stuff about use.  It says, "B&B's 

13

sophisticated fasteners are primarily used in sealing 

14

applications while Hargis's products are the next step 

15

up from a nail and are not made for sealing." 

16

 MR. KATYAL: 

Justice Kagan, there's no doubt 

17

that they recite that as part of the facts, but at page 

18

70, they say the determinative factor here is the 

19

similarity of the goods and not the similarity of the 

20

goods in the actual marketplace because as the district 

21

court found, these goods actually don't compete in the 

22

marketplace whatsoever. 

23

 Sure, some evidence is going to come in at 

24

the front end.  Our point, Justice Kagan, is at the back 

25

end, the process that is the question the TTAB is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

deciding ultimately is about confusing resemblance and 

2

that is a lot easier 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Again, it says, "The 

4

products of the parties move in different channels of 

5

trade."  It says, "It's the use of substantially 

6

identical marks on closelyrelated products." 

7

 MR. KATYAL: 

Well, Justice Kagan, our point 

8

is not  our brief acknowledges that, that oftentimes 

9

the TTAB, some evidence of actual use comes in, but it 

10
11

comes in to answer a different question. 
 It's kind of like Montana v. Egelhoff, the 

12

dual intoxication case.  Some evidence about alcohol can 

13

come in for  to determine whether or not someone had 

14

the first degree murder intent.  Other evidence on 

15

intoxication might come in in a different trial to 

16

determine whether or not someone had the physical 

17

ability to pull the trigger.  The evidence comes in in 

18

both cases, but it's asking a different question at the 

19

end of the day.  The resemblance inquiry is abstract 

20

and  and the infringement one is actuality.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. JAY: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 Everything Hargis wanted to put in at the 

2

trademark board it could have put in.  If it had won, it 

3

would have had a valuable protection.  And, Justice 

4

Kennedy, this goes to why litigants would  would seek 

5

preclusion.  It would have been protected against an 

6

infringement action based on the same facts.  And that 

7

is why we think that the Federal Circuit has been for 

8

years affirming the idea that once you've already won in 

9

one tribunal in an infringement action, the trademark 

10

board shouldn't reach a different decision.  The 

11

trademark board should not be registering marks that 

12

infringe, it should not be withholding registration for 

13

marks that don't. 

14

 Let me point  let me be absolutely clear 

15

about what the trademark board can consider.  I must 

16

respectfully disagree with my friend about  about what 

17

he said.  If you want to consider the logo, the board 

18

can consider the logo.  Look at the Toro case about the 

19

mark LawnPup which had a  which was used with a little 

20

dog.  Look at the Federal Circuit's decision in Kenner 

21

which dealt with the mark PlayDoh and which the Federal 

22

Circuit went on and on about the fact that the two 

23

products were used with trade dress that was exactly the 

24

same.  Even though 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

This  remember the case

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

we had where you can trademark a color. 

2

 MR. JAY: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
And it was a peculiar shade 

4

of green and used on dry cleaning pads.  Suppose I want 

5

to do that and I own the trademark, a junior person 

6

comes in and he has a different shade of green.  Okay? 

7

Seems different.  Can I introduce evidence that the 

8

people who use these particular kinds of dry cleaners 

9

are colorblind?  And so they won't recognize the 

10

difference.  It has nothing to do with the use.  It has 

11

only to do with the customers or the conditions in which 

12

they are used.  Can I introduce that at the board or 

13

not? 

14
15

 MR. JAY: 

Let me  I think no, but let me 

contrast with 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MR. JAY: 

No. 
But the reason why  what Hargis 

18

could put in, what it needed to put in, this just goes 

19

to the essential difference.  And this is what Justice 

20

Kagan brought out in her colloquy with my friend.  That 

21

there is a restriction in these registrations.  One is 

22

restricted to aerospace fasteners.  One is restricted to 

23

building fasteners.  And the differences between those 

24

marks, that's what the board took evidence on and 

25

considered.  It didn't just make up what the nature of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

the fastener market was.  It took evidence on it and 

2

that's why at 61A and 64A of the Petition Appendix it 

3

explains it understands that the fastener market is not 

4

monolithic.  It explains that there is not direct 

5

competition, but it understands that there is likely 

6

confusion because if you are looking for a fastener and 

7

you think that, oh, I'll buy a Sealtite fastener, it 

8

must be made by the aerospace people, that's what 

9

that's what they were getting at, and that's evidence 

10

that the board could come in. 

11

 My friend said repeatedly that the evidence 

12

was different between the proceedings.  Respectfully, 

13

that doesn't matter.  Page 52 of our blue brief, Section 

14

27 of the Restatement of Judgments:  New evidence is not 

15

what matters.  The question is were they asking the same 

16

question.  And the Trademark Board could and did take 

17

evidence about the question whether aerospace fasteners 

18

are so different from construction fasteners that, 

19

despite the phonetic identity of the marks, we should 

20

let Hargis use its mark on these different goods.  And 

21

the board said:  We've looked at the differences, but we 

22

find that they are intrinsically related because they're 

23

both fasteners even if different. 

24

 Maybe that was right and maybe that was 

25

wrong.  We, of course, think it was right.  But if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

Hargis thought it was wrong its remedy was to appeal, 

2

not to relitigate. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Katyal suggested that 

4

he read from two cases which suggest some kind of 

5

different standard. 

6

 MR. JAY: 

The difference, Justice Kagan, is 

7

if both cases recite modems as to good, the board 

8

doesn't look beyond that and say, oh, fancy modems and 

9

cheap modems.  But if you recite different goods in your 

10

two registrations, it absolutely does look at the 

11

differences between those goods and that is why there is 

12

preclusion here. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
