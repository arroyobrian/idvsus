ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN


8

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS


9
10
11

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

This case concerns 47 U.S.C., section 253(a)


12

which preempts State laws that prohibit or have the effect


13

of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide


14

telecommunications services. 


15

Now, it's common ground that section 253(a)


16

preempts State laws that keep private firms from the


17

telecommunications market.

18

whether the law also reaches into the structure of State


19

government and invalidating even a State statute that


20

declines to grant the State's political subdivisions the


21

authority to provide telecommunications.


22

The question presented is


In Gregory against Ashcroft, this Court held


23

that Federal statutes should not be construed to intrude


24

on core areas of State sovereignty unless Congress has


25

made its intent to do so clear. 


4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, in our tradition, political subdivisions


2

are creatures of the State and they have the authority and


3

only the authority that the State has granted them.

4

respondents' interpretation, section 253(a) would be a


5

sharp and unprecedented break with that tradition because


6

it would be a grant of power by the Federal Government to


7

political subdivisions of powers that the State, which was


8

hitherto the sole source of their authority --


9

QUESTION:

10

wouldn't be a grant of power.

11

preserve power granted by the State itself.


12

I don't think that's right.

MR. FELDMAN:

Under


It


It would be -- it would


Well, I don't -- I'm not even sure


13

whether that's true.

14

difficulty in construing the statute the way the court of

15

appeals did.

16

subdivisions or some political subdivisions and say you


17

have only the authority that we have given you, and it's


18

not -- other States create political subdivisions and say


19

you have any authority you want except --


20

That actually goes into another


Some States create their political


QUESTION:

The only -- the only thing I question


21

is your statement that the statute itself is a grant of


22

power to a local entity.

23

anybody.

It doesn't grant any power to


The statute doesn't. 


24

MR. FELDMAN:

25

QUESTION:

Well, I think --


It preserves power from being


5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

preempted.


2
3

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, perhaps it's a question of


semantics, but --


4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FELDMAN:

It is. 

-- but -- but the -- but the --


6

the issue here is that in Missouri political subdivisions


7

do not have the authority to provide telecommunications


8

services.

9

that -- that reaches that result is preempted, and


Under the court of appeals' ruling, the statute


10

therefore they do have that authority.

11

would be a sharp break with the tradition that because it


12

would be Congress specifying what the authority of a


13

political subdivision is even when a State has chosen not


14

to give it that authority. 


15

QUESTION:

In any event, that


Is it your view that in all instances


16

we must interpret this statute so that any entity -- that


17

phrase -- does not include a local subdivision of the


18

State?


19

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, because under the Gregory


20

rule, if you -- if the Court were to construe the statute


21

so that it did include political subdivisions, it would be


22

a intrusion into State sovereignty.


23

QUESTION:

It would be under the circumstances


24

of this case.

25

would not intrude on the right of the State to allocate


Are there other circumstances in which it


6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

powers between itself and the localities so that this


2

statute -- so that this interpretation would have an


3

effect in some other instance?


4

MR. FELDMAN:

The other -- I can't imagine cases


5

-- and I'm not aware that any have come up in the cases


6

that have addressed the -- the question presented here --


7

where there are some other restriction that a State has


8

passed that has nothing to do with political subdivisions. 


9

And the question might arise whether a political


10

subdivision could challenge that -- that provision of


11

State law as well as a private party.


12

And -- but, however, since the Court is in the


13

business here of construing the statute and the question


14

is what is the meaning of the word any entity, I think

15

under the Gregory rule, that -- that term has to exclude


16

political subdivisions.

17

think it -- there's no --


18

QUESTION:

And if it excludes it here, I


Mr. Feldman, do we need to apply the


19

clear statement rule of Gregory v. Ashcroft for you to


20

prevail?


21

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it's our understanding --


22

it's our understanding that the rule would apply here.

23

guess the rule applies for the reasons I've already given,


24

which is this is an intrusion on State sovereignty.

25

that were not the case, the question would be whether a


I


If


7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

general term like the term, any entity, is whether that


2

would just naturally be construed to extend so far or


3

whether it wouldn't. 


4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FELDMAN:

Exactly.

And I would say that it raises the


6

question that I was -- the -- the problem that I was


7

referring to before in responding to Justice Stevens,


8

which is State -- the application of 253(a) would depend


9

on the form in which a State chooses to give or not give


10

its power to its political subdivisions.

11

State -- a home rule State where the cities have all the


12

powers except what's expressly denied them, then a State


13

that tried to pull back the power to provide


14

telecommunications -- that would be preempted.

15

State --


16
17

QUESTION:

If it was a


In another


Are those home rule States


established in that fashion by the State constitutions?


18

MR. FELDMAN:

19

QUESTION:

I think so sometimes. 


In which case the language of section


20

253(a) which says no State or local statute or regulation


21

or other State or local legal requirement may prohibit or


22

have the effect of prohibiting.

23

would reach a constitutional question. 


24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

I'm not sure that -- that


It would at least be a difficult


question to try to figure out whether there is still


8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

something that prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting


2

rather than something which just never granted the


3

authority before.

4

subdivision of a State that's a special purpose water


5

district or fire prevention district that just doesn't


6

have the authority, was never intended to have the


7

authority, and nothing in State law suggests that it


8

should have the authority to provide telecommunications. 


9

It would be hard to find something that should be


10
11

You could consider a political


preempted in that case.

QUESTION:

Suppose you didn't give that very


12

broad meaning to any entity, but you included State


13

entities that had been in the business and were otherwise


14

authorized by State law to go into this business and then

15

the State changes its law and without having a section (b)


16

requirement, because you have loads of power under section


17

(b), so we assume the entity meets section (b)'s test, but


18

it passes another law which says, by the way, the


19

municipality can't go into it.

20

So -- so we're not -- we're -- we're talking about only


21

entities that have proved themselves fit, willing, and


22

able to offer the -- the -- to offer the business. 


23

MR. FELDMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

And previously they had. 


I -- I don't --


Now, why -- why would that not be


included? 


9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I don't think it -- because I


2

-- I think that there is -- it's very difficult to imagine


3

that Congress intended that the -- the scope of this


4

statute should turn on the exact historical steps --


5

QUESTION:

6

MR. FELDMAN:

7

QUESTION:

No, no.

-- that they once had or --


But what we want -- we want -- we


8

have implicitly there and it would be necessary in the


9

State case but not in the private entity case an entity


10

that is fit, willing, and able.

11

is fit, willing, and able can include a municipality.

12

what this statute is after is the State passing a new law


13

changing the status of an entity that was previously fit,


14

willing, and able. 


15

MR. FELDMAN:

And -- and an entity that

So


But I guess what I was responding


16

to was it's not -- the -- the definition of what a


17

political subdivision is fit, willing, and able to do is


18

something that -- it is a creature of State law.

19

defined by State law, by the State laws that have --


20

QUESTION:

It's


That -- that's correct, but it's


21

defined by State regulatory law in respect to those


22

entities at least that have previously offered the


23

business. 


24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

I think there's actually very few


-- before 1996, I think there were very few -- and I'm not


10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

aware of examples.

There may be a few in the amicus


2

briefs.

3

of these political subdivisions that offered


4

telecommunications services.

5

only arisen --


There are very, very few entities in this country


6

QUESTION:

This is a question that has


You see, in other words, but your


7

argument here is coming down to the difficulty of trying


8

to draw the distinction I'm suggesting.


9

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that -- I think part of my


10

argument is the difficulty of drawing that distinction,


11

but the most important part of it is that this is an


12

intrusion into a State's understanding of its government


13

and what it wants to do with its authority.

14

State --


15

QUESTION:

And where a


If the -- if the statute were clear,


16

if it said public -- it said any entity, public or private


17

-- but you're -- you're making an argument now that seems


18

to say no matter how clear this was, there would still be


19

a vulnerability.


20

MR. FELDMAN:

No.

I don't -- I don't think so. 


21

I think there would be interpretive problems that would


22

arise in the statute if it had said -- specified any


23

public -- any governmental entity or something like that


24

that really would have clearly referred to States and


25

political subdivisions.

QUESTION:

2

MR. FELDMAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, wouldn't -- wouldn't any --

That would have been --


-- any entity, public or private,


wouldn't that do? 


5

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it's likely that that


6

would do.

7

kind of general term without the -- the reference to


8

public or private or without specific references to State


9

governments and political subdivisions.

The problem here is that any entity is just the


It's just the


10

kind of general term that this Court referred to in Raygor


11

and said that where there's a clear statement rule, that


12

kind of general term is not sufficient to overcome it. 


13

And here, there's nothing in the statute that suggests


14

that Congress thought about, considered, and intended to

15

put into question the issue of State sovereignty that


16

would be -- that -- the intrusion on State sovereignty


17

that would be raised by construing 253(a) the way the


18

court of appeals did. 


19

Beyond the statute itself, in the legislative


20

history there's -- there is a -- the committee report


21

repeatedly refers to the private sector deployment of


22

advanced telecommunications as what the bill is designed


23

to achieve.

24

cited in, I think, Southwestern Bell's reply brief -- show


25

also people consistently referring to the private sector


Not only that, the floor debates -- they're


12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

development of advanced telecommunications.


2

QUESTION:

May I ask you --


3

QUESTION:

Isn't it also the case --


4

QUESTION:

May I ask you this one more sort of


5

general question?

6

the statute as an anti-monopoly statute.

7

grant any exclusive privilege.

8

that's really what it does.

9

were the purpose, why wouldn't they write it that way that


As I understand your theory, you read

No State shall


Isn't that -- you say


And my question is if that


10

no State shall grant a monopoly or grant exclusive


11

privilege?


12

MR. FELDMAN:

It actually is broader than that. 


13

There is another provision which says -- I don't remember


14

the number -- which says that there can't be exclusive

15

franchises.

16

would by terms give an exclusive franchise or keep a


17

particular company out of the telecommunications business,


18

but also that would have the effect of doing that by


19

imposing high taxes on one category of -- of participants


20

rather than on another category.

21

in fact, in the Texas case that came before this, the


22

Federal Communications Commission found a couple of


23

provisions of Texas law preempted because they did just


24

that.


25

This is intended to get at laws not only that


There -- there's the --


And the statute was designed -- it is an anti-


13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

monopoly law, but it is a little bit broader than just


2

granting exclusive franchises.

3

at one -- one company or one class of company or the


4

incumbent telephone company over other new entrants into


5

the field.


6

It's also favoring one --


Respondents cite the -- Lead-Deadwood case as


7

the closest that they can come to this, and I'd just like


8

to point out that that case has a dramatically different


9

question than the one here.

In that case, there was no


10

question of the Federal Government giving authority to


11

local -- to political subdivisions that the State itself


12

had not -- had not given.

13

to this case if, for example, the State there had said we


14

don't want our political subdivisions to be providing

15

education because we do that at the State level, and then


16

the political subdivision had taken the Federal money that


17

was at issue there and said we want to open up a local


18

university or something.

19

presented the question that's presented here of an


20

intrusion of that sort on State sovereignty, but that


21

wasn't before the Court there and therefore the Court


22

didn't apply a clear statement rule.


23
24
25

QUESTION:

That case would be much closer


At least that would have

Commission's position is if, under State law, it's treated


11

13

wouldn't be -- it would still be an entity.

14

-- if it's treated under State law as a private company.

15

In this case, the FCC looked at Missouri law and


16

determined, I think, correctly -- it hasn't been


17

challenged here -- that this is simply a law that prevents


18

political subdivisions as political subdivisions from


19

providing telecommunications services, and therefore,


20

since it's really operating on the political subdivision


21

itself and not on some other corporation, it's not


22

preempted.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MOLTENI


2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER NIXON


3
4

MR. MOLTENI:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please


the Court:


5

The Eighth Circuit interprets entity to include


6

political subdivisions of the States, and that would mean


7

that Congress has -- it would have the effect of Congress


8

giving Missouri's political subdivisions authority that


9

the -- the very State that created them has withheld.

And


10

that would intrude drastically on the structure of State


11

government. 


12

A general language term like entity is too broad


13

to meet the Gregory test because it doesn't clearly and


14

unmistakably include State subdivisions.

15

general term entity, without a contextual compass, as it


16

appears in 253(a), satisfies the clear and unmistakable


17

test, then clear and unmistakable really has little


18

meaning.


19

If -- if the


But that standard is important to the States


20

because it gives the States some notice and opportunity to


21

react to proposed legislation that may intrude on State


22

sovereignty, and it requires Congress to be clear in the


23

wording that it uses and to demonstrate cognizance of the


24

impact of legislation on State sovereignty.


25

QUESTION:

Why isn't any entity clear?

I mean,

MR. MOLTENI:

Justice Scalia, there are no magic


words, and we're not asserting that there are magic words


10

that need to be there.

11

within the statute that -- that demonstrates that Congress


12

was cognizant it intended to intrude on State government. 


13

There are other instances -- and I think Southwestern


14

Bell's brief does a nice job pointing out that entity is

15

used 600-and-some times in various statutes.

16

multiple times even in the Telecommunications Act,


17

oftentimes with a modifier, sometimes without, and


18

oftentimes with a definition, and sometimes the definition

is one -- it includes just a business context, and

sometimes the definition is one that includes government

12

the dissent that -- that you wrote affirms some of the


13

principles that -- that we've cited in our brief regarding


14

Hunter and -- and the City of Trenton case that the States

15

control the -- the creations that they have, that they've


16

made, all their political subdivisions, and -- and that is


17

-- is something that this Court has always honored.


18

QUESTION:

You're saying that it's one thing for


19

the Federal Government to supersede State regulation


20

substantively, but another thing to say -- to tell the


21

State not only do we do that, but we're going to change


22

the relationship you have with your local subdivisions.


23
24
25

MR. MOLTENI:
Justice.

That's exactly right, Mr. Chief


That's exactly right.

QUESTION:

Suppose they -- they did -- is it

2

totally Ashcroft you're relying on?

Gregory v. Ashcroft?


The -- suppose you looked at the statute as


3

saying it doesn't prohibit States from enacting all kinds


4

of laws that have the effect of prohibiting people to


5

enter the business.

6

them without money to do it.

7

specific laws aimed at saying you can't enter.

8

it's aimed at specific laws saying you can't enter this


9

business, then couldn't you say where a State's entity


10

otherwise would have the authority to enter, then the


11

State cannot pass a law that says in those circumstances


12

you cannot enter telecommunications such as municipality


13

as well as private company? 


14

Tax laws, for example, might leave

It's only talking about

And if


Now, what's wrong with that interpretation?

15

What I'm doing is I'm trying to deal with what I thought


16

of myself and they confirm is the major objection that


17

this can't be administered once we start down the path I'm


18

just starting down.


19

MR. MOLTENI:

Justice Breyer, I think it would


20

create an anomalous situation where if a State's political


21

subdivisions had been providing telecommunications prior


22

to 1996, they would be treated differently under the --


23

under 253(a).


24
25

QUESTION:

No, no.

It would be -- the question


would be whether they had the authority to do it.

If they


19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

had the authority to do it, then the State -- what it


2

could not do is it could not pass a law which aims at


3

primarily -- aims at primarily their authority to enter


4

telecommunications.

5

things including removing authority as long as it were


6

general, and then there would be middle cases where the


7

authority, you see, is --


8

They could do all kinds of other


MR. MOLTENI:

But I -- I still think, Justice


9

Breyer, that what that does is it make -- it divides the


10

States into two categories and makes the Federal statute


11

treat the States in two different ways so that if a State


12

had granted authority prior to 1996, the -- they -- they


13

may never -- that State is never allowed to change its


14

mind about --


15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MOLTENI:

17
18

It's a one-way ratchet.

-- about the scope of authority


that it grants its own political subdivisions.

QUESTION:

I -- I suppose it would also allow


19

States to adopt a -- a system of chartering corporations


20

which charters the corporations according to various


21

categories, mining, manufacturing, and it just does not


22

happen to name the category of telecommunications.

23

that would not be touched by -- by this type of an


24

interpretation enabling the State to create a monopoly --


25

well, to -- to exclude any -- any telecommunication


And

company.

MR. MOLTENI:

Justice Scalia, I believe that I


3

agree with you, although I think the more and more we talk


4

about what States authorize and don't authorize their


5

political subdivisions do -- to do, the more and more that


6

becomes really the -- a State issue and -- and really what


7

I -- what I would call an intramural issue that would --


8

that would be a matter litigated between the States and


9

their political subdivisions at the State court level. 


10

And what -- what I really think this case is about is an


11

application of 253(a) that, because of the general


12

language that -- that Congress used, won't be presumed and


13

cannot meet the clear and unmistakable standard in Gregory


14

to -- to allow or at least have the effect of -- of


15

Congress' intruding into the structure of State


16

government. 


17

QUESTION:

So suppose that a State says that no


18

political subdivision in this State shall have the


19

telecommunications facility that does interactive


20

television unless the carrier that it contracts with pays


21

the city a fee of $1 million.

22

MR. MOLTENI:

23

QUESTION:

Could the State do that?


I believe --


And you'd say -- in other words, it's


24

conditioning the ability of its subdivisions to engage in


25

this by demanding that it extract certain financial


21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

consideration, and suppose that this is prohibitive.


2

MR. MOLTENI:

If -- if the State were addressing


3

that in terms -- through the private sector, I don't think


4

there would be -- I'm not sure I understand exactly where


5

your question is going, Justice Kennedy.

6

-- the State can't create barriers to entry to private


7

sector competitors.


8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MOLTENI:

But the -- could


Well, suppose -- suppose --

That's clearly preempted by the


10

Commerce Clause and -- and it's prevented specifically by


11

253(a). 


12

And I think what -- what that derives from, if


13

one looks at the purpose of the Federal Telecommunications


14

Act of 1996 and you look at the -- the history of what was

15

going on, huge swatches of the country were provided


16

service by regional Bell operating companies and they were


17

granted the exclusive franchise in -- in areas.

18

whole purpose of the '96 act was to accelerate private


19

sector deployment and -- and to -- to take these -- these


20

swatches of territory that regional Bell operating


21

companies maintained monopolies on and encourage private


22

sector deployment and people would come in and utilize


23

either those -- the -- the facilities that -- that were


24

provided -- that -- that exist that the regional Bell


25

operating companies had or unbundle network elements or to


And the


22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- to resell and -- and hopefully even the encouragement


2

of -- of building their own facilities base.


3

But that's all -- that all ends up being a red


4

herring discussion in terms of the clear language of


5

253(a) because 253(a) uses those general terms.


6

Now, the FCC's reading of entity won't bar


7

States from entering commercial phone business through


8

their -- through their political subdivisions because the


9

FCC's reading allows that States who want to go into the


10

phone business -- they'll be able to do that.

11

like Missouri that want their political subdivisions


12

focused on core missions will be able to make that choice


13

if this Court allows the FCC's reading.


14
15

QUESTION: 
 Do we know how many States allow
their municipalities to enter this business? 


16

MR. MOLTENI:

17

QUESTION:

How many States allow their own --


Yes.

In other words, you're arguing


18

for a position it's up to the State.

19

municipalities enter or not if they choose.

20

fact, what has happened across the country?


21

But States


MR. MOLTENI:

They can let the

So in -- in


Justice Ginsburg, I -- I do not


22

know that.

23

political subdivisions to -- to enter the commercial phone


24

business and -- and which, like Missouri, have made that


25

choice to have -- made the choice to have their -- their


I have not surveyed which States allow their


23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

political subdivisions focus on their core missions.

Another problem that's created with the


3

respondents' reading of -- of entity is that it literally


4

means the State cannot regulate itself, and that -- that


5

creates an anomaly and -- and it doesn't make a lot of


6

linguistic sense or a lot of public policy sense.


7

The clear and unmistakable standard requires


8

more of Congress than this use of general language and


9

where there is doubt, States are entitled to the benefit


10
11

of that doubt.

If the Court has no further questions, Missouri


12

would respectfully request that the Court reverse the


13

Eighth Circuit and preserve the ability of the State of


14

Missouri to determine the functions of its own political

15

subdivisions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS


19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


20
21
22

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:

Our position in this case is straightforward and


23

I can state it very simply.

24

applies in circumstances where the statutory language is


25

ambiguous.

Gregory against Ashcroft


The Court has said that three times, including


24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

in Gregory itself.

entity, is not ambiguous.

3

Congress had said, for example, any corporation, which


4

might leave some doubt whether Congress meant only private


5

corporations and not municipal corporations.

QUESTION:

9

And the language of 253(a), any

It's not -- it's not as if


But it doesn't mean any fish, for


I mean, there are a lot of things it doesn't


MR. STRAUSS:

I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't -- I


10

guess it doesn't mean any fish, Justice Breyer, but of the


11

-- I think it has a very broad meaning.

12

any entity and --


13

QUESTION:

I think it means


When you -- when you say the statute


14

has to be ambiguous, the Gregory rule as put forth in the

15

opinion is that there has to be a clear statement covering


16

the Federal -- Federal aspect of the thing.

17

to me that that cuts away from the idea it has to be


18

ambiguous.


19

MR. STRAUSS:

And it seems


What the Court -- the Court said


20

in Gregory that the statute has to be ambiguous and it


21

reiterated that in Salinas and more recently in Yeskey.


22

QUESTION:

It depends on what you mean by -- by


23

ambiguous.

24

was -- was employees, wasn't it?


25

MR. STRAUSS:

What -- what -- the -- the language in Gregory


Well, the unambiguous language in


25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Gregory was employee.

The ambiguous language was at the


2

policymaking level.

3

an important point, Justice Scalia.

4

the Court thought it was unambiguous that employee, State


5

employee, included State judges.

6

linguistically to say that State employee includes State


7

judges is more of a stretch than saying any entity


8

includes local governments, but that's what --


In Gregory itself -- it's a -- it's

In Gregory itself,


Now, it seems to me

Of course, you're -- you're into

level.

It was just how far into the


I mean, it -- the whole thing applied to


What about Atascadero?

The -- the language


there was any recipient of Federal assistance.

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes.

Atascadero, Justice Scalia,


19

I think the Court has applied a different, stronger, much


20

stronger, form of a clear statement rule in the State


21

sovereign immunity cases where it has required specificity


22

in the Court's words.


23

QUESTION:

24

-- of clear statement rules.


25

I think there are various levels of


MR. STRAUSS:

Well, I think the -- the best


26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

illustration of that is the contrast between the Court's


2

decision in Raygor and the Court's decision in Jinks which


3

have the advantage of focusing on exactly the same


4

statutory language, any claim asserted in a supplemental


5

jurisdiction statute.

6

that language overrode State sovereign immunity, and the


7

Court said no.

8

language overrode a State's decision to immunize its


9

subdivisions, and the Court said, yes, it did.

10
11

In Raygor, the issue was whether


In Jinks, the question was whether that


The same


language.

Jinks is the case like this.

In fact, Jinks is


12

more of an intrusion because the Congress was taking away


13

a power that the State wanted to confer and the locality


14

wanted to have, and the Court just very unanimously and

15

with no difficulty said Congress can do that with the


16

language, any claim asserted.

Raygor was a State


17

sovereign immunity question.

The Court analyzed it


18

differently.


19

And I think that makes the point that the kind


20

of rigor the Court expected in cases like Atascadero does


21

not apply in Gregory cases.

22

unambiguous, that's the end of the case.


23
24
25

QUESTION:

In Gregory cases, if it's


Does the word, any entity, cover the


State itself?

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes, I think it covers the State

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

itself.

QUESTION:

So if the Governor is about to sign a


3

contract to -- to allow the State to enter into


4

communications facilities and the legislature instructs


5

him not to, that statute is void?


6

MR. STRAUSS:

No, that statute is not void,


7

Justice Kennedy.

8

that situation is exactly the same as if a board of


9

directors of a private corporation decided not to go into


I think that statute -- analytically


10

the telecommunications business and the CEO defied it. 


11

And the solution is the State can say under our neutral


12

principles of corporate governance, the CEO can't do that


13

not because the corporation is not an entity.


14

QUESTION: 
 Why don't neutral principles of

15

corporate governance apply to the relations between the


16

State and its subdivisions?


17

MR. STRAUSS:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

They --


Suppose there's a constitutional


provision. 

MR. STRAUSS:

They absolutely do if they are


21

truly neutral principles.

22

law that says, for example, subdivisions may not engage in


23

any commercial activity and there's no argument that


24

that's just a subterfuge to keep them out of


25

telecommunications, it's a truly neutral provision, States


If it's a provision of State


28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

can absolutely enforce that. 


2

QUESTION:

3

But you say that it can't be made


precise to telecommunications.


4

MR. STRAUSS:

5

QUESTION:

6

That's right.


That was my example in the State


hypothetical, in the first hypothetical. 


7

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, the -- what's -- what's


8

operating there is the general rule that Governors have to


9

do what the State legislature tells them to do.


10

QUESTION:

Well, here it was operating as a


11

general rule that subdivisions have to do what the State


12

tells them to.


13

MR. STRAUSS:

14

QUESTION: 
 I don't see why the general rule

15

applies in one instance and not the other, given your


16

definition of entity.


17

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, when this --


Because in the -- in the case like


18

this one, what the State has done is to enact a specific,


19

targeted rule not competitively neutral -- that issue is,


20

strictly speaking, not before the Court yet -- a targeted


21

rule that keeps an entity out of the telecommunications


22

business.

23

that a private firm is an entity.

24

any entity.

25

And a municipality is an entity in the same way

Congress' language was


That language is simply not --


QUESTION:

Yes, but Raygor had any entity too


29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and we said that was not conclusive there.


2

MR. STRAUSS:

Raygor said any claim.

That's


3

right.

4

case decided in the shadow of State sovereign immunity. 


5

The Court said a constitutional doubt was created by


6

principles of State sovereign immunity. 


7

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.

But Raygor was a


As I -- as I said to Justice Scalia, Jinks


8

interpreted exactly the same language, any claim, to be


9

sufficient to allow Congress to deprive local governments


10
11
12

of an immunity that States wanted to grant them.

QUESTION:

Well, that was not the only


difference. 


13

QUESTION:

14

QUESTION: 
 I mean, there were other factors in

15
16

No.


Jinks besides -- besides just the language, any claim.

QUESTION:

And also the fact that sovereign


17

immunity had never extended -- a State Eleventh Amendment


18

immunity had never -- had never been extended to counties.


19

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, that's of course right, Mr.


20

Chief Justice.

21

take exception with the picture painted by petitioners


22

that what -- our position here would lead to some


23

dramatic, unprecedented intrusion on State authority.


24
25

And in fact, that is the reason I want to


It's actually quite familiar for Federal law to

interfere, quote/unquote, with the relations between State


30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

and local governments.

2

local governments. 


3

QUESTION:

Section 1983 imposes liability on


But those are all under the


4

Fourteenth Amendment where the Thirteenth -- Fourteenth


5

Amendment altered the Federal balance with reference to


6

those.

7

That's not what's involved here.

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, I understand that the


8

Fourteenth Amendment has special significance for purposes


9

of State sovereign immunity.

I've never known the Court


10

to say that the Fourteenth Amendment has special


11

significance for purposes of Gregory against Ashcroft.

12

don't -- I don't think that -- that is a -- a --


13

QUESTION:

I


If -- if for purposes of -- will you


14

assume with me -- and I may be the only one who thinks

15

this.

16

the word any, that there's an implicit scope, and since I


17

think there's an implicit scope, I'm trying to define that


18

scope.

19

help me for you to say, well, it's clear because I don't


20

think it's clear. 


21

But I think when you use words like any entity or


So I don't want to -- I mean, it's not going to


But at that point, I now want to -- to find out


22

whether -- explore what you said that, well, if we did


23

apply this to the States and their municipalities, all we


24

would really be doing is targeting laws. 


25

Now, I did my best to pose some questions along


31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those lines, but I was met with the answer which strikes


2

me as a pretty good answer.

3

what you're suggesting.

4

Justice Scalia suggested one reason it was a nightmare. 


5

And I'd add that in the case of private companies, this


6

statute is designed to give the private company the right


7

to enter or the right to quit.

8

municipal entity, it has the right to enter, but it could


9

never quit.

There's just no way to do


It's going to be a nightmare. 


Once you apply it to a


Now, that would be bizarre.


10

MR. STRAUSS:

11

QUESTION:

No. 


So given the -- the sovereign


12

immunity -- you know, the sovereign -- all -- all the


13

things we've been talking about in general, given the


14

difficulty of drawing a line, which seems virtually

15

impossible or very hard, and given the one-way ratchet I


16

just described, it can't be that Congress intended to


17

include municipal entities within the scope of the word,


18

any entity.

19

to get to the merits.


What -- what is your -- that's -- I'm trying


20

MR. STRAUSS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes.


What's your response to that?

Yes.

I don't agree that there's a


23

one-way ratchet at all, Justice Breyer.

24

the purpose of 253(a) is to eliminate barriers to entry. 


25

It's not to force anyone, private or governmental, to go


I think the --


32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

into the telecommunications business or stay in the


2

telecommunications business.

3

government unit decides of its own accord to enter and


4

then decides of its own accord to leave, it is not


5

prohibited anything.


6

10

QUESTION:

And if a -- if a local


The State -- the State cannot tell it


not to enter.

MR. STRAUSS:

The State cannot tell it not to


enter by a targeted, non-competitively neutral provision. 

QUESTION:

I don't understand.

Why does it


11

matter whether it's targeted or not?

12

counties can enter into the following commercial


13

businesses.

14

telecommunications. 


15

It lists seven or eight.

MR. STRAUSS:

Suppose it lists


It does not list


It -- the reason why it's targeted


16

-- targeted is what I'm using to embrace the notion stated


17

in 253(b) which preserves an enormous realm of regulatory


18

authority to the States.

19

neutral regulations that satisfy certain other criteria. 


20

And that's an important part of this picture because if


21

you had 253(a) in isolation, that would -- that would


22

certainly be draconian.

23

remarkable --


24
25

QUESTION:

States may enact competitively


That would certainly be a -- a


Well, what -- what's your answer to


the hypothetical I give you?

Is that targeted or not?

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, I think that would be -- if


2

it -- if it specified certain commercial activities but


3

not others, I think that would be a difficult question. 


4

The question would be is that a gerrymander --


5

QUESTION:

MR. STRAUSS:

That's why I asked it.

I mean --


Well, the question -- the question


7

would be a 253(b) question for the FTC in the first -- FCC


8

in the first instance.


9

QUESTION:

Well, it had nothing to do with


10

whether it's competitively neutral.

11

neutral.

12

It's competitively


Nobody can enter except these fields.
MR. STRAUSS:

I mean --


If it -- if it were a gerrymander


13

designed to keep -- really just designed to keep entities


14

out of telecommunications, it would be unacceptable.

15

QUESTION:

So we're going to have to get into


16

inquiring into whether State legislatures -- well, of


17

course -- of course, they didn't want it.

18

to keep them out of telecommunications because it said


19

these are the only fields you can get into.


20

MR. STRAUSS:

21

QUESTION:

It was designed


That's -- that --


If your question is whether it was


22

designed to keep them out of telecommunications, the


23

answer is unquestionably yes.


24

MR. STRAUSS:

25

QUESTION:

This -- I agree --


But -- but if you say it's okay if

1

they not only keep them out of telecommunications, but


2

they keep them out of a lot of other stuff as well, does


3

that make it okay?


4

MR. STRAUSS:

This is the question that would


5

have to come up when the FCC applied 253(b) to a public or


6

a private entity --


7

QUESTION:

8

MR. STRAUSS:

9

QUESTION:

But why should we --

-- public or private.


Why should we interpret a statute in


10

that awkward way, that the FCC has to make this kind of


11

factual inquiry in every case?


12

MR. STRAUSS:

I think the FCC is in that


13

business with respect to private entities anyway.

14

State --

QUESTION:

A


What is the -- I don't even


understand what the factual inquiry is.

17

MR. STRAUSS:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. STRAUSS:

What is it --


Well, the inquiry --


-- that the FCC would be looking for?

The inquiry -- it's 253(b).

It


20

says States may enact measures that are competitively


21

neutral and necessary to promote certain public


22

objectives.

23
24
25

That's a savings clause.

QUESTION:

It's not --


So the FCC is going to decide what is


necessary to promote --

MR. STRAUSS:

That's --

QUESTION:

-- Missouri's public objectives?


2

MR. STRAUSS:

That is the business -- that is


3

unquestionably the business Congress put the FCC in with


4

respect to private entities.

5

about that.


6

QUESTION:

There is no disagreement


I see the answer to that part, which


7

is you're saying they have to do it anyway, and I


8

understand that.

9

understand it.


10

Whether -- I'm not sure I agree, but I


What about the part that it's a one-way ratchet? 


11

And there I think that local governments unlike local


12

private businesses act through regulation, at least


13

normally.

14

local requirement or a local regulation, and therefore, a

15

State, State A, that does not permit its municipalities to


16

go into the business, then passes a statute that does


17

permit it, then the local council passes a regulation that


18

says we'll do it, which is now a requirement, and when


19

either tries to repeal either, they run right straight


20

into your -- to this statute forbidding it as you


21

interpret it.

22

ratchet in respect to municipalities, but not a one-way


23

ratchet in respect to private businesses. 


24
25

And so the statute talks about a requirement, a


And now, that's why I say it's a one-way


MR. STRAUSS:

The reason it's not a one-way


ratchet, Justice Breyer, I think turns on the word

local regulations that prohibit the entry.

It simply made a decision.

This isn't -- the statute 253(a) says State and

If a local government decides not to enter the


QUESTION:

But the State could not repeal the


statute.

MR. STRAUSS:

The State could not repeal the


11

statute unless it were part of a competitively neutral


12

reorganization of local government or something like that. 


13

Then it could repeal it, but it couldn't enter a targeted


14

repeal of it without running afoul -- it seems to me

15

without running afoul --


16

QUESTION:

Why -- why would Congress design such


17

a strange system where -- where the municipality can get


18

in and then get out, but the State can't allow the


19

municipality to get in and then decide, no, we want to


20

allow them to get out? 


21

MR. STRAUSS:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. STRAUSS:

I --


It's just bizarre.

I think it applies -- I think for


24

these purposes, municipal corporations and private


25

corporations are simply on a par as, of course, they were

for large parts of our history.

don't have many immunities.

3

purposes, simply saw municipal corporations as another


4

source -- implicitly saw -- and the words, any entity,


5

implicit in that sense, in the -- in the ordinary meaning


6

of those words -- saw them as another source of


7

competition.

9

QUESTION:

That's why municipalities


And Congress, for these


Just so I understand you, a State can


-- can grant certain powers to municipalities, does not


10

have to grant them the power to enter into -- into


11

telecommunications activity.

12

MR. STRAUSS:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Yes.

Right?

Yes, that's right.


It does not have to grant them that


power.

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, the -- the restraint is the


16

competitively neutral language which will ordinarily allow


17

municipalities to say -- the States to say, look, here's


18

what you can do and here's what you can't do --


19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STRAUSS:

Right.

-- provided they aren't acting in


21

a way that is competitively non-neutral with respect to


22

telecommunications.


23

QUESTION:

Right, but -- but once they have let


24

them get into telecommunications, it's -- it's only the


25

municipality that can decide to get out of it.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. STRAUSS:

No.

The State could repeal the


2

authority if it does it, again, in a competitively neutral


3

way.

4

units of local government or if a State decides to say,


5

okay, we are assigning special functions to municipal


6

governments. 


If a State decided, for example, to abolish all

QUESTION:

Okay, but -- but the municipality


8

itself can say we're going to get out of


9

telecommunications.


10

MR. STRAUSS:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes. 


The State cannot say no -- no


municipality shall do telecommunications.


13

MR. STRAUSS:

That's right.

The municipality

can decide for itself because then it's not prohibiting

15

anyone from doing anything.

16

decision. 


17

QUESTION:

It's simply making a


Mr. Strauss, may I go back and ask a


18

variant on Justice Breyer's question, assuming that there


19

is some implicit limitation on -- on the scope of any


20

entity?

21

straight, is the -- is the drafting history in this case,


22

and I'd like you to tell me whether I have got the facts


23

straight because I didn't look them up myself.

24

this out of the briefs.

25

significance is.


And it relates to what, if I have my facts


I just got


And if so, what you think the

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

As I understand it, at least the Senate version


2

of the original bill had a provision in it that


3

affirmative -- expressly provided that any existing


4

utility, whatever its object of service, could go into the


5

telecommunications business.

6

out at one point in your brief, this would be -- this


7

would be good for your argument because a lot of those


8

utilities are municipal utilities.


9

And this, as -- as you point


As I understand it, in the -- in the conference


10

committee, that language was, in fact, removed entirely,


11

and subsequent to its removal in the conference committee


12

report, there were references to any private entity being


13

able to go into the telecommunications business but not


14

the old, pre-conference committee references to -- to any

15

-- any public as well as private entity.


16

That suggests to me, the -- the combination of


17

the drafting change and the conference committee report,


18

that the implicit scope they were getting at was an


19

implicit scope that says any entity is a reference to


20

private, not public.


21
22
23

What -- are my facts straight, and if so, what

-- what's your response to that argument? 

MR. STRAUSS:

Two points, Justice Souter. 


24

First, I think it is common ground that Congress did


25

envision utilities as among the any entities.

And the --


40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

the likely reason Congress didn't spell that out was that


2

it was already included in the notion any entity, and


3

Congress didn't want to begin spelling out specifics and


4

run --

7

QUESTION:

So you say the -- the excision was a


redundancy excision.

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes, that's right.

And I think


8

there is no dispute that not only that utilities are among


9

entities, but that Congress really saw utilities as a


10
11

primary source of -- of competition.

QUESTION:

Okay.

The answer to that I think is


12

in -- in part a response to something in your brief.

13

mentioned that the original House and the original Senate


14

reports were speaking, among others, expressly of -- of

15

public entities.

16

didn't look myself.

17

the briefs.

18

report -- after this excision, which is arguably just a


19

redundancy excision, the conference committee report


20

started using the adjective private entities rather than


21

public entities as being subject to this kind of universal


22

preemption.

23

merely a redundancy excision?


24
25

You


As I understand it -- and again, I

I just got this from -- from one of


As I understand it, the conference committee


Doesn't that nix the theory that it was


MR. STRAUSS:

The conference committee report, I


believe, Justice Souter, used the word private to describe


41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- in describing the sort of competition it believed would


2

be brought about.

3

committee report was then incorporated almost verbatim in


4

the preamble to the statute, but the word private was left


5

out when it was transferred to the statute so that the


6

word private that does occur prominently in the conference


7

committee report -- I agree with that -- dropped out of


8

the statute, which simply talks about encouraging


9

competition.


10

That passage from the conference


QUESTION:

Okay.

What we're left with, it seems


11

to me, is -- is at least -- maybe let's call it tension


12

between the conference committee report and the preamble


13

language which was then inserted.

14

perfect situation to provide -- to -- to apply a Gregory

15

kind of rule, saying when we're not sure what they meant,


16

we want them to spell it out more clearly before we


17

conclude that they, in effect, are -- are limiting the --


18

the power of a -- of a State to determine what its


19

municipalities can do?

20

Gregory rule?


21

MR. STRAUSS:

And isn't that a


Isn't this a good situation for a


I think the ambiguity to which


22

Gregory refers -- I mean, I don't think.

23

it is clear the ambiguities to which Gregory refers is


24

ambiguity in the statutory language.

I mean, I think


I -- I think so too.

MR. STRAUSS:

2

QUESTION:

And --


And -- and maybe what I'm saying is


3

we -- we ought to -- those of us who would look into the


4

-- the legislative history, as I would, maybe ought to


5

take advantage of a slightly broader Gregory rule.


6

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, the -- the case I think that


7

would stand in the way more than any other perhaps --


8

well, many would I think, but the clearest example I can


9

think of is Yeskey where the -- the question in Yeskey


10

whether the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act,


11

applied to inmates of State prisons.

12

that prisons were special and that the Gregory rule


13

applied to legislation that assertedly reached prisons.


14

The Court assumed


The Court also assumed that Congress never

15

specifically contemplated that prison inmates would be


16

covered, and it said, nonetheless, unanimously that if the


17

language -- the language is something like State


18

instrumentalities -- if the language included prisons,


19

Gregory was satisfied.


20

QUESTION:

Isn't the difference, though -- and I


21

-- I see your argument.

22

that case we didn't have anything in the history either of


23

the drafting or of the legislative consideration of the

statute that suggested that there really was an -- an


25

argument each way as -- as to whether they -- they were --
