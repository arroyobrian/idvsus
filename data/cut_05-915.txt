Dowd that when the remedial program has achieved its

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you think that there's

21

something of an anomaly there, that you have a system

22

that is forced on the school, that it doesn't want it,

I won, all right, they didn't go to any race-neutral

20

I'm sorry.

21

As Justice Kennedy pointed out -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Gordon, in responding

22

to Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you have to deal

23

with the fact that this Court said in the second Swann

24

case that the -- that a school district, particularly a

25

school district like Swann which had been in violation,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

had been found in violation, had the same interest after

2

unitary status had been attained in maintaining the

3

unitary status as it had in reaching unitary status

4

beforehand; that if those interests are identical why

5

doesn't it follow that the means to achieve those two

6

interests, unitary status from segregation in one case,

7

preservation of unitary status in the other, are

8

reasonable if they are identical?

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Souter, this

10

Court over and over again has said once a remedial plan

11

is accepted there should be race-neutral alternatives

12

under the narrow and tailored requirement.

13

school board did after I won -

14
15

JUSTICE SOUTER:
for what?

16

What this

Race-neutral alternatives

To accomplish what?
MR. GORDON:

To accomplish the same means.

17

In other words, what they could have done, as

18

Justice Kennedy pointed out, was put more magnet

19

schools, more traditional schools, have more open

20

enrollment.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Gordon, isn't it the

22

case that once you've achieved unitary status, which

23

means that the effects of past intentional

24

discrimination have been eliminated, the only way you

25

can lose unitary status is to discriminate
9

Alderson Reporting Company

1

intentionally?

2
3

Isn't that right?

MR. GORDON:

Certainly.

That's the Dow

case, that says you no longer -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And isn't there a

5

distinction between unitary status and unitary

6

condition?

Unitary condition is a descriptive

7

situation.

It describes a district in which there is,

8

in fact, enough of a racial mix so that there is no

9

credible claim either that there is de facto or de jure

10

segregation; isn't that correct?

11

as unitary, a unitary condition?

12

MR. GORDON:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There is such a thing

Certainly.
And is the preservation of

14

a unitary condition a legitimate or indeed a compelling

15

governmental objective?

16

MR. GORDON:

In Hampton, this -- our Court

17

found that it was unitary status as opposed to unitary

18

condition.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MR. GORDON:

Uh-huh.

If you want to go with unitary

21

condition, then I still think you go back to Brown and

you say has it worked.

in educational outcome solely because you sit black

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Not an improvement exactly,

18

but maybe from the Constitution's point of view.

19

20

cases, to take people who had formerly been slaves and

21

22

society.

Now, the question from a constitutional
point of view that you're being asked is how could that

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Constitution which says that this is intolerable, that

2

segregated school, and insist that the school boards in

3

Swann and elsewhere take the black children and white

4

children and integrate them?

5

the day that that decree is removed tell the school

6

board it cannot make that effort any more, it can't do

7

what it's been doing, and we'll send the children back

8

to their black schools and their white schools?

9

How could the Constitution

That I take it is why the Court in Swann

10

said explicitly that you could use race as a factor in

11

the public schools when the school board so chooses.

12

Now, that's the general question that I think

13

Justice Ginsburg began and Justice Souter was following

14

it up.

15

And I would appreciate your response.
MR. GORDON:

My response is that you have

16

those series of cases that say once you've achieved the

17

unitary status, you know longer get to carve out that

18

exemption to the Fourteenth Amendment, and if we're

19

going to carve out these exemptions to the Fourteenth

20

Amendment, if we're going to say we're going to not

21

apply Gratz where it's a quota system and we are solely,

22

without any type of individual holistic review applied

23

to these kids, then there should be some improvement in

MR. GORDON:

Well, of course this system

3

didn't apply to kindergarten anyhow.

4

it's not.

5

You have to decide.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I can understand an

6

approach to an applicant for an elite school and so you

7

judge it on all these merit factors and other factors.

8

But for a child entering the first grade, I don't

understand this individualized holistic approach.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think if you build into

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the hypo that the only purpose was race and then it was

2

done in a way that made it express that the teachers

3

were going to be moved, that you were basically going to

4

have five and five, you were going to have a quota at

5

the two schools on the basis of race, I would say that

6

that would be unconstitutional.

7

I would think, though, that there are many

8

ways you can accomplish similar objectives without

9

making it so explicit.

And I do think that in this

10

context, I mean, there is an independent constitutional

11

value in not having these kind of express racial

12

classifications drawn.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I understand, and I'm just

14

wondering whether in your view that independent value

15

could ever be trumped by the obvious countervailing

16

value of having some African Americans see some white

17

teachers and vice versa?

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Oh, but I think that's the

19

point, which is that is an important objective, but I

20

have little doubt that that can be accomplished without

21

the kind of five by five quotas.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have doubt -- you have

23

little doubt.

Are you an educational expert?

I mean,

24

the -- it seems to me from what I read, that there is a

25

terrible problem in the country.

The problem is that

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

there are lots and lots of school districts that are

2

becoming more and more segregated in fact, and that

3

school boards all over are struggling with this problem.

4

And if they knew an easy way, they'd do it.

5

So I don't know whether this is exactly the

6

only way to do it or not.

I do know courts are not very

7

good at figuring that out.

school district.

What's your response?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Whatever it takes.

Justice Breyer, if I could

12

be clear, though, what I was saying in response to

Justice Stevens' question was really focused not on the

14

broader problem, but specifically with respect to

15

faculties.

17

have tried to maintain the kind of express quotas in

teaching that he was indicating.

21

an answer.

Just say some.

We want

other.

Constitution permits it.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, let

3

me tell you what I certainly think they could do, which

4

is to say, look, you know, we don't have any balance in

5

these two faculties.

6

going to mix some of them up, we're going to do it in a

7

way that looks at a variety of factors, including who is

8

good with young kids, who is good with older kids.

9

What we're going to do is we're

JUSTICE STEVENS:

My example is 100 percent

10

motive to avoid 100 percent segregation.

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And I think if what they

12

end up doing at the end is not only a hundred percent

motive, but a racial classification, then I think runs

afoul of the Constitution.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Just some, any without

violating the Constitution.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Just to be clear, our

18

answer to the hypothetical a hundred percent motivation,

19

no racial classification, is that it is still okay.

20

Now, some members of the Court may disagree with us on

21

that.

22

that great an import in practice, because although it is

23

easy to come up with the hypothetical that race is the

24

absolute and sole motivating factor, I think in this

context in particular, I mean, nobody -- you know,

hypothetical, that they could achieve a result,

But at the end of the day, the object of

doing this, which Justice Stevens' hypo assumed, and I

ball by saying, oh, we're going to consider these other

criterion that candidly addresses that objective?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, Justice Souter,
One is that the

concern in cases in which the obvious use of race was to

2

hurt or to stigmatize.

3

going on as between black and white, when we say there

4

is a value in mixing them up.

5
6
7

Here, there is stigmatization

Therefore, why should that same concern
about referring to race at all be applied in this case.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Souter, you

8

may have developed that jurisprudence in cases where it

9

was clear there was stigma going on, but you have

10

extended it in Croson and in Adarand across the board.

11

And I have to say -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We have extended it in

13

cases in which benefits were being denied.

14

Justice Stevens' hypothetical, and so far as I know in

15

the kindergarten system in these cases, no educational

16

benefit was being denied.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think choices were

earlier between an educational -- guarantee of some

22

educational opportunity and a choice.

23

And I think you made the distinction

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -

But that is simply another

24

way -- when you say it is the choice that's being

25

denied, and that has to be the focus of the analysis,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that is simply another way of saying you may never use

2

the means of race-conscious distribution to achieve the

3

educational objective.

4

a different way.

5

You're saying the same thing in

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That may be,

6

Justice Souter.

But what I guess I would say is the

7

logic of your argument would certainly require

8

reconsideration of the Gratz case.

9

that context thought that individualized consideration

And this Court in

10

even if it was going to be very difficult in the context

11

of the University of Michigan's 25,000 admissions to the

12

undergraduate program, this Court said individualized

13

consideration was part of the constitutional guarantee.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In Gratz, the

15

characteristics of individuals that could be considered

16

were arguably relevant to a distribution decision.

17

Here, the sole point is not to achieve a quota by

18

relaxing other standards.

19

a value which comes from mixing the races, from

20

distribution.

21

The whole point is to achieve

And, therefore, why is it appropriate to

22

look to other things as opposed to looking at that

23

candidly, if that is a legitimate objective?

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Because I think,

Justice Souter, if you think it is an important value to

The objective is fine.

The

important thing is simply to hide the ball.

16

That's not a degree of integration.

17

effort to try to get the individual schools to mimic the

in your mind, if it really forbids it, no use of race, I

24

Go back to the case where this

society was divided.

That's because the

Here we have a society, black and white, who

5

elect school board members who together have voted to

6

have this form of integration.

7

in society -- which is a good one -- what -- how can the

8

Constitution be interpreted in a way that would require

9

us, the judges, to go in and make them take the black

10

children out of the school?

11
12

Why, given that change

See, my objection to your approach to the
Constitution is primarily a practical one.

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I understand that,

14

Justice Breyer.

15

the lesson of history in this area is that racial

16

classifications are not ones where we should just let

17

local school board officials do what they think is

18

right.

19

But I think the answer to that is that

JUSTICE BREYER:

Are you prepared to just

20

say, all right, they can do it some, just be careful

21

about it?

22
23

How far will you go with that?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

4

that's what -- you know, Justice Kennedy made the point

5

in his opinion in Grutter that the problem with

6

approving the first blunderbuss opportunity that you see

7

to use race in a context is that then you deprive the

8

courts of any role trying to refine matters, and seeing,

9

maybe the racial situation would be narrowly tailored,

10

That's what narrow tailoring meant.

And I think

but it is sure not these 50-15 bands.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Judge Kozinski thought the

12

real problem here was we should not deify strict

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

And it also

has some real world consequences when we decides we're

4

not going to apply the normal scrutiny we would to

racial classifications just because we've made some -- I

6

don't know based on what judgment that in this case, it

7

is benign, so we can trust the local school officials.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, it isn't that we've

made a judgment, the local school board has made a

10

judgment which has a lot of experience under both

systems.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

There's a lot of

experience in Brown, too, and those were local school

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about the other part?

3

Because I think the Solicitor General -- I hope, I don't

want to put words in his mouth -- but I think he agrees

5

that Brown held out the promise of an equal education,

6

that the country worked for 35 or 40 years to try to get

7

a degree of integration, and that maintaining it is

8

important.

They think this case goes too far.

And in that I think

10

he's referring to narrow tailoring.

It isn't narrowly

11

tailored enough.

think it is.

13

I think the Government agrees with that.

So I would appreciate knowing why you

MR. MELLEN:

We think it is, Your Honor, for

14

the very reasons that the District Court held it is.

15

The District Court addressed each of these points

in Grutter, looked at them very carefully and concluded

that it is narrowly tailored.

MR. MELLEN:

Magnet schools, Your Honor.

14

And with respect to history, Your Honor, it is somewhat

15

complex, because although the Court ruled in the Hampton

case in 2000 that the degree was dissolved then, the

17

board honestly felt beginning in 1981 that the decree

18

had been dissolved.

19

20

to the plan.

21

And so the board in 1984, 1991,

Beginning in the late 1980s, the board began

to introduce more choice into the system including

That is basically the same

that the starting point was that plan.

more stable and predictable, to make the use of race

We believe

4

that the use of race in this plan is self-limiting in

5

several respects.

6

Jefferson County continues to decline, which it has

7

somewhat since the 1970s, and the board has reason to

8

believe that the presence of racially integrated schools

during that period contributed to that -- there are

If racially segregated housing in

racially segregated housing continues to decline and if

this plan meets its purpose of diminishing racial

stereotypes and promoting better cross-racial

15

understanding throughout the community, we can foresee a

time when this board will not see a reason to use this

plan or may modify it further to make it even less

to that, Your Honor.

are racial attitudes in the community.
