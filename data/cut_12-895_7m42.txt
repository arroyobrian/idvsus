 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (10:03 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument first this morning in Case 12895, 

5

Rosemond v. United States. 

6

 Mr. Elwood. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

9

 MR. ELWOOD: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 It has long been a bedrock principle of 

12

American law that aiding and abetting liability requires 

13

proof that an accomplice act with purposeful intent to 

14

facilitate or encourage the crime of conviction and that 

15

mere knowing assistance is insufficient. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you agree that the jury 

17

could find the defendant guilty of the firearms charge 

18

under a proper instruction?  In other words, was there 

19

sufficient evidence so that if a proper instruction were 

20

given, there could have been a conviction? 

21

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Even if the  I think in this 

22

particular case, even if the jury had been given a 

23

proper instruction, it would have been a difficult 

24

charge to make out because the government never really 

25

argued facilitation after getting knowledge of the

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

firearm.  There was never evidence of foreknowledge; the 

2

government never asserted evidence of foreknowledge. 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I guess we can get 

4

into later to whether or not if you know a firearm is 

5

being carried and if you then facilitate the commission 

6

of the underlying felony by driving the car, 

7

participating in the transaction, whether that's 

8

sufficient. 

9

 But let me ask you this: 

Would the 

10

instruction that was given, which was at JA 196, would 

11

it be okay if Paragraph 1, "The defendant knew his 

12

cohort used a firearm," I think there is a real problem 

13

with that, because it's retrospective. 

14

 Would the instruction have been sufficient 

15

if the defendant knew his cohort would use or was 

16

carrying?  Would that change it? 

17

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Well, I think at least that 

18

would have required foreknowledge.  But I think it would 

19

still have been problematic because it would only have 

20

required knowing facilitation.  And courts, 

21

traditionally, have required intentional facilitation, 

22

that is, they intend to further the crime. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You do not agree, then, 

24

that if you know that there's going  that there's a bank 

25

robbery afoot and you're cooperating in that, you're 

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you're the wheelman, and you also know that the  you 

2

know that the people who are conducting the bank robbery 

3

are carrying firearms, you say that there's no criminal 

4

liability for the firearms unless you intended them to 

5

use the firearms; is that your position? 

6

 MR. ELWOOD: 

It's our position that you 

7

could infer from the fact that you're assisting the 

8

transaction involving 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10

 MR. ELWOOD: 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, no. 
Knowledge is not itself intent. 
Justice Scalia can protect  his 

12

own question.  But the question is:  What  what does 

13

the jury have to find?  I know they can  I know what 

14

they can infer, but the question from Justice Scalia is, 

15

you're the  you drive  you drive the car, you know 

16

firearms are there and might be used, is that 

17

sufficient?  And that's his question. 

18

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I  I think that that would 

19

be  that would support a verdict.  That would support 

20

a verdict.  The only question 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Now, wait.  It would 

22

support a verdict  you're saying it would support a 

23

finding of  of intent. 

24
25

 MR. ELWOOD: 

That's correct.  But the 

question is whether you don't even have to instruct a

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

jury 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Let's assume there's a lot 

3

of evidence that he didn't really want them to use 

4

firearms, that there's no way you can say he intended 

5

them to use, but he knew that they had firearms. 

6

 MR. ELWOOD: 

And I think that you can 

7

conclude from that that his purpose in assuming that 

8

he's driving 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  No, no, you can't. 

10

It's my hypothetical.  And you cannot conclude from 

11

that.  There is so much other evidence.  This  this 

12

man hates firearms.  He does not like firearms.  There 

13

is no way he could have intended them to use firearms. 

14

But he knew they had firearms. 

15

 MR. ELWOOD: 

You know, I hate to be accused 

16

of resisting the hypothetical, because in that  in 

17

that case, I don't think it matters whether you have the 

18

subjective desire, like you think, boy, I sure wish 

19

those firearms weren't involved.  But because at that 

20

point, your goal is to facilitate and make sure that 

21

this bank robbery 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Facilitate the crime. 
 with the gun succeeds.  The 

24

whole thing with the gun. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you don't have to  you

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

don't have to 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

But that is your  we would 

3

say that that is the purpose in facilitating.  And the 

4

question is not just that.  The question is whether 

5

you 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  So if you intend a 

7

crime  if you intend a crime and you know that the 

8

crime is being conducted with firearms, that's enough. 

9

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I don't think that that  I 

10

think that you have to have the fore  the 

11

foreknowledge.  And I think that there are certainly 

12

hypothesize 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Beforehand.  Before  you 

14

know beforehand that the crime is going to be 

15

perpetrated with firearms.  That's all you do.  You know 

16

beforehand, and you facilitate the crime. 

17

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I think that you  the 

18

question is whether  you can't even conceive of the 

19

circumstance where knowing  that is, participation 

20

knowing that a firearm would be used or carried. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, give me an example of 

that.  Give us 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

For example, if you agree to 

24

drive your neighbor to pick up drugs at some place in 

25

Philadelphia or  let's make it Pittsburgh.  And then

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you drive him to West Virginia to spend the weekend 

2

dealing.  On the way there he tells you, the guy who 

3

distributed these to me, you know, he always carries a 

4

Derringer in his boot. 

5

 And at that point, you don't facilitate his 

6

use or carriage of the gun with respect to the drug 

7

distribution offense.  It has no role in  in the 

8

crime.  And so I think you can conceive of enough 

9

circumstances 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And I don't  I don't 

11

understand the example.  The  the alleged aider and 

12

abetter learns about this after it's happened?  That's 

13

the idea? 

14

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Yes, but he's still 

15

facilitating the drug distribution offense at a time he 

16

knows that a gun is, you know, being carried in relation 

17

to it. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me change  let 

19

me  maybe this is the same as Justice Scalia's 

20

hypothetical, but let me try it.  Suppose that two guys 

21

have a meeting and it's  it's in a place that's 

22

where there's an electronic eavesdropping device.  In 

23

fact, there's a camera.  So it's all recorded.  So we 

24

know exactly what was said.  And the principal says, 

25

here's the deal, I'm going to rob a convenience store

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

and I'm going to carry a gun. 
 And the aider and abetter says, well, all 

3

right.  I'm in on the  you know, I'm in on robbing the 

4

convenience store, but I don't want anything having to 

5

do with the gun.  I think you should carry a baseball 

6

bat. 

7

 The principal says, no, that's the deal. 

8

I'm robbing the store.  I'm carrying a gun.  Take it or 

9

leave it.  Are you going to drive me there? 

10

 And  and the other guy says, I hate guns, 

11

I don't want to have anything to do with guns.  I  I 

12

hate this idea about the guns.  They go back and forth. 

13

 And the  the principal says finally, look, 

14

this is it.  This is the deal.  I'm robbing the store. 

15

I'm using a gun.  Are you going to help me or not? 

16

 And the guy says, well, all right. 

I'm 

17

going to drive you, but I want it noted for the record 

18

that I'm opposed  I'm opposed to the use of a gun. 

19

 (Laughter.) 

20

 MR. ELWOOD: 

And at that point, it's his 

21

purpose to facilitate a transaction and to, you know, 

22

help it succeed and it's at a time when he knows that a 

23

gun will be used and that  I think you can conclude 

24

that that is his purpose. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

See  so I don't really

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

see  I can't  I can't think of a situation where a 

2

person facilitates the crime, knows what the crime is 

3

going to be, knows that a gun is going to be used but 

4

doesn't intend for the gun to be used. 

5

 MR. ELWOOD: 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The question is 
In those two situations, 

7

knowledge and intent, seem to me to be  to be the same 

8

thing. 

9

 MR. ELWOOD: 

The question is whether there 

10

are  because there are just no instances that are more 

11

like my hypothetical than like your hypothetical.  So 

12

you don't even have to bother troubling the jury about 

13

whether they had the intent. 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I didn't understand 

your hypotheticals.  If you could give it to us again. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

Well, the point of it is that 

17

at a time when you are  when you are still 

18

participating in the underlying offense, the drug 

19

trafficking offense, you know that a gun is being 

20

carried in relation to it.  But you don't have any 

21

intent to facilitate it.  You don't care one way or the 

22

other if it gets used.  You don't intend to facilitate 

23

it, and you don't facilitate it.  And the question is 

24

whether there are 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But you facilitate 

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, that's  that's a 

2

conclusion.  The jury, it seems to me, could say you do 

3

facilitate it if in these hypotheticals you drive the 

4

car 

5

 MR. ELWOOD: 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

7
8
9
10
11

But the thing is 
 with knowledge that the 

gun might be used. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

No, but the gun is not going to 

be used in your act of facilitation.  It may be used 
over in Philadelphia, and you aren't doing 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, the submission is 

12
13

 MR. ELWOOD: 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And the question 
The  the gun would never 

15

have been used if you didn't drive the  or carried if 

16

you didn't drive the car. 

17

 MR. ELWOOD: 

But I think the jury could 

18

equally well conclude that you did not intend to 

19

facilitate the use of the gun and you did not facilitate 

20

the use of the gun.  And the question is whether you 

21

even need to trouble the jury with it.  Because the 

22

government's instruction conclusively presumes both 

23

knowledge  or conclusively presumes intent from 

24

knowledge alone and it conclusively presumes 

25

facilitation of the gun from facilitation of the

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

underlying offense. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Or in my  in my 

3

hypothetical, could a rational jury say he knew about 

4

it, but he didn't intend it? 

5

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I think that in your case with 

6

the foreknowledge and where he, you know, facilitates, 

7

he carries the gun and he carries the person to the 

8

offense, I think that that would be a tough slog.  In a 

9

case  but ours is a case where there isn't 

10

foreknowledge and the government never argued that he 

11

knew before the gun  before the gun was fired that it 

12

was his associate who was the shooter. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, in my case  and I'll 

14

finish.  I want to ask another question about this.  But 

15

in my case, if the judge had given the instruction, it's 

16

enough that he knew about it.  He facilitated the crime 

17

when he knew there was a gun.  Would that be error? 

18

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I think it would be error 

19

because you're instructing them on the wrong elements. 

20

It might be harmless error.  But the point  both sides 

21

agree here that you have to facilitate the crime of 

22

conviction and you have to intend that the gun be used. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't think it's ever 

24

harmless error to not instruct the jury  or to 

25

instruct the jury not to find one of the elements of the

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

crime.  If, indeed, intent is necessary, it seems to me 

2

he has to instruct the jury to find intent.  It's not up 

3

to the court to say, well, there surely was intent 

4

anyway so it's harmless error.  The jury has to find 

5

intent. 

6

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I think  you know what, I'm 

7

fine with it being a harmful error, too.  But my point 

8

was merely to note that I think that it is something 

9

that you have to instruct the jury on as a proper 

10
11
12
13
14
15

element 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Excuse me.  But what are 

we instructing 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

 even if it winds up not 

making a difference. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think what we're 

16

driving at here, and I think this is the moment you're 

17

resisting, but to me, and as you can tell from my 

18

colleague's questions, if you know that someone's 

19

carrying a gun, and whether you want them to use it or 

20

not is irrelevant, if they take it out and use it and 

21

you have gone along with them in the crime, you're 

22

guilty.  Okay?  That  that's what we're driving at. 

23

 Assume that I believe that. 

Assume that I 

24

believe that if you have knowledge of the gun, and that 

25

I am participating in the crime with your knowledge of

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that gun, whether the knowledge is secured before the 

2

crime starts or during the crime, if I continue to 

3

participate in the crime knowing that you have a gun, 

4

then that's knowledge of the gun and intent to 

5

facilitate. 

6

 I thought the example that you were relying 

7

on here or the issue that got confused in the briefs was 

8

whether or not, from the sequence of facts in this case, 

9

you can actually discern that intent to facilitate the 

10

crime because the alleged shooter, which your client 

11

said was someone else, jumped into the car and the car 

12

took off before anybody could abandon the crime.  That's 

13

what I actually thought this case was about:  At what 

14

juncture do you instruct the jury to say that you have 

15

to be a participant with knowledge of the crime? 

16

 But you're saying something different right 

17

now.  You're almost suggesting that there has to be a 

18

preknowledge that the gun will be used. 

19

 MR. ELWOOD: 

No, I don't think  I don't 

20

think that there has to be preknowledge.  My point is 

21

this:  That there are circumstances I think where you 

22

can know of a gun and be participating in the underlying 

23

 underlying predicate offense and not facilitate the 

24

use of the gun.  And I 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm hard to imagine

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that.  Give me an example. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

For example, if you  your 

3

job, you're the lowest level guy in a drug organization. 

4

You stand on a street corner every night and you hand 

5

out drugs to anybody who comes up.  You don't carry a 

6

gun.  Nobody has ever carried a gun at that street 

7

corner.  One night you're doing it and you see that the 

8

guy is  that the guy who you work for, his enforcer is 

9

coming by and you know he always carries a gun.  He 

10

walks behind you and, you know, he's present and around 

11

you for about 90 seconds, but during that time, you do 

12

exactly what you always did. 

13

 I think a jury could conclude  and I'm not 

14

saying that they couldn't conclude otherwise, but they 

15

could conclude that he didn't facilitate the use or 

16

carriage of the gun.  He was just 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

instruction look like? 

19

 MR. ELWOOD: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What would the 

It would just 
To  to  what would 

21

it look like to capture the difference you're trying to 

22

convey? 

23

 MR. ELWOOD: 

It would just say that the 

24

that the jury has to find that the defendant facilitated 

25

the use or carriage of a gun during and in relation to a

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

crime of violence or a drug trafficking offense 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3

 MR. ELWOOD: 

4
5

Well, then you come 
 and that they intended to do 

so. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 you come up against 

6

the government's argument that you don't have to 

7

facilitate every element. 

8

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Right.  But that's the thing. 

9

Those are what we think would be the proper instruction, 

10

that they just have to be instructed on the facilitation 

11

and on the intent. 

12
13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm surprised to hear you 

say that you don't need prior knowledge. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: I am too. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: I think you need prior knowledge. 

16

 MR. ELWOOD: 

17

I think you have to have prior 

knowledge before you facilitate it.  I think that 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Right.  Exactly. 

20

 MR. SCALIA: 

So what did you mean by  by 

21
22

Yes. 

you don't need prior knowledge? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

You don't need prior knowledge 

23

before the whole transaction happens.  If you continue 

24

to  if there's an act of facilitation after you learn 

25

of it 

26

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

After you know.

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Right.  Exactly.  That's all I 

2

mean by the absence of prior knowledge.  But I mean, 

3

everyone here agrees that you need to have knowledgeable 

4

before facilitation. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Elwood, you're 

6

dealing with all kinds of hypotheticals.  But in this 

7

case we had a jury determination that Rosemond was the 

8

person  he was convicted of carrying ammunition, 

9

right?  There were two counts of carrying  possession 

10

of the ammunition.  And couldn't one infer from that 

11

that if he  he possessed the ammunition, he was the gun 

12

carrier? 

13

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Two things, Justice Ginsburg. 

14

First, the government never raised this below and it 

15

wasn't pressed or passed on below, and so I think under 

16

Glover v. United States this Court wouldn't ordinarily 

17

consider that in the first instance, would leave it for 

18

remand. 

19

 But secondly, I think that it's not clear 

20

enough.  I mean, you can't say beyond a reasonable doubt 

21

that the error didn't infect that, too, because the jury 

22

was instructed four times that you can possess something 

23

through constructive possession, through a confederate. 

24

And I think when the jury concludes that he is guilty of 

25

a possession offense, which is 924(c) as a possession

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offense, as an aider and abetter, and they marked on the 

2

judge's instruction that he used the gun, he carried the 

3

gun, that the jury could have believed that they were 

4

that he constructively possessed the gun and thereby 

5

constructively possessed the ammunition. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What was the evidence 

7

that the jury had on whether he possessed the 

8

ammunition? 

9

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I think the only evidence of 

10

possession was that it was inside the gun that was 

11

fired.  And I think the jury rejected the idea that he 

12

was the shooter because the two eyewitnesss said that 

13

the shooter was someone else, that the shooter was the 

14

guy in the backseat, who was Ronald Joseph. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I just didn't  you said 

the only evidence was that it was inside the gun? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

The ammunition was inside the 

gun.  And the only evidence of his 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And what was the evidence? 

20

I thought there was evidence that he possessed 

21

cartridges. 

22

 MR. ELWOOD: 

No.  The only evidence was that 

23

the evidence was inside the gun  or I'm sorry, the 

24

evidence  that the ammunition was inside the gun. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And was there any evidence

18

Alderson Reporting Company

4

that he had the gun? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

The evidence that he had the 

gun was the  the guy who was the other shooter 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I mean, was the evidence 

5

that he had the gun and the evidence of the cartridges 

6

are exactly the same? 

7

 MR. ELWOOD: 

They are exactly the same.  The 

8

only evidence was that the cartridges were inside the 

9

gun.  And the evidence  the two eyewitnesss who were 

10

at the scene said that the person got out of the 

11

driver's side, and the evidence suggests that Mr. 

12

Rosemond was on the passenger side, and that he got out 

13

of the backseat, and he was in the front seat. 

14

 So the  the evidence, I think, is that he 

15

was  he was merely in the car, not that he was a 

16

shooter.  And the jury, remember, asked:  Do we have to 

17

answer question 3, which was the  all the different 

18

ways you can use the gun  if we find him guilty on an 

19

aiding and abetting theory?  Which certainly suggests 

20

they did not believe he was the shooter. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Did  did he facilitate 

the crime after the shots were fired? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

The government did not ever 

24

argue facilitation after the shots were fired, I suspect 

25

because  they only argued that he  that what

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

happened afterwards was evidence he was the shooter.  I 

2

suspect because they appreciated that the offense was 

3

over with.  He was only charged with possession of 

4

marijuana with intent to distribute.  When Mr. Gonzales 

5

took off with the marijuana and they lost control, you 

6

know, they went around afterwards looking for him, 

7

which, you know, there's not even very much evidence of 

8

that. 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But do we have cases that 

10

say that assisting flight immediately after the crime is 

11

not aiding and abetting the crime?  The crime is over? 

12

So everybody says the crime's over.  Let's  let's walk 

13

home. 

14

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I  I am not aware and the 

15

government hasn't cited any.  I mean, there's 

16

there's  for different crimes, you know, there's 

17

there's different law about whether flight is part of 

18

the offense. 

19

 But in any event, the question is whether 

20

that would be aiding and abetting that crime, the 

21

possession offense or some distinct crime, or whether 

22

that would be being an accessory after the fact.  And 

23

that was never charged. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is it  is it just 

flight?  I thought there was evidence that they were

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

chasing the people who robbed them. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

There was no evidence that that 

3

intent to chase them was ever communicated to Mr. 

4

Rosemond. 

5
6
7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, he jumps in 

the car and, you know, they're going after them. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

That itself was disputed.  But 

8

the question is, even if they're chasing him, that might 

9

be attempt to possess the marijuana to get it back.  It 

10

might be conspiracy to possess the marijuana, but that 

11

wasn't  wasn't charged.  The only thing was 

12

possession. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, it might be 

14

it might be an effort to continue the crime of  in 

15

other words, it might make a difference whether the 

16

people who are being chased look and see two guys in the 

17

car or three guys in the car.  If somebody says  and I 

18

realize you dispute these facts  let's go get them and 

19

the guy jumps in the car, it seems to me that that's 

20

aiding and abetting the underlying illegal activity with 

21

knowledge, of course, that guns were used. 

22

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I agree.  But first, that's not 

23

a theory that the government ever espoused.  They never 

24

argued that facilitation. 

25

 And secondly, I don't know that that would

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be facilitation of possession of marijuana with intent 

2

to distribute it.  That ended under the court's 

3

instructions when they lost control of the marijuana 

4

when Mr. Gonzales disappeared. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I understand your argument 

6

about intent, but are you also arguing that the  that 

7

the actus reus instruction was insufficient?  The 

8

instruction about what your client did? 

9
10

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Yes. 

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you think it's necessary 

11

for an aider and abetter to facilitate every element of 

12

a criminal offense? 

13

 MR. ELWOOD: 

We're not saying that.  We are 

14

saying that when you  you have to instruct them did he 

15

facilitate the actual crime of conviction.  Because what 

16

the government is doing here, what their instruction 

17

does is it conclusively presumes that he facilitated the 

18

distinct offense, which this Court has said, the 

19

entirely new crime of 924(c), from the fact that they 

20

did the underlying offense. 

21

 Their favorite example in the brief is a 

22

mail fraud example.  But under the government's theory, 

23

because you engage in an act of mail fraud, you could be 

24

convicted of racketeering without any additional actus 

25

reus because that is a predicate crime to RICO.  And

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's the thing is we're just saying you can't presume 

2

the full offense  facilitation of the full offense 

3

from the fact that you just facilitated one element. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So if there were not  if 

5

the  the drug offense itself were not illegal, there  there 

6

wasn't a drug offense and then the  the additional 

7

firearm element, it wouldn't be necessary for him  for 

8

the defendant to facilitate every element of that 

9

offense.  It's dependent on the fact that there's this 

10
11

other criminal conduct. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

We're just saying that they 

12

have to be  the jury just has to be instructed to ask, 

13

did he facilitate the crime of conviction?  And they're 

14

asking a different  they're asking a different 

15

question, essentially.  And it wouldn't present the same 

16

risk that you would convict someone twice and they'd 

17

serve two consecutive sentences under the hypothetical 

18

you suggest, but we still say they should be asked 

19

whether they facilitated the right crime. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, but the crime of 

21

conviction was  was a drug offense with the use of a 

22

firearm, right? 

23
24
25

 MR. ELWOOD: 

It was 924(c), a crime with the 

long name. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And so I thought  I

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thought that the law is pretty clear that if you  if 

2

you facilitate an offense, you do not have to facilitate 

3

each element of that offense, so long as you have 

4

knowledge that that element existed. 

5

 MR. ELWOOD: 

And our submission is just that 

6

the jury still has to be asked, did he facilitate the 

7

crime.  This is  both sides agree that you have to ask 

8

 that one of the elements is whether they facilitated 

9

the crime. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but more precisely, 

11

they could be asked did he facilitate the drug deal 

12

knowing that a firearm was going to be used in the drug 

13

deal.  Would that satisfy you? 

14
15
16
17
18

 MR. ELWOOD: 

No.  We think they're asking 

both the wrong questions then.  But  is there 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand what 

your position is.  He has to use the gun himself? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

No.  His  our only position 

19

is that they have to ask the jury, did he facilitate the 

20

924(c) offense. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No.  I think it would help 

22

if you told us what the definition of the crime is. 

23

We'll talk about the jury instructions later. 

24

Justice Scalia is asking whether or not if you 

25

facilitate the drug crime knowing that a weapon is being

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

carried, if that is sufficient for aiding and abetting 

2

as a legal matter?  Forget the jury instructions. 

3

 MR. ELWOOD: 

And it's our submission that 

4

you have to both facilitate the 924(c) offense and that 

5

you have to have the intent that the gun be used or 

6

carried during and in relation to the crime. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Does that  does that 

8

have to do with the additional 120 months?  The 

9

underlying crime is 48 months and then the  the gun 

10
11

makes it 120 months more consecutive? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

That's right.  But it's  I 

12

think our  the reason why we think it makes a 

13

difference is because it's a different crime.  And the 

14

government is trying to get the jury to conclusively 

15

presume from the fact that you did the one crime, that 

16

you must also have facilitated the other.  And we just 

17

don't think that that is something that you can say with 

18

100 percent certainty so you can remove it from jury 

19

determination. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Isn't criminal law  isn't 

21

criminal law replete with crimes which have lesser 

22

included offenses as part of them?  So wouldn't your 

23

rule be a very difficult one to apply because it would 

24

suggest that the person had to facilitate some part of 

25

the crime that was not a part of a lesser included

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

offense? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

There are some courts that 

3

apply this, our rationale to lesser included's as well. 

4

But lesser included crimes are the same crime for 

5

Blockburger purposes.  You can't be sentenced to both 

6

the greater and the lesser.  And I think most courts 

7

require that you show the intent that the gun be used. 

8

They don't as often require that you facilitate the 

9

discreet use of or carriage of a gun. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me go back to my 

11

earlier hypothetical about the taped conversation. 

12

Suppose that the alleged aider and abetter there says, I 

13

intend for you to use the gun.  I have that intent. 

14

However, I'm not going to do one thing to help you get 

15

the gun or use the gun.  I don't want to  I'm not 

16

going to.  There's an actus reus problem there because 

17

he doesn't facilitate the use of the gun? 

18

 MR. ELWOOD: 

Well, he may say that he is not 

19

going to facilitate it, but, depending on what his 

20

actions are, he may  very well may facilitate it.  If 

21

he drives the gun and the person to the  the crime, 

22

you know, that is an act of facilitation.  And so, you 

23

know, it doesn't depend on what the person says.  It 

24

depends on what the person does. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I just want to make clear,

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and we'll get back to the bank robbery hypothetical. 

2

Driving the car, knowing that a gun is being carried and 

3

might be used, is or is not sufficient facilitation to 

4

make you an aider and abetter in the drug  in the gun 

5

aspect of the crime? 

6

 MR. ELWOOD: 

I think that that would be 

7

enough, because you are carrying the gun as well as the 

8

person. 

9
10
11
12

14

 If I could reserve 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But you are not carrying. 

Your  your cohort is carrying the gun. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

Oh.  Yes, you're carrying 

you're  by carrying  the gun is in your car. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You are driving the car, 

15

the cohort has the gun, the cohort is going to rob the 

16

bank.  Are you or are you not aiding and abetting 

17

because you're facilitating it by driving the car, yes 

18

or no? 

19

 MR. ELWOOD: 

We would say that, yes, that is 

20

certainly enough to go to the jury and that  I think 

21

that that would be enough to show that, because you're 

22

carrying both the gun on your cohort and you're carrying 

23

the cohort, that that would be enough to facilitate 

24

that. 

25

 I would like 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

2

enough to go to the jury and what you would ask the jury

facilitation. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

In addition, the jury would 

have to find intent.

Not just to find those 

That is correct. 
Okay.

 Mr. Bash. 

Thank you, counsel. 

18

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. BASH 

19

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

20
21
22

 MR. BASH: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 I'd like to start by defining exactly what 

23

the government contends the mens rea requirement is for 

24

aiding and abetting, and then give the Court an 

25

example  two examples to show how it differs both from

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what Mr. Elwood is saying and how it differs from a 

2

knowledge standard. 

3

 Aiding and abetting requires an intent to 

4

facilitate or encourage the commission of an offense. 

5

And I think that breaks down into two constituent parts: 

6

One, an intent to make some action easier or to 

7

encourage some action by the principal; two, the 

8

knowledge that the principal intends to commit a crime 

9

of which that action is a constituent part. 

10

 What Mr. Elwood is saying is something quite 

11

different.  It's that you have to intend that the crime 

12

succeed.  If that's true, all paid accomplices are out 

13

if they don't intend that the crime succeed.  If the 

14

if the bank robbers say, hey, can you look the other 

15

way, security guard, while we go into the bank, we'll 

16

give you a thousand dollars if you do it, that's not 

17

aiding and abetting under his theory if the security 

18

guard says, well, I only wanted a thousand dollars; I 

19

didn't care whether you ultimately succeeded in the 

20

bank. 

21

 We give an example in our brief: 

If the 

22

person actually gives the gun so it meets the actus reus 

23

requirement that Mr. Elwood has proposed, he actually 

24

gives the gun to somebody, not because he cares if that 

25

person commits the crime, which he knows he intends to

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

commit, but as a favor or as a friendly gesture 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's a very 

3

fanciful hypothetical, because the one thing the guard 

4

is going to know, that if the robber gets caught, he's 

5

in great jeopardy of  of being caught himself and 

6

convicted.  Of course he wants the crime to succeed 

7

because he doesn't want the people to be there and being 

8

pressured by investigators or whatever to say, okay, you 

9

know, who was in on  who was in on this with you? 

10

 So if you're  if you're being paid for a 

11

crime, to assist in the commission of the crime, you 

12

want it to succeed. 

13

 MR. BASH: 

Well, if your payment is not 

14

coming from the loot, I don't think that's really true. 

15

But let's take that as true as given.  I mean, go back 

16

to my example about the guy that's just doing a favor 

17

for somebody.  Sure, you can use my gun to commit a 

18

robbery.  I don't have any stake in it.  If you decide 

19

tomorrow that you don't want to commit the robbery, 

20

that's fine with me. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

He has a stake in 

22

it.  If the guy is caught, the police are going to say, 

23

where did you get the gun?  He may turn him in or not, 

24

but it's certainly a danger, a danger that wouldn't be 

25

there if the crime succeeded.

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BASH: 

I don't  I don't think that's 

2

the sort of intent requirement that Mr. Elwood is 

3

talking about.  I mean, I think he's talking about an 

4

intent that's abstracted from the idea that if you get 

5

caught, everybody might go to jail.  I mean, that sort 

6

of seems to beg the question of whether you're actually 

7

going to be liable for the gun. 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, why don't we just 

take it that we have a crime, the underlying crime, it's 

10

a 48month crime, and then if you have a gun in 

11

connection with that crime, it becomes 120 months 

12

consecutive.  And your position seems to be that all you 

13

have to prove is facilitation of the underlying drug 

14

offense.  And it seems to me to  to get 10 years of 

15

your life for the government proving no more than the 

16

48month charge is a bit much. 

17

 MR. BASH: 

It's not proving no more than the 

18

48month charge.  And I'll just  as a footnote, it's 

19

10 years only if the gun is fired.  It's 5 years if it's 

20

carried or used, and which obviously creates a much 

21

greater danger to people's lives and property if it's 

22

fired. 

23

 But it's not only proving that you 

24

facilitated the drug offense.  It's facilitating the 

25

drug offense with the foreknowledge that a gun was going

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

to be involved in it. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But this instruction at 

3

J196 says that the defendant "knew his cohort used a 

4

firearm."  It really should say that "knew his cohort 

5

would carry a firearm." 

6

 MR. BASH: 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Justice Kennedy, two points. 
Because as I  when I 

8

read this, I thought, well, given these confusing facts, 

9

a jury might think that there's liability if he knew 

10

that a firearm was used, which is a very odd 

11

interpretation, but that's  the instruction lends 

12

itself to that interpretation. 

13

 MR. BASH: 

Justice Kennedy, that is an odd 

14

interpretation and it's wrong and we do not contend that 

15

liability could be imposed if you learned of the gun 

16

only after your participation ended.  A couple points on 

17

that. 

18
19
20
21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But do you agree that, 

taken by itself, that one could be read that way? 
 MR. BASH: 

Well, I don't think read in the 

context of the full instruction.  If you look at 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

23

 MR. BASH: 

I said taken by itself. 
Oh, so not the instruction taken 

24

by itself, but one phrase in the instruction taken by 

25

itself?

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

2

 MR. BASH: 

Yes. 
I think it's possible, but I 

3

think if you read it in the context of the full charge 

4

and what reasonable jurors would think, you have the 

5

formulation right above that on page 196 that mirrors 

6

exactly the Peoni standard.  And I don't think 

7

reasonable jurors reading that in conjunction with the 

8

more specific instruction on count 2 could think that he 

9

could be liable if his participation ended only after 

10
11

the firearm was used. 
 And, Justice Kennedy, nobody below thought 

12

that, because Petitioner never objected on the grounds 

13

that the particular wording of this instruction allowed 

14

conviction if you gained knowledge only after your 

15

participation.  So at minimum 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, he proposed 

17

he proposed a different instruction that departed from 

18

the instruction that was given on that point. 

19

 MR. BASH: 

Mr. Chief Justice, first of all, 

20

under Rule 30 it is not enough to propose an alternative 

21

instruction that does not contain the defect.  You have 

22

to lay out the specific grounds for your objection.  He 

23

did not do that here, so it should be plain error 

24

review. 

25

 That is doubly true here where his

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instruction had its own error.  His instruction would 

2

have required intentional facilitation of the gun, which 

3

is the question on this Court granted certiorari.  His 

4

instruction had 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6

don't make a right. 

7

 MR. BASH: 

Two  two wrongs 

Two wrongs don't make a right, 

8

but he certainly did not comply with the Rule 30 

9

standard for raising the objection with respect to 

10

foreknowledge that he  that he's proposing now.  So, 

11

at minimum, that should be reviewed for plain error. 

12

 In addition, even if the Court believes that 

13

we waived the harmless error argument by not raising it 

14

below with respect to his primary argument, the Court 

15

should certainly hear our plain error  or harmless 

16

error argument with respect to the ammunition counts, 

17

with respect to the instructional error that he did not 

18

raise below.  We should have the opportunity 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Look at his  look at his 

20

instruction and think about the bank robbery 

21

hypothetical with the driver of the car.  His number 2 

22

is that they intentionally took some action to 

23

facilitate or encourage the use of the firearm.  I think 

24

that would be an okay instruction in the bank robbery 

25

hypothetical.

He drove the car. 

3

Principal object was to rob the bank, not to use the 

4

firearm, but he facilitated the use of a firearm.  I can 

5

see that a judge could give that instruction. 

6

 MR. BASH: 

I think the only way Petitioner 

7

fits that instruction into his view of the law is 

8

because the driver started out driving the people to the 

9

bank, so he says, oh, well, you are satisfying my actus 

10

reus requirement because you actually transported the 

11

guns to the bank. 

12

 But tweak the hypothetical a little bit. 

13

Suppose the getaway driver is paid only to show up at 

14

the end and to, you know, ferry the bank robbers away. 

15

He knows all along that it's going to be a firearm 

16

offense.  I'm pretty sure Mr. Elwood would say:  Because 

17

you took no act facilitating the gun in that case, you 

18

only sort of showed up at the end, even though you knew 

19

a gun would be used, that that's not facilitation. 

20

 So I take your point, Justice Kennedy, that 

21

in a wide swath of cases it may not matter, but I think 

22

in some cases it is going to matter.  And  take his 

23

intent requirement.  I mean, the person that lends the 

24

gun just to be a good guy, not because he cares about 

25

the offense, I'm pretty sure he is out.  And if the jury

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is convinced, hey, I knew he was going to commit a 

2

robbery or assault but I just did not care, if the jury 

3

is convinced by that, he is acquitted, and that can't 

4

possibly be right.  He would not be guilty of any 924(c) 

5

offense at all.  I mean not only the tenyear 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you talk 

7

practically about what the difficulties are for the 

8

government in these scenarios?  It's nice to put 

9

hypotheticals in where you know, where you say someone 

10

knew X, Y and Z.  The reality is in most cases you 

11

don't.  Occasionally you get a coconspirator that will 

12

tell you, but in most cases you have just the act.  A 

13

defendant is present during a crime, a gun is pulled, 

14

and he leaves with his cohorts.  You don't know whether he 

15

had advance knowledge that the gun would be used because 

16

he wasn't carrying it and he may have done nothing but 

17

be present during the crime, left, and got a split of 

18

the money later, correct? 

19
20
21
22

 MR. BASH: 

If he continued participating 

after he learned of the gun, yes. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's your point, 

right? 

23

 MR. BASH: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

 MR. BASH: 

Yes. 
That's your 

If he learned of the gun and

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

said, hey, I'm out of this, he's not guilty. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So isn't this really an 

3

argument about how you define facilitation?  You are not 

4

arguing that  that some form of participation in the 

5

crime with knowledge that the gun is being used is 

6

required.  You are really arguing about how far the 

7

proof has to go. 

8

 MR. BASH: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I 
Because your adversary 

10

keeps saying mere knowledge that the gun's being used is 

11

not enough. 

12

 MR. BASH: 

I think it's more qualitative 

13

than that and the question suggests it's purely 

14

quantitative.  It's qualitative in the sense that the 

15

facilitation can relate to either element.  So it can 

16

relate to the gun in particular or  and this could be 

17

the guy that set up the drug deal knowing that a gun 

18

would be involved, or set up the robbery knowing that a 

19

gun would be involved. 

20

 I think you see in the courts of appeals 

21

cases here the practical difficulties that come in 

22

because, although most court of appeals, I think eight, 

23

have technically adopted the position that you have to 

24

facilitate the gun in a direct way, if you look at the 

25

actual holdings of the cases it doesn't differ in

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

practical application from our approach. 
 It's  there is one case, I think it's 

3

Price out of the Third Circuit, where the guy may have 

4

learned of the gun  I may have the case name wrong, 

5

but the guy learned of the gun only as the robbery 

6

was  was taking place, but he continued to participate 

7

in the robbery while his confederate brandished the gun, 

8

he collected the money and so forth. 

9

 And as far as your question about the 

10

practical problems, I think explaining to a jury what 

11

does it mean to facilitate the gun in a specific way 

12

during a crime like that is incredibly difficult.  I 

13

mean, we say in the brief:  What if you are exchanging 

14

the money while the other person is brandishing the 

15

firearm?  Maybe that person 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What is so hard about 

17

saying, did you have knowledge that the gun would be 

18

used, either  and you facilitate  but you continue 

19

to facilitate the crime? 

20

 MR. BASH: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22

 MR. BASH: 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

We 
 the underlying crime. 

We agree that that is law. 
Well, Mr. Bash, what about 

24

this case?  Suppose that there are two guys and they are 

25

talking about committing a crime, and they have the same

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

kind of conversation that Justice Alito was referencing, 

2

you know, one guy says I want to bring a gun, the other 

3

says, no, I think that's a really bad idea.  But this 

4

time, the guy says:  Okay, you've convinced me, it's a 

5

bad idea to bring a gun, I won't bring a gun. 

6

 And so then they go out and they rob 

7

whatever they are robbing, and in the middle of it, you 

8

know  or they do a drug transaction, and in the middle 

9

of that drug transaction the guy who said don't bring a 

10

gun looks over and he realizes that, notwithstanding the 

11

promise, his confederate did bring a gun.  But there 

12

they are, they are in the middle of their drug 

13

transaction. 

14

 So the guy, you know, they're right  they 

15

are handing the money to each other and the guy keeps on 

16

doing it, all right?  Is  is that enough, even though, 

17

you know, there's foreknowledge, there's acts after he 

18

 he realizes that the guy has a gun?  Is that 

19

sufficient? 

20

 MR. BASH: 

If the gun is drawn and the 

21

person continues to facilitate the drug crime or the 

22

violent crime, that is enough. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, what exactly would you 

24

want him to do at that point to not be convicted of 

25

this, of this offense?  Would you want him to just say,

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you know, sort of like drop everything, I'm out of 

2

there?  Is that the idea? 

3

 MR. BASH: 

Yeah.  Take this case.  This is 

4

an $800 marijuana deal.  It's a smallscale drug deal 

5

that happens all the time without firearms.  As Mr. 

6

Elwood says, usually this kind of deal is not done with 

7

a firearm; only 5 percent of marijuana offenses have a 

8

firearm. 

9

 Yes, if you are on that kind of smallscale 

10

deal and all of a sudden it becomes an armed offense, 

11

you do have an obligation to withdraw.  Now, of course, 

12

I think you might have a duress defense if you felt like 

13

if I withdraw I'm going to get shot, or something like 

14

that. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right.  I mean, I guess 

16

that's the question:  Is there always a reasonable 

17

opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun 

18

in the offense that you didn't expect to be there?  And 

19

do you think that there has to be a reasonable 

20

opportunity to withdraw, or would you say, no, everybody 

21

has a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time; 

22

you can just leave? 

23

 MR. BASH: 

Two points on that.  First, I 

24

think a lot of that would come in through the duress 

25

defense.  I mean, if you really feel like, oh, my God,

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this guy has a gun and he might shoot me if I withdraw, 

2

I think you have a pretty solid duress defense. 

3

 The other point I would say which is maybe a 

4

little tangential to the hypothetical, is there's a 

5

traditional doctrine of aiding and abetting law.  This 

6

is at 2.06 of the Model Penal Code.  It's in the LaFave 

7

Treatise and the Wharton Treatise, that if you 

8

countermand your assistance after you have assisted but 

9

before the crime is accomplished or completed  for 

10

example, if your assistance was only encouraging and you 

11

start discouraging, or if you take all actions possible 

12

to prevent the crime  for example, you assisted, you 

13

have a change of heart, you call the police to prevent 

14

the crime, you are not liable for aiding and abetting. 

15

 And I think that reflects a broader point, 

16

which is that the traditional common law contours of 

17

aiding and abetting work pretty well with the 

18

contemporary purposes and problems that this statute was 

19

designed to solve.  I mean, this is a statute about the 

20

mix of guns and drugs or guns and violence.  And I don't 

21

see why Mr. Elwood contends that if you assist one side 

22

of that equation or the other it is a different result. 

23

I think if you assist either side of that equation, 

24

knowing that the equation is going to happen, by the 

25

principle, that is aiding and abetting.  It's aiding and

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

abetting under the historical test, I think it's aiding 

2

and abetting under this Court's cases, and I don't see 

3

why it would be a different result here. 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Bash, would you 

5

explain why in this situation the gun abetted a drug 

6

deal when there was no drug deal?  It had been thwarted. 

7

The drugs were stolen.  They were not engaged in any 

8

attempt to sell the drugs.  That was a failed attempt. 

9

So how is this done, abetting a drug deal, when the deal 

10
11

failed? 
 MR. BASH: 

Well, of course, the 

12

prosecution's principal theory was that he was the 

13

gunman; he brought it along to facilitate his drug deal. 

14

But assuming the theory of the facts that the gun was 

15

fired after Gonzales absconded with the drugs, I mean, I 

16

think one way to think about it is like this:  Suppose 

17

that what had happened is that Gonzales had gotten ten 

18

paces, and Petitioner or Joseph had tackled him and 

19

immediately snatched the drugs back.  I don't think this 

20

Court or courts generally would expect the government to 

21

charge two counts of possession with intent to 

22

distribute for that brief period in which someone 

23

snatches possession away and you get it.  That was 

24

certainly what the prosecutor thought here, and it's 

25

obviously not the issue in this case.

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The only way that question comes into this 

2

case is that Mr. Elwood is trying to say that the 

3

prosecutor understood that  that you didn't need 

4

foreknowledge of the gun.  And that's not what the 

5

prosecutor understood.  The prosecutor understood that 

6

this offense could continue for at least some period 

7

after in which the Confederates gave chase to  to 

8

reclaim the drugs. 

9

 And that may have been a wrong theory, but 

10

no one below ever understood that you could be convicted 

11

if you didn't know of the gun until your participation 

12

ended.  That's why Petitioner never objected on that 

13

ground, and that's why, of course, we submit that it 

14

should be reviewed for plain error. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And  and you agree that 

16

for aiding and abetting, you must  the gun offense, 

17

you must have knowledge that the gun is being carried by 

18

the cohort. 

19

 MR. BASH: 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

21

 MR. BASH: 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
You agree with that. 
Carried or used, yes. 
Could the defendant here 

23

have  could the defendant here have been convicted of 

24

possession of the ammunition on the theory that  under 

25

the instructions  would the instructions have allowed

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that conviction on the theory that the defendant aided 

2

and abetted somebody else's possession of the 

3

ammunition? 

4

 MR. BASH: 

I don't think so, because the 

5

judge never instructed that if you aid and abet, that's 

6

is the equivalent of constructive possession of  of 

7

the bullets.  And, in fact, I mean, what constructive 

8

possession means is that you have the ability to 

9

exercise control over this  over the ammunition.  So 

10

it doesn't gel with his theory that, oh, I didn't know 

11

about the gun until after the shots were fired. 

12

 I mean, I don't think anyone thought that 

13

you could get a conviction because the shells were on 

14

the ground or something and you could pick them up after 

15

they were fired.  The obvious view was that he was 

16

the person who shot the gun  and at minimum, I think 

17

those convictions, because there were no aiding and 

18

abetting instructions on them, show that he must have 

19

known about the gun ahead of time if he could exercise, 

20

at minimum, constructive possession over the ammunition 

21

fired from 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What  what's the 

23

point of charging him with possession of the gun and 

24

possession of the bullets in the gun?  It would seem to 

25

me that the proof would be pretty much the same.

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BASH: 

The proof  the proof was the 

2

same in this case.  They didn't charge him with 

3

possession of the gun.  They charged him with use or 

4

carrying during and in relation to the drug trafficking 

5

offense.  And then there were two counts of possession 

6

of the ammunition, which were linked to his felony 

7

status and his alien  unlawful alien status. 

8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I guess, then, 

the question is:  What's the point of charging him with 

10

possession of the bullets if you're not charging him 

11

with possession of the gun? 

12

 MR. BASH: 

It  we could have charged him 

13

with possession as a felon.  We didn't.  It's not 

14

totally clear to me why we didn't.  But we certainly 

15

could have charged him with being a felon in possession 

16

of a firearm in this case. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Bash, you know, what 

18

sticks in my craw a little bit about your position is 

19

this:  Usually, we want punishments to  two people and 

20

they do very different things and they have very 

21

different intents, we want them actually to be punished 

22

differently. 

23

 And what you're suggesting is that there 

24

is  let's say a crime, two people are involved in it. 

25

One person does almost everything.  You know, he does

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

90 percent of the stuff.  And the other person does just 

2

a little thing, but something, you know, that goes to 

3

the offense that helps facilitate the offense.  But it's 

4

really pretty small compared to the overall crime. 

5

 And then in addition to that, that person 

6

does not have really fullfledged intent, just has a 

7

kind of knowledge that this other person with real 

8

purpose of intent is going to bring a gun. 

9

 So  so, you have a lesser act and a lesser 

10

intent, and notwithstanding that, you're saying that the 

11

person ought to be punished in the exact same way as his 

12

confederate. 

13

 MR. BASH: 

We are saying that.  I think 

14

that  that  that gels with the historic law of 

15

aiding and abetting, which, as Judge Friendly said in a 

16

case we cite in our brief, Garguilo, assistance of even 

17

slight moment counts.  And 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I guess what I would 

19

have thought was that the actus reus can be very small, 

20

but almost to compensate for that, you have to have 

21

fullfledged intent.  You have to have a really kind of 

22

purpose of  a  a purpose that the crime succeed as 

23

opposed to just knowledge of  of what will happen. 

24
25

 MR. BASH: 

Justice Kagan, I don't think that 

can be right for the examples I gave, paid accomplices

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that don't have a stake or the person who lends the gun 

2

to be a good guy.  And let me contrast that  I never 

3

got to this example  with what a pure knowledge 

4

standard would look like. 

5

 Suppose there was looting, and the defendant 

6

breaks into the  a store to facilitate his own entry 

7

in the store to steal goods.  But he knows there's 20 

8

people coming behind him, and he has now facilitated 

9

their entry into the store, too.  That is not aiding and 

10

abetting under our theory because he did not even bear 

11

the intent to facilitate, by which we mean the intent to 

12

make some step in another person's crime easier.  He 

13

knew it would do that, but that was incidental to an 

14

intent to facilitate his own crime. 

15

 So I do think the mens rea is significantly 

16

ratcheted up from what a pure knowledge standard would 

17

look like. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would you agree that in 

19

order to show aiding and abetting  and I'll just quote 

20

from a California case here  that, "The aider and 

21

abetter has to have knowledge of the criminal purpose of 

22

the perpetrator and the intent to facilitate it"? 

23

 MR. BASH: 

Yes.  I think what that 

24

formulation masks is exactly what intent to facilitate 

25

means, and I think that might be part of the

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

disagreement among the parties.  And what we say is that 

2

it means an intent to make some step in what you know is 

3

a crime that he intend  the principal intends to do 

4

easier.  And we think it's got to be that. 

5

 That's also the formulation in the 

6

historical sources we cite at page 47 at Footnote 10 of 

7

our brief.  It's either the intent to commit the crime 

8

yourself or knowledge that the other person has that 

9

intent.  And I don't see how it can be anything else. 

10

 I mean, if  if you assist someone in a 

11

just to be a good person, not because you care if the 

12

crime succeeds, and if you ask them in  with the truth 

13

serum, do you want the crime to succeed, you say, well, 

14

I'm totally indifferent to the crime. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would you  would you 

16

agree that the statement  that the first part of the 

17

instruction that the district court gave, "defendant 

18

knew his cohort used a firearm," is inaccurate?  Is 

19

incomplete? 

20

 MR. BASH: 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

22

 MR. BASH: 

Not 
Potentially misleading? 
In isolation, potentially 

23

misleading.  I think in context, how reasonable jurors 

24

would understand this and how the parties understood it, 

25

because nobody raised an objection to this below, I

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think they understood that your knowledge had to arise 

2

before your completion 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

4

 MR. BASH: 

5
6

You would 

 of your participation in the 

offense. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You would never 

7

if you got a call from the U.S.  assistant U.S. 

8

attorney in the field said, this is the instruction I'm 

9

going to use, you would tell him, no, don't do that. 

10

 MR. BASH: 

We  we wouldn't.  But the 

11

reason this Court has  or the reason courts generally 

12

have objection rules is when questions about particular 

13

verb tenses and phrasings arise, the defendant or one of 

14

the parties is supposed to actually object to that in 

15

the district court.  That didn't happen here. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, I know you have 

17

arguments about failure to object and harmless error. 

18

But on the substance of it, you think the instruction 

19

you would never counsel someone to give that 

20

instruction. 

21

 MR. BASH: 

Well, I think as we said in the 

22

brief, it would have been clearer to say "would use" or 

23

something that  that makes absolutely clear that you 

24

required foreknowledge.  I think if the Court has 

25

questions about this sort of casespecific issue along

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with the forfeiture and waiver and harmless error and 

2

plain error issues, it could do this, and this would be 

3

a sensible result, it could clarify, one, facilitation 

4

with respect to either conduct element is enough as far 

5

as actus reus.  Two, the intent to facilitate means an 

6

intent to make some step in that crime easier combined 

7

with knowledge that the principal bears the intent to 

8

complete the crime.  And then it could remand to the 

9

court of appeals to say, sort out whether this 

10

instruction was wrong, whether that objection was 

11

forfeited, whether harmless error or plain error 

12

concepts come in here. 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why  why do you say 

you say in context, it was okay.  What  what context? 
 MR. BASH: 

The  Justice Scalia, the 

16

instruction  or part of the same instruction, the 

17

paragraph immediately before just mirrored 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's it?  Just that?  "In 

19

order to aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is 

20

necessary that the defendant willfully and knowingly 

21

associated himself in some way with the crime." 

22

 MR. BASH: 

Well, to help make the crime 

23

succeed.  And I think a reasonable person reading that 

24

would not think I helped make  helped make the 924(c) 

25

crime succeed if I didn't even know about the gun until

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I was after doing  I was done doing whatever I was 

2

going to do. 

3

 And I also point the Court to page 194, 

4

which makes clear that "knowingly," in that second part 

5

of the instruction, is defined as voluntarily and 

6

intentionally.  So you certainly had to intentionally 

7

participate in the drug trafficking crime.  And that 

8

part of the context, as this Court has said, is also 

9

just 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Knowing that a gun would 

11

be used.  You had to intentionally participate knowing 

12

that a gun would be used. 

13

 MR. BASH: 

Basically a slight tweak, which 

14

is knowing that the principal bore the intent to use a 

15

gun.  Obviously, you can't know the future.  It's that 

16

you know that the principal bore that intent, which is a 

17

little bit different, but I think we're saying the same 

18

thing. 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I  I don't see how 

20

"make the crime succeed" helps you because you would say

the crime that he has to help make succeed is the 

22

underlying drug offense, not the use of the firearm. 

23

 MR. BASH: 

No, Mr. Chief Justice, we 

24

wouldn't say that.  This umbrella instruction applied to 

25

Count 1 and 2.  The crime you're help making succeed is

51

Alderson Reporting Company

924(c).  What I was saying earlier was that, what does 

2

it mean to help make a crime succeed?  It makes  it 

3

means intent to make one  at least one step in that 

4

crime easier, knowing the other person bore the intent 

5

to do the crime. 

6

 And I think that's how we normally think 

7

about it.  If there's an armed robbery, and you say, 

8

well, I'll drive the getaway car, I think you would 

9

naturally say in ordinary English you intended to help 

10

make that crime succeed even if you didn't bear a 

11

specific intent with respect to the gun. 

12

 I certainly think on  you know, if this 

13

had been objected to below, it might be a different 

14

matter with Mr. Elwood, but he did not object to this 

15

below.  He didn't  he didn't raise this  this 

16

wording issue even in the court of appeals.  He raised a 

17

sufficiency challenge with respect to foreknowledge. 

18

But he  even in his court of appeals brief, he didn't 

19

say that the instructions in this case were wrong 

20

because it said "used" versus "would use." 

21

 So I don't think the issue is properly here, 

22

but I think it would be a sensible resolution if the 

23

Court were to remand these casespecific issues after 

24

clarifying the basic standard of aiding and abetting to 

25

the court of appeals to work through the forfeiture and

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD 

6

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

7

 MR. ELWOOD: 

8

 One point that I want to emphasize is a 

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

point made by Justice Kagan, which is that traditionally 

10

because the actus reus is relatively small for aiding 

11

and abetting cases, that is exactly why courts have 

12

adopted a standard of purposeful intent.  And they have 

13

said that because the act of an accomplice tends to be 

14

less harmful and tends to be more equivocal than that of 

15

the principal, that they ordinarily require purposeful 

16

intent. 

17

 And as Professor Wayne LaFave said, who 

18

obviously doesn't have a stake in the case:  "Liability 

19

has seldom been imposed on the basis of knowing 

20

assistance.  The background rule is that it has to be 

21

purposeful intent." 

22
23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What cases should I look up 

for that? 

24

 MR. ELWOOD: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think 
That is to say, I thought

53

generally in the criminal law a person who commits an 

2

illegal act is liable for the known consequences of that 

3

act.  That is the general rule.  I can't think  I 

4

mean, people use all kinds of terminology, different 

5

kinds of terminology, but I thought that's the basic

principle.

 MR. ELWOOD: 

It was his purpose for doing 

it.  And the cases you can look at are Nye & Nissen 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well just tell me 

where in the brief they are, or whatever's easier. 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

I mean, Nye & Nissen, the 

19

Nye & Nissen, which is a case of this Court from 1949, 

20

where the Court adopted the standard from the Learned 

21

Hand case Peoni, that adopted the purposeful intent standard. 

22

And Peoni is obviously a very important case as well. 

23

 But Hicks. 

In Hicks, in 1893 this Court 

24

reversed a conviction because the jury instruction did 

25

not require proof of intent to encourage the crime.

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's language.  I am sure

action will occur is not liable for it.

LaFave. 
LaFave, Wayne LaFave. 
LaFave. 
Counsel, do you have 

anything for us on Rule 30? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

You know, on Rule 30, I won't 

pretend that it was a model of clarity in preserving the 

10

error about afterarising intent.  But I will say that 

11

there is no contest.  I mean, that is to us just a sign 

12

of how messed up the jury instructions are.  But we did 

13

preserve, we say, our objection both with respect to the 

14

absence of facilitating the right offense, and the 

15

intent to commit the crime as opposed to knowledge that 

16

the gun would be used.  And so 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18
19

How did you preserve 

that objection? 
 MR. ELWOOD: 

With respect to intent, by 

20

objecting to their instruction on the basis that it 

21

didn't include intentional facilitation of the 924(c) 

22

offense. 

23

 And if there are no further questions, we 

24

will rely on our submission.
