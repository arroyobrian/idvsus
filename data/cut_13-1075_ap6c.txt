 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

States v. June.

 Ms. Prelogar. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH PRELOGAR 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 There is good reason to believe that 

12

Congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to 

13

apply to the FTCA time bar, and I'd like to begin by 

14

focusing on a few of the issues that arose last hour 

15

that are particularly important to understanding 

16

Congress's intent. 

17

 To start with the questions, Justice Scalia 

18

and Justice Kagan, that you were asking at the end about 

19

the nature of our rule and what separates this statute 

20

from other statutes.  I want to be very clear:  We're 

21

not urging a categorical rule about all preIrwin 

22

statutes.  Here, we have statutespecific evidence about 

23

the FTCA that makes clear that Congress did not want 

24

this particular enactment to be subject to equitable 

25

tolling.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

 And that's most clear, of course, from the 

2

plain text and those 12 words, "Every claim against the 

3

United States cognizable shall be forever barred 

4

unless," that was lifted, Justice Scalia, as you said 

5

verbatim from the Tucker Act context where it had been 

6

repeatedly interpreted as a jurisdictional limit not 

7

subject to tolling. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Ms. 
You don't doubt that 

10

if  if those words appeared in a statute that Congress 

11

passed tomorrow, we would not interpret them as a 

12

jurisdictional bar, would we? 

13

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it 

14

would depend on whether there was an indication that 

15

Congress was intending to incorporate those words from 

16

the Tucker Act context. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought at least if a 

18

statute passed tomorrow, we have the clear statement 

19

rule that we have said  we have told Congress if you 

20

don't want to have any tolling, if you want this to be 

21

jurisdictional, absolutely rigid, you say so, and of 

22

course, Congress, it's your call.  But we're not going 

23

to interpret a statute that doesn't make that clear 

24

statement as jurisdiction. 

25

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

But this Court has also

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

emphasized, Justice Ginsburg, that there are no magic 

2

words that are required in this context.  And I think 

3

Bowles v. Russell makes that particularly clear.  There, 

4

those words, "shall" and "notice of appeal," were 

5

interpreted to have jurisdictional import.  And so to 

6

here in this context 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Because this Court had 

8

before  had before said that provision about how much 

9

time you have to appeal, that that was jurisdictional. 

10

And I thought the Court's position was we decided it 

11

once, and we're going to stick with it.  But if we 

12

haven't decided it, then we look at it.  We look for a 

13

clear statement. 

14

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

It was not only Section 2107 

15

in  in that context, but also predecessor provisions 

16

and other similar statutory requirements.  And that's 

17

what the Court said in Henderson, when a long line of 

18

this Court's decisions interpreting similar requirements 

19

have said that those requirements are jurisdictional, 

20

then we'll presume that Congress intended the same 

21

meaning.  Here, we have the identical language that had 

22

that jurisdictional label attached to it.  And that's 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I don't  I don't quite 

24

get the identical language because "shall be barred," I 

25

mean, that's common to a lot of statute of limitations.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

You're not suggesting that this would be different if it 

2

just said "shall be barred" rather than "forever 

3

barred," are you? 

4

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

No.  We're saying that when 

5

Congress lifted and incorporated word for word the 

6

thenprevailing Tucker Act time bar, it clearly was 

7

signaling an intent to incorporate the judicial 

8

interpretations of that Tucker Act time bar. 

9

 And  and, Justice Ginsburg, I  I think 

10

this is an important point about those early Tucker Act 

11

cases.  Those were not driveby jurisdictional rulings. 

12

Those were carefully considered decisions that attached 

13

jurisdictional consequences to the  the Tucker Act 

14

time bar and said that it couldn't be waived.  It wasn't 

15

subject to equitable tolling. 

16

 So this wasn't a  an argument that was 

17

made in passing or something that the Court didn't 

18

carefully consider.  Rather, the Court made a  a 

19

decision in those cases that that language had 

20

jurisdictional import. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms.  Ms. Prelogar, I'm 

22

wondering what you think about Mr. Schnapper's analogy 

23

to the private right of action cases, because it seems 

24

to me very similar is that we're dealing in an area here 

25

in which Congress doesn't generally say what it wants

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

with respect to some kind of procedural rule, maybe 

2

because Congress doesn't usually think about it. 

3

 And we have one set of interpretative rules 

4

to deal with that situation, and then those 

5

interpretative rules basically switch off and we get the 

6

opposite set of interpretative rules.  And the way it's 

7

worked in the private right of action cases, we don't 

8

look back and say, well, gosh, you were enacting this 

9

statute in the world of Cort v. Ash, and you used 

10

language that was identical to language that the Court 

11

assumed gave rise to a private right of action there, 

12

and so you get a private right of action, too. 

13

 We've not said that. 

We've said, you know, 

14

now we're in a different world and we're going to 

15

require more of you than what the old  than the old 

16

language that gave rise to a private right of action 

17

under Cort.  Why is this any different? 

18

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Justice Kagan, this Court has 

19

said in the implied private right of action context that 

20

you have to look at the contemporary legal context. 

21

That was the Cannon case that we cite in our opening 

22

brief and our reply brief.  And this Court, in Alexander 

23

v. Sandoval, made clear that  that those holdings 

24

hinged on the fact that Congress had acquiesced in the 

25

decision that had prevailed at the governing time.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

Were  were those 
Didn't our cases 
 were those two cases 

pre or  that you just cited pre or postIrwin? 
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Well, I was talking about the 

private right of action cases, Justice Kennedy. 
 So with respect to statutes that  that 

8

predate Irwin, if you actually look at how Irwin has 

9

fared and what the Irwin scorecard is, more often than 

10

not, this Court has held that there isn't equitable 

11

tolling in suits against the government.  The Court's 

12

considered that in five cases, and in four of them, 

13

Brockamp, Beggerly, John R. Sand & Gravel, and Auburn 

14

Regional Medical Center, it's held that the presumption, 

15

if it applies, is rebutted.  So I think 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Didn't  didn't the 

17

private right of action cases suggest rather strongly 

18

that Cort v. Ash was wrong?  That the prior notion that 

19

when Congress says nothing about it, there is an implied 

20

cause of action was wrong? 

21

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's true, Justice Scalia. 
And have we  have we said 

23

that prior notions of what Congress meant in the past 

24

about jurisdiction were wrong at the time? 

25

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

No, not at all.  And I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

4

that is 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So I don't think the two 

are parallel at all. 
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

And it's an important point 

5

here that there's no question that when Congress was 

6

enacting the FTCA in 1946 and at all relevant times 

7

thereafter, when it was making changes to this time bar, 

8

it  it did view that as a jurisdictional limit, and 

9

the Court has never questioned that  that historical 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That was  that was the 

11

way everything was  involving the government and 

12

sovereign immunity was all, quote, "jurisdictional." 

13

 And then we said  and if  if Congress 

14

made a statute, we said, well, we call that 

15

jurisdictional.  Congress never called it 

16

jurisdictional. 

17

 Then we took a fresh look at this, and we 

18

said that's  that's an exorbitant use of the word 

19

"jurisdiction."  Sure, you can have a  you can have a 

20

statute that has a very tight time line; that doesn't 

21

mean it's jurisdictional. 

22

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Justice Ginsburg, let me 

23

respond to that by  by taking a moment to emphasize 

24

the history of the FTCA, because I think it's perfectly 

25

clear that Congress at every turn, at every relevant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

historical juncture, signaled its approval of the view 

2

that this time bar was jurisdictional and could not be 

3

tolled. 

4

 Congress has made significant changes to the 

5

time bar four times:  In 1946, 1949, 1966 and 1988.  And 

6

at each of those times, Congress's words and actions 

7

were either inconsistent with or unnecessary in light of 

8

an equitable tolling doctrine. 

9

 I could just tick through them. 

In 1946, 

10

Congress enacted the FTCA time bar and expressly 

11

declined to include a tolling provision, even though it 

12

had considered earlier bills that did include that kind 

13

of tolling provision, which, as this Court has said, it 

14

was a deliberate choice, rather than an inadvertent 

15

omission. 

16

 In 1949 Congress was aware that there had 

17

been individual cases of hardship and debated in one of 

18

the hearings whether to create a reasonable cause 

19

exception.  Instead of doing so, Congress decided to 

20

extend the deadline from 1 year to 2, which would have 

21

been unnecessary if equitable tolling could take care of 

22

the hardship. 

23

 1966 is particularly important because at 

24

that point there were 2 decades of experience with the 

25

FTCA and every lower court to consider the issue had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

held that it was jurisdictional and not subject to 

2

tolling.  Congress was aware of those decisions because 

3

repeatedly litigants came to it during that time period 

4

and requested relief in the form of a private bill.  And 

5

there, Justice Ginsburg, Congress did use that magic 

6

word "jurisdictional."  Congress repeatedly  granted 

7

relief through private laws that conferred jurisdiction 

8

on district courts notwithstanding the time bar in 

9

Section 2401(b). 

10

 Finally, in the 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

12
13

Well, it was responding 

to our cases that use "jurisdiction." 
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

And acquiescing in those 

14

cases, I would argue, when Congress then, in 1966, 

15

reenacted the time bar without making any material 

16

change.  Congress was aware that this is how courts were 

17

interpreting the  interpreting the time bar, and this 

18

Court itself had just recently announced in Soriano that 

19

the Tucker Act time bar and that language was 

20

jurisdictional, not subject to tolling, and  and Congress 

21

acted in reliance on those decisions when it reenacted 

22

the bar in '66. 

23

 Finally, in 1988, this was when Congress 

24

enacted the Westfall Act.  At that point in time there 

25

was a particular situation of hardship that had arisen

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

when a claimant had sued a Federal employee and then the 

2

United States was substituted as a defendant after the 

3

time had run to present a claim to the administrative 

4

agency. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Ms. Prelogar, I do think 

6

that the  the other side's account, at Mr. Schnapper's 

7

account of the Westfall Act, the one that Congress was 

8

intending to benefit was not the plaintiff, not the 

9

injured plaintiff.  It was the Federal employee, because 

10

until Westfall v. Erwin, the Federal employee was off 

11

the hook.  He wasn't  so then when this Court, said, 

12

Federal employee, you are going to be stuck, then 

13

Congress passed a relief measure for the Federal 

14

employee, not  not the plaintiff. 

15

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

It's absolutely the case, 

16

Justice Ginsburg, that that was the overall purpose of 

17

the Westfall Act.  But Congress included 

18

Section 2679(d)(5), which was the provision that gave 

19

the claimant extra time to present a claim, 60 extra 

20

days, if the claimant was out of luck because the time 

21

of the statute had run by the time the United States was 

22

substituted as a defendant.  And that exception that 

23

Congress introduced in 1988 would have been entirely 

24

unnecessary if Congress thought that courts could take 

25

care of this on a casebycase basis through equitable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1
2
3
4

tolling. 
 So I think that the historical story here is 
consistent and it's clear.  At every turn 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You are equating 

5

reasonable cause or  or something comparable with 

6

equitable tolling.  Equitable tolling, as Justice 

7

Ginsburg pointed out earlier, is much harder to get. 

8
9

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

That's absolutely true, 

Justice Sotomayor, that it might be hard to get it in an 

10

individual case.  But  but I think that it's clear, 

11

and this again comes from the Tucker Act line of cases, 

12

that Congress did view this as a  a strict limit on 

13

the waiver of sovereign immunity, and that Congress had 

14

a right to suggest that it didn't even want to extend 

15

that waiver one bit more. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could I ask a question? 

17

You've both been arguing this as if your situations are 

18

identical.  But do you disagree with the Respondent here 

19

who says that  who characterizes the administrative 

20

claim process under the FTCA as claimant friendly? 

21

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Certainly that process is 

22

claimant friendly, but when the Court has emphasized 

23

that concern in other cases, and I'm thinking here of 

24

Bowen and Henderson, the Court was looking specifically 

25

at the time bar and whether it was claimant friendly.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

 In Bowen, the time bar itself had a 

2

provision that allowed the secretary to extend out the 

3

limit for appealing a Social Security benefits denial, 

4

and the secretary had interpreted that to encompass 

5

principles of equity and fairness. 

6

 In Henderson, when the Court emphasized the 

7

claimantfriendly nature of the procedural posture of 

8

that case, the Court emphasized that there was no time 

9

limit at all for a veteran to present his claim. 

10

 So in those cases it was the time bar that 

11

was claimant friendly.  And here we don't have that at 

12

all.  We have a strict, absolute limit that has no  no 

13

space within the text to permit any  any notions of 

14

claimant friendliness.  So I think that is a relevant 

15

distinction between those cases where it has made a 

16

difference and where it has not. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Prelogar, I asked 

18

Mr. Martinez a question before and, to tell you the 

19

truth, I've just forgotten his answer to it, so I'm 

20

going to ask you.  How about 2401(a)? 

21

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

The government's position is 

22

that 2401(a) is jurisdictional, but I want to say at the 

23

outset that each statute has to be interpreted on its 

24

own terms 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, why is 2401(a)

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

jurisdictional if every statute has to be  you know, 

2

Mr. Martinez said it's those exact 12 words, and 2401(a) 

3

doesn't have those exact 12 words. 

4

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

2401(a) originated in the 

5

Tucker Act itself in 1887 and, based on that Tucker Act 

6

historical pedigree, we think that the same 

7

interpretation of it that was longstanding would 

8

would govern here in this context.  So that 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is there  is there any 

10

statute of limitations that applies against the Federal 

11

government that you don't think is jurisdictional? 

12

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Other than the ones that this 

13

Court has  has already ruled upon, I can't think of 

14

any off the top of my head.  But I have to confess that 

15

I haven't done an extensive statutespecific analysis 

16

with respect to all of them. 

17
18
19
20
21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, if that  if that's 

all 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Have you stopped beating 

your husband, right? 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If, in fact  you've heard 

22

this already, but I'd like your specific answer to it. 

23

In Irwin, Chief Justice Rehnquist says, we  a 

24

waiver of  they are holding a new rule.  He says that. 

25

He says that we now  a waiver of sovereign immunity

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

cannot be implied, but must be express.  Once Congress 

2

has made such a waiver, all right, we think that making 

3

the rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits 

4

against the government in the same way that it is 

5

applicable to private suits amounts to little 

6

broadening.  Such a principle  da, da, da  and 

7

that's what we hold. 

8
9
10

 Now, has not the Court, I'm not sure, 
applied Irwin to statutes that were enacted before 
Irwin? 

11

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It has, Justice 
Now, if, in fact, we were 

13

to hold with you in this, how would we justify that?  I 

14

mean, this is a statute that  that, as much as any, is 

15

trying to equate  waives sovereign immunity, trying to 

16

equate private suits against private people with suits 

17

against the government.  So if some times Irwin applies 

18

to a preIrwin statute, when no one in Congress thought 

19

that they would be doing that, why isn't this case in 

20

that? 

21

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, let me be 
I know you've given many, 

23

many answers, but the answers that I hear are all 

24

answers that Congress at the time probably thought that 

25

equitable tolling wouldn't apply.  I agree.  That is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

probably what they thought, if they thought about it. 

2

But the same is probably true of dozens of statutes that 

3

were passed preIrwin. 

4

 So what's the distinction? 

Because 

5

Rehnquist says we now are laying down  we think this 

6

case affords us an opportunity to adopt a more general 

7

rule.  He thinks he is applying a new rule.  And  and 

8

that's applying to prior statutes.  So why not this one 

9

if it's any? 

10

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Irwin adopted that rule 

11

because it judged it to be a realistic assessment of 

12

legislative intent.  But Irwin made clear that it's a 

13

rebuttable presumption.  As this Court said in John R. 

14

Sand & Gravel, it's not conclusive, and it can be 

15

over 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I agree with you that Irwin 

17

does say it is likely to be a realistic assessment of 

18

legislative intent.  That is one reason given among 

19

others.  If I don't agree with you, that that was meant 

20

to be absolute rather than simply a factor in the mind 

21

run of cases, suppose I don't accept your argument 

22

there, then I would have to apply it to this statute; 

23

right. 

24
25

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

And we agree that the 

presumption applies at the outset.  At the threshold the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1
2

government has the burden 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I know, and what you're 

3

saying is that there are certain things that rebut it. 

4

But all those things, it seems to me, come down to 

5

saying, as I just said, that Congress, at the time, 

6

thought there wouldn't be equitable tolling.  And that's 

7

why I asked this question.  That would seem to me to be 

8

true of many statutes, if not all of them, passed before 

9

Irwin, and yet we have applied Irwin backwards. 

10

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

It may well be, Justice 

11

Breyer, that it's easier for the government to rebut the 

12

presumption with respect to preIrwin statutes because, 

13

of course, under Irwin this Court does have to consider 

14

what the prevailing and contemporary legal context was 

15

at the time the statute was enacted.  Holland makes that 

16

clear where it suggests that the presumption has greater 

17

force as applied to statutes enacted after Irwin. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But every statute that it 

19

applied to in Irwin was enacted, how many years, 18 

20

years before Irwin. 

21

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

In 1972.  That's correct, 

22

Justice Ginsburg.  Of course, there is a relevant change 

23

in the law that happened in that time period.  In 1967 

24

 this is, of course, after the FTCA had been reenacted 

25

 this Court decided Honda v. Clark.  That was the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

first decision holding that there could be equitable 

2

tolling in a suit against the government.  And so, by 

3

the time Congress enacted Title VII in 1970 in 1972, it was 

4

legislating against a backdrop where there wasn't a 

5

uniform line of precedence from this Court saying that 

6

every statute waiving sovereign immunity was  was necessarily 

7

subject to tolling. 

8

 I think the important point here  and this 

9

comes from Honda v. Clark as well  is an observation 

10

about ­ about the mode of statutory interpretation that we're 

11

urging.  In Honda v. Clark the reason the Court reached 

12

that conclusion that there could be equitable tolling 

13

notwithstanding the sovereign immunity considerations, 

14

is because the statute in that case, the Trading with 

15

the Enemy Act, had been expressly patterned after the 

16

Federal Bankruptcy Act.  And this Court said that lower 

17

courts had interpreted the Bankruptcy Act to permit 

18

equitable tolling.  And so, the Court said that the 

19

Trading with the Enemy Act should be interpreted the 

20

same way. 

21

 That's precisely the argument we're making 

22

here.  It's an argument about how Congress would have 

23

understood these words when it took them directly from 

24

the Tucker Act context and imported them into the FTCA. 

25

 I would like to make a brief observation

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

about respondent's primary effort to distinguish the 

2

Tucker Act cases.  And  and this is the distinction that 

3

respondent draws between the court of claims and 

4

district courts. 

5

 Respondent says that those tribunals 

6

exercise fundamentally different powers when it comes to 

7

equitable tolling.  But that would radically alter how 

8

this Court has long understood the court of claims' 

9

powers.  As we explained in our reply brief, all of 

10

respondent's cases deal with the issue of equitable 

11

remedies.  Whether the court of claims can issue an 

12

injunction.  No, it can't, but that's also true of 

13

district courts applying FTCA claims.  There the 

14

district court is only considering a claim for money 

15

damages. 

16

 And the important point is this Court has 

17

never distinguished between the powers of the court of 

18

claims and powers of district courts with respect to 

19

equitable doctrines, equitable recoupment, equitable 

20

reformation of a contract, the equitable doctrines of 

21

latches and estoppel.  Down the line, the Court has 

22

indicated that the court of claims has those powers 

23

equally with district courts. 

24
25

 So there is simply no tenable basis to say 
that that tribunalfocused analysis creates a difference

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

between the presumptions that should apply with respect 

2

to equitable tolling.  It also doesn't do anything to 

3

explain this Court's Tucker Act cases.  If, in fact, 

4

respondent were right and this was a function of the 

5

tribunal, then what this Court could have said in those 

6

cases is, here is a statute administered by the court of 

7

claims; thus, there's no equatable tolling. 

8

 But, of course, that's not what this Court 

9

did in Kendall, Finn, Soriano, John R. Sand & Gravel, 

10

the entire line of cases.  Instead, those cases turned 

11

on the text of the time bar and the fact that this was a 

12

waiver of sovereign immunity and that Congress intended 

13

that waiver to be interpreted narrowly. 

14

 And  and, Justice Breyer, to your point about how 

15

equitable tolling rarely applies  Justice Ginsburg, I 

16

think you mentioned this as well  I do think it's 

17

important to look at this historical context and what 

18

this meant for Congress in 1946.  And by today's light 

19

it's not a particularly big deal to sue the United 

20

States in its own name for money damages, but when 

21

Congress enacted the statute in 1946 it was an 

22

incredibly big deal.  And, in fact, it took Congress two 

23

decades of debating this bill to even grow comfortable 

24

with the idea and to get everyone on board with waiving 

25

the sovereign immunity of the United States for tort

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

actions. 

2

 The Federal government was out ahead of the 

3

states in this.  The house report that accompanies the 

4

1946 legislation notes only four states that had waived 

5

their sovereign immunity for tort claims.  By 1969, it 

6

was only 17 states that had fully waived their sovereign 

7

immunity, only four of which, by the way, permitted any 

8

form of tolling. 

9

 So I think it's pretty clear that when you 

10

look at the statute and you look at what Congress 

11

intended in 1946, those were the factors that motivated 

12

it, this was a strict condition on the waiver of 

13

sovereign immunity and Congress intended it to be 

14

interpreted narrowly. 

15
16

 If there are no further questions I would 
like to reserve the remainder of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 Mr. Rosenkranz.

23

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 
 All of the arguments that you heard in Wong 

24

apply with equal force to our case; that is, Mr. 

25

Schnapper's  arguments.  But they apply with extra force

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

with respect to the administrative presentment 

2

requirement.  And the inclusion now of an administrative 

3

presentment requirement actually sheds some light on 

4

what Congress must have meant with respect to the filing 

5

provisions.  So there are additional reasons with 

6

respect to administrative presentment, and a lot of the 

7

arguments that the government has been making, 

8

particularly in the first argument in Wong, simply don't 

9

apply to 1966 or to administrative presentment. 

10

 So Ms. Prelogar says 1966 was important. 

It 

11

was important.  As of 1966, this scheme looked like a 

12

completely different scheme from the scheme that 

13

Congress passed in 1946.  The Tucker Act, the suit 

14

filing deadline runs from accrual.  There's no 

15

presentment requirement.  The statute of limitations for 

16

filing a lawsuit is six years from accrual.  There are 

17

statutory disability provisions.  FTCA, the suitfiling 

18

deadline now runs from an agency action, from the final 

19

determination.  Presentment is required.  The statute of 

20

limitations for filing the lawsuit is now six months 

21

from the agency action and there are no listed 

22

exceptions. 

23

 Now, the context is fundamentally different 

24

than for the presentment provision and now for the 

25

entire FTCA statute of limitations, but let me just talk

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

first about presentment.  So the central  first of 

2

all, the central focus of presentment is informality, is 

3

flexibility.  You fill out a oneandahalf page form. 

4

You literally handwrite into little boxes.  It takes 30 

5

minutes to fill out.  If you send it to the wrong 

6

agency, no big deal.  The Department of Justice sends it 

7

on to the right agency.  And the administrative process 

8

that is triggered by that filing is not what anyone 

9

would view as an adjudication.  The statute says it's 

10

about settlement, it's about negotiations.  To Justice 

11

Breyer's point, you're usually unrepresented by counsel. 

12

And the notion  and DOJ says specifically in its 

13

regulations that what is supposed to happen are, 

14

"Informal discussions, negotiations and settlement 

15

rather than any formal or structured process." 

16

 The notion of applying a rigid, indeed 

17

jurisdictional rule to that very informal process, flies 

18

in the face of the whole informality that Congress set 

19

up for the suitinitiating process. 

20

 Secondly 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And without need to say, 

22

there were no prior cases talking about whether this was 

23

equitable tolling under the Tucker Act because there was 

24

no such thing. 

25

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

That is exactly right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

The  the presentment requirements all came into play 

2

in the '60s.  They were never applied to the Tucker Act. 

3

This was part of a spate of new law so the backdrop law 

4

against which this is being interpreted, all we have 

5

now, not when Congress passed it, but all we have now is 

6

Zipes. 

7

 Now, all of the  all of the criteria that 

8

I was ticking off as to what the statute of limitations 

9

looked like, it looks like Title VII.  In Zipes this 

10

Court tells us  that is the statute of limitations in 

11

Title VII  in Zipes this Court tells us that the 

12

presentment requirement is not subject to equitable 

13

tolling.  So that's the second point 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Rosenkranz, so I 

15

understand you, are you arguing that tolling applies to 

16

the presentment provision even though it doesn't apply 

17

to other provisions? 

18

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

No, Your Honor. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is it possible for us to 

20

hold that? 

21

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

That is not what I'm 

22

arguing, Your Honor.  What I'm arguing is tolling has 

23

always applied, certainly, to this statute, certainly 

24

under Irwin for reasons that I will explain in a little 

25

bit.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

 But when Congress reenacts this in 1966, it 

2

makes abundantly clear that that conclusion is correct. 

3

Because now we've got this presentment requirement, 

4

which I think refreshes congressional intent with 

5

respect to what it was thinking on jurisdiction. 

6

 But  but I will circle back to this in a 

7

moment as I said, but I agree with everything Mr. 

8

Schnapper said.  In 1946 it was also not jurisdictional 

9

for the 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't know what you mean 

11

by "refreshes congressional intent."  We have a fairly 

12

rigid doctrine that repeals by implication are not 

13

favored.  And are you saying that intent was "refreshed" 

14

so that even if Congress originally thought this was 

15

jurisdictional in the narrow sense, it now no longer is 

16

because of the adoption of the presentment provision? 

17

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

I am not, Justice Scalia. 

18

Let me just be clear.  Our position is from 1946 on, it 

19

has always been subject to equitable tolling, it has 

20

never been jurisdictional.  But to the extent that 

21

anyone doubts that  because as Justice Alito points 

22

out, Congress wasn't thinking about any of this, so all 

23

we are talking about is a battle of presumptions.  We 

24

have two clear statement rules. 

25

 And I grant you, Justice Scalia that there's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

also another clear statement rule with respect  or 

2

another presumption, that is, with respect to choosing 

3

language from another source, which I will also get to 

4

in a moment, but let me just, if I may, finish on 

5

presentment. 

6

 The third point I was going to make is that 

7

as originally drafted, this presentment requirement was 

8

never a requirement.  It was in the original FTCA.  It 

9

was permissive.  So with respect to repeals by 

10

implication, what happens next is Congress makes it a 

11

requirement.  And the presumption then, or the 

12

Government's position then, as I understand it, is, when 

13

Congress turned it in  turned it from permissive to a 

14

requirement, Congress also made that requirement both 

15

jurisdictional and impervious to the ageold doctrine of 

16

equitable tolling. 

17

 Next point, this Court has never ever found 

18

that an administrative presentment provision is 

19

jurisdictional or overcomes the presumption in favor of 

20

equitable tolling.  And that really is a version of the 

21

point that Justice Sotomayor was making. 

22

 Fourth, it is at least relevant that the 

23

statute here runs from accrual and not from some hard 

24

and fast point.  And the  the Government is making 

25

this argument that our fraudulent concealment point is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

really an accrual point.  Well, if it is, then that 

2

means that the same conversations one would have about 

3

fraudulent concealment one would have about accrual 

4

anyway. 

5

 So I  I kept promising that I was going to 

6

go back to the baseline points, and the baseline 

7

points 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Rosenkranz, in that 

regard, would you clarify what is the Government's 

10

what is your position in response to the Government's 

11

rather strong answer to your suggestion that equity was 

12

foreign to the claims court? 

13

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, yes, Your Honor. 

14

First, let me begin by saying that our basic position is 

15

that  that the presumption exists that Irwin was a sea 

16

change in the law, that Irwin changes things as to every 

17

other statute moving forward.  But we've also ticked off 

18

a series of differences between the Federal Tort Claims 

19

Act and the Tucker Act, and this difference in forum was 

20

one of them. 

21

 So from the start, and I mean 1863, the 

22

the claims court was just a very different body from a 

23

district court.  Congress viewed it really as an arm of 

24

Congress at first and then it got adjudicatory powers, 

25

but it didn't have, in 1863 when Congress passed the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

statute and in the 1870s, '80s and into the early 20th 

2

Century when this Court was interpreting the statute, 

3

the court of claims just simply did not have equitable 

4

powers.  This Court said it in Bowen.  "The claims court 

5

does not have the general equitable powers of a district 

6

court." 

7

 Now, the Government cites several cases 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9
10
11

You  you contradict the 

Government on that point.  I'm sure the Government said 
just the opposite. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

The Government did say just 

12

the opposite and the Government cites several cases. 

13

Now, it is telling 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It didn't say the 

15

opposite.  It said the claims court didn't have the 

16

authority to give equitable remedies.  It didn't have 

17

the authority to enjoin.  But from the beginning it had 

18

equitable doctrine as part of its 

19

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Agreed, Your Honor.  The 

20

Government has taken the opposite position from what I'm 

21

saying with respect to whether the court of claims from 

22

the start had broad equitable powers putting aside 

23

injunctions. 

24
25

 And my point is, the first case that the 
Government cites is 50 years after the court of claims

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

was created.  By that point, the jurisdictional train 

2

had left the station.  Kendall had been decided, Finn 

3

had been decided.  It was already set in stone that this 

4

was a court whose  for whom the statute of limitations 

5

was jurisdictional. 

6

 Now, the cases the Government sites, its 

7

best case is Bowles v. United States, that's already 

8

1935, I mean, that's many, many years later.  And not a 

9

single one of those cases, including Bowles, ever 

10

creates a casebycase equitable sort of claimant by 

11

claimant analysis of the sort that equitable 

12

tolling involves. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you say they are 

14

later cases but they didn't say the law has changed from 

15

what it used to be; did they?  Didn't they purport to 

16

say that the court of claims had always had that power? 

17

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, they didn't purport 

18

to say it but they did say the court of claims currently 

19

has that power, and I grant you that I'm  that that 

20

may sound like splitting hairs, but we're trying to 

21

we're trying to get behind what this Court was doing 

22

back in the 1870s and 1880s.  And I'll just emphasize, 

23

several of the cases that the Government cites, are 

24

cases in which what the court of claims does looks like 

25

the result is equitable, but what this Court held was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

that equity had nothing to do with why this Court 

2

approved what the court of claims did.  But rather, this 

3

Court was saying the powers that the court of claims was 

4

exercising were actually in the statute. 

5

 So Milligan is a particularly striking 

6

example.  This Court said that the court of claims 

7

action with which the Government chalks up to equity, 

8

actually quote, "Seems to us to fall within these words" 

9

that is, the words of the Tucker Act  quote "in their 

10
11
12
13

obvious and literal sense." 
 But I don't want to dwell too much on the 
difference between the forums because 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, if I could 

14

just pause there, I mean, obviously I'll go back and 

15

reread Bowles.  But in Bowles they said the money should 

16

be returned because it offended principles of natural 

17

justice and equity. 

18

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

20
21

Yes, Your Honor. 
It doesn't sound 

like something in the statute. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

22

what was going on in Bowles was also not 

23

claimantbyclaimant decisions, it was sort of a broad 

24

class of claimants.  And I agree with you.  That is the 

25

one  that is the closest case to what the Government's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1
2

position is. 
 But those other cases are, to the extent 

3

that the court of claims is exercising what looks like 

4

equity, it's always in favor of the Government.  Which 

5

is consistent with the manner in which the court of 

6

claims was born.  It was intended to be a parsimonious 

7

doler out of government funds. 

8
9

 So I want to turn, though, for a moment to 
the proposition that this is just a wholesale 

10

withdrawal  excuse me, a wholesale adoption of the 

11

Federal Tort Claims Act plunked into a  excuse me, a 

12

wholesale adoption of the Tucker Act plunked into a new 

13

framework, a  a new statute.  It is not.  Certainly 

14

not in 1966 for the reasons that I've described, but 

15

also not in 1946. 

16

 First, I've already mentioned this forum 

17

distinction.  Secondly, there are  there is a 

18

distinction and Congress understood there to be a 

19

distinction between torts and contract claims  on the 

20

one hand, and contract or takings claims on the other 

21

hand.  Contract claims and takings claims, even 

22

contracts, Federal contracts, are governed by Federal 

23

law. 

24
25

 Torts  this  the Congress made the 
decision that tort claims are going to be governed by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

State law and it adopted statutes of limitations that 

2

mimicked State law statutes of limitations.  That 

3

oneyear statute of limitations was an effort to try to 

4

mimic what States were doing.  And it changed to two 

5

years, Congress said, because it wanted to mimic what 

6

States were doing a little bit later. 

7

 And it's important to understand that the 

8

the State tort laws were always subject to equitable 

9

tolling.  The differences between a twoyear statute of 

10

limitations and a sixyear statute of limitations is 

11

is very considerable, especially when one brings to mind 

12

the sorts of considerations that Justice Breyer 

13

mentioned, that tort claimants are often  are often 

14

unrepresented. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Rosenkranz, may I 

16

interrupt you because I thought I heard Ms. Prelogar say 

17

that at the time that the FTCA was adopted, there were 

18

only four States that applied tolling. 

19

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

I  I don't  I don't 

20

believe that is true.  Equitable tolling has been a rule 

21

that courts  that courts have applied since the 1800s 

22

to all manner of  of claims.  Torts were no exception. 

23

And one of the reasons that States had such short 

24

statutes of limitations was precisely because equitable 

25

tolling provided a relief 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No.  She's  I'm not 

2

talking about their equitable tolling in tort cases. 

3

She's saying in waivers of sovereign immunity, tort 

4

claims against States, which is slightly different. 

5

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Oh, yes.  Yes, yes.  So 

6

so let me just rephrase what I understand the government 

7

to be arguing. 

8

 Those weren't equitable tolling provisions 

9

in statutes, as I understand the point the government is 

10

making, those are exceptions to statutes of limitations. 

11

They're rigid.  They look like the Tucker Act 

12

exceptions, but they're not case by case.  They are 

13

if you're overseas, as Mr. Schnapper said earlier 

14

actually, it doesn't matter whether you're monitoring 

15

the docket and you can fully preserve your  your 

16

claims, it's just sort of a flatout bar.  And those are 

17

the ones that  that I believe the government is 

18

speaking about. 

19

 Those are statutory. 

And as Mr. Schnapper 

20

pointed out, statutory exclusions from the statutes of 

21

limitations have always coexisted with equitable 

22

exclusions.  And I also 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you think, like 

24

Mr. Schnapper, that your way of looking at this would 

25

call into question McNeil v. U.S.?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

No, Your Honor.  And I 

2

don't think it calls into question McNeil v. U.S. at 

3

all.  So  and there are two pieces to the answer.  The 

4

first piece is, let's assume that McNeil was a 

5

jurisdictional ruling, which means that in order to 

6

present your  in order to file your lawsuit, you have 

7

to present your claim first to the agency. 

8
9

 Well, in order to file a lawsuit, in real 
outside of this context, you also have to file a 

10

complaint.  The filing of a complaint is jurisdictional, 

11

but that doesn't mean that the time limit for filing it 

12

is jurisdictional.  So too here, if indeed the filing of 

13

an administrative form  you know, this administrative 

14

presentment is jurisdictional, that doesn't mean that 

15

the  that the time limit for filing it is also 

16

jurisdictional. 

17

 But I said there were two halves. 

The 

18

second half is I agree with Mr. Schnapper, this Court 

19

came to a conclusion in McNeil.  The conclusion is you 

20

can't have your lawsuit without exhausting 

21

administrative remedies.  That was not stated as a 

22

jurisdictional ruling.  It was  it  it is analyzed 

23

much more like an exhaustion ruling, to my mind, which 

24

doesn't necessarily mean jurisdictional. 

25

 So I was beginning to tick off some of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

differences between the Federal Tort Claims Act and the 

2

Tucker Act, and I was talking about the differences in 

3

statutes of limitations, the differences in the nature 

4

of the forums, the differences in the nature of the law, 

5

and I want to come back to that last one. 

6

 The FTCA treats the government like a 

7

private individual.  It says it three times in the 

8

statute and it treats the government, to the Chief 

9

Justice's question, as a private individual with respect 

10

to liability.  So it's not with respect to all 

11

procedures that might come up, but it says with respect 

12

to liability.  Well, statutes of limitations dictate 

13

liability and the procedures attached to the statutes 

14

excuse me, the time limits attached to the statutes of 

15

limitations also affect liability. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I have  I have a 

17

question.  Why is it important to tie this presumption 

18

of jurisdiction or not to the 1946 Act?  I mean, why 

19

don't you just say that whatever presumptions existed of 

20

borrowing from the Tucker Act obviously changed in 1966. 

21

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That 
They changed the 

23

language, they changed the process.  I mean, do we need 

24

to go back?  Why  why not just say, whatever the 

25

presumptions were with respect to the jurisdictional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

nature in the Tucker Act in 1946, or even thereafter, 

2

got completely thrown out the window in 1966? 

3

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

That  that was indeed, 

4

Justice Sotomayor, my opening point.  And I've been 

5

making this argument 

6
7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But then you said I 

agree with Mr. Schnapper that since 1946 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

So  so I was making the 

argument to those like Justice Scalia, who reject our 
refreshment theory 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Okay. 
 and  and say, well, 

13

what about 1946?  And even in 1946, that if you apply 

14

the Irwin presumption, which this Court said in Irwin it 

15

would, you get the same result.  And that's  that's 

16

the fundamental point on the precedence that I want to 

17

make sure to emphasize. 

18

 Our argument is not that this is a living 

19

statute that blows in the wind with congressional 

20

intent.  Our argument is that Irwin made it clear that 

21

there is a sea change, that Soriano and all the cases 

22

dating back on the Tucker Act adopted a vision of what 

23

Congress must have intended that Irwin says is wrong. 

24

That is not what Congress intends just because it waives 

25

sovereign immunity.  And so 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I don't think 

2

it can be regarded as such a sea change because the 

3

basic principle is you're looking to legislative intent. 

4

And he said, the  the late Chief, that the realistic 

5

assessment of legislative intent is likely to be found 

6

based on the presumption.  Of course, you know, subject 

7

to rebuttal. 

8
9

 So that doesn't seem to me to be  the 
whole point is we think this is how best define 

10

legislative intent, and that I thought has always been 

11

the rule. 

12

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, that's always been 

13

the rule, Your Honor, in the private context and the 

14

government is now being put in the private context, but 

15

that was not always the rule with respect to the 

16

government and certainly not consistently because we 

17

have Soriano. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But, I mean, that 

19

was not a legislative intent.  The view was not that we 

20

think the presumption of legislative intent is  is no 

21

equitable tolling. 

22

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Oh, Your Honor, I  I beg 

23

to differ.  As I read Kendall and Finn, they didn't 

24

this Court did not use phrases like "presumption."  But 

25

what this Court did was to say Congress didn't say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

anything about this, but it was legislating against a 

2

backdrop of waiving sovereign immunity, and when 

3

Congress waives sovereign immunity, we have to read 

4

statutes in a particular way; we're going to read them 

5

very strictly. 

6

 Irwin says, no, that's not how we're going 

7

to read statutes, that the better way to read statutes 

8

is to assume the opposite, that Congress did not intend 

9

statutes of limitations to be jurisdictional.  And 

10

sure  and by the way, John R. Sands says, and I quote, 

11

"It was"  and I quote  "a turn in the course of the 

12

law," which now, quote, "places great weight upon the 

13

equitable importance of treating the government like 

14

other litigants and less weight on the special 

15

governmental interest in protecting public funds." 

16

Words that this Court, perhaps by accident, but  but 

17

almost took directly out of the Federal Tort Claims Act, 

18

treating the government like it treats other parties. 

19

 So  so Justice Scalia makes a powerful 

20

powerful point about a countervailing presumption.  But 

21

it is not  by which I mean it is another presumption, 

22

but it is a  it is an argument  that doesn't play out 

23

plainly in this context.  And the reason is, as was 

24

covered in quite a bit of detail earlier this morning, 

25

the notion of  of fixating on the words "forever

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

barred" or the eight or 12 words around it to the 

2

exclusion of the rest of the statute is just wrong. 

3

 The  there was no magic to the words 

4

"forever barred," not in 1863, not in 1946.  If you do a 

5

Westlaw search of forever barred, you will find scores 

6

of gardenvariety statutes of limitations that are 

7

structured exactly this way and that use the exact same 

8

words.  And that's the point Justice Kagan was pointing 

9

out, Professor Sick's  Sisk's brief at page 20 gives 

10

all sorts of examples.  Mr. Schnapper gave others.  The 

11

Fair Labor Standards Act is one.  The  the statutes or 

12

statute that this Court was interpreting in both Klehr 

13

and Rotella is another. 

14

 And then layer on top of that the fact that 

15

the Federal  that the Tucker Act no longer even has 

16

"forever barred" in the language, and still this Court 

17

says it bears the same meaning.  And it points out in 

18

in John R. Sand's that the change in language did not 

19

make a fundamental difference. 

20
21
22

 And as I was saying  oh, let me just make 
one more point on this. 
 In 1877, this Court, in a case called 

23

Sanger, which was also cited in Professor Sisk's brief, 

24

says that that very language, forever barred, is, quote, 

25

"an ordinary statute of limitations."

 So let me just pause and see if the Court 
has other questions that it wants to draw me to. 
 So if there are no further questions, we 

4

respectfully request that the Court affirm the court of 

5

appeals.  Thank you, Your Honors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel. 

remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH PRELOGAR 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

If I could just make three 

12

points.  First, with respect to the administrative 

13

presentment requirement in particular, I want to be very 

14

clear on this.  From the beginning, from 1946 forward, 

15

there was an optional administrative presentment 

16

procedure, and this appears in our brief at page 9a. 

17

This is the original text of the FTCA time bar, and it 

18

uses the very same operative language with respect to 

19

that administrative presentment option:  Every claim 

20

against the United States cognizable shall be forever 

21

barred unless.  So this is a procedure that has been in 

22

the FTCA from the very beginning. 

23

 In 1966, what Congress did is make that 

24

administrative presentment requirement mandatory.  But 

25

when it did so, it did so against the backdrop of every

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

lower court to consider the issue, holding that this 

2

language was jurisdictional, not subject to tolling.  It 

3

did so against the backdrop of Congress repeatedly, in 

4

the private bills, making clear that this was 

5

jurisdictional language and that it had to confer 

6

jurisdiction on district courts when plaintiffs were 

7

trying to proceed outside the time limits. 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Are you saying that the 

administrative process was jurisdictional?  I mean 
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Well, the administrative 

11

presentment requirement itself, of course, this Court 

12

had held  which it has held was jurisdictional in the 

13

McNeil case.  I'm not aware of  of lower courts in 

14

that time limit 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Did we use the language, 

"jurisdictional"? 
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

You affirmed for lack of 

18

jurisdiction, and I think that McNeil language does show 

19

that it's an absolute or strict deadline.  There is no 

20

room to any exception to it.  Every lower court has 

21

understood McNeil to be jurisdictional, and Congress, in 

22

1988, when it enacted the Westfall Act specifically said 

23

in  in the House report that the administrative 

24

exhaustion requirement was jurisdictional, which is why 

25

it created that  that narrow exception to permit an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

extra 60 days.  So I think it is clearly settled that 

2

the exhaustion requirement at this point is 

3

jurisdictional. 

4

 But the point that I was trying to make 

5

about the 1966 reenactment is there, against that 

6

consistent backdrop about what this language means, the 

7

language that Congress had used, Congress, to set forth 

8

a presentment requirement, used the same language once 

9

again and  and, therefore, intended it to have the 

10
11

same meaning. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, Mr. Rosenkranz 

12

tells us that that language is pretty typical for your 

13

ordinary, runofthemill statute of limitations.  It 

14

sounds pretty daunting, you know, forever barred, but 

15

apparently that's the normal language that's used. 

16

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

And it's absolutely the case, 

17

Mr. Chief Justice, that it is not "forever barred" 

18

itself that necessarily has magic import here.  It's the 

19

Tucker Act analogy, the fact that Congress got this 

20

language from the Tucker Act, and that in that context, 

21

which was a parallel context, it had interpreted to be 

22

jurisdictional which makes the difference here.  Every 

23

statute will have to be evaluated in light of not just 

24

the text but its context and history. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Are exactly the problem

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

because the  really the better language in Irwin is, 

2

again, the Chief Justice, "A continuing effort on our 

3

part to decide each case on an ad hoc basis as we appear 

4

to have done in the past would have the disadvantage of 

5

continued unpredictability without the corresponding 

6

advantage of greater fidelity to the intent of Congress. 

7

We think that this" rule affords us  "this case 

8

affords us an opportunity to adopt a more general rule, 

9

to govern the applicability of equitable tolling in 

10
11

suits against the government." 
 Yet everything I've heard, not everything, 

12

but many of the things I've heard say that this statute 

13

is special because if we go into the history of it, if 

14

we decide what the various other rules are that might 

15

infer intents where they say nothing, if we look over 

16

the  if we do this, if we do that, we will discover 

17

that here, unlike many other statutes that use the words 

18

"forever barred," here Congress really intended it. 

19
20
21

 Now, how do we reconcile that view with the 
two sentences I just read? 
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Well, Justice Breyer, I think 

22

that it would be very easy if the Irwin presumption were 

23

just conclusive, but it's not.  The Court adopted that 

24

presumption as a way to implement congressional intent, 

25

and the Court made clear that it's rebuttable, which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

means that the government is  if the government can 

2

come forward with statutespecific evidence that it is 

3

rebutted, the Court needs to honor congressional intent 

4

in an individual case.  So the Irwin presumption can't 

5

excuse the normal statutory interpretation process, 

6

looking at the text, context, and history. 

7

 A brief point on the court of claims issue. 

8

If I understand Respondent, he would distinguish our 

9

cases by saying that they were all rendered after this 

10

Court's Tucker Act line of cases in 1906 and 1935. 

11

Notably, that's before Congress enacted the FTCA.  And 

12

it shows that Congress, when it was enacting that 

13

language, had no reason to think that there was some 

14

tribunalbased difference between the court of claims 

15

and the district court such that the language would be 

16

interpreted in fundamentally different ways based only 

17

on the tribunal. 

18

 A final point I  I would like to make, 

19

drawing back, to just focus on what I understand to be 

20

the basic divide between the parties in this case. 

21

Respondents in both cases seek primarily to rely on a 

22

general presumption, the Irwin presumption, which wasn't 

23

announced with this particular statute in mind. 

24
25

 The government has come forward with an 
overwhelming amount of statutespecific evidence related
