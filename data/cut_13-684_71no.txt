 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Loans.

 Mr. Frederick. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 The narrow question in this case is whether 

12

the Truth in Lending Act rescission provision in 1635(a) 

13

requires borrowers to file a lawsuit to exercise their 

14

right to rescind.  The answer is no, and the court of 

15

appeals should be reversed for three reasons:  The plain 

16

language of Section 1635(a); the statutory context of 

17

1635; and the longstanding regulatory interpretation by 

18

the two agencies who have been charged with 

19

administering the provision. 

20

 I'd like to start with the plain text of 

21

1635(a), and we've set out the language in the first 

22

page of our addendum to the blue brief, where a couple 

23

of things are quite important to take note of. 

24

 One is that the rescission right, the 

25

mechanism that is set forth in the statute is by

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

notifying the creditor, and that's true whether the 

2

rescission occurs within 3 days or 3 years of the 

3

closing of the loan transaction. 

4
5
6

 The second thing that's important to point 
out 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, let's talk  let's 

7

talk about the first thing you say rescission is 

8

affected by.  Okay?  It seems to me that it's  it's 

9

common usage to, for instance, one could say on Election 

10

Day you vote by going to the precinct and presenting 

11

identification.  Now, that is not how you vote.  That's 

12

a preliminary step to your voting, and I think that it's 

13

possible to read the "by giving notice" as  as to say 

14

where  where that's the only thing you have to do, as 

15

it is for the 3day cancellation rescission, that's the 

16

end of it. 

17

 But where there is something else to be 

18

done, where you have to return whatever you have 

19

received under the  under the transaction, it seems to 

20

me more reasonable to read it as, you know, you vote by 

21

presenting yourself at the precinct and  and offering 

22

identification. 

23

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, Congress could have 

24

written Section 1635(a) that way, but it didn't.  And 

25

when it wrote "by notifying," even if it was within the

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

3year period, Justice Scalia, it also provided that it 

2

had to be done in accordance with regulations of the 

3

Bureau.  And when Regulation Z was promulgated in 1969, 

4

the Federal Reserve Bank took exactly the same position 

5

that we're arguing now, which is that the notification 

6

to the lender could occur in a writing, and they used 

7

their regulations to spell out the various 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, wait, wait, wait, 

wait.  By notifying in accordance with regulations, it 

10

seems to me that speaks to the manner of notifying, not 

11

to the consequence of notifying.  And Regulation Z may 

12

indeed say what the consequence is, but I don't think 

13

that the statute authorizes Regulation Z to say that. 

14

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, the statute actually 

15

does say that in the (b) provision, Justice Scalia. 

16

We'll get to that in a moment. 

17

 But the point here is that nowhere in 

18

1635(a) did Congress say you had to file a lawsuit, and 

19

nowhere in Regulation Z is there a provision that a 

20

borrower has to file a lawsuit in order to rescind.  And 

21

remember, the definition of rescission is a unilateral 

22

cancellation of the transaction. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but  but in common 

24

law you had to give back in what you had received, and 

25

you have  you  you are urging that the statute

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

creates a system in which a  a creditor who has a 

2

secured interest, simply because somebody comes up 

3

almost 3 years later and says, you didn't give me two 

4

copies of this particular document, I got only one copy, 

5

and even if that's not true, immediately the secured 

6

interest is converted into an unsecured interest.  That 

7

is a huge difference.  And I find it difficult to 

8

believe that that's what Congress intended. 

9

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, the language of the 

10

statute actually makes that very clear, and so do the 

11

regulations.  And notably, Justice Scalia, in three 

12

places in three successive sentences in 1635(a, Congress 

13

said the manner of rescission is going to be done in 

14

accordance with regulations, the disclosures that need 

15

to be done have to be done in accordance with 

16

regulations, and there have to be appropriate forums for 

17

the obligor to exercise his right to rescind.  And that 

18

is also set forth in the regulations. 

19

 So I don't think 1635(a) could be any 

20

clearer that it is notification by writing in accordance 

21

with the regulations set forth by the Federal agency. 

22

Again 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could you just explain how 

24

you  how you think this would play out?  So the 

25

obligor sends a letter and says:  I'm rescinding, and

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then the creditor fulfills its obligations, and then the 

2

obligor is required to tender the property? 

3

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Correct. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And what if the obligor says 

5

at that point, I don't have it, I've spent it. 

6

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Okay.  So 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Then what happens?  So the 

8

rescission is rescinded? 

9

 MR. FREDERICK: 

The statute answers that 

10

question, Justice Alito, in 1635(b), and that's the 

11

second page of the addendum to our blue brief. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

How does it answer it? 

13

 MR. FREDERICK: 

It answers the question by 

14

making clear that the process that you set forth is 

15

what's supposed to happen automatically, but then the 

16

very last sentence, which reads, "The procedures 

17

prescribed by this subsection shall apply except when 

18

otherwise ordered by a court."  That sentence was added 

19

in 1980, 12 years after the Truth in Lending Act was 

20

originally promulgated.  And the reason why Congress 

21

added that sentence was because there had been case law 

22

that raised the problem that you are identifying. 

23

 So what that sentence is intended to do is 

24

to give courts the flexibility to reorder the various 

25

provisions or slow things down so that the tender back

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

actually happens in a way that does  is not unfair to 

2

the lender. 

3

 And we've not found a single case in the 

4

45year history of this Act where the borrower has 

5

gotten any kind of windfall.  We've looked extremely 

6

hard at this. 

7

 But notably, the reason why this precision 

8

happens this way, there's a rationale for it, and the 

9

rationale is that after the borrower has put forth all 

10

this money to get the loan in the first place, unless 

11

the borrower can get back those proceeds and have the 

12

security interest released, it's virtually impossible, 

13

or extremely difficult, to get a refinancing on the 

14

property. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, suppose  suppose 

16

the rescission notice is really improper.  The borrower 

17

had received the two copies.  And 21/2 years into the 

18

loan, it sends to the bank notice:  We're rescinding. 

19

The bank sends back a letter saying:  You can't rescind 

20

because we gave you all the documents. 

21

 Then nothing happens for a year. 

And then 

22

the  or say for 5 years.  Then the borrower sues.  I 

23

take it at that point, the bank could say your State 

24

statute of limitations has run? 

25

 MR. FREDERICK: 

That  that's right.  But

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the way that your hypothetical most commonly arises, 

2

Justice Kennedy, is in judicial foreclosure States, and 

3

that would be where the bank would wait for a period of 

4

time before bringing a foreclosure action in court, and 

5

then the borrower would assert the rescission as a 

6

defense, as an affirmative defense, like the Beach v. 

7

Ocwen situation, except that in your hypothetical, the 

8

borrower had timely sent the written notification of 

9

rescission in time, within the 3year period, and so, 

10

therefore, would have preserved the right to rescind as 

11

an affirmative defense. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So  so the borrower has 

13

to send its notice that it's not  does not agree with 

14

the right to rescind within the 3year period? 

15

 MR. FREDERICK: 

The  the  yes, that's 

16

right.  Our  under our position, the written 

17

notification 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose  suppose the 

19

suppose the notice comes 3 days before the 3year period 

20

ends, and the bank just doesn't have time? 

21

 MR. FREDERICK: 

No, the bank under the 

22

procedures in Section (b) has 20 days in which to 

23

tend  to pay back the loan proceeds that had been 

24

conferred to the borrower.  So the way this works in 

25

practice is that the bank takes its 20 days, and if it

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

investigates the loan file and it comes to the 

2

conclusion that it has an argument that the borrower has 

3

improperly sent a notice of rescission, it does what the 

4

bank did here, which is to write a letter back and say: 

5

We contest or we dispute your rescission. 

6

 The question is, in this case, did the 

7

Jesinoskis timely send their written notification of 

8

rescission in the face of that, and our position is that 

9

the court of appeals was wrong. 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Frederick, the bank, 

11

as soon as it receives the notice of rescission  one 

12

of the benefits for people who don't want to pay a 

13

mortgage is that it suspends the mortgage payments; 

14

correct? 

15

 MR. FREDERICK: 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17
18
19
20
21
22

That's correct. 
All right.  So isn't it 

in the bank's 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Although if I could 

interrupt 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 isn't it  I'm 

sorry. 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Sorry.  If I could interrupt 

23

you, many times borrowers will send their rescission 

24

notice and actually continue to pay. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But for those who don't,

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the bank can file a declaratory judgment suit? 

2

 MR. FREDERICK: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

That's correct. 
All right.  And even for 

the ones who do, they could do the same thing? 

5

 MR. FREDERICK: 

That's correct.  And in 

6

nonjudicial foreclosure States, where  to go back to 

7

your hypothetical, Justice Kennedy, there's  there's a 

8

harder wrinkle on this.  A bank would not need to go to 

9

court to foreclose on the borrower.  It would simply do the 

10

notices provided under State law and have the sheriff, 

11

you know, send a  provide a notice saying we're going 

12

to sell your house.  And then in that case, the burden 

13

really shifts to the borrower to go to court to get a 

14

temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to 

15

say, hey, I sent my rescission notice, the bank is 

16

ignoring it.  Please don't sell my house out from under 

17

me. 

18

 And  and that kind of procedure makes a 

19

lot of sense in the real world, where these kinds of 

20

written notifications provided by the expert agency 

21

charged with administering it create a simple process by 

22

which the rights of both sides can fairly be determined. 

23

That's been the way this statute has been understood up 

24

until very recently when the circuit conflict developed, 

25

really, in response to this Court's decision in Beach.

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

In Beach, simply reading the plain language of 1635(f), 

2

and if I could turn to that, it's on page 4. 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Before  before you do, 

4

Mr. Frederick, you are recognizing that the only 

5

recourse the lender has if the borrower is  is 

6

claiming something that is baseless, the only recourse 

7

is to bring a declaratory judgment action? 

8

 MR. FREDERICK: 

No.  Actually, I don't agree 

9

with that, Justice Ginsburg.  The borrow  lender has 

10

several recourses.  First, it notifies the lend  the 

11

borrower that it doesn't agree with its position about 

12

the rescission.  And then it depends really on whether 

13

we're in a judicial foreclosure State or a nonjudicial 

14

foreclosure State. 

15

 In the judicial foreclosure States, the next 

16

thing that's likely to happen is that the bank would go 

17

to State court and file a foreclosure action, at which 

18

point the validity of the rescission notice would be the 

19

first issue that would be decided by the court in 

20

determining whether or not the foreclosure was proper to 

21

begin with. 

22

 But if we're in a nonjudicial disclosure 

23

State, and we're roughly 50/50 among the States in terms 

24

of which are which, then we have the problem that I was 

25

identifying with Justice Sotomayor, where the buyer is

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to have to take the initiative to go to court to 

2

get a declaratory judgment that it had  he or she had 

3

properly rescinded the loan. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So why do you think it is 

5

that Congress didn't say how we resolve disputes in this 

6

context? 

7

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, I think that the 

8

the answer to that is that Congress expected that this 

9

unilateral right of rescission was going to be exercised 

10

in a simple way through the written notification and 

11

that what has happened is 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But Congress couldn't have 

13

thought that every time there was a notification, the 

14

the lender was going to agree with the borrower that it 

15

was appropriate.  Congress must have thought that 

16

that there were going to be some cases where the lender 

17

and the borrower disagreed, and yet Congress didn't say 

18

anything about how those cases would be resolved and 

19

that's a puzzling feature of this statute. 

20

 MR. FREDERICK: 

It is a puzzling feature, 

21

Justice Kagan, and I can't deny that.  But I can say 

22

that Congress revisited the language of the statute four 

23

times after its initial enactment in 1974 and 1980 and 

24

1995 and in 2010, and it never changed the mechanism of 

25

rescission that it set forth in the original provision

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of 1635(a).  And so when it put in these provisions like 

2

expiring the right, which it did in (f) and it did that 

3

in 1974, it provided a termination of the right which we 

4

think dovetails with (a). 

5

 And if you look at the two key linguistic 

6

points here, the obligor's right of rescission  this 

7

is in (f) now, and I'm on page 4 of the addendum to our 

8

blue brief  really tracks the language of right to 

9

rescind in (a).  And when it says in (a) "this section," 

10

the right to rescind in "this section," when Congress 

11

subsequently enacted (f) to put the expiration of three 

12

years, it's mirroring that language when it says, "the 

13

obligor's right of rescission." 

14

 And then secondly in (f), when it says, the 

15

information and forms required under this section is 

16

also a mirror to what had been put forth in (a) where it 

17

provides that there are disclosures and forms that are 

18

going to be promulgated under the regulations. 

19

 So in that regard, I think what Congress was 

20

trying to get at was to keep the process simple.  If 

21

there was going to be litigation, as there invariably 

22

has, courts would be able to sort that out using what 

23

they added in 1980, which is the last sentence of 

24

subsection B, which is to give the Court some 

25

flexibility in determining how to do the payback and the

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

tender back scheme. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You're reading an awful lot 

3

into that section.  "The procedures prescribed by the 

4

sub"  that sentence, "The procedures prescribed by the 

5

subsection shall apply except when otherwise ordered by 

6

a court," doesn't tell the Court what to do.  It doesn't 

7

tell the Court what it can't do. 

8
9

 MR. FREDERICK: 

That's right.  And, 

Justice Alito, if you read the cases  and I would  I 

10

would point you to Footnotes 9 and 10 of the State's 

11

amicus brief, they set forth in one a long list of State 

12

cases and in the other a long list of Federal cases. 

13

 The way I read them is that these are like 

14

mini bankruptcy proceedings the  where the  where 

15

the lender and the borrower are going into court and 

16

and they are  they're making arguments about the 

17

propriety of the rescission.  They're making arguments 

18

about how much is owed.  They're making arguments about 

19

what claims need to go back and forth, and that the 

20

Court ultimately is making a decision that tallies up 

21

based on the loan proceeds and all the back and forth, 

22

who's going to owe what to whom. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Frederick, does your 

24

argument depend on us agreeing with the proposition that 

25

the rescission is completed at the time the notice is

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

set? 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

I think that it  no, but 

3

it does depend on accepting the idea that rescission is 

4

just cancellation.  And then if restitution occurs, 

5

which are all the (b) procedures, those are going to 

6

happen after the cancellation.

rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG 

12

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

13
14
15
16

 SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 
 We agree with Petitioners that 

17

Section 1635(f) is very tightly linked to Section 

18

1635(a).  Section 1635(a) opens a threeday window for 

19

exercising the right to rescind.  And if the disclosures 

20

and forms that the lender is required to give the 

21

borrower aren't given, then that threeday window 

22

essentially marches forward in time all the way up to 

23

the threeyear mark. 

24
25

 What Section 1635(f) does is put a backstop 
on how far that threeday window can proceed and an

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

endpoint on the exercise of the right of rescission 

2

through a written notice. 

3

 But nothing in Section 1635(f) refers to 

4

bringing an action in court, to a cause of action, to 

5

any of the language that one would expect to find in a 

6

statute of repose.  And that provision, I think, can't 

7

fairly be described as a statute of repose under this 

8

Court's 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Or the statute of 

limitations. 
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Or a statute of limitations 

12

as this Court has already decided in Beach, that was one 

13

of the holdings of Beach.  This Court's recent decision 

14

in CTS vs. Waldburger defined a statute of repose as 

15

something that puts an outer limit on the time for 

16

brining an action, running from the date of the 

17

defendant's last culpable act or omission. 

18

 And that's not what Section 1635 does. 

It 

19

doesn't have any language to that effect.  Respondent's 

20

position would actually create an anomaly that's not 

21

seen under statutes of limitations or statutes of 

22

repose, and that would be that in some circumstances, 

23

they would require the borrower to file a suit before 

24

the violation that the borrower was complaining about 

25

had even taken place.  And that would be in a situation

in which the borrower is sending the notice of 

2

rescission, say, a few days before the threeyear period 

3

runs.  At that point, the lender has 20 days to respond 

4

and to say whether it's going to accept the notice of 

5

rescission as valid and whether it's going to 

6

voluntarily comply with the unwinding procedures in section 

7

1635(b).

 The kind of suit that a borrower would bring 
in that circumstance would be complaining about a 

10

violation of Section 1635(b) that the lender refused to 

11

do the unwinding that it was required to do under the 

12

statute.  But it might now 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose the bank 

14

suppose the bank thinks that the notice of rescission is 

15

just completely baseless.  Does it still have to respond 

16

within 20 days? 

17

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

19

there and wait and be sued. 

20

No. 
It can  it can just sit 

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

That's right, Your Honor. 

21

In our view, an invalid notice of rescission that's not 

22

timely has no effect in the world.  It has no  it puts 

23

no requirement on the lender to do anything and you can 

24

see that from the language of Section 1635(b).  I'm 

25

looking now at 2(a) of the appendix of the government's

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

brief which says that 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

3

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

4

 When an obligor exercises his right to 

Excuse me, (b), boy? 
(B), boy, yes. 

5

rescind under subsection (a) of this section, then the 

6

unwinding procedures unfold at that point.  If the 

7

obligor hasn't exercised the right in compliance with 

8

subsection (a) because it has fallen outside that 

9

threeday window for whatever reason, then I think (b) 

10

isn't triggered and the lender doesn't have an 

11

obligation to do anything. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How would that apply in 

13

this case where I take it the  the lender's position 

14

is we're being charged with not providing a second copy, 

15

and we did provide a second copy; therefore, this is a 

16

baseless claim. 

17

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

At that point, I think the 

18

lender is making  going to have to make a judgment in 

19

this case and in other cases about whether it thinks the 

20

notice is valid.  If the lender guesses wrong, then it 

21

may be that it will subsequently be held liable for 

22

damages for guessing incorrectly and for failing to 

23

follow the unwinding procedures under Section 1635(b) 

24

when it should have done so. 

25

 But that kind of retrospective determination

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is extremely common in commercial arenas and commercial 

2

actors have to make decisions like that all the time. 

3

An insurance company that gets a claim from its insured 

4

saying, I've been injured and I'm telling you within a 

5

certain amount of period after the accident  a certain 

6

time period after the accident that I've been injured, 

7

please pay me, that insurance company might pay or it 

8

might not pay.  And if it's wrong about the insured not 

9

being entitled to the benefits, then subsequently, it 

10
11

may be liable for damages there. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What would you do if you 

12

were the lender or the lender's attorney and you had a 

13

situation where just before the 3 years expire, the 

14

borrower sends a letter and they say:  We didn't get two 

15

copies?  You look at your file, if you still have the 

16

file, and you have a document where they acknowledge 

17

that they got two copies.  So what do you do?  Do you 

18

take your chances on whether this would be a jury 

19

question down the road whether you believe them that 

20

they actually didn't get the second copy or whether they 

21

believe your documentation. 

22
23
24
25

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

I think what you would do 

would depend on the circumstances. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Those are the circumstances. 

I don't think you're going to know a lot more than that.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

What would you do? 
 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Right.  In that 

3

circumstance, I would certainly start by going to the 

4

borrower and trying to work it out privately, which is, 

5

I think, what Congress primarily intended when it set up 

6

the scheme.  If I were unable to do that, it would 

7

depend, I think, on whether I thought that the prospect 

8

that that notice of rescission could someday be enforced 

9

down the line, that the borrower could go to a court and 

10

say:  Please recognize that I validly exercise my right 

11

of rescind  the right to rescind, and give me the 

12

entitlements that flow from that. 

13

 It would depend on what I wanted to do. 

If 

14

I wanted to foreclose, for instance, on the property and 

15

I needed my security interest to be absolutely rock 

16

solid in order to do that, then I might be bring a 

17

declaratory judgment action or I might, in the context 

18

of the foreclosure, ask the court to declare that the 

19

rescission was invalid. 

20

 What Section 1635(f) does is it gives the 

21

lender the power to eliminate any uncertainty if it 

22

feels the need to do so in a particular case.  Before 

23

Section 1635(f) existed, the borrower could rescind 

24

basically, indefinitely.  It could pop up years later 

25

and rescind, and the lender couldn't file a lawsuit

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

before then because there would be no adversity between 

2

the parties.  They couldn't just file a lawsuit saying, 

3

please declare that there can't be a rescission. 

4

 What Section 1635(f) does is it creates 

5

adversity, essentially.  The lender now knows that the 

6

borrower has exercised the right to rescind or believes 

7

that it's does so validly and now there's adversity 

8

between the parties, and if the lender needs to, it's 

9

now in a position to bring a declaratory judgment action 

10

or some other kind of claim to make the uncertainty go 

11

away.  So the uncertainty is cabined by Section 1635(f). 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Mr. Frederick just said that 

13

what has happened in a lot of these cases is like 

14

minibankruptcy proceedings in State court.  Is that 

15

rescission? 

16

 MS. GOLDENBERG: 

Well, I think what's 

17

happened under Section 1635(b) is that courts have taken 

18

that last sentence of Section 1635(b) as essentially the 

19

power to do equity in a particular case.  I don't think 

20

the unwinding procedures are rescission.  I agree with 

21

what Mr. Frederick said, that the definition of 

22

rescission is the annulment, abrogation, cancellation of 

23

the contract. 

24
25

 What follows from rescission is a common law 
restitution under this statute, the restitutionary

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

procedures of Section 1635(b), but I think the exercise 

2

of the right to rescind amounts to rescission.  And 

3

again, I think you can get that directly out of the 

4

statute, and I'm now looking at the same provision I was 

5

referring to before.  Section 1635(b) says in its first 

6

sentence:  "When an obligor exercises his right to 

7

rescind under Subsection (a), then the security interest 

8

becomes void upon such a rescission."  So it's treating 

9

the exercise of the right to rescind as the rescission, 

10

as the thing that is canceling or unmaking the contract, 

11

and then what flows from that are various entitlements 

12

under Section 1635(b) that are analogous to the kind of 

13

restitution that you would get at common law. 

14

 As I say, I think Respondents' position has 

15

a number of anomalies associated with it and it is not 

16

consistent with the purposes of TILA.  TILA was enacted 

17

to make things simpler and clearer for borrowers who are 

18

being confused and duped and didn't fully understand 

19

their rights.  And what Respondents' position amounts to 

20

is that there's essentially a hidden requirement that is 

21

not in the statutory language, not in the regulatory 

22

language, not in the forms that borrowers get, which 

23

come from the agency, in which lenders get a safe harbor 

24

if they use. 

25

 So there is nowhere any explanation to the

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

borrowers that they have to file suit within this period 

2

of time to exercise their rights, and that's very hard 

3

to reconcile with what Congress was getting at under 

4

TILA. 

5

 Also, to the extent that there's any doubt 

6

about the interpretation of these provisions, we do 

7

think that deference to the agency is warranted, both 

8

with respect to the regulation, which was adopted as a 

9

result of noticeandcomment rulemaking.  That's an 

10

interpretation of the statute that makes a judgment that 

11

the right to rescind is exercised the same way in every 

12

context, whether it's in the first three days or at the 

13

end of the 3year period, and we think that's entitled 

14

to Chevron deference, and if there were any doubt about 

15

that we think the agency's interpretation of the 

16

regulation is itself entitled to deference. 

17

 If the Court has no further questions

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN 

21
22
23

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

24

 When a borrower sends a notice of intent to 

25

rescind and the lender disputes that the notice is

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

timely or otherwise valid, then rescission, which is the 

2

unwinding of the transaction, will not occur unless and 

3

until a court awards it. 

4

 And, Justice Kagan, in response to your 

5

question, TILA does provide how and by when that should 

6

be done.  Section 1635(g) provides for an award of 

7

rescission and Section 1635  I'm sorry.  These are all 

8

on  (f) is  (g) is on page 4 of the appendix to the 

9

blue brief. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Waxman, please review 

11

what you just said because, as I understand it, the 

12

lender has to give the borrower a notice of opportunity 

13

to rescind which says, the borrower may cancel.  How? 

14

By notifying the lender at the lender's place of 

15

business by mail or telegram, period.  And then two 

16

copies of that are to be given, with the instruction, 

17

use one to cancel the transaction.  So it's a form that 

18

says, "This notice cancels the transaction." 

19

 MR. WAXMAN: 

20

 And what it also says is that your right to 

That's correct. 

21

rescind  and here I think we are in agreement with 

22

what I think I understand my friend from the government 

23

to just say:  If a notice of intent to rescind under A 

24

is sent in a timely fashion, that is within the 3day 

25

window or the 3day  the followup 3day window if the

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

disclosures aren't provided, then rescission is 

2

triggered.  The rescissionary process is triggered.  But 

3

if  and again, I think this is what the government 

4

conceded, that if the borrower's notice is untimely, and 

5

the notice that's provided at closing tells you the 

6

periods of time in which it is timely, it doesn't do 

7

anything. 

8

 And after 3 days, that is within 3 days of 

9

the consummation, the question of whether it's timely or 

10

not depends upon whether the lender violated TILA at the 

11

closing, and where the lender says, as happened here, I 

12

am holding your signed acknowledgment that you received 

13

these forms, their position, the plaintiffs' position, 

14

depends on a construction of the statute that says even 

15

if  once that notice is sent, even if it is completely 

16

invalid, the security interest is vitiated, the lender 

17

is required to return all monies paid, you know, except 

18

in an instance  I suppose, this is not textual  in 

19

which the bank runs in and tries to get a TRO. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that's not the 

21

position that the government has.  Let's assume that the 

22

notice of rescission is baseless, the documents were 

23

received.  The Petitioners, as I understand it, can say 

24

the bank  can say:  So what; you owe us money; we're 

25

doing nothing; we're not giving you your money back.

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

And the bank's rights are protected. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, that is our position, and 

3

when my friend, Mr. Frederick says, you know, we've 

4

never found any case of a windfall under (b), the answer 

5

isn't because in an amendment in 1995 Congress said that 

6

 in the last sentence of (b)  that a court can 

7

modify this.  It's that everybody understands that 

8

unless and until the lender agrees that the notice is 

9

timely and valid, no rescission occurs. 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But it happens in the law 

11

all the time.  Sometimes you're right, sometimes I'm 

12

right.  And we wait and see who sues first and you take 

13

your chances.  And if the bank  if you are the bank 

14

and you're wrong, ultimately the borrower is going to 

15

get damages, et cetera. 

16
17
18

 MR. WAXMAN: 

That's correct.  And what this 

is 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you don't get the 

19

right to rescission.  You don't get a rescission just by 

20

filing a lawsuit either.  So under your theory, the 

21

right of rescission has to be the award.  You can't 

22

guarantee that a court is going to act in 3 years. 

23

There are many State courts where that's just not true 

24

any more. 

25

 MR. WAXMAN: 

That is not our position, and I

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't think the other side has ever cited a case in 

2

which  we can debate whether this is called a statute 

3

of repose, but let's just accept what this Court said in 

4

Beach, which is after 3 years the substantive right for 

5

which the remedy of rescission is available expires. 

6
7
8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But in Beach there was no 

notice within the 3 years. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Justice Ginsburg, I don't think 

anybody is disagreeing that everything that the Court 

10

said in Beach was not  that we're each relying on, is 

11

dicta because there was no notice.  But my point here is 

12

if the underlying right disappears after 3 years and the 

13

question is:  What is that a right to?  And it is a 

14

right to rescission.  And what happens in an instance 

15

where the lender says your notice is either untimely or 

16

invalid for another reason is the borrower has to  has 

17

3 years in order to take some action to obtain an award 

18

of rescission, which is exactly the remedy that Congress 

19

specifies in 1635(g) and which is referred back to in 

20

1640(a)(3) and 1640(c), which is, you can accomplish 

21

rescission.  That is  and rescission is at common law 

22

and common understanding the return of the parties to 

23

the status quo. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

This isn't at common law. 

This is a statute and (b) describes how rescission works

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

under this statute, 1635(b). 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

And there is  nobody is 

3

arguing that Congress didn't tinker with the common law 

4

procedure either in law or equity.  The point that I'm 

5

trying to make here is, Congress said in (g) what 

6

happens in order to accomplish rescission where the 

7

lender doesn't agree. 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's a very 

9

that's a very  you're putting an awful lot of weight 

10

on a tiny, onesentence provision in (g) that's called 

11

"additional relief" that  I think it would be very odd 

12

if that's where Congress decided to place the provision 

13

that tells you what happened  what happens when 

14

there's exercise of the right to rescind. 

15

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I 

16

think one needs to understand the context in which that 

17

provision was enacted.  There was always an 

18

understanding from the start  and, in fact, the 

19

understanding is reflected in subsection (c) which is 

20

establishes a presumption that the required forms were 

21

delivered, a presumption that can only apply in a 

22

judicial proceeding.  Everybody understood that in many, 

23

many cases in which a notice was sent after  beyond 3 

24

days after consummation, that there would be litigation 

25

about this.

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, that seems right, Mr. 

2

Waxman, that people understood that there would be 

3

litigation and (g) is an acknowledgment of that.  It's 

4

an acknowledgment that there are going to be some suits 

5

out there and it might be a Declaratory Judgment Act or 

6

it might be a foreclosure proceeding or it might be a 

7

bankruptcy proceeding, in which the question of 

8

rescission was going to come up and on which it was 

9

going to be adjudicated.  And all that (g) says is that 

10

in those cases the court can award not only rescission 

11

but damages. 

12

 But that's hardly a requirement that the 

13

borrower bring suit subject  you know, bring suit 

14

subject to the (f) clause of 3 years.  It's just not the 

15

way you would write a dispute resolution provision. 

16

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Justice Kagan, the  (g) was 

17

intended  and we know this very clearly and I think 

18

it's pretty obvious from the language  what had 

19

happened in litigation before 1995 was that borrowers 

20

where a lender said, nope that's not valid, I'm not 

21

rescinding, I'm not going to go through the unwinding 

22

process of (b), the borrowers had a choice of filing a 

23

suit for damages under 1640, which has a 1year statute 

24

of limitations, or pursuing in an action for rescission, 

25

for a court award of rescission.

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And what was happening that precipitated (g) 

2

was that courts were requiring the borrowers to elect 

3

remedies.  And what (g) says is:  No, no, no, no; if you 

4

are suing for an award of rescission, you can also get 

5

relief under 1640.  And similarly, they amended 

6

1640(a)(3), which involves a suit for damages, to say 

7

that if it is also a request for an award of rescission 

8

and you prevail, you get attorneys fees. 

9

 But every provision in here that talks about 

10

a suit for rescission says just that.  It's not a suit 

11

by the borrower for restitution of a rescission that has 

12

already occurred.  It's not a suit for a return of 

13

monies provided under the loan.  It is a suit for 

14

restitution, and that  that formulation had a very, 

15

very specific 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

 MR. WAXMAN: 

18

 That had a completely unexceptional,

widespread understanding at the common law. 
 Now, Justice Ginsburg, I'm not suggesting 

21

that Congress didn't tinker with procedures under the 

22

common law.  But this Court has warned again and again 

23

that Congress is not presumed to abrogate common law 

24

principles and Congress, when it does so, has to speak 

25

directly.

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So in this instance, for example 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It hasn't spoken 

3

directly when it sets out a specific procedure for the 

4

parties to follow? 

5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It sets out a 
It tells out  tells 

7

the borrower:  with the notice.  It tells the lender to 

8

take 20 days to say yea or nay.  And if it says yea, it 

9

has to return the money and the other side has to give 

10
11

the property. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

Spoken utterly clearly about 

12

all of those things and it also said what happens in the 

13

mine run of these late notification cases that  I mean 

14

between 3 days and 3 years of the consummation of the 

15

transaction, that if the borrower  if the lender says 

16

your notice is invalid, no rescission  by any 

17

definition rescission has not taken place and the 

18

borrower's recourse is a suit for an award of rescission 

19

as it would have been under common law.  And I think 

20

it's important to 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Am I correct the government 

22

says rescission has taken place if the borrower is right 

23

and it has not taken place if the borrower is wrong? 

24
25

 MR. WAXMAN: 

I'm not exactly sure what the 

government's position is.  I did hear the government say

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that rescission by definition hasn't occurred if the 

2

borrower  if the lender disputes the notice. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, no, no, no.  Not if the 

4

lender disputes.  If in fact the notice has been given, 

5

the rescission is ineffective.  I think that's the 

6

government's position. 

7

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Well, our  I don't know what 

8

the government's position is on that, but I know what 

9

our position is, which is if the lender receives the 

10

notice and says, yep, this is timely, subsection (b) 

11

very specifically  you know, with respect to the 

12

common law  explains the steps that have to occur to 

13

achieve rescission.  There's no question about that 

14

whatsoever. 

15

 But those steps ­ that no court has held  at 

16

least since 1974, in a case that neither of my friends 

17

have cited, no court has held that just by sending in a 

18

piece of paper, valid or invalid, the steps of (b) have 

19

to occur, even where the , even where  I mean, another 

20

typical instance in these cases, and by the way 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I take it they do 

22

have to occur or there are going to be damages at least. 

23

Let's assume a valid notice of rescission 21/2 years 

24

down the line.  The bank has a choice.  There is a 

25

rescission.  If the bank says we are  we are wrong, we

33

Alderson Reporting Company

1

have to return the property, it returns the property, it 

2

complies with (b), it does it within 20 days, there's a 

3

rescission.  There's no court order, there's nothing. 

4
5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

So here's what happens, if the 

bank 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There is a rescission  I 

8

think there are two very different things here that 

9

address  in 1635(g) and 1640 and this Court's decision 

10

in Beach underscores just exactly how much those two 

11

things are different.  A borrower  I can generalize it 

12

by saying any party to a contract.  In this case, it's 

13

the borrower to a refinancing.  Anybody can say, hey, 

14

you're not performing under the contract and I want to 

15

 I want to file a suit to require you to perform, 

16

which is the ordinary contract remedy, or give me 

17

damages for not having performed, which is what is in 

18

1640(a), a suit for damages for not having  for having 

19

violated TILA or at common law and under the statute 

20

there can be a suit for a very different, much more 

21

Draconian remedy, which is a suit for rescission, and a 

22

suit for rescission is what this lawsuit is about. 

23

 The  the question in this case is what 

24

must a borrower do to obtain resolution of a contested 

25

assertion of rescission and by when must it do it.  And

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the amazing thing is that my friends on the other side 

2

say the statute is silent about that point.  We say, no, 

3

it's not.  The statute provides for, maybe not as 

4

directly and in suffice  in a clear exposition in (g) 

5

as one would have hoped to avoid all this litigation, 

6

but nonetheless, (g) has been construed and construed by 

7

Congress in 1640(a)(3) as providing the borrower a cause 

8

of action for an award of rescission. 

9

 And in a situation where, you know, the 

10

loss  where the borrow  where the lender says no, 

11

we're not rescinding, rescission, by any definition, has 

12

not occurred, and the lawsuit is about whether a court 

13

should award rescission 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Let's talk about (g), 

15

about the rescission occurring or not.  It talks about 

16

the exercise of a right. 

17

 MR. WAXMAN: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

Yes.  And 
But the exercise of the 

right doesn't mean that the act will have come about. 

20

 MR. WAXMAN: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Of course. 
You  you answered me 

22

earlier that a court doesn't have to finish within the 

23

three years.  You just want to say that it requires the 

24

exercise to be a court action, but the statute says 

25

something else.  It's just notification.

35

 MR. WAXMAN: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, no 
Why is that so 

3

illogical?  I  I don't understand why it has to be a 

4

court action. 

5

 MR. WAXMAN: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7
8
9

The right 
An exercise of a right 

is in accordance with the terms of the contract. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

The question  I mean, the 

right of rescission means in (a), as it says, the 

10

timely  I mean, it doesn't define what the right of 

11

rescission is.  What it says is this  these are the 

12

circumstances in which the borrower has the right to 

13

rescind.  And those circumstances are if within three 

14

days you send a notice of intention to rescind, you have 

15

exercised your right to rescind.  And what that means 

16

is, as it was at common law, you have put to your 

17

counterparty an intention to unwind the transaction. 

18

And the quest  and the right, not the  not the 

19

this isn't a case  the issue in this case is not how 

20

you exercise the right of rescission under (a). 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You just gave  you 

22

just gave your case away when you said the exercise of 

23

the right is when you sent the notice. 

24
25

 MR. WAXMAN: 

No, but the  but the 

problem  no, no.  By all  don't let me be mistaken

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here.  This is not a question about how you exercise 

2

your right to rescind.  Everyone agrees that you 

3

exercise your right to rescind, that is, to initiate the 

4

unwinding process that constitutes rescission by sending 

5

a timely and valid notice.  Sending that notice does not 

6

accomplish rescission.  And the quest  and the 

7

question in  the quest 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The question is whether 

that's the exercise of the right within three years. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

And the answer is no, because 

11

where the  where the lender says I'm not  I don't 

12

agree and we are not going to accomplish rescission in 

13

(b), the statute says, very commonsensically, the party 

14

that wants this extraordinary remedy can sue for an 

15

award of rescission.  And the loss  because the 

16

lawsuit is about whether a court should, quote, "award 

17

rescission," the borrower needs to have a live right of 

18

rescission at the time that suit is initiated. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Where does it say all that? 

20

I mean, what it seems to say is that a person who 

21

borrows some money borrows money.  Now, he can tell the 

22

lender, I changed my mind.  When?  Well, within three 

23

days or later of the time he sends them certain 

24

information.  Okay?  Three days later he has to get the 

25

information.  So he has three days after that.

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. WAXMAN: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No argument. 
That's the end of it.  And 

3

how do you do it?  It says you do it by sending him a 

4

notice.  That's what it says.  So  so send him a 

5

notice, and you do it.  When do you have to do it?  You 

6

have to do it three days after he sends you certain 

7

information, but in no case beyond three years.  Now, 

8

that's what it seems to say. 

9
10

 MR. WAXMAN: 

You are  yes, Justice Breyer. 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now  now, how  how do 

11

you get out of that?  That's what I don't quite 

12

understand.  It's like you're Houdini, I mean 

13

 MR. WAXMAN: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

15

 MR. WAXMAN: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Justice Breyer, the "it" 
What? 
 when you say "doing it" 
Yes. 
 the "it" that you're 

18

required doing is sending the notice.  There's no 

19

dispute among anybody as to two things. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, that's not what it says 

21

at the beginning.  It says, "You shall have the right to 

22

rescind by notifying the creditor." 

23

 MR. WAXMAN: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

Yes, exactly.  That is what 
So it doesn't say that's 

notice by notifying the creditor.  It says, "the right

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to rescind by notifying the creditor."  I mean, okay. 

2

Go ahead.  Now, that  I'm just expressing my  you 

3

see the problem I have.  I read the words, and it seems 

4

to me it's pretty tough. 

5
6
7
8
9

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Let me  let  I don't think 

so.  I mean, I think you have to view this 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I know you don't.  That's 

why we're here. 
 MR. WAXMAN: 

You have to view the statute as 

10

a whole, and you have to view it in the context of how 

11

rescission  what rescission meant at common law, what 

12

rescission means today, and how the rescissionary 

13

process  what constitutes rescission. 

14

 There is no dispute among any parties that 

15

when a valid, timely notice is filed, that triggers the 

16

rescission.  It triggers the rescissionary process.  But 

17

there is also no dispute, as Ms. Goldenberg said, that a 

18

borrower's notice doesn't do anything unless the notice 

19

was timely and otherwise valid. 

20

 And after three days  and I  I do think 

21

it's worth pointing out what the threeday period is and 

22

what it was meant to be.  After three days, that depends 

23

on whether the  the lender violated TILA and where the 

24

lender and the borrower disagree again.  There is a 

25

right of action in (g) and referenced in (a)(3) for a 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an award of rescission.  No lender is suing for an award 

2

of rescission. 

3

 And as to the threeday period, let  let 

4

me just say a couple things about context here and what 

5

Congress thought. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Could I  could I 

7

interrupt before you get to that?  You don't take 

8

breaths between sentences.  It makes it hard. 

9
10

 (Laughter.) 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

As I understand your case, 

11

you're  you're drawing a distinction between 

12

exercising the right to rescind and obtaining 

13

rescission.  Is  doesn't your case hinge on that? 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
That  that the notice is 

16

simply an exercise of your right to rescind, but 

17

rescission does not occur until there's the exchange 

18

that the common law? 

19

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Yes.  And correlatively, the 

20

fact that an untimely or otherwise invalid notice 

21

doesn't do anything.  Now, if 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Waxman, if that's 

23

right, so exercising the right to rescind is by notice. 

24

But then you look at (f) and it says, "an obligor's 

25

right of rescission shall expire."

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So I read that and I say, okay, that means 

2

when you can no longer exercise your right to rescind, 

3

which you've just said is when you can send notice.  So 

4

that's what expires after three years, your ability to 

5

send notice. 

6
7
8
9

 MR. WAXMAN: 

No, I think it's not.  What it 

talks 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But it just says right there 

it's the right to rescission shall expire, and you agree 

10

that exercising the right of rescission is done by 

11

notice. 

12

 MR. WAXMAN: 

The  as the  no.  As this 

13

Court explained in multiple places in Beach, all of 

14

which are dicta, admittedly, the operation of (f) not 

15

only  is not only to put a cutoff for the last date at 

16

which you can send a notice, but it, quote, "operates to 

17

extinguish the right," which is the foundation for the 

18

claim, and, therefore, it necessarily, quote, "limits 

19

the time for bringing suit by governing the life of the 

20

underlying right." 

21

 And so in a circumstance in which a notice 

22

is sent, which is a notice of intent to rescind under 

23

(a), if the  if the lender says, you're right, and 

24

this is the common instances within the three day of 

25

closing, which I'd like to address, the  the statute

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

says here's how you unwind it.  You go through the 

2

procedures in (b). 

3

 If the  if the lender says no, that's not 

4

a valid right, it's not timely, the borrow  the 

5

statute gives the borrower not only a cause of action 

6

for damages under 1640, but a cause of action for an 

7

award of rescission.  And because the lawsuit is about 

8

whether the Court should, quote, "award rescission," the 

9

borrower needs a live right of rescission at the time 

10

the lawsuit is filed, and that  that is our position. 

11

 Now, as to this threeday point. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

By that, if you say the 

13

rescission doesn't  the right to rescission has to 

14

be  it just expires after three years.  Well, we don't 

15

know if he has a right to rescind until the lawsuit is 

16

actually terminated. 

17

 MR. WAXMAN: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well 
So  so he  we're just 

19

as much in the dark.  He happened to have filed a piece 

20

of paper called a lawsuit, but the judge is extremely 

21

slow.  I have known some. 

22

 MR. WAXMAN: 

23

 (Laughter.) 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

Deliberative. 

And  and ten years later, 

there it is, sitting on his docket and  and nobody

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

knows.  How are we any more  how are we any more 

2

enlightened than the day before he filed the lawsuit? 

3

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Justice  Justice Breyer, no 

4

one is contending in this  in this case that a statute 

5

of repose, that is, a statute provides that an 

6

underlying right expires after some date certain.  It 

7

disables a court from rendering judgment in that case. 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course not.  Of course 

not. 

10

 MR. WAXMAN: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course not. 
Of course not.  But I'm 

12

just saying why pick the date that you file a lawsuit 

13

in  in terms of the validity of the notice 

14

 MR. WAXMAN: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Because 
Since the  the filing of 

16

the lawsuit no more determines the validity of the 

17

notice than it was determined three days before. 

18

 MR. WAXMAN: 

Because  because 1635(f) 

19

refers to the obligor's right of rescission and where 

20

the obligor has not obtained the rescission that he or 

21

she claims he has a right to, he can go to a court for 

22

an award of rescission and the statute tells him, you 

23

have to have a live underlying right of rescission 

24

before you invoke the court's jurisdiction to do it, 

25

which is exactly what happened at the common law in

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these circumstances. 

2

 Now, I just want to say that I think, you 

3

know, the other side says, well, we're making a big 

4

distinction between whether the notice is sent within 

5

three days or after because somehow nobody could believe 

6

that a lawsuit would be filed within three days. 

7

 1635(a) doesn't govern when a lawsuit is 

8

filed.  It governs when the notice of an intention to 

9

rescind has to be sent.  If there is a dispute about 

10

whether that notice is timely or whether it's otherwise 

11

valid, for example, it's often invoked in cases where 

12

there is a refinancing with the original lender, which 

13

this doesn't apply to, or a purchase money mortgage 

14

where this doesn't apply to. 

15

 If there is a dispute about it, let's say 

16

the  the  I think this has happened, so far as we've 

17

all been able to determine, one time in history where it 

18

comes  assertedly comes within three days of closing, 

19

and the lender says, no, no, no.  That's four days. 

20

You're too late.  Ordinarily, what Congress and the 

21

Board understood is that within the threeday period, 

22

that is, the period that in this borrowerfriendly 

23

statute where Congress was concerned about borrowers 

24

being hoodwinked in highpressure loans, the statute 

25

gives the borrower an absolute right for any reason or

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

no reason within three business days to say, you know, 

2

I've gone back and I've looked at the disclosures and 

3

I've changed my mind. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about the Board?  You 

5

mentioned the Board.  Are you going to say anything 

6

about Chevron? 

7

 MR. WAXMAN: 

There's nothing to say about 

8

Chevron in this case.  The Board's  the Board's 

9

regulations, which are now the Bureau's regulations, 

10

speak to how one  you know, what kind of notice is 

11

really notice.  And the exercise of the notice of intent 

12

to rescind, it says nothing about what's at issue in 

13

this case, which is what a lender disputes that the 

14

notice is valid, what and by when does the borrower have 

15

to do. 

16

 Now, the Board  the Bureau has asserted 

17

the position that it's asserted in amicus briefs in this 

18

case, but those  that position is entitled, I think as 

19

this Court has said, to, at best, Skidmore deference. 

20

And in this case, they fail Skidmore deference because 

21

their reading is completely inconsistent with the common 

22

law, inconsistent with the statute, that is, the 

23

provisions of (g) and (f).  And in any event, nobody is 

24

claiming that the Bureau has any expertise about this 

25

aspect of TILA.  This isn't the minerun of cases where,

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you know, what does  what does excessive interest or 

2

adequate notice mean. 

3

 Now, I think it's important to understand 

4

that within the  what Congress understood was it was 

5

providing borrowers a threeday period.  And in that 

6

threeday period rescission is pretty uncomplicated, 

7

because the  the Board and the Bureau in the 

8

regulation that's at issue in this case says to the 

9

lender, you may not, you may not disburse the loan 

10

proceeds to the borrower, or I think record your 

11

security interest.  You may not do it during the 

12

"rescissionary period," and for such time thereafter 

13

until you are satisfied that no rescission will occur. 

14

That is the Board's and the Bureau's directive. 

15

 Now, what happens in this case, in a case 

16

like this, is the transaction  the security interest 

17

has been recorded.  A lot of money has been dispensed. 

18

And the question is, at that point, whether the borrower 

19

will, by rescinding, be able to obtain essentially an 

20

interestfree loan for whatever that period of time is. 

21

 The Bank of America alone receives between 4 

22

and 6,000 of these after 3year notices every year and 

23

the number has increased every single year since they 

24

started recording this.  The notion that the  what 

25

Congress had in mind is that the lender who thinks that

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the notice is invalid and in most instances, the 

2

borrower is in default, has to run in  no matter how 

3

frivolous this complaint is  and file what would be, 

4

among all lenders, tens of thousands of lawsuits a year. 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, they'd have to do 

6

that anyway to foreclose.  The only time that it's a 

7

problem is when the borrower is not paying the loan, but 

8

in most of these, the borrower stops paying the loan. 

9

 MR. WAXMAN: 

In most  most foreclosure 

10

first of all, foreclosures may or may not occur, 

11

depending on whether the bank wants it and many, many, 

12

if not most, foreclosures are nonjudicial; so there's no 

13

judicial proceeding and a sale at foreclosure will, by 

14

everybody's understanding, vitiate the underlying right. 

15

 Thank you. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

17

 Four minutes, Mr. Frederick.

21
22

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 
 I think if the Court were to accept the 

23

bank's position here, the Truth in Lending Act would 

24

become even more complicated, because the rules of the 

25

road under the statute are pretty clear that if within

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

three years you've exercised the right by sending the 

2

notice, that starts a process.  And sure, the bank can 

3

contest it, but at least you know by reading the statute 

4

that you've got three years in order to exercise that 

5

right. 

6

 And the reason why that right is important 

7

is that these disclosures can be very complicated and 

8

these transactions can be very complicated.  So if you 

9

don't get the disclosures within the threeday period of 

10

the closing of the loan, you can go into the loan and 

11

you can determine this is very complicated.  I'm now 

12

seeing my rate increase.  I'm seeing my payment 

13

increase, and I don't really understand all of these 

14

various things. 

15

 Now, the point about the  the reason why 

16

the disclosures are important and the reason why the 

17

number of the disclosures is important is really clear 

18

if you actually look at the disclosure in this case. 

19

And it's at Joint Appendix page 38.  It says "right to 

20

cancel" all over it.  If you want the right to cancel, 

21

you can cancel it if you do certain things.  It never 

22

says file a lawsuit.  So the form that the bank used 

23

here didn't, you know, preserve its argument that the 

24

statute requires filing a lawsuit.  It just says you 

25

send us the notification of your intent to cancel.

48

2

 Now, importantly, and this question came 
up 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

 MR. FREDERICK: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why are two of these? 
I'm sorry? 
Why are two of these?  I 

6

mean, some of the reaction against these lawsuits is 

7

premised on the one as opposed to two copies.  It seems 

8

rather immaterial whether you get one or two.  You got 

9

it. 

10

 MR. FREDERICK: 

And let me explain that. 

11

Four were required in this case.  The reason for that is 

12

that each person who is on the loan, each borrower was 

13

entitled to get two copies.  One so that they can sign 

14

it and send it back to the bank and the other so they 

15

can keep it in their file.  And there is no dispute at 

16

that point that everybody is operating by the same rules 

17

of the road. 

18

 Why are four necessary? 

Well, we know from 

19

the financial crisis and common sense that when two 

20

people are on a loan together, they might not agree when 

21

the rubber meets the road and the rate resets or the 

22

payment increases or all these other things, and they 

23

may decide, I have an individual right to rescind that's 

24

given by statute and by the original regulations of 

25

Regulation Z.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So here, if I don't have my forms, I can't 

2

exercise my statutory right.  And that's why from the 

3

very beginning the Fed said, each borrower gets two 

4

forms.  So that everybody knew what the rules were and 

5

everybody knew how to exercise them and everybody was on 

6

the same page. 

7

 And so although it is  to be  to be 

8

fair, this is not the kind of disclosure violation that 

9

would entail an interest rate change or the change in a 

10

payment or something like that.  The same principle 

11

applies for whether or not the borrowers timely exercise 

12

their right. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It  it's always  you 

14

know, I've signed two loans in I don't know how many 

15

years, two homes, but I thought at closing, I signed

something acknowledging

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

Yes.  And let me 
 the bank kept one and 

presumably, it gave me another.  So those were the two. 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

No, it's actually you get 

two.  And if I can actually direct 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

it back to the bank saying

I don't remember sending 

 MR. FREDERICK: 

No, because you probably 

didn't cancel yours, Justice Sotomayor.

 MR. FREDERICK: 

It already is.  I've 

Well  but I  but I 

10

do want to make one  I do want to make one point. 

11

There's  there is confusion here on this particular 

12

form because the  what this says  what is says is, 

13

"The undersigned each acknowledge receipt of two 

14

copies."  It doesn't say, "The undersigned each 

15

acknowledge each receiving two copies."  And so you can 

16

understand why there is confusion about these kinds of 

17

disclosures.  And I just point out that over last years, 

18

during the financial crisis, home loan originators have 

19

gotten into a lot of trouble.  And within the last two 

20

months, this bank paid $5 billion for its shoddy loan 

21

origination practices. 

22

 It is not a surprise why we're here. 

It is 

23

not a surprise why, as Mr. Waxman says, they get a lot 

24

of these notifications.  Because they were churning out 

25

loans so fast, they wanted people to get loans under

virtually any circumstances so they could then pedal 

2

that to the Wall  to Wall Street bankers who would 

3

then sell them to unsuspecting investors. 

4

 Now, the last thing I want to say with 

5

respect to (g) is that it doesn't say exactly what he's 

6

saying.  There's no suit for rescission in (g).  What it 

7

says is that in addition to rescission, which you could 

8

read as an addition to the selfhelp remedy of the 

9

exercise of rescission, a Court may award.
