ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13
14
15

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Twenty-five years ago in Buckley this Court held

16

that limits on campaign contributions can be more easily

17

justified under the First Amendment than limits on

18

campaign expenditures, and noted that a coordinated

19

expenditure, such as one made at the candidate's request,

20

is treated as a contribution for this purpose.

21

Nothing in the First Amendment requires an

22

exemption from these rules for political parties. Congress

23

recognized that parties are different from other political

24

actors and gave them somewhat higher contribution limits

25

and much higher limits on coordinated expenditures.

1

QUESTION:

I think that you do have a problem in

2

sustaining this part of the congressional act because the

3

basis for sustaining the limits on contributions is the

4

corruption rationale that has been in our cases for, you

5

know, 50, 60 years.

6

me to see how receiving a contribution would corrupt a

7

political party.

8
9

But it's very difficult, at least for

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Political parties present the

risk -- a risk of the corruption that justifies limits on

10

contributions and coordinated expenditures in two ways.

11

First, because they can receive contributions in much

12

larger amounts than other actors and then redistribute

13

them to candidates, they provide a conduit for other

14

actors to circumvent the contribution limits of the act.

15

Other donors can make large contributions to the party

16

which, though not technically, literally earmarked, and

17

therefore not in violation of the specific earmarking

18

provision of the statute, nevertheless through informal

19

and well understood arrangements find their way through

20

the party to the candidate and create the same risk or

21

appearance of corruption as a direct contribution to the

22

candidate.

23

QUESTION:

Well, if those informal arrangements

24

are that actually this money is given to the party but we

25

know you're going to give it to candidate X, certainly the

Congress can prohibit that.

2

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Perhaps it already has.

Congress has prohibited

3

earmarking, but the Court recognized in Buckley itself

4

that a prohibition on earmarking cannot reach, cannot be

5

effective to reach the whole problem of, in effect, using

6

an intermediary to exceed the limits, and the reason is

7

for one thing an earmarking arrangement requires something

8

more rigid than what would usually happen.

9

not earmarking, for example, if -- within the meaning of

I mean, it's

10

the statute, if a contributor understands that there is a

11

good likelihood that the money will be passed by the party

12

to the candidate, although there might be reasons why it

13

would not.

14

has the prospect of being regarded by the candidate and by

15

the donor as virtually a contribution.

16

In that case it's not earmarking, but it still

QUESTION:

Let me get this straight.

I can

17

understand why there's, you know, corruption if the donor

candidate says I'll vote for your bill.

individuals to spend $100,000 in their own advertising for

21

this candidate, and it says at the bottom of the ad, you

22

know, paid for by Schwartz, and the candidate knows

23

Schwartz has bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of

24

television advertising, that is perfectly okay, right?

QUESTION:

But if Schwartz gives $100,000 to the

3

Democratic Party, we're suddenly worried that the

4

candidate is going to be corrupted because Schwartz gave

5

$100,000?

6

fanciful to think that the one situation presents, you

7

know, an opportunity for corruption and the other doesn't.

8

You're much better off if you want to corrupt Schwartz,

9

spending the money on an advertisement that says

11

I can't understand that. That seems to me so

presented, you know, presented by XYZ Corporation.
MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, the Court in Buckley had

12

to balance a number of different concerns in arriving at

13

its distinction between independent expenditures, which

14

will certainly often please the candidate, but which it

15

regarded as sufficiently important in First Amendment

16

terms so that limiting them to protect against possible

17

indirect corruption was not permissible on the one hand,

18

and contributions, direct contributions to the candidate,

Now, the additional point that I was addressing

MS. UNDERWOOD:

QUESTION:

The section --

And you talk about the significant

7

First Amendment value of an individual being able to spend

8

his money on an ad for the candidate, there is significant

9

First Amendment value in that.

It is not clear to me that

10

there is any less First Amendment value in people being

11

able to band together in political parties and in unison

12

support political candidates.

13

First Amendment value, too, and you're saying they can't

14

do that.

15

MS. UNDERWOOD:

16

QUESTION:

That's a very important

Well, no.

Well, you're saying they can do it to

17

a very limited degree, although rich individuals can take

18

out their own television ads, a party which gets

19

contributions from Joe Sixpack in five and ten dollar

20

amounts cannot do that to support a candidate.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No, the party can do it in

unlimited amounts when it is making the same kind of

QUESTION:

MS. UNDERWOOD:

we discuss this at pages 28 and 29 of our brief, several

2

Senators made -- expressly observed that a party can act

3

as a conduit for an individual who has reached his

contribution limit.

QUESTION:

So the danger is that contributors to

political parties are using those contributions to somehow

7

corrupt the candidates?

8

MS. UNDERWOOD:

9

QUESTION:

10

Correct.

And that's kind of an indirect sort

of a thing?

11

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's right.

That the

12

anti-earmarking provision itself is evidence of Congress'

13

concern about that, about the evasion of the limits on

14

donors.

15
16

QUESTION:

And you say the earmarking provision

isn't sufficient?

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's correct.

And where do we look for this

evidence of concern?

To stray remarks by some Members of

Well, there are remarks by

Members of Congress.

There is, better perhaps even than

candidate C by passing it through B.

QUESTION:

But you think that's not sufficient?

4

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's correct.

And this Court

5

said it wasn't sufficient in Buckley, and observed that

6

that's part of why -- part of what justifies the limit on

7

individual contributions in a campaign, the total limit,

8

9

QUESTION:

Is the argument, General Underwood,

10

it is not that the party is corrupted, I take it, because

11

that would seem just fatuous, but the party is kind of a

12

means to corrupting the candidate himself?

13

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

There are two arguments

14

about the risk of corruption.

15

that I'm talking bout is that the party is a means -- that

16

the contribution limits on individual donors are justified

17

as a means of preventing corruption and the risk of

18

corruption donor to candidate, and that the party, as an

19

intermediary, can facilitate, can essentially undermine

20

that mechanism that the individuals can exceed their

21

contribution limits.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

MS. UNDERWOOD:

would agree that it -- that the function of the party is

if it were prohibited from making independent

10

There is no limit on its independent

QUESTION:

Coordinated expenditures have --

It's a very strange, very strange

calculus.

5

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Coordinated expenditure has a

6

technical meaning here, and it doesn't violate the

7

prohibition on coordinated expenditure for the party to do

8

something that is consistent with the candidate's

9

campaign.

10

What the coordinated expenditure prohibition was

11

designed to prohibit was the candidate essentially paying

12

the media bills for the candidate, and the record contains

13

evidence that the over -- that the predominant forum that

14

coordinated expenditures take is exactly that.

15

QUESTION:

What if, what if the party consults

the candidate and says, you know, we're thinking of

statutory term, but the Federal Election Commission has

10

been developing regulations to try and make more precise

clear from the outset of the statute that the purpose of

No, but what I'm saying is, once you

as what you're trying to prohibit?

6

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No.

Although these things are

7

all a matter of degree, it is the case, I mean, it's -- it

8

is the case that Congress thought that contributions over

9

a certain limit created a potential for corruption, and

10

that to make that enforceable, it had to prohibit as well

11

or limit as well things that are the functional equivalent

12

of contributions, such as --

13

QUESTION:

But it's also the case that the

contrary to the whole idea of the truth that the First

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

It has been observed

2

before that Congress perhaps -- well, that Congress is

3

fully familiar with the practices of campaign expenditures

4

and campaign fund-raising and with the risks and benefits

5

that various forms of fund-raising have and that having

6

evaluated all of those risks and benefits and taken

7

guidance from these courts, the distinctions that this

8

Court has drawn, its effort to, to make those judgments is

9

entitled at least to some, some credit.

10

QUESTION:

Do we owe any deference to common

11

sense in recognizing that when Congress draws up campaign

12

funding legislation, it is more likely to draw up a system

13

that favors incumbents and is it not true that this rule

14

of course favors incumbents because the one who suffers

15

the most when he can't get significant funding from the

party is the new candidate, the unknown face who is

running against an incumbent?

on what donors can give to a candidate, they will be

2

trying to find ways to get around it, and one good way is

3

to use intermediaries that are not subject to the same

4

limits and that Congress recognized that and attempted to

5

address it without crippling other important functions by

6

putting a limit on the contributions, by not prohibiting,

7

but putting a limit on the contributions and coordinated

8

expenditures that parties can make to candidates.

9

There is a second corruption concern, and that

10

is the concern, not that the party would act as a conduit,

11

but that the party leaders in charge of dispensing funds

12

would, in effect, exact -- pay for votes, would themselves

13

tie money to legislative actions.

14

evidence in the record of that happening, but it is the

case that if a candidate's own family can be subject to a

Yes, it does.

does this case, in that coordinated expenditures are, in

that they are not, then it would be decided --

QUESTION:

But your corruption rationale is much

11

less if you're talking about a big wheel or, you know, a

13

is the fat cat is going to get something in return, but

14

the idea that a political party donating to a candidate is

Well, as I suggested, it does,

however, I think, have the same ring to say that a

19

political party can facilitate the very transaction that

20

you were just describing; that is, the fat cat now not

21

giving money directly to the candidate because he's barred

22

from doing so, but giving it to the party to transmit to

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7

MR. BARAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

8

may it please the Court, the statute before you makes it a

9

crime for a political party to send one letter to every

10

voter in the State if the candidate requested that letter

11

or collaborated in its preparation.

12

The issue before the Court is whether this

13

clear, direct, and substantial infringement on political

14

parties' First Amendment rights is justified, and based on

15

this Court's precedent, the legislative record, and the

16

factual record developed in this lengthy case, the answer

17

must be no.

18

The record demonstrates that this limit directly

19

and substantially suppresses political party speech and

20

does not prevent any discernible form of corruption.

21

Moreover, this particular Federal limit stands in contrast

22

to the majority of State laws which may restrict

it is, surely there would be a single instance of this

exercise their full First Amendment rights by spending

their money independently and ripping themselves away from

their indispensable candidates, they actually run the risk

of harming the candidates who are so important to their

own electoral success.

QUESTION:

I'm not sure how important this is,

20

but what you just said suggests this to me, that there

21

sometimes is a difference of approach to an election

22

between the candidate and the party and if you allow this

23

statute to be held unconstitutional, you would allow the

24

party to exercise its influence to cause the candidate to

25

shift its views to accept those of the party.

Isn't that

MR. BARAN:

Well, there is a fundamental, a

fundamental question of what is the right of a political

4

party in terms of placing conditions on how they are going

5

to spend their money or support candidates.

6

reason why a party could not say we will only financially

7

support candidates who agree with our party platform to

8

cut taxes.

who doesn't adhere to that platform plank, then presumably

There is no

that is their right to do so.

we get too far away from it, what was the second?

MR. BARAN:

The practical effect of striking

16

down these limits in addition to giving parties their

17

discretion as to how best to spend their limited resources

18

is that I believe the other practical effect is that it

19

will provide an incentive for political parties to raise

20

more hard money, which is presumably the beneficial money

21

that we have in our process.

22

Right now, there is actually a perverse effect

23

of these limits, rather than preventing corruption,

24

arguably, they are promoting corruption because the limits

tell a party chairman or fund-raiser it really doesn't

You are not going

to be able to spend more than this amount to promote your

candidates.

devote my limited resources and time and energy on raising

more hard money that I cannot spend, as opposed to going

out and raising more of the soft money, which cannot be

spent for perhaps the same purposes, and can't be as

politically effective, but I'm going to raise more soft

'96, '96 to 2000, and yet hard money fund-raising has

essentially plateaued.

QUESTION:

Okay but that's, I mean, that may be

14

a very good argument to Congress, maybe a dangerous

15

argument because the soft money opponents may find

16

something to run with there, but I'm not sure that it's an

argument, and I realize you were asked to get into this,

but I'm not sure that it's an argument that's going to

help us decide this case.

MR. BARAN:

QUESTION:

No.
I take it so much of the -- the other

side's position here depends on the relationship between

the coordinated expenditures and the individual

contribution limits to the candidates themselves.

do you contest the, I guess, intuitive assumption that if
