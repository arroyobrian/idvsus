Mr. Castiglione.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL CASTIGLIONE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Mr. -- excuse me.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

Despite the holding in Von Neumann that the

12

civil forfeiture hearing itself is all the process that

13

is due for the seizure of personal property, the Seventh

14

Circuit struck down Illinois's Drug Asset Forfeiture

15

Procedure Act specifically because it does not require

16

an additional adversarial hearing that takes place

17

post-seizure but before the forfeiture hearing.

18

As far back as this Court's decision in

19

Gelston v. Hoyt and Slocum v. Mayberry, this Court has

20

recognized that the civil forfeiture hearing itself is

21

the single unitary hearing, where all persons having an

22

interest in the property are present and the following

23

questions are resolved:

24
25

One --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is there any other

area -- is there any other area of law where we permit a
3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

prejudgment attachment and/or seizure of property

2

without a neutral magistrate reviewing the reason for

3

that seizure?

4

We don't permit a pretrial attachment, do

5

we, except in some narrow circumstances?

6

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Except in some narrow

7

circumstances, and I note -- and certainly in

8

garnishment cases and in replevin cases that you would

9

have to have that type of hearing.

10

are different here.

11

the seized property takes --

But the interests

18

it really exists or not.

The question is who tests

In what time frame?

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

19

Meaning you can

Your Honor, historically,

20

that has always been at the civil forfeiture hearing,

21

and that's going -- as I say, going back to Gelston,

22

because what -- what Gelston recognized is that -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

proceedings occurred in the plaintiffs' cases?

4

any lingering question concerning the status of the

5

property?

forfeiture cases have concluded, it's true.

15

State and the Respondent reached an agreement.

16

cases are over.

17

In two of the cash cases, the Respondents

So those

But we would submit, Your Honor, that this

18

case is not moot because, subsequent to the Seventh

19

Circuit decision in this case, the plaintiffs filed an

20

amended motion for class certification, and that's at

21

Docket 49 -- Docket Number 49 of the Northern District

22

docket, filed on June 19th, 2008, specifically asking

23

for damages and restitution, in addition to declaratory

24

and injunctive relief.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, has there ever been a

case in which this Court has considered the merits of a

2

dispute where the individual claims of the named

3

That's true.

16

the named plaintiffs are -- have expired?

17

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Well, the injunctive

18

claims may have expired, with the possible exception of

19

the two Respondents whose -- whose cash cases were

20

defaulted.

But, no, the damage claims, I think were -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There were no damage

22

claims when the final judgment was entered in the

23

district court?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it was a final

2

judgment, and it went up on appeal.

3

did they seek to -- I mean, while the case was in the

4

court of appeals, the final judgment dismissing the

5

case, there was nothing for the district judge to do.

6

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

And at what point

Well, but after the -- the

7

Seventh Circuit reversed the district judge's decision

8

granting the motion to dismiss, upon -- upon remand, the

9

plaintiffs -- then, at that point, asked for a

10

certification of the damage class and a restitution

11

class and expressly stated that they wished to pursue

12

a claim -- a claim for damages and restitution based on

it still hasn't been granted.

20

21

plaintiffs nor a certified class.

are taking the case from the Seventh Circuit.

the case is moot, then you are entitled to a Munsingwear

controlling authority.

I would --

the district court doesn't know whether to award damages

22

or not until it gets a final decision from -- or a

23

decision from the Seventh Circuit or this Court.
MR. CASTIGLIONE:

24
25

Honor.

That's correct, Your

I mean, the -- whether or not a damage claim

could go forward would depend on the -- on the validity

3

And our view, Justice Scalia, is that the

-- when -- the -- upon -- even though they did not

5

formally amend the complaint -- that's true; we

6

acknowledge that, but in the -- in the motion for

7

class -- in the amended motion for class cert, I think

8

the assertion of the claim for damages, at least for

mootness purposes, is enough to give this Court

jurisdiction over -- over those claims.

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

That -- with the possible

16

exception of the two Respondents whose claims defaulted,

extent they were seeking the return of their property,

2

preventing Illinois from enforcing the statute.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- I -- since they

4

defaulted in the -- in the final hearing, how can ­- can

5

they possibly have any claim left with regard to an

6

interim hearing?

7

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Well, I just think the

8

nature of their claim hasn't changed.

To the extent

9

they were seeking the return of their property through

10

such an injunction, that hasn't changed for those two

11

plaintiffs, Yunker and Williams.

12

response, Your Honor, and we will --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we rest our -- our

So am I forgetting, but

14

didn't this start out as a class action and wasn't the

claim -- wasn't the class action denied?

that's correct, Your Honor.

It was denied as moot,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And you didn't appeal

that?
MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Well, we didn't -- we

21

didn't appeal at all.

The plaintiffs appealed the

22

district court's order, which -- it was a single order

23

that granted -- I'm sorry -- that granted our motions to

24

dismiss and denied plaintiffs' motion for class

25

certification as moot.

That was the order.

They appealed the order -- they

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Excuse

Well, maybe we should --

we should ask the plaintiffs about that.

But you're

10

saying that the two cases that were defaulted are not

11

moot?

12

Isn't a default the end of it?
MR. CASTIGLIONE:

I'm saying they may not be

13

moot, Your Honor, in that the claim for relief has not

14

-- and they defaulted before, in at least one of the

15

cases, before the complaint was even filed.

16

has really changed in the status of their case.

17

believe Mr. Williams -- nothing has changed in his case

18

from the time the complaint was filed.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So nothing
I

You said in your opening

20

that there is just the one proceeding, and that's the

21

petition for forfeiture.

22

suggested that there is a means that these plaintiffs

23

could get back their property pending the ultimate

24

forfeiture proceeding.

25

hearing, a petition for return of their property.

But in your brief you

You mentioned a Slocum type

11
Alderson Reporting Company

So I

Official

1

don't understand your argument that there's one and

2

only procedure, the forfeiture procedure, when on the

3

other hand you are telling us that there is a means.

4

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Well, maybe I can explain,

5

and I think it also goes to the -- what is -- why

6

the 8,850 -- the use of 8,850 and the Barker speedy

7

trial factors makes sense.

8

issues are resolved is a civil forfeiture hearing, it's

9

true. But I think what Slocum does, just in a similar

10

way to how speedy trial factors operate, it gives the

11

claimant an opportunity to come in and ask the court to

12

tell the government to fish or cut bait.

13

file an action or release the property.

14

operates much the same way that the speedy trial factors

15

would operate in a criminal case.

16
17

The one hearing where these

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you either
I think it

And they -- and they can do

that before the -- before the time period has expired?

18

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

19

And they can certainly do that.

That's a remedy that's

20

available up until -- up until the forfeiture case is

21

filed, and from that -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

But surely your

23

position is going to be that the statutory procedure

24

pre-empts and takes the place of any Slocum hearing,

25

isn't it?

I mean, somebody comes in and files a
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

petition saying, here I'm raising this right under, you

2

know, an early 19th century procedure, and you're not

3

going to say, okay, here's our position or here's the

4

property.

5

forfeiture proceeding that is provided under Illinois

6

law.

7

You are going to say, wait until the

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Well, I -- the ­- what

8

Slocum does, Your Honor, we think -- we believe that

9

Illinois has recognized for at least over 50 years that

10
11
12
13
14
15

a property owner has a common law right to come in.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that was before the

statute was enacted.
MR. CASTIGLIONE:

That's certainly true,

Your Honor, but that -JUSTICE SCALIA:

The statute is a dead

16

letter if you allow a Slocum action.

17

need is a Slocum action, and the fact that the statute

18

says you have to wait for -- you know, that the

19

government has 40 days, is meaningless.

20
21

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

All you -- all you

Well, Slocum I think is a

way of getting into court, getting the government -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly.

It's a way of

defeating the statute.
MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Well, once -- once the

government does act, Your Honor, then at that point I'd
13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

say if in fact the government's being -- once the

2

government files a forfeiture action, if the

3

government's dilatory, there's remedies under ­ under

4

Illinois law, our Code of Civil Procedure, or even

5

perhaps a motion to dismiss for --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the statute says the

7

government isn't dilatory until -- until the time

8

period, 40 days.

9

if it doesn't mean that the government has 40 days?

10

It has 40 days.

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

What does that mean

think certainly, Your Honor, the government does have

12

the time periods.

13

government certainly has the time periods.

14

case were to somehow to fall through the cracks and

15

nothing would happen, I think what -- what the common

16

law remedies provide is a safety net for property owners

17

to be able to get into court.

Yes, I agree with that.

Before the 40 days?
No, I would say after the

Well, that's a

22

different story.

These people are asking for a hearing

23

before the elapsing of the 40 days, and if all -- if all

24

you say that Slocum provides is a hearing after the 40

25

days have elapsed and nothing has occurred, that doesn't

satisfy what they are asking for.

2

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

provides a hearing after 40 days, Your Honor.

say, if the government does nothing, it's a way of

5

getting into court.

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't have to do

anything for 40 days, is what the statute says.

I would

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

And we don't dispute that.

And --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you say if it -- you

11

don't dispute that doesn't have to do anything, but you

12

-- you assert that if it does nothing, you can bring a

13

Slocum action.

14

I mean, which is it?

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

One or the other?

Well, Slocum is an

15

equitable remedy.

16

think before the time has run out in our procedures one

17

could probably establish that, but it's possible if a

18

case were to -- were to fall through the cracks, and it

19

gives --

20

If someone can establish -- I don't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Slocum then is the

21

answer to a very different case.

It's a case where

22

you have a class action of people whose cases fell

23

through the cracks and never got the procedures they

24

were entitled to.

25

the claim that they are entitled to procedures before it

1

falls through the cracks.

2

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Well, our position, Your

3

Honor, is that the -- the statute -- is the regime that

4

Illinois has adopted with the time periods, does ­- does

5

comply with due process.

6

with some number of the issues Respondents have raised.

7

It provides a way of dealing

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't the basic

8

argument that you make that a forfeiture hearing is all

9

the process that is due?

10

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Yes, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now, let me ask you this

12

question:

13

forfeiture hearing with all the procedures you want, but

14

the forfeiture hearing shall take place 1 year after the

15

seizure.

16

Suppose your statute said there shall be a

Would that be adequate?
MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Under this Court's view --

17

decision in FDIC v. Mallen, I don't think you would look

18

to the outer limits, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

But I think --

Yes, I'm saying the

20

minimum.

The hearing will take place 1 year after the

21

seizure, nothing earlier or nothing later.

22

be constitutional?
MR. CASTIGLIONE:

Clearly, it's possible to

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

State's practice were to do so, but I would say --

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, there is no

6

practice, no background practice.

This is a new

7

statute.

8

hearing, as you describe it, that shall take place 6

9

months --

So this -- you have to have a forfeiture

10

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

One year later.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- or a year later.

12

Would

that be constitutional?

13

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

process in 8,850 --

Well, I understand what

I'm asking your view of that

19

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

I think -- I think --

20

And if you agree that it's

21

unconstitutional, then you have to agree that time is ­-

22

is relevant to the question whether the forfeiture

Ten years?

Ten years?
Well, no, I would say 10

years without any judicial intervention --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You've -- you've given up

11

the position, then.

12

we are just arguing over what the time is, whether it's

13

10 years, 1 year, or 40 days, right?

14
15

You've said time does matter.

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

So

Well, 40 days I think is

consistent, is I think a reasonable --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It may be, but that's a

17

different argument.

It's -- we have to consider whether the time period is

19

reasonable, right?

It's -- it's not an absolute.

sort of the typical case where the police officer

6

arrests someone in a vehicle for a drug offense and --

7

without a warrant -- and then has to file a complaint in

8

court.

9

What -- what is the government -- what is

10

the burden on the government, and what would be the

11

burden on Chicago or the State of Illinois in a

12

requirement that within some reasonably brief period of

13

time after that that there must be the equivalent of the

14

filing of a complaint in court, just as you would for

15

the arrest of an individual without a warrant, where the

16

only issue would be whether there was probable cause for

17

the seizure, not whether there, you know, is some

18

innocent owner defense, but just whether there's

19

probable cause?

20

MR. CASTIGLIONE:

I think there are several

21

burdens.

One, I think that hearing would be duplicative

22

of the ultimate forfeiture hearing.

23

adversarial hearing, it might be a way of doing, like, a

24

the line --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Look, I thought this case,

10

though I grant you I could well be wrong, is not about a

11

final forfeiture hearing where you have to show that

12

it's more probable than not that the car was used for

13

drugs.

14

17

circumstances.

19

is, is entitled to a hearing, I thought, in a brief time

20

to see if there was probable cause, just as a person

21

arrested.

within a short time to see if there's probable cause.

MR. JAY:

pointing out that it's not the law, because the State's

ultimate burden at the hearing is not preponderance of

the evidence; it's probable cause.

precisely the same burden that --

The constitutional justification,

Justice Breyer, requires that a reviewing court look at

MR. JAY:

Your Honor, there's more to

investigate than just the probable cause to seize.

5

many cases, the probable cause to believe the car is

6

forfeitable is ironclad, but there is more to

investigate because, for example, an innocent owner in

Illinois by statute is entitled not to have her car or

entitled to that time.

16

you, property owner, to go to a neutral magistrate who

will make that decision without a personal interest in

the outcome, because the person who seized does have an

interest of some sort.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In

appeals parties plead in the alternative and say, if you

class certification because we still want to proceed as

to be adjudicated and then filed a new class action.

14

It's a very different procedural step.

15

You didn't do that.

MR. PETERS:

You waited for the merits

I don't think that it is

16

significantly different when one considers the concerns

17

that animated the Court's decision in Geraghty.

18

concerns that were at issue in that case were the fact

19

that the plaintiff was representing a class that was

20

going to continue to exist and that as to that class

21

there was constantly going to be a claim repeating; and

22

that that person, even though the class was denied -- in

23

that case it truly -- it was denied on the merits,

24

because he had an opportunity to litigate the merits.

We did not have a -- opportunity to litigate the merits

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Peters, I think the

3

Court in Geraghty said it split the interests.

4

said his interests in challenging the denial of class

5

action status continued even though he was no longer

6

incarcerated.

7

So they were concentrating on his right to

8

appeal the denial of class action certification.

9

that's what you don't have here.

10

And they

And

And that's what

distinguishes this case from Geraghty.

11

MR. PETERS:

I -- I certainly agree that it

12

is not an identical situation, Your Honor.

13

think -- as I said before, I think again that the

14

concerns that caused the Court to reach that position in

15

Geraghty are in fact the same because in this case

16

the -- there is a continuing activity with respect to

17

the class.

18

who are aggressively pursuing the rights of that class.

19

There is a live controversy between the government and

20

that class.

22
23

But I

There is some -- there are a group of people

So in all of those respects, which are
similar to what -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. PETERS:

And that's all that's

That was -- that was all that

5

was before the Seventh Circuit because I don't -- it

6

seems to me that it is just sort of a gratuitous gesture

7

to say, I am appealing the denial of the class

8

certification ruling, when the class certification

9

ruling is itself based entirely on the denial of the

10

merits.

11

If there had not -- if there had been any

12

inkling, any ruling that suggested that the Rule 23

13

aspect, the class aspect, was being denied on

14

class-related grounds, then of course there would be an

15

appeal.

position, which is I'd like to see if it's practical

is your opponents are saying, no, you shouldn't really

address this issue now because there are three Illinois

2

statutes which actually give them, anyone who wants it,

a right to a hearing at least on probable cause.

4

that's a matter of Illinois law.

5

statutes don't seem to say it, they might.

And

And although the

6

And the second is that this seems mixed up

7

in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my

8

mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate

9

questions:

when you are entitled to a final hearing of

10

whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you

11

are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there

12

was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car.

13

Now, that latter question I think might be

14

impractical in many cases to work out until there's been

15

a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which

16

may be much later.

17

But the former question is where I think you

18

have a point, that there are five instances here in this

19

statute where a policeman could seize a car without a

20

warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of

them nonetheless.

not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to

the -- with respect to whether it's an adversarial

hearing, I -- what we envision is a hearing similar to

12

MR. PETERS:

Well, if there was -- my answer

13

to that, I think, Your Honor, is in two parts:

14

the Federal Government is already doing something like

15

that with the CAFRA.

16

part of the hearing could include showing by the car

17

owner or the property owner that they are in fact likely

18

to prevail as an innocent owner.

There are hardship provisions, and

thought the government said it doesn't apply to cash.

-- reason to believe that

people who are involved in drug forfeiture seizures are

19

people with modest to low incomes, probably little to no

access to attorneys.

a little abstract.

In the absolute concrete case, where

3

drugs in the car.

circumstances and that's the only car, I would say,

most likely, the property should be returned to the car

owner.

has some concerns about -- for example, that they need

innocent owner issue adjudicated at this quick hearing.

25

I can understand the argument that you have

complaint when you -- that has to be filed when someone

cause to believe that this car was involved in an

illegal activity, and this is why.

19

And then there is what sounds like, to me, a

sort of remission-type component to the hearing you are

looking at, which is a magistrate saying, okay, you have

probable cause, but there's no reason for the seizing

5

MR. PETERS:

Well, I wouldn't like to give

up my favorite baseball card, but the reason that I said

7

that, Your Honor, is this:

8

we are espousing here, require a cost-benefit analysis,

9

and if the value of the property under that -- using

10

that criteria does not warrant a hearing, then as to

11

that property, there shouldn't be a hearing.

The Mathews criteria, which

So it's as -- so

15

it's as applied in every case, which I think ties in a

16

little bit to the mootness question that we began with.

17

Because it focuses on the circumstances of the

18

individual claimants, and if the individual claimants

19

have already had their property returned, I think it

20

accentuates the mootness issue.

21

MR. PETERS:

I -- I continue to maintain,

22

Your Honor, that the -- as long as there was standing

23

when the case was filed, and as long as there is a live

24

class that could be represented by these class -- or

25

should call it.

5

"My potential class," you

MR. PETERS:

Potential class.

Yes, Your

Honor.
Then there is standing on -- and I believe

6

that the standing can be established through the

7

Geraghty decision.

8

identical to Geraghty, but I think the underlying

9

circumstances that animated the Court's decision in that

I agree that it is not literally

10

case are the same and that, therefore, these people

11

maintain standing.

12

If, however, in response to a question

13

that you asked Mr. Castiglione earlier, if the case

14

became moot as a result of the return of the property,

15

then it wouldn't be a Munsingwear situation.

16

be a Bancorp v. Bonner situation, because if it became

17

moot as a result of the settlement of the case after the

18

Seventh Circuit's decision, then the Seventh Circuit's

19

decision should stay in place.

20

It would

So if -- I do not agree that the case is

21

moot, but if hypothetically the case were moot, then we

22

are not in a Munsingwear situation; we are in a Bancorp

23

situation, because the mootness --

activity when the State law requires them to take

4

MR. PETERS:

No, what -- what I'm saying,

5

Your Honor, is if we're -- if we're defining mootness as

6

the ultimate return of the property, then the property

7

was returned pursuant to settlements in four of the

8

cases.

9

$20,000, if you return our car.

10

The plaintiffs agreed, we'll pay $400 instead of
The car was returned.

So if the case was settled and became moot

11

because of the settlement, it is not a situation in

12

which the Court can adopt the Munsingwear position.

13

really is a Bancorp situation, and the Seventh Circuit's

14

decision remains --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It

Of course, all of these

16

problems really arise out of the fact that the effect of

17

the court of appeals' decision basically was to overrule

18

the motion to dismiss, left everything open on remand.

19

So if we said it is moot, you'll just get another

20

plaintiff and bring another lawsuit, which is what you

21

do if the Court -- we are trying to get into the case

22

much earlier than we should, it seems to me.
