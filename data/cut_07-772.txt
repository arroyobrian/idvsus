CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Collins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. COLLINS:

9
10

Sarausad.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case comes before the Court under the

11

deferential standard of review of the Antiterrorism and

12

Effective Death Penalty Act.

13

should be reversed because the Washington court's

14

adjudication of this matter was not objectively

15

unreasonable.

16

instruction at issue properly informed the jury of the

17

elements of accomplice liability, and the prosecutor's

18

argument informed the jury that it could only convict

19

Sarausad if he acted with knowledge he was facilitating

20

the commission of a homicide.

21

The Ninth Circuit decision

The Washington court concluded that the

The court also concluded that the trial

22

judge did not abuse his discretion in directing the jury

23

to reread the relevant instructions instead of giving

24

the supplemental instruction proposed by Sarausad.

25

decision below was not an unreasonable application of
3

The

clearly established Federal law.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you think it was

right?

4

MR. COLLINS:

I do think it was right, Your

5

Honor, but I also believe that it was not objectively

6

unreasonable, which is the standard before this Court.

7

Turning to the PRP court's adjudication, the -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
constitutional minimum?

First, is there some

Let's assume direct review.

10

there some constitutional minimum requirement for

11

scienter with reference to an accomplice?

12
13

MR. COLLINS:

Is

I believe there is, Your

Honor.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. COLLINS:

What is it?

You have to have knowledge

16

that you're facilitating -- you have to act and you have

17

to have knowledge, both those two points.

18
19
20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that the same -- is

that the same as purpose?
MR. COLLINS:

I think it is, Your Honor.

21

think the model -- I think the Model Penal Code refers

22

-- uses the term "purpose" as opposed to "knowledge,"

23

but I don't think -

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but you don't take

the position, do you, or do you, that Washington law

I

conforms to the Model Penal Code?

2

Penal Code was much more defendant-friendly than you're

3

stating.

4
5

MR. COLLINS:

I thought the Model

I believe that's correct, Your

Honor.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you're -- would -

7

would you say that the trial court in Washington states

8

law correctly if it says that being accomplice you have

9

to have a purpose to facilitate the commission of the

10

crime?

11

MR. COLLINS:

I believe that you would have

12

to have -- you have to knowingly facilitate the crime,

13

Your Honor.

14
15
16

That's the JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you agree there is a

difference in "knowing" and "purpose"?
MR. COLLINS:

I'm not sure there is much of

17

a difference, Your Honor.

18

about that question, but I think you have to have that

19

mental component.

20

you have to do it with knowledge.

21

Frankly, I haven't thought

You have to either have purpose or

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the question is

22

knowledge of what.

And I thought it is now recognized

23

that in this State you have to know not just that a

24

crime -- you have to know in this case of the potential

25

for a homicide.

MR. COLLINS:

First degree -- a number of

10

assault with a deadly weapon, because there was one

11

13

First degree murder, second degree

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wouldn't assault with a

14

deadly weapon suffice or, alternatively, why would you

15

have to know that it was first degree murder or second

16

degree murder?

17

of the Washington statute that all you have to know is

18

that it was a homicide?

19

I don't know how you get from the text

MR. COLLINS:

Because the statute refers to

20

"the crime," so you have to have knowledge that you're

21

facilitating a homicide, but you don't have to have

MR. COLLINS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -- first degree murder,

second degree murder.

4

MR. COLLINS:

In Washington, you have to

5

have knowledge of the general crime that is homicide,

6

but you don't have to have the same knowledge as to

7

principle; therefore, you don't have to have knowledge

8

of premediation.

9

you're going to commit the general -- the general crime.

10

You just have to have knowledge that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How does that appear from

11

the statute?

13

If I read the statute, I would have

You could be convicted of

15

17

crime.

18

You have to have general knowledge of the

Let me give you another example.

In the

19

Davis case, for example, this was a robbery case, and

20

the defendants agreed to do a robbery, but the person

21

who went into the store had a gun.

22

didn't know that he had a gun, but still he was

23

convicted of armed robbery because he had a general

24

knowledge that robbery was going to be committed.

25

the other hand, if the principal had shot the store
7

The accomplice

On

1

owner, the defendant would not be an accomplice to

2

murder if his only knowledge was that he was

3

facilitating the crime of robbery.

4

So you have to have knowledge that you're

5

facilitating the general crime charged.

In this case

6

crimes charged were various kinds of homicides, first

7

degree murder, attempted murder.

8

record is very clear that the prosecutor argued that

9

Mr. Sarausad acted with knowledge that he was

And in this case, the

10

facilitating a homicide.

11

adjudication of that point is not objectively

12

unreasonable under the AEDPA standard.

13

Therefore, the PRP court's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This is -- the

14

prosecutor's charge -- the prosecutor's charge was just

15

filled with the suggestion that as long as it was a

16

crime, that was sufficient.

17

you've said is an accurate description of the charge -

I don't find that what

18

MR. COLLINS:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20
21

Your Honor -- of the prosecutor's

summation.
MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, the prosecutor

22

continually talked about the fact that they were going

23

there for the shooting.

24

joint appendix, the brown brief on page 123, the

25

prosecutor tells the jury when they rode down to Ballard

For example, in the -- the

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

High School the last time, "I say they knew what they

2

were up to.

3

Shouting insults didn't work.

4

work.

Fists didn't work.

Pushing didn't work.
Shooting was going to

In for a dime, in for a dollar."

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but isn't the problem

6

on your side of the case that there was another "in for

7

a dime, in for a dollar" argument and that was the

8

hypothetical holding the hands behind the back while

9

some third party slugged the victim?

And on that

10

hypothetical, there was no reference to a definite

11

crime.

12

under that hypothetical, there was no reference to the

13

crime, i.e., homicide, and so it seems to me that the

14

prosecutor's arguments, the dime-dollar arguments, went

15

both ways.

In that hypothetical the victim was killed, and

16

MR. COLLINS:

I disagree, Your Honor.

When

17

the prosecutor used the hypothetical, and in fact on

18

page 123 that I just quoted you, the prosecutor talks

19

about, in fact uses that dime for a dollar hypothetical,

20

and then immediately tells the jury that Mr. Sarausad

21

acted with knowledge that there was going to be a

22

homicide.

23

They went JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure, in that case.

But

24

there was another one in which the prosecutor didn't do

25

that.

MR. COLLINS:

I'm sorry.

Are you talking

2

about a different case, a case other than this, Justice

3

Souter?

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I did -- maybe I dreamed

5

this.

I thought the prosecutor also gave as a dime for

6

a dollar example the example of the individual, the

7

accomplice who holds a victim's hands while a third

8

party slugs the victim and in fact kills the victim.

9

And I thought in that hypothetical argument the

10

prosecutor was saying that the -- that the accomplice

11

was an accomplice to homicide, even though he didn't

12

know at the time the assault started that homicide was

13

intended or would result.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

subject.

18

necessarily correct.

19
20
21

And I have the same, I have the same, just

It seems to me that that hypothetical is not

MR. COLLINS:

The court, the PRP Court of

Appeals said that that hypothetical is problematic.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

22

instruction that follows the hypothetical, first the

23

statement that the person gets assaulted, gets killed,

24

in for a dime, in for a dollar?

25

Washington says if you're in for a dime you're in for a

The law in the State of

1

dollar; if you're there or even if you're not there and

2

you're helping in some fashion to bring about this

3

crime, you are just as guilty, in some fashion.

4

that was tied in to the person who thought he was

5

assisting in assault and it turns out that the victim

6

got killed.

7

MR. COLLINS:

Justice Ginsburg, the

8

hypothetical may be problematic, but you have to

9

consider -

10

And

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what about the

11

statement I just read, that the law of the State is you

12

don't even have to be there if you're helping in some

13

fashion.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where is that?

Yes.

22
23

It's not in the court's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No.

This is in the

summation.
MR. COLLINS:

Justice Ginsburg, the

24

prosecutor's argument responds to the argument made by

25

Sarausad's counsel that you had to have shared intent,

that Mr. Sarausad had to have the same intent as the

here, which is that the intention was to facilitate a

homicide, and you have to take the argument as a whole

12

which points to an "any crime" interpretation, and to

13

the extent that your case may ultimately turn on the

14

significance of the prosecutor's argument, it seems to

15

me that the benefit of the doubt goes to the defendant.

16

You've got an argument that points to a "the

MR. COLLINS:

Well, of course, Your Honor,

17

in this case my argument doesn't have to turn on that.

18

The question is whether this is an unreasonable

19

application and looking at the whole argument that the

20

prosecutor made, whenever the prosecutor used "dime for

21

a dollar" or that hypothetical, the prosecutor tied that

22

to shooting.

Mr. Sarausad was going to -

7

prosecutor always tied it to shooting, and moreover

8

that's the way the defense counsel argued the case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you help me with this?

Suppose I'm a trial judge and I instruct the jury in a

how mixed up the prosecutor has to get everybody before

Well, Your Honor, Brown v.

JUSTICE BREYER:

In Brown, in that case did

Alderson Reporting Company

they find that he did get them too mixed up or he

2

didn't?

3
4

MR. COLLINS:

He didn't get them too mixed

up so.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

He did not.

So unless in

6

this case the prosecutor got everybody more mixed up

7

than in the Brown case, we should just reverse.

8

MR. COLLINS:

Exactly.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Particularly -

What about the appellate

10

court?

I mean, the first time around the appellate

11

court was as mixed up, more so perhaps, than the

12

prosecutor.

13

MR. COLLINS:

Well, Your Honor -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because the appellate

15

court the first time got it wrong and it thought it was

16

enough that the defendant knew that a crime was likely

17

to be committed, not the crime, crime specified in the

18

indictment, not -- not murder one, attempted murder, et

19

cetera, just a crime.

20

appellate court said, yeah, we got it wrong, now we know

21

we got it wrong because there has been an intervening

22

decision of the State's supreme court clarifying it.

23

And the second time around that

But what the prosecutor said, at least as I

24

read it, more than once is exactly what the intermediate

25

appellate court said the first time around:
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Said he

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

didn't have to know that there was going to be a

2

shooting.

3

MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, the intermediate

4

appellate court did get it wrong the first time around.

5

But I think you have to consider the context, Your

6

Honor.

7

first time on accomplice liability was Mr. Sarausad's

8

claim that there had to be a shared intent, that is to

9

say you didn't have to know the crime.

10

The legal issue before the appellate court the

You had to have

committed.

15

MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, I think you have

16

to consider the context of the case.

17

the court of appeals was considering on direct review

18

was not the argument here.

19

you're looking at where the court said that it was not

20

necessary to prove shooting, the issue before the court

21

was Mr. Sarausad's claim that he was merely present,

22

that he didn't do anything.

23

responded by saying no, there is evidence that you may

24

have known of the fight, you may have known of the

25

shooting.

aside, the court said the State doesn't have to prove

2

shooting, but there is evidence of shooting.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did -- hadn't other

4

Washington State courts made a similar error in their

5

interpretation of the Washington statutes?

6

MR. COLLINS:

A few, a few court of appeals

7

decisions did misstate the standard, Justice Scalia,

8

that's correct.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the same -- and hadn't

10

the prosecutors in Washington in misstating the standard

11

the same way and using "In for a dime, in for a dollar"

12

to mean precisely the wrong thing, namely that even if

13

you were in for beating him up that's enough for holding

14

you liable for homicide?

15

MR. COLLINS:

16

19

Some prosecutors made that

argument, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Including this one in an

earlier case.
MR. COLLINS:

That's right.

But in Boyde

20

this Court pointed out that the fact that prosecutors in

21

other cases made improper arguments -- in Boyde

22

prosecutors were arguing about Factor K didn't allow

23

consideration of mitigation evidence.

MR. COLLINS:

And that would have been

wrong, Your Honor.

If -- if the trial judge -- there

are two things wrong with that -- wrong, Your Honor.

5

First of all, it would not have been accurate because

6

you don't know what the group activity is, and you don't

7

know what the knowledge is.

8

group activity was going back to the school to

facilitate a crime -

there is any ambiguity in that question.

that there couldn't be some ambiguity, but what we are

instructions as a whole and the argument as a whole and

16

the evidence as a whole, the PRP court's decision is not

objectively unreasonable.

some ambiguity there.

some ambiguity here.

the law is.

Of course, there is

I'll be candid to say that if I

It seems to be, if not misleading,

21
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Number two, the -- the second point in the

2

argument is, the jury comes back repeatedly, and

3

although, as you point out, it is -- it may well be a

4

proper answer to a jury request for clarification to

5

say, go back and read the instruction; the answer is

6

there.

7

questions that they are just not getting it, that they

still have perplexity, the court has got to do something

9

more than just say, oh, go back and do it again.

When it has been demonstrated by repeated jury

10

And number three, in this situation in which

11

there is ambiguity, there is a demonstration of jury

confusion.

13

which, in fact, is a two-part argument or a two-example

argument and it cuts both ways, isn't it objectively

reasonable to say under those circumstances that there

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MR. FISHER:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

please the Court:
The State is here today making what we think

3

is a rather extraordinary argument.

4

there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury in this

5

case interpreted the accomplice liability charge in the

6

same manner that the State itself urged the jury to

7

interpret it; that the State urged the Washington Court

8

of Appeals to interpret it on direct review in this case

9

and in many other cases, and how the Washington Court of

10
11

It's arguing that

Appeals in fact interpreted it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -- but is that

12

the standard?

13

it's not reasonably likely, but that's not the standard.

14

They have -- you have to show that it's objectively

15

unreasonable to show that the -- to assume that the

16

State got it correct.

17

You said there is -- they are saying that

MR. FISHER:

That's right, Your Honor.

So

18

there is a constitutional violation, and then our

19

burden, which we believe we can carry on the

20

extraordinary record in this case, is to show that a

21

court, the Washington Court of Appeals, could not have

22

reasonably concluded that there was a reasonable

23

likelihood the jury understood the charge in this case.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

When I read the opinion of

the Washington Court of Appeals, it does not seem to me
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that what they are doing is providing a literal

2

interpretation of the jury instruction, as I think we

3

have to presume the jury did when they got that

4

instruction.

5

Washington Court of Appeals is interpreting

6

Washington law.

7

Washington case law, which is what they cite.

8

don't -- they quote the instruction but they don't say

9

"the crime" means "a crime".

10
11

And they may be influenced by
They

That's how we interpret

the language of the instruction.
So there is an overlay of Washington case

12

law, principles of accomplice liability that inform this

13

instruction.

14

reasonable to argue that because they misinterpreted

15

Washington law, they were misinterpreting the literal

16

language of the jury instruction.

17

So I don't know that you can -- it's

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Alito, we think

18

it is fair to say that, because in the Washington Court

19

of Appeals decision, they start by laying out the

20

statutory language of Washington accomplice liability.

21

And remember, the jury instruction in this case simply

22

tracks that language.

23

State's argument.

That's, in fact, one of the

24

Now, our response to that argument is, just

25

as you said, Justice Alito, when a State supreme court,
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

as the Washington court later did in this case, steps in

2

and applies a gloss to that language and interprets it,

3

as this Court has said many times, it's as though that

4

language is written into the statute.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The gloss that the

6

Washington Supreme Court ended up with was exactly the

7

same as the instruction that was, that the judge gave in

8

this case -- to be as a -- the trial judge, whatever the

9

state of the law was, got it right.

10

MR. FISHER:

Got it right insofar as

11

regurgitated the language of the statute.

12

Washington law that would apply to this case -- and I

13

think there is an agreement on this, Justice Kennedy, is

14

that Mr. Sarausad has to know that he was promoting or

15

facilitating a homicide.

16

That's theory one of the State's -

17

But the

That's what he has to know.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's exactly what the

18

instruction said.

19

people, I understand, can read the same words and come

20

to different conclusions.

21

instruction and the statute, probably over a dozen times

22

by now, and I can't find the slightest ambiguity.

23

My problem is, I guess different

But I have read the

It seems to be absolutely clear.

What it

24

says is you're instructed that a person is guilty -- I

25

would say what crime is the jury considering -- of a
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

crime.

Namely, second-degree murder crime, if it is

2

committed by another person for which he is legally

3

accountable.

4

Then it says you're an accomplice -- an

5

accomplice -- it says a person is an accomplice with

6

certain knowledge when he aids another person in

7

planning or committing a crime; the crime, second-degree

8

murder.

9

What is the problem?

10

MR. FISHER:

The problem, Your Honor, is it

11

starts with this Court recognized him void.

12

lay people, and they understand things in terms of

13

common sense.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's a different

15

argument.

16

different categories.

17

ambiguity in this instruction?

18

which is what I was asking you, is zero.

19

Juries are

I want to know first -- in my mind in two
Category one:

Is there an

And my answer so far,
Why not?

And then the second question is, could the

20

prosecution get people so mixed up about something, a

21

typical thing like this, that it would violate due

22

process?

23

said, obviously the answer is sometimes they could.

24
25

That's why I asked the question before.

And I

And then the question is, did they here?
And what he referred me to was Brown, which I've looked
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

at, in which I said the prosecutorial and problem in

2

that case did not rise to a federal due process

3

question.

4

you would have to convince me that this is somehow worse

5

prosecutorial conduct than existed in Brown.

So, I guess -- though it's only one person -

6
7
8

MR. FISHER:

two steps, Justice Breyer.

9
10
11

Let me take your question in

JUSTICE BREYER:

All my questions from the

whole case.
MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

First I want to

12

emphasize we are not alleging prosecutorial misconduct

13

in this case in any way.

14

The problem is -

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

But what I mean by

15

that is that the prosecution would have had to have

16

gotten the jury more mixed up than -- I was using

17

shorthand for that -

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20
21

Right.
-- more mixed up than they

did in Brown, where I thought it was pretty bad.
MR. FISHER:

That's right.

Let me -- all I

22

meant to say was the prevailing view in the State at the

23

time of this trial was that any crime was sufficient,

24

and so that's why the prosecutor was entitled to make

25

that argument.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Let me take your question in two steps,

2

first the ambiguity in the language.

3

courts themselves and as the States themselves argue at

4

page 38 and 39 of the appendix of our red brief, you can

5

interpret the language in the statute, when you get to

6

words "the crime", to mean one of two things:

7

As the Washington

One, it could mean as you said, Justice

8

Breyer, that the particular crime the principal

9

committed; or it could mean one could understand it to

10

mean simply the principal's criminal conduct.

11

Washington -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And in

In my -- it it doesn't mean

13

either.

14

person is guilty of a crime -- in other words, the jury

15

is sitting there and they are asked the question:

16

the person guilty of second-degree murder?

17

It means jury you are instructed that the

Now they are to apply the instruction.

A

18

person is guilty of second-degree murder if da, da, da,

19

da.

20

second-degree murder.

21

it could be referring to.

22

And when it gets to "the crime", it is referring to

MR. FISHER:

I don't know how -- anything else

Well, maybe the best that I can

23

do, Justice Breyer, is refer you to empirical evidence

24

from the State itself, from the State of Washington, and

25

if you need one further thing to look at, I commend to
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you the Supreme Court decision of the Supreme Court of

2

Colorado that cited in the actual brief -- there was

3

language exactly like this that comes to a textual

4

analysis and comes to the conclusion.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're convincing me that

6

different people can reach different conclusions.

What

7

I'd like you to say is something that would change my

8

mind on my initial conclusion that there is no

9

ambiguity.

I think you could say something like that,

10

because as you quite rightly point out, other people

11

have reached other conclusions.

12

MR. FISHER:

Because the articles "a" and

13

"the" are simply not definite enough.

14

the words "the crime" to simply mean criminal conduct.

15
16
17

And you can read

Now, let me talk about the prosecutor's
argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You might be able to

18

and you might -- as I understood you to say earlier, you

19

could read it one way or you could say it another way.

20

And if that's the case, it's hard to say that reading it

21

one way is objectively unreasonable when the State court

22

reads it that way.

23

MR. FISHER:

I think if that's all we had,

24

Mr. Chief Justice, you would be exactly right.

25

me turn now 31
Alderson Reporting Company

So let

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it is not

2

objectively unreasonable for the State to instruct

3

jurors as they did?

4

would be the point.

5

If that's all you had, then that

MR. FISHER:

Right.

Right.

Because the

6

test that this Court has repeated many times is whether

7

there is a reasonable likelihood that this jury

8

misapplied the instruction.

9

Now, let me turn to the prosecutor's

10

argument, because there was a lot of discussion about

11

that in the first half an hour.

12

There is two places in the joint appendix

13

that you might want to pay attention to, and I think we

14

might have been referring to two different places

15

earlier.

16

makes her opening argument and says -- and uses the

17

assault analogy of holding somebody's arms behind their

18

back.

19

Ginsburg was reading -- this is the law of the State of

20

Washington.

21

In joint appendix page 38, the prosecutor

And she tells the jury this is -- as Justice

And again, in direct rebuttal at page 123 of

22

the joint appendix, the prosecutor again says very

23

specifically -- specifically to the jury, let me talk to

24

you about the accomplice liability instruction.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Was there an objection?

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MR. FISHER:

There were objections both

before and after.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The objection was based on

4

the defense proffer of an instruction which was, namely,

5

close to the model penal code that says you have to have

6

the same -- is anterior principle, and that's not

7

necessarily the law in every state.

8
9
10

So the defense bears some responsibility for
not -- for -- number one, it didn't have a coherent
theory either.

11

MR. FISHER:

There were times where

12

Mr. Sarausad's counsel, you're right, did ask for a

13

little more than he was entitled to.

14

counsel made objections directly on point, which

15

Mr. Sarausad joined, and as Justice Ginsburg noted

16

earlier, when the jury comes back with the third

17

question that is precisely on point, it's precisely the

18

question on which that whole entire case turns -- and I

19

might add there would be no reason for the jury to ask

20

that third question, what kind of knowledge is required

21

in this case, if they had decided, as the State argues,

22

that Mr. Sarausad knew a homicide was going to be

23

committed.

But Mr. Reyes'

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

your reading of question three is definitive.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't think that
I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's like the instruction, the jury could read it one of

2

two ways.

3

could be whether others could have had an intent, in

4

other words, others in the group, not simply -- it

5

doesn't show that the accomplice doesn't have to have

6

the requisite intent.

7

If you look at question three, the issue

MR. FISHER:

Well, we think it's pretty

8

clear, Mr. Chief Justice.

I think the more important

9

sentence may be the one that precedes that question,

10

which is the jury tells the court, after seven days of

11

deliberations:

12

legal definition and concept of accomplice.

13
14

We are having difficulty agreeing on the

Now, that is the question -- and let me
return to the prosecutor's argument -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's not the

16

question.

17

first two questions point in the opposite direction.

18

They do not say we don't know whether it's "the crime"

19

or "a crime".

20

three focus on that.

21

There are a number of areas, and I think the

Their questions, neither one, two or

It's a more general question that we could

22

read the opposite way.

23

you are, even though it doesn't say is it "the crime" or

24

"a crime".

25

Perhaps you can read it the way

But there again, I think it's incorrect to
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

say it's quite clear that the question -- and certainly

2

not questions one and two, I mean question three is your

3

strongest one -- but it's still not clear that they are

4

focusing on the "the/a" issue.

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think the best we can

6

do, because we have to make reasonable inferences from

7

the record and he we can't go back and ask the jurors

8

what we thought, is we have to make, as the court has

9

done many times, reasonable inferences as to what they

10

are doing.

11

record, even if it's not absolutely clear, is that the

12

jury was honing in progressively on the central issue in

13

this case, and that was Mr. Sarausad's mens rea.

14

And I think the fairest reading of this

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, then, what I take is

15

authoritative on that are two sentences from the

16

Washington Supreme Court opinion, though people -- other

17

judges have been all over the lot.

18

it says:

19

that it could convict Mr. Sarausad of murder -- they

20

mean second-degree murder -- as an accomplice only if it

21

found he knowingly aided in commission of "the crime"

22

charged, which was second-degree murder.

23

interpretation, which I could understand.

24
25

The first sentence

The trial court correctly instructed the jury

That's their

Then the second thing is, it does not offend
the principles of accomplice liability to hold
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

responsible one who knowingly aids such conduct; namely,

2

conduct that creates a substantial risk of death when

3

the substantial risk of death results in actual death.

4

So that would seem to be hornbook law.

If

5

you engage in conduct that might well cause substantial

6

or -- substantial risk of death and you know it, you

7

know, you know you're engaging in this conduct, that's

8

the Washington view, that's it.

9

You've had it.

And here they go on to say that he knew

10

there was plenty of evidence that he knew that he was

11

engaged in a drive-by shooting.

12

dot on every "I", they say a drive-by shooting does run

13

a substantial risk of death.

14

And then to put every

Okay.

Now that's what I read and at that point, I

15

said I'll ask you that, because then I can hear the best

16

answer.

17

MR. FISHER:

Your Honor, we are not

18

challenging -- or this Court does not have authorities

19

the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, so there

20

might be enough evidence in the record for the jury to

21

have found that.

22

that?

23

light of the arguments made to the jury by the

24

prosecutor and the jury's own questions trying to sort

25

through them, this case -- whether the jury actually

But the question is, did the jury find

And we can't know from the instructions given in

36
Alderson Reporting Company

1

found that.

2

again to the prosecutor's argument.

3

And so if the State wanted -- this goes

There is two things that I think we might be

4

conflating improperly here.

There is the first question

5

of what the prosecutor argued to the jury Washington law

6

meant.

7

123, there is no doubt what the prosecutor was arguing

8

to the jury Washington law meant.

It meant as she said,

9

"in or a dime, in for a dollar."

If you hold somebody's

And I suggest to you if you look at JA 38 and JA

10

arms behind their back thinking that an assault is going

11

to occur and the person dies, you can be found guilty of

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I ask you this

having difficulty agreeing on a legal definition and

concept of accomplice; when a person willingly

Suppose that the judge had answered that

question by saying a person who participates in group

5

activity is guilty of the crime of second degree murder

6

if the person acts with knowledge that his or her

conduct will promote or facilitate the commission of the

MR. FISHER:

Yes, under the particular

2

circumstances in this case, because the jury expressed

3

confusion.

4

the only reason they would have asked that is if they

5

had not found the facts the State alleges, at least at

6

that point, that Mr. Sarausad knew a murder was going to

7

occur, and also because we know the prosecutor argued

8

the exact opposite to them.

9

the question -- another way to put it, I think which is

10

a fair characterization is, is what the prosecutor told

us correct?

So we know the jury was confused.

event that you know there is a substantial risk of comes

I think correctly, that if

I would be amazed that a State would say the

contrary.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And your answer to Justice

12

Breyer incorporated the -- the principle that the

13

defense counsel had been arguing for from the outset of

this case, that you must have the same scienter as the

the defense agreed that if Mr. Sarausad knew there was a

4

gun in his car, or if he knew that the fellows were

5

planning on killing somebody, that he could have been

6

found guilty.

7

That he knew, and it was argued to this case,

That was the very -- that was the central

8

issue in this case; and when the State stands up and

11

the prosecutor's arguments on the facts.

the jury had is what Washington law is, the prosecutor

What's the difference

between that and punching him in the stomach?

MR. FISHER:

Because when somebody is

punched in the stomach there is no reasonable belief

5

that the person is going to be put in grave risk of

6

death.

7

the whole entire case was about, and that the jury was

8

demonstrably perplexed about, was what did Mr. Sarausad

9

know.

And so as I said, the issue of this case, that

10

And when the State says, well -- the

11

prosecutor argued to the jury that he knew their

12

shooting was going to happen or that he knew a gun was

13

in the car, if the jury had believed that they could

14

have come back with a guilty verdict in 30 minutes; but

15

instead they asked a series of questions culminating in

16

the one after seven days of deliberation which can only

17

be interpreted as suggesting that we don't believe that

18

Mr. Sarausad knew that the worst was going to happen

19

here, and we are struggling to figure out what kind of

20

verdict we have to render in light of that.

jury this is what the State of Washington law requires.

3

And as this Court has recognized in other cases, the

4

prosecutor isn't just any old lawyer standing in front

5

of a jury.

6

imprimatur of the government; and so we think it's

7

perfectly reasonable for the jury to have understood the

8

prosecutor to be arguing this is what the law is, and at

9

the very least to have created a question in their

10
11

First, the prosecutor herself kept telling the

The prosecutor carries with her the

minds.
And if I contrast this case with Brown

12

against Payton, because Justice Breyer has asked about

13

that case and it is another case where the prosecutor

14

made what this Court found was a misleading argument to

15

the jury, there you have a very different situation.

16

Not only do you have no jury questions at all coming in

17

that case to demonstrate to the Court that the jury was

18

in fact confused and likely to follow the prosecutor's

19

advice, but you have a very different scenario in Brown,

20

where this Court said that in light of the way that case

21

was actually argued, the prosecutor was really making

22

more of an argument on the facts, that these arguments

23

the defendant has made shouldn't really be considered

24

mitigating evidence in your deliberations; and as this

25

Court said the jury must have taken it as a factual
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument because otherwise the whole mitigation hearing

2

would have been totally unnecessary.

3

Now, under the -- under the facts of this

4

case, the way this case was tried -- and again I want to

5

emphasize that at the time this case was tried, the

6

prosecutor had the better of the argument as to what

7

Washington law is.

8

This case is only before you because it's

9

the oddball case, and the only one I can think of that's

10

like it is when this Court had in about 2000, or decided

11

in 2001, called Fiore v White, when in Pennsylvania the

12

State brought a prosecution and obtained a conviction

13

for discharging hazardous waste without a permit, and

14

then the Pennsylvania Supreme Court later said that not

15

having a permit is required under the statute.

16

enough to prove to the jury that he so deviated from the

17

permit that -- that no permit existed.

18

Court said once we know that clarification under State

19

law, we look back and it's clear as day that the jury

20

didn't find that element.

21

It's not

And then this

Now the only difference between that case

22

and this case is that in Fiore it was absolutely certain

23

the jury didn't find the element and the prosecution

24

didn't argue otherwise.

25

evidence and ambiguity in the jury instructions that the

Here you have enough ambiguous

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State was trying to backfill after it has lost the case

2

in the Washington Supreme Court and say no, the jury in

3

this case even though we told them they didn't have to

4

find it, did go ahead and find it.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the only difference

6

between that case, which I know very well, and this case

7

is that in that case there was no issue about jury

8

instructions.

9

MR. FISHER:

10
11

Well, not directly.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what's the relevance of

it?

12

MR. FISHER:

Right.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, the relevance -

Has to do with the

14

retroactivity whether a State can -- whether

15

Pennsylvania had changed the interpretation of its

16

statute, or whether what they said it meant was what it

17

always had meant.

18

MR. FISHER:

That's right, Justice Alito and

19

I know that you know that case.

The -- you're right.

20

So we are on all fours with Fiore in the sense that the

21

later decision from the State Supreme Court applies

22

retroactively, and in Fiore what you would have had, the

23

court didn't need to talk about jury instructions,

24

because I take it that the jury was instructed in Fiore

25

that deviating substantially from a permit satisfies the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

no-permit element of that defense, and so the jury was

2

given there, simply an instruction that was simply

3

wrong.

4

And here our contention is that the -- that

5

the jury charge taken in light of the case was

6

ambiguous, but that distinction doesn't matter because

7

as this Court has said in Boyde and Estelle and many

8

other cases, all you have to show is a reasonable

9

likelihood that the jury misunderstood the charge.

10

Now we have to show an additional layer of

11

unreasonableness because we are on habeas now and no

12

longer on direct review, but for all the reasons that

13

are apparent on the face of this record this is the

14

extraordinary case.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Fisher, can I just ask

16

you a question?

17

is troubling the jury was whether they had to find that

18

the driver of the car knew that there was a gun in the

19

car.

20

Is it your view that the question that

MR. FISHER:

There's two ways to think about

21

it.

Yes, that could be one way to think about it.

The

22

other way that they might have been thinking about it

23

was whether he knew that a murder was going to happen

24

and that a killing was going to happen.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Assume proof of the gun in

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the car was enough to prove -

2
3

MR. FISHER:

That's the way the case was

presented to the jury.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It wouldn't -- and that's

5

what presumably may have taken a lot of time

6

deliberating whether or not he knew there was a gun.

7
8

MR. FISHER:
The defendant -

9
10

That's right, Justice Stevens.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And in one theory it makes

a difference; in another theory it doesn't.

11

MR. FISHER:

Precisely.

And the defense

13

if you find he knew there was a gun in the car, then we

14

lose.

15

about the three jury questions about what the law meant.

16

Remember the jury earlier asked to have Mr. Sarausad's

17

testimony reread back to them.

18

indication is you have a jury really trying very, very

19

hard to do their job.

20

And, remember, the jury earlier -- we've talk

So, again, every

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, AEDPA of

course requires that this be an unreasonable application

22

of clearly established Federal law.

23

established Federal law that was unreasonably applied?

24
25

MR. FISHER:

What is the clearly

It's the rule that is stated -

again, at page 32 of the State's brief with which we
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agree -- that if there is a reasonable likelihood that

2

the jury applied instructions so as to violate the

3

Constitution, then that violates due process.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

So that's

articulated at a fairly general level.

6

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In Yarborough, we've

8

said that the more general the rule, the more leeway

9

courts have in reaching outcomes in a case-by-case

10

determination.

11

find an unreasonable application, the court has broad

12

leeway because it is a general rule.

13

said that the instruction does not establish

14

unreasonable application.

15

So you have a very general rule, and to

And you've already

Given that, isn't it pertinent, although

16

people have objected -- you've objected to the idea

17

that, well, all they did was send them back with the

18

instruction.

19

you said could be reasonably interpreted correctly.

20

why isn't that -- why doesn't that -- given the leeway

21

the State court has because this is a general rule, why

22

isn't that sufficient to refute the idea of unreasonable

23

objective?

24
25

So they sent them back with something that
So

Yes.
MR. FISHER:

The State would have a better

argument if nothing else had happened in this trial
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other than simply the jury had been given that

2

instruction, but our point is, and then this Court

3

recognizes as much, I think, in Brown against Payton,

4

that the prosecutor's arguments do matter.

5

be considered in the calculus.

6

Estelle that instructions cannot be considered in

7

isolation.

8

of the way the case was tried.

9

They are to

And this Court said in

They have to be considered in the totality

And so my point, Mr. Chief Justice, is the

10

reason why the State cannot show that the State court of

11

appeals decision was reasonable is because it's not just

12

the instruction that had perplexed the State and

13

Washington courts over the years; it's the fact that the

14

prosecutor asked the jury to adopt the wrong

15

interpretation of the instruction and that the jury came

16

back and told the court -- I think -- maybe it helps to

17

think about the case this way:

18

deliberation -- now I understand that we can dispute a

19

little bit what the jury was asking, but I think a fair

20

statement is that after seven days of deliberation, the

21

jury was telling the court at a minimum there's a

22

reasonable likelihood we don't understand accomplice

23

liability in this case and that we are going to find

24

that as long as Sarausad was a member of this gang and

25

willingly participated in gang activity, that that's

After seven days of

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

enough to hold him liable for accomplice murder.

2

that's what the State had argued alternatively, Your

3

Honor.

4

And

So after seven days, there's no guesswork

5

that's even required.

We know the jury was confused and

6

going down the wrong path.

7

State can rescue that is to say that, upon being told to

8

read the same charge that it been told to read three

9

previous times, that suddenly the light bulb went off so

And so the only way the

10

dramatically that it reduced its confusion below the

11

50/50 level.

12

against Payton.

13

50/50.

14

Now that's what this Court said in Brown
The reasonable likelihood test is below

So we think if you were the Washington Court

15

of Appeals -- and I think this is another way to ask

16

yourselves the question you have to decide in this case.

17

If you were the Washington Court of Appeals on this

18

record, would it be reasonable for you to say that this

19

jury was not even reasonably likely to misunderstand the

20

accomplice liability instruction in this case?

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You've already said

22

that the instruction doesn't get you there.

23

heard you say that, with respect to the questions, we

can dispute what the jury was asking.

if you can read the instruction correctly, if it's -- if

2

you can't tell what the jury was asking, you don't know

that they were reflecting the confusion you have here.

4

So is all you're left with the prosecutor's statements?

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, we have all three, but I

6

don't want to give away too much.

I think it is fair to

7

say that the jury's third question is perfectly clear.

8

I hedged a minute to be frank so that I could

9

acknowledge the Court's earlier questions and get -- and

10

get my statement out, but in all honesty, I think that

11

the third jury question makes it clear that the jury is

12

confused.

13

Payton, unlike Weeks against Angelone, we have this

14

amazing constellation of all these mutually -

15

But we have -- again, unlike Brown against

JUSTICE BREYER:

This argument -- I'm

16

beginning to get your argument.

The statement is -- the

17

prosecutor never suggested Mr. Sarausad could be found

18

guilty if he had no knowledge that a shooting was to

19

occur.

20

no support for that in the record.

21

prosecutor was arguing is that, even if a shooting

22

didn't occur, he's still guilty because of other gang

23

activity, and when we read the record, we find that's so

24

wrong the statement in the supreme court opinion, that

25

habeas was right.

You're saying that's absolutely wrong.
