 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE VAN AKEN

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MS. VAN AKEN: 

and may it please the Court: 

11

 This 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

Ms. Van Aken, before you go 


any further. 

14

 (Laughter.) 

15

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, Justice Scalia. 
Your petition for  for 

17

writ of certiorari  and it was a petition that had 

18

your name on it, said on  on the reasons for granting 

19

the petition, this Court should resolve whether and how 

20

the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to arrests 

21

of armed and violent suspects who are disabled.  The 

22

circuits are in conflict on this question.  The question 

23

presented is recurring and important, and Title II of 

24

the ADA does not require accommodations for armed and 

25

violent suspects who are disabled, and that's the issue

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

on which there is a circuit conflict. 
 I now look at the Table of Contents of your 

3

petition.  This argument is not made in the petition at 

4

all.  You  you concede that  that Title II does 

5

apply even to the arrest of  of armed and dangerous 

6

suspects.  You just say in this case, "Modification to 

7

Sheehan's arrest would not have eliminated the 

8

significant risk she posed." 

9

 There  there's a technical word for this. 

10

It's called baitandswitch.  We might well not have 

11

granted this petition had you not listed those reasons. 

12

Are we supposed to appoint somebody else to argue the 

13

point that you asked  asked us to resolve in the 

14

in  in your petition for certiorari? 

15

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

With respect, Justice Scalia, 

16

San Francisco asked you to resolve the question of 

17

whether and how the ADA applies to the arrest an armed 

18

and  of an armed and violent individual, and the 

19

answer to that question is it only applies where the 

20

significant threat that the individual poses has been 

21

eliminated.  And 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's  that's not what 

23

your  that's not what your petition said.  Title II 

24

does not require accommodations for armed and violent 

25

suspects who are disabled, period, is what it says.  And

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that is not the argument you are  you  you make in 

2

your  in  in your principal brief. 

3

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Well, with respect, 

4

Justice Scalia, page 3 of our reply in support of 

5

certiorari  so still at the certiorari stage  says 

6

that the issue here is not a factintensive 

7

reasonableness question, but instead, it's whether an 

8

armed and violent individual's accommodation is 

9

required.  And the answer to that is no, where the 

10

significant risk hasn't been eliminated.  And our 

11

arguments at the certiorari stage certainly didn't turn 

12

on any claim that the ADA simply 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I  I 

14

looked at your papers below, and there, there was an 

15

argument as to whether the ADA applied at all to 

16

arrests.  And nowhere do you raise the direct threat 

17

argument; nowhere do you raise  raise below the risk 

18

argument.  It was a pure legal question, the one I 

19

thought we were going to answer. 

20

 But on appeal, you're now using the words 

21

"direct threat" and  and "risk."  What are we supposed 

22

to do with this? 

23

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

Justice Sotomayor 
We're supposed to 

change the  the nature of the case and perhaps reverse

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Ninth Circuit on an argument that was never 

2

presented to it? 

3

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

I  I disagree, Your Honor. 

4

In the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco argued that the 

5

the Ninth Circuit should adopt essentially the Fifth 

6

Circuit's rule, that where there are exigent 

7

circumstances, that there is no requirement of 

8

accommodation.  There was no argument that the ADA just 

9

has nothing to do with arrests.  It's that in exigent 

10

arrests, like the Fifth Circuit said in Hainze, then you 

11

don't  there's not a reasonable accommodation.  No 

12

accommodation is reasonable. 

13

 So in a sense, the ADA doesn't apply, but 

14

that's because of the exigency as the Fifth Circuit said 

15

in Hainze, and that was the conflict that we asked this 

16

Court to take the case to resolve. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Before we get to the 

18

question that you have briefed and the question that the 

19

Solicitor General has briefed, there is another question 

20

that logically comes first.  The statute, 42 U.S.C. 

21

12132, says, "No qualified individual with a disability 

22

shall, by reason of such disability, be subjected to 

23

discrimination by any such entity."  That's the relevant 

24

statutory provision, isn't it? 

25

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Yes, Justice.  Yes.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  So all we have 

2

there is discrimination.  In the  is there any 

3

provision of the ADA that defines what is meant by 

4

discrimination in that context?  Not in the employment 

5

context, in that context. 

6

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Right.  Congress's findings 

7

included a statement that discrimination includes a 

8

failure to make modifications in some circumstances.  So 

9

we understand discrimination to include a failure to 

10
11
12
13
14

modify a government program 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  Where does that 

appear?  Is that in the statute? 
 MS. VAN AKEN: 

It's  it's 12101(a)(5), 

Your Honor. 42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(5). 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Okay. 
And that's a finding that 

17

discrimination includes not making an accommodation. 

18

And this Court has recognized that accommodation is part 

19

of the discrimination analysis.  In  in Olmstead, for 

20

instance, the Court said that Congress had a broad view 

21

of what discrimination meant. 

22

 So let  let me return to my original 

23

point, which was that  that the case is about an 

24

entry, and police officers here sought to reenter a 

25

private home of a mentally ill woman who had just 

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, before you get to 

2

that, I  I'm still not entirely satisfied with your 

3

answer about discrimination.  We have to answer that 

4

question before we get to the arguments that you make 

5

and that the United States makes based on regulations 

6

that have been issued pursuant to the statute. 

7

 If discrimination means what it means in 

8

ordinary parlance, which means treating people 

9

differently, then there would be no basis for those 

10

regulations.  But nobody's briefed this other issue, 

11

this threshold issue.  Now, maybe you're right.  But it 

12

hadn't been briefed. 

13

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Well, I  I think 

14

discrimination includes the failure to make an 

15

accommodation where it's reasonable to do so, and I base 

16

that on the findings, as I mentioned.  I base that on 

17

the regulations, which this Court said in  in Bragdon 

18

were entitled to deference, at least in the  the 

19

public accommodations context.  Congress has recognized 

20

the reasonable accommodation duty in 42 U.S.C. 12206, 

21

which  which was subsequently enacted but mentions 

22

accommodations. 

23

 And I also think it  it sort of follows 

24

from this context.  The public service here is providing 

25

an injuryfree arrest to the extent possible.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Ms. Sheehan alleges that because of her disability, she 

2

wasn't able to take advantage of that public service to 

3

the extent other people would have been able to, but if 

4

we had provided her an accommodation, then she would 

5

have been able to.  Now, we  we disagree with that 

6

factually, of course. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8
9
10

Excuse me.  What  what is 

the public service that she could not 
 MS. VAN AKEN: 

An injuryfree arrest.  An 

arrest with a minimum of  of force. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

This is a public service? 
It's an activity, Justice 

13

Scalia.  And  and it's an activity in the same sense 

14

that imprisoning someone is a public activity, and this 

15

Court said in  in Yeskey that  that that indeed was. 

16

And so therefore, the ADA applied. 

17

 The service at issue here, the activity at 

18

issue here is an arrest, but the circuits are unified 

19

that Title II applies to arrest.  Where they're divided 

20

is how 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

instead of a service. 

23

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

24

call it an activity. 

25

 (Laughter.)

Let's call it an activity 

Yes, Justice Scalia.  Let's

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I  I have another 

preliminary question. 
 The ADA does not apply to the individual 
officers; right?  It applies to the entity. 

5

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
So this  the scenario 

7

we presented are actions taken on the spot by two 

8

officers.  Is  what is the entity liability?  Is this 

9

a vicarious liability? 

10

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

It's  it's a respondeat 

11

superior type of liability, and  and I believe  it's 

12

certainly clear in the Ninth Circuit that the city is 

13

liable for the individual actions of its officers.  The 

14

Monell doctrine only applies in the context of 42 U.S.C. 

15

1983. 

16

 So we accept for purposes here that where 

17

the officers are engaged in purposeful conduct on behalf 

18

of the entity that the entity is liable for  for 

19

their 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So you're not making the 

21

argument that the entity would be liable for a pattern 

22

or practice of discrimination, but not what the officer 

23

on the beat does? 

24
25

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

No.  I'm not making that 

argument.  I'm not making that argument.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And while we are talking 

2

about questions that are not strictly speaking in the 

3

case 

4

 (Laughter.) 

5

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, Justice Kagan. 
What is your view of when 

7

you are liable for monetary damages?  What is the 

8

standard on that? 

9

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Right.  So the  the ADA 

10

adopts the Rehabilitations Act remedies, which in turn 

11

adopts the Title VI remedies, so the city is liable in 

12

damages when it has engaged in intentional conduct.  And 

13

the Ninth Circuit has expanded that to include 

14

deliberate indifference as well.  And  and we think 

15

that here if the conduct is purposeful, if the officers 

16

are intentionally making an arrest rather than 

17

refraining from making an arrest in a  in the moment, 

18

then that conduct is purposeful for purposes of the 

19

remedy discussion. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

As long as they are 

21

intentionally making the arrest, do you think that that 

22

meets the standards that 

23

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

I think if they are on notice 

24

that there's  there might be an occasion to provide an 

25

accommodation, and they nonetheless make the arrest,

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then that meets the standard, I believe.  I think that's 

2

the case in the Ninth Circuit.  It's County of Duvall v. 

3

Kitsap 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It isn't that the 

5

institution must be purposeful, that it must be a policy 

6

of the institution?  It's enough if the actor, the 

7

officer in question, acted purposefully? 

8
9

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Well, that was certainly the 

assumption of the Ninth Circuit here, Justice Scalia. 

10

That  that the entire liability issue in this case 

11

turns on whether the officers failed to make a 

12

reasonable accommodation. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14
15

You don't  you don't 

challenge that?  You think that 
 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Not in this case.  We don't 

16

challenge that in this case.  That's a  that's a rule 

17

in the Ninth Circuit. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you  you want us to 

19

assume that Title II applies, and then to say that in 

20

this case, however, because of this particular 

21

individual's behavior, there was an exemption from that 

22

normal application of Title II.  And then we will decide 

23

in some future case whether it's true that Title II 

24

applies at all; right?  That's 

25

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

I think Title II applies

12

Alderson Reporting Company

1

here.  If  I think the Court 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

your  in your petition. 

4

You didn't say so in 

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

I respectfully disagree, 

5

Justice Scalia.  We argued about how Title II applies to 

6

this case, and we argued that it did not apply  it did 

7

not create a duty here because of the degree of 

8

exigency. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Title II of the ADA does 

10

not require accommodations for armed and violent 

11

suspects who are disabled. 

12
13
14

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Correct.  Now, that is not an 

argument 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You're not  you're not 

15

arguing that here.  You are saying in the circumstances 

16

of this case, is all you're saying. 

17

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I am arguing that 
Is it  is it enough that 

19

the individual was armed and dangerous?  Is that alone 

20

enough? 

21

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Yes.  That is enough because 

22

the individual was armed and dangerous.  If there  if 

23

the individual had been disarmed, Title II would create 

24

an obligation.  If the individual were not dangerous, 

25

Title II would create an obligation.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, what about this case? 

2

Suppose that there is an armed and dangerous person who 

3

the officer knows is deaf, and the officer says put your 

4

hands up or I'll shoot. 

5

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
And, of course, the deaf 

7

person doesn't put his hands up and the officer shoots. 

8

Is that  I guess you are saying that the ADA has 

9

nothing to do with that case. 

10

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

I  if the person is 

11

dangerous in that moment and it is necessary to shoot to 

12

protect public safety such as if the armed and violent 

13

deaf individual is raising a gun at the officer, then, 

14

yes, the ADA 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that's not what you 

16

answered to me.  You said if the individual is armed and 

17

dangerous  actually it should be armed and violent, 

18

that  now you are saying that is not enough. 

19

 This individual was armed and violent, and 

20

you say it's not enough.  It depends on the 

21

circumstances.  Now, which do you want us to hold? 

22

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Dangerous, Justice Scalia. 

23

Dangerous.  If the individual presents a significant 

24

threat, then no accommodation is required. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All right.

14

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3
4

Any accommodation 
And there is a circuit 

conflict on that point; isn't there? 
 MS. VAN AKEN: 

I believe there is, Justice 

5

Scalia, because the Fifth Circuit in Hainze said that 

6

anytime there is exigent circumstances, you just don't 

7

look to the ADA.  And what the Ninth Circuit has really 

8

done here, in our view, has given almost no weight to 

9

the exigency of the circumstances. 

10

 And I think there's two ways the Court can 

11

resolve this case.  One is to hold the direct threat 

12

regulation applies to situations like this one because 

13

the significant risk had not been eliminated here, and 

14

therefore 

15
16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Where was that in your 

brief? 

17

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  Which brief? 
Where was  the brief 

19

below it, to the circuit court.  Where did you use the 

20

words direct threat and parrot the statute? 

21

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes 
Because you're  you're 

23

not parroting the statute.  The statute says, in 

24

determining whether an individual possesses a direct 

25

threat, a public entity must make an individualized

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

assessment based on reasonable judgment that relies on 

2

current medical damage or on the best available 

3

objective evidence to ascertain the nature, duration, 

4

and severity of the risk, the probability that the 

5

potential injury will occur, and whether reasonable 

6

modifications will mitigate the risk. 

7
8
9
10

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

That is from the regulation, 

Justice Sotomayor.  We did not 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
 MS. VAN AKEN: 

That is the regulation. 
 cite the regulation to 

11

the  to the Ninth Circuit.  What we cited was Hainze, 

12

and Hainze's analysis that in exigent circumstances you 

13

don't provide an accommodation.  Now, we certainly think 

14

that at least where the exigent circumstances rise to 

15

the level that they did here, you don't provide an 

16

accommodation.  And the reason for that is that the 

17

fundamental government activity here is protecting 

18

public safety. 

19

 And so in that situation  in a situation 

20

like this one, time is of the essence, and so to 

21

delay  to delay an arrest as an accommodation where 

22

time is of the essence isn't a reasonable accommodation 

23

as a matter of law.  And my argument to this Court is 

24

that because officers are making risk judgments 

25

what  I  I  let's assume certain facts.

 MS. VAN AKEN:

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

All right?  Contrary to 

what you're  I will wait for your reply. 

5

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7

Okay. 

I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor. 
May I finish the 

question? 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

10

Yes. 
There is no exit 

possible, and the police officers knew that. 

11

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry? 
The police officers knew 

13

that there was no way to escape from that apartment. 

14

They knew that the building was empty.  Could you still 

15

defend their decision to go in given that they could 

16

have waited and tried to talk her out? 

17

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

So if the building  if they 

18

knew the building was empty, unlike here, and if they 

19

knew there was no exit, unlike here, we still think 

20

there would be a question about whether she had other 

21

weapons in the room and could be preparing some kind of 

22

ambush or some kind of barricade, and that's something 

23

that the officers here testified they were concerned 

24

about it, page 198 and one 199 of the Joint Appendix. 

25

So what they thought was necessary was to get that door

17

Alderson Reporting Company

open so that they could see what Ms. Sheehan was doing, 

2

so they could see if she were preparing an ambush or 

3

barricade.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's different than 

what they did however. 

6

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well
They opened the door, 

8

and they rushed in and pepper sprayed her.  They  they

weren't just opening the door to see if she had a gun or 

10

other instruments of danger. 

11

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Justice Sotomayor 
So let's  let's assume 

13

my hypothetical.  Doesn't  doesn't this require them, 

14

if it doesn't change the nature of their service, 

15

protecting the public, to wait for their backup and to 

16

wait for the crisis intervention team? 

17

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

If they knew there was no 

18

danger from not opening the door, then, yes, that could 

19

be a reasonable accommodation.  They didn't know that 

20

here. 

21
22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
fact? 

23

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

So why isn't that a jury 

I'm sorry 
Why isn't that a jury 

fact?

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

It's not a jury fact because 

2

no reasonable jury could conclude that there was no 

3

significant danger here.  I  the  what the officers 

4

were doing was preventing a danger that they had a 

5

reasonable basis to believe existed.  They were doing 

6

that by opening a door.  With respect, they didn't rush 

7

in.  It was Ms. Sheehan who rushed out and crossed the 

8

threshold.  What they did is open the door prepared with 

9

pepper spray to use it, and then prepared to use their 

10

firearms that they needed to, and that's unfortunately 

11

what they needed to do. 

12
13

 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time 
for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN 

Thank you, counsel. 

17

 ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

18

 SUPPORTING VACATUR IN PART AND REVERSAL IN PART 

19
20
21

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 
 The ADA provides individuals with 

22

disabilities with important rights in their interactions 

23

with the police, including arrest.  However, under the 

24

circumstances here, the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong 

25

standard when it sent to the jury both the ADA claim and

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Fourth Amendment claim, because it gave insufficient 

2

weight to the safety risks the officers faced when they 

3

confronted an individual who was mentally ill and armed 

4

and violent. 

5

 I would like to have touch base first on the 

6

two preliminary  two of the preliminary questions that 

7

the Court has identified.  First, it is clear that the 

8

ADA applies to arrests.  The ADA applies broadly to any 

9

department or agency of the local Government, that 

10

includes the police, and it applies broadly to 

11

activities, services, and programs which also includes 

12

arrests. 

13
14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

There is no circuit 

conflict on that point? 

15

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

There is no circuit 

16

conflict since Yeskey that it applies to arrests, Your 

17

Honor, so that is correct.  And we think that that makes 

18



19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course, at the common 

20

law, it was  it was clear that statutes normally did 

21

not apply to the police, for instance, even though the 

22

speeding law does not have an exemption for police 

23

vehicles, a policeman could speed.  It was just assumed 

24

that normal criminal offenses did not apply to a 

25

policeman acting within the scope of his duties.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

But, Your Honor, the ADA, 

2

of course, is not a criminal statute, and it was an 

3

intent by Congress to apply quite broadly, as this Court 

4

recognized in Yeskey, it applies to State prisons.  The 

5

text of the statute doesn't have any exemption at all 

6

for police activities 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, I'm not talking about 

prisons.  I'm just talking about enforcing the law. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, but I do think 

10

that, again, the statute has no exceptions, and this 

11

Court  the lower courts are in agreement, and it's 

12

consistent with the Justice Department guidance, and 

13

there is a good reason for that.  It's along the lines 

14

of Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that things like 

15

providing an interpreter during the arrest of a deaf 

16

individual, as this Court, in the case that was before 

17

this Court about a decade ago in Gorman, providing 

18

transportation for a wheelchair bound individual to the 

19

police station, for conducting sobriety tests, have a 

20

walk the line test for someone with physical 

21

disabilities, those are the core kinds of things that 

22

the ADA is designed to get at. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And do you also agree 

24

with Ms. Van Aken that there is vicarious liability, 

25

because the ADA operates against entities, not

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

individuals, not officers.  So do you also accept that 

2

there is vicarious liability, rather than the 

3

enterprise, the entity would be liable if it had a 

4

pattern or practice. 

5

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

We do believe that, 

6

Justice Ginsburg, that there is the effect  the 

7

effectively respondeat superior liability much of the 

8

time will only be for injunctive relief, precisely 

9

because in the absence of an intentional harm, damages 

10

would not be available.  But, yes, we do believe that 

11

there is the equivalent of respondeat superior 

12

liability.  Of course, none of that has been briefed in 

13

this case, but if I could just touch on one more issue 

14

that hasn't been briefed in this case that the Court 

15

should not resolve is Justice Alito's question about 

16

reasonable accommodation. 

17

 This Court said in Tennessee v. Lane, both 

18

in Justice Stevens' majority opinion, and in Chief 

19

Rehnquist's dissent that reasonable accommodation was 

20

required by Title II of the ADA.  That makes sense. 

21

Titles I, II, III, and the Rehab Act all require 

22

reasonable accommodation.  Titles I and III do so 

23

expressly in 21.112 and Section 21.182.  And Title II 

24

does it by reference.  What Title II is it broadly 

25

defines discrimination.  And then in Section 12.201, the

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress provided that the regulations and provisions 

2

the protections in Title II shall be the same or no less 

3

than the protections in the Rehab Act, including the 

4

regulations in the Rehab Act.  So I think it's clear 

5

that reasonable accommodation occurs  is required by 

6

Title 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It does seem to me that the 

8

dynamics are different in the arrest context.  Now, 

9

here, I guess the officers had reason to know that this 

10

individual had a disability, but what happens if police 

11

officers have to arrest somebody out on the street that 

12

seems to be behaving in an unusual fashion.  How can 

13

they determine whether that person has a disability, it 

14

may be someone who is schizophrenic and isn't taking his 

15

or her medications, or it might be somebody who does not 

16

have a mental illness, but has taken some kind of 

17

controlled substance, how do they make those 

18

determinations on the spot when they're arresting 

19

someone. 

20

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, the ADA applies when 

21

you know or believe that the person has a disability, 

22

including mental illness.  So in some of the 

23

hypotheticals that Your Honor just poses, the ADA would 

24

not apply.  But, of course, in this case, they did, as 

25

Your Honor says, they did know.  And in fact, the whole

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purpose of the entry was to address a problem of mental 

2

illness. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But in the case I posited, 

4

there would be an issue about whether the officers 

5

should have known that this person was behaving 

6

bizarrely, had a mental illness? 

7

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

We don't believe that 

8

should have known is the standard in the ADA.  So it's 

9

not a should have known standard with respect to the 

10
11

disability. 
 With respect to how the Court should 

12

approach this, and the question that we understand to 

13

presented and whether it should adopt the Hainze 

14

approach.  We have proposed for the Court that it apply 

15

the Barnett standard.  The root of that standard is the 

16

recognition that in the mine run of cases like this, 

17

with an armed and violent individual, it would be a 

18

great danger to the officers or to the public, and short 

19

time.  And so consistent with the Justice Department 

20

guidelines, which say the officers' priority is to 

21

stabilize the situation, and I think with the instincts 

22

of the courts of appeals, we think the right way to 

23

operationalize that instinct and map it onto this 

24

Court's precedent is through a Barnett standard, which 

25

is to recognize that it will very rarely be the case

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that an accommodation is needed. 
 So when might one be needed under Barnett? 

3

Well, it goes, I think, to Justice Sotomayor's hypo with 

4

one tweak.  It's our view that the rare occasions when 

5

an accommodation would be needed involves something like 

6

when it's contained and visible.  So a threat that you 

7

knew there was no opportunity for escape and you could 

8

see the individual, perhaps if there was a security 

9

camera in Ms. Sheehan's room, or another example, if you 

10

had a mentally ill individual with a knife cornered in 

11

an alley, so there was possibility of escape and the 

12

officers could retreat.  We think those might be the 

13

rare situations that a reasonable accommodation would be 

14

needed.  The reason for that is a reasonable 

15

accommodation is not  a reasonable modification is not 

16

needed, in our view, when it presents significant safety 

17

risks to the officer or the public. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about saying it is 

19

never reasonable to accommodate somebody who is armed 

20

and violent? 

21

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Your Honor, that is 
That seems to me a fairly 

23

sensible statement.  It is never reasonable to 

24

accommodate somebody who is armed and violent, period. 

25

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Which is what some courts 

have held. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

The Fifth Circuit, I 

4

believe, is the only court to have held that.  We don't 

5

think that that's the right standard, although we think 

6

their instinct there is a lot closer than what the Ninth 

7

Circuit has done.  We don't think it's right for two 

8

one legal reason and one sort of practical reason.  The 

9

legal reason is this Court has avoided generally in the 

10

context of reasonableness the sort of bright line rules 

11

that the Fifth Circuit has articulated.  So that is the 

12

first reason.  With respect to the practical 

13

consequences, I think it does get to my response to 

14

Justice 

15
16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

accept that.  That's not a bright line rule. 

17

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

18

doesn't apply at all 

19

Excuse me, but I don't 

I think if you say it 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It doesn't apply  it 

20

doesn't apply in one particular circumstance, where the 

21

person is armed and violent. 

22

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, we think that 

23

a  sort of one notch back from that is actually the 

24

right approach, that it captures the idea that Your 

25

Honor is articulating, and that drove the Fifth Circuit,

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but does it without the absolute rule, which is, I 

2

think, how many of the other circuits, other than the 

3

Ninth Circuit, are applying it.  They recognize that 

4

exigency is very, very important, but there will be 

5

times when the exigency is sort of in an unstable 

6

equilibrium, where the officers may have an obligation 

7

to back off. 

8
9
10
11
12
13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And you are asking for a 

remand  you say most of the time officers can go 
ahead.  But there may be some times when not. 
 What is there in the fact picture here that 
would warrant a remand?  Remand to determine what? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, we do 

14

think a remand is appropriate, but we will say we're not 

15

 we haven't seen anything in the record that would 

16

create that special circumstances.  But in fairness to 

17

plaintiffs, because it is a different standard than the 

18

one that they faced below, and they prevailed below, we 

19

think they should have a chance to go through the 

20

extensive record and make the arguments to the Ninth 

21

Circuit. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Gershengorn, if I can 

23

just get your understanding.  What are the special 

24

circumstances that we're reserving here?  What is the 

25

reason for not adopting Justice  the Fifth Circuit

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4
5
6

rule? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Because I think there will 

be times when the exigency is 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Tell me what those facts 

are. 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

When you  a paradigmatic 

7

case is when it is  it's visible  when the suspect 

8

is visible and contained.  So in other words, you can be 

9

assured that there is no additional risk from waiting, 

10

and that you can be assured that there is no danger to 

11

the public.  So for example, had there been a clear door 

12

into Ms. Sheehan's room so they could see what she was 

13

doing, if she was sort of huddled in the corner, that 

14

might be a situation in which a reasonable modification 

15

was appropriate, even though the situation was not 

16

overcontained in that sense, had she made a break for 

17

the window, had she made a move for another weapon, they 

18

could have done something about it. 

19
20
21

 THE COURT: 

Well, but I suppose suicide is 

always a concern in a case like that, right? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, there is a 

22

risk of danger to self, and the officers are allowed to 

23

take that into account.  We think that in a situation in 

24

which you can see her, that that would be a situation in 

25

which there were an agreement for a reasonable

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

modification, but we recognize that harm to self is 

2

something that the officers can take into 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I think the standard you 

4

just proposed gives no guidance at all to an officer 

5

faced with a violent  with a violent person. 

6

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, may I answer? 
Sure. 
Your Honor, I do think it 

9

gives guidance in this sense.  It says that absent a 

10

situation in which you have  in which you can have 

11

some confidence that there is no risk to the public, you 

12

don't have to worry about a reasonable modification.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD FELDMAN 
 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

20

 The principal dispute in this case is a 

21

factual one, not a legal dispute.  It's a factual 

22

dispute. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Exactly.  I don't know why 

we took the case. 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

And I agree entirely with that

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

comment, Justice Scalia.  And that's why, in our brief, 

2

we commented that perhaps this is an appropriate 

3

instance where the Court would dismiss as improvidently 

4

granted. 

5

 The Hainze discussion is very different than 

6

what's being proposed here.  Hainze got it wrong.  What 

7

Hainze said was that any time there's a  a 

8

confrontation that's out in the open, we just won't 

9

apply the ADA.  But one of the powers of the ADA, one of 

10

the strengths is the regulatory framework is so 

11

comprehensive.  And so we have the direct threat 

12

exception, the direct threat defense, Section 139 of the 

13

ADA regs.  And it addresses all of the issues that are 

14

before this Court. 

15

 The first and the primary consideration is, 

16

was there or wasn't there a substantial risk to the 

17

public.  And critically, it doesn't talk about risks to 

18

the individual.  That's not within the ADA regulations. 

19

We're just talking about, is there a risk to the public. 

20

And that's the disputed issue in this case.  That's the 

21

issue that the Ninth Circuit set down. 

22

 But there's another part to Section 139, and 

23

that's whether this  that if there is a significant 

24

risk, if you can mitigate that risk with reasonable 

25

accommodations.  And that's what Lou Reiter talks about

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in his report, is the various ways that we mitigate a 

2

risk when we're dealing with someone who is mentally 

3

disabled. 

4

 But let's go back to the risks, because, 

5

Justice Sotomayor, I think you hit the nail on the head. 

6

There was no public risk here.  And the reason for that 

7

is because she was in her room, and she had made clear 

8

she wanted to be left alone.  She didn't chase after 

9

these officers.  She closed the door.  The officers had 

10

climbed up two flights of stairs to get to her front 

11

door. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, the actual dispute 

13

was that Hodge, the social worker, claims he told them 

14

that this was a secondfloor apartment, and there was no 

15

way to leave, and that the building had been evacuated. 

16

 MR. FELDMAN: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18
19

Exactly. 
So there's a factual 

dispute between what they say and the witness says. 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

Right.  And the only time that 

20

we get beyond the  the record, I guess  one of the 

21

arguments that you heard from Ms. Van Aken about, well, 

22

she might have had a gun, she might have had a 

23

hostage 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
wanted to commit suicide 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

She might have 

Official

1

 MR. FELDMAN: 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
 which is a 

3

reason  I mean, the officers did not go in there to 

4

shoot her.  They used the pepper spray first.  Why isn't 

5

that a sufficient justification? 

6

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Two reasons, Your Honor. 

7

First of all, the  the  the reply brief makes very 

8

clear that when they went in the second time, it wasn't 

9

to help her.  It was to apprehend her.  And the second 

10
11

is that 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I'm not sure I 

12

understand that distinction.  If you think she's going 

13

to harm herself, apprehending her prevents that. 

14
15
16

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Shooting and killing her is 

not an efficacious way to prevent 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I  I understand 

17

the point.  And it's  it's a clever point to make, 

18

except, as I said earlier, they used pepper spray the 

19

first time.  And it was only when the pepper spray was 

20

ineffective that they had a necessity of taking armed 

21

action. 

22

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Right.  To get back to your 

23

questions, the regulations that have been adopted in 

24

ADA, the Department of Justice made a determination that 

25

danger to self was not a consideration under the 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under the direct threat defense to the ADA.  That was a 

2

decision that the Department of Justice made.  So that 

3

determination is not relevant here, but that, too, was 

4

hotly disputed. 

5

 Remember that Hodge, when he filled out the 

6

form, he checked "greatly disabled."  He checked "danger 

7

to others."  He did not check "danger to self."  And 

8

what he testified to was that he did not give these 

9

officers any reason to believe that she was a danger to 

10

herself.  Greatly disabled 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I 

12

understand  I understand the factual dispute in this 

13

case.  But is your position that based on the Justice 

14

regulations, that danger to self is never a 

15

justification for approaching and trying to apprehend 

16

and subdue somebody in this situation? 

17

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Under the ADA, that's clear. 

18

And the reason for that is the ADA contemplates 

19

providing reasonable accommodations as a way of avoiding 

20

discrimination.  It would be inconsistent with the ADA 

21

if officers were to, as in this case, pepper spray, take 

22

people into custody as a way of preventing them from 

23

doing harm to themselves. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I don't know why you 

wouldn't think the pepper spray, instead of the weapons,

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in the first instance wasn't a reasonable accommodation. 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

If they had gone in with 

3

pepper spray, it might be a very different case.  But 

4

they went in with pepper spray with their guns 

5

unholstered. 

6
7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Just  just to make 

clear 

8

 MR. FELDMAN: 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And 
 you say danger to 

10

to ­ to the self is  is not a reason for apprehending 

11

the person? 

12

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Not under the  it's not a 

13

reason  let me be clear.  It is not a reason for 

14

failing to accommodate under the ADA. 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

 MR. FELDMAN: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18
19

Or at least trying to. 
Correct. 
She had called for 

backup, and she had called for the CIT, correct? 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

Right.  Right.  Danger to self 

20

may present issues under the Fourth Amendment, but 

21

that's not our case. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why should that be?  I  I 

23

can't imagine why that should be.  I mean, if you have a 

24

person that you know is mentally unstable and they're 

25

they're about to kill themselves, you  you  you have

34

to back off and say, well, you know, this is not  not 

2

something that requires accommodation.

 MR. FELDMAN: 

I  I  I can't tell you,

only tell you that that's the law under the ADA.  And

everybody  all the parties here have relied on

Section 139, because it's what governs this issue.  And 

12

it doesn't ask the police officers whether or not 

13

somebody is a harm to their self. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But this case is about 

15

danger to the police  police officers.  This is 

16

this is a case where a social worker says, she 

17

threatened to kill me. 

18

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Yeah.  And I think that's a 

19

very good point.  I  I don't think this Court has to 

20

reach out and address what might or might not be the law 

21

in a situation involving someone who might be a threat 

22

or a harm to themselves. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr.  Mr. Feldman, do you 

24

agree with the Solicitor General's standard here, and 

25

you just disagree on the facts, or do you disagree with

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the Solicitor General's standard? 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

No.  We disagree very 

3

strenuously with any notion that a special circumstances 

4

test should apply here. 

5

 Looking at the U.S. Airways case, the Court 

6

adopted that test for very good reasons.  And it was 

7

because, in that case, there was a direct conflict 

8

between the proposed accommodation and the employer's 

9

seniority rules.  So in that circumstance, the Court 

10
11

added a burden to the plaintiff. 
 That isn't our case. 

In our case, we have 

12

symmetry between the proposed accommodation, on the one 

13

hand, and the way that San Francisco trains its officers 

14

and also universally accepted methods for dealing with 

15

mentally disabled individuals.  So we're not in a 

16

situation where we need to adopt a special circumstances 

17

test.  And as was noted earlier, I don't know what it 

18

means, and I don't know how a police officer can 

19

possibly figure that out. 

20

 What I said earlier about the direct threat 

21

exception, and how powerful it is and how useful it is, 

22

that's what's in the regulation.  And that's language 

23

that police officers understand because they are doing 

24

that already in the Fourth Amendment.  Is there a direct 

25

threat here?  Can it be mitigated through reasonable

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

accommodations?  Police officers aren't trained, and I 

2

don't know that they ever would be, to figure out what a 

3

special circumstance is. 

4

 So we have a regulation. 

It's been adopted 

5

through notice and comment rulemaking.  It's expressed 

6

in language that police officers can understand.  It's 

7

been applied by the lower courts.  This just isn't a 

8

case in which we should be adopting a special 

9

circumstances test, particularly since it wasn't 

10

addressed below.  The Ninth Circuit didn't address any 

11

special circumstance test.  And from what I know, no 

12

court in this country has ever decided whether to adopt 

13

that special circumstance test.  So I think that 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, what did  I 

15

thought that the government said if somebody is armed 

16

and dangerous, the presumption is no modifications are 

17

required. 

18
19

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Under Hainze, if a person is 

armed and dangerous, then the ADA doesn't apply. 

20

 That's a different issue that, as Justice 

21

Scalia has mentioned, hasn't been raised here.  The 

22

argument that the Government is making, as I understand 

23

it, is that if somebody is armed and dangerous, then 

24

there is a presumption that the direct threat exception 

25

is satisfied.  And that's the only way to see that

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argument and  and have it make sense in the 

2

regulatory 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I have a hard time 

4

actually understanding if there's much of a difference 

5

between the reg and the Government's special 

6

circumstance, because the ADA, as a matter of course, 

7

doesn't say you have to change your procedures unless a 

8

reasonable accommodation can reduce the risk or can 

9

eliminate the risk.  So what's the difference between 

10
11

that and special circumstance? 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

The  the Government is 

12

putting their thumb on the scale.  That's the 

13

difference. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There I  I agree with 

15

you.  Any time we start creating tests, I think it 

16

complicates things when you just go by the language. 

17

The issue always for the jury is, could they have 

18

eliminated this risk. 

19

 MR. FELDMAN: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21
22

And I agree with that. 
That is what the 

statute  that's what the reg says. 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

Right, right.  But it should 

23

not be necessary for a plaintiff in an ADA case to also 

24

have to show that there were special circumstances.  All 

25

the plaintiff needs to show is what the reasonable

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

accommodations would be to prevent discrimination, and 

2

the  the burden then shifts to the defendant to make 

3

the showing of direct threat, if that's the defense that 

4

the defendant wants to assert.  And throwing the special 

5

circumstances test in the middle of that, it  it 

6

violates and  and undermines the regulatory framework. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but I think the idea 

8

of the government's test, Mr. Feldman, is this is an 

9

extraordinary circumstance in which the government is 

10

facing somebody who has a weapon, somebody who may be 

11

violent at any time, and that we shouldn't turn every 

12

case into an inquiry about, was this the absolute best 

13

thing that the police could have done.  You know, 

14

there's  there's a lot of uncertainty in these 

15

situations, and some reason to give the police officers 

16

who have to deal with them the benefit of the doubt. 

17

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Well, if  if you see it that 

18

way, Your Honor, then I think we're back to where we 

19

started, and the point that Justice Sotomayor was 

20

making, there wasn't a threat here.  So if we're going 

21

to have a special circumstances test 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Okay.  But then that's, 

23

again, just the question of does this meet the special 

24

circumstances or does it not meet the special 

25

circumstances?  I guess what I was trying to sort of

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

figure out was the reason why you object to the 

2

government's test in the first instance. 

3

 MR. FELDMAN: 

I think the best way to put it 

4

is that they put their thumb on the scale, and it's a 

5

scale that has been carefully balanced in the 

6

regulations and the statute, and there isn't any reason 

7

for this Court to start changing what the regulatory 

8

framework is.  It's not an issue that the lower courts 

9

have had an opportunity to develop.  I don't know what 

10

circumstances it might or might apply in.  It may be 

11

very well an issue that the Petitioners here can raise 

12

in the district court on summary judgment, and an issue 

13

that this Court can decide at a later date.  But the 

14

issue before the Court today is really just this fact 

15

issue that I started with, which is, was there a direct 

16

threat here.  And all of the 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So what  if you 

18

were giving the twosentence guidance in the  in the 

19

education course to the police about what to do in a 

20

situation where they confront somebody who is mentally 

21

unstable, what would you tell them to do? 

22

 MR. FELDMAN: 

If the direct threat defense 

23

is not satisfied, then you must accommodate that 

24

individual's disability. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that doesn't

Official

1

give  I mean, that throws a lot of legal terms at 

2

them.  I mean, in terms of their actual ontheground 

3

guidance, can you do better than saying you must 

4

accommodate the disability? 

5

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Well, they're trained in 

6

accommodation techniques, so I don't think that's really 

7

the issue.  There's no dispute that the way to interact 

8

with mentally disabled individuals is through 

9

communication and time.  Police officers know that, and 

10

they're trained that way.  I think the difficulty that 

11

the Solicitor General and the Petitioners are 

12

identifying is that these are difficult circumstances 

13

and potentially dangerous. 

14

 But that's what the direct threat defense 

15

governs.  And to put English onto the direct threat 

16

defense, the police officers have to be asking 

17

themselves, as I think they already do under Graham v. 

18

Connor, is there an immediate threat to the public, and 

19

is that a threat that we can eliminate somehow? 

20

 And if it can be eliminated by, for example, 

21

here leaving the door closed, bringing in a negotiator, 

22

giving Sheehan time to deescalate, that entire risk that 

23

the officers here confronted was avoidable.  And one of 

24

the things that Section 139 asks is what is the 

25

likelihood of  of  of the threat, and  and what is

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the extent of the threat?  Because whatever the risks of 

2

deescalation here, the course that these officers picked 

3

led to the certainty of a violent confrontation with a 

4

mentally ill and agitated woman who is standing behind 

5

this door with a knife.  And they knew that when they 

6

went in with their pepper spray. 

7

 It was reasonably foreseeable that when they 

8

went in with their pepper spray, and they sprayed 

9

Ms. Sheehan, because she was going to still be there 

10

with a knife, the stage had been set, it was reasonably 

11

foreseeable that they would need to shoot her. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Gee, I  I would  I 

13

would have thought it was foreseeable that the pepper 

14

spray would disable her. 

15

 MR. FELDMAN: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17
18
19
20
21
22

If she wasn't 
Isn't that what pepper 

spray is supposed to do. 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

It is.  And  and the 

Ninth 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Was this defective pepper 

spray?  What was  what was the matter here? 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

The Ninth Circuit has been 

23

quite good about explaining that nonlethal force does 

24

not work in the intended way when we're dealing with 

25

mentally disabled individuals.

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 If I get shot with pepper spray, I'm on the 

2

ground dropping whatever knives I have, but when 

3

mentally ill individuals get shot with pepper spray, 

4

they don't always process it the same way.  Sometimes 

5

they see that as a threat, and sometimes they act 

6

irrationally. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What would you say to 

8

officers who encounter a person on the street about 

9

determining whether the person has a disability? 

10

 MR. FELDMAN: 

I think that's a difficult 

11

issue that isn't presented here, but police officers are 

12

trained to recognize disabilities.  And the  the 

13

learning materials that Lou Reiter discusses in his 

14

report include how to identify somebody who is of 

15

diminished capacity or mentally disabled.  Again, that's 

16

not our case.  These officers knew that she was disabled 

17

because they weren't called to the scene to arrest her, 

18

they were called to the scene 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I understand it's not this 

20

case, but our decision would have implications in other 

21

contexts.  So you would tell the officers, well, you 

22

have to determine whether this person is substantially 

23

limited in a major life activity, and if so, that person 

24

has a disability, what would you do? 

25

 MR. FELDMAN: 

I would say that if you know,

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or can reasonably determine that an individual is 

2

suffering from a mental disability, then the ADA 

3

reasonable accommodation requirements apply. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

drugs a mental disability? 

6
7
8
9
10
11

 MR. FELDMAN: 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

He's high on drugs because 

he took drugs. 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

Well, if it was a choice to 

take drugs 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Yes. 
 and it was unrelated to a 

mental disability 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. FELDMAN: 

17

I think it would depend on why 

somebody is high on drugs.  They  they may 

12

14

Is  is being high on 

Right. 
 then  then I think it 

would not be a mental disability. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Why? 
Mr. Gershengorn said that 

20

the ADA was only triggered when the officer knew there 

21

was a disability.  Do you disagree with that from your 

22

answer to Justice Alito? 

23
24
25

 MR. FELDMAN: 

I  I agree with Ms. Van Aken 

that it's either knew or should have known. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

And presumably,

Official

1

there's no way to tell if there's somebody you come upon 

2

on the street who's exhibiting signs of being on  on 

3

drugs, whether that is because of prescription 

4

medication or illicit drugs. 

5

 MR. FELDMAN: 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

7

I  I think that's right. 
And  but they 

but they have to be treated differently. 

8

 MR. FELDMAN: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

10

 MR. FELDMAN: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

They do. 
I'm sorry.  Why? 
Well, because 
If the  if the danger 

12

is present, right?  All right?  Why do they have to be 

13

treated differently?  One  one would assume that if 

14

someone's dangerous and violent, and there's no way to 

15

modify dealing with them, does it matter whether they're 

16

disabled or not or what the cause is or not?  The issue 

17

is, don't resort to violence automatically if there's a 

18

way to mitigate the risk.  Isn't that the answer? 

19

 Now, whether you'll be liable for potential 

20

damages or an injunction or anything else, that depends 

21

on whether you knew the person was disabled.  That's a 

22

different issue altogether. 

23

 MR. FELDMAN: 

I agree with  with what you 

24

said.  The difference is whether there's liability under 

25

the ADA.  That turns on whether the officer knew or

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

should have known that the individual was disabled.  The 

2

Fourth Amendment issues, you're absolutely right.  When 

3

an officer confronts somebody who is of diminished 

4

capacity for whatever reason, the officer has to use 

5

reasonable force.  And  and in a totality of the 

6

circumstances test, the diminished capacity is one of 

7

those circumstances.  And it's not just for the 

8

protection 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

10

 MR. FELDMAN: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If you know about it. 
Right. 
But if you don't, and 

12

whatever the cause is, if the person's violent and 

13

there's no way to mitigate the risk, it doesn't matter 

14

whether they're disabled or not. 

15

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Correct, because of Section 

16

139.  And again, that's the strength of Section 139 is 

17

it tells the police officers exactly what they need to 

18

know. 

19

 So we have a very robust regulatory 

20

framework and it comes back down to this very simple 

21

issue of whether there was a risk.  And things like 

22

guns, there is no evidence of any guns; things like 

23

hostages, there was no evidence of any hostages.  The 

24

officers were able to look into her apartment.  They 

25

didn't see hostages.  Hodge was in her apartment, he

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

didn't see a hostage.  He told them that the apartment 

2

building was empty.  In terms of a risk of flight, they 

3

knew that they were on the second floor.  Hodge had said 

4

to them that they needed a ladder to get in. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Hodge also said there was 

6

probably a fire escape.  He was wrong about that, but he 

7

did say that. 

8
9

 MR. FELDMAN: 

He didn't say that to them at 

the time, he said that in his deposition, and what he 

10

said was he doesn't know whether there is or isn't a 

11

fire escape.  So all these officers knew at the time is 

12

that they were in a second floor building, with a second 

13

floor and Hodge had said to them very specifically, you 

14

need a ladder to get in.  That was the evidence.  That's 

15

the best available objective evidence that was available 

16

to these officers.  And under this Court's Fourth 

17

Amendment jurisprudence, that's what we look at, 

18

objective evidence.  Under the ADA, again, Section 139 

19

uses that phrase, "best available objective evidence." 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And  and, Mr. Feldman, I 

21

guess I'm still trying to figure out exactly who's 

22

advocating for what legal standard and how those 

23

standards are connected with each other.  But if  if 

24

you are using this direct threat regulation, do you 

25

understand you and the City to be advocating for the

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

same legal standard? 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

I think so.  I think what 

3

differentiates the City on the one hand and us on the 

4

other is not what testifies, but whether it's satisfied 

5

here. 

6
7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

to the regulation as the test. 

8

 MR. FELDMAN: 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

10
11

Because you're both looking 

Right. 
And the City says it's 

satisfied; you say it's not. 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

Right.  And  and the 

12

interesting thing is they're supporting the amici cite 

13

the same regulation.  Our supporting amici cite the same 

14

regulation.  That is the regulation that governs whether 

15

there is or isn't a defense to a failure to accommodate. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So the only party who is not 

17

saying that that's the standard is the Solicitor 

18

General, whose stand  whose regulation it is. 

19

 MR. FELDMAN: 

20

right.  That's right. 

21

 (Laughter.) 

22

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Well, the Solicitor  that's 

But  but the Solicitor 

23

General does have a footnote in their brief that says 

24

that even after the  the special circumstances 

25

analysis is conducted, the direct threat analysis might

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

also be applicable.  And I don't quite understand how 

2

that is the case, but as I said, I don't think this is 

3

the right case for this Court to  to be thinking about 

4

whether a special circumstances test make sense.  It 

5

just hasn't had an opportunity to be vetted below.  But 

6

what we're left with is pretty wide agreement that the 

7

direct threat defense governs these issues. 

8

 And so if the Court doesn't have any more 

9

questions about that, I'll briefly address qualified 

10
11

immunity. 
 The issue on qualified immunity is  is 

12

also a narrow one.  It's not whether there is a Fourth 

13

Amendment violation, but whether the actions here 

14

violated clearly established law.  And in the Ninth 

15

Circuit, we have two cases that involve substantially 

16

similar facts, and they're both cited by the Ninth 

17

Circuit in its decision below.  One was Alexander and 

18

the other was Diorro. 

19

 Alexander is a particularly interesting case 

20

because the defendant there was the City and County of 

21

San Francisco.  So if they were aware of any case, you 

22

would think that would be one of them.  The plaintiff in 

23

Alexander was mentally ill.  The officers arrived at his 

24

house to execute an administrative warrant, and rather 

25

than allow them to do it, the plaintiff there threatened

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to shoot anyone who entered his house.  And it's the 

2

exact same circumstances we have here.  The situation 

3

was contained, there was no need to immediately enter 

4

and the officers made the decision to go in in 

5

circumstances that led to a violent outcome.  And the 

6

Ninth Circuit held that the officers there were not 

7

entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law 

8

because the extent of the threat was unknown and 

9

disputed.  So it  it raised a jury question. 

10

 Diorro is the other case that the Ninth 

11

Circuit cited.  Diorro stands for the proposition that 

12

where an officer knows that an individual's mentally 

13

disabled, that's something that has to be considered in 

14

determining what force is appropriate under the Fourth 

15

Amendment.  And we have very clear testimony from the 

16

officers here that at least when Reynolds made the 

17

decision to force their way back into Sheehan's 

18

apartment, they didn't consider Sheehan's disability. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought in Diorro, the 

20

plaintiff was unarmed, had not attacked or touched 

21

anyone, had generally obeyed instructions. 

22

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Well, what the Court said is 

23

that he was unarmed in the sense that he didn't have a 

24

knife or a gun.  What he had, though, was lighters 

25

fluid.  And so he had a dangerous instrumentality and 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and the issue is the same, the police officers forced a 

2

violent confrontation when there wasn't a need to do so. 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It's very hard when 

4

you have such a factintensive inquiry, and I think that 

5

was part of your submission, to say that the law was 

6

clearly established as to how they should function in a 

7

particular circumstance, which I think is important when 

8

you're talking about making the officers personally 

9

liable. 

10

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Yeah.  Although this Court has 

11

looked at whether the facts of a previous case are 

12

substantially similar or sometimes it's  it's 

13

described as being fundamentally similar.  The facts 

14

don't have to be the same.  Substantial similarity 

15

doesn't require exact similarity.  But the facts of 

16

Alexander, in particular, are very, very close to the 

17

facts in our case.  So whether it's fact specific or 

18

not, we  we've got 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Only facts in the same 

20

jurisdiction  of cases in the same jurisdiction are 

21

relevant? 

22
23
24
25

 MR. FELDMAN: 

I think that's a bigger 

issue than what we 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.  Well, I mean, suppose 

this officer knows that in  in some jurisdictions or

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

at least in the Fifth Circuit, boy, you know, if this 

2

person's armed and violent, I don't have to accommodate 

3

at all.  So, you know, you could say that the point 

4

was  was not clear.  I mean, how can you say that 

5

that it was clear under  at least under Supreme Court 

6

law? 

7

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Well, the Supreme Court's 

8

decision in Wilson v. Lane and Hope v. Pelzer, both look 

9

at whether there's precedent in the controlling circuit. 

10

These are officers who are in San Francisco within the 

11

jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, and unless and until 

12

this Court takes a case and reverses something that the 

13

Ninth Circuit has said, I think that they're duty bound 

14

to comply with Ninth Circuit precedent. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

On the qualified immunity 

16

issue, could we consider the question whether there was 

17

a Fourth Amendment violation at all?  Assuming the 

18

City  assuming that counsel for the officers raised 

19

that argument? 

20

 MR. FELDMAN: 

Well, yes, absolutely.  They 

21

did not raise it in their Petitioner's brief or the 

22

reply brief.  They focused instead on the second prong 

23

of the qualified immunity analysis, but certainly, this 

24

Court has the discretion to reach the Fourth Amendment 

25

principles instead.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, do you think they 

waived that argument? 
 MR. FELDMAN: 

I think there's an argument 

4

that they did, but again, it's  it's an issue that I 

5

think the Court has discretion to do what's appropriate. 

6

But I think it would be unusual for the Court to 

7

address  and I think the Solicitor General makes this 

8

point, too  to address an issue that hasn't been 

9

adequately briefed. 

10

 If I could just conclude. 

I think the Court 

11

knows that this is a case with enormous policy 

12

implications.  One of our amici, and we've got several, 

13

one of our amici counts among its members a family that 

14

called the police to get help with their mentally 

15

disabled son.  And the police showed up, and they, I'm 

16

sure, intended to help that individual, but instead, 

17

they hurt it.  And we see this in the news day after 

18

day, week after week, where the police arrive to help 

19

somebody and they wind up hurting them. 

20

 And, Your Honors, it's only when officers 

21

and public entities are held accountable for actions 

22

like those that occurred here that we can expect to see 

23

a change in that pattern.  So we ask that this Court 

24

affirm the Ninth Circuit.

 Ms. Van Aken, you have three minutes 
remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE VAN AKEN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MS. VAN AKEN: 

I'd like to make two points 

6

in my very brief time.  The first is that I think 

7

the Court took this case because there's a division in 

8

the circuits about the weight that they give to exigency 

9

and safety concerns in dangerous arrests like this one. 

10

I don't think there could be any question that in the 

11

Fifth Circuit, in the Fourth Circuit, where exigency has 

12

a lot of weight in the reasonableness analysis, that 

13

this case would have come out differently.  And I think 

14

that's the fundamental legal difference between the 

15

circuits and between the parties. 

16

 What I heard Mr. Feldman say  this is my 

17

second point, and it goes to the reasonableness of an 

18

accommodation.  I heard him say that it would only be 

19

reasonable to accommodate her if they could have 

20

eliminated the risk, but the risk was eliminated when 

21

the door was closed.  And with respect, I agree with the 

22

Solicitor General.  He's incorrect that the risk was 

23

eliminated, because  Mr. Feldman is incorrect that the 

24

risk is eliminated because Ms. Sheehan, whether or not 

25

she was fully contained, whether or not they had been

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

told by Mr. Hodge that there was no other exit, she 

2

certainly was not visible.  And behind her closed door, 

3

she could have been gathering her other knives, 

4

preparing an ambush, she had a cluttered room full of 

5

household items, maybe there was a cup of bleach she 

6

could throw in the face of the officers.  The point is 

7

that the officers knew that they meant  she meant them 

8

harm, they knew that she did not intend to go peacefully 

9

to the hospital, and they knew that at some point 

10

someone was going to have to go back in that room and 

11

deal with the situation.  And so delay behind a closed 

12

door could have been allowing her time to calm down, but 

13

the officers had no way to know that. 

14

 The final point I want to make is that 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Isn't that the point of 

16

the treatment, though, to try to give it a chance?  I 

17

mean, what your adversary has said is, we can't assume, 

18

unless we want a society in which the mentally ill are 

19

automatically killed, there's 350 people a year, 

20

estimated, who are shot by police officers and killed, 

21

who have mental illness.  And this is not to minimize, 

22

there's a hundred police officers who are killed, almost 

23

half of them from ambushes, and the other 50, I'm not 

24

sure what the circumstances were, but not ambush 

25

circumstances.  The point is, isn't the ADA  and the

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

House report makes this very clear  intended to ensure 

2

that police officers try mitigation in these situations 

3

before they jump to violence. 

4

 MS. VAN AKEN: 

Not where it increases safety 

5

risks to the officers.  The nature of the activity at 

6

the point where they were deciding whether to go in or 

7

not was to resolve a safety risk.  So any accommodation 

8

that increases a safety risk isn't reasonable as a 

9

matter of law.  Thank you.
