 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (10:06 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

first this morning in Case 14400, Charles Harris v. 

5

Mary Viegelahn for the Chapter 13 Trustee. 

6

 Mr. Madden. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW M. MADDEN 

8

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

9

 MR. MADDEN: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Bankruptcy cases can proceed under only one 

12

chapter of the Bankruptcy Code at a time.  There are 

13

three mains reasons why.  When Petitioner converted his 

14

case from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, Respondent was 

15

required to return postpetition wages she held as 

16

Chapter 13 Trustee. 

17

 First, the Code says 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Not just wages, right?  I 

19

mean, you constantly refer to it as postpetition wages. 

20

Anything that went into the pot that was still there. 

21

 MR. MADDEN: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23
24
25

That's right. 
I mean, it would be, you 

know, lease payments or anything else, right? 
 MR. MADDEN: 

Yes, Your Honor.  Any 

postpetition property, including wages.  Now, in the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

in the general category  Chapter 13 case, 

2

postpetition property held by the Chapter 13 trustee 

3

are wages, but because Section 348(f) of the Code speaks 

4

to what remains property of the estate in the converted 

5

case, that  that section requires that those wages or 

6

any other property remain property of the estate only if 

7

the  only if the case was converted in bad faith.  If 

8

the case is converted in good faith, as here, the 

9

petitioner gets to keep that property. 

10
11
12

 The second, the Code requires that when a 
case is converted from Chapter 13 to Chapter 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  It really 

13

doesn't say what happens to it, does it?  It just says 

14

what  what becomes the  the estate of the  of the 

15

Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 

16

 MR. MADDEN: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's right. 
It leaves up in the air 

18

what  what happens to the material that is not 

19

described in  in that provision, right? 

20

 MR. MADDEN: 

I think the statute doesn't 

21

explicitly say what happens to that  to that material, 

22

but what it does say is 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24
25

So why would it go back 

why would it go back to the debtor automatically? 
 MR. MADDEN: 

Because there's only one estate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

in a bankruptcy case that's created at the commencement 

2

of the case.  And so when Congress decided what will 

3

remain in that estate after conversion, and made that 

4

decision turn on whether the debtor has acted in good 

5

faith or bad faith, Congress has said what should happen 

6

in the case going forward.  So by creating a penalty for 

7

debtors who have converted their case in bad faith, 

8

Congress has said that debtors should  should retain 

9

the funds if they have converted the case in good faith. 

10

Moreover 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MR. MADDEN: 

What happens in bad faith? 
In bad faith, under Section 

13

348(f)(2) of the Code, if the debtor has converted his 

14

case to Chapter 7 in bad faith, all of the postpetition 

15

property remains property of the estate.  Effectively 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  but  and it seems 

17

to me that that is a statutory argument that cuts 

18

against your position, because the Code makes this 

19

makes this distinction. 

20

 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, no.  Respectfully, I 

21

disagree, Your Honor.  I think the Code cuts in our 

22

favor because  because of this distinction.  Congress 

23

has decided that it's only when  when a debtor 

24

converts its case in bad faith that this property should 

25

remain property of the estate available to creditors in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1
2

the case. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What does that mean? 

3

That  Chapter 13 is over, Chapter 7 is underway. 

4

Remains in a nonexistent estate  I mean, there's no 

5

more Chapter 13.  It goes to the creditors, right? 

6

 MR. MADDEN: 

Not quite, Your Honor.  It 

7

remains in the estate because a new Chapter 7 trustee 

8

takes over as the representative of the estate under the 

9

Code.  And so it becomes the Chapter 7 trustee's 

10

responsibility to administer that estate and make 

11

disbursements to creditors according to the Code. 

12

 Now, here 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Incidentally, I must say 

14

you are correct, I think this does cut in  in your 

15

favor, the idea that a  a badfaith conversion means 

16

that the estate is  is the current one, the current 

17

estate. 

18

 MR. MADDEN: 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

20
21
22
23

Okay. 
I think that Code 

distinction does cut in front of your favor. 
 MR. MADDEN: 

Right, and I think that's what 

Congress intended when they enacted Section 348 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What they said, 

24

specifically, is the property of the estate, and that's 

25

the property we're talking about, the property of the 13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

estate, right?  Because it's the property of the 13 

2

estate that goes into 7 at the moment the petition is 

3

filed to convert. 

4

 MR. MADDEN: 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

6

 MR. MADDEN: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right. 
Okay. 
Section 
Now, it says which property 

8

of the 13 estate that remains in the possession or is 

9

under the control of the debtor.  Is this money which is 

10

in the trustee in the possession of the debtor?  No.  Is 

11

it under the control of the  of the debtor?  Well, 

12

that depends on the answer to your question.  I mean, if 

13

you treat it like an escrow, as they want to, it isn't. 

14

If you treat it like a, say, a normal trustee, a normal 

15

trustee, I'll ask them this, it isn't.  And, therefore, 

16

it's outside the statute.  And there are no other words 

17

in this statute that really cut one way or the other. 

18

You can make an excellent argument either way as to any 

19

other word. 

20

 So there we are. 

21

don't know.  So 

22

 MR. MADDEN: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I read these and I said, I 

But 
So if you're going to point 

24

to  if you're going to point to the  to the words, 

25

unless I  I really read them several times in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

statute.  I couldn't say that you're favored or they're 

2

favored, because I don't know the answer to that word, 

3

control, and I couldn't find anything that really 

4

helped. 

5

 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, Section 348(f) intends 

6

essentially two elements to determine whether property 

7

is going to remain in the estate.  It has to both be 

8

in a goodfaith conversion, it has to be property that 

9

existed as of the date of the petition, and it still has 

10
11
12

to exist in the estate.  The debtor 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It doesn't say exist.  We 

got the words that it says. 

13

 MR. MADDEN: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right. 
And now, why  why is 

15

this  you could  why  why  is it in his 

16

possession?  What they're thinking about with (f), is 

17

they're thinking about the aunt left a legacy which he 

18

received after he filed the 13.  And what they want to 

19

do is make certain that that legacy is counted as part 

20

of the 7 estate, isn't that right? 

21
22
23
24
25

 MR. MADDEN: 

I think that's part of what 

Congress intended, but 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I couldn't find a word that 

suggests anything else.  You point to it. 
 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, there's nothing in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

Section 348(f) that distinguishes postpetition property 

2

that's held by the debtor versus postpetition property 

3

that's held by the trustee.  When Congress enacted the 

4

statute, it intended to define what would remain 

5

property of the estate in a case going forward, and it 

6

didn't distinguish 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, what's the answer to 

8

my first question, where I pointed to two words, 

9

possession and control? 

10

 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, I think when a case ends 

11

and the trustee's service is terminated, the property of 

12

the estate that the trustee is holding is in the control 

13

of the debtor, because it becomes the debtor's property, 

14

if it's no longer property 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So is this a revocable 

16

or irrevocable trust?  If you can convert, you're 

17

claiming it's a revocable trust, correct? 

18

 MR. MADDEN: 

I  I think if any analogy 

19

from the common law applies, Justice Sotomayor, it would 

20

be that of a revocable trust, because Congress has been 

21

very clear in Section 1307(a) that a debtor has the 

22

right to convert his case out of Chapter 13 and into 

23

Chapter 7 at any time. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So if it's a revocable 

trust, what's the trust law in that situation?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

 MR. MADDEN: 

A settler in a revocable trust 

2

obtains the corpus of the trust upon revocation.  That's 

3

effectively what Congress has said here, because when a 

4

case leaves Chapter 13 and enters Chapter 7, it's 

5

Chapter 7 that governs.  A new Chapter 7 trustee is 

6

appointed to administer the case and that trustee 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So how is that in 

8

practice?  Is it  when a 13 gets converted to a 7, so 

9

the trustee in the 13 is out, is it common to appoint a 

10

different person, or is it the same person with a new 

11

hat? 

12

 MR. MADDEN: 

It's usually a different 

13

person.  So in this case, when Petitioner converted his 

14

case from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, the court docket 

15

reflected that Respondent's service had terminated and 

16

an interim Chapter 7 trustee was appointed the very next 

17

day. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Would your problem, 

19

the issue, be moot in 99 percent of the cases if the 

20

trustee decided to adopt a procedure which will provide 

21

for a distribution at the end of every day? 

22

 MR. MADDEN: 

If a trustee has already 

23

distributed the money to creditors lawfully under a 

24

plan, then, yes, that property has left the estate. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

So it would only be

Official

11
1

the rare situation when this  even rarer than now, 

2

when this arises, and presumably trustees who wish to 

3

distribute to creditors can adopt the sort of rule that 

4

they desire. 

5

 MR. MADDEN: 

Yes, but because trustees are 

6

fiduciaries of the estate and represent the estate, 

7

they're not allowed to dissipate estate assets by making 

8

frequent or even constant distributions.  And it's 

9

it's because they're the representative of the estate 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I suppose if 

11

there's a particularly difficult  and maybe this is 

12

such a case  where the trustee has to take some time 

13

to figure it out, perhaps.  But in a fortuitous case 

14

where the wages arrive on a Wednesday or whatever, it 

15

doesn't seem to me that this would raise serious 

16

concerns. 

17

 And the consequence of that is it becomes 

18

even more fortuitous when the assets come within the 

19

control of the trustee, so that a rule that says there's 

20

a huge difference based on the fortuity of the timing 

21

might not make much sense. 

22

 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, I think that's the rule, 

23

respectfully, that Congress adopted when they allowed 

24

debtors to make the conversion at any time.  Congress 

25

didn't require a debtor to give notice, and Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

didn't make conversion effective only after 

2

disbursements. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about the parties? 

4

Can they  can they handle the situation by providing 

5

in the  in the Chapter 13 agreement that any funds 

6

remaining, if there should be a conversion, will be 

7

distributed among the creditors? 

8
9

 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, what they can't do is 

undermine the effects of conversion, because under 

10

Section 1307 of the Code, the debtor's right to convert 

11

the case at any time is not 

12
13
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So your answer is no, the 

parties could not  could not do that. 
 MR. MADDEN: 

That's right, the answer is no 

15

in that the parties can't undermine the effective 

16

conversion. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why would Congress adopt a 

18

rule that depends so much on happenstance?  I mean, you 

19

know, if  if the trustee distributes the money 

20

promptly, there's nothing there.  If he waits three 

21

months, the  the debtor gets it all back.  It's 

22

it's random, just utterly  why would anybody adopt a 

23

rule like that? 

24
25

 MR. MADDEN: 

I think the rule is adopted 

here because Chapter 13 is, in essence, a voluntary

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

proceeding.  A  a debtor has to elect to put his 

2

future income into the estate in the first place by 

3

treating 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah, but he doesn't know 

5

whether this random event is going to happen or not 

6

when  when he does that.  So you're saying that 

7

Congress is forcing the debtor, and the creditors, I 

8

suppose, to roll the dice, right?  He doesn't know what 

9

he's going to get back; it depends on whether the 

10
11

trustee is lazy or not. 
 MR. MADDEN: 

Sometimes, but there are cases 

12

like this one, Your Honor, where it's not mere 

13

happenstance.  Respondent was holding funds in this 

14

case, because Chase, the mortgage lender, had received 

15

relief from the stay.  So funds that had been earmarked 

16

for Chase, so that no creditor under the plan was going 

17

to get other than Chase, were being held while Chase and 

18

the debtor 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's  no, that's 

20

exactly the question I have that Justice Scalia just 

21

raised.  And I'd like you to think about that.  You 

22

practice bankruptcy law, so you're familiar with it in 

23

your experience.  Now, I  assume with me for the 

24

moment that the language does not resolve this.  The 

25

funds are not in the possession of the debtor.  The

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

question is whether he nonetheless still controls them, 

2

i.e. gets them back.  All right?  So that's the 

3

assumption. 

4

 Now, I had exactly the same reaction, I 

5

think, the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia had, that in 

6

the mine run of bankruptcy cases, whether a trustee at 

7

the moment of conversion is holding funds that he 

8

should  that will be distributed to creditors, but 

9

they haven't been yet is a fluke, chance. 

10

 Sometimes there might be a lot, sometimes 

11

there might be a little.  It depends on when the mail 

12

went out that day.  It depends on unusual circumstances 

13

such as the one in this case, and you shouldn't turn a 

14

rule of law on that.  You'll produce a  you produce 

15

gaming and who knows what will happen. 

16

 Now, you've heard the question. 

Is the 

17

thrust of the question, which I think you've now gotten 

18

three times, right or wrong?  Is it chance?  Is it a 

19

fluke?  And I've talked very slowly, so I want to be 

20

sure that you get this question, because it's important 

21

to me how you answer it. 

22

 MR. MADDEN: 

I think the answer is that, 

23

yes, there are some cases in which this will be 

24

happenstance, but Congress has spoken to those cases by 

25

allowing 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, but that isn't my 

2

question about what Congress wants.  My question is, in 

3

your experience, what is it?  Is it that happenstance 

4

governs, 50/50, almost never, what's your experience? 

5

 MR. MADDEN: 

I don't know from a survey of 

6

the  of the bankruptcy 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8

 MR. MADDEN: 

9
10

No, from your experience. 
Well, my experience may not be 

as  as broad as 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But what is your 

11

experience?  I would just be curious.  I'm trying to get 

12

some kind of a rough answer. 

13

 MR. MADDEN: 

Here's what I can tell you, 

14

Justice Breyer.  I think that most Chapter 13 cases are 

15

converted because the debtor has stopped being able to 

16

make his payments.  So in the mine run of cases, there's 

17

not really funds in the  that the trustee is holding. 

18

 I think what happens are cases like these, 

19

where there  where funds have built up in the 

20

trustee's possession for a reason, and that's because 

21

the creditor to whom they were earmarked can no longer 

22

obtain those funds under the plan. 

23

 Now, Congress has spoken to this by allowing 

24

the debtor in this circumstance, or any other, to make 

25

the conversion at any time because Chapter 13 has been a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1
2

voluntarily proceeding. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I  I don't understand. 

3

The three months' wages have  have accumulated in the 

4

estate.  In the ordinary course, if there's no change, 

5

they're going to go out to the creditors.  And you just 

6

said that the creditors can't get them?  I didn't quite 

7

get that.  They can't get them only because, as the 

8

questions have indicated, that the trustee is doing 

9

something else for a week. 

10

 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, they would go to the 

11

creditors if, in performing the trustee's service, the 

12

trustee, in following the plan, eventually disburses 

13

them to creditors.  But that's what's important, is that 

14

the trustee has to be making  has to be following her 

15

service to disburse funds in the case. 

16

 Now, under Section 348(e) of the Code, the 

17

trustee's service ends at conversion.  Now, I think both 

18

parties agree that a core function of that service 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that doesn't answer 

20

the fortuity point, other than what you say the 

21

that's the statute and that's it. 

22

 MR. MADDEN: 

I think that's right.  I  I 

23

think at the end of the day, if a case  if  if funds 

24

are in the estate by happenstance, because they just 

25

haven't gone out in the next disbursement, that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

has made the election that the  that the debtor is 

2

still entitled to convert this case at any time. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could I 
Mr. Madden. 
 follow up on your 

6

statement about in this case, the plan called for the 

7

bulk of this money to go to Chase; correct? 

8
9
10
11

 MR. MADDEN: 

Yes, that's right.  Especially 

early in the plan. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Early in the plan.  And 

you said Chase couldn't get the bulk of this money, why? 

12

 MR. MADDEN: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 MR. MADDEN: 

Because 
It had foreclosed. 
Not yet.  They had obtained 

15

relief from the automatic stay in the bankruptcy case. 

16

So what happened here is the Petitioner was supposed to 

17

make his current mortgage payments, what's called 

18

outside of the plan or directly to Chase, and because of 

19

circumstances, debtor found himself unable to make those 

20

payments.  And so then when that happened, Chase went to 

21

the bankruptcy court and received relief from the 

22

automatic stay which allowed them to foreclose.  But 

23

that didn't resolve their claim in the case.

 So what the Trustee explains in her brief 
that she did was to reserve the funds that had been

earmarked for Chase, so that  because it's a common 

2

circumstance that the mortgage lender and the debtor 

3

will then work out a modification of the loan

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

she didn't give the money to Chase.

 MR. MADDEN:

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But finish this  but 

No.  That's correct. 
She decided to 

distribute it to the other creditors. 
 MR. MADDEN: 

That's exactly right. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What permitted that in 

the plan? 
 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, nothing permitted that in 

13

the plan until both secured creditors had been paid in 

14

full.  Now, importantly, in this case, neither of 

15

Petitioner's secured creditors under the plan had been 

16

paid in full on the day he converted his case from 

17

Chapter 13 to Chapter 9.  It was only  Respondent 

18

ended up filing a document in the bankruptcy court 

19

called the trustee's recommendation concerning claims in 

20

which the  the treatment of Chase's claims changed, 

21

but her service had terminated by that point under 

22

Section 348(e) of the Code.  And so this case presents 

23

an interesting example of what happens if you end up 

24

with two trustees performing in the case at the same 

25

time.

There was never any

4

never any distribution.  They were just held.  Is 

5

that 

6

 MR. MADDEN: 

The funds at issue in this case 

7

had just been held.  There had been distributions in the 

8

case while the case had proceeded, so Chase had received 

9

some 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How is that  how is it 

11

determined what the frequency of payments will be to the 

12

creditors? 

13

 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, those are determined both 

14

in the Trustee's service as the trustee and reading the 

15

plan terms and  and the Bankruptcy Code, but it  but 

16

it's generally covered by the confirmed plan.  And so 

17

the confirmed plan in this case required secured 

18

creditors to get paid first before any unsecured 

19

creditors were paid. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But does the plan say 

21

payments will be made once a week, or once a month, 

22

or 

23

 MR. MADDEN: 

To some secured creditors, it 

24

suggested the payments will be made monthly, but 

25

unsecured creditors aren't entitled to payment at any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

time during the plan.  They're  they're effectively 

2

entitled to the funds that are left over after creditors 

3

who have higher priority are  are paid first. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Madden, I've been 

5

thinking about your response to my earlier question 

6

about whether this issue could be covered in the plan if 

7

the plan said that, you know, any funds still held by 

8

the trustee shall be distributed to the  to the 

9

creditors. 

10

 Your answer was it couldn't because it would 

11

contradict the  the statutory requirement, but there 

12

isn't any statutory requirement.  I mean, that's what 

13

we're dealing with.  We're dealing with an absolute 

14

void.  The statute doesn't say what will happen to this 

15

money.  If a statute doesn't say so, what's wrong with 

16

having  having the parties adopt a provision in the 

17

plan that says that? 

18

 And, by the way, in my estimation, this 

19

helps your case because I am much more willing to buy 

20

onto a random rule of law that the parties can contract 

21

out of than a random rule of law that has to be applied 

22

in the future.  And you're  and what you're urging 

23

upon us is a random rule of law.  You're just saying, 

24

well, you know, Congress wanted randomness.  Well, 

25

maybe.

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. MADDEN: 

The Third Circuit in deciding 

2

this issue did suggest in a footnote that Your Honor's 

3

position might be an out the parties could take.  I 

4

think there would just  there would be two constraints 

5

on that issue in another case that isn't presented here. 

6

One is that a plan can only provide what The Code allows 

7

the plan to provide.  So what the Chapter 13 plan can 

8

provide is specified in Section 1322 of The Code.  And 

9

The Code provides that a debtor could vest property of 

10

the estate in any other entity, so a debtor could vest 

11

property in specific entities.  But there's no provision 

12

in the Code that allows a debtor to vest property 

13

generally in creditors. 

14

 And the second problem, as I  as I 

15

mentioned earlier, I said under Section 1307(a) of the 

16

Code, a waiver of the right to convert a case at any 

17

time is unenforceable.  So if there's a provision in the 

18

plan that undermines the natural statutory effective 

19

conversion by keeping the  keeping property of the 

20

estate larger in a case of good faith conversion or 

21

asking the trustee to continue performing the service of 

22

the trustee after conversion, those provisions of a plan 

23

would be unenforceable. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Madden, there's a 

there's a policy argument that cuts against you, which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

the Fifth Circuit talked about.  And, of course, it's 

2

only relevant if the statute doesn't say much of 

3

anything about this.  But let's assume for this purpose 

4

that the statute doesn't say much of anything about 

5

this, and what the Fifth Circuit said was that Chapter 

6

13 is essentially a quid pro quo, that  the debtor 

7

gives up a certain amount of his wages, but in exchange, 

8

the debtor gets to keep his assets.  And here what the 

9

debtor is essentially asking for is to get back the 

10

wages, but he's gotten the benefit of having kept his 

11

assets.  So he's kind of asking for the quid without the 

12

quo or the quo without the quid, or whatever it is. 

13

 So what's your response to that? 

14

 MR. MADDEN: 

I think there are a number of 

15

problems with viewing Chapter 13 through that lens. 

16

Chapter 13 is better for debtors and creditors alike, 

17

that everyone comes out ahead because no creditor can 

18

receive less under a Chapter 13 plan than they would be 

19

entitled to receive under a Chapter 7 liquidation.  So 

20

Congress  and generally, the policy of the Bankruptcy 

21

Code is intended to encourage debtors into Chapter 13 

22

because it's better for everyone.  The idea that a 

23

debtor sort of rents the benefits of Chapter 13 from his 

24

creditors who stands to gain from him doing so doesn't 

25

make a whole lot of sense under the way the Bankruptcy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1
2

Code is structured. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What about  I 

3

gather there can be payments directly to the creditors. 

4

What  those, I assume, they get those without having 

5

to worry about this problem? 

6

 MR. MADDEN: 

That's correct.  Under Chapter 

7

13, either the debtor or the trustee can be the 

8

disbursing agent under the plan, but in either case, 

9

it's when the money is disbursed by the disbursing agent 

10
11

that the rights shift to the creditors. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No.  But in the case 

12

of the creditor who is paid directly, that's  there's 

13

sort of no middleman, right? 

14

 MR. MADDEN: 

That's right.  But the question 

15

is whether the  when they've been paid, the property 

16

leaves the estate and becomes property of the creditors. 

17

Now 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No.  But, I guess, 

19

I'm just trying to highlight another randomness in 

20

fortuity in that some creditors will be  get their 

21

money directly, others it will go through the estate, 

22

and if you get your money directly, you're not going to 

23

have to worry about this. 

24
25

 MR. MADDEN: 

That's true if the debtor keeps 

up his payments.  The reason why  I think most

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

creditors like the trustee to be holding funds in the 

2

estate, subject to future disbursements as appropriate, 

3

is that that increases the likelihood of success of the 

4

plan. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

How does that work 

6

as a practical matter?  Is there direct deposit of a 

7

portion of wages with a creditor? 

8
9

 MR. MADDEN: 

It varies from case to case. 

In this case, Respondent effectively had  it was 

10

called a wage order.  So Petitioner's employer sent a 

11

portion of his income directly to the Trustee every 

12

month.  Now 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What  what would 

14

happen  let's suppose you're right.  The trustee has 

15

given this money to the creditors, and she wasn't 

16

supposed to do that.  The debtor was supposed to get 

17

them.  What happens now?  How do we undo what has 

18

already been done? 

19

 MR. MADDEN: 

Well, Respondent may be able to 

20

get the money back from the creditors with whom she has 

21

relationships and rights.  Ultimately, the liability is 

22

the trustee's for 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So it would be personal 

liability on the part of the trustee? 
 MR. MADDEN: 

That's right.  And so the order

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

in the bankruptcy case is that in order for Respondent 

2

to  to pay this sum of money to the Petitioner.  Now, 

3

that's because when trustees act outside their service, 

4

that's how the liability works in the Bankruptcy Code. 

5

And I think both parties agree that it's a core function 

6

of the trustee's service in a bankruptcy case to make 

7

disbursements to creditors.  Under Section 348(e) of the 

8

Code, that service has to end at conversion. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10

insurance, right? 

11

 MR. MADDEN: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

I assume that trustees have 

That's right. 
So we don't have to feel 

sorry for this lady. 

14

 (Laughter.) 

15

 MR. MADDEN: 

Yes.  They have what's called 

16

errors and omissions insurance that covers this sort of 

17

thing. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I assume there would also 

19

be a right to recoup from the creditor if the creditor 

20

has received something improperly paid. 

21

 MR. MADDEN: 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

23
24
25

There may be.  I think 
Like standard recoupment 

principles. 
 MR. MADDEN: 

I think that may  may well be 

true, Your Honor.  I think returning to the point about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

the  the ending of the trustee's service, the 

2

practical significance of that is that Congress didn't 

3

want two trustees functioning in a case at the same 

4

time.  Once the case had been converted, all of the 

5

claims against the estate in the Chapter 13 case 

6

automatically became claims against the estate in the 

7

Chapter 7 case. 

8
9

 And so what happened here is you had a 
Chapter 13 trustee still acting on and paying claims as 

10

though Chapter 13 was still going.  All the while, a 

11

Chapter 7 trustee had taken over the reins of being the 

12

representative of the estate and dealing with claims. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But the  the money that's 

14

in the hands of the trustee at the moment that the 

15

Chapter 7 petition is filed will probably be wages that, 

16

under the 13 plan, were to be distributed to creditors. 

17

And the trustee has to make out a check to somebody. 

18

 So the only question is: 

Is the name of the 

19

trustee X, which is the creditor to which it has gone, 

20

or is the name Y, which is the debtor or the equivalent? 

21

 So I don't see how we get very far saying 

22

that the trustee's services have ended at that point. 

23

No one thinks the trustee would keep the money.  And, 

24

again, six of one, half a dozen of the other. 

25

 MR. MADDEN: 

But I think there's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

difference here because the trustee's core function, 

2

while serving as trustee and while serving as the 

3

representative of the estate under the Code, is to 

4

disburse funds to creditors. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why do you think that the 

6

trustees have filed a brief on the other side?  I'm 

7

I'm not  I  I read the brief; it makes a series of 

8

legal arguments.  But they must  what do they care? 

9

They obviously care, and I don't  I'll ask, perhaps, 

10

them the question.  But what's your view of that?  Why 

11

do they care, since it's just a matter of writing what 

12

name to write in? 

13

 MR. MADDEN: 

14
15
16
17

I  I think that may be a 

better question for my  my colleague, but 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, what's your view of 

it?  I don't want to ask them without getting your view. 
 MR. MADDEN: 

I  I think the trustee is 

18

attempting to  to send funds to whoever the trustee is 

19

supposed to send funds to, and many

backdrop against which the

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

Well, but 
 plan is written. 
 the problem is that 

upon conversion, it nullifies the plan. 

17

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Justice Sotomayor 
So what's the remaining 

19

power that you have to distribute the funds to 

20

creditors? 

21

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So, Justice Sotomayor, that 

22

is a problem that arises not just in bankruptcy, but 

23

under the common law all the time.  A trust can 

24

terminate, and a trustee can be holding funds and is 

25

left with the question of do these go back to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

grantor?  Do I pay them backwards, or do I pay them 

2

forwards? 

3

 And long before there was a Bankruptcy Code, 

4

there was an established common law principle that says, 

5

first, the trust pays the obligations of the trust, and 

6

the obligations of the trust include matured claims of 

7

beneficiaries.  That's the rule that  that comes out 

8

of Section 235(a) in the Second Restatement and 

9

Section 89 of the Third Restatement, and the Bankruptcy 

10
11

Code was written against that common law backdrop. 
 And  and where the Code  there are 

12

indications in the Code  we think those indications 

13

support the  the notion that it's consistent with the 

14

common law that they be paid forward.  But to the extent 

15

the Court were to conclude that nothing in the 

16

Bankruptcy Code helps answer the question, there is 

17

surely no reason to think that Congress intended to 

18

abrogate that established common law 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, it 
 backdrop. 
 certainly did, 

22

because it  it  it has said upon conversion, you 

23

have to give everything to the Chapter 7 trustee 

24

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So if I could  Section 
 that's in the control

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

or possession of the debtor.  But if it hasn't vested in 

2

the creditors, then 

3

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5

So, Justice Sotomayor 
 how  how  what 

remains to 

6

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So if I  if I can explain, 

7

Section 348(f), which is the provision I believe you're 

8

referring to, says the following.  It says that upon the 

9

conversion of the case, the Chapter  the Chapter 7 

10

estate is made up of the assets that the debtor had on 

11

the petition date that they still have on the conversion 

12

date. 

13

 So there's the question  the question 

14

Congress was dealing with is  is exactly the question 

15

that Justice Breyer was referring to, which is, let's 

16

say during the course of the 13, there's some sort of 

17

windfall that comes into the estate.  Does that become 

18

part of the Chapter 7 estate?  And the answer to that is 

19

no. 

20

 But that  that  that determination says 

21

nothing about funds that the debtor already paid out to 

22

the trustee at a time when the debtor was required to 

23

pay those funds to the trustee in order to obtain the 

24

benefits of being in Chapter 13 at that time. 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, it  it at least

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

raises the question why you should treat differently 

2

the  let's say the inheritance from the new wages.  In 

3

other words, say, the new wages come in.  They're 

4

garnished.  It goes straight to the trustee.  But that's 

5

also a fortuity.  You know, why should you treat 

6

the wages different from the inheritance? 

7

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So  so, Justice Kagan, 

8

the  the answer is because the  the debtor made a 

9

decision to pay these funds over to the trustee.  Here 

10

the decision was done through a garnishment order, but 

11

that itself is, of course, itself a fortuity.  What 

12

we're talking about are funds that a debtor made a 

13

voluntary decision to pay over to a trustee in order to 

14

remain in Chapter 13.  If the debtor 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, until he decided to 

switch the petition to a Chapter 7. 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

That  that's right.  He 

18

could have done that at  at any time.  So the debtor 

19

here had the ability, as soon as Chase received relief 

20

from the stay, to convert at that time. 

21

 The debtor didn't make that decision. 

The 

22

debtor instead decided, for the remaining 12 months, to 

23

remain in Chapter 13 and to obtain the benefits of being 

24

in Chapter 13, precisely the quid pro quo that Your 

25

Honor was describing and that the Court described in

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

How does it work in a 


revocable trust, a revocable trust? 


4


 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

5


 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So 

Let's imagine that on 

6

on  under the terms of the trust on February 1, Joe 

7

Smith gets a $100.  All right. 

8

 On March 1, the settlor revokes the trust. 

9

There is money in the trust that would pay his monthly 

10

payment on February 1, on March 1, on April 1.  That's 

11

$300 that he has, $100 after it's revoked and $100 

12

before it's revoked. 

13

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

15
16

So 
How does it work under the 

law of revocable trust? 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So, Justice Breyer, Section 

17

235(a) of the Second Restatement of Trusts deals exactly 

18

with this question.  The answer is the revocation 

19

here  the  the debtor's decision to convert 

20

effectively operated as a revocation.  Because of that, 

21

the remaining three years' worth of payments that he 

22

otherwise would have been obligated to pay, he didn't 

23

have to pay.  But as to the funds that were already in 

24

the trust as  where the obligations have matured, 

25

the  the  the trustee is required to pay those

Alderson Reporting Company

34
1
2

matured obligations.  The situation that's in 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

In other words, in my 

3

example, the January money which is owed before the 

4

revocation goes to the beneficiary. 

5

 MR. GOLDBLATT:

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

7

back to the settlor. 

8

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's exactly 
But the March money goes 

That's exactly right. 
And you're saying the same 

10

is true here, that the prepetition 7 money that was 

11

owed and not paid should, if in the hands of the  of 

12

the trustee, go to the creditor; that any money that he 

13

has, which is for the creditors, where they are not yet 

14

entitled to it  say, like, an early payment of the 

15

next month's  they go back to the  to the debtor. 

16

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Justice Breyer, I think 

17

that's exactly right.  Section 235(a) of the  the 

18

Second Restatement of Trusts talks about the life 

19

beneficiary who is entitled to all of the income of a 

20

trust during their life.  Income comes in while they're 

21

alive, but before it's paid, they die.  The question is 

22

does that  where does that go?  Does it go back to the 

23

grantor, or does it go to the estate of the life 

24

beneficiary? 

25

 And the answer that Section 235(a) says is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

it goes to the  to the estate of the life beneficiary 

2

because that obligation matured under the terms of the 

3

trust before the revocation.  That same principle, I 

4

think, is fully applicable here for exactly the reasons 

5

that

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

When 

 Your Honor describes. 
 when we talk 

maybe this is too abstract a way to envision of it, but 

10

when we talk of an estate, it's somebody's estate, 

11

right?  John Smith dies.  He leaves an estate. 

12

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
We call it John 

14

Smith's estate.  Here, you know, we call this 

15

Mr. Harris's estate, at least more naturally than we 

16

would call it, you know, Consumer Electronics's, 

17

Chase Manhattan's whatever's, estate.  And isn't that 

18

a  a fairly strong signal of who should get the stuff 

19

that's kind of left in the middle? 

20

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Mr. Chief Justice, the 

21

the  the Bankruptcy Code  it  it is his estate, 

22

but it's his estate in  in  to  to be paid in 

23

consistent with the terms of the plan. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No.  I  I 

understand that.  As I said, just sort of looking at it

Alderson Reporting Company

36

from a more conceptual level, it does seem that it's 

2

it's  well, I guess I can't say it more than that. 

3

It's his estate, so stuff that you can't decide where it 

4

goes ought to go to him. 

5

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

I don't think that 

6

nomenclature should overtake the  the  the structure 

7

and purpose of  of the Code.  And if I  if I may, 

8

while it's

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

debtor's estate or is it called the Chapter 13 estate? 

11

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13
14

Is it normally called the 

I  I 
I would normally say the 

Chapter 13 estate. 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

In fairness, Justice Scalia, 

15

I've heard it used both ways colloquially.  Before 

16

abandoning the text, though, in fairness, this is not a 

17

case in which the language of the Code is entirely 

18

there are clear indications from the text of the Code 

19

that do help answer the question, and are consistent 

20

with the common law backdrop.  For example, under 

21

Section 1328(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, it says, the 

22

debtor is entitled to the discharge upon the debtor's 

23

completion of the payments he's required to make under 

24

the plan. 

25

 It doesn't say when the trustee distributes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

that money to creditors.  It says when the  when the 

2

debtor makes the last payment he's required to make 

3

under the trustee, which is at least a signal that the 

4

legally operative moment within  that Congress was 

5

contemplating, was the debtor making the planned 

6

payment.

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What about  back to the 

trustee, just for a moment, of a revocable trust. 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
Now, the standard trust 

11

law, CJS, when the grantor exercises a power of 

12

revocation, the interest of the beneficiary ceases, and 

13

the assignee of the grant or namely the grantor, takes 

14

the corpus of the trust free from the trust.  But what 

15

you are saying is, if I look further into that, I will 

16

discover that if the grantor revoked the trust on 

17

February 1, and if under the trust documents, a $100 is 

18

due to a beneficiary on January 1, and on March 1, 

19

standard trust law is the beneficiary gets the $100 from 

20

January and does not get the $100 from March. 

21
22
23

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

That  that's exactly 

right, I 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  And the thing 

24

that I will look up in the trust law to show that, you 

25

gave me the cite, and I lost it.

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

It's Section 89 of the third 

restatement 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And you're saying that's 

precisely how we should treat this? 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

That is correct.  That there 

6

is nothing in the Bankruptcy Code that is inconsistent 

7

with that 

8

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's how you want to 

treat it? 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

We think that's  that's 

11

correct, yes.  In addition to the provision regarding 

12

the 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Has anyone else, any 

14

other circuit, bankruptcy court, treated your function 

15

as that of a typical trustee?  I mean 

16

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

Well 
So, you're not a typical 

trustee, you're  you're  of an escrow account.

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

estate or for the debtor. 

22

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

That's correct. 
You're a trustee for the 

So it's a creature created 

23

by the Bankruptcy Code that is in some ways a hybrid 

24

of  of escrow law and trust law.  We think that's the 

25

best way to think about it.  As between the two, they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

both point the same direction, so I don't think a great 

2

deal turns on whether the lens of the common law here is 

3

that of escrow or that of trust.  There are cases, a 

4

number of them, that have talked about the role of the 

5

trustee by reference to the common law of trust. 

6

Congress did, after all, use the term trustee, which is 

7

some indication that it was drawing on the common law 

8

backdrop of trust in thinking about this question. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Goldblatt, what do you 

10

do about the argument that what you're asking to be done 

11

cannot be done, because immediately upon the conversion, 

12

the Chapter 13 Trustee no longer has any powers? 

13

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So, Justice Scalia, that 

14

that argument from Section 348(e) of the Bankruptcy Code 

15

simply proves too much, as was suggested earlier.  The 

16

trustee clearly has to distribute the money to someone. 

17

They have to write a check either to the debtor or to 

18

creditors.  The question is to  who is legally 

19

entitled to the funds?  And that is the answer that 

20

drives the resolution of this case.  The notion that 

21

no one is suggesting the trustee keeps the money 

22

herself.  She obviously needs to distribute it, and that 

23

common law with trusts terminate, and there is a 

24

doctrine about the wind up obligations of the trustee 

25

upon termination.

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So I suppose you're saying 

2

that  that the service of the trustee is owed both to 

3

the debtor and the creditors.  If it were to the 

4

creditors, then you would have a weaker position. 

5

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

In fairness, Justice 

6

Kennedy, the  the obligation that the trustee has to 

7

carry out the terms of the plan.  That includes 

8

obligations that run for the benefit of creditors and 

9

some that run 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What about the provision 

11

that if the conversion is made in bad faith, then the 

12

estate consists of the property as of the date of the 

13

conversion. 

14
15
16

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Right, so Justice Kennedy, 

that deals 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So the statute appears to 

17

make it  a specific requirement for that, but not 

18

for  for the case we have. 

19

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So, Justice Kennedy, that 

20

provision of 348, of 348(f), deals with the situation 

21

that Justice Breyer was referring to, which is, what if 

22

the debtor during the life of the Chapter 13 case 

23

received an inheritance?  So money that the debtor still 

24

had, hadn't yet voluntarily paid over to the trustee, 

25

received an inheritance, but she converted in an act of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1
2

gamesmanship. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but I would suppose 

3

it would apply to your case, too.  Property of the 

4

estate as of the date. 

5

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So if  the language of 

6

348(f) does the following:  It says that the  the 

7

property of the Chapter 7 estate is the property that 

8

the question that Congress had when it dealt with 348(f) 

9

is the debtor files a Chapter 13 case on day one, lives 

10

in Chapter 13 for some period of time, and then 

11

converts. 

12

 So the question is: 

Okay, what universe of 

13

property is in the Chapter 7 estate?  Is it all the 

14

property the debtor had at the beginning of the case or 

15

is it the property the debtor had on the day of 

16

conversion?  That was a fair question and there was 

17

disagreement in the courts on that question until 1994. 

18

 Congress answered that question by saying, 

19

the property of the 13 estate is the property that the 

20

debtor had on the petition date, the original petition 

21

date, that they still have as of the date of conversion. 

22

 And the reason that makes sense is for the 

23

reason Justice Breyer identified.  Because otherwise, 

24

someone who came into some sort of windfall during that 

25

period of time would essentially have to turn that all

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

over to creditors instead of keeping it.  So the  so 

2

the  or actually, even  even more directly and the 

3

Third Circuit talks about this, in the In ReMichael 

4

decision, if the debtor's home reacquired equity during 

5

the course of the bankruptcy, or if the debtor just 

6

saved a lot  worked hard and saved money, the notion 

7

is by defining the estate that way, it allowed the 

8

debtor to keep what the debtor had obtained during the 

9

life of the Chapter 13, even when it converts.  But that 

10

doesn't say a word about what happens to funds that the 

11

debtor paid during the bankruptcy in order to obtain the 

12

benefits of being in Chapter 13. 

13

 There is a clear quid pro quo here. 

The 

14

cost of being in Chapter 13, as this Court explained in 

15

Ransom v. Lanham, and in Ransom  I'm sorry, and in the 

16

Lanning case, is that the cost under Section 325(a)(2) 

17

is the debtor is required to pay all of his projected 

18

disposable income for the benefit of his unsecured 

19

creditors, that is the cost.  The benefit the debtor 

20

obtains on the other side is he gets to keep his 

21

assets 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But there's also a policy 

23

argument, Mr. Goldblatt, that works against you, which 

24

is that one of the things we know is that Congress 

25

didn't want to disincentivize debtors from using Chapter

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

13.  And essentially, if you win, under your argument, 

2

the debtor is worse off for having tried Chapter 13 than 

3

if he had gone into Chapter 7 initially, because he's 

4

now being put to paying down debt that would have been 

5

discharged under Chapter 7, and why should we give him 

6

that kind of double whammy, given Congress's view that 

7

we should want people to try Chapter 13 first. 

8
9

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So, Justice Kagan, a few 

different answers, if I may.  First, under Section 

10

707(d)(2)(A), a debtor with above median income may 

11

not  is presumptively abusive if they file for Chapter 

12

7 in the first instance.  And here the  the record 

13

which includes the description at Joint Appendix Page 

14

37, shows that this debtor's income was $49,000 a year, 

15

so I understand the question. 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That is a very casespecific 

answer. 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

No, I understand that, so 

19

but not every  the point being that not every debtor 

20

is eligible to file for 7 to begin with.  There are some 

21

who must file for Chapter 13, including, we believe, 

22

this debtor.  More broadly, because of the happenstance 

23

of this case, it is indeed fanciful to believe that any 

24

debtor is goingin decision about whether to file for 

25

Chapter 13 is going to be affected.  The debtor of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

course has no control over when the trustee makes 

2

payments, and he 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, wait.  It seems to me 

4

it is always a disadvantage to the debtor who converts 

5

to have begun in Chapter 13.  Whether there is any money 

6

left in the pot or not, he will have paid his wages to 

7

his creditors, whereas if he had filed for Chapter 7 

8

immediately, he wouldn't have had to do that. 

9

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Justice Scalia, that's  in 

10

fairness, that's probably right, that after the 

11

viewed after the fact 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, it is absolutely 

13

right, but your exacerbating the effect of that under 

14

your proposed rule. 

15

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

But, Justice Kagan, not in a 

16

way that  that could possibly provide a material 

17

effect on anyone's incentives.  After all, the debtor 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, possibly.  But it's at 

19

least an extra penalty that you are imposing on him, and 

20

 and, you know, one way to look at what Congress 

21

wanted to do here is in terms of incentives.  Another 

22

way is just to say,  we shouldn't penalize people for 

23

going into Chapter 13 first. 

24
25

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Right.  But  but, Justice 

Kagan, in fairness, this isn't a penalty.  After all,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

had the Trustee distributed these funds to creditors 

2

before the date of conversion, no one would say that 

3

that operated to penalize the debtor. 

4

 So viewing it as a penalty, I think, begins 

5

with the conclusion that there's a baseline entitlement 

6

to these funds to begin with.  And that assumption is 

7

is incorrect and inconsistent with the structure of the 

8

Code. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but I thought that 

10

Congress's baseline is to the extent possible to 

11

make  to  to encourage Chapter 13 and not to impose 

12

extra costs on the people who go there. 

13

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Right.  But  but it's 

14

with respect, it's not an extra cost.  It is clear that 

15

the cost of being in Chapter 13 by the function of the 

16

statute is the debtor is obligated to pay all of his 

17

projected disposable income to the plan for the benefit 

18

of his unsecured creditors as the price of being in 

19

Chapter 13. 

20

 Here the Debtor obtained those benefits. 

He 

21

was able to keep his property throughout the time he was 

22

in Chapter 13. 

23

 To address Justice Sotomayor's question, he 

24

also was able to seek to negotiate with Chase the effort 

25

to modify his mortgage.  So what happened in this case

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

is he reached the conclusion that he couldn't keep his 

2

house under the monthly payments on the mortgage as it 

3

existed, but as commonly occurs, particularly since the 

4

financial crisis, he then undertook to negotiate with 

5

Chase for a modification of the mortgage; could he 

6

reduce the plan payments. 

7

 If  if he could have gotten to a mortgage 

8

modification, that would have been implemented by a 

9

modified plan.  Here he  they tried.  They tried for a 

10

year.  They were ultimately unsuccessful.  But  but 

11

but the opportunity to try is the benefit of Chapter 13, 

12

and it can't be the case that because he was ultimately 

13

unsuccessful you can say that he didn't obtain the 

14

benefit during the period in which he was trying to do 

15

that.  That was a voluntary decision on his part.  He 

16

as  as the Petitioner explains, could have converted 

17

any time. 

18

 So if he didn't want to continue to devote 

19

his projected disposable income under the terms of the 

20

plan while he was doing so, he had every right to 

21

convert as soon as Chase receives stay relief. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Could  could I ask you 

23

the same question I asked your friend on the other side? 

24

Assuming we find against you and  and for the 

25

Petitioner on the issue of  of who gets this money,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

would the parties be able to alter that disposition in 

2

the plan? 

3

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So, Justice Scalia, that's a 

4

really good question and one with which we have 

5

struggled.  We believe that the indications of 

6

congressional intent, that Congress did not mean to 

7

permit this. 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  So you agree with 

your  with the other side on that point? 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Well, we  on the  on the 

11

flip side, we  we think that the better view of the Code 

12

is that  let me  let me enter, if I can, there were 

13

two different questions; right?  One is if there was 

14

language in a plan that did that and that language 

15

that plan was confirmed, would it govern?  The answer to 

16

that, under Espinosa, is obviously yes. 

17

 The  the question I think Your Honor 

18

intends to ask is if a plan said that and someone 

19

objected, could that properly be confirmed?  And our 

20

view is that while that's a close question and 

21

thankfully not the one presented here, that the better 

22

view is that a plan that said the money goes back to the 

23

debtor is sufficiently inconsistent with the structure 

24

 of the Code that  that  that such a plan couldn't be 

25

confirmed, but that is a much closer question than the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

one you have here where there is no language.  And so 

2

the language of the plan should be read against the 

3

common law backdrop, which answers this question 

4

decisively in our favor. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Typically, how 

6

how often are distributions made?  Every three months? 

7

Every 

8
9

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So in  in the ordinary 

case, my understanding and experience is that trustees 

10

will make monthly distributions.  Here  as long as 

11

sufficient funds have accumulated to make that 

12

worthwhile  here, what the Trustee did  what the 

13

Trustee did here makes good sense.  So when Chase got 

14

stay relief, the Trustee was holding money.  Once it got 

15

relief  and, again, this is in response to Justice 

16

Sotomayor's earlier question, the  the plan says what 

17

happens there  it's on the Joint Appendix on pages 34 

18

and 35, and it sets out a priority of payment under the 

19

plan. 

20

 And Chase, when it got stay relief, that 

21

that satisfied in full its secured claim.  Just the 

22

anytime a secured creditor gets back its collateral, 

23

that satisfies the secured claim of the secured 

24

creditor.  So then just going through, to use the 

25

bankruptcy vernacular, the waterfall created by the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

plan, the funds flowed according to  thereto, to the 

2

unsecured creditors after the payment of administrative 

3

claims. 

4

 That's a very common feature of plans, and 

5

typically trustees, when there are material funds to be 

6

distributed, will distribute on a monthly basis.  Here, 

7

the Trustee didn't distribute those funds because the 

8

Debtor presumably wanted the opportunity to take this 

9

time to try to save their house.  So the Trustee was 

10

facilitating the Debtor's efforts to save their house by 

11

holding those funds to see if a modification could be 

12

reached.  And when it wasn't reached, the Trustee said, 

13

okay, now, under the plan, this money goes to unsecured 

14

creditors. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It sounds like 

16

sounds like she's acting in the interests of the Debtor 

17

then. 

18

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

She  she was seeking to 

19

serve the objectives of the Code and the plan.  Chapter 

20

the reason people file for Chapter 13 primarily is to 

21

save their house.  And so that was why the Debtor filed 

22

and the Trustee was trying to do, consistent with the 

23

plan, what the purpose of the case was. 

24
25

 When those efforts failed  the Trustee 
can't, obviously, cause that to succeed.  When it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

failed, the Trustee then did what the plan obligated her 

2

to do. 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

At that moment  at that 

4

very moment when  think of the instant when he filed 

5

the conversion.  As of that particular moment, had the 

6

efforts failed? 

7

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Yes.  By  by  by 

8

converting what the  in Chapter 7, the debtor is 

9

required to turn over all of their nonexempt assets 

10
11

to 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What I'm wondering is that 

12

as of that instant, is it the case that under the 13 

13

plan, as of that instant the funds were already  there 

14

was already on the Trustee, at that instant, a fixed 

15

obligation to write a check to the creditors. 

16

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So 
Then and there. 
Certainly by no later than 

19

the moment of conversion, there was a  there was a 

20

fixed obligation. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  So that's 

22

right.  But if there had been money in that pile which 

23

she was simply keeping for the fulfillment of an 

24

obligation that came up later, that would have under the 

25

plan, that she would have had to return, you concede.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So the question of  of 

2

prepayments is  is more complicated, and  and I 

3

think a fair 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It wouldn't exactly have 

5

been prepayments.  There would have been money there 

6

because of the situation you describe.  And  and if 

7

there was not an obligation as of the Section 7 filing 

8

instance to pay the money then and there to the 

9

unsecured creditors, then I think, under your view of 

10

the case, that money would and should have gone to the 

11

For the same reason as 

you've just said it would occur

In a  in a revocable 

trust. 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So, Justice Breyer, just in 

fairness 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Yes. 
I think there's a difference 

22

between when the creditors right to payment attaches and 

23

when the debtor's obligation to make the payment is. 

24

And what  what would happen if a debtor prefunds the 

25

plan strikes me, just without having thought about it as

hard as perhaps I should have before today, as a 

2

different and perhaps more complicated

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No. 
 case. 
Not at all.  You've 

6

provided an easy principle.  The principle is as in a 

7

revocable trust, the money that is in the trust that is 

8

already under an obligation then and there at the matter 

9

of revocation to go to the beneficiary goes.  But where 

10

that obligation under the trust document has not yet 

11

arisen, it goes back to the settlor.  That's what you've 

12

told me 

13
14
15
16

19

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

I agree with that principle 

100 percent. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And it would apply the same 

here? 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

If  if that's how that 

principle plays out, then  then I agree. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But I still have 

20

problems, which is if you're talking about the Fifth 

21

Circuit saying you don't have a vested right, where does 

22

the  until you're paid by the trustee, and the trustee 

23

hasn't paid you, so where is the preexisting obligation 

24

coming from? 

25

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

So, Justice Sotomayor, the

language 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
creditor.

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Or right of the 

So, Justice Sotomayor 
An insured right of the 

creditor. 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Yes.  Exactly.  So the 

8

the language of vested rights is  is fraught.  And 

9

if  if what is meant by a vested right 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You  you made the 

argument so 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Right.  And if what is meant 

13

by vested right is there is a matured obligation of the 

14

trust, if  if that's what is meant by vested right, 

15

then the  the court below was wrong in that regard. 

16

If it meant by vested right something beyond that, 

17

may  maybe it was right.  I think the legal standard 

18

is there a matured obligation of the trust?  And that 

19

clearly did exist. 

20

 Whether that does or doesn't give rise to a 

21

vested right under some different definition of vesting 

22

is unclear to me.  But what is clear is that the  the 

23

trust had a matured obligation to pay the funds over to 

24

the beneficiary of the trust. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's what I've always

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54

2

thought of as a vested right. 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

Well, then the Fifth 

3

Circuit, in saying there wasn't a vested right, was 

4

incorrect.  So if that is what is meant by vested 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Goldblatt, you might not 

6

be able to answer this question, but I take it from the 

7

fact that the solicitor general is not here in this 

8

case, the government  the Trustees don't care who they 

9

pay this money to as long as they have a clear rule; is 

10
11

that correct? 
 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

I  I don't think that 

12

that's right, Justice Kagan.  Here the National 

13

Association of Chapter 13 Trustees has come in, in 

14

support of  of our position.  The Executive Office of 

15

the United States Trustee plays a very different role in 

16

bankruptcy cases, and so their absence, I think, is 

17

is evidence that the role of that office 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I see. 

19

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

 is different. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And do you think that it 

21

matters to the trustees, to any of them, whether we view 

22

this as a role rule or only as a default rule that can 

23

be changed by the plan?  Is there any reason why they 

24

would care about that question? 

25

 MR. GOLDBLATT: 

I don't  I  in fairness,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

I don't know the answer to that.  It seems  it seems 

2

clear to me that in the absence  that as a default 

3

rule, this is the right answer.  I  I think the 

4

prudent thing to do would be to wait for a case in which 

5

someone sought to change the default to address the next 

6

question of, can you change the default or  or  my 

7

answer  my  I believe that the better view is 

8

probably that you cannot, because there are indications 

9

in the Code that suggest that Congress intended the 

10

application of what we're calling the default rule.  But 

11

whether that's right or wrong, it seems to me, should 

12

properly await a case in which it's  it's actually 

13

presented. 

14

 In sum, the  the question here is, the 

15

debtor is entitled to convert his case to Chapter 7 at 

16

any time.  Everyone agrees that when he does, that 

17

terminates his obligations to make payments into the 

18

trust. 

19

 The question is whether the decision to 

20

terminate essentially is retroactive, that by 

21

terminating  by  by making the decision to convert, 

22

he not only excuses himself of future obligations, but 

23

is able to undo payments he previously made when he 

24

enjoyed the benefits.  And for those reasons, the 

25

judgment should be affirmed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Madden, you have four minutes remaining.

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW M. MADDEN 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

5

 MR. MADDEN: 

6

 Two main  two main points on rebuttal, 

7

Thank you. 

Your Honor. 

8

 First, this case isn't one where you can 

9

make a  a jump to trust law in the restatements, 

10

because to make that jump, Respondent requires the Court 

11

to declare that a Chapter 13 trustee doesn't hold 

12

property of the estate and isn't a representative of 

13

the  of the estate, but, instead, holds a new species 

14

of property as a bankruptcy trustee that already belongs 

15

to creditors and acts as an escrow agent to creditors as 

16

a representative  instead of a representative of the 

17

estate. 

18

 In our reply brief, pages 6 to 7, we point 

19

to a number of indications in the Code where that would 

20

be inconsistent with the way the Bankruptcy Code is 

21

structured. 

22

 To take just one example, the Code gives a 

23

trustee the right to deposit money of the estate in an 

24

interestbearing account, but in the Respondent's view, 

25

after a confirmation of the plan, a Chapter 13 trustee

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

holds property of the creditors and lacks statutory 

2

authorization to make that deposit. 

3

 It would do violence, I think, to the basic 

4

structure of Chapter 13, which would have a number of 

5

implications in other cases, to declare that a Chapter 

6

13 trustee is no longer a representative of an estate 

7

and a fiduciary of an estate, but, instead, is an agent 

8

of the creditors. 

9

 Second, I  the service of the trustee 

10

point which involves Section 348(e) of the Code, 

11

Congress didn't intend to tell a trustee that they can 

12

do nothing at all, and they  they lack any other 

13

powers in a case on how to dispose of money. 

14

 For example, in Bankruptcy Rule 1019, 

15

paragraph 4, a Chapter 13 trustee, upon conversion to 

16

Chapter 7, is required to turn over property of the 

17

estate to the new Chapter 7 trustee.  It's no more a 

18

service that the trustee performs, as the trustee in the 

19

case, to turn over property that is no longer property 

20

of the estate to the debtor. 

21

 The service that the trustee performs is to 

22

take possession of property of the estate, to examine 

23

and object to claims, and when appropriate, to pay  to 

24

pay creditors according to the chapter of the Code under 

25

which the trustee operates.

Alderson Reporting Company

58

 Now, here, that's apparent, because to make 

2

the payments the trustee made in this case, Respondent 

3

had to file a document with the bankruptcy court to 

4

recommend how to treat claims.  As we explained in the 

5

reply brief, Respondent had to tell the court that we 

6

should treat Chase's $5500 claim as being allowed only 

7

in the amount of a thousand dollars, because that 

8

renders Chase paid in full and allows unsecured 

9

creditors to obtain payments under the plan. 

10

 But all of that only happened after the 

11

after the debtor converted his case to Chapter 7.  And 

12

what Congress is intending to prevent is to have two 

13

trustees operating in the same bankruptcy case on the 

14

same estate dealing with the same creditors' claims. 

15

That's what the termination of the service of a trustee 

16

upon conversion means. 

17

 Unless there are further questions.
