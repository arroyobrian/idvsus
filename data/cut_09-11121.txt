ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MS. BLACKMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
J.D.B. was only 13 years old when he was

11
12

taken out of his middle school classroom and escorted to

13

a closed door interrogation conducted by outside law

14

enforcement regarding a matter that did not take place

15

on school property.

16

had already demonstrated an interest in this

17

investigation and sought to shield him from the police.

18

He was not advised that he was free to leave or free not

19

to answer questions until he had already incriminated

20

himself.

21

He was isolated from his family who

The restrictions on J.D.B.'s freedom of

22

movement which existed because of his youth were

23

heightened by the manner in which this officer chose to

24

conduct this interrogation and the expected deference to

25

authority figures categorically characteristic of

children were taken advantage of by the manner in which

2

this officer chose to conduct the interrogation.

I'm not clear on what you are proposing.

proposing is that the test be a court may consider age

So you mean 15, 14, 13,

Right?
MS. BLACKMAN:

We did not suggest that it be

22

calibrated by age, although in State court jurisdictions

23

many of them are and are not finding that a difficult

24

test to perform.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not -- if not

calibrated by age, how is it to be calibrated?
MS. BLACKMAN:

2

It is to be the exercise of

reasonable judgment by the judge taking into account

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. BLACKMAN:

-- community experience is

one.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Common sense?

And -- and -- and how -­

how is the law enforcement officer going into the

10

confrontation going to know whether a judge is going to

11

be applying a 15-year-old rule, a 13-year-old rule, or

12

whatever?

13

MS. BLACKMAN:

Clearly in the jurisdiction

14

in which he practices he should be aware of the fact

15

that a court utilizes that type of -­

Do you think that's clear?
But we're not suggesting that

What a court is examining is -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why isn't this all

subsumed under the voluntariness rule?
MS. BLACKMAN:

As this Court has frequently

22

recognized, the voluntariness inquiry is more difficult

23

for courts to perform than the Miranda custody one.

24

you have also recognized that the court -­

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, at least it's the

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court performing it, not the interrogating officer, as

2

Justice Scalia's questions point out.

3

MS. BLACKMAN:

The police officer plays a

4

role in the voluntariness, also.

5

must be assessing whether the circumstances may be

6

giving rise to an involuntary confession.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

And the police officer

Age -­

What about mental

8

deficiency, if -- if age should be one of the factors,

9

deciding whether the individual regarded himself as in

10

custody or not, why shouldn't mental deficiency be so as

11

well?

12

I mean, once you do this, don't you, in effect, say that

13

it is a subjective inquiry whether the particular

14

individual regarded him or herself as being in custody;

15

isn't that the -- the basis of what you're arguing?

Is there any -- any basis in principle for not --

16

MS. BLACKMAN:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18
19

No.
No?

Why is age different

from mental deficiency, for example?
MS. BLACKMAN:

Age is different because,

20

number one, it involves restrictions on freedom of

21

movement, so the circumstances of the interrogation are

22

going to be understood and interpreted differently by a

23

child than it would be by an adult.

24

Secondly, we're talking about cognitive

25

differences which exist between children and adults

which affects their perception and understanding.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

You could say both of those

things about the mentally deficient.

4

themselves as -- as unfree to leave, and they have

5

cognitive deficiencies.
MS. BLACKMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Well, what about this test

11

which comes from three cases, the first being Berkemer,

12

the second Stansbury, and the third I'll tell you in a

13

second?

14

a reasonable person for this purpose and avoiding

15

subjective states of mind, you would look at objective

16

circumstances, known to both the officer and the suspect

17

that are likely relevant to the way a person would

18

understand his situation.

19

It is that those -- what are -- in considering

All right?

So both would be both mental illness and age

20

and -- I don't know, whether you speak English, and a

21

lot of other things would be relevant, provided they are

22

things that are relevant to how a person would

23

understand his situation and are known to both the

24

officer and the individual.

25

The third case, of course, is my dissent in

JUSTICE BREYER:

But nothing in the majority

4

conflicts with that, that I can see, except the holding.

5

I thought I lost the case, but apparently it's up again,

6

so I don't see why that isn't a perfectly good test.

7

But if you're not going to support it, then I've got no

8

support.
MS. BLACKMAN:

9

Well, we're simply making the

10

point that there's not necessarily going to be a

11

floodgate opening.

And we haven't seen that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

No, no, but I mean what

13

Justice Scalia was really asking is, do you favor

14

something like this test that I read, which is open as

15

to circumstance?

16

long as both policemen and the -- and the individual

17

know it and it is relevant as to how he understands the

18

circumstance, whether he's likely free to go or not.

Anything could fit in that blank, as

Thank you.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even -- even if you said

21
22

Conceptually absolutely.
Yes, that's

right.

23

no, you're pushing us there, because there's no basis

24

for treating a childhood any differently from these

25

other factors.

So basically you're saying Justice
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Breyer would call it objective circumstances.

You know,

2

whether you're mentally deficient, I would call that the

3

subjective condition of the -- of the person being held

in custody.

meant by the phrase "objective circumstances."

And I think, I don't think that's what we

10

factors, right?

Those are all objective circumstances?

MS. BLACKMAN:

11

Your Honor, what we are

talking about are a complex of characteristics which are

13

unique to children, and that's what we are examining in

But here it seems to me so rampant because this police

officer dealt only with juveniles, and he investigated

juveniles.
MS. BLACKMAN:

I agree completely.

officer was assigned the case because it had already

Yes.
The whole point of

the Miranda rule, I thought, was to provide clear,

objective guidelines about what the police are supposed

to do.

And it seems to me that one of the difficulties

10

with your rule, however clear it may seem in this case,

11

but it does have to apply more broadly, is that that's

12

off the table, and now they're not only going to have to

13

know, does this person understand it, but they're going

to have to know, it's not every one of these situations

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. BLACKMAN:

It doesn't change the rule

2

itself.

I mean, the rule itself remains:

All objective

3

circumstances relevant to the custody determination must

4

be considered.
What it's doing is taking this out of the

5
6

reasonable adult standard, which by default is the only

7

one, then, that can be used, and so it's not going to be

8

muddying the waters in the sense that it is something

9

needed in order to promote accurate fact-finding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

Would it be -- is it

11

enough if the officers in this situation said, look,

12

you're free to leave, you know, whenever you want,

13

but -- and then goes on -- or do they have to think -­

14

now, maybe -- maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't think

15

that's true, or maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't feel

16

that he can leave if he's got the vice principal there

17

and they want to talk.
MS. BLACKMAN:

18

I mean, that is an objective

19

circumstance that occurs in the course of an

20

interrogation which is very weighty in determining if

21

custody occurs.

Here -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

I'm thinking it

23

would not even be enough if they told the 13-year-old,

24

questions.

And the principal is there, and he thinks,

well, you know -- maybe the 13-year-old is thinking,

2

maybe I'm going to get in trouble if I leave.
MS. BLACKMAN:

3

It involves all of the

4

circumstances which are arising during the course of

5

these interrogations, but certainly advising someone

that they are free to leave and advising them that they

MS. BLACKMAN:

But that is an additional

2

reason why police officers need to be aware of what the

3

age is of a child that they are interrogating because of

4

independent obligations arising out of State statutes.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is your answer to

6

Justice Ginsburg that, no, the fact that a parent was

7

not notified is not relevant to the Miranda question?

8

It may be relevant to the voluntariness question.

9
10
11

MS. BLACKMAN:

No, I believe it remains

relevant to the Miranda question, because -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question really is if

he is in custody.

And maybe there's something different

13

about being in the room with a juvenile police

14

investigator and the assistant principal and being in

15

that same room with your parents there.

16

MS. BLACKMAN:

That is correct.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, so it's not just

18

that they have to call the parent; they have to wait for

19

the parent to show up?

20

MS. BLACKMAN:

Because of State statutory

MS. BLACKMAN:

I understand that, but I'm

just explaining that independent bases may arise for

that, we're not imposing additional burdens.

These are

things that police officers have to be considering.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the age of the

person being questioned is unclear?
MS. BLACKMAN:

If the interrogation is

10

occurring under circumstances where the officer should

11

have known, then I think the burden remains with the

12

officer to consider this, and that could arise from -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose -- suppose the

14

person shows an ID and it shows the person is 19 years

15

old, and the officer looks at him and says, he looks

like a pretty young 19-year-old?

17

MS. BLACKMAN:

If there is no way to verify

18

the information that the child is giving, then the

19

officer accepts the ID as being the age of the person he

20

is interrogating.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if -- I mean, under my

MS. BLACKMAN:

The officer has to proceed on

the basis of his observations.

I mean, objective

8

circumstances are things that are readily apparent.

9

There can be circumstances which tell the officer that,

10

in fact, he is dealing with a child, either the setting,

the appearance, the contact of parents, and so on.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MS. BLACKMAN:

Is there a good faith -­
But if there -- if there is

that this is a child, if he has no reason to know, then

not apply.

The way you phrase the

Did you really mean "may," so it's

discretionary with each judge, whether a juvenile's age

is relevant to the in-custody analysis?
MS. BLACKMAN:

No, it is must.

As with any

objective circumstance, the court has to take it into

it's important to know that we have already started

3

going down the slippery slope in a number of states.

4

There have been 11 states, contrary to Petitioner's

5

brief, that are considering other characteristics in

6

Miranda, such as sophistication, such as education, such

7

as intelligence.

That makes it so much more difficult.

And this Court has not hesitated -- it did

not hesitate in Alvarado; it did not hesitate in

Berkemer -- to correct lower courts, to say we've got to

make sure that Miranda is complete, that Miranda stays

clear and objective, and that we don't blur the lines.
JUSTICE ALITO:

13

If the law goes down that

route, then one of the chief advantages of the Miranda

rule, which is that it's a relatively simple objective

test, is eliminated, and the law of Miranda begins to

resemble the law of voluntariness.

I think that's a relatively small and not a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's all we're doing

2

with the young person.

And in fact, most of us, many of

3

us, have a great deal more experience understanding the

4

world through the eyes of a young person or children,

5

perhaps, than understanding the eyes -- the world

6

through the eyes of a severely sensory deprived person.
We're asking the exact same thing in both

7
8

contexts:

9

do the objective circumstances appear to a person in

10
11

What is this person -- what is this -- what

this situation?
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

12

you're doing the same thing, and I think it's easier to

13

put yourself in the mindset of a person with a sensory

14

deprivation than a person of a particular age, and let

15

me explain why.

16

For a person with a sensory deprivation,

17

like in Justice Breyer's example, the sign that someone

18

can't read, I think it's very common and easy for

19

officers and courts to figure out how they would react

20

to the situation if the sign simply weren't there.

21

With age, what you're asking perhaps a

22

45-year-old officer to do, in Justice Alito's example,

23

or a 60-year-old judge to do, is to put them into the

24

frame of mind of a person that they haven't been for 32

25

years or 45 years, and I don't think that's a very easy
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

inquiry to ask officers or courts to make.
I think this is really going to complicate

2
3

the Miranda rule by asking them, A, to do that, and, B,

4

because there are going to be many cases, unlike this

5

case, where it's not going to be apparent to the officer

6

what age the suspect is.
One thing that comes up fairly commonly in

7
8

many jurisdictions is that an officer will stop someone

9

on a -- do a traffic stop of someone on the road; the

10

person will claim not to have their ID, and it will turn

out the person is 14 and they will give the name and

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are sort of two parts to your question.

Let me deal

2

first with the rule that would only apply when officers

3

know the identity, know the age of the suspect.

4

that rule would be easier to apply than the rule the

5

Petitioners are suggesting and would mitigate some of

6

the damage, but first of all it doesn't solve the

7

critical problem of asking officers who aren't

8

themselves 13 to think like someone who is 13; and

9

second of all, I think for reasons that I think were

I think

10

apparent during the argument by my friend on the other

11

side, that rule might easily devolve into a "should have

12

known" test, and officers simply aren't going to be able

13

to deal with that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

The officer doesn't have to

15

think like a 13-year-old, he has to think the way a

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, I may have

5

difficulty dealing with this particular hypothetical

6

because of my lack of knowledge of the particular

7

symptoms of Down's syndrome; but if you're dealing with

8

a suspect who simply can't absorb information about the

9

world, then that's going to be a sensory deprivation

10

that's going to be taken into account, because it's

11

going to subtract circumstances away that that suspect

12

can't perceive.

13

of someone that has a particular sensory disability,

14

then no, I don't think that would be taken into account

15

because it's asking too much of officers to try to put

16

themselves in that mindset.

17

But if you're asking about the mindset

And the third problem, I think, with

18

factoring age into the custody test is that -- and as I

slippery slope problem.

disorders or cultural background, that defendants also

Apparently the people who

25

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, one reason they may think
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's a good thing and one reason I think the Court

2

doesn't need to accept Petitioner's rule here, is that

3

officers often will give Miranda warnings, for precisely

4

the reasons Justice Sotomayor was suggesting earlier,

5

which is that when officers do give Miranda warnings,

6

it's going to be -- and those Miranda -- the Miranda

7

procedures are all validly followed, there's not going

8

to be a real robust voluntariness inquiry because in

9

most cases where the Miranda procedures are followed,

10

the statements are going to be found to be voluntary

11

under the voluntariness test.
And if I could actually add answer an answer

to Justice Scalia's earlier question, Miranda isn't

being taken into account by Officer DiCostanzo, and

circumstances of the case; and without this

consideration of age, then the courts are examining

hypothetical, because -- hypothetical interrogations and

14

Officers have to make judgments about every

objective circumstance that arises, and asking them to

different and is not going to muddy the water.

as Justice Kagan pointed out, custody is a very
