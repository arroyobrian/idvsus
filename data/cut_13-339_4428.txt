 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN J. MURRAY 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

8

 MR. MURRAY: 

9

please the Court: 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 CTS should prevail here based on the text of 

11

Section 9658 as well as its structure, historical 

12

context, and other relevant considerations, all of which 

13

make clear that it is a federalism comprise having no 

14

effects on statutes of repose. 

15

 Section 9658 should be construed narrowly to 

16

do the one thing that Congress intended it to do, which 

17

is to postpone in some situations a single State law 

18

statute of limitations commencement date. We stand

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How many  how many 

20

States have  this is  this is a general statute of 

21

repose and nothing to do in particular with CERCLA; is 

22

that right? 

23

 MR. MURRAY: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

That's right. 
And how many States have such 

statutes?

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MURRAY: 

Well, it gets a little 

2

confusing.  The study group report indicated there were 

3

four of those States.  I believe Respondents have 

4

pointed to four or five.  There are also  that have to 

5

do with personal injury.  There are also myriad others 

6

that have to do with property damage.  So it gets a 

7

little confusing to give a strict answer to that.  But 

8

there were four statutes of repose squarely in the study 

9

group before  before Congress when they enacted this. 

10

So Congress knew about these statutes of repose when 

11

they enacted this. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if you were to 

13

prevail, then the parties concerned might well go to 

14

their State legislatures and say, enact a statute of 

15

repose.  That will get us off the hook, even before the 

16

injured person is aware of the injury and of the cause 

17

of it.  The result of that would be to totally defeat 

18

what Congress meant to do in saying the trigger is when 

19

you know the cause of the injury. 

20

 MR. MURRAY: 

There has not been a rash of 

21

move to State legislatures since this law has been 

22

enacted, so we haven't seen that develop.  But if I 

23

could respectfully disagree with the premise.  I think 

24

Congress's purpose here was slightly narrower than 

25

saving all longlatent injury claims.  I think what

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress was worried about was expedition and making 

2

sure that it didn't force people to come to court 

3

before  under a statute of limitations before they 

4

would be expected to. 

5

 And that's set out  the statute itself 

6

accomplishes only one thing, Section (a)(1), and I'm 

7

reading from page 1 of our opening brief to the Court. 

8

"It does one thing only, which is if the applicable 

9

limitations period for one of these actions as specified 

10

in a State law statute of limitations or under common 

11

law provides a commencement date that's earlier than the 

12

Federal commencement date, then it substitutes the more 

13

favorable commencement date." 

14

 Commencement date, in turn, if we turn to 

15

page 2  and this is reading now from (b)(3) 

16

"Commencement date means the date specified in a statute 

17

of limitations as beginning of the applicable 

18

limitations period," which again, (b)(2), applicable 

19

limitations period is defined as the period specified in 

20

a statute of limitations during which one of these civil 

21

actions may be brought. 

22

 So doing the algebra on the definitions, 

23

what Congress surgically wanted to do here was to change 

24

one thing and one thing only.  If you had a less 

25

favorable State commencement date, which is the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

beginning of which an action may be brought, which is 

2

accrual, if you have one of these less favorable State 

3

commencement dates for statute of limitations, Congress 

4

wanted to move that, keeping in place 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Why would it have wanted to 

6

do that and not also get rid of the statute of repose? 

7

I mean, presumably the idea is you should have some 

8

chance to sue after you've discovered the injury and the 

9

cause of the injury.  And if here, the statute of repose 

10

is preventing that, why would Congress have wanted to 

11

modify a statute of limitations but not get rid of the 

12

statute of repose? 

13

 MR. MURRAY: 

I think Congress was trying to 

14

be very careful with what it was doing in this area 

15

because it knew it was operating in pretty much the 

16

heartland of State law and State prerogatives here. 

17

 And so while it was willing to go as far as 

18

the one study group recommendation and change statutes 

19

of limitations, a procedural mechanism, it wasn't 

20

willing to go right into the heart of the elements of 

21

the cause of action and start changing those because it 

22

perceived potentially serious federalism problems with 

23

doing that. 

24

 It would be akin to Congress passing a law 

25

that says rather than  since these  negligence is

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what's at issue here.  Rather than negligence, Congress 

2

passing a law saying the duty of care will be strict 

3

liability.  I think there are serious constitutional 

4

problems with that as we've set out.  And so Congress 

5

was very careful to tread lightly here and preserve the 

6

prerogatives of the States to keep in place the statute 

7

of 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What would be the 

9

constitutional problem if Congress had said all people 

10

claiming an injury under this statute can commence the 

11

action three years after discovery of the cause, to say 

12

that? 

13

 MR. MURRAY: 

To the extent that's a statute 

14

of limitations period, it's not a problem.  But to the 

15

extent it were to affect a statute of repose, North 

16

Carolina law is very clear that statutes of repose are 

17

an element of the cause of action.  In other words, 

18

unless you plead and prove this element of the North 

19

Carolina law cause of action, you're out of court. 

20

 Had Congress gone so far as to remove an 

21

element, I think you're in dangerous constitutional 

22

territory.  But 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What kind of  I don't 

24

follow that.  A statute of repose is a time limitation; 

25

is that right?

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MURRAY: 

It is.  But a statute of repose 

2

is designed to accomplish something  it's going after 

3

very different objectives than Congress was after with 

4

statutes of limitations.  Statutes of limitations, of 

5

course, as this statute reflects, are designed 

6

they're about diligence.  They're about making sure that 

7

people don't sleep on their rights. 

8
9

 And so what Congress did here was it left in 
place State law as it found it, including the 

10

limitations period, the time period itself, and all it 

11

did was make one slight modification for those who might 

12

not have thought to be able to be as diligent as others 

13

and moved that date to a more favorable Federal 

14

commencement date. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Suppose  suppose a State 

16

has  most of these statutes of repose are piggybacked 

17

on top of statutes of limitation, right?  I mean, you 

18

know, you have to sue within 10 years after  after you 

19

find  you find the injury.  But in any case, a suit 

20

must be brought within  within 20 years after  after 

21

the act.  That's the basis of your suit, right?  But 

22

let's assume you  you have a State which only has a 

23

statute of  of repose.  It just says any suit for 

24

for this act of negligence must be brought within 10 

25

years after the act occurred.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Is that still a statute of repose? 

It seems 

2

to me then that would meet your  your definition of 

3

of the commencement time for suit, would have to be 

4

when  when the act occurred, and then you have 10 

5

years from that. 

6

 MR. MURRAY: 

A statute written in that sort 

7

of way which gives permission, which is exactly what 

8

Congress was focused on, might well be a statute of 

9

limitation.  It doesn't sound like a statute of repose 

10

because, again, what Congress wanted to move was the 

11

beginning of the period in which 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But that's the beginning. 

13

It doesn't give permission.  It just says, you know, 

14

you're liable for negligence of  in this  in this 

15

area, but any suit must be brought within 10 years after 

16

the act occurred. 

17

 MR. MURRAY: 

To the extent that a statute 

18

was that, and the State had only a statute of repose, 

19

then we don't believe 9658 would touch that at all.  And 

20

that makes sense because what Congress was doing was 

21

taking State law as it found it  and there's no 

22

obligation for States to have these causes of action at 

23

all.  States could repeal these causes of action, and 

24

there would be no right to sue.  States could change 

25

their statutes of limitations to a day after accrual,

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and that would be fine, too. 

2

 All Congress did was move the date on which 

3

a statute of limitations begins to run till a later 

4

date. 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Murray, in Justice 

6

Scalia's example, what in the text would prevent you 

7

from treating that  the single statute, which is 

8

written as a statute of repose, what in the text is 

9

preventing you from saying that the statute applies to 

10
11

it? 
 MR. MURRAY: 

Yes, Your Honor.  (B)(2) and 

12

(B)(3) read together, we believe, are the two pieces 

13

that would be most relevant.  What Congress has chosen 

14

to move is the commencement date when State law is less 

15

favorable than Federal.  Commencement date is defined as 

16

the beginning of the applicable limitations period.  And 

17

applicable limitations period means a period in a 

18

statute of limitations when suit may be brought. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

20

 MR. MURRAY: 

Right. 
A suit under North Carolina law 

21

may not be brought just because a defendant has made an 

22

act or omission.  Indeed, under North Carolina law, a 

23

suit may not be brought until an action accrues.  That's 

24

set out in 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I think you're  you're

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

messing with the hypothetical now.  I mean, assume that 

2

the statute of repose is all there is.  Now, in fact, 

3

you're not going to get any suits because nobody is 

4

going to know that they're injured until they know that 

5

they're injured.  But why wouldn't that be the 

6

commencement date is the thing that triggers the statute 

7

of repose, the last act or omission, and  and the 

8

applicable limitations period is the 10 years? 

9

 MR. MURRAY: 

If we were in a State where you 

10

were permitted to sue  permission to sue was given 

11

based on the last act or omission of a defendant, then 

12

we would be in a different situation, but here 

13

permission to sue does not arise until your cause of 

14

action accrues.  There's a distinction between the last 

15

act and omission of a defendant, which is what starts 

16

the running of the statutes of repose, on the one hand, 

17

and the accrual of a cause of action. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but my hypothetical 

19

was different.  There  there is no such distinction. 

20

There is no statute of limitations.  It's only what you 

21

call a statute of repose.  And I think you have to say 

22

that in that situation, it is no longer a statute of 

23

repose, that it's a statute of limitations. 

24
25

 MR. MURRAY: 

Again, so long as we're reading 

9658 to apply to and only to, it can apply when and only

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

when there is a less favorable State law commencement 

2

date.  If the State law, as you are positing it, it 

3

might well be a statute of limitations.  If the State 

4

law, as you're positing it, allows someone to bring a 

5

cause of action, that starts to sound like a cause 

6

of  like a statute of limitations.  Here, the statute 

7

of repose is in no way tied to anything having to do 

8

with the plaintiff.  It is an end date which begins with 

9

defendant's last act or omission and ends 10 years later 

10

and is the end of the cause of action.  None of that is 

11

the beginning of an applicable limitations period, the 

12

beginning of when someone may bring a suit, when suit 

13

has accrued, in other words, under North Carolina law as 

14

we think 9658 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

enacted?  What was it? 

17

 MR. MURRAY: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MR. MURRAY: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

When was this statute 

1986. 
'86.  I thoughtOkay. 
It was not part of the 
To tell you the truth, I've 

21

never heard of this distinction between statutes of 

22

repose and statutes of limitations. 

23

 MR. MURRAY: 

Right.  Well, and there  but 

24

to be clear, Congress hasn't always been perfectly clear 

25

and certainly some of this Court's decision as with

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jurisdiction and standing have made some loose use of the 

2

language.  But Congress certainly has written into 

3

various laws, some of which have been presented in the 

4

amicus briefs here, backend, hardend dates after which 

5

causes of action may not be brought.  And all 

6

Congress 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, yes.  But have they 

8

ever  have they ever drawn a distinction between 

9

statutes of limitations and statutes of repose?  Is 

10

there any Federal statute that makes that distinction 

11

or  or is there any Federal statute which applies only 

12

to statutes of repose? 

13

 MR. MURRAY: 

There's no Federal statute that 

14

makes the distinction between limitations and repose, 

15

but there are  as we  have been set out here, many 

16

Federal statutes that give this hardend, backend 

17

protection to defendants and for important reasons, 

18

right?  Remember that these statutes 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh yeah.  It exists.  I 

20

mean, these statutes exist, but  but are they called 

21

statutes of repose?  Or are they  are they not 

22

considered, as I used to consider them when I was in law 

23

school and even as late as 1986, I  I would have 

24

considered that a statutes of limitations.  Now, you 

25

think Congress is smarter.  They  they know the law

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

better. 
 MR. MURRAY: 

We think Congress understood 

3

the distinction, and this is a harder question to 

4

answer, but for those who find resort to legislative 

5

history helpful here, remember what Congress did in 

6

1980, they passed CERCLA and then they commissioned 

7

which was not about torts at all.  CERCLA is a broad 

8

cleanup statute focused on, you know, without fault, 

9

without liability, cleaning up land. 

10

 It then commissioned a study group of 

11

leading folks to get together and figure out whether 

12

there should be a tort cause of action, whether there 

13

should be other changes made to the law, what else 

14

should be done in the tort arena.  And that study group 

15

report was very clear on the distinction between 

16

statutes of repose, on the one hand, and statutes of 

17

limitations on the other.  And that's what Congress 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but in general, 

19

Mr. Murray, I think Justice Scalia is right, that, in 

20

general, Congress hasn't made this distinction.  In 

21

general, this Court has not made this distinction.  In 

22

general, I think this goes back to  to Justice 

23

Ginsburg's point.  The purpose behind this law, clearly, 

24

it doesn't matter either  I mean, either way.  If 

25

Congress wanted to make sure that people could sue after

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discovering their injury, a statute of repose prevents 

2

that, as well as a statute of limitations does. 

3

 And yet you are asking us to imagine a 

4

Congress that has this very much in  in its head, both 

5

the difference between these two things, and you said 

6

the reason that they wanted only to alter the one and 

7

not to alter the other is because they thought of the 

8

statute of repose as impinging on a State's 

9

constitutional prerogatives.  Now, that's a very legally 

10

sophisticated Congress you're asking us to imagine. 

11

 (Laughter.) 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You know, to understand this 

13

distinction and then to say, oh, yes, look, the statute 

14

of repose is really an interference with substantive 

15

liability in a way that the statute of limitations is 

16

not and that might raise constitutional avoidance 

17

issues.  I mean, I think that's  that's  that's 

18

pretty sophisticated stuff. 

19

 MR. MURRAY: 

Two points, Your Honor.  One, 

20

actually Congress, at least at this time, was very 

21

sophisticated, and we've set out, again 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 MR. MURRAY: 

For those who find legislative 

24

history to be helpful, we've set out several exchanges 

25

right on the floor between members of Congress where one

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would ask, what is the difference between a statute of 

2

limitations and repose?  Another would ask  thank you 

3

for asking, and explain it really quite succinctly.  So 

4

that at least at that time 

5
6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And everybody was listening 

to that.  The chamber was full and 

7

 (Laughter.) 

8

 MR. MURRAY: 

9

 But my second point is, we don't have to 

That was my first point. 

10

rest on the broad construction of statute of limitations 

11

versus statute of repose, sort of the broad definitional 

12

purpose.  I come back to the text and the structure of 

13

the statute here, which again, only does one thing, 

14

moving a commencement date defined as the beginning of 

15

the period in which one of these actions may be brought. 

16

That simply does not define a statute of repose. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought that what 

18

Congress was trying to do was to establish a Federally 

19

required commencement date, a Federal requirement  a 

20

Federally requirement commencement date.  So when you 

21

ask the question, how much time do I have to sue for one 

22

of these CERCLA injuries, the answer would be three 

23

years after you know the cause of your injury. 

24
25

 Now, on your  taking out this statute of 
repose, there can no longer be a uniform answer to that

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

question. 
 MR. MURRAY: 

That's absolutely right.  All 

3

Congress was  there's no uniform answer to that 

4

question because a statute of repose does not meet the 

5

definition Congress set out in the statute as the 

6

beginning of the period in which an action may be 

7

brought.  That is accrual.  And that speaks to statute 

8

of limitations.  The beginning of which an action may be 

9

brought has nothing to do, necessarily, with the last 

10

act or omission of the defendant, which is a statute of 

11

repose. 

12

 And again, it's a perfectly logical 

13

distinction for Congress to make, given what they were 

14

trying to do.  The  the statute itself makes clear 

15

that State law otherwise controls.  They didn't touch 

16

any other part of State law.  All they did was this 

17

narrow surgical strike at the beginning of statutes of 

18

limitations. 

19
20
21
22

 If I might reserve the rest of my time for 
rebuttal.

 SUPPORTING PETITIONER 
 MR. PALMORE: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 Section 9658 surgically modifies State law 

5

tort actions in one limited respect, and otherwise 

6

leaves them untouched, by changing the commencement date 

7

for the time period in which a civil action may be 

8

brought.  The relevant time period 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So, Mr. Palmore, if  if 

10

Congress  if all of the States enact this 10 

11

10year statute of repose, then that has totally 

12

undermined what Congress set about to do in 9658.

 MR. PALMORE: 

I respectfully disagree, 

14

Justice Ginsburg, because Congress had before it a 

15

report that identified the principal problem in this 

16

area as when statutes of limitations periods commenced. 

17

And it identified the problem as those  that minority 

18

of States that commenced this running of statute of 

19

limitations period at a time of injury as opposed to 

20

discovery of injury and its cause. 

21

 It's critical to understand here that there 

22

were only four States, as counsel said, at the time that 

23

Congress enacted this statute that had statutes of 

24

repose, and those were States that all had discovery 

25

rules.  There's no inconsistency between a statute of

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

repose and a statute of limitations with a discovery 

2

rule.  They typically go together, and they represent a 

3

compromise and a balancing of interest on the part of 

4

the States that makes enact  enacted a, in a sense, a 

5

proplaintiff reform to adopt a discovery rule, but 

6

provided for defendants the certainty of a substantive 

7

cutoff at an outer range.  Those two things go together. 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But, Mr. Palmore, the 

question I asked is suppose all of the States have these 

10

10year statutes of repose.  Then there would be no 

11

occasion to invoke 9658, and the plaintiff would be out 

12

of court before the action accrued in some cases. 

13

 MR. PALMORE: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I just 

14

need you to hypothesize a State that had  didn't have 

15

a discovery rule and for some reason had  additionally 

16

had a statute of repose.  I'm not sure why a State would 

17

do that.  The Federal statute would still work in that 

18

setting, but that wasn't the record before Congress.  As 

19

I said before, there were only four States who had 

20

statutes of repose.  There's no indication in the text 

21

or the legislative history that that was a focus of 

22

Congress's attention. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Are you acknowledging that 

24

if a State had only a socalled statute of repose, 

25

that  that the Federal limitation would apply to that?

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It's only a statute of  of repose piggybacked on what 

2

we've been calling a statute of limitations.  It's only 

3

that one that survives. 

4

 MR. PALMORE: 

I think  Justice Scalia, I 

5

think you have to look at the text and structure of the 

6

State law and see what is the commencement date of the 

7

time period. 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

question yes  yes or no. 

10

 MR. PALMORE: 

I think you can answer the 

If they had only  so if 

11

North Carolina didn't have a threeyear statute of 

12

limitations and only had this 10year statute of 

13

repose 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

 MR. PALMORE: 

Right. 
 I think our position would 

16

be the same, that Section 9658 would not apply.  I'm not 

17

aware of any State that has such  such a statute. 

18

There was no State mentioned in the study group 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's why you want to give 

it away. 
 MR. PALMORE: 

That  so I think the 

22

critical factor, as Mr. Murray said, was the 

23

definitions  the nested definitions in this statute of 

24

the beginning of the applicable limitations period, and 

25

the applicable limitations period is the period

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

specified during which a civil action may be brought. 

2

When can you first go into court with a complete cause 

3

of action and file a complaint? 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  You have a statute to 

5

say there is  there is a cause of action for X, okay, 

6

and a separate statute  there exists a cause of action 

7

for X.  And a separate statute which says any  any 

8

suit for X cannot be brought after 10 years from the act 

9

of the defendant that is the basis for the claim.  Okay? 

10

Why  why isn't that the commencement date on which you 

11

can bring suit where  where the act occurs. 

12

 MR. PALMORE: 

I think it depends on whether 

13

under State law you have a complete cause of action and 

14

can go into court, file a complaint and get relief.  And 

15

I don't think we have to ask in the abstract, because if 

16

you look at page 3(A) of the government's brief, the 

17

appendix to the government's brief, you see what North 

18

Carolina law answers this question.  It says, "Civil 

19

actions can only be commenced," it actually uses the 

20

same word, "within the periods prescribed in this 

21

chapter after the cause of action has accrued." 

22

 So in North Carolina, as is typical of every 

23

State that I'm familiar with, you  the statute of 

24

limitations period begins to run when you have an 

25

accrued cause of action.  Now, North Carolina has

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adopted  had actually adopted a discovery rule.  So 

2

Section 9658 doesn't have any  any purchase in this 

3

case because the  the commencement date of the statute 

4

of limitations period is the same.  But I think there 

5

are serious problems 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I think what  at least 

7

what I take from Justice Scalia's question is that if 

8

you think of the  if you imagine  and you're quite 

9

right that this doesn't exist in the real world  but 

10

if you imagine a statute of repose existing 

11

independently, it actually would fit the language of 

12

this statute quite, you know, fine.  The commencement 

13

date would be different.  It would not be the date of 

14

accrual.  It would be the date of the defendant's last 

15

act, but still the statute would work perfectly well. 

16

And I suppose if you think that, then  then in a case 

17

in which there was both, the question would be why 

18

wouldn't you just apply this statute to both? 

19

 MR. PALMORE: 

Well, I'd like to go to that 

20

question because I think that  that goes to the  the 

21

rather strained reading of the statute that Respondents 

22

advance.  So Respondents suggest that when (a)(1) talks 

23

about a comparison between a Federal commencement date 

24

and the applicable limitations period under State law, 

25

Congress would have contemplated that there would be a

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

comparison to multiple limitations periods under State 

2

law. 

3

 Furthermore, it assumes that the solution 

4

that Congress would have arrived at to an issue with 

5

statutes of repose was to have a statute of repose 

6

period start with a discovery rule, which would be a 

7

creature unknown to the law.  And third, they assumed 

8

that what Congress did here was contemplate that in a 

9

State like North Carolina that had two different time 

10

limitation periods of two different lengths, that 

11

Congress's solution was to require a common starting 

12

point for both rendering the longer limitations period 

13

strangely superfluous. 

14

 If Congress would have gone about this in a 

15

much more straightforward way if it had wanted to accept 

16

the study group's suggestion that it repeal  or the 

17

suggestion was actually directed to the States  that 

18

the States repeal statutes of repose, Congress would 

19

have done so expressly.  It wouldn't have done so by 

20

awkwardly layering a discovery rule on top of statutes 

21

of repose. 

22

 And, Justice Scalia, this distinction 

23

between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, 

24

we agree it's not the label that controls.  We think 

25

Congress here showed by the way the definitions and the

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

way this provision works what it had in mind when it 

2

talked about statutes of limitations, but the  the 

3

substantive difference between the two is something that 

4

both this Court's cases and the  and the law generally 

5

recognized.  The  the North Carolina cases that we 

6

cite in our brief and the Petitioners cite Black and 

7

Boudreau, in particular, are quite clear in 

8

distinguishing between the two. 

9

 This Court in Lampf, when talking about the 

10

oneyear, threeyear limitations period under the 

11

securities laws distinguished between the two and said 

12

there would be no equitable tolling applied to the 

13

period of repose, the threeyear limit in the securities 

14

laws.  That didn't turn on the label, that turned on the 

15

substance of how these things work. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes.  It didn't turn on 

17

the label in part because  I was looking at the 

18

opinion  it talks about a statute of limitations.  So 

19

that  that helps the other side, although the repose 

20

period helps you. 

21

 MR. PALMORE: 

That's right.  Justice 

22

Kennedy, it's not a question of labels.  It's a question 

23

of the definitions in this statute and how this statute 

24

actually works.  We agree the labels aren't dispositive. 

25

 And as we've discussed in our brief, Justice

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Scalia, conflict of laws is another area in which 

2

the courts consistently draw a distinction between 

3

statutes of limitations, which they classify as 

4

procedural, and thus the forum State can apply its own 

5

statute of limitations law, and statutes of repose, 

6

which the courts 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Does  does the 

8

restatement court statute of repose, are they going back 

9

to what  at least I learned in law school, there was a 

10

statute of limitations and then there was a socalled 

11

builtin statute of limitations.  Statute of limitations 

12

general covered all claims, but a builtin statute of 

13

limitations was considered to limit not simply the 

14

remedy, but the right. 

15

 MR. PALMORE: 

That is the distinction that 

16

the North Carolina cases draw.  Sometimes it can be 

17

specific to a statutory cause of action, sometimes it 

18

can be generally applicable.  The policy consideration 

19

behind a statute of repose is related but distinct from 

20

a statute of limitations, which is about incentivizing a 

21

plaintiff to get into court quickly.  The statute of 

22

repose is intended to provide certainty at the back end 

23

to a defendant so it can order its affairs, have 

24

insurance policies that make sense. 

25

 And that statute of repose, as an element of

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

substantive State law, will go with that defendant if 

2

it's sued in any other State where there might be venue 

3

or personal jurisdiction.  As a substantive matter of 

4

North Carolina law, that statute of repose will follow. 

5

 So this is a distinction that the law has 

6

generally recognized and it wouldn't be at all 

7

surprising that in the context of a federalism 

8

compromise, which is what 9658 really was, that Congress 

9

would have chosen to mirror that same distinction.  It 

10

would have decided to go after the principal problem 

11

that was before it, which was an issue of discovery 

12

rules, the absence of discovery rules in certain States, 

13

without more deeply intruding into the substance of 

14

State law.  These are State law tort actions.  They're 

15

quintessentially within the responsibility and the 

16

sovereignty of the States. 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Palmore, what do you 

think the commencement date in this case was? 
 MR. PALMORE: 

The commencement date in this 

20

case, I think, was probably in 2009, when, under both 

21

North Carolina law and the Federal commencement date, 

22

when these Respondents learned from the EPA that their 

23

well water was contaminated.  Because at that time, they 

24

both discovered their injury and they understood the 

25

cause, so 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But how could that be the 

2

beginning of the period during which his suit may be 

3

brought?  I mean, he couldn't bring suit on that date. 

4

 MR. PALMORE: 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

6
7

Well, we think the best way 
It seems something sort of 

internally contradictory in your interpretation here. 
 MR. PALMORE: 

We think there are two ways of 

8

looking at it and either way the Petitioner is correct. 

9

One is you look at just the statute of limitations 

10

period, which is the applicable limitations period for 

11

purposes of the statute.  So that 2009 would be the 

12

commencement date there, even if there might be a 

13

separate barrier to relief.  But second, even if you say 

14

there is no commencement date under State law, then 

15

under (a)(1), there is no commencement date under State 

16

law a fortiori that had  that was earlier than the 

17

Federal commencement date.  So you end up at the same 

18

place.

 Mr. Korzen.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. KORZEN 

22

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

23

 MR. KORZEN: 

24

please the Court: 

25

Thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 I'd like to start with the plain wording of

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

9658, but first just say a sentence or two about the 

2

purpose.  The purpose of Section 9658 is to preserve 

3

claims for latent harm from environmental releases, from 

4

a facility of hazardous waste, until the person 

5

discovers the cause of that latent harm.  And latent 

6

harm, which is all over the legislative history, but 

7

which neither of my friends for the Petitioners 

8

mentioned, latent harm is what this statute was preserved passed 

9

for.  And latent harm includes things such as the 

10

groundwater contamination in this case, or cancer such 

11

as in the Camp Lejeune case. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, and the whole 

13

purpose of a statute of repose is  is very different. 

14

That's to give you a drop, you know, completely finish 

15

date, so whatever was  was latent or not latent, it's 

16

over with.  It's a different purpose than a statute of 

17

limitations. 

18

 MR. KORZEN: 

Yes, Your Honor.  But Congress 

19

was concerned about preserving claims.  And it had one 

20

purpose here, I agree it had one purpose, but the one 

21

purpose of 9658 was to give a uniform trigger date for 

22

everybody to have the time to bring a claim, start to 

23

run, only after they discovered their harm.  And that is 

24

cut off by a statute of repose just as it would be  by 

25

a repose period just as it would be by any other

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

limitation. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I think there's 

3

there's merit to your argument.  But the point is that 

4

there is no cause of action if there's a repose period 

5

and  and that suit is commenced later.  And the study 

6

commission did recognize this distinction between 

7

limitations and repose.  I agree with Justice Scalia.  I 

8

didn't have Justice Ginsburg's law professor, but I 

9

 this was new for me. 

10

 (Laughter.) 

11

 MR. KORZEN: 

Your Honor, it was new.  If I 

12

could circle back to the study group in just a minute. 

13

In fact 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Other than it was 

mentioned in Lampf, but in a confusing way. 
 MR. KORZEN: 

Agreed.  And I would also like 

17

to circle back to Lampf.  But first, Petitioner's own 

18

brief on page 32 says that this was a newly emerging 

19

technologicalterminological distinction, a newly emerging 

20

terminological distinction as of 1986. 

21

 And to return back to one of Justice Kagan's 

22

questions, it expects an awful lot for Congress to have 

23

been aware of that and  and made this distinction that 

24

it's not even made to this day in 2014. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It was aware of it

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because the study group used the two terms and they knew 

2

there were two different statutes because they were 

3

told. 

4

 Now, how you make assumptions, I'm assuming 

5

that if there's a report, as there was with this, that 

6

people would be responding to it in the legislation 

7

that's being drafted. 

8

 MR. KORZEN: 

9

Yes, Your Honor.  Yes, Justice 

Sotomayor.  Let me  let me talk about that distinction 

10

for just a minute.  The study group report, and it's a 

11

very impressive work, about 700 pages long  one time, 

12

one time does it use the term "statutes of repose."  And 

13

in that one use, it's within the heading of statute of 

14

limitations.  And what the study group said is that in a 

15

handful of States, statutes of repose have the same 

16

effect of statute of limitations without a discovery 

17

rule as barring people's claims before they know they've 

18

been harmed.  And it said nothing about one is 

19

substantive, one is procedural.  It just said they have 

20

the same effect. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And therefore  and 

22

therefore it should be repealed, not and therefore 

23

should be covered by the Federal statute. 

24
25

 MR. KORZEN: 

Both recommendations, Justice 

Scalia, both recommendations  and this is crucial 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

both recommendations in the study group report were 

2

directed at the States.  It said States should adopt 

3

discovery rules and States should repeal statutes of 

4

repose. 

5
6
7

 Congress didn't wait on either of those. 
Congress 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Anyway, as the government 

8

argued, it doesn't matter.  It's not a matter of 

9

terminology.  It's a matter of reality.  It's a matter 

10

that these two things, whether they were given different 

11

names in 1986 or not, are quite different things.  And 

12

do you  do you deny that they are quite different 

13

things, and that therefore the statute may apply quite 

14

differently? 

15

 MR. KORZEN: 

I do, Your Honor.  I do deny 

16

that they are quite different.  They have at core the 

17

same basic similarity of defining a period when an 

18

action may be brought, and that's the language used in 

19

the secondary authorities of the day and used by 

20

Congress.  They both define periods when an action may 

21

be brought. 

22

 Now, there are some distinctions that again 

23

have emerged more clearly in some lower courts since 

24

1986, but they have at bottom, even to this day, the 

25

fact that they are both periods when an action may be

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

brought. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, why would 

3

you  why would these four States have two of them 

4

then?  I mean, if they are doing the same thing, why 

5

have two different ones? 

6

 MR. KORZEN: 

The States that have those, 

7

Your Honor, don't even classify them as statutes of 

8

repose.  In fact, the North Carolina one here, and you 

9

can see it on page 3 of the red brief, it's not in the 

10

blue brief  but the North Carolina statute, what we're 

11

talking about is one sentence out of paragraph 16 in a 

12

statute of limitations 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But it  but it's an 

14

important difference because in the States that have 

15

repose statutes there can be no tolling.  I mean that's 

16

huge; a minor, an incompetent person can't sue. 

17

 MR. KORZEN: 

That is a difference, Your 

18

Honor, but it's not a difference that was significant to 

19

Congress.  Congress was trying to preserve claims for 

20

people of latent harm 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I'm saying that repose 

22

statutes, when they exist, impose substantial hardships 

23

on people that the State otherwise protects, minors and 

24

incompetents.  They are out of luck. 

25

 MR. KORZEN: 

Well, in 9658 there is in fact

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provisions for minors and incompetents, and so statutes 

2

of limitations typically have those, but yet they are 

3

included in 9658. 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

5

Statutes of repose do not. 

6

 MR. KORZEN: 

That's the whole point. 

Which suggests 9658 had 

7

statutes of repose in mind.  There would be no need to 

8

protect minors for a statutes of limitations where there 

9

is equitable tolling. 

10

 But putting aside tolling 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I think  no, I 

12

think we all concede that what we're talking about here 

13

is a statute of limitation.  We're not saying it's also 

14

a statute of  everyone can see that there is a statute 

15

of limitations here.  The Federal law is a statute of 

16

limitation and so it protects minors. 

17

 But the question is whether or not this 

18

other statute of repose supersedes it.  So you can't look

19

you can't quote us to the  to the minors part of the 

20

statute and say that it isn't  because that doesn't 

21

address the point.  You still have the general equitable 

22

point that, that the position of the Petitioner might 

23

frustrate Congress's intent. 

24
25

 MR. KORZEN: 

Well, putting aside minors, 

Your Honors, the plain language here applies to any type

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of period.  Whether you call it a limitations period or 

2

a repose period, the plain language applies here. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you  is your 

4

understanding of the operation of this statute is the 

5

applicable limitations period  do you see the statute 

6

as applying seriatim first to the statute of limitations 

7

and then to the statute of repose, or is the applicable 

8

limitations period the period that you can sue when you 

9

combine those two? 

10
11

 MR. KORZEN: 

It  in most States, you just 

have one period, so in this State 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

13

 MR. KORZEN: 

No, here. 
Yes, here we have a hybrid 

14

statute of limitations.  That's what it's been called. 

15

It's also been called a bifurcated statute of 

16

limitations.  It's also been called a twotiered statute 

17

of limitations. 

18
19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, I just want to know how 

do you apply this statute to what we have here? 

20

 MR. KORZEN: 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
Is there a single applicable 

22

limitations period which represents the period when, 

23

given both clauses, you can sue, or are you saying that 

24

there are two applicable limitations periods? 

25

 MR. KORZEN: 

In this statute,two, and in a

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

small number of other States, there are two periods, 

2

both a 3year period and a 10year period. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, then you stumble into 

4

the difficulty that Petitioner pointed out, or maybe it 

5

was the government pointed out.  (A)(1) does not refer 

6

to two statutes of limitations.  It says if the 

7

applicable limitations period for such action as specified in 

8

the State statute of limitations provides a commencement 

9

date which is earlier.  Now, you know, if they were 

10

really covering two different, or envisioned that in 

11

some States you had two statutes of limitations, it 

12

seems to me they should have phrased it differently:  If 

13

the applicable limitations period or periods for such 

14

action as specified in the States' statutes of 

15

limitations provide  provides a commencement date or 

16

commencement dates, something like that.  It's all in 

17

the singular. 

18

 MR. KORZEN: 

Yes, Justice Scalia.  Let me 

19

address the singular point.  What we have here again is 

20

a hybrid statute of limitations with two periods, which 

21

were rare then and rare now.  But in that rare 

22

situation, the applicable limitations period is the one 

23

that a defendant is asking the court to apply to dismiss 

24

a case with prejudice.  And in this case, that's the 

25

10year period.  That's the applicable limitations

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

period. 
 Now, the Petitioner, on the other hand, and 

3

the government, they both say there's no period in this 

4

case  there's no period in this case where a case may 

5

have been brought.  So in other words, under their 

6

reading, there is no applicable period, and that  the 

7

statute here can easily be read to have two periods 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't know why you 

are  you are even caring.  Isn't the applicable 

10

limitations period, as far as you are concerned, the 

11

period in which you can bring a suit?  And that would be 

12

the shorter one under all circumstances.  And aren't you 

13

saying that statutes of repose are preempted because you 

14

couldn't bring a suit? 

15

 MR. KORZEN: 

Yes, Your Honor.  And 

16

that's shows  that gets to the contradiction that was 

17

brought up during the Petitioner's argument.  The 

18

Petitioner argues that Congress only addressed one part 

19

of the study group's recommendations, the discovery rule 

20

but not repose periods.  But on the other hand they 

21

argue, under our reading, a repose period would never 

22

apply.  And that's  that shows that the study group's 

23

recommendations were carried out. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But, you know, the statute 

does not refer to your cause of action, so it's hard to

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say that the period refers to  it refers to is the 

2

period that you are trying to get around.  It says if 

3

the limitations period for such action, that is, any 

4

action brought under  any action brought under State 

5

law. 

6

 I think to read that as applying to whatever 

7

limitations period is asserted by  against a 

8

particular plaintiff, I find it hard to read it that 

9

way.  It seems to me they're referring to a limitations 

10

period for the action that exists under State law, 

11

regardless of what is alleged in the particular 

12

complaint.  Anyway, I  I think you got a real problem 

13

with the singular versus plural phrasing of number (1). 

14

 MR. KORZEN: 

Well, to say one more thing 

15

about singular versus plural, we have cited the 

16

Dictionary Act, 1 U.S. A.  1 U.S.A.  U.S.C. 1 which says 

17

that the singular ordinarily is read as the plural. 

18

Now, I know there's been a couple of decisions saying 

19

that's a rarelyapplied rule. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I mean, I take it, Mr. 

21

Korzen, that your argument is a little bit different.  I 

22

mean, it seems Justice Scalia would have a point if it 

23

just said if the limitations period.  Your argument is 

24

that you put in the word "applicable" and it actually 

25

makes the statute read a little bit differently.  It

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

suggests that there are plural limitations period and 

2

the one that this provision applies to is whichever one 

3

happens to be applicable as you apply the provision. 

4
5
6

 MR. KORZEN: 

I think that's exactly right, 

Justice Kagan 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah, except they are both 

7

applicable to this cause of action.  They  both of 

8

those periods are applicable.  You run afoul of one of 

9

them, but not of the other one.  It doesn't mean 

10

they're  they are not both applicable.  Anyway, this 

11

is  this is  it is angels on the head of a pin, 

12

isn't it? 

13

 (Laughter.) 

14

 MR. KORZEN: 

If I could speak a little bit 

15

about commencement date, commencement date is defined as 

16

the beginning of the period when an action may be 

17

brought.  And Petitioner and the government argue that 

18

there never was a period when an action may be brought 

19

here.  And in fact  however, on page 18, we've cited 

20

numerous authorities that define a repose period as 

21

exactly that, when an action may be brought.  That's a 

22

definition for a repose period. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if you take this, the 

24

facts of this case, 10year statute of repose, there was 

25

never a time when these plaintiffs  when this  these

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiffs had an action that could be brought, just 

2

because the 10year limitation ended their right to sue 

3

before they had a claim. 

4

 MR. KORZEN: 

Yes, Your Honor, except that 

5

that's not how the terms are defined.  And we've cited 

6

cases on page 18 of  North Carolina cases, in fact, 

7

and also the corpus Juris section that Petitioner relied 

8

on defining a statute of repose exactly as that, as a 

9

period when an action may be brought when. 

10

 Now, in their reply brief, Petitioner 

11

says  faced with those authorities, Petitioner says, 

12

Well, no, no, a repose period is actually a period after 

13

which an action may not be brought. 

14

 But that's really just two ways of saying 

15

the same thing.  When an action may be brought or a 

16

period after which an action may not be brought. 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, it depends 

18

whether they have a discovery rule or not, whether it's 

19

a period when an action may be brought or whether it's a 

20

period after which an action may not be brought.  And 

21

the whole purpose of this was to require a discovery 

22

rule.  And once you require a discovery rule, the 

23

statute of repose has completely independent meaning, 

24

complete  serves a completely independent office. 

25

 MR. KORZEN: 

The purpose, however, Mr. Chief

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice, was to preserve claims for latent harm, no 

2

matter what the period was that began.  The purpose was 

3

to have a uniform trigger date that started the time to 

4

bring an action once you had discovered your harm. 

5

 And if you use the defined terms here, then 

6

it applies to any type of period, whether you call it a 

7

limitations period or repose period, no matter what you 

8

call it. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but the 

10

purpose of the statute of repose is not to preserve 

11

latent causes of action.  It's quite the opposite.  It's 

12

to put an end to in particular latent causes of action 

13

that haven't been brought. 

14

 MR. KORZEN: 

Yes, Your Honor, but Congress's 

15

purpose was to preserve claims, no matter what the 

16

period was.  Congress's  Congress was concerned about 

17

people not having their day in court  and this is in 

18

the House conference report; it's all over the study 

19

group report  people not having their day in court 

20

because a period ran before they  began to run before 

21

they discovered their harm.  And that applies to whoever 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Was Congress doing away 

23

with  I don't know if any such State exists, but 

24

assume a State said, nah, we're tired of environmental 

25

claims.  You can't have them.  We're not going to have

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

one at all.  Was Congress preempting that decision? 
 MR. KORZEN: 

Not here in 9658, Your Honor. 

No, Congress was preempting the commencement date 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So why isn't a repose 

5

like that?  Why isn't a statute of repose simply a 

6

decision that you just can't have a claim at all if it's 

7

older than 20 years old? 

8
9

 MR. KORZEN: 

Well, going back to the plain 

wording, Your Honor, it has a commencement date.  It has 

10

a beginning.  It begins from the defendant's last act. 

11

It does have a beginning.  And it's not 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it's not a 

13

commencement date in terms  "commencement" means 

14

commencement of a lawsuit.  The true trigger for the 

15

statute of repose here is not a commencement of a 

16

lawsuit date.  It is the commencement of the running of 

17

the limitation period.  But it isn't the time when you 

18

can commence a lawsuit. 

19

 MR. KORZEN: 

It is the beginning of the 

20

period of a time when an action may be brought, which is 

21

exactly how Congress defined the term.  It is  it does 

22

have a commencement date because it does have a 

23

beginning, and it does define a period when an action

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you couldn't commence 

an action.  Say the last  the defendant commits the

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

last act, and then plaintiff sues the next day.  Well, 

2

plaintiff can't sue the next day because the plaintiff 

3

doesn't know that she's been injured. 

4
5
6

 MR. KORZEN: 

Correct, Your Honor.  But that 

is not how Congress defined the terms.  Congress gave specific
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

They picked up  they 

7

picked up on State statutes.  And as I understand it, 

8

the very purpose of the statute of repose or the 

9

builtin statute of limitations is to check the 

10

discovery rule, to say, we don't want the discovery rule 

11

to operate after a certain amount of time, a certain 

12

amount of time has passed. 

13

 So the notion of what has been called a 

14

statute of repose and a discovery rule, the very purpose 

15

of the repose statute is to say no discovery here. 

16

 MR. KORZEN: 

That is  that is correct, 

17

Your Honor, and that was not Congress's purpose. 

18

Congress wasn't  in this specific area of hazardous 

19

waste released into the environment, Congress's purpose 

20

wasn't figuring out the difference between these 

21

different statutes and whether the State wanted to bar 

22

claims or not.  Congress was trying to preserve claims, 

23

and used defined terms that do preserve claims, no 

24

matter what  no matter what you call the type of 

25

period.  Congress was trying to preserve claims for long

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

latency illness.  That's very apparent. 
 And my friends, the Petitioner and the 

3

government, you'll notice in their brief they maybe 

4

mentioned latency once.  Today at oral argument, neither 

5

have mentioned latency.  That's  that's what Congress 

6

was concerned about.  It's all over the study group 

7

report.  It's in the House conference report more times 

8

than they brought up here.  Latency and long latency 

9

illness is exactly what Congress was concerned about. 

10

And repose periods affect that more than any other type 

11

of limitations period. 

12

 So if I could talk a little bit about the 

13

purpose of the Act.  The evolution of this statute is 

14

very important here.  It dates back to 9651, which was 

15

enacted in 1980, when CERCLA itself was enacted.  9651 

16

set up the study group to study barriers to recovery, 

17

to  in cases involving harm to man and the 

18

environment, barriers to recovery. 

19

 And the study group was a very distinguished 

20

group with attorneys generals and others from the legal 

21

community.  And the study group determined that a main 

22

barrier to recovery were limitations periods that ran 

23

before people discovered their harm and unanimously 

24

recommended that States act to enact discovery rules but 

25

also abolish repose periods.  And then the House

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

conference report states that's what was addressed, the 

2

problem of long latency illnesses 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But it seems an awfully 

4

strange way to abolish a repose period, right?  I mean, 

5

one way to abolish a repose period is just to abolish a 

6

repose period.  Another way is to say what Congress 

7

seems to have said here, which is move the first date of 

8

the period of repose up to a new Federal commencement 

9

date so that the period of repose wholly  is wholly 

10
11
12
13

redundant as to the limitations period. 
 Now, that's a kind of strange way to do a 
pretty simple thing, isn't it? 
 MR. KORZEN: 

I disagree, Justice Kagan. 

14

It's a very short statute.  And what you've just said, 

15

as the amicus brief  as the amicus brief for Jerome 

16

Ensminger and others pointed out, it's a very simple 

17

and effective way of accomplishing this.  It's a short 

18

statute, and then, as you say, it does away with repose 

19

periods that have actually run.  So it's actually a 

20

fairly compact and effective way of doing that. 

21

 Yet also, it's also respectful for States' 

22

rights in a couple of ways.  It  rather than creating 

23

a new cause of action, it allows the State  the 

24

content of State law to continue.  It's just the 

25

starting point that was affected.  It's respectful of

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

States' rights in that way.  And also very few States 

2

even have one of these repose periods.  So it was a very 

3

simple and effective way to do it, not a  you know, 

4

perhaps it could be done  be done differently.  And we 

5

could always say Congress could be more clear.  But it's 

6

actually a very simple and clear and effective way of 

7

doing that. 

8
9

 And the other side by saying that the 
statute effectively eliminates repose periods shows how 

10

effective that is.  That's on Petitioner's brief, 

11

page 14.  It's in the government's argument today, that 

12

the statute makes repose periods superfluous.  Or in 

13

other words, they've been abolished.  It's actually a 

14

very, very simple and short 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, wait.  On the 

16

one hand I thought you just told us they were respectful 

17

of the States' concerns.  And now you say they 

18

completely abolished repose periods. 

19

 MR. KORZEN: 

Yes, Your Honor, I said it 

20

was  yes, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's respectful in that 

21

it allowed State law to continue.  And if you look at 

22

what Congress was facing 

23
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I'm sorry. 

Not the State law with respect to repose. 
 MR. KORZEN: 

No.  But the State  the State

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

tort claims we're talking about, such as nuisance and 

2

trespass and negligence, and the entire content of State 

3

law is respected.  And I do have to correct something my 

4

friend Mr. Murray said.  Repose periods under North 

5

Carolina law, they are not an element of a defense that 

6

has  that has to be pled. 

7

 I've been a North Carolina attorney 

8

continuously since 1992.  I have to tell you as an 

9

officer of the court, they are not pled as part of 

10

complaints.  And when somebody wants to move based on a 

11

repose period, they do it the same way they would move 

12

to dismiss under any limitations period under a Rule 

13

12(b)(6) or 12(b)(2) motion. 

14
15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 
pled? 

16

 MR. KORZEN: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

18
19

Is it waived if it's not 

Is which waived? 
Is the statute of repose 

waived if it's not raised as a defense? 
 MR. KORZEN: 

There are conflicting State 

20

cases on that.  I think some say  well, it would be 

21

pled at some point.  It doesn't have to be raised as an 

22

affirmative defense, as some cases say.  It doesn't have 

23

to be raised as an affirmative defense, as some cases 

24

say.  But it is raised in the same way.  It's not an 

25

element  it's not an element a court would look at in,

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

like, a TwomblyIqbaltype situation and say, well, you 

2

didn't plead this as an element. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if the State wanted to 

4

enact a very long statute of repose, and they said, 

5

look:  We want to protect latent claims, but there has 

6

to be some limit.  So we're going to  we're going to 

7

enact a statute of repose of 30 years or 50 years. 

8

Under your reading, that would be wiped out as well, 

9

right? 

10

 MR. KORZEN: 

It would, Your Honor, and the 

11

reason why, the reason why is what the Congress was 

12

concerned about here, which was long latency periods. 

13

And periods of up to 40 years are mentioned in the study 

14

group report.  And though that seems like a long period, 

15

see, this is really a policy decision.  Limitations 

16

periods are really pure policy.  This Court said so back 

17

in 1945 and other times, and Congress made that as a 

18

policy decision. 

19

 If the polluter is not on the hook after 30 

20

years, who would be, Justice Alito?  It would be the 

21

innocent neighbor living nearby?  The innocent cancer 

22

victim?  All of us as taxpayers?  Congress made that 

23

policy choice that it should be the polluting company 

24

that's put the environmental  hazardous waste into the 

25

environment.

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And, again, it has limited  it does have a 

2

very specific focus, this statute.  It's limited to 

3

hazardous wastes released from a facility into the 

4

environment.  And in that situation, Congress made the 

5

policy choice:  The polluter, you are on the hook, you 

6

stay on the hook, you clean it up as long as it takes. 

7

 And the other side  the result  think 

8

about what the result would be here for the other side. 

9

After 10 years, no liability.  The incentive there would 

10

be, instead of cleanup, which is the reason 9658 has 

11

been passed, instead of cleanup, that would encourage 

12

coverup.  And Congress did not want that.  Congress 

13

wanted, again, polluters to be on the hook as long as it 

14

took to clean up.  In the 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

16
17

It encouraged what did 

you say? 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But you said it 

18

wanted to have polluters on the hook, but they didn't 

19

even take  if the State did not have any basis of 

20

recovery, this did nothing about that at all.  It did 

21

not  it did not require States to adopt particular 

22

remedies or extend the remedies to cover this.  If they 

23

didn't have remedies for this type of action, the act 

24

the provisions we're talking about now did nothing about 

25

that at all.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KORZEN: 

Well, 9658, Mr. Chief Justice, 

2

talks about any action under State law for harm to 

3

people or property from hazardous wastes released into 

4

the environment.  And so 9658 was specifically looking 

5

at actions for this type of environmental harm. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But the more you talk about 

7

horribles that could happen, a State could say, with 

8

respect to the special cause of action for creating harm 

9

to individuals by hazardous waste, the statute will 

10

begin upon discovery and it will last for 3 months.  A 

11

State could do that, right?  And that would comply with 

12

this law, wouldn't it?  A 3month statute of 

13

limitations.  All the Federal law refers to is when the 

14

statute commences.  But it  it still is left up to the 

15

State to say how long the statute can be, isn't it? 

16

 MR. KORZEN: 

As long as  what 9658 

17

establishes, Justice Scalia, is a floor.  States can do 

18

more, but the floor is 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. KORZEN: 

21
22

No, no. 
When you've discovered your 

harm. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You can answer "yes" or 

23

"no" to that, I think.  The State can make the statute 

24

of limitations as short as it wants so long as it 

25

commences upon the discovery.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KORZEN: 

Yeah, yes, Your Honor, discovery 

2

of the cause of the harm. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So I can  I can imagine a 

4

lot of horribles that can occur with that, just as you 

5

can imagine horribles that occur under the other system. 

6

 MR. KORZEN: 

7

 A couple of other points. 

Yes, yes, certainly, Your Honor. 
The Petitioner's 

8

argument and the government's argument relies very much 

9

on accrual, and "accrual" was not a term even used in 

10

9658.  The plain wording does not even use "accrual," 

11

and so that's something we wanted to point out. 

12

 And the study group report itself on page 59 

13

envisioned tort liability under the Federal Tort Claims 

14

Act if the government was the owner of property and had 

15

been negligent with the property.  So actions against 

16

the government were foreseen. 

17

 The study group report again  the concern 

18

expressed repeatedly about latency also noted that the 

19

problem here is due to groundwater contamination from 

20

industrial solvents.  That's exactly what we have in 

21

this case.  So back in 1982, the study group envisioned 

22

the problems that the country was having, which was 

23

groundwater contamination from industrial solvents. 

24

This contamination 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The study group was

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

making recommendations to the States, and it made two 

2

discrete recommendations.  One is time the statute of 

3

limitations from awareness of the injury and its cause; 

4

and the second was, instructing to the States, don't 

5

have any repose statutes because they will defeat our 

6

purpose of taking into account latency. 

7

 So the study group is addressing State law. 

8

Then Congress does something different.  It provides a 

9

Federal limitation period that is based on discovery of 

10

the injury plus the cause.  The second recommendation 

11

made by the study committee abolished statutes of 

12

repose.  Congress didn't do that. 

13

 MR. KORZEN: 

Well, I disagree as to them not 

14

having done both, Your Honor.  If you  Congress did 

15

not use the word "repose" in 9658.  The  you know, but 

16

the word choice doesn't matter.  If you use the 

17

definitions, Congress effectively did both, and that 

18

that's our argument.  Congress Congress did do both.  Rather than 

19

waiting on the States to do both, Congress itself did 

20

both in 9658. 

21

 And to follow up an earlier question of 

22

yours, Justice Ginsburg, a result to the contrary here 

23

would result  could result in a race to the bottom, if 

24

you will, where States were then incentivized or, you 

25

know, lobbied to enact repose periods.  Other States

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could do this, and that would be the sort of race to the 

2

bottom Congress would not want.  So that is possible.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is there any sign 

4

that that's happening?  I mean, it seems to me that 

5

these are, as you know, rare and have been rare for some 

6

time, right?  I mean  do you really expect States to 

7

start suddenly enacting statutes of repose?

 MR. KORZEN: 

With today's lobbying climate, 

I wouldn't put it past the realm of possibility. And it was something
 THE COURT: 

Are there lobbyists on both 

sides of the issue? 
 MR. KORZEN: 

I  I don't want to hazard a 

13

guess as to the relative powers of the lobbyists, but I 

14

think they may  I think they may go one way and not in 

15

favor the environment. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

17
18

Do you want us to write an 

opinion that we can't trust State legislatures? 
 MR. KORZEN: 

No, Your Honor.  What I meant 

19

with that was to follow up an earlier question of 

20

Justice Ginsburg's that I thought was suggesting that. 

21

 If I could end with one  with one final 

22

hypothetical.  Imagine two individuals at age 18 both 

23

enrolling in  enlisting in the Marines.  And one is 

24

stationed by the government in Camp Pendleton in 

25

California and, after 10 years of being transferred out

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of Camp Pendleton, develops a fatal cancer.  His 

2

relatives would not at all be barred because there is no 

3

repose period in California. 

4

 Imagine another individual, enlisted at the 

5

same time, stationed by the government at Camp LeJeune 

6

in North Carolina, and after being sent from North 

7

Carolina, developed the same cancer.  The relatives in 

8

California would have a claim, the North Carolinians 

9

the relatives of the North Carolinian would not. 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

11

 Mr. Murray, you have four minutes remaining.

13

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN J. MURRAY 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

14

 MR. MURRAY: 

15

 Briefly, I just would cite  just to 

Thank you, Your Honors. 

16

respond to a point my brother made here.  I would cite 

17

the Hargett v. Holland, 447 S.E.2d 787 in the North 

18

Carolina Supreme Court, as well as Tipton and Young 

19

Construction Company, 446 S.E.2d 603 from the North 

20

Carolina Court of Appeals, both of which made clear that 

21

statutes of repose are conditions precedent that must be 

22

specifically pled under North Carolina law. 

23

 But the broader point is simply this: 

24

CERCLA as originally enacted is a cleanup statute 

25

designed to tag people who have touched the property at

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all with cleanup responsibility regardless of fault. 

2

That's what it did when it was enacted in 1980 and 

3

that's what it still continues to do today. 

4

 When Congress, in 1986, in response to the 

5

study group report, enacted this 1960  9658 section, 

6

this small surgical change, it did so using defined 

7

terms that  and it said what it meant and it meant 

8

what it said.  Applicable limitations period doesn't 

9

mean any one that might apply, it's defined in the 

10

statute, and may be brought is linked up with beginning 

11

of may be brought.  That is classic formulation at the 

12

beginning of the statute of limitations, not a statute 

13

of repose, which commences with defendant's last act. 

14

 And again, this just makes sense. 

In 

15

drafting this statute, Congress was expressly trying to 

16

minimize  it may or may not have had in its head 

17

specifically the presumption against preemption, but 

18

this Court presumes that it does.  It was seeking to 

19

minimize intrusion into a traditional area of State 

20

regulation, and we know that because the statute on its 

21

face says:  "State law generally applies except as 

22

provided in this provision."  It leaves all the State 

23

law intact other than this commencement date and 

24

conspicuously does so.  And the presumption against 

25

preemption, and the legislative history only confirmed

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this, Congress wanted 50 flowers to bloom in this area 

2

and it didn't cut that off.  And for good reason. 

3

 Repose is an important piece of this puzzle. 

4

It's the counterbalance to the discovery rules that were 

5

being enacted by these States in this tumultuous period. 

6

By setting a statute of repose, you avoid the very real 

7

possibility that a client like mine can be sued over a 

8

site  I mean, there's a fence around a hole in the 

9

ground there now.  My client hasn't  has abandoned 

10

this site in 1987.  This suit was brought in 2009. 

11

Asking clients to defend these cases, where are the 

12

documents?  Where are the witnesses?  How do you avoid 

13

vexatious litigation designed to shake down settlements 

14

40, 50 and 60 years after you've abandoned a site? 

15

 What Congress did here makes absolute sense 

16

and the narrow and surgical way in which they did it, 

17

given that they were acting in a traditional field of 

18

State law supremacy, makes all the sense in the world. 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, that last 

20

argument about, you know, liability 30, 40 years later, 

21

I think 46 States have that.  Have it that way.  And 

22

Congress wasn't all that worried about that and there 

23

isn't a very strong policy argument that  that says 

24

it's not  that it's so fundamentally unfair that you 

25

shouldn't do it.

 MR. MURRAY: 

Well, again, Your Honor, 

2

actually, a lot of those States have statutes of repose 

3

that deal with property specifically, not personal 

4

injury.  It gets a little bit messy because there's not 

5

a perfect match there.  But the bottom line is the way 

6

in which Congress acted here is not at all surprising, 

7

given that they knew they were acting in a traditional 

8

State field, from the heartland of State authority 

9

which, was State tort law. 

10

 Unless the Court has further questions.
