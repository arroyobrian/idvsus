 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

in Case 13485, Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland 

5

v. Wynne.

 Mr. Brockman. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. BROCKMAN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 A State's broad power to impose a personal 

12

net income tax on its own residents is grounded in the 

13

special benefits that a State affords to its own 

14

residents particularly because they are residents.  That 

15

is, things like public schools, social services 

16

programs, medical assistance services, and of course the 

17

right to vote in the process that determines both the 

18

level of those benefits and the level of taxes that are 

19

paid in return for them. 

20

 There is no reason that a State should have 

21

to subordinate this power, this taxing power, just 

22

because another State, exercising an equally legitimate 

23

taxing power, but on a very distinct ground, is taxing a 

24

portion of that income merely because it was earned 

25

within that State's borders.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right, you're relying on the 

principle that life is not fair, right? 
 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Life is not fair.  Maryland 

taxes are. 

5

 (Laughter.) 

6

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Because all residents are 

7

treated the same.  They are taxed on their entire income 

8

regardless of where it is earned. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but as  as 

10

your friends on the other side point out in their 

11

example at pages 22 to 23 of their brief, if you do the 

12

internal consistency test, it ends up not being equal. 

13

What it ends up is imposing a special tax  they even 

14

call it special, right, the special nonresident's tax 

15

on those who live in one State and work in the other, 

16

that people who live in the State and work in the State 

17

do not have to pay.  That doesn't sound  that sounds 

18

unequal, whether fair or not. 

19

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Your Honor, let me try and 

20

explain why I  why I disagree that it's unfair.  The 

21

special nonresident tax and the county tax both apply, 

22

one to residents, one to nonresidents.  One has been 

23

upheld, the special nonresident tax, as a complimentary 

24

tax to the other. 

25

 But we can abstract from all of that because

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

our position as a constitutional matter is that Maryland 

2

is not required to provide a credit at all. 

3

 So, it would be just as accurate to do the 

4

math this way.  The special nonresident tax accounts for 

5

6/10ths of 1 percent of total personal income tax 

6

collections, both resident and nonresident, combined 

7

State and local.  If we've said instead there's only one 

8

tax, it's a State income tax, and you may take a credit 

9

up to the lesser of what you paid the other State or 

10

99.4 percent of what you would have paid to Maryland, 

11

whichever is lesser, we would have the same result. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But that's the case 

13

now.  If we uphold the situation where you charge a 

14

special nonresident tax in a way that is a special tax 

15

on people who live in one State and work in the other, 

16

then you're free to raise that to whatever amount you 

17

want.  The fact that it's a smaller amount now 

18

doesn't  if we say it's okay, then you're free to 

19

raise it. 

20

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Well, I don't think we are, 

21

Your Honor.  It's been upheld by the Maryland courts 

22

because it's complimentary and it's set at the lowest 

23

rate that any county resident pays.  Many county 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It is now.  Do you 

think there's  could you increase the special

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

nonresident tax beyond the lowest rate that the county 

2

tax is? 

3

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

I don't think we'd try.  We 

4

believe  I think the reason it's set at the lowest is 

5

because we did not want to be in a situation where we 

6

were discriminating against nonresidents who are 

7

entitled to 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

To be specific, you live in 

California.  You have a hot dog stand in Hawaii.  All 

10

right?  It has a $1,000 income.  It comes back to 

11

California.  You pay a 131/2 percent California tax. 

12

Hawaii wants to charge another 12.  So you're paying 25 

13

percent.  Can California say:  That's fine; we give them 

14

no credit for the 11 percent they're paying in Hawaii? 

15

So the bottom check that you get is $750, not a 1,000. 

16

But if your hot dog stand were in California, the check 

17

would not be 750, it would be approximately 900.  Okay? 

18

 Now, is that constitutional or not? 

19

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21
22
23

It is, Your Honor. 
Okay.  That's what I 

thought.  Then your answer 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Move  move to Hawaii is 

what you're saying. 

24

 (Laughter.) 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And a lot of people do

6

Alderson Reporting Company

2

that, for tax reasons. 
 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Well, that's right, Your 

3

Honor.  The Wynnes are our citizens, though, and we'd 

4

prefer that they express their preferences through 

5

voice, not exit.  But of course 

6
7

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA : 

A lot are moving out of 

Maryland, too. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What is your best case 

that you can rely on for your answer to Justice Breyer? 

10

What's the best case you can cite,Complete Auto?  I 

11

don't think that works for you. 

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

I wouldn't cite Complete 

Auto.  I don't think it works here. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, I wouldn't if I were 

you trying to justify the answer either. 
 What would you cite? 

What would your best 

cite be. 
 MR. BROCKMAN: 

I might start with Jefferson 

19

Lines because it demonstrates that there are situations 

20

where only one claim  State can claim to be taxing a 

21

value on the specific basis it is taxing it on, but many 

22

other States can be taxing it on a different basis. 

23

That results in multiple taxation of the type that we're 

24

talking about. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Here in my hypothetical the

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

basis is identical.  It's called an income tax, okay? 

2

And they run it in both States the same, and the problem 

3

that I would like you specifically  and you are 

4

addressing with Justice Kennedy  is what California 

5

says, open your hot dog stands in California.  You go 

6

and open them in every other State and any other State, 

7

but particularly Hawaii, you will pay $125 more in 

8

income tax, not some flat other thing, not property tax, 

9

not some other kind of tax, in income tax.  Okay.  Now, 

10
11

that's constitutional because? 
 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Because California taxes the 

12

income from hot dog stands without regard to where the 

13

hot dog stand is located.  The  the additional tax 

14

burden there is a result of the combination of two 

15

States' taxes, Hawaii's and California's.  It can't be 

16

said 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The question is not whether 

18

California can tax the income of its residents wherever 

19

they make it or whether California can tax all income 

20

earned within the border of California.  The question is 

21

whether it can do both, whether  and that's the 

22

question with respect to you.  Can you tax all income 

23

earned within your border, whether by resident or by 

24

nonresident, and also tax income earned by your 

25

residents in  in other States?

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The tax economists' brief points out that 

2

this  what you've done operates exactly like a tariff, 

3

because it provides an incentive to earn income in 

4

Maryland and not outside of Maryland.  Now, do you 

5

dispute that as a factual matter?  And if you don't 

6

dispute it as a factual matter, why shouldn't this tax 

7

system meet exactly the same fate as a tariff? 

8
9

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

I don't dispute the 

mathematics.  They lose me when they switch from tariffs 

10

to income taxes, but I'm not an economist.  The 

11

difference, though, is that the  we're talking about 

12

the effect of two States's taxes.  Now, they've talked 

13

about two States' taxes by using what they call a 

14

heuristic device of hypothesizing that the other State 

15

has the exact same set of taxes.  Fine.  We can do that, 

16

too. 

17

 But the point is that it's the combined 

18

effect.  That means that Maryland's taxes, the validity 

19

of Maryland's tax, will turn on how another State 

20

exercises its taxing powers. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
Every State 
That's my problem, is I 

24

don't I understand why it is that California has to 

25

yield in this CaliforniaHawaii situation.  Why is it

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the State that taxes all the income of its 

2

residents has to yield rather than the State that taxes 

3

all income earned in the State?  Why can't you just as 

4

well say, you know, Hawaii shouldn't be able to sock on 

5

an addition? 

6
7
8
9

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Well, there are good 

reasons 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, as far as fairness 

is concerned.  Now, maybe it doesn't work the same way 

10

with respect to the imaginary negative Commerce Clause, 

11

but  but as far as fairness is concerned, I don't  I 

12

don't see the difference. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Your position  your 

14

position is that the residents  the domicile can tax 

15

worldwide income, period.  And I think everybody agrees 

16

with that.  The question is:  Does the domicile have to 

17

give a credit because somebody else is also taxing it? 

18

Do you stop having the power to tax worldwide income 

19

because other States may tax on a different basis? 

20

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

I think that is the question, 

21

Your Honor:  Must the State yield to another State's 

22

taxation of a portion of that income, but on a very 

23

distinct ground, a territorial ground?  It was  the 

24

argument that State would make is:  Well, we think you 

25

earned it here, and if you did we have a right to tax

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

it. 
 Our argument with respect of our own 

3

residents is:  We think you live here, and the Wynnes 

4

indisputably do, and that you benefit from the same 

5

privileges  I'm sorry, Your Honor. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I was just 

7

going to say it's not a question of yielding.  The way 

8

you test under our precedents whether one State has to 

9

yield or not is to say, well, let's suppose each State 

10

does exactly the same thing, neither one is yielding. 

11

And as indicated earlier, the example in the 

12

Respondents' brief is that if each State did what we're 

13

talking about, people who work in one State and live in 

14

another would pay higher taxes overall than people who 

15

live within one State and work in the same State.  And 

16

that sounds to me like a tariff. 

17

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Well, perhaps this is another 

18

way to address the internal consistency analysis and 

19

demonstrate why we think it doesn't do very much good 

20

analytic work here.  If you take just a single sentence in 

21

one of this Court's opinions in Curry, "Income may be 

22

taxed both by the state where it is earned and by the 

23

state of the recipient's domicile," points internal 

24

consistency, that's it.  If you add the feature that 

25

there  there's a credit or not, that's the issue here,

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and if, as in Chickasaw Nation that the offering of that 

2

credit is understood correctly as an independent policy 

3

decision that states make and is not of constitutional 

4

magnitude, is not done as a matter of constitutional 

5

compulsion, then the internal consistency problem 

6

remains. 

7

 We think the internal consistency test works 

8

better, though not perfectly, when we're talking about 

9

two states taxing on the same basis.  Because there, it 

10

may detect instances where one state is overreaching 

11

jurisdictionally, exercising a power that it does not 

12

lawfully have.  The respondents don't argue that 

13

Maryland lacks this power, they acknowledge it.  They 

14

and they acknowledge it as an attribute of Maryland's 

15

sovereignty.  If it were Situs v. Situs, Source v. 

16

Source, there the internal consistency test can tell 

17

whether  sometimes  whether the multiple taxation, 

18

the tax is a result of discrimination or of 

19

extraterritorial application of laws.  But that neither 

20

of those is present here 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's not the Commerce 

22

Clause test, though.  The cases where we've applied that 

23

test, has that  have they been decided under the 

24

Commerce Clause? 

25

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

The internal consistency

12

Alderson Reporting Company

test?

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

 MR. BROCKMAN:

7

Yes. 
I think  I think they 

have 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I thought it  I thought 

it's a matter of state power. 
 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Well, I think this case does 

8

not present any issues that are unique to the Commerce 

9

Clause case, because it's undisputed that Maryland's tax 

10

does not facially discriminate.  It's evenhanded in its 

11

application.  Only after the tax liability is determined 

12

does it take into account the source, and there it gives 

13

an advantage to the people who have earned some of it 

14

out of state. 

15

 So what we're left with is an argument of 

16

the discrimination here is in the supposed 

17

malapportionment itself.  And that question, the 

18

question of apportionment, fair apportionment, I think 

19

is common to both the due process and Commerce Clause 

20

jurisprudence of this Court, and I think Maryland's tax 

21

survives that scrutiny under both 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What about  we're 

23

dealing with an individual because it's a Chapter S 

24

corporation, but what about a corporation that is 

25

domiciled in Maryland?  I think Maryland, like all

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

states, uses an apportionment formula for both domestic 

2

and foreign corporations. 

3

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

We don't believe this case 

4

implicates any question of how corporations would be 

5

taxed.  The residence principle that we're relying on as 

6

a basis for the broad taxing power and the benefits that 

7

one receives as residents is unique to individuals, and 

8

it's always been articulated in cases involving 

9

individuals, so we're talking about personal income 

10
11

taxes here.  And it might very well 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I suppose you could 

12

argue that some states are very  have very good 

13

corporation laws and that's why corporations are 

14

domiciled there.  They're, let's say, director friendly 

15

or that they are laws that are easy to apply and well 

16

understood.  That  that's a significant advantage. 

17

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

I think that's absolutely 

18

correct, Your Honor.  I think this Court's precedents 

19

recognize some benefit that's accorded merely in the 

20

fact of domiciliary status, whatever  however that's 

21

defined.  And  but being in the net income tax 

22

situation for corporations, I'm not aware of any state 

23

that tries to assign a value to that because 

24

nondomiciliary and domiciliary corporations are treated 

25

equally.

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Now, I do know that Delaware, known to be 

2

hospitable to corporations for incorporation purposes, 

3

does impose a tax, a yearly franchise tax, that ranges 

4

from $180  from $225 to $180,000 annually, and that 

5

it's not based on income, it's based on a very complex 

6

measure of the worth of the entire enterprise. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can we go back to the 

8

Chief's initial question.  If we applied Complete Auto, 

9

would you fail the internal consistency test?  And if 

10

you fail it, why shouldn't we apply that test here? 

11

Would you  if we applied it, would you fail it? 

12

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

I don't believe we would 

13

because I think the proper construction of that test in 

14

this situation asks about the internal consistency of 

15

the rationale that Maryland is advancing, that is, are 

16

we being consistent in our structure  in structuring 

17

our tax so that it reaches residents on their entire 

18

income regardless of whether it's earned. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I must say I am confused 

20

about what this case involved.  You argue, and I find it 

21

surprising, that it involves both the Commerce Clause 

22

and any other constitutional prohibition.  Okay? 

23

Whereas your opponents, the question they say is 

24

presented is whether a state tax that exposes interstate 

25

commerce to double taxation is saved from invalidation

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under the Commerce Clause, merely because the state 

2

why do you want to take on the whole Constitution when 

3

they only want to argue about the Commerce Clause? 

4

 MR. BROCKMAN: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6
7

Your Honor 
And I thought it was the 

latter that the case involves. 
 MR. BROCKMAN: 

We'd be willing to defend it 

8

under any provision of the Constitution.  But, Your 

9

Honor 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that's big of you. 

It really is. 
 MR. BROCKMAN: 

And the chief concern that 

13

this Court has articulated of its dormant Commerce 

14

Clause protection  jurisprudence, that is, protecting 

15

against measures that are protectionist in nature and 

16

benefit instaters at the expense of outofstaters is 

17

not present here.  There is no discrimination or 

18

extraterritorial overreaching, and the tax is valid.

 SUPPORTING PETITIONER

3

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 I'd like to begin, if I could, by the 

4

interaction of taxes imposed on the jurisdictional 

5

rationale of residency, and taxes imposed on 

6

nonresidents by virtue of their doing business in the 

7

state. 

8
9

 I don't think there's any constitutional 
rule that says a state can only impose one tax or the 

10

other.  And to the extent the internal consistency test 

11

might suggest that the special nonresident tax that 

12

Maryland imposes, which is a special tax imposed only on 

13

nonresidents, may be taking too great a portion of 

14

nonresidents' income, I think it's kind of backwards for 

15

respondents to be able to raise that challenge because 

16

they are residents.  They pay only the residential 

17

income taxes and, in fact, benefit from any overtaxing 

18

of nonresidents. 

19

 The other thing I would 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You only have to look at the 

21

tax scheme as a whole including the tax on nonresidents? 

22

I mean 

23

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, I think the 

24

very important thing to understand here is we're talking 

25

about two very different kinds of income taxes with

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

distinct jurisdictional rationales.  Maryland is taxing 

2

respondent's income because they are residents of 

3

Maryland.  Other states are taxing their income because 

4

they do business there.  I'm not sure you would 

5

necessarily look at them and mix and match.  And I'm not 

6

aware of any case in which this Court has taken a 

7

completely nondiscriminatory tax  like Maryland's 

8

county income tax which applies at the same rate to a 

9

county resident no matter where he earns his income in 

10

state or out of state, and finds that tax to be 

11

unconstitutional by yoking it to some other tax like the 

12

special nonresident tax that's going to look 

13

discriminatory no matter what other scheme of taxes you 

14

throw it into. 

15
16
17

 But, if you really did think there was a 
problem 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I thought that we held that 

18

quite a lot in respect to corporate taxes.  The three 

19

cases we found here, J.D. Adams, Gwin White & Prince, 

20

Hennerford, Central Greyhound of New York, all said that 

21

corporations, when they are taxed on their income by a 

22

state, that they have to apportion in a fair manner.  Is 

23

that right? 

24
25

 MR. FEIGIN: 

No, Your Honor, I don't think 

that that's precisely what they hold.  I think the most

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

salient distinction between those cases and this one is 

2

that none of those cases address a tax that was 

3

justified on the basis of the taxpayer's domicile as the 

4

Maryland county income tax is. 

5

 In Gwin and Greyhound, the Court didn't even 

6

address any argument that the tax was based on domicile. 

7

And in J.D. Adams, although the highest court in Indiana 

8

had  believed that the tax was justified on the basis 

9

of domicile, this Court looked at the structure of the 

10

tax and concluded that it wasn't  that that 

11

justification didn't actually fit the tax. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

When you say  it seems 

13

a little bit of hairsplitting.  You say it's a test on 

14

residency, but not income.  But we have previously said 

15

a tax on sleeping, measured by the number of pairs of 

16

shoes you have in your closet, is a tax on shoes.  So 

17

you can call it residency, but if it's still using 

18

income as its basis as opposed to property values or 

19

whatever else these residency taxes are based on, then 

20

why isn't it a tax on income? 

21

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Let me be as clear as I can, 

22

Your Honor.  It is a tax on income, but the 

23

jurisdictional rationale for the tax is different from 

24

the jurisdictional rationales employed by the states. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that's a due process

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argument.  The question here is whether or not a number 

2

of States impose taxes like this it would be additional 

3

burden on interstate commerce. 

4
5
6
7
8
9
10

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, first of all, Your Honor, 

if every State 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I mean, that is the 

question, isn't it? 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

Yes, I think that is part of 

the analysis of the question. 
 But if every State enacted an income tax 

11

that looked exactly like Maryland's county income tax, 

12

that applies one uniform rate no matter where income is 

13

earned, every U.S. citizen would pay income tax at the 

14

exact same rate no matter where they earned their 

15

income. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Except if they also 

17

imposed the special nonresident tax, and that changes 

18

the whole scenario. 

19

 MR. FEIGIN: 

20

 In addition to what I said to Justice Kagan 

21

about that earlier, let me add a further thought, that 

22

if you really thought there was a problem with the 

23

interaction of resident and nonresident taxes then I 

24

think it would probably be much more logical to locate 

25

the problem in the nonresident tax rather than the

That's right, Your Honor. 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

resident tax, for three reasons. 
 First, the nonresident tax is the only one 

3

that's triggered by economic activity that crosses State 

4

lines.  Maryland's county income tax applies whether the 

5

business is done in State or out of State. 

6

 Second, any differential incentives that a 

7

taxpayer might have to do business in one State versus 

8

another aren't arising from the county income tax, which 

9

applies evenly, but instead from the differential tax 

10

rates that various other States which their nonresidents 

11

might have.  So Illinois might impose a 3 percent rate, 

12

Idaho a 5 percent rate, and Iowa an 8 percent rate. 

13

 And the third thing is that the resident tax 

14

is the only one that the taxpayers actually have some 

15

political power to get in there and to influence. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

In your answer that you 

17

gave to my  the hypothetical of 100 percent, that 

18

would be a burden on 100 percent of interstate commerce, 

19

because a resident who did not go into interstate 

20

commerce would pay less, so there is a burden.  All 

21

you're saying is, well, if there's going to be a burden, 

22

it could be a great big one. 

23

 MR. FEIGIN: 

So, Your Honor, there is  in 

24

some cases, a Maryland resident will be taxed more on 

25

commerce that they conduct outside of Maryland then

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inside of Maryland, but I don't see why that's 

2

discrimination attributable to Maryland.  It arises from 

3

the combination of the income taxes of two States. 

4

 And I think for the reasons I was just 

5

explaining to the Chief Justice, one could file a 

6

perhaps more persuasive brief challenging the 

7

nonresident tax which the Maryland taxpayers exposed and 

8

that's not a reason for invalidating the uniform 

9

residence tax. 

10
11
12

 And, Justice Breyer, if I can get back to 
your point. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Justice Kennedy asked a 

13

question I was curious about that.  I wanted you to 

14

address that specifically, and you're just trying to say 

15

who's at fault.  I don't know who's at fault. 

16

Switzerland has a tax on milk from cows that are 

17

pastured at less than 5,000 feet.  It's Belgium's fault. 

18

They don't have any mountains. 

19

 (Laughter.) 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21
22

I mean, I don't know who's 

at fault, but that is a discriminatory tariff. 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, I've 

23

explained to explains why if someone has to be at fault, 

24

I think it's the nonresident tax.  But let me explain 

25

why I think 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't see anybody at 

2

fault.  Actually in the corporate area it was a tax on 

3

gross income in that first case, and so I don't know why 

4

human beings  well, no, I won't go into that issue. 

5

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, it wasn't 

6

Your Honor, just quickly on J.D. Adams, in addition to 

7

it not being a domicilebased tax, it was a tax on gross 

8

receipts, which are taxes on transactions and the entire 

9

revenue of those transactions.  But let me explain why I 

10

think neither tax here 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, just to understand 

12

what you said a minute ago, are you saying that if this 

13

same claim were brought by a nonresident challenging the 

14

nonresident tax in Maryland that would succeed? 

15

 MR. FEIGIN: 

No, Your Honor.  I'm saying it 

16

would be a stronger claim.  But let me try to explain 

17

now why I think both taxes can peacefully coexist. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  So that was 

19

irrelevant, then., the fact that it would be  it would 

20

be a stronger claim, but also a bad one at the end? 

21

 MR. FEIGIN: 

No, Your Honor, I don't think 

22

it's irrelevant.  I think it's quite relevant because 

23

the only tax that Respondents have paid and the only one 

24

they are challenging is the evenhanded residential 

25

income tax, and the existence of this other tax that

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could be perceived to have an undesirable affect 

2

shouldn't affect the validity of the tax they've 

3

actually challenged.  But let me explain 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But they are 

5

linked  they are linked together.  I mean, the special 

6

nonresident tax is set at a particular level in relation 

7

to the county tax.  It is obviously intended to reach 

8

nonresidents in a way that the county tax reaches 

9

residents.  I'm not sure you can artificially separate 

10
11

them. 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Maryland has upheld the 

12

special nonresident tax, not on the ground that it's not 

13

discriminatory.  The Maryland courts recognize the 

14

special nonresident tax as discriminatory, which the 

15

county income tax clearly is not, and they've upheld it 

16

under this Court's compensatory tax doctrine.  Whether 

17

the Maryland courts were right on that or whether they 

18

wrong on that, I don't think it should affect the 

19

validity of the county income tax, which is the question 

20

presented in this case. 

21

 But the reason I think that nonresident 

22

taxes can peacefully coexist with resident taxes is that 

23

although they are both income taxes, they are on 

24

distinct jurisdictional rationales, and when two taxes 

25

are imposed on the same value based on distinct

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jurisdictional rationales, it's not impermissible double 

2

taxation under the Commerce Clause, and let me give an 

3

example. 

4

 If an operation manufactures all of its 

5

widgets in State A and sells them all in State B, it's 

6

clear under this Court's decisions in McGoldrick v. 

7

BerwindWhite Coal Mining Company and Armco v. Hardesty 

8

that State A can impose a manufacturing tax that is 

9

measured by the value of the revenue of the sales even 

10

though the sales occur in State B.  And State B can 

11

impose a gross receipts tax on the sales that occur in 

12

State B which is paid by the seller, the mining company 

13

or the widget manufacturer in my example, which is also 

14

taxed on that same value, the taxes that occur in State 

15

B. 

16

 The reason that's permissible is because 

17

they're distinct jurisdictional rationales, which is 

18

what we have here.  One is a tax based on the residency 

19

and the other is tax based on doing business in the 

20

State. 

21

 Previous apportionment cases this Court has 

22

considered have all involved the second rationale, doing 

23

business in the State.  And in that circumstance, it 

24

makes sense to try to divide up the pie because you 

25

don't want California asserting, well, we're responsible

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for 90 percent of your income, and Oregon says, we're 

2

also responsible for 90 percent of your income.  But 

3

there's no real way to compare apples and oranges and to 

4

say that a residencybased tax is better or worse than a 

5

tax based on doing business there.  And so you don't 

6

have the same conflict between the taxes and have to 

7

divide up the pie in the same way that this Court's 

8

previous cases have suggested. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Feigin, if we were to 

10

rule against Maryland, how many States are in the same 

11

position as Maryland, either because they do a county 

12

tax themselves or because they allow local jurisdictions 

13

to impose their own taxes? 

14

 MR. FEIGIN: 

I'd look at pages 17 to 18 of 

15

the Municipal Lawyers Association brief, Your Honor, but 

16

if I could add just one quick sentence beyond that. 

17

Even States that do offer credits of the kind Respondent 

18

is seeking would be affected by a decision in this case 

19

because it would constitutionalize that requirement and 

20

create constitutional questions about whether a credit 

21

 when a credit is required. 

22

 Thank you.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

credits for all foreign income tax paid and do you think

26

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

it must do so? 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

There are limits.  It does 

3

offer a foreign income tax credit.  There are some 

4

treaties about this, I believe, but I don't think 

5

there's any overarching principle of international 

6

law 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

In and of itself, it 

8

wouldn't violate the negative foreign commerce clause, 

9

right? 

10

 (Laughter.) 

11

 MR. FEIGIN: 

12

Congress could legislate that out of existence.

 Mr. Perella. 

16

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOMINIC F. PERELLA 

17
18
19
20

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. PERELLA: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 Justice Alito, you asked my friend on the 

21

other side whether it's correct to say that if you 

22

perform  you know, if you look at the real economic 

23

analysis of this tax and see what it does to interstate 

24

commerce, whether it amounts to a tariff, and my 

25

opponent conceded that it does.

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 A tariff is the quintessential unlawful tax 

2

under the dormant commerce clause and I'd like to 

3

illustrate why by pointing to Justice Breyer's hot dog 

4

stand.  Again, as my opponent on the other side 

5

conceded, a small business like a hot dog stand could 

6

operate in two different States.  It might not be 

7

California and Hawaii, but wherever it might be, and it 

8

would be exposed to 100 percent double taxation.  The 

9

only limitation would be the rate that the State chooses 

10

to set on that.  And that would apply  and I would 

11

point the Court to page 5 of the Council on State 

12

Taxation brief  that would apply to 90 percent of the 

13

businesses in this country. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

When you do business in 

15

California and you live somewhere else, your hot dog 

16

stand is going to be subject to pretty high property 

17

taxes.  It's going to be subject to special use taxes. 

18

It's going to be subject to taxes that they have for one 

19

time to finance the schools.  It's going to be subject 

20

to da, da, da, da, da.  Okay?  And so what they are 

21

really saying is, well, nobody claims that California 

22

can't do that and Maryland can ignore it for purposes of 

23

their income tax.  It's tough to do business in 

24

California, according to some.  Not to Californians. 

25

 But nonetheless, this is just one more

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

burden that you have to suffer and that's because 

2

they're on  you heard the argument.  So what's your 

3

response to that. 

4

 MR. PERELLA: 

My response is that in cases 

5

like Container Corp., Jefferson Lines, and others, this 

6

Court has said:  Look, we can't and don't want to 

7

constitutionalize everything about State taxation. 

8

Different States impose different taxes, impose 

9

different burdens, and we're not going to try to stop 

10

them from doing so.  We can't stop them.  They have that 

11

power.  But the line we're going to draw, and it's the 

12

line the internal consistency test draws, is that we're 

13

not going to allow States to structure their taxes so 

14

that they are taxing more than one  they're exposing 

15

income to more than 100 percent of the tax base. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Perella, suppose we 

17

had a Maryland resident and all that resident's income 

18

is earned out of State.  And each of the States where 

19

the income is earned tax at or above the Maryland rate. 

20

That would mean, I suppose, that the Maryland resident 

21

owes nothing to Maryland because he could take a credit 

22

for all what he's  leaving the residents without 

23

anything, without a penny from this resident who may 

24

have five children that he sends to school in Maryland. 

25

 MR. PERELLA: 

Justice Ginsburg, a couple of

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

responses to that.  Firstly, I agree that it can happen. 

2

I think it happens rarely.  And just as a practical 

3

matter, let me point out Maryland has reciprocal 

4

agreements with its surrounding jurisdictions 

5

Washington, Virginia, Pennsylvania, et cetera  where 

6

they say we're going to ignore commuting of that sort 

7

and we're going to tax people at their residence. 

8

 But even if that weren't so, I think the key 

9

point here is that that resident is paying substantial 

10

taxes to State B, and residents of State B who happen to 

11

do work in the State in Maryland are paying substantial 

12

taxes to Maryland.  So this comes out in the wash. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Maybe  no, maybe so, and 

14

maybe  maybe not so.  Why can't  suppose not many 

15

other people in  in  in Maryland are in  in this 

16

position, or the reverse?  This  this man is getting a 

17

free ride. 

18

 MR. PERELLA: 

Well, I disagree respectfully, 

19

Justice Kennedy, that he's getting a free ride.  I mean, 

20

he's paying, first of all, again, substantial income 

21

taxes to the other States where the income is earned. 

22

He's paying substantial property taxes. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But he's getting a free 

ride off Maryland school.  Now he rents the property. 
 MR. PERELLA: 

Two answers.  First of all, I

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think important to point out that 42 other States don't 

2

seem to have found this problematic.  Maryland is an 

3

outlier here, and the other States are not here to 

4

defend its rule. 

5

 But I also think it's worth mentioning that, 

6

yes, there will be occasional cases where a State 

7

resident does not pay any tax to the 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9

tax imposed on a resident? 

10

 MR. PERELLA: 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Can there be some minimum 

Minimum 
In Justice Ginsburg's 

12

hypothetical, 100 percent of the income is earned from 

13

out of State, and has five kids go to school, and they 

14

use all of the local facilities.  Can Maryland impose 

15

any tax based on residence? 

16

 MR. PERELLA: 

I think the short answer to 

17

that is if it's an income tax, no, under your 

18

hypothetical, which is that he earns no income inside 

19

the State. 

20

 But this Court has, you know 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22
23

What about a school support 

tax? 
 MR. PERELLA: 

You know, I think that it's 

24

possible that you could impose a school support tax, but 

25

then what 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you give me the right 

2

numbers in what you said?  We've heard different ones. 

3

You just said how many States provide a credit such that 

4

a resident has to pay the higher of the foreign State's 

5

tax on its business there, or the State's tax on income. 

6

You said 40 States impose some kind of credit like that, 

7

roughly? 

8

 MR. PERELLA: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10
11
12
13

 MR. PERELLA: 

No, Justice Breyer 
What? 
 to be clear, every other 

State has a credit, a full credit unlike the one 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So every other State.  How 

many are the every other State? 

14

 MR. PERELLA: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's 42 States. 
42 States.  How many States 

16

are in the position of Maryland where they don't impose 

17

a credit  or they do not grant a credit for some or 

18

all of the income? 

19

 MR. PERELLA: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MR. PERELLA: 

Zero. 
Zero? 
Wisconsin has a limitation on 

22

its credit as one of the topside briefs points out.  The 

23

limitation has to do with whether they credit taxes paid 

24

to localities in other States, but Maryland is the only 

25

State that limits its credit in this way.

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Maryland does 
Well, don't some States 

3

allow localities to impose taxes that do not give a 

4

credit?  So, for example, the New York City income tax 

5

would be the classic example of that. 

6

 MR. PERELLA: 

Yes.  Justice Kagan, as  as 

7

my opponent on the other side said, the IMLA brief 

8

catalogs some foreign localities that impose local 

9

income taxes.  Some of them don't appear to have a 

10

credit. 

11

 But I think it's important to point out, and 

12

we did in our responsive brief, that the IMLA's math is 

13

substantially exaggerated.  I mean, for example, they've 

14

pointed to  a lot of the local taxes they point to are 

15

in Pennsylvania.  Thousands of them in fact.  And 

16

they're simply wrong about Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania 

17

imposes a credit.  It just happens to be codified in the 

18

State statutes.  And the same thing is true with Kansas. 

19

They say Kansas is an example.  Kansas only imposes an 

20

intangibles tax which operates 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you recognize that 

22

there are jurisdictions, local jurisdictions, that 

23

impose a tax and don't give a credit? 

24

 MR. PERELLA: 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I think it's fair 
Just like this one.

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. PERELLA: 

I think it's fair to say that 

2

there are some.  I think it's also fair to say that the 

3

number is substantially lower. 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But before you said there 

were zero. 
 MR. PERELLA: 

No, sorry, Justice Ginsburg. 

7

I said that there are no States that don't impose 

8

that don't allow the full credit on other States' income 

9

taxes. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, Maryland does allow 

11

the credit against the State income tax.  It's just the 

12

county tax. 

13

 MR. PERELLA: 

Well, I mean, not to split 

14

hairs, but as this case comes to the Court, you know, 

15

the State courts have held, and Maryland hasn't 

16

disputed, that this is, in fact, a State income tax. 

17

The court held that in Frey case in the Maryland Court 

18

of Appeals. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes.  But they  the 

20

lion's share of it would be this State part, not the 

21

county part.  And on that, Maryland does give a credit. 

22

 MR. PERELLA: 

I think the key point here is 

23

that if you conceive of this all as a State tax, which 

24

is how, again, how the Maryland law stands and how the 

25

case comes to the Court, what Maryland has done here is

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say we're going to arbitrarily cut our credit 

2

essentially in half.  We're going to give you half the 

3

credit. 

4

 Now, some of the topside briefs, the IMLA 

5

brief, for example, make an issue of that.  They say, 

6

hey, this is just a rational compromise; we're going 

7

part way.  But the rule Maryland suggests is not a 

8

compromise.  The rule they suggest is you can impose 

9

complete double taxation.  And it's a rule 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Perella, you're not 

11

saying that we have to or that we should establish a 

12

priority rule as to different taxing schemes, do  are 

13

you?  You're not saying it has to be sourcebased over 

14

residencebased, or  or vice versa? 

15

 MR. PERELLA: 

I think that the holdings of 

16

this Court in Standard Oil, Mobil Oil, Central Railroad, 

17

are that in a situation where one State is taxing on the 

18

basis of residency and the other on the basis of source, 

19

it is the State of residency that yields. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

21

that's the priority rule. 

22
23

 MR. PERELLA: 

So you are saying that 

Well, I'm saying that in the 

case where there is the risk of overlap, yes. 

24

 Now, the other side has construed our brief 

25

saying that we're requiring apportionment, right?  The

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whole point of their reply brief is how can it be that 

2

the due process cases say you tax everything wherever 

3

earned, and the Commerce Clause requires you to tax 

4

nothing outside the State.  I want to just be clear that 

5

that's not the rule we're suggesting. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, let me ask you:  I 

7

mean, suppose we were to say what Maryland is doing is 

8

not okay, but then States could choose.  Some would do a 

9

sourcebased tax, some would do a residencybased tax. 

10

And if you had a situation like that, it seems it could 

11

lead to double taxation in exactly this kind of way.  If 

12

you were living in the wrong State and all of a sudden 

13

the combination of one State having a pure sourcebased 

14

and one State having a pure residencybased tax was 

15

going to lead to double taxation.  Why is that any 

16

different? 

17

 MR. PERELLA: 

So I think that if you had 

18

that situation, and of course you don't because all the 

19

States do this the same way, but if you had it, I think 

20

there would be an argument to be made that that tax 

21

would be unconstitutional because it would produce 

22

massive double taxation.  And, you know, the Court has 

23

said residency yields in that situation. 

24
25

 But I want to be clear that this is a much 
easier case.  Here we have a situation where the tax is

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

simply not internally consistent.  And, Justice 

2

Sotomayor, to answer your question earlier, there's 

3

there's no way to argue that it is.  And Maryland to 

4

this  to this day refuses to actually apply the test. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But it's only 

6

internally inconsistent because of the special 

7

nonresident tax.  And your  your clients don't pay the 

8

special nonresidents tax, so why should we worry about 

9

it in this case? 

10

 MR. PERELLA: 

The reason you have to worry 

11

about it in this case  and let me say, Mr. Chief 

12

Justice, there are other ways to  to rule in our favor 

13

without doing internal consistency.  But if that's the 

14

approach that you take, the only way the internal 

15

consistency test makes any sense is if you look at both 

16

the residence tax  you know, the inbound tax and the 

17

outbound tax.  Because the whole point of the test, as 

18

the economists' brief points out, is to look at what 

19

happens when two States have the power to tax, one on 

20

the basis of residence and one on the basis of source. 

21

 So to suggest that you would only look at 

22

the inbound piece makes nonsense of the test.  That's 

23

not how it's ever been applied.  I'd like to 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

A resident  you're not 

disputing the proposition that the State of residence

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can tax worldwide income, can impose an income tax on 

2

its residents worldwide, wherever they earn it.  You're 

3

not questioning that proposition. 

4

 MR. PERELLA: 

5

matter of due process. 

6

I'm not questioning that as a 

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, as a matter of 

7

what?  Would you question it as a matter of a dormant 

8

Commerce Clause, that the State of residence can tax 

9

worldwide income? 

10

 MR. PERELLA: 

Would I question it as a 

11

matter of the Commerce Clause?  I think the gravamen of 

12

our position, Justice Ginsburg, is that States have the 

13

raw power, right, putting aside all other factors and 

14

all other States' taxes, to reach their residents' 

15

income wherever earned.  But the Commerce Clause 

16

operates to force them to structure their taxes in a way 

17

that avoids double taxation. 

18

 Now, there will be 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, then what you're 

20

saying is they don't have the power to tax worldwide 

21

income 

22

 MR. PERELLA: 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

No, that 
 if another State has a 

24

tax based on source.  So, going in proposition, they can 

25

tax worldwide income, is subject to what other States

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do, and if other States have a tax, then the resident's 

2

State has to recede. 

3

 MR. PERELLA: 

Two answers to that, Justice 

4

Ginsburg.  First, under our position, which is not 

5

something we've invented for purposes of this case, but 

6

is the steady holding of this Court for 80 years, the 

7

question is not what other States are actually doing. 

8

The question is whether Maryland's tax is structured in 

9

such a way that eliminates the pervasive risk of double 

10

taxation. 

11

 Because, of course, as the Chief  as  as 

12

the Chief Justice pointed out in the opening argument, 

13

other States can exercise their right to tax on the 

14

basis of source to any degree.  And so what this Court 

15

has said is we're not going to make the 

16

constitutionality of the tax turn on the shifting 

17

incidents of the other 49 States.  We're going to 

18

require that you structure your tax so you're not going 

19

to open the door to all this double taxation. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You talked about what 

21

this Court has been doing for I don't know how many 

22

years.  Have we ever had a case under the Dormant 

23

Commerce Clause where a resident is complaining, an 

24

insider is complaining.  The Dormant Commerce Clause 

25

cases involved outsiders who are saying, this State

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where I don't vote is imposing something arbitrary on 

2

me.  Here we have an instate person complaining under 

3

the Dormant Commerce Clause that its State is 

4

discriminating against it. 

5
6

 Is there any other State where  case where 
it's an insider complaining 

7

 MR. PERELLA: 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

9
10

Yes. 
 rather than an 

outsider? 
 MR. PERELLA: 

There are  there are a 

11

number of cases, and let me give them to you.  Boston 

12

Stock Exchange, for starters, is a resident complaining 

13

about their own tax.  The complete audit  or the 

14

Commerce Clause was imposed.  Goldberg is the same, 

15

although you ruled against the taxpayer in that case; 

16

the test was applied.  And most importantly, I think, 

17

J.D. Adams, Gwin and Central Greyhound are all 

18

domiciliaries.  Now, they are, of course, corporations. 

19

 But my opponent, I don't think, has offered 

20

any rationale to distinguish between the two.  The 

21

question this Court has always identified is:  Is this 

22

tax double taxing 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, one thing, one 

24

obvious distinction is the corporation doesn't have five 

25

children to send to school.

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. PERELLA: 

Well, you know, I think that 

2

that rationale maybe proves a little bit too much. 

3

Because, of course, corporations do receive an awful lot 

4

of benefits from their domiciliary States, and 

5

especially the States where they have their principal 

6

place of business.  And I would argue, although there's 

7

no, you know, empirical evidence in the record, that 

8

they probably use more in the way of services  fire, 

9

water, structure, legal, you know, legal mechanisms, 

10

et cetera  and yet this Court has said, you absolutely 

11

cannot double tax and it's forbidden. 

12

 And, you know, again, Maryland is  the 

13

only distinguishing factor they have for those cases 

14

and actually this is an important point I would like to 

15

address  the only point either Maryland or the United 

16

States has used to distinguish J.D. Adams and the like 

17

is the idea that the tax in those cases was on gross 

18

receipts. 

19

 That argument has been long since 

20

foreclosed.  This Court held in Moorman, both the 

21

majority and the concurring opinion, that there is no 

22

analytical difference between net and gross income in 

23

this area. 

24
25

 And furthermore, in Westinghouse v. Tully, 
the Court said, look, there's no difference for our

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

analysis between the tax and  a burdensome tax imposed 

2

on interstate transactions and a burdensome tax 

3

excuse me  a burdensome tax imposed on interstate 

4

income.  They said it cannot be, quote/unquote, that you 

5

can impose that unlawful burden by doing it in the 

6

aggregate. 

7
8
9

 And so I think the idea that that 
distinguishes our cases is not available to them. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Perella, we said in this 

10

American Trucking case, we said we were going to allow 

11

States to impose a neutral, local tax even though it 

12

violated internal consistency. 

13

 Why shouldn't we see this as pretty 

14

equivalent to American Trucking?  In other words, a 

15

State saying, we're going to impose a small tax to 

16

ensure that you are paying for some of the very basic 

17

services that we provide. 

18

 MR. PERELLA: 

Well, I guess several 

19

responses, Justice Kagan.  First of all, there's nothing 

20

small about this tax.  Maryland is imposing, by their 

21

own lights, $50 million in double taxation on its local 

22

businesses annually when they operate across State 

23

lines. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm sure that if you 

aggregate the American Trucking tax, it was a lot of

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

money, too. 
 MR. PERELLA: 

Maybe.  The distinction 

3

that  that Justice Breyer drew for the Court in that 

4

case was that in American Trucking it was a fee.  It was 

5

a flat fee and it was imposed only on intrastate 

6

transactions.  He said no interstate transactions, no 

7

interstate commerce appears to be at issue in this case. 

8

 In this case, by striking contrast, Maxim, 

9

the S corporation that earned this income, operates 

10

essentially in every State in the country.  And, of 

11

course, under S corporation principles, the income that 

12

the Wynnes earned through that is  passed through income 

13

just like a partnership. 

14

 And furthermore, you know, if you look at 

15

the  how the tax affects other State residents, again, 

16

90 percent of businesses in this country are organized 

17

as passthrough entities or sole proprietorships.  And so 

18

you have all of that income crossing State lines, and 

19

every time it does, there's a tariff, there's a barrier 

20

at the State lines that says you're going to pay twice. 

21

And this Court has never, I don't think, approved a tax 

22

like that.  American Trucking certainly did not. 

23

 I'd like to  to mention a couple of other 

24

things.  The IMLA brief and Maryland's reply brief 

25

suggest that if you accept our position, Maryland has no

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

choice but to make its tax code more  regressiveI'd 

2

just like to point out that that's not so.  Maryland, to 

3

take just one example, could raise the top marginal 

4

income tax rate to close the gap.  That would impose the 

5

difference only on, you know, higher income citizens and 

6

it would not double tax anyone.  The thing that 

7

Maryland 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
comfort? 

10

(Laughter.) 


11

JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12
13
14
15
16
17

Why should that give me 


What difference does that 


make? 
MR. PERELLA: 

Well, I don't think it 


makes 
JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Where the only way out is 


to  is to  I don't understand the argument. 
 MR. PERELLA: 

Justice Scalia, Maryland can 

18

close the gap however it likes.  It can raise the 

19

property tax 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

 MR. PERELLA: 

That's what I think. 
It can raise the income tax 

22

generally.  The point that I wanted to make is that if 

23

the suggestion is that this tax is somehow unfair 

24

because, as a  as a necessary result you're going to 

25

soak people with lower incomes, that's simply not so.

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That's not what Maryland has to do to the fix the 

2

problem here. 

3

 And, again, this is a problem that only 

4

Maryland has.  Every other State with an income tax 

5

allows the credit in full. 

6

 Let me also mention another argument 

7

Maryland makes in its reply.  It suggests that 

8

S corporation owners or S corporations should not be 

9

heard to complain about double taxation because 

10

C corporations are double taxed.  That misunderstands 

11

the concept of double taxation in Commerce Clause cases. 

12

In a C corporation, you have the first tax imposed on 

13

the, you know, the corporation itself, and then down the 

14

line you have a tax imposed either by the same State or 

15

another on the  on the person who's getting a 

16

dividend. 

17

 That's not the same person being taxed 

18

twice, nor is it anyone being taxed twice for crossing 

19

State lines.  And so both the dividends recipient and 

20

corporation are indifferent to where they live and where 

21

they work.  There's no double taxation there in the 

22

sense of the hydraulic pull, pulling the commerce into 

23

single State.  And in fact, in that respect, it's just 

24

like Jefferson Lines.  In that opinion, this Court said, 

25

"The reason this is different from Central Greyhound and

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the only reason we're not striking this tax down is 

2

because the first incidence falls on the bus ticket 

3

buyer, and the second incidence falls on the bus 

4

company.  And so no one discouraged from crossing state 

5

lines."  That's not how the Maryland tax operates. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What if they didn't do 

7

it on gross income, but just said every resident has to 

8

pay X amount? 

9

 MR. PERELLA: 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

 MR. PERELLA: 

12
13

As an income tax? 
As an income tax. 
I think the result would be 

the same. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It's not being based on 

14

gross income.  Just says every resident has to pay 

15

$1,000. 

16

 MR. PERELLA: 

Justice Sotomayor, I think the 

17

result would be the same because  and as I stand here, 

18

I'm thinking about this  I believe it would be the 

19

same because the question would be, as the Chief Justice 

20

points out, is the tax internally consistent.  And, you 

21

know, that sounds obscure but all it's really saying is, 

22

is that tax creating a risk of pervasive double taxation 

23

for anyone who does interstate commerce. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But why doesn't Justice 

Sotomayor's hypothetical, isn't it exactly the same as

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the American Trucking hypothetical?  You just 

2

distinguished the flat tax versus the percentage income 

3

tax.  I thought that that was your principal distinction 

4

of American Trucking. 

5

 MR. PERELLA: 

I think  I think that the 

6

thing about American Trucking that made it unique, 

7

Justice Kagan, and I confess I don't completely 

8

understand the rationale of American Trucking, but I 

9

think the thing that makes it unique is that it's a flat fee 

10

for use of the State services.  That's what Justice 

11

Breyer said to the Court in that case. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I thought that that was what 

13

Justice Sotomayor was positing, a flat fee for use of 

14

the State schools and everything else that comes along 

15

with being a State resident. 

16

 MR. PERELLA: 

All right.  Well, perhaps, 

17

then, you know, maybe that tax could survive under the 

18

rationale ofAmerican Trucking too.  But, again, I think 

19

it's important to point out this is not that case.  I 

20

mean, this is a case where it's clearly an income tax. 

21

It's clearly pegged to, you know, adjusted gross income 

22

and it clearly does not offer the credit that every 

23

other State offers. 

24

 And, you know, I think just to illustrate 

25

how this  how this functions in reality, the other

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

side suggests, well, this is just some sort of  we're 

2

asking for a special benefit for  for, you know, 

3

people who own these big interstate companies.  If you 

4

own, for example, an independent taxi and you happen to 

5

take rides, give people rides across the line into 

6

Delaware and Pennsylvania, you're going to be double 

7

taxed, under their theory, on any piece of that commerce 

8

that can be taxed by Pennsylvania or Delaware.  Whereas, 

9

the exact same operation that happens to be an 

10

incorporated bus company could not be constitutionally 

11

double taxed. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But, you know, there 

13

there's an inequity either way.  The inequity on the 

14

other side is you have two neighbors side by side. 

15

Their kids both use the school.  One of the neighbors 

16

makes most of his income out of the State and you want 

17

to say that would not be taxable, whereas the other 

18

neighbor makes all of the income in the State and pays a 

19

very high, very high tax.  You know, that's not fair 

20

either, is it? 

21

 MR. PERELLA: 

Three responses, if I could, 

22

Justice Scalia.  First response, as I mentioned earlier, 

23

it's going to work the other way as well.  If you look 

24

at this across 50 States without State lines, as you're 

25

supposed to for Commerce Clause purposes, people who are

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

nonresidents are going to be paying taxes into the 

2

State. 

3

 Secondly, even if there is some inequity 

4

there, the lodestar of this Court's Commerce Clause 

5

cases has always been that whatever else you do, you 

6

can't create the substantial nationwide risk of double 

7

taxation.  So that has to be the first principle. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's quite 

interesting, because New York City's normal population, 

10

I think now we have gone down to 7 million, but 

11

outofstate residents that come in are 25 million a 

12

day, who work in the city.  So, New York's 7 million 

13

pays for those 25 million. 

14

 MR. PERELLA: 

I'm not sure totally sure how 

15

the New York City income tax regime works, Justice 

16

Sotomayor, but I think the point I was driving at is, 

17

you know, States have different policy preferences.  You 

18

know, they want to have a tax on this and a tax on that, 

19

that's almost always 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MR. PERELLA: 

22
23

What's your third? 
Yes, that's what I was getting 

the line is drawn at the idea that you can't double tax. 
 And the third point I was going to make is, 

24

you know, Maryland is complaining about a very small cab 

25

of limitation that this Court always enforced on their

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

taxing power.  And as this Court has said in a number of 

2

decisions dating all the way back to Chief Justice 

3

Marshall, States have some limitations on what they can 

4

do with taxation under the Commerce Clause, but what 

5

they bought in exchange for, you know, agreeing to those 

6

limitations in the Constitution is a nationwide network 

7

of commerce.  They don't have barriers at State lines, 

8

there are no tariffs as Maryland admitted this functions 

9

as.  They can  you know, they can take advantage of 

10

that nationwide network and they can market their goods 

11

and they can market their employees in any State in the 

12

country and vice versa.  And so I think the idea that 

13

this is a oneway ratchet and that Maryland is only 

14

losing in this proposition is not correct. 

15

 And just as a final matter, let me just say, 

16

with respect to the idea that residency is a 

17

getoutofjailfree card, I'd like to quote Chief 

18

Justice Marshall from Brown v. Maryland.  "The 

19

distinction between the tax on the thing imported and on 

20

the person of the importer can have no influence on this 

21

part of the subject.  It is too obvious for controversy 

22

that they interfere equally with the power to regulate 

23

commerce." 

24

 I think that's the bottom line here. 

25

the Court has no further questions, I'll submit.

Thank you, counsel. 

2

Mr. Brockman, you have three minutes remaining. 

3

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. BROCKMAN 

4
5

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. BROCKMAN: 

Thank you.  The bottom line 

6

is not that a tax on the thing is the same as a tax on 

7

the person.  That is true in the trilogy of cases that 

8

the Wynnes mostly rely on, the J.D. Adams cases where the 

9

gross receipts tax is understood, at least at that time, 

10

to be very different from a net income tax going all the 

11

way back to 1918 in U.S. Glue.  And the reason was 

12

because it was viewed as taxing the transaction itself. 

13

The net income from the transaction is different.  It's 

14

the thing that the person receives and enjoys in their 

15

home State.  And people choose to live in States for 

16

reasons different from the ones that they consider when 

17

they choose to do business elsewhere.  They may choose 

18

because there are lower property taxes relative to sales 

19

taxes, as in Maryland. 

20

 Maryland is not unique. 

The Chief Justice 

21

can probably correct me if I'm wrong about the number, 

22

but there are 92 counties in Indiana and they all impose 

23

a local income tax.  None offers a credit.  So  and 

24

and the fact that other States aren't here is just a 

25

harbinger because if this becomes a constitutional rule,

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they will be. 

2

 The reason we have offered a compromise and 

3

why it is a compromise, is because  because this tax 

4

falls on the State's own residents, they have the 

5

capacity to change it.  That's always been an important 

6

consideration from McCullough all the way through United 

7

Haulers.  And the norm that  that supposedly prefers 

8

source to  to residents as a basis is nowhere to be 

9

found.  It's  it's a norm only.  And in Bernard v. 

10

Brooks, in answer to Your Honor's question, this Court 

11

said that the United States has never believed that when 

12

it decides to limit its own sovereign taxing power over 

13

its own residents that it's doing it because it has to. 

14

It's never been thought that.  And the States could not 

15

have thought that when they were joining the union, that 

16

the unique relationship between a State and its own 

17

residents would be  could not be accounted for in the 

18

State's tax system, that the Constitution would 

19

determine how, as Mr. Perella says, the States can 

20

structure their own taxes. 

21

 Maryland made some choices and they ought to 

22

be able to make the choices they did.  They said that 

23

the taxes one pays to the county should not be different 

24

based on factors that the county services are 

25

indifferent to.  You don't get 18 percent of  of a

fire truck or a day of school because you earned 70 

2

82 percent elsewhere.  You get 100 percent just like 

3

your neighbor does. 

4

 And in that respect, the reason the rates do 

5

matter and the reason you should nevertheless be very 

6

uncomfortable about it is because under the rule that 

7

they're proposing, Maryland's tax system is at the mercy 

8

of the other State's taxes.  In the foldout section of 

9

the Joint Appendix at page 77, you see there are 39 

10

jurisdictions, there's a 40th not shown there that taxed 

11

a portion of the income.  27 of them taxed it at a 

12

higher rate than the Maryland and Howard County tax 

13

combined in 2006.  So  thank you, Your Honor.
