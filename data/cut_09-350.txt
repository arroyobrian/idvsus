CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 09-350, Los Angeles County v. Humphries.
Mr. Coates.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COATES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Monell v. Department of Social Services,

11

this Court held there could be no liability against a

12

local public entity under section 1983 unless the

13

plaintiff proved causation, namely that the injury that

14

was inflicted was inflicted as a result of a custom,

15

policy, or practice of that local public entity.

16

The Ninth Circuit, however, in this case has

17

imposed ex post facto declaratory relief on the County

18

of Los Angeles as well as a substantial fee award, while

19

acknowledging that it has not, in fact, determined

20

whether the injury suffered by the plaintiffs and

21

subject to declaratory relief was the result of a

22

policy, custom, or practice fairly attributable to the

23

County of Los Angeles.

24

Circuit has developed a digression from the Court's

25

jurisprudence in Monell; namely, in the Ninth Circuit,

It did so because the Ninth

3

Alderson Reporting Company

1

claims for prospective relief, both injunctive and

2

declaratory relief, are not subject to the Monell

3

requirements.

4

We submit that this is flatly inconsistent

5

with Monell and erodes the important principles of

6

federalism that are the motivating factors for the

7

Monell causation requirement.

MR. COATES:

As to the County, it's $58,000.

But the overall award is far above that, and that's just

18

for appellate attorneys' fees.

Yes, yes.

maintain the statute.

If you sue the

I suppose.

You could

of 1983?

You could sue that

21

that a State agent or a municipality can continue to

22

ignore a constitutional violation until, what -- you're

23

denied the license five times?

24

MR. COATES:

Well, no.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How many times do you

Alderson Reporting Company

have to show that you're not getting a license you're

2

3

MR. COATES:

Well, say, for example, that

4

one brought to the attention of a policymaking official

5

that this is what was going on -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
that -­

They wouldn't know

MR. COATES: -- and then you have the
deliberate indifference by a policymaking official.

10

submit that, under Monell, that might provide a basis

11

under the Court's case law.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

I

So what do

13

you do with CANRA section 11178(a)(2), which tells you

14

that the municipality is responsible for the accuracy,

15

completeness, and retention of the reports sent to the

16

State?

17

It's not your policy to ignore your

18

obligation and not figure out what to do about the

19

retention of improperly submitted names?

20

MR. COATES:

Well, the difficulty in this

21

case with respect to that is there are no State

22

standards in terms of evaluating the accuracy or when

23

stuff is removed, when someone wants to be removed from

24

the database.

25

that it was kind of imposed on local public entities

Even the Ninth Circuit recognized that,

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

through the back door, that there are no specific

2

criteria in the statute for removing someone from -­

3

from the list.

4

And that would require the County to start

5

trying to create its own policies or its own procedural

6

schemes.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's what it's

8

charged with doing.

9

responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and

10

It's charged with the

retention of these reports.

11

MR. COATES:

But -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if you're charged

13

with the accuracy, completeness, and retention of the

14

reports, why shouldn't you be responsible for the

15

failure to maintain accurate reports?

16

MR. COATES:

Because it's not so much that

17

they are inaccurate; it's the standards used to remove

18

someone from the list or not.

19

information showing culpability, information showing not

20

culpability, but we don't have a standard to tell us

21

when to remove them from the database and when to leave

22

them in, because that's defined by the State.

Because we may have

23

More importantly, we don't have any

24

procedures on how to go about that, because the

25

statutory scheme doesn't have any for doing that.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the Respondents here

2

argue, don't they, that you should have created a

procedure on your own, right?

4

MR. COATES:

Correct.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, if the -- presumably,

6

that could be brought to the -- that could be brought

before someone who is a County policymaker, couldn't it,

And then that would fall

within Monell.

puzzled about what this case is about.

17

That could be

Correct.
So that's why I'm somewhat

When are we going to get into a situation in

18

which the plaintiffs are asking for prospective relief

19

and the matter cannot be brought before a municipal or

20

County policymaker?

21

MR. COATES:

No, I agree with Your Honor.

22

mean, I think that most of these cases do fit neatly

23

within the Monell framework if a plaintiff pursues them

24

within that framework.

25

The Ninth Circuit doesn't require that,
10

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

though, and kind of just simply lumps the County

2

together with the State and says the State statute's

3

unconstitutional.

4

Declaratory relief against both of you.

5

You're charged with enforcing it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You concede, I take

6

it, or acknowledge that one episode can be the basis -­

7

I mean, going forward -- for a determination that the

8

defendant has a policy, custom, or practice.

9

MR. COATES:

You can.

If you have a

10

policymaker who understands the situation, makes a

11

deliberate decision, yes, I think can you come forward

12

with a Monell claim.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's your

14

adversary's argument, which is by this lawsuit, you have

15

been told that there's something wrong -- it seems

16

pretty natural -- that a report would be kept on the

17

registry that has been declared just plain wrong.

18

The court has said there's no foundation

19

whatsoever for the accuracy of what's in that report,

20

and you have failed to establish a procedure to remove

21

the name.

22

Why aren't you liable under Monell?
MR. COATES:

Well, as a factual matter, the

23

one thing the Ninth Circuit said it wasn't doing was

24

figuring out whether this met the policy, custom, or

25

practice requirement of Monell, because under its case
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

law it doesn't have to do so.

2

order, it said -- declined to do so and, in fact, it has

3

remanded on the damage portion of the case,

4

acknowledging that Monell claims remain open.

5

And, in fact, in the fee

We also contend that for purposes of

6

potential Monell liability that we may not be free under

7

State law to add additional procedural protections.

8

That area may be pre-empted by the State through implied

9

pre-emption under California law.

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, if that's the case, why

wouldn't one of the following be possible?

12

If you -- you say we have no discretion

here.

State procedures; we can't add any new procedure.

So -- and you're

Then, haven't -- in that situation, won't
you have adopted a policy?
MR. COATES:

The way the lower courts have,

21

in the context of liability, viewed this requirement

22

where State law requires a local entity to do something

23

is they have virtually said that they're standing in the

24

shoes of the State.

25

essentially the State making the decision.

Under those circumstances, it's

12

They are

instrument.

6

As it now stands, the statutory scheme

7

doesn't have that, and the County's view is that it's

8

not free to just go out and invent procedures, and other

9

counties throughout the State of California aren't free

10

to invent their own procedures.

11

elements of this case that I think really underscores

12

the Monell concerns with federalism, because it's an

13

important question of the manner in which States relate

14

to their municipalities and the way States divide up

15

responsibility for who does what, and in a fairly

16

important area of the law.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that's one of the

So, even though California

Would you be subject to -- what could

2

MR. COATES:

Well, there would be a possible

pre-emption argument.

They could halt California -­

they could halt Los Angeles from enacting the statute,

from utilizing the procedural protections.

But they could

This -- this is getting

18

further removed from the situation that we're dealing

19

with, because the State has already admitted liability

20

and not has contested that its fees -- it owes fees.

21

So, what is the relief that is left?

If the

22

-- if the State has admitted liability, what happens at

23

that point?

24
25

Shouldn't the record be expunged?
MR. COATES:

I believe the appropriate

argument for the plaintiffs would be to apply in a
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

district court if they believe they have a valid

2

injunction and valid declaratory relief vis-à-vis the

3

State and move forward from there.

4

They could certainly do that and have

5

themselves removed from the database or order the State

6

to create statutory procedures to allow them a hearing

7

to determine whether they should be removed from the

8

database.

9

it's the State statute and it's the State database, and

10

They're perfectly free to do that, because

the State is a party here.

But the State has already

They absolutely

18

appropriate remedy is to file a motion for an injunction

1

2

policy, custom, or practice that's inflicting the injury

3

that's the subject of declaratory relief here.

4

And, I mean, I think at bottom, at the end

5

of the day, the point is that Plaintiffs really haven't

6

identified any circumstance in which, in a proper case

7

applying the Monell standards, you would not be able to

8

get relief.

9

Ninth Circuit's kind of amorphous standard where you

And the danger of going forward with the

10

just impose declaratory relief, independent of whether

11

or not there's a policy, custom, or practice, is the

12

kind of sloppy order that we have here, granting

13

declaratory relief where we have a 90-10 fee split, and

14

it's unclear how that decision was made, because it's

15

not made through the prism of any sort of causation

16

standard articulated by this Court.

17

So we would submit that Monell provides

18

clear guidelines, although sometimes difficult to apply

19

in certain cases, but they are clear guidelines.

20

the Court in Monell said that those causation

21

requirements applied to damages, injunctive and

22

declaratory relief.

23

that supports the interests of federalism and -­

24
25

And

And we believe that is a solid rule

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's true that all cases

that at least have come to us under Monell have involved

MR. COATES:

That is correct.

They have

been damages cases.

4

doesn't talk in terms of guarding the public fisc, which

5

is how Chaloux, the Ninth Circuit case that departs from

6

Monell with injunctive and declaratory relief -- the way

7

it characterizes it.

8
9

But the -- but Monell itself

It doesn't.

Monell was concerned with interpreting the
language of section 1983, the "shall subject," the

10

"shall cause" someone else to subject a person to a

11

violation.

12

respondeat superior principles.

13

legislative history, the 42nd Congress in enacting

14

section 1983 was critical to Justice Brennan in Monell

15

that the rejection of the Sherman Amendment, which he

16

said was concerned mostly with not imposing coercive

17

liability on the municipality for the actions of others.

18

They were concerned not to save money necessarily, but

19

the way in which a Federal court would exercise coercive

20

power over a local public entity.

21

They said that did not really conform to
And looking at the

And we submit that it is just as important

22

to have those guidelines when directly coercing through

injunctive and declaratory relief as it is indirectly

Off the top of my head -­

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

would help you in this case, because you would say,

16

well, if there's a real problem, the city -- the injured

party can sue for an injunction.

18

against the party first, and he can -- he can raise a

19

constitutional defense or he can bring an action for an

20

injunction, and it doesn't have to be under 1983.

21

it would seem to me that that would resolve it.

22

then wouldn't have to pay attorneys' fees because

23

there's no provision in the statute for it.

83 is the exclusive means for all relief.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You can

No, I'm talking about

under Federal law.
MR. COATES:

My understanding with respect

7

to a general constitutional claim is that it is section

8

1983, that that is the Congress's -- that's how Congress

9

has specified the remedy.

There are other portions for

10

other types of conduct -- section 1986, section 1985,

11

for example -- but I think this sort of general

12

constitutional claim is subject to section 1983.

And if the Court has no further questions,
I'd reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Let me begin, perhaps, by trying to answer

22

Justice Alito's question about what is at stake here.

23

Monell held that 1983 has a causation requirement.

24

the Court has, in a series of decisions, elucidated what

25

a plaintiff must prove in the context of claims for
20

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

damages to satisfy that causation requirement, and it's

2

held in particular that the mere fact that a city

employee committed a violation under color of State law

in the past is not itself a sufficient link to the

municipality itself.

The question here arises in what, we submit,

10

is the very different factual context of ongoing

11

constitutional violations.

12

the jurisprudence that's developed under Monell has been

13

done a -- has been devoted to fleshing out this other

14

context, the Court should take a look at whether that

15

jurisprudence is the appropriate way to determine

16

whether the causation test is satisfied when there is an

17

ongoing violation, because there's an easier way to do

18

it.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we think that although

It's the same statutory

20

language that you're relying on, right, that was held to

21

require causation in the one case?

22

require a similar causation in the other?

23

MR. PINCUS:

Why wouldn't it

Your Honor, we believe it does

24

require causation, but the question is what kind of

25

facts have to be shown to prove causation.
21

Alderson Reporting Company

And, in

Official

1

particular, once a plaintiff has shown what is required

2

otherwise to show the violation, to show standing for

3

prospective relief and obtain prospective relief, we

4

think those elements will necessarily encompass the

5

showing that's required to prove a link to the

6

municipality itself.

7

And what our concern here -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then you're not really

8

hurt if -- or the system isn't really hurt by the rule

9

that the city asks for.

If it's so easy to establish a

10

policy or custom requirement in cases where prospective

11

relief is sought, then that's the answer.

12

establish it.

13

you establish the custom and practice.

14

End of case.

MR. PINCUS:

You can

But you don't get it unless

Your Honor, we think it should

15

be easy.

16

concern is that courts might be confused by the idea

17

that what they are supposed to do is apply the

18

jurisprudence that's really been developed to target who

19

was responsible for this act that happened in the past,

20

and not realize that there's really a quite more

21

expeditious way to determine in the future.

22

It should be present in every case.

Here, it's quite clear.

Our

The court of

I interpret your remarks as saying that

8

easy to do, it doesn't make any difference.

9

why are we here?

10

Do I

Well, then,

Why isn't the city right?

MR. PINCUS:

Because I think what the city

11

has said, Your Honor, is what Monell requires is for the

12

plaintiff to show something in addition to what the

13

plaintiff has to -- to what the plaintiff has to show to

14

(a) prove a constitutional violation, and (b) prove an

15

entitlement to prospective relief.

16

The plaintiff says there is an additional

17

element that may or not be present, and our submission

18

is that the Ninth Circuit, although its rationale may

19

have been slightly off, was correct in saying once a

20

plaintiff has shown an ongoing constitutional violation

21

and that the plaintiff is entitled, under standing

22

principles and principles governing prospective relief,

23

to relief, the plaintiff has necessarily shown a link to

24

the municipality.

And there is -­

So you agree -- it struck me that your argument

Monell couldn't be satisfied?

Well, Monell doesn't

No.

No.
I was trying to do just

an analogy in terms of -- because one of his arguments

10

has been that -- that Ex parte Young doesn't have,

11

inherently, a Monell requirement.

12
13

MR. PINCUS:

Well, if I may, Your Honor,

just to respond to the Chief Justice's statement -­

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you.

The Petitioner's position is

16

that this standard would apply also in Ex parte Young

17

actions against State officials.

18
19
20

The Court's -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That, of course,

isn't before us.
MR. PINCUS:

It's not before you.

The

21

Court's jurisprudence is a little -- is a little

22

uncertain as to whether that might or might not be true.

23

There certainly hasn't been a holding to that effect.

24
25

But one of the reasons we think this is an
important issue to be very clear about is because, at
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

least on Petitioner's view and possibly on the view of

2

how -- depending on how the Court analyzes the case,

3

this would affect not just the universe of cases against

4

municipalities, but also whether relief is available for

5

ongoing constitutional violations in the very broad

6

group of cases against -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that would

8

require -- that would require us to get into the

9

question of whether Ex parte Young is a fiction or

10

substance, which I certainly wouldn't like to get into.

11

MR. PINCUS:

Well, but it -- it might not,

12

Your Honor, because it might turn just on whether -- I

13

mean, Ex parte Young suits against State officials are

14

under 1983.

15

Petitioner would make is if causation is required under

16

1983, well, Ex parte Young is just a vehicle to get

17

those people -- to make those people persons.

18

whatever the Court were to decide about causation would

19

necessarily apply in those Ex parte Young actions.

20

And so to some -- I think the argument that

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so

Well, I have a question

21

similar to Justice Sotomayor's.

22

that the Monell requirement applies to prospective

23

relief, injunctive and declaratory relief.

24
25

Suppose we were to hold

Can you provide an example of a -- an
unacceptable consequence that would follow from -- from

that holding, a situation in which that holding would -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well -­
What difference does it

make?

7

MR. PINCUS:

I think, Your Honor, we gave

8

some examples in our -- in our brief.

And one I would

9

give is the example of the marriage license clerk who is

10

engaging in unconstitutional -- who is -- who is

11

violating the Constitution and denying marriage

12

licenses.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right -­

14

MR. PINCUS:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

policymaker, and the municipal policymaker will say:

He or she is not -­
Now we have a situation.
And then I

And then Monell is satisfied, right?

22

MR. PINCUS:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I -­
If the policymaker says, it

24

is our policy to deny licenses under this -- under these

25

circumstances, that's a policy.
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. PINCUS:

It may be that -- I don't think

2

the Court has required that there be some exhaustion of

3

administrative remedies.

4

at the case is, if -- if the party who is being injured

5

filed suit against the municipality and against the

6

official and said, I would like a marriage license, that

7

-- and the court heard the case and found yes, there's

8

an unconstitutional denial going on there, the fact that

9

the lawsuit existed and there was an ongoing violation

I guess the way I would look

10

that had been, by virtue of the lawsuit, brought to the

11

attention of the policymaker, and if in that case the

12

judge decided that prospective relief is necessary,

13

which necessarily means that there was some finding of

14

ongoing violation under Lyons and those cases, that

15

there would be a link to the municipality.

16

And I -- my concern is not that, properly

17

applied, a causation requirement would weed out cases.

18

It's that because the focus of the Court's jurisprudence

19

up till now has not been on the ongoing violation as the

20

possible source of a policy, but rather was there a

21

policymaker involved in the initial denial, unless if

22

the Court were to say there's an extra step, it were to

23

make very clear that the focus of attention is not the

24

initial action, in terms of finding a policy, but on the

25

day -- as the matter ends up on the day the district
28

those facts are relevant in deciding whether there is a

in your hypothetical -- I may have misunderstood it -­

that this was a sort of a one-off decision by the -- by

possibilities -- three possibilities.

Now, those are the only three I can think

12

of.

13

against the city, and in (C) you couldn't.

MR. PINCUS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

If there's no city policy,

then the city hasn't done anything wrong under Monell.
Now, is that what you're arguing?

That the

23

city should, even though it has no policy, nonetheless

24

have to have attorneys' fees, is open to suit, et

25

cetera, and forget about Monell?

Is that your argument?

30

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. PINCUS:

My argument is this, Your

2

Honor, that if -- if there is one clerk who issues

3

marriage licenses and that clerk continues to deny the

4

marriage license up until the day of the lawsuit, that

5

the plaintiff in that case is entitled to relief, to

6

injunctive relief, because the city, by virtue of

7

tolerating the conduct, has adopted a de facto policy of

8

permitting it.

And the alternative is -­

If you're right

about that, there's no problem for you because you are

question on which I think guidance to the lower courts

would be very helpful is not to simply say Monell is -­

17

Monell applies, adopt our jurisprudence that was focused

on retrospective conduct or prospective conduct; but

19

rather, yes, Monell's causation requirement applies, but

20

we recognize that in this context it's likely to be

21

satisfied by the other things that the plaintiff is

22

required to prove.

that open.

2

Monell doesn't apply to forward relief -- declaratory

3

relief or injunctive relief.

4

has rejected the statement in Monell itself that it

5

applies to all forms of relief.

6

But Monell -- we're not deciding because

And so the Ninth Circuit

And so that's the question we are confronted

7

with.

8

only with damage actions, was -- was the Monell decision

9

wrong in saying that that framework applies to

10

Because we have had experience in Monell cases

declaratory and injunctive relief as well?

11

MR. PINCUS:

And, Your Honor, my response to

12

that is that Monell was not wrong.

13

Monell squarely addressed the question, but clearly the

14

statute has a causation element and it has to be met.

15

I don't know that

But what Monell didn't grapple with, because

16

it itself was a case involving only a past

17

non-continuing event, is how does that causation

18

requirement get met in a case involving an ongoing

19

violation?

20

And we think that although the Ninth Circuit

21

may not have had its reasoning quite right, what -­

22

the -- the bottom line was right, in the conclusion that

23

when there is an ongoing violation and the other

24

requirements for relief are met, Monell/the 1983

25

causation requirement doesn't impose an incremental

burden on the plaintiff.

the other things that the plaintiff has to prove.

It's necessarily satisfied by

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sort of asking for a hypothetical and to take it

5

from the abstract.

ongoing violation as the failure to institute

procedures, I'm assuming, to remove a name from the

registry, correct?

Or was it that you

thought that the city could remove the name?
I'm not quite sure what it is that you
think -- what was the continuing violation?
MR. PINCUS:

The continuing violation here

20

is that every day for the past 9 years, our Respondents

21

22

because they have not been given any sufficient process

23

to show that they are wrongfully included in the index.

injunction.

by inaction.

here, because the court of appeals -­

arguing whether Monell was satisfied or not, and you're

going to get a chance to do that on remand because the

anything.

MR. PINCUS:

by -- by issuing a declaratory judgment and by finding

with -- with simply saying, as my friend does, that

10

Monell applies.

11

whether the damages started accruing on the very first

12

day the process wasn't -- wasn't provided, there might

13

be a question about whether on that day there was a

14

municipal policy in 2002 when this controversy started.

15

For the damages question, for example,

It might be that on that day there was no

16

municipal policy one way or another.

17

confronted it.

18

Maybe no one had

Maybe nobody confronted it until 2006.

But I think one thing -- so for damages

19

there's a somewhat different inquiry which is, for each

20

day for which damages are claimed, was that -- is the

21

policy requirement met?

22

which is on a going-forward basis to provide -- to -- to

23

be entitled to the prospective relief, what kind of

causation is made.

From the time that

From the time the suit is

filed both -- the injunctive test will also be the
damages test.

11

MR. PINCUS:

But the difference, I think,

12

Your Honor, is to recover damages, the plaintiff doesn't

13

have to show that the other elements of the damages

14

claim don't encompass the kind of requirement of

15

municipal -- of municipal involvement that is

16

encompassed within the other elements of the prospective

17

relief claim.

18

is that there is no need -- the plaintiff does not have

19

to show something more to show causation than he has to

20

show to show the violation and to show the entitlement

21

to ongoing relief.

22

So when a case has both, our submission

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let me follow this.

To

23

bring a damages claim, do you have to show past damages,

24

or can you just collect damages from the date you file

25

MR. PINCUS:

I think it -- I mean, you would

you just want to collect damages from the day you filed

the suit.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, in -- if that's the

6

complaint that you file, then -- then in that kind of a

7

suit the test for damages and the test for injunction

8

would be precisely the same, and you would be able to

9

get damages on the basis of the mere fact that the suit

exists, right?

for some indefinite period of time.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that doesn't -­
Well, he doesn't get

Once -- I suppose once the legal process has concluded,

MR. PINCUS:

consequence of that structure is that the city can leave

the reasons they sent it back was to -- for -- so that

notion that -- it's hard to come up with a situation

14

where there will be an entitlement to prospective relief

and the requisite causation won't be satisfied.

therefore, saying there is this additional element, it

sort of creates more harm than good because it's going

to serve -- send courts on a search for it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You would have liked the

MR. PINCUS:

That's the only thing that the

County petitioned from, Your Honor, but I think more is

at stake here because if this rule applied, then it

13

would not only preclude attorneys' fees; it would also

14

preclude the awarding of any relief.

15

this -- it happens to arise here in the attorneys' fees

just an extra box to check in terms of something

the Monell standards, someone couldn't get prospective

relief where it was appropriate, where the injury was

actually inflicted by the municipality.

The

lower courts in talking about this issue in the context

8

of Monell claims against local public entities have

said, look, if you are just enforcing State law, if you

10

have no discretion, you're not really making a conscious

11

decision, you have to do this under State law, you're

essentially acting as an arm of the State Eleventh

Amendment Ex parte Young.

case, which is an employment case where they sued a

15

local entity for employment decisions that were dictated

16

by a State board.
