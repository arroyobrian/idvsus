ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. SIMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Second Circuit's decision vacating for

11

lack of jurisdiction a settlement agreement that

12

compensated authors for all their arguably infringed

13

works in the face of Congress's direction that Federal

14

district courts shall have jurisdiction over any civil

15

action arising under copyright is wrong for three

16

reasons.

17

incorrect under the unanimous holding three years ago in

18

Arbaugh that where Congress affords unqualified subject

19

matter jurisdiction, other statutory provisions argued

20

to be jurisdictional that do not clearly restrict that

21

jurisdiction won't be deemed to do so.

22

First, even -- first, the decision is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is a lot harder

23

case than Arbaugh, though.

Arbaugh involved the

24

definition of an employer and then the scope of the

25

statute.

This one says no suit shall be instituted.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SIMS:

Well, Arbaugh relied heavily on

2

the Zipes case, and the Zipes involved a statutory

3

threshold condition much like the one here.

4

couldn't bring a Title VII action unless you filed a

5

particular kind of piece of paper with the EEOC.

6

Zipes and Arbaugh both held that those statutory

7

conditions or essential ingredients were not

8

jurisdictional, and the Court relied, heavily I think,

9

on the fact that jurisdiction was separately provided

10
11

You

And

for and the provisions at issue weren't.
The second point I want to make is that,

12

even putting the clear statement rule of Arbaugh to one

13

side, statutory text, structure, purpose and history all

14

point to classifying 411(a) as mandatory but not

15

jurisdictional.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think you are

17

right that Arbaugh at least set forth a clear statement

18

rule, but I think that's significant only going forward.

19

I don't know that Congress, when it passed this

20

provision, could have been aware of the clear statement

21

rule that Arbaugh articulated.

22

MR. SIMS:

Well, the Court did apply -

23

reiterate and apply the Arbaugh rule in the Rockwell

24

case with respect to a provision that had predated

25

Arbaugh, and nothing in Arbaugh said that.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But in any event, our second point is that

2

if you look at the traditional indicia of not only text

3

but also structure, history and purpose, this provision

4

should be ranked as mandatory but not jurisdictional.

5

And the third point I want to get to -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you agree with the -

7

with the government that it's mandatory for the district

8

court but prohibited to the court of appeals?

9

government has this hybrid where, because of the public

The

10

purposes served by registration, not only can but the

11

district court should raise the failure to register on

12

its own, but then the government says once you have a

13

final judgment in district court, it's no longer open

14

for the court of appeals to raise it on its own.

15

Do you agree with that or do you say it's

16

for the defendants to raise, and if they don't raise it,

17

too bad?

18

MR. SIMS:

Justice Ginsburg, we certainly

19

agree with the government with respect to the court of

20

appeals.

21

hand, my clients don't -- are satisfied with the

22

government's position.

23

Scalia's decision, I think, in Day v. McDonough pointed

24

out, the traditional default rule really is that

25

defenses are up to defendants to raise.

With respect to the district court, on the one

On the other hand, as Justice

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

In this particular kind of situation where

2

there is no reason at all, I think, to suspect that

3

defense counsel will not raise 411 whenever -- none of

4

the cases that Ms. Merritt raises for example, involve

5

situations of waiver, where the issues weren't raised

6

until the court of appeals -- I think that the Court can

7

rely, frankly, on defendants and on the ability of

8

district judges to nudge defense counsel when they need

9

nudging.

10

But if the Court felt that the provision was

11

important enough so that it wanted to impose on district

12

courts the obligation of strict policing, I think it

13

could.

14

law for 25 years; I've never seen a defendant who either

15

missed a defense or chose not to raise it.

But as I say, I have been practicing copyright

16

The third point I want to raise if there is

17

time is simply that, even if 411(a) were deemed

18

jurisdictional at the outset of the case with respect to

19

its language which talks about instituting, nothing in

20

either its text or purpose suggests that Congress meant

21

to deprive district courts of their usual power to

22

settle cases with respect to approving settlement

23

agreements.

24
25

In this case, because the plaintiffs
complied with 411(a) at the front door by alleging
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

properly that they had complied with the obligation, we

2

think the district court had jurisdiction to send the

3

parties to mediation and then necessarily to approve the

4

agreement they returned with three years later.

5

with respect to -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now

Can -- can I ask you, one

7

of the points made by the amicus is that, if I recall it

8

correctly, that what -- what Congress had in mind in

9

phrasing it this way was to enable -- enable the party

10

who had not gone to the Copyright Office to go after

11

dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and the implication

12

is that if it were not held to be jurisdictional, there

13

would be a merits dismissal because of the failure to

14

have gone to the Copyright Office first.

15

would not -- the plaintiff would not be able to come

16

back to the court.

17

MR. SIMS:

And therefore

I don't understand the amicus to

18

be making that argument.

19

to -

If Your Honor is referring

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. SIMS:

I don't -

-- the third -- the third

22

sentence of 411(a), I think that's the principal

23

argument she makes as to why this satisfies Arbaugh and

24

we think, quite to the contrary, the third sentence of

25

411(a) 7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

think it related to the third sentence.

3

she said the whole purpose of Congress was to make sure

4

that you'd be able to come back, that your failure to go

5

to the Copyright Office initially would not result in a

6

merits dismissal so that you could not later go back and

7

then rebring the suit.

8

jurisdictional dismissal, the jurisdiction could be

9

cured by going to the Copyright Office and your suit

10

No, I didn't -- I didn't
I -- I thought

If it was jurisdictional, just a

could then proceed.

11

MR. SIMS:

Your Honor, I think that the -

12

because of the way 411(a) is phrased, dismissals under

13

411(a), whether we are correct that it's not

14

jurisdictional or whether they are correct that it is, I

15

think ordinarily -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. SIMS:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

-- without prejudice -

MR. SIMS:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. SIMS:

Absolutely.
That's what I thought.

That's the nature of this

requirement.

24
25

You'd be able to come back

anyway?

You would be -

MR. SIMS:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

Yeah.
Yeah.

With respect to the Arbaugh Would -- if the statute of

limitations had run, could you still come back?

6

MR. SIMS:

The problem in this case, and

7

really the reason why the settlement agreement has

8

turned out the way it did is there is no effective -

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, not -- not

10

necessarily in this case, but in -- but in a typical

11

case.

12

MR. SIMS:

There is no effective statute of

13

limitations in these cases, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. SIMS:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. SIMS:

I said in a typical case.

Well Or is it just -

In -- in a case where the

18

infringement is the existence of something on the web,

19

then there is no statute of limitations effectively,

20

because the argument would be that the making available

21

is an infringement.

22

We don't think that the last sentence of

23

411(a) satisfies Arbaugh or indeed is -- is any evidence

24

toward this being jurisdictional.

25

inserted, as the history makes perfectly clear, to solve

The last sentence was

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the problem created by the Vacheron decision that the

2

Second Circuit had decided in 1958.

3

what justice -- Judge Hand had done, and other courts

4

have done it, too, is to say it is -- district courts

5

cannot review the registrar's action in denying

6

registration, and that has to be done in a separate

7

mandamus action, at that point in Washington, D.C.

8
9

And in that case,

So the lesson simply is Congress's way of
saying very clearly:

We want to get rid of that

10

rigamarole and we want to allow all this to be done

11

efficiently.

12

even if the registrant didn't show up is not at all any

13

statement, much less a clear statement, that this was

14

intended to be jurisdictional.

15

But the statement that this could be done

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now Mr. Sims, it has been

16

pointed out that you have taken inconsistent positions.

17

That is, back in the district court before there was a

18

settlement, you urged before the district court that

19

411(a) was a jurisdictional bar and that that precluded

20

certifying a class that included the non-registered

21

copyright holders.

22

district court, and now you are saying -- you are

23

confessing error, that was wrong?

24

MR. SIMS:

25

You did make that argument in the

Your Honor, I don't think it's

fair to say that we made that argument.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

We did -- we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

did issue, we did say that sentence in one or two

2

places, and the argument -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MR. SIMS:

The argument -

But I think it's -- I think it's

5

different, because the issue in the district court was

6

the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the

7

settlement and there was an attack on the different

8

valuation for unregistered claims.

9

relied on 411(a).

In that context we

The argument would have been exactly

10

the same had we said, as we should have, that 411(a) is

11

mandatory but not jurisdictional.

12

exactly the loose language that this Court was guilty of

13

in Robinson and Smith, as it pointed out in Eberhart or

14

Kontrick.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. SIMS:

We were guilty of

And -- and -

But as -- but as the Court

17

decision in that case said, there was no need to

18

overrule Robinson or Smith because really what was going

19

on there was the Court had been saying the rule was

20

mandatory, and the additional language that was

21

jurisdictional was loose language.

22

Our argument never focused on the ranking of

23

411(a).

It was always rooted in the existence of the

24

rule which did justify, and on the merits of the appeal

25

back in the Second Circuit we will again argue did
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

justify, a different valuation of the claim.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you shouldn't use

3

loose language, especially when it's the same loose

4

language, supposedly, that seems to have been used by

5

all the courts of appeals and all the district courts.

6

MR. SIMS:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. SIMS:

9

Not all the courts For years and years.

Your Honor, the first court of

appeals which said that 411(a) said -- not held -- was

10

jurisdictional was in 1990.

That's well after the 1976

11

act, and the original act had been -- I mean, the 1909

12

act, which it was patterned after, had been nearly

13

100 years earlier.

14

ever said that the 1909 act was jurisdictional, and when

15

this Court had that case in the Washingtonian case in

16

the 1930s, there was no reference to it being

17

jurisdictional by either the majority or the dissent.

18

And I think Washingtonian is particularly interesting

19

because there the district court had originally held

20

that it was jurisdictional and then sua sponte recanted

21

a few days later and issued another position.

22

is in the record of this Court in Washingtonian and it

23

was pointed out by Professor Ben Kaplan in the report to

24

the register and to Congress in connection with the 1976

25

act.

There was no court of appeals that

12
Alderson Reporting Company

And that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So the issue was raised for people to think

2

about if anybody had.

3

at any time earlier say that this was intended to be

4

jurisdictional or was jurisdictional.

5

passing the Arbaugh argument with respect to text,

6

structure, history and purpose -- the structure I think

7

is particularly telling, because in this case the

8

provision of jurisdiction is in Title 28, the provision

9

of registration is in the Copyright Act.

10

But Congress did not in 1976 or

So if -- if

They've been

separated -

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But still it's a statute

12

and didn't this Court say in Bowles that a statutory

13

qualification on the right to sue is generally

14

jurisdictional?

15

MR. SIMS:

I don't think the Court said

16

that.

17

respect to time limits for appeal.

18

quite clearly limited to time limits for appeal, and the

19

Court's decision rested on -- heavily on stare decisis.

20

With respect to -

21

I think that the Court said that in Bowles with

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think Bowles is

But I thought they made a

22

distinction to distinguish the other cases, the one -- I

23

forgot -- the one involving Criminal Rule 33, on the

24

ground, well, that's a court rule, but when Congress

25

makes the qualification then it's jurisdictional.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SIMS:

But this doesn't involve a time

2

limit.

3

ingredients of the claim, preconditions to the claim,

4

threshold steps with respect to the claim, and I think

5

there is no reason for the Arbaugh approach not to

6

apply.

7

the language is telling as well.

8
9

This involves, as Arbaugh and Zipes did,

But in any event the structure is telling here;

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if you are

talking about the language, what about John R. Sand &

10

Gravel?

11

the statute said:

12

language here is "No suit shall be instituted."

13

sounds pretty close.

14

That said we held it was jurisdictional when
"Suits shall be barred."

MR. SIMS:

The

15

Roberts.

16

statutes in 1831, as our reply brief points out, and

17

includes the language for statutes of limitation and for

18

copyright notice.

And all of those have always been

19

deemed mandatory.

None of them has been deemed

20

jurisdictional.

21

The language here has been used in copyright

Again, Section 507 of the Copyright Act, the

22

statute of limitations provision here, has almost

23

exactly the same language as in 411.

24

think the Court treated as in Bowles -

25

MR. SIMS:

It shall

4

special situation of suits against the government and

5

considerations of sovereign immunity.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

it was mandatory.

8

word "jurisdictional."

9

I thought the Court said

I don't remember when they used the

MR. SIMS:

Well, I think John R. Sand held

10

that provision was jurisdictional, but I think the

11

decision went off on -- on stare decisis, and the fact

12

that the Court had, with respect to the Tucker Act and

13

matters of suits against the government, taken a

14

different position.

15

Those, I think, are really the only

16

carve-outs, the statutory time limits for appeal and

17

suits against the government, from the general Arbaugh

18

rule.

19

So here Congress has used this language

20

repeatedly.

This Court's own forms for copyright

21

infringement, which were first promulgated in the 1930s,

22

have patterned our argument and are contrary to the

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. SIMS:

12

We have gone through the history.

13

really only one change and in every respect it is

14

identical to what it was in 1938.

15

it separates out the registration provision from the

16

jurisdictional provision.

Yes.

It'S Form 19.
It was originally Form 17.
But I think there is

And, again, as I say,

17

If Congress had wanted to make registration

18

jurisdictional, it would have been extraordinarily easy

19

to do so.

20

beginning of 411(a) is "notwithstanding anything in 1338

21

and 1331."

All they would have had to add at the

22

We have -- we have included in our brief as

23

an appendix about 60-odd Federal statutes, which carved

24

out jurisdiction otherwise provided by 1331 or other

MS. ANDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Statutory prerequisites to suit like Section

17

411(a) often fall into one of two distinct categories.

18

They are either jurisdictional and therefore unwaivable

19

or they are not jurisdictional and are fully waivable.

20

Section 411(a)'s registration requirement falls in the

21

middle of those two extremes.

22

It is not jurisdictional, but it should not

23

be fully waivable.

The provision does not speak to the

24

power of the courts to decide cases and therefore it

25

does not limit the court's jurisdiction to adjudicate
19

infringement suits.

2

But, because of this phrase and mandatory

3

language, the requirement should be strictly enforced

4

whenever the defendant asserts it, and because the

5

requirement serves important public interest that are

6

independent of the concerns of the parties to any

7

individual suit -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So your position is that

the district court really should have dismissed this
case at the outset?
MS. ANDERS:

I think that, in the ordinary

12

case, the district court should -- when -- when the

13

defendant waives the requirement, which would be the

14

rare case, when the defendant doesn't assert it.

15

the defendant waives the requirement, the district court

16

should consider whether accepting that waiver would

17

undermine the public interest behind 411.

18

When

Now, in this particular case, it may not

19

have been an abuse of discretion for the district court

20

to consider those interests and decide that here it

21

would have been acceptable to accept the defendant's

22

waiver and permit the resolution to go forward because,

23

in this case, the periodicals that -- that are

24

involved -- the works at issue were primarily already in

25

the possession of the Library of Congress, because they
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

had been registered as -- the periodicals themselves had

2

been registered.

3

So the Library's interest is not as strongly

4

implicated here.

5

there was going to be settlement, so the Court wasn't

6

going to need to adjudicate the copyright claims and

7

therefore the opportunity for the register's views to be

8

taken into account was less important.

9

In addition, this is a case in which

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

11

Library of Congress?

12
13

Maybe this is the same

Are you representing the interest of the

MS. ANDERS:

Yes, we are representing the

interest of the Library of Congress.

14

So I think in this case it may have been

15

appropriate for the district court to conclude that -

16

that it could let someone go forward, notwithstanding

17

the fact that some unregistered copyrights were

18

involved.

19

But after adjudication on the merits, the

20

defendant has waived the requirement, and, having come

21

up, Section 411(a), like any other non-jurisdictional

22

rule, should be subject to the general principle that

23

issues that are not raised below should not be

24

considered for the first time on appeal, absent

25

extraordinary circumstances.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You were candid to say

2

that this is in a hybrid category, that the government

3

was taking an intermediate position.

4

other provision where the district court has an

5

obligation to raise the question on its own motion that

6

is yet not jurisdictional?

7

MS. ANDERS:

Do you know of any

I believe this Court has

8

recognized that waiver doctrines in general are

9

discretionary, and so, particularly in the area of res

10

judicata, the Court has recognized in the Plaut v.

11

Spendthrift Farm and Arizona v. California that the

12

Court has some discretion to enforce res judicata on its

13

own motion.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Very, very limited.

I

15

think Arizona didn't say any time there's -- there's a

16

preclusion plea, the Court can raise it on its own.

17

MS. ANDERS:

That's correct.

I think also

18

the plain error rule presupposes that there are some

19

errors that the district court has a responsibility to

20

correct on its own, even though neither party has

21

brought the error to its attention.

22

the district court has the obligation to issue a legal

23

ruling that neither party has asked for, and I think

24

that kind of regime is appropriate here because the

25

public interest at issue, the Library's interest and the
22
Alderson Reporting Company

So in other words,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interest in the public record of copyright, those don't

2

depend on the defendant's litigation decisions -- they

3

shouldn't depend on the defendant's particular strategic

decisions within a particular case.

5

The Library's interest will always be in

6

having every work registered and the public interest and

public record will be the same.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is your discussion

of that, including in your response to Justice Ginsburg

10

and in your brief, do you think that that's within the

11

question presented, rephrased?

12

MS. ANDERS:

I think it is fairly within the

13

question of whether the rule is jurisdictional or not, I

14

think, is -- also encompasses the question of how the

15

rule should be enforced, assuming that it is

16

non-jurisdictional, of what should happen in this case.

17

So I do think that the -- the

18

characterization of this rule as a mandatory or a

19

waivable rule is -- is within the question presented.

20

So I think that the regime we're proposing best gives

21

effect to the mandatory, but non-jurisdictional language

22

that Congress used in Section 411(a).

23

And it also protects the public interest

24

that the requirement serves, which, again, the

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But how -- how would we get

4

to hold what -- what you say is the law?

5

me, once we decide it's not jurisdictional and once we

6

agree with you, that it doesn't -- at least in this

7

case -- didn't have to be raised sua sponte by the

8

district court.

9

It seems, to

That's the end of the case, and so why do we

10

have to engage in the further discussion, well,

11

ordinarily, the district court must raise it on its

12

own and -- you know, and, if it doesn't ordinarily -

13

you know, the appellate court should.

14

Why do we have to get into that?

15

MS. ANDERS:

into it, Justice Scalia.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MS. ANDERS:

Which means we shouldn't.

Well, that may be the case, but

20

I think we are simply trying to -- trying to explain to

21

the Court what we think how the rule should be applied

22

in the district court, in the -- in the ordinary case,

23

and then, in the rare case, this one, where the

24

defendant has waived, and permitting the settlement to

25

go forward, it wouldn't adversely affect the public
24
Alderson Reporting Company

interest that are normally in force here.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have an

3

example of the non-ordinary case?

4

say, either -- I guess it's not always after judgment

5

that it shouldn't be implemented, I guess.

6

wouldn't it be after judgment?

7

MS. ANDERS:

I mean, you seem to

But when

I think that the -- that in

8

general, the requirement would be considered waived if

9

it's not raised before judgment.

We can't think of a

10

case in which the extraordinary circumstance would be

11

fulfilled.

12
13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's more -- so

it's more or less jurisdictional after judgment?
MS. ANDERS:

No, I'm sorry.

What I meant to

15

say was that I don't think this rule could ever be

16

enforced, in the first instance, on appeal if it has

17

been waived below.

18

non-jurisdictional requirements is that if it's not

19

raised before judgment, it's lost on appeal -

I think the general civil rule for

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's normal, but

not invariable.
MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think that's the

24

rule -- that's the rule that this Court has applied to

25

constitutional rights with the plain error rule, and
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

also, with respect to structural constitutional rights

2

that might implicate other public interests, the general

rule is that if the requirement has not been raised

during the -- during the trial stages of the case, then

5

it can't be enforced for the first time on appeal.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MS. ANDERS:

Unless it is plain error.

circumstances would be true in most cases in which the

21

at the trial stage.

22

extraordinary circumstance is present here that would

23

justify overturning the independent interest in judgment

24

that our legal system has, the finality of judgment, the

rights of the parties in relying on that judgment and

2

You know, I think in some ways we can think

3

of this requirement as sort of like a filing fee, that

4

it's -- it serves interests beyond those of the parties

5

at the district court, and therefore you wouldn't think

6

of it as waivable at the instance of the defendant.

--

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

There really are, in

our recent decisions, it seems to me, two different

10

lines of authority.

11

Sand and Gravel, which treats these sorts of things as

12

jurisdictional, and the Arbaugh line that doesn't.

13

it does seem to me that the language here, "No suit

14

shall be instituted," sounds an awful lot like "suit

15

shall be barred," or the other language in -- in Bowles.

16

There is the Bowles and the John R.

MS. ANDERS:

And

I think it's similar to a lot

17

of language that's used in statutes of limitations,

18

which are traditionally considered non-jurisdictional,

19

that no statute -- no suit shall be instituted.

20

I think what's important is that it speaks

21

in terms of the actions of the parties, because the

22

parties institute a suit, not the Court.

So it doesn't

23

speak in terms of the power of the Court.

And there's

24

no evidence, I don't think, that Congress intended to

25

withdraw the broad grant to jurisdiction in 1331 and
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1338.

2

which the Court's own precedents had previously treated

3

the rules at issue as jurisdictional, had accorded them

4

jurisdictional consequences.

5

which the Court relied on stare decisis, but I don't

6

think that we have any similar situation here.

7

no -

8
9

I think Bowles and John R. Sand are cases in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So those are cases in

There's

What about the

congressional reaction to the Second Circuit's decision?

10

It provided that the -- there was to be no

11

jurisdictional bar in criminal matters.

12

didn't affect jurisdiction in criminal matters, but it

13

didn't say anything about civil matters.

14

some kind of reflected acceptance that in some of the

15

civil -- in civil cases, it would be jurisdictional?

16

MS. ANDERS:

Didn't -- it

I don't think so.

So isn't that

I think, in

17

enacting that, Congress had recognized that the

18

incentives for registration should stay in place in the

19

civil context, but that making an exception wouldn't -

20

wouldn't make a difference in the criminal context.

21

I think Congress still spoke of it as a -

22

as a non-jurisdictional requirement in the legislative

23

history, so I don't think that there is any indication

24

that Congress has ratified the Second Circuit's decision

25

here.

quite analogous, although stronger than the statute in

"No action shall be instituted," instead of "No action

14

this statute does not impose a jurisdictional limit,

which I will strongly argue that it does, it at the very

least imposes a mandatory command like the statute in

In -- aren't there

statutes that have exhaustion requirements, or like the

in this case, the story of the Copyright Act and its

language is very distinctive, both in the public

uses.

5

Again, on the statutory language, we have

the very mandatory language, "no action shall be

8

waiver.

9

that this statute is like fee waivers.

No modifiers; there's no provision for

The Solicitor General's assistant mentioned
It's not at all

like a fee waiver, because the statute for fee waivers

11

13

This statute contains no waiver for the parties.

14

contains no discretion for the district judge.

15

It

And in the last word of -- the last sentence

16

of this very short three-sentence provision, Congress

17

referred explicitly to jurisdiction.

reading of this section will show -- shows that Congress

intended the entire provision to refer to the

The reason that courts could not consider a

certificate from the registrant.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

4

that cut against you in the sense that the same

5

paragraph Congress used the word "jurisdiction," but

6

they didn't use that in the provision that you are

7

arguing, does deprive the court of jurisdiction.

8
9

MS. JONES MERRITT:

No, Mr. Chief Justice,

because when Congress revised this statute in 1976, it

10

had before it 60 years already of courts construing its

11

language, no action shall be maintained, which was the

12

previous 1909 language as a jurisdictional limit.

13

had not been any resistance to that notion.

14

There

Even courts as early as the 1920s in the

15

Lumiere case, the Second Circuit did not hold there was

16

"jurisdiction," but it held that this provision was

17

unwaiverable.

18

course, is to waive the provision.

19

What the parties want to do here, of

So the language was working quite nicely for

20

Congress.

No action shall be maintained, they switched

it to instituted to make clear that they meant at the

10

Congress then adds this second

Congress adds the second sentence which adds the

And then in the final sentence, Congress

gives a clarification about that final group of cases.

11

As Justice Ginsburg said, the -- Congress

12

made clear that when the registrar decides not to appear

13

in these cases, the Court may still go on and has the

14

power to decide these cases.

15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not -- it's not

a very big deal to register your copyright, right?

17

MS. JONES MERRITT:

It is not at all a big

18

deal, Your Honor.

In fact, for freelance writers one

19

may register an entire year's worth of work on a single

20

form for $65.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

doesn't that mean that it would be odd to make

23

jurisdiction over an action for infringement hinge on

24

whether you've, you know, dotted an "I" and crossed a

25

"T"?
36
Alderson Reporting Company

If one of those articles is a freelance

track him down and get his permission to use that

7

So the registration system was Congress's

8

response to this problem of finding the owners of

9

copyright.

10

In this JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't it true, though,

11

that -- that most copyright holders, most people who

12

write articles, freelance articles, even if it's only

13

$65, it's not -- it's not worth it because they really

14

don't expect to get -- they don't think anybody is going

15

to infringe, in the first place, and if they did what

16

establishes to be, just wouldn't be economically

though, of the solution that Congress adopted with the

21

registration, moving the registration to a

22

jurisdictional element rather than to an element of the

claim, as it was in the 19th century, is that the

24

copyright owner may do this any time.

Sixty-nine years after my death,

2

my heirs could register my copyright if they are finding

3

that somebody is now making a lot of money off of my

5

against that person.

And they could then bring an infringement suit

6

It's odd to think of a jurisdictional

7

restriction as being a looser element than a claim

element, but in this particular story of copyright, it

What Congress did was to say, we want people

What will happen in this case under the

23

terms of this settlement is that the defendant who did

24

not take time to find the owners of these works, even

25

though the owners of these works were easier to find

Alderson Reporting Company

1

than many of the very elusive of works that archives and

2

historical societies search for, they did not find -

3

look for the owners because they thought it would be too

4

difficult.

5

This settlement now gives the defendants a

6

perpetual right to use all of those works without ever

7

identifying the owners, and without the owners ever

8

being identified on the national copyright register,

9

which is what Congress wanted.

10

If I want to create a competing database for

11

any of the defendants, I have to undertake the arduous

12

work of tracking down all the owners.

what Congress was trying to do was to give people like

5

that we could find the owner of the book on slavery.

6

And, as a way to maintain that register,

7

which Congress started in 1790, it said, to the authors

of copyrighted works, if you want to use our courts, the

are not -- they are not intended to give legal advice to

counsel about what the issues in the case are.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I suppose, if you picked

up any copyright complaint, you will see the

jurisdictional allegation will say 1331, 1338, and

16

nothing about 411.

17

MS. JONES MERRITT:

And that is quite

18

common, Your Honor, because, in many situations, what

19

Congress has done is given a general grant of

20

jurisdiction in 1331 or 1338 and then pulled it back for

21

a subcategory of cases, which is what 411(a) does.

22

In those circumstances, not just in

copyright, but in all sorts of areas, the complaint will

plead jurisdiction under the general grant and then may

responsibly and without taking the Court's time.

13

Now, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, you said a

14

couple of times that you wonder whether the language

15

here, "No action shall be instituted," doesn't sound

16

jurisdictional, and exactly to the contrary, the Court's

17

decision of Jones v. Bock, which, I think -- if I am

18

remembering, you authored, but, in any event, it was

19

within a year or two, said that was boilerplate language

20

used all the time for statutes of limitations that are

21

not jurisdictional.

And, indeed, that is correct.

22

In the footnote of our reply brief, we list

23

three times in the 19th century when that very language

24

was used for statutes of limitations.

25

it into LEXIS or Westlaw, you will get a zillion

And, if you put

statutes with respect to -- exhaust nonjurisdictional

2

statutes.

3

So I think, quite to the contrary, that -

4

that is the language Congress uses when it wants

5

something to be not jurisdictional.

6

Now, Ms. Merritt began with the word

7

"shall," in 411(a).

I want to be clear.

This case was

8

instituted in compliance with 411(a).

9

plaintiffs registered their works and came into court.

The named

10

It went to mediation, and the next thing the court knew,

11

it had a settlement agreement to review, and it did

12

review under Rule 23.

13

She relies on the Hallstrom case, but, of

14

course, the Hallstrom case, which did avoid saying

15

whether it was mandatory or jurisdictional, involved the

16

enforcement of a mandatory -- at least mandatory rule,

17

on the application of a party, and that's what the Court

18

does, and that's why, to some extent, other than with

19

respect to settlement agreements, this case doesn't

20

matter a lot because the defendants will always be

21

raising this defense.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

23

Ms. Merritt, you were appointed by this

24

Court as an amicus to defend the judgment below, and you

25

have ably discharged that responsibility.
