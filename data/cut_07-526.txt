ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Congress squarely addressed and

11

unambiguously answered the first question in this case

12

when it enacted the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.

13

It authorized the Secretary to take land in trust for

14

Indians, and it declared, as used in this Act, Indians

15

were "members of any recognized Indian tribe now under

16

Federal jurisdiction."

17

meaning in 1934 as it does every morning in this Court

18

when the Marshal announces that "The Court is now

19

sitting."

20

The word "now" had the same

When Congress said "now under Federal

21

jurisdiction," it did not mean "then under Federal

22

jurisdiction," but that is what the Government contends.

23

In fact, the word "then" is the antonym for "now."

24

"Now" must be given its ordinary meaning, which the

25

Government concedes on -- in its brief, is the date,

There are many contexts in which one could

conceivably, but the context would tell you.

23

the Government's -- one of the Government's examples is

24

the use of the word "now" in a will.

25

everyone knows the will speaks as of the date of the

In fact,

Of course,

passage of the individual.

2

the statute where the Government refers to that, and the

3

statute itself has a very clear, different meaning.

4

There's another reference in

My reference to the statute and the use of

5

the word "now" in this statute is very, very clear.

"now" are consistent.

14

the word "now" would have no meaning in that statute.

15

The

It refers to tribes "now under
All of those uses of the word
If the Government was correct,

I think it was interesting, if one takes the

16

question presented as articulated by the Government, it

17

says, "Whether the Indian Reorganization Act authorizes

18

the Interior Secretary to take into trust on behalf of

19

an Indian tribe that was not recognized" -- "a not

20

recognized Indian tribe under Federal jurisdiction on

21

June 18th, 1934," if you take that word "not" and strike

22

it out of the question presented, you get the statute.

23

So, what the Government is asking for is the

24

exact opposite of what the statute clearly requires.

25

And all one has to do is look at the question presenting
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

-- presented as -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about -- what

3

about the additional definition in section 19 of

4

"tribe," which is not limited the way the first sentence

5

is?

6

MR. OLSON:

But it says, Chief Justice

7

Roberts, it says "Indian tribe."

8

in that very section, at the very beginning of the

9

section, says "the term 'Indian' as used in this Act,"

10

blah, blah, blah.

11

it refers to "Indian tribe."

And the word "Indian,"

So then, later in that same section,

12

It's important to juxtapose section 5, which

13

is codified as 465, and section 19, which is codified as

14

479, to look at the statute.

15

5 authorizes the Secretary to take land for Indians.

16

Now, the way the Government addresses that in the

17

Government's brief, they took the word "tribe" at the -

18

towards the end of Section 465 and said the statute

19

authorizes taking land for tribes.

20

taking land for Indians, and then in the latter part of

21

section 5, it says "title" -- "When property is taken

22

for Indians, title may be vested in an individual Indian

23

or in a tribe."

24

Congress very carefully said, "As used in this Act, the

25

term 'Indian' shall mean" what we've been talking about

The first part of section

It actually says

Then when you get to section 19,

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

here today, and that's an adjective that describes

2

"tribe" later in the sentence.

3

There's two things that the Government does

4

in their brief which I find very interesting.

5

all, the Government says the use of the word "Indian"

6

doesn't necessarily mean Indians.

7

First of

But Title I, section 1, of the United States

8

Code, the first sentence in the United States Code,

9

says:

"The word 'singular'" -- "The word 'singular'

10

shall include the plural, and the plural shall include

11

the word 'singular.'"

12

So the United States is disregarding that

13

maxim.

14

something different.

15

ignore the singular or plural.

16

that the Government does is to ask you to understand

17

that the word "Indian" means something when it's a noun

18

and something else when it's an adjective, violating

19

another primary construct -- construction, statutory

20

construction.

21

Of course, the context can always indicate
But the Government asks you to

JUSTICE ALITO:

And then the other thing

Doesn't it have to be

22

correct because in -- in section 19 it says that the

23

term "Indian" means, among other things, all other

24

persons of one-half or more Indian blood.

25

of "Indian" there can't be limited.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, the use

It would be

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

circular if that definition applied to the use of that

2

adjective there.

3

MR. OLSON:

The -- the -- yes.

I understand

4

that, Justice Alito, and -- and no statute, if you -- if

5

you come along 70 years later, is it not possible to

6

find something like that.

7

consistent way to look at that term throughout the

8

statute -- and I would say, first of all, it's the

9

language of the statute.

But the fact is that the only

It's the context of the words

10

in the statute where the word "Indian" has to mean

11

certain things.

12

It has to have some limitation.

Otherwise,

13

the Secretary can do anything, and -- and Congress

certainly didn't intend that.

momentarily.

MR. OLSON:

So it was natural,

Official - Subject to Final Review

fashion.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My understanding -

3

maybe I've got this wrong, but there was not then, as

4

there is now, a list of tribes that are recognized and

5

under Federal jurisdiction.

6

in 1934 who is under Federal jurisdiction?

7

MR. OLSON:

So how -- how do you tell

Well, what the Interior

8

Department did was, in compliance with the statute -

9

was to set about and create a list.

There was a list

10

created in 1936, as I understand it, Chief Justice

11

Roberts.

12

a List Act.

There was subsequent legislation that has even

13

But the -- what -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I guess the

15

point is that, given the weight that you are placing on

16

the word "now," you would think there was some clear way

17

to say who was recognized before then and who was

18

recognized after that.

19

the test of recognition was in 1934.

And I -- I just don't know what

20

But if they were drawing -- if Congress were

21

drawing a sharp line, presumably, it would be based on a

22

sharp distinction; and, yet, as I understand it, there

23

is no real sharp distinction.

24
25

MR. OLSON:
sharp distinction.

Well, there was a relatively

That is to say, it was Indians that
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

had treaties with the United States, or tribes that had

2

treaties with the United States, or had been recognized

3

in some fashion by the United States Government in terms

4

of a relationship between the Government of the United

5

States and the Indian tribes.

6

Now, the Federal Register and Federal

7

records in 1934 were not what they are today, and that's

8

the reason why, when these words were used, the Interior

9

Department set about to look through the history of the

10

Interior Department and to come up with a list of tribes

11

that would have been covered, would have been embraced,

12

by that term now recognized in 1934.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we're told that that

14

-- that effort was ridden -- ridden with mistakes.

15

could you have, under your definition, a tribe that is

16

recognized relatively recently, whether it is about 16,

17

but that was, in fact, a tribe in 1934; that is, the -

18

although it wasn't formally recognized until later, it

19

was, in fact, a tribe in 1934?

20

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

So

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

In

21

fact, to the extent that it's necessary to go back and

22

-- and it happened on a few occasions subsequent to 1934

23

that historical records were reviewed, relationships

24

between the tribe and the Federal Government were

25

reviewed.

In fact, in the Government's brief, the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Government talks about three tribes for which land was

2

taken into trust that didn't fit the definition of now

3

recognized -- tribes recognized in 1934.

4

We went back and looked at two of those

5

three tribes where -- in fact did have treaties with the

6

United States and would have been included.

7

would have probably been included and could be included

8

just exactly the way you suggested in your question.

9

The other

The other point that I think is very

10

important to emphasize is that 15 times since the

11

enactment of this statute Congress has acted

12

specifically to apply the Indian Reorganization Act to

13

an Indian tribe that had not been covered in 1934,

14

evidencing some congressional understanding that it -

15

it took an act of Congress to bring a particular tribe

16

under the Act.

17

There is these -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, I suppose if the

18

phrase "now under the jurisdiction of the United States"

19

did not have any clear meaning when the statute was

20

enacted, it -- it wouldn't have any clear meaning for

21

the future, either.

22

that problem by reading "now" to mean "then," right?

23

So you don't -- you don't solve

MR. OLSON:

Well, what -- what -- I think I

24

understand your question.

What the Government wants to

25

do is just take the word "now" out of the statute
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

altogether.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

I'm saying it doesn't

help if you do what the Government suggests.

doesn't give any clearer content to the meaning of being

5

under Federal jurisdiction.

system.

14

you don't -- you know, maybe you shouldn't be on the

it was intended -- members of Congress had to think the

And then he explains

exactly what was meant by that:

would -- he says that would limit the Act to Indians now

13

Collier to all of the superintendents throughout the

descent who are members of any recognized tribe that was

Now your point, Chief Justice Roberts, is

19

that maybe it was unclear at the exact moment of -- of

20

enactment which 198, or whatever number it might have

21

been, tribes were under that, but that's the sort of

information that can be discerned by looking at the

It refers, in the second-to-last

And I think -- but nonetheless,

Justice Scalia, for the purposes of this, it is quite

20

clear that if you were a member of Congress in 1934

21

reading this statute and seeing the words "now or

22

hereafter" meaning now or sometime afterwards and seeing

23

the words "now pending," "now recognized," "now

existing," and so forth, you would think that the word

25

"now" meant 1934.

In fact, when this Court in 1978 was

MR. OLSON:

Both, Justice Kennedy.

They

weren't either.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because I suppose that

what the Government wants us to do is put in two commas:

7

The Indian as used in section -- a person of Indian

8

descent, comma, who are members of any recognized Indian

tribes, comma, now under Federal jurisdiction.

That

still might not help if they weren't under Federal

jurisdiction in 1934.

That's correct.

And that's the section you're talking

about -- 19?

What section are we talking

Stevens?

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

"The term 'tribe' wherever used
22

in this Act shall be construed to refer to any Indian

tribe."

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

MR. OLSON:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6
7

Right.

So, the word "Organized band, pueblo,

or the Indians residing on one reservation."
MR. OLSON:

I submit that, for purposes of

8

construction of the statute and using the word

9

consistently, the word "Indian" modifies tribe, the word

10

"Indian" as defined, that's consistent with the purpose,

11

that's consistent with the legislative history.

12

consistent with the construction -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's

The word "Indian" does not

14

modify the word "tribe" as used in the third sentence.

15

That's my point.

16

MR. OLSON:

Well, I think you and I must be

17

reading a different thing because the sentence that -

18

the sentence that defines the word "Indian" says "the

19

term 'Indian' as used" -

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm saying for purposes of

21

getting the meaning of the word "tribe," just look at

22

the sentence defining that term, and that doesn't refer

23

to any time limit.

24
25

MR. OLSON:

But it does include the word

"Indian," which does have a temporal limitation.

construction of the statute, including the way this

10

Court read it in 1978, the history, the purpose that it

11

was intended to accomplish, the use of those words

throughout the statute which are consistent, all

13

supports the proposition that it had meant Indian tribes

recognized and under Federal jurisdiction.

separately defined in the Act.

6

looks to the definition of "Indian" in section 19, the

best reading of "now" in the first definitional example

8

is at the time that the Act is applied.

9

First, section 5 authorizes the

Second, even if one

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so the statute

10

reads the same whether "now" is in there or not?

11

read it as saying any recognized Indian tribe under

Federal jurisdiction.

13

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

You

And I think

14

that if you look at the legislative colloquy, it -- it

15

only makes sense, the addition of "now under Federal

jurisdiction," if what they meant by that was to use it

at the time the Act is invoked.

So you're saying the

only way that makes sense is to read it as if it weren't

22

there.

23

MS. MAYNARD:

Ironically, Your Honor, I

24

think the Congress added the term "now under Federal

25

jurisdiction" to the Act, yes, to make clear that it 25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it was a contemporaneous application of the term.

2

Senator Wheeler was concerned about Indians who were

3

already under Federal jurisdiction, and he said sooner

4

or later they must have come out from under the Act.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure he was,

6

because when I looked through that whole thing it seemed

7

to me what they were worried about -- Senator Thomas was

8

worried about remnants of tribes, and they were talking

9

about an example of the Catawba Indians in South

10

Carolina, and they had a discussion about that; and then

11

it seemed everybody on the committee agreed that these

12

Catawba Indians should not be included if they were only

13

one quarter Indian.

14

were half Indian.

15

within the other phrase, not the phrase that we are

16

talking about.

17

They should be included if they
And that meant that they had to fall

So then they say how do we get this result?

18

I mean, because they are a tribe.

19

certainly a tribe and they are recognized, the Catawbas.

20

And then the answer to that was -- what's his name -

21

the Collier -- Collier.

22

how:

23

And he thought what he was doing was ruling out the

24

Catawbas and only allowing the half Indians to come in.

25

Because they are

Collier says:

I'll tell you

We add the words "now under Federal jurisdiction."

Now, ironically, later on, in the '40s I
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think, the government decides that the Catawba tribe is

2

in fact under Federal jurisdiction in 1934 because a

3

treaty exists.

4

Anyway, that's how I read it and the

5

California Indians were quite secondary to what they

6

were talking about.

7

whether they were under a tribe or not a tribe or

8

anything.

9

They didn't -- they didn't know

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, the colloquy is

10

certainly not clear, Justice Breyer.

11

that.

12
13
14

I'll grant you

But I do think the best reading JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought it was fairly

clear.
MS. MAYNARD:

I -- I think the best reading

15

of it is that Commissioner Collier is addressing Senator

16

Wheeler's concern, not the earlier concern about the

17

Catawbas, because he says "Senator Wheeler" -- "Senator

18

Wheeler, will this not address your concern?"

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but they -- I mean,

20

Senator Wheeler was worried about the Catawbas.

21

Wheeler decides, okay, the half-Indian Catawbas fall in,

22

but the quarter-Indian Catawbas don't.

23

MS. MAYNARD:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MS. MAYNARD:

Then

My memory of it I'll go back to it.

My memory is that it was a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

interesting conversation?

the Congress?

5

members wasn't a Congressman, right?

6

MS. MAYNARD:

7

Was it even on the floor of

It couldn't have been, because one of the

hearing, Your Honor.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was at a hearing, oh.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

You learn a lot at

10

hearings, actually.

11

MS. MAYNARD:

But if I could, going back to

12

the text, Justice Scalia, the text of the Act

13

independently support the Secretary's reading for three

14

reasons, the third being that even if one reads "now" in

15

the first definitional -- in the first definition to

16

mean unambiguously June 18, 1934, the definition by its

17

terms is expressly inclusive, setting forth the category

18

of people that the Secretary must include but not

19

limiting the Secretary to -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He can include anybody

21

else?

22

one quarter-Indian blood, even though, you know, they

23

went to the trouble of defining it as 50 percent Indian

24

blood?

25

He can include, for example, people who are only

MS. MAYNARD:

I think that would be a

more -

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Very strange statute, just

leaving it up to him to do whatever he wants.

4

MS. MAYNARD:

I think the proper way of

5

reading, as this Court said, definitions that start with

6

"shall include" is that they are illustrative examples

7

of a general group.

8
9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:
limitations.

It includes this and it also includes

whatever else he wants.

11

So -- so there is no

MS. MAYNARD:

Is that it?
No, Your Honor; I think an

12

illustrative example of a general class, it would be

13

persons listed like the listed person.

14

the quarter blood would be more difficult, perhaps.

15

here what the Secretary has done is include within the

16

meaning of "Indians" persons who are every bit as much

17

an Indian as those who were members of recognized tribes

18

under Federal jurisdiction in 1934.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You example of
But

That's -- that's a very

20

strange reading of "shall include" when you're dealing

21

with a word that does not itself have any solid content.

22

When you're dealing with a word that's pretty much

23

self-defining, yes, you can say "shall include this,"

24

because what in addition is included is -- is pretty

25

clear.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But these words have virtually no -- no

2

content; and if you say "shall include" means, you know,

3

it has this, I'm still left with well, what else does it

4

have?

5

that expansive, to let the Secretary buy land for

6

whomever he wanted.

7

I can't believe that the statute was meant to be

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, it doesn't do that, Your

8

Honor.

I think both -- both the definitions of -- of

9

"tribe," for example as Justice Stevens points out,

10

"tribe" is a separately defined term; and I don't think

11

you can work the statute in the plain text way that

12

Mr. Olson suggests.

13

everywhere it appears in the statute and plug in the

14

definition of "Indian."

15

the definition of "Indian" itself, which uses the

16

adjective "Indian" to define the term "Indian" four

17

times.

18

You can't take the word "Indian"

And that's proven by looking at

So you can't take JUSTICE STEVENS:

Ms. Maynard, would you

that have the meaning that it includes descendants who

are less than a half-blood, quarter-blood, eighth-blood

straightforward reading of that would be any descendant

The descendants.

Yes, we

5

interpret that to be descendants who were living on the

6

reservation on June 1, 1934, but they wouldn't even have

7

to be members of tribes, and there would be no blood

8

quantum requirement.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, so you're

10

applying now, when you're talking about who is of Indian

11

descent -

12

MS. MAYNARD:

No, Your Honor.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- Indian descent of

14

those in 1934, but not when it's determining -- in other

15

words, you say the Indian descent as of when?

16

MS. MAYNARD:

Descendants who were on June

17

1st, 1934.

That's not using -- that's not applying the

18

definition of the word "now."

19

very different phrase, the second phrase, where Congress

20

used a date when it meant a date in 1934 -

That's in fact using a

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MS. MAYNARD:

In fact, if you look at the verbs in the

25

"are":

"Are members of recognized Indian tribes," "are

And I think the best reading of "now" in

5

context -- and Mr. Olson has pointed you to several

6

places in the text where they use "now" in very

7

different clauses: "now pending," "now or hereafter" -

8

and -- but in two places in the Act, and that's why I do

9

think it's important to look at the Act itself, Justice

10

Scalia, because this hasn't been codified into positive

law.

13

this Act."

Well, the Court wasn't

resolving the meaning of the first definition in John,

have to admit I'm pretty much moved by the fact that

7

they thought that's what it meant.

9

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, apart from the Collier

memo, which I would like to address, the Secretary when

10

administering this Act has uniformly, since the

11

beginning, applied the definition that applies today.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I could only find one

13

instance, which is that Biloxi tribe, where the -

14

something, you know, the ones in Louisiana -- aside from

15

that instance, I have not found one other instance that

16

is inconsistent with the words "now under Federal

17

jurisdiction" meaning Federal jurisdiction in 1934.

20
21

I don't know If you want to list them,

I'll look them up.

I don't know that the

Secretary has ever undertaken to make such a list.

23

There was no list at the time.

24

forward-looking act in its view of organized tribes and

25

by its nature assumed that there would be no tribes.

And the Act was a

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But in the 1930s and 1940s, the Solicitor's opinions

2

that we cite and discuss in our brief apply the question

3

of whether a group is a tribe who can organize under

4

section 16 or can have land taken into trust for them

5

under section 5.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I believe that's organized

7

or recognized, because what they did in several cases, I

8

found, like the one, the Stillaquamish or whatever, they

9

said, yes, we recognize them now.

They weren't

10

recognized in 1934, but they were under Federal

11

jurisdiction in 1934 because there were treaties that

12

applied between the Federal Government and the Indians

13

which gave these Indians rights then.

14

seems consistent with what -- what Collier and the

15

others say.

16

MS. MAYNARD:

And that -- that

My understanding is that the

17

Secretary interprets "recognized" and "under Federal

18

jurisdiction" to not have much difference with respect

19

to tribes.

20

the Court of Appeals suggested this might have more

21

content when you're talking about individuals, and that

makes more sense -

apply to both.

Justice Breyer was suggesting, as I had

earlier, that maybe you can make a distinction between

those were under Federal jurisdiction then and

recognized tribes now.

And possibly you could.

I

whether a tribe could reorganize or have land taken into

the same definitional -- definitions apply as to whether

11

or not the tribe was a tribe at the time the Secretary

was applying that decision.

This is -- we are

talking about an extraordinary assertion of power.

As I said earlier,

Well, there may -- there

may not be, but let me on that score, take you back to

an answer that Mr. Olson gave.

9

Assume for the moment, for the sake of the

10

question, that we were to read this the way Justice

11

Kennedy and Justice Breyer suggested, and that is to

draw a distinction between the reference -- the now

that the now refers to jurisdiction and it refers to the

representation that Mr. Olson -- I think Mr. Olson's

I believe that the Secretary's

21

beginning of the 1930s and '40s the opinions show that

view to the one definitional example in the IRA, then

to decide whether "now" happens to mean 1934 or "now"
