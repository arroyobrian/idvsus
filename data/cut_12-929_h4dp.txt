 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

Construction Company v. The United States District Court 

6

for the Western District of Texas.

 Mr. Hastings. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAMS S. HASTINGS 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Forum selection clauses have been frequently 

13

used in contracts of all types.  They should be enforced 

14

as written, and the enforcement of a contractual forum 

15

selection clause should not just be left to convenience 

16

discretionary balancing tests. 

17

 Rule 12(b)(3), in Section 1406 of the United 

18

States Code, provide appropriate and effective means for 

19

enforcing a contractual forum selection clause.  The 

20

language of those provisions is written broadly. 

21

Congress used words like "wrong," and the rule uses the 

22

word "improper," which have plain and natural meanings 

23

that are broad and are sufficient to authorize district 

24

courts to act to enforce the contractual clause. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is  is it common in the

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

treatises or in the cases to say that a forum selection 

2

clause is a venue provision?  I thought venue was 

3

something that Congress determined. 

4

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Your Honor, the cases do 

5

discuss it as a venue provision.  One example would be 

6

this Court's decision in Stewart addressed a forum 

7

selection clause in a 1404(a) transfer analysis, which 

8

is clearly a venue analysis.  In addition to that, with 

9

the 2011 amendments to the United States Code, Congress 

10

adopted a definition of venue.  It's in Section 1390. 

11

That definition says the place of litigation.  I'm 

12

paraphrasing it, but it's  it's a pretty 

13

straightforward definition. 

14

 The legislative history of Section 201 of 

15

that Act acknowledges that the definition was intended 

16

to make venue determinations easier and to make it 

17

clearer that parties could waive or adjust these types 

18

of provisions even by contract.  The words "by 

19

contract." 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In the Stewart case to which 

21

you just referred, the court said, "The parties do not 

22

dispute that the district court properly denied the 

23

motion to dismiss the case for improper venue under 

24

1406(a)" because Respondent apparently does business in 

25

the Northern District of Alabama, which was not the

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause. 
 So what  if we were to write an opinion in 
your favor, what would you suggest we say about that? 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

Your Honor, I believe the 

5

correct reading of that language is what the Second 

6

Circuit has said in the trade comment decision, and 

7

others have written on this, that Stewart and  and the 

8

text read by that footnote.  That's footnote 8, I 

9

believe.  The text right there said, "The immediate 

10

issue is how we address 1404(a)." 

11

 And the way the majority of the circuit 

12

courts have read it is the issue in Stewart, this 

13

procedural issue that we're here on today, which is 

14

simply not presented to the Court. 

15

 And so the Court could very easily write a 

16

decision that acknowledges Stewart still controls on a 

17

1404(a) analysis, but acknowledged that, like the majority 

18

of the circuits, that Stewart simply did not have to 

19

address this problem. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that's  that's true, 

21

but it means that the entire discussion in Stewart is 

22

beside the point.  The Court wrote a decision about an 

23

issue that really never should arise because the party 

24

seeking  as you see it, the party seeking to enforce 

25

the forum selection clause should proceed under 1406.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So Stewart said, well, if  if you proceed 

2

under the wrong provision, this is how it should come 

3

out.  It makes the whole decision essentially 

4

meaningless, doesn't it? 

5

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Justice Alito, I respectfully 

6

disagree.  And here's what the meaning of Stewart would 

7

be, as  as we understand it.  First of all, under the 

8

facts of Stewart, the same situation would arise, of 

9

course, if a party waived their proper venue objection. 

10

That may be a narrow line of cases, but that would still 

11

apply in a case where a party doesn't assert the 

12

contract at first. 

13

 But there's another place where Stewart 

14

would still apply, when a case is filed in the proper 

15

jurisdiction.  Here, if this lawsuit had been filed in 

16

Virginia, there would be a very limited place for 

17

exceptional circumstances for a court to look at a 

18

1404(a) analysis and determine if public interest 

19

required something other than the contract clause. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I don't see how that 

21

would  I don't see how that would work.  You're 

22

this is the argument you made in your reply brief, that 

23

if this  if the case had been filed in the 

24

jurisdiction specified in the forum selection clause, 

25

that court could nevertheless proceed under 1404(a) and

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

transfer it back to the Western District of Texas, for 

2

example.  That's  that's your argument, right? 

3
4
5

 MR. HASTINGS: 

In exceptional cases, Your 

Honor. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In exceptional cases.  But 

6

1404(a) says that it can  a case can be transferred to 

7

a district where it might have been brought.  And your 

8

argument under 1406 is that they couldn't be brought in 

9

the Western District of Texas, that's a place where 

10
11

there's a wrong venue. 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Your Honor, the language 

12

of the statutes, particularly, the language you were 

13

just referring to about "might have been brought," needs 

14

to be read in context of decisions from this Court.  In 

15

Van Dusen, this Court held that that language "might 

16

have been brought" was a term of art. 

17

 The Court has never reached that conclusion 

18

with respect to wrong or improper.  And in Van Dusen, 

19

the Court said the "might have been brought" language 

20

was a term of art referring back to a congressionally 

21

chosen venue under 1391. 

22

 And so, when this plays out under 1404(a), 

23

the court  if the case is in the proper venue and 

24

we're on to the second issue of 1404(a), the proper 

25

reading of the language would allow the court, truly

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in exceptional circumstances, to follow  follow the 

2

language of the statute and send it to another place 

3

where Congress said the case could have been. 

4

 And, again, this is really the second issue 

5

in the case.  We would emphasize that it's truly 

6

exceptional cases where parties had contracted for a 

7

forum, they've truly resolved the conveniences among the 

8

parties among themselves. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Hastings, Section 1391 

10

says the following, "Except as otherwise provided by 

11

law"  not by contract  "by law, this section shall 

12

govern"  shall govern  "the venue of all"  "all 

13

civil actions brought in district courts of the United 

14

States."  And then it goes on to specify certain rules 

15

for where venue in a case can lie. 

16

 So if I'm looking at that, I'm thinking, 

17

well, those rules apply.  And they can't be reversed or 

18

countermanded or whatever by  by contract, by parties' 

19

agreement, except to the extent that the contract can 

20

figure centrally into the 1404 analysis.  But it's not 

21

appropriate in the 1406 analysis because  you know, 

22

the statute says what the statute says.  Here is venue. 

23

 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Your Honor, the language 

24

of Section 1391, and the first part, I believe it's 

25

1391(a) where it has the language of "shall govern in

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

federal courts," that's really no different than what 

2

this Court said in Stewart of Federal law controls venue 

3

in Federal courts. 

4

 But the issue that comes up is that venue 

5

venue is very important.  Venue, even before the current 

6

statutes were written, was recognized as being a 

7

privilege for the litigants.  They're to protect the 

8

defendants.  And even in Neirbo, in the 1939, so almost 

9

a decade before the  some of the current statutes were 

10

written, this Court said venue was subject to 

11

disposition by the parties. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's only  what that 

13

tells us is that venue is a highly waiverable thing. 

14

You can stand on your venue right, but you don't have 

15

to. 

16

 My problem with your interpretation is you 

17

are allowing a private agreement to make a venue 

18

prescription that Congress enacted improper.  Congress 

19

said it was proper.  It may be that it should not apply 

20

in this case because the parties have consented to 

21

something else, but it's not a wrong venue. 

22

 I mean, suppose the question had never come 

23

up.  The  there wasn't a claim that this was a wrong 

24

venue.  The  the case could have proceeded, and it 

25

would have been a place of proper venue, right?

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Your Honor, if there was no 

objection raised, yes. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it doesn't become 

4

it's a place of proper venue.  There may be a reason why 

5

another venue is the one that should control in this 

6

case, but you can't make a private agreement  can't 

7

say what Congress says is proper is improper. 

8
9

 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Your Honor, in response 

to that, first of all, the venue rights have always 

10

been, like many Federal rights, waiverable provisions. 

11

And when a contract 

12
13
14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That doesn't mean it's 

improper.  It means it's waiverable. 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Your Honor, the language 

15

of the word "improper," improper is a broad term, and it 

16

has a broad meaning.  I'd like to focus on "improper" 

17

for just a second.  We have two different words, 

18

"improper" and "wrong."  But "improper" is used in 

19

12(b)(3). 

20

 Congress didn't  or  and the courts did 

21

not explain what that applies.  In practice, that word 

22

is used for many different contexts.  It's used to 

23

enforce forum selection clauses.  The majority of the 

24

circuit courts  in fact, more circuits than have 

25

weighed in on our favor use that language to enforce

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

foreign clauses and clauses requiring State court 

2

forums.  It's used in a very broad context in order to 

3

enforce people's contract rights.  It's even used in 

4

arbitration context. 

5

 Although the FAA gives parties the right to 

6

move under the FAA, many parties raise their complaints 

7

under the 12(b)(3) because of the procedural impact of 

8

12(b) motions, allowing parties not to have to answer 

9

complicated Federal cases and get to proceed to 

10
11

arbitration more quickly. 
 Giving the language a plain and natural 

12

meaning allows the courts to, essentially, do justice 

13

and allow to streamline and have efficient running of 

14

cases and to enforce parties' rights in contracts. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So what 
Mr. Hastings, I wonder what 

17

you think of this analogy.  Any party can waive a 

18

personal jurisdiction defense, but would you say that 

19

parties by contract can create personal jurisdiction in 

20

a court in which it otherwise doesn't exist? 

21

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Your Honor, personal 

22

jurisdiction is  is also essentially a personal right 

23

of the defendant.  And so if the defendant is willing to 

24

consent to personal jurisdiction, as often happens in 

25

contracts 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, as I said, anybody can 

2

waive it.  Just like anybody can waive almost everything 

3

in our  in  in the way the Federal rules work.  But 

4

do you think that parties can actually create personal 

5

jurisdiction where it doesn't exist by law? 

6

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Focusing on personal 

7

jurisdiction, not subject matter jurisdiction, yes, 

8

because parties can consent and contract to waive the 

9

personal jurisdiction objections.  And, Your Honor, I 

10

believe that has been recognized by many of the circuit 

11

courts. 

12
13
14
15
16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Because consent is a 

basis for personal jurisdiction. 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

Exactly, Your Honor.  Just 

like 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Could  could I ask, what 

17

difference would it make to you if  if I thought the 

18

venue here is proper, but I thought that there  there 

19

was no cause of action in this circuit, and the case 

20

as one of the amicus briefs proposed.  What difference 

21

would that make to you? 

22

 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Justice Scalia, that 

23

would  Professor Sachs' brief certainly makes that 

24

argument.  I would begin by acknowledging that that rule 

25

would be far better than leaving this to discretionary

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

balancing tests. 
 What difference it would make, it actually 

3

would be very favorable to my client because this case 

4

would have to be dismissed.  We have concerns about that 

5

rule.  That's why we didn't push that as our argument. 

6

The circuits have a threeway split. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Isn't that  that's a 

8

problem with the argument.  Both 1404(a) and 1406 

9

provide for transfer.  This Court has emphasized that 

10

it's one Federal system, and within the Federal system, 

11

the result shouldn't be dismissed, bring the case all 

12

over again, pay a new filing fee; instead of that, just 

13

transfer to the appropriate forum.  And that's what 

14

Professor Sachs' view leaves out because the result, as 

15

you say, is  it's only dismissal, no transfer. 

16

 MR. HASTINGS: And Justice Ginsburg,that is one 

17

of the  one of the concerns with the rule.  But 

18

Professor Sachs' approach does, first of all, start off 

19

with a strong benefit of enforcing contracts.  It's just 

20

not as effective as 12(b)(3), because when we are 

21

dealing with what's really a venue issue 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  But what if 

23

there is no personal jurisdiction, okay, and the  and 

24

the suit is dismissed because there is no personal 

25

jurisdiction.  Would a Federal court transfer it to 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

to another court that has personal jurisdiction? 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

Your Honor, under the current 

3

statutes, I believe the court would have the discretion 

4

to transfer it based upon personal jurisdiction. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Where  it's  1404(a) 

6

and 1406 deal with venue.  They don't deal with personal 

7

jurisdiction. 

8
9

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Your Honor, many  many 

courts have actually read 1406 to also allow for 

10

addressing personal jurisdiction.  There's a circuit 

11

split on that issue. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Hastings, has 12(b)(6) 

13

ever been used to your knowledge to deal with a case in 

14

which the question is which court the plaintiff should 

15

have brought the suit in, rather than whether the 

16

plaintiff has a viable claim in any court? 

17

 MR. HASTINGS: 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes 
Because it seems to me a bit 

19

of a category error.  The 12(b)(6) is something  it's 

20

an onthemerits determination about the viability of 

21

your claim.  It has res judicata effect, whereas this is 

22

not.  This is just a question of, did you bring the 

23

thing in the right place and you should be allowed to 

24

bring it someplace else. 

25

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Justice Kagan, the First

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Circuit has been using the 12(b)(6) approach to address 

2

whether the case is in the right 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, I know the courts have been. 

4

I'm saying, except for this kind of case, has a court 

5

ever used 12(b)(6) to deal with a case of which court? 

6
7
8
9
10
11

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Outside of the forum 

selection clause context 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Or to deal with anything 

that's not an onthemerits determination that precludes 
a case in any court? 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Your Honor, I'm not 

12

aware of a court doing it outside of the context of the 

13

forum selection clause issue, as the First Circuit 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I have one question here. 

15

It seems  because I start out for reasons I won't go 

16

into thinking, well, perhaps it doesn't matter, frankly; 

17

you can get to the same result under any one of these 

18

three approaches. 

19

 But then one thing Professor Sachs says does 

20

bother me, that if we take your approach, then how do we 

21

deal with the problem of removal?  I mean, you can only 

22

remove a case to a court which is in the district where 

23

the person  the plaintiff filed.  Now, if there is a 

24

forum selection clause, the defendant seems to me to be 

25

stuck, because he can't go to a  he can't go to a 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

to another. 
 He can't go to another court. 

He can't go 

3

to the court within the district because of the forum 

4

selection clause, and he can't go into another court 

5

because of 1441(a).  So that argues to me that we ought 

6

to either take the 1404 approach, or we ought to take 

7

Professor Sachs' approach, unless you have an answer to 

8

that. 

9

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Justice Breyer, I do have an 

10

answer to the removal issue.  And the answer starts in 

11

Section 1390(c).  And in 1390(c), Congress said 

12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
can I find that? 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

Chief Justice Roberts, it's 

28 U.S. Code 1390(c). 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It's not 

conveniently set forth in any of the papers, right? 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

No, Your Honor, it's not.  I 

did not know that this issue was going to come up. 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

 MR. HASTINGS: 

22

Where can  where 

Fair enough. 

With respect to 1390(c), 

Congress said 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

24

 MR. HASTINGS: 

25

 Congress said that these rules, with the

1390(c)? 
Yes, sir.  Yes, Your Honor. 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exception of the transfer rules, do not apply in removal 

2

cases.  Congress has answered the question.  Removal 

3

procedure is governed by the statutes on removal, and, 

4

yes, if you are in State court, there is one court you 

5

can remove to.  This rule and this issue doesn't change 

6

that. 

7

 But if you  if this case had been filed in 

8

Texas State court, for example, and was removed to the 

9

Western District, 1390(c) still says that the transfer 

10

rules  it doesn't say 1404(a); it says the transfer 

11

rules, which would also pick up 1406  could still 

12

apply to reallocate the venue for the lawsuit if there 

13

was a contract clause or if it was 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You didn't really 

15

explain  I'm sorry.  I'll read it more carefully 

16

later.  But how  it says you have to  you have to 

17

remove to the court or the district and division where 

18

the place of action is pending, so if it's filed in 

19

State court in Texas, you have to remove to the Texas 

20

Federal court.  Now, how do we get  and you can't go 

21

to the Texas Federal court, according to you, because of 

22

the contract. 

23
24
25

 Okay. 

Now, how  now, you explain how 

how this provision over 1390(c) gets around that? 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Justice Breyer, I would

17

Alderson Reporting Company

respectfully disagree about whether you can get to the 

2

Texas court. 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, you  in other 

4

words, you can remove to the Texas court, even though it 

5

says you can remove  you can remove to the district 

6

court despite the contract. 

7
8
9
10

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Yes, Justice Breyer, 

because 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

Despite the contract. 
Because of the specific 

11

Federal statutes allowing for removal.  They tell 

12

specifically where the removal must go, and so we're not 

13

suggesting that the court would have to 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So what the court should 

15

say in Texas is, we have a contract which says you have 

16

to go to Virginia, but because of 1390(a) we forget 

17

about the contract and we remove it here. 

18

 MR. HASTINGS: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

No 
That's what you're saying 

Texas should say. 

21

 MR. HASTINGS: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

 MR. HASTINGS: 

No, Your Honor. 
No? 
What I'm saying is the State 

24

district  if the parties were in the State district 

25

court and remove it to the Federal district court, under

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the statutes, under 1390  well, first of all, that 

2

was  that's what the removal statutes require. 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Yes. 
1390(c), which say the 

5

transfer rules still apply, the Texas district court, if 

6

we had our contract, should have said, now that you've 

7

removed this to Federal court, we must transfer this 

8

case to Virginia because the transfer rules still apply. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now, what about  suppose 

10

the plaintiff says, Please dismiss this immediately 

11

because of 1406 or  you know, because 1406 says you 

12

have to dismiss it; venue isn't proper here. 

13

 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Your Honor, under that 

14

circumstance, if it was a contract requiring a State 

15

court forum  I think that's what I understand the 

16

question to be. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

you go to Virginia. 

19

 MR. HASTINGS: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no.  The contract says 

Okay. 
They filed it in Texas 

21

State court.  You tried to remove it to Texas Federal 

22

court. 

23

 MR. HASTINGS: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

And, Your Honor 
And they say, I'm very 

sorry.  The contract that he loves says we can't remove

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

it to Texas Federal court. 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Your Honor, the contract 

3

would not prevent the removal, but once the case was 

4

removed the contract would control where the case 

5

where the case would be allocated. 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

8
9

Can I ask 
May I ask about  just go 

ahead. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

May I?  In a forum non 

10

conveniens motion, I say, oh, the witnesses are some 

11

places, what is the statutory and/or Federal Rules of 

12

Civil Procedure basis for forum non conveniens? 

13

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Justice Kennedy, that's an 

14

excellent question because the courts, when they usually 

15

rule on forum non conveniens, do not specify that. 

16

There's not a Federal 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You just cite Gulf Oil, 

and that's it? 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

In many times, yes, but a lot 

20

of times, parties do go ahead and cite 12(b)(3).  That's 

21

often done by parties in litigation. 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's if it's  if it's 

23

a State forum or foreign forum, but 1404(a) is a 

24

codification of the forum non conveniens doctrine? 

25

 MR. HASTINGS: 

For the Federal courts, yes,

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Can I ask you this about the 

3

Professor Sachs' argument?  Doesn't it lead to the 

4

consequence  doesn't it show that  wouldn't it mean 

5

that Justice Scalia's dissent was correct in Stewart and 

6

the majority was wrong in Stewart? 

7

 Because if this is  if this is 

8

contractual  suppose Ricoh, in that case, had moved 

9

had adopted  had taken the approach that Professor 

10

Sachs has recommended and moved for summary judgment ­ moved to 

11

12(b)(6) or summary judgment; that would be a contract 

12

issue.  It would be governed by Alabama law.  Alabama 

13

law says the forum selection clause is no good. 

14

 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Justice Alito, we do 

15

think there is some tension between Professor Sachs' 

16

position and the Stewart decision because, if Professor 

17

Sachs is correct and the First Circuit's correct, there 

18

really would be no room for a 1404 balancing issue.  The 

19

issue, I believe, that you are asking about 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But why is that?  Why 

wouldn't 1404(a) continue to apply? 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

Justice Scalia, if the 

23

contract  if the contract elevated this to an issue on 

24

the merits, is essentially what 12(b)(6) does, then it 

25

becomes an issue not just about venue; it becomes an

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

issue about merits.  And so a venue allocation provision 

2

wouldn't change the fact that if the case was in the 

3

wrong forum 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If  but it depends 

5

upon  upon the defendant.  If he chooses to go the 

6

1404(a) route, he could go that way, couldn't he? 

7

 MR. HASTINGS: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

under 12(b)(6), would he? 

10

 MR. HASTINGS: 

11

under 12(b)(6), but 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13
14

Well, Your Honor 
He wouldn't have to move 

He wouldn't have to move 

So it  so it wouldn't 

necessarily overrule Stewart. 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

But there's a potential 

15

problem here, and this is one of the practical issues 

16

with Professor Sachs' issue  approach.  If it's an 

17

issue on the merits, it doesn't have to be raised right 

18

at the beginning of the case. 

19

 A party could certainly move to transfer and 

20

do a lot of other things, but they could raise that 

21

issue as a defense on the merits of the lawsuit and have 

22

it resolved at trial after the entire proceeding had 

23

proceeded in a forum other than where the contract was 

24

required. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I don't follow that.  If

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's an affirmative defense, you have to raise it or you 

2

lose it.  You can't hold back an affirmative defense, 

3

and, in the middle of the trial, say, Oh, there's an 

4

affirmative defense here.  (8)(c) requires you to 

5

state it. 

6

 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Justice Ginsburg, it 

7

would certainly have to be pleaded.  And certainly, 

8

there is opportunity  you know, leave is freely 

9

granted in cases unless  you know, other circumstances 

10

arise.  It's possible to plead it down the line.  But 

11

most importantly, it's when do you get a ruling on that 

12

issue?  And that's the problem. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, what is the problem 

14

with this?  You admit that if he goes to Virginia 

15

well, he files his suit in Virginia.  All right.  Then 

16

he says, judge, everything's in Texas, please remove 

17

under 1404(a)  you know, go  send it down to Texas. 

18

And you agree that  that in an unusual case, you say, 

19

because you give a lot of weight to the contract, he 

20

could win and go to Texas, right? 

21

 MR. HASTINGS: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's our position, yes. 
That's your position, fine. 

23

If that's your position, what conceivable difference 

24

does it make if he goes to Texas in the first place, and 

25

then you say, remove it to Virginia?  I mean, it should

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

work out the same way.  It should work out that the 

2

balancing under 1404  you know, it gives you the 

3

the factors should be the same, shouldn't they? 

4

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Your Honor, the way this 

5

would work out is if  focusing on the 1404(a) issue, 

6

the real issue gets down to where does the lawsuit need 

7

to be filed, what rules are going to be in place, and if 

8

a party can just file in Texas because they want  they 

9

want to try to move it there for convenience, they can 

10

just file in Texas, what they're doing is they're 

11

requiring a party who just wants to live 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's a terrible thing.  You 

13

have to say 1404(a), and the other case he has to say 

14

1404(a) and it  I mean, maybe it makes some tremendous 

15

practical difference. 

16

 But if it makes not much difference, I have 

17

three routes that seem to me all should work out the 

18

same way, and in favor of their route is the absolute 

19

language that Justice Kagan pointed out before, plus the 

20

footnote.  Okay? 

21

 So I'm thinking, hey, this doesn't make 

22

it's important to have a rule.  It's important to have 

23

one clear approach.  But as between the three, it 

24

shouldn't matter, and they should all reach the same 

25

conclusions.  So let's go with the language of Stewart.

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

All right.  What about  now, what's the answer to 

2

that? 

3

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Justice Breyer, first of all, 

4

I would agree with you that under this case, all three 

5

routes should have lead  led to the exact same 

6

conclusion.  That's  that is correct under this case, 

7

but that may not be in all cases.  Why it matters is 

8

that parties should be forced to honor their contracts. 

9

 And so if a party honors its contract and 

10

there's a very high standard, such as the exceptional 

11

circumstances standard for receiving a transfer, 

12

their  parties who are following their contract, it's 

13

unlikely you're going to have much litigation over 

14

transfers. 

15

 Whereas if a party can say I can try my shot 

16

at a home court forum, file in violation of the contract 

17

and then make the other party raise this issue and have 

18

to litigate venue, we're going to have a tremendous 

19

litigation about venue.  That's the problem. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The law travels with 

21

the law of the transferring State travels to the 

22

transferred State.  So they've undone  they're taking 

23

Texas law, if you go under 1404, to Virginia. 

24
25

 MR. HASTINGS: 

And that would be a problem 

in many cases, Your Honor.

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And that would defeat 

2

the purpose of the venue selection to start with. 

3

That's part of your argument? 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That would be taken care 

5

of simply by saying Van Dusen v. Barrack does not apply 

6

when a party is acting in violation of a contractual 

7

provision.  Van Dusen against Barrack was intended to 

8

give the plaintiff plaintiff's choice of initial forum. 

9

If plaintiff chooses a forum in violation of the 

10
11

contract, there's no reason why Van Dusen should apply. 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Justice Ginsburg, 

12

that  that points out that if the Court were to not 

13

just strictly enforce the contracts, it raises many new 

14

issues that this Court has not yet had to address. 

15

 I'd like to reserve my time.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. ALLENSWORTH 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court: 
 We brought this $160,000 construction case 

23

in the Western District of Texas, which is where we 

24

performed our work, where the project's located, where 

25

all the witnesses reside, and where virtually all of the

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

evidence is located. 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Allensworth, where 

3

you agreed not to bring it. 

4

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
So I'm going back to what 

6

Justice Breyer says.  Let's suppose you're right about 

7

1404, and I think you have some pretty good arguments. 

8

1404, it seems to me, shouldn't affect this case in the 

9

sense that you should have  this was a negotiated 

10
11

contract. 
 You got something for the fact that you 

12

accepted inconvenience when you brought a suit.  And 

13

under 1404, the court is perfectly entitled  the court 

14

has to take that into account, that this was a 

15

negotiated contract, that you accepted in convenience, 

16

and that you got something for your  for your 

17

acceptance of inconvenience.  The end.  You have to live 

18

with your contract. 

19

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

No, Your Honor.  We have a 

20

contract, and we are having to live with it in the sense 

21

that we're up here now 15 months after the district 

22

court ruled that we were supposed to  we should 

23

15 months after the district court denied the motion to 

24

transfer. 

25

 What we  and we did  and those are

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

indeed the terms of our contract.  However, the  we 

2

felt that any court following Stewart, and 1404 would 

3

weigh the interests of justice in the decision whether 

4

to grant the transfer or not, and indeed, that's exactly 

5

what the district court found. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, the interests  the 

7

interests of justice that the district court weighed 

8

almost all boiled down to the interests of your client, 

9

the inconvenience of witnesses.  Well, Atlantic Marine, 

10

to the extent we're talking about their witnesses, 

11

they're not concerned about the inconvenience of having 

12

their witnesses go to  to Norfolk, but your 

13

witnesses  the other witnesses are your witnesses.  So 

14

that's a factor that goes to your convenience. 

15

Compulsory process to produce witnesses, same thing. 

16

 So what were the public interests that 

17

what were the interests that were weighed here that are 

18

not the interests of JCrew? 

19

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

If I might, Your Honor, 

20

first off, the district court didn't give any shrift to 

21

our witness.  He was concerned with the nonparty 

22

witnesses who were not a party to this 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if they're not your 

24

witnesses, then they're  they're Atlantic Marine's 

25

witnesses.  So why should that be  why should the

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inconvenience of Atlantic Marine's witnesses be a factor 

2

that weighs against Atlantic Marine's position that the 

3

case should be tried in Norfolk? 

4

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

They were neither Atlantic 

5

Marine's witnesses, nor our witnesses.  They were 

6

nonparty witnesses, and the issue that Judge 

7

Higginbotham addressed in the Fifth Circuit 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Are they just going to walk in the courtroom and say, 
I'd  I'd like to testify? 

11

 (Laughter.) 

12

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

Exactly. 
Surely, they're one side's 

or the other's, aren't they? 

15

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17

Just volunteer witnesses? 

Your Honor 
What kind of  what kind 

of proceedings do they have in there? 

18

 (Laughter.) 

19

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Your Honor, our point is 

20

that, if it's in Texas, they can get in their pickup and 

21

drive to the courthouse and testify.  And if this case 

22

is moved to Virginia, those witnesses essentially are 

23

unavailable to us. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Who  who is going to call 

these witnesses, you or Atlantic Marine?

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

We'd be the ones calling 

them. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You do, so they're your 

4

witnesses.  The fact that they don't work for you is 

5

is immaterial here.  So let's say they're out of the 

6

picture.  Now, what else  what's left?  What other 

7

public interests are involved? 

8
9
10
11

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

The law of Texas, which we 

think applies to this case, with which the district 
court 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is  Texas contract law is 

12

so arcane that the judges in the Eastern District of 

13

Virginia can't figure it out?  Is that right? 

14
15

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

I wouldn't suggest that, 

Your Honor. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh, okay. 

All right.  So why  why 

19

then couldn't you go to Virginia with all these factors? 

20

I mean, maybe the jury has to take 42 visits to the 

21

bottom of an oil well shaft.  I don't know.  I mean, 

22

there could be something that would weigh in your favor. 

23

I don't know the case.  So why not go to Virginia and 

24

then file a 1404 motion? 

25

 And it should reach the same result, whether

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you  you go to Texas and ask to stay there or whether 

2

you go to Virginia under 1404(a)  you win this case, 

3

let's say  or whether you go to Virginia.  It should 

4

get to the same place, shouldn't it? 

5

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Your Honor, in some ways, 

6

that's exactly what we're worried about.  The same place 

7

is 15 months after the court's ruled on the transfer 

8

motion. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So it's actually your 

10

expense because you would have to go to Virginia and you 

11

would have to file the motion.  Maybe you can do it by 

12

mail or you'd have to  but I don't know. 

13

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

We filed a motion.  If we 

14

filed  if we filed this lawsuit in Virginia and filed 

15

it simultaneously with a 1404 motion 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Yes. 
 by their lights 
Yes. 
 the court, as I think 

20

one of the Justices pointed out, couldn't transfer it 

21

back to Texas anyway because, by their lights, venue is 

22

improper anywhere except Virginia. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no.  They are not 

24

saying  they said that you could make the 1404 motion 

25

in Virginia, and they think it would only be granted in

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an exceptional case, but that's their opinion in that, 

2

and so it should come to the same conclusion.  They 

3

aren't barring you from that on their view. 

4

 But my thought is that, if all these come to 

5

the same result in the end and you just need one ruling, 

6

we have something pointing on their side  your side, 

7

which is the Stewart footnote and the language of the 

8

you know, the absolute language of the venue statutes, 

9

and you have something pointing in their side, which is, 

10

if we count by numbers, five circuits are in their favor 

11

and only three in yours. 

12

 All right. 

13

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Help me. 
If there wasn't  if 

14

there hadn't been a forum selection clause in the 

15

contract and we'd filed suit in Texas, it's 

16

inconceivable that they could  they could have 

17

successfully moved the case to Virginia.  The only thing 

18

going in favor of this case going to Virginia is that 

19

forum selection clause. 

20
21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

a big thing, isn't it?  I mean, that's what the whole 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

Well, that's kind of 

It's a significant factor. 
It's a significant 

factor.  And  and the problem, the difference, all

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

things don't lead to the same place.  1404 says to the 

2

district court, look at a hodgepodge of things, 

3

including the interest of justice, and  and figure it 

4

out and  you know, maybe they will give the contract 

5

some weight or maybe they won't, and if they do, it's 

6

not clear how you weigh the contract against the 

7

interest of justice.  It gives a broad discretion.  It 

8

says they may transfer. 

9

 1406 is an entirely different animal. 

It 

10

says you shall dismiss or  or transfer.  It's sort of 

11

a  you know, you have the safety valve to transfer, 

12

and I don't know why you  you so cavalierly dismiss, 

13

oh, it's in the contract, of course, but we've got more 

14

witnesses. 

15

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

It is in the  Your 

16

Honor, it is in the contract.  Because it's in the 

17

contract, we didn't get the deference that otherwise 

18

plaintiff would get on selection of venue.  We had 

19
20
21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that couldn't 

have come as a surprise. 
 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

No, sir.  And we 

22

haven't  we haven't attacked the clause on Bremen 

23

standards.  We haven't claimed it was induced by fraud 

24

or that it was overreaching.  We accept that.  The 

25

question that we've got is whether the  whether the

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Federal judiciary has to accept that contract clause as 

2

guiding their decision 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, it does in this way. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if 1404  if the 

5
6

court 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It does in this way.  1404, 

7

as Justice Ginsburg said, is a codification of forum non 

8

conveniens law, which is a balancing of private and 

9

public interests.  It seems to me what Justice Alito 

10

said was absolutely right.  You have given up the 

11

ability to claim private interests here by virtue of 

12

your choice to sign that contract. 

13

 The only thing that could weigh in the 

14

balance against that is if there is some  something 

15

that has nothing to do with your convenience, but is 

16

instead a feature of  of  something about why it's 

17

important to the judicial system, to the public 

18

interest, about keeping the trial in one place. 

19

 And as Justice Alito suggested, you have not 

20

been able to point to anything, nor would there be 

21

anything to point to, in most cases involving forum 

22

selection clauses. 

23

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

In most cases, there 

24

wouldn't be, and that's why in most cases the clauses 

25

are enforced, and that's why I don't think you have seen

34

Alderson Reporting Company

one of these for 25 years. 
 The reason that we've got  that we think 

3

our case is somewhat unique is that it involves a 

4

construction project in the district in which we filed 

5

suit.  All of the witnesses are there.  Virtually all of 

6

the physical evidence is there.  It's subject, if we 

7

stay in Texas, to Texas law. 

8

 And for those reasons, if the case is going 

9

to get sent to Virginia, the systemic integrity of the 

10

system, I think, is put in play. 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, but the reason 

12

for these clauses  the enforceability of these clauses 

13

is critically important to a lot of modern commerce. 

14

 If you  I don't know what the details are 

15

here, but a lot of times your company  and they are 

16

doing business now all across the country, and you say, 

17

I don't want to do business all across the country if 

18

I'm going to get dragged into different courts, who 

19

knows where, with different  where the juries are 

20

different, I want to do business around the country, so 

21

long as, if I am going to be sued, it's right here.  So 

22

I'm only going to do business with people who are 

23

willing to say, if I have a problem, I will sue you 

24

right here. 

25

 That's  that's critically important to

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

modern  modern commerce.  And the idea, well, you're 

2

going to let a court say, well, but there are a few more 

3

witnesses here  you know, it's convenient to them and 

4

all that, that  that seems to be throwing a 

5

significant wrench into the process. 

6

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Your Honor, I  I don't 

7

view it as a wrench, as opposed to an opportunity or 

8

mandate from Congress to the  to the Federal courts to 

9

exercise some discretion in deciding whether to enforce 

10
11

these clauses or not.  Stewart v. Ricoh 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But your  your 

12

adversary is not taking that discretion away.  It's 

13

saying  your adversary, I understand, is conceding 

14

that Virginia has the ability to apply 1404 in it's 

15

judgment, but you should honor the contract. 

16

 I have one fundamental problem, which is 

17

slightly different.  Under Bremen and Carnival, if the 

18

forum selected was arbitration or a State court, then 

19

the court has no 1404 power.  It must transfer to those 

20

venues. 

21

 If we accept 1404 as applying, then we're 

22

disfavoring commercial parties from picking Federal 

23

courts because they're going to have to accept that a 

24

nonselected venue will have the power to make the 

25

decision whether to transfer or not.

36

 That seems to me to invite  there may be 


2


people who think that's a good thing, get cases out of 


3


the Federal court, even if they are international 


4


commercial cases.  But isn't that what you are inviting? 


5


 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Your Honor, I would say 


6

that's a possibility.  I would say that, on the other 


7

hand, that the arbitration example that you brought up, 


8

that is governed by a separate statute anyway.  So 


9

the  the Federal Arbitration Act is going to govern 


10

whether that 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

13
14

Well 
 whether the arbitration 

clause ought to be enforced or not. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The  the clause here 

15

allowed suit in  in State or Federal court.  Suppose 

16

the clause  the forum selection clause had just said "all 

17

disputes shall be litigated in the Circuit Court for the 

18

City of Norfolk."  It doesn't say anything about the 

19

Eastern District of Virginia. 
 What would be the result 

20

then?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And the same thing if 

3

if the choice was of an arbitral forum, then you 

4

recognize in those two cases the result would have to be 

5

dismissal? 

6

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
And what would be the 

8

authority for dismissing the case if it had specified 

9

the State court? 

10

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

I think it would be the 

11

same one as in Bremen, which didn't  in The Bremen, 

12

which didn't mention court 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No.  Bremen is an admiralty 

case.  Why won't it just be a forum non conveniens? 
 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

It  it would be, and 

16

I've forgotten which Justice raised the question about 

17

this.  1404(a) is a codification of forum non 

18

conveniens.  In the absence of that, the case would just 

19

be dismissed. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  I mean, 1404, it 

21

says that if it's says  if the contract clause 

22

specifies a Federal court, it's a 1404 motion.  If it 

23

specifies a State court, it's a forum non conveniens 

24

motion.

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm sorry? 
The  if, in fact, you 

6

specify a State court, if, in fact, you specify a 

7

foreign court, if, in fact, you specify arbitration, you 

8

agree, in those instances, you are going to use forum 

9

non conveniens or you are going to use 1406.  But you 

10

are saying where you specify a court in a different 

11

State, namely a Federal court in a different State, 

12

there you use 1404.

have it the same  you know  okay.  I see the answer.

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Justice Breyer 
Forget it. 
No, but that raises a 

19

larger question, and if I could  if I could address for 

20

just a second  and that's the systemic integrity of 

21

the  of the system. 

22

 If you are going to transfer a case to 

23

within the system to another Federal court that's going 

24

to have to hear the case, one like this one where he is 

25

likely going to have to hear it without witnesses or

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

certainly without live witnesses, and to render a 

2

judgment based on facts that were developed 1,500 miles 

3

away on a project that is that far away, that does 

4

implicate, I think, the integrity of the system and 

5

that, ultimately, a Federal judge is the one that's 

6

going to have to write and take it up in judgment, if I 

7

can't scare up the witnesses to be in Virginia. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Don't  don't put me in 

the group that thinks you can use forum non conveniens. 

10

When  when you have a forum selection clause for a 

11

State court and suit is brought  attempted to be 

12

brought in a Federal court  I mean, if it's in the 

13

Federal court, that is the most convenient court  I 

14

mean, let's say it's in  in a different State where 

15

all the witnesses are. 

16

 I think it's very strange to say that, 

17

because there is a contract provision requiring it to be 

18

brought in a State court, this court is an inconvenient 

19

court.  I  do you know that the doctrine of forum non 

20

conveniens has ever been used that way. 

21

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

No, sir.  No, Your Honor, 

22

I don't.  I don't.  And to confess I haven't thought 

23

through the  the question that you just said. 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Do you know the answer 

this is another  I keep thinking they should all come

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to the same conclusion.  But, then, what about this 

2

point Justice Sotomayor raised?  Suppose you sue in 

3

Texas  you know, you get there, but the contract, 

4

let's say, was a different contract from yours, but it 

5

just was made in Nevada.  Everything about this concerns 

6

Nevada.  Are they really going to use Texas law to 

7

interpret the contract rather than Nevada's? 

8
9

 I would have thought that the choice of law 
question is a different question, and where you sue 

10

should be irrelevant to the choice of law question 

11

except insofar  I don't know.  Maybe you looked 

12
13
14

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Van Dusen said that the 

law moves with the  with the 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Only because the 

15

plaintiff  the plaintiff's choice of forum was to be 

16

respected.  But if the plaintiff chooses a forum in 

17

violation of the contract, the whole rationale of that 

18

case falls. 

19

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Your Honor 
It was to honor the 

21

plaintiff's choice of forum.  Well, the contract says 

22

the plaintiff doesn't have a choice. 

23

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Your Honor, the contract 

24

as Judge Higginbotham pointed out doesn't have a 

25

selection of law  law clause.  They put  it's got

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

every other dispute resolution clause that could be in 

2

there to make it difficult for us to get this case to a 

3

court, but it doesn't have a  it doesn't have a choice 

4

of law provision in it. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the only reason that 

6

Van Dusen came out the way it did was  I think it was 

7

that Justice Black said the plaintiff's choice of forum 

8

merits respect.  It doesn't merit respect when the 

9

plaintiff has agreed that the suit will go forward 

10

someplace else. 

11

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13
14

I don't recall.  Sorry. 
In other words, that 

issue has not been decided by them. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If 1404 is the correct 

15

procedural route, why shouldn't the rule be something 

16

like this, where there is a forum selection clause, the 

17

burden is on  the burden of trying to establish venue 

18

in some other jurisdiction is on the party opposing the 

19

forum selection clause, not the party that's invoking 

20

the forum selection clause. 

21

 And the only factors that can be considered 

22

against the forum selection clause to  to result in an 

23

exceptional case where that wouldn't be honored are 

24

factors that have nothing to do with the convenience of 

25

the  of the party that doesn't want it tried in  in

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the selected forum or with the likelihood of success of 

2

the party that doesn't want it tried in the  in 

3

the jurisdiction specified in the forum selection 

4

clause. 

5

 So in your case, if there had been a 

6

hurricane that wiped out the courts of the Eastern 

7

District of Virginia for some period of time so no cases 

8

could be tried, or there was an incredible backload of 

9

cases there that would prevent the case from being 

10

tried, maybe that would be  those would be something 

11

that might amount to an exceptional circumstance, but 

12

everything else is off the board. 

13

 What's wrong with that? 

14

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

First off, on the validity 

15

of the clause, we acknowledge we'd have the burden. If we 

16

were trying to avoid this clause on the ground, on 

17

whatever grounds, or under any Bremen grounds or we'd gotten 

18

cheated into it or anything like that.  We'd have the 

19

burden on that.  We didn't try to carry that burden. 

20

We're not attacking the clause.  They have the burden on 

21

the main case  on the transfer itself. 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, why should that  why 

should that be, where there's a forum selection clause? 
 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

I don't think that it's 

even a matter, really, so much of burden as it is of

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

weight, and you all have already spoken on that where 

2

you said that it's  that clause is to get 

3

significant  significant weight.  It ought to be 

4

central to the analysis, but it's not dispositive. 

5

 And our  our contention was that the 

6

clause was not dispositive, but that every  every 

7

factor that possibly could go  militate against 

8

transferring this case to Virginia existed, and that's 

9

why the court, giving appropriate deference to the 

10

clause, to that clause, hearing what the evidence was 

11

and deciding as you 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It should have been a 

13

Virginia court to make that decision, instead of your 

14

friendly, down home Texas court.  And that's  you 

15

know, that was why the forum selection clause was put in 

16

there.  It doesn't seem to me such a stretch as you 

17

think it is to say that the venue is improper when you 

18

have agreed that venue would not lie in this court. 

19

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

We can't confer venue.  We 

20

can  we can waive venue, but we can't make improper 

21

venue 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So the  the question is: 

23

Is it improper when it's been waived?  Is it improper 

24

for a court to acknowledge venue when the party has 

25

has said I  I cannot  I cannot bring my suit in this

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court.  I don't think it's a terrible stretch to  to 

2

call that improper venue. 

3

 However theoretical it may be, venue is 

4

is decided by  by statute, of course it is.  But 

5

people may waive it, and when people have waived it, I 

6

don't know that there's a great interest in  in saying 

7

that, nonetheless, the venue remains proper. 

8
9

 It seems to me you've given it away, and it 
ought to be  it ought to be the  the court where the 

10

parties agree that suit would lie that would decide 

11

these  these changeofvenue questions. 

12

 The provision need not be absolutely 

13

dispositive, but to the extent it isn't, that is a call 

14

that  that ought to be made by the jurisdiction that 

15

the parties agreed to.  The whole litigation ought to 

16

begin there.  They shouldn't have to litigate this 

17

change of venue provision in a court where the parties 

18

agreed they would not appear. 

19

 It seems to me terribly unfair. 

20

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

There's a couple of 

21

factors on that, Your Honor.  First off, the rule that I 

22

think my colleagues here are calling for effectively 

23

emasculates 1404 and takes the Federal judiciary out of 

24

it.  The question  and I follow your question about 

25

the propriety of the venue.

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why is that?  Why is that? 

2

Why can't the Court, where you agreed to be sued, apply 

3

1404? 

4

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Another reason for that is 

5

that our contract has a oneway arbitration clause in it 

6

which they  which the Petitioner claims not to have 

7

waived.  If this case is decided  it goes to 

8

Virginia  if we filed the case in Virginia and they 

9

immediately demanded arbitration, the case would be 

10

arbitrated. 

11

 But under the FAA, it would be sent to an 

12

it'd be  the court in Virginia would appoint an 

13

arbitrator in  presumably, in Virginia.  And under the 

14

FAA, we don't even necessarily even have the right to 

15

take depositions to provide  to move to get the 

16

evidence before the court even in deposition form. 

17
18
19

 We'd rather have the case decided in Texas 
on $160,000 case, and I know that's a pittance. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Excuse me.  Are you 

20

saying that, by filing in Texas, you're not going to 

21

arbitration? 

22

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

No.  If we go to 

23

arbitration, we go to arbitration in Texas.  We don't 

24

have any complaint about that.  What we don't want to do 

25

is to go to arbitration in Virginia, which it has

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not had  and in this contract, for everything it's got 

2

in it, it doesn't have a clause that says that 

3

arbitration would be conducted in  there's not a 

4

choice of forum clause for the arbitration.  There is 

5

for litigation, but not for arbitration. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what's more favorable 

7

about Texas other than your convenience?  What's more 

8

favorable about arbitration in Texas other than your 

9

convenience? 

10

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

11

12
13

That's my 
That's the only thing. 

It's convenient for you to be in Texas. 
 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

It's convenient for us. 

14

The arbitrator can drive out to the project and draw his 

15

own conclusions about what  about how the thing is 

16

built.  He can talk to the witnesses who are within his 

17

subpoena power or the subpoena power of our District 

18

Court in Texas to show up.  Yes, sir. 

19

I'd just like, if you'd want, to 

21

give you a chance to take what I've  I think Professor 

22

Sachs says, look, there is a way which you can both 

23

follow the statutes literally and say, well, venue is 

24

here, and also get the place to the right forum 

25

respecting the contract.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Just say it is an affirmative defense, which 

2

Justice Ginsburg says the First Circuits follow this 

3

approach.  You put it in the complaint.  The answer, and 

4

once it's in the answer, the judge can put it front and 

5

center.  Indeed, in case he forgets to do that, the 

6

defendant will remind him and say, you've got to get it 

7

to the right court, and let's decide this affirmative 

8

defense thing first. 

9
10
11

 And  and now, we're back in the same 
place.  What do you think of that? 
 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

I think that that's going 

12

to unnecessarily complicate this.  It gets in  it 

13

raises some difficult to hearing questions about 

14

which  difficult hearing questions which the Court, I 

15

think, successfully avoided in  with its decision in 

16

Stewart. 

17

 I don't think that  that 12(b) motions are 

18

particularly appropriate places to decide these contract 

19

issues.  And it eliminates the 1404 gatekeeper role that 

20

the district court otherwise could be providing and was 

21

providing. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Professor Sachs says that, 

23

in the case of any disputed facts on a 12(b)(6), you 

24

would have to have a trial.  Do you agree with that? 

25

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

Yes, Your Honor, and I

49

Alderson Reporting Company

1

think that he under  underestimates the ability for 

2

resolute counsel to raise disputed facts that would 

3

otherwise prevent the summary judgment practice that he 

4

suggested 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what facts 

6

are  what facts are  in the normal case, what facts 

7

are going to be pertinent?  I mean, you've got the 

8

contract there.  I mean, I suppose you can always say, 

9

we entered under duress and all that, but that wouldn't 

10

seem to me to be typical in the normal commercial case 

11

in which these provisions are critically important. 

12

 What facts are going to be there? 

13

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

14
15
16
17

I think there might be a 

question of materiality.  There might be a question 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But what type 

what type of materiality? 
 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

How material that clause 

18

was to the parties' contract or whether you were going 

19

to try to have separability  and focus exclusively on 

20

that clause. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, the venue 

22

provision  I mean, if they go to the trouble of 

23

putting a venue selection  forum selection provision 

24

in, I would say it seems pretty material.

handwritten clause in this entire contract, which is in 

9

the appendix, I think, at Page 16, is the one that says 

10

what the price is. 

11

 What brings us here to the Federal system is 

12

not for a declaratory relief or to make new law on 

13

venue; it's to collect $160,000.  That clause, I think, 

14

ultimately would be weighed  might be weighed depending 

15

on the Court, if it  if the case was being decided on 

16

purely contract grounds

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So they would be  the 

18

only people collecting that $160,000 are going to be the 

19

lawyers. 

20

 (Laughter.) 

21

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I wish. 

You took a contingency 

24

case in a contract matter? 

25

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

And the other thing, as

51

Professor Sachs points out 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 (Laughter.) 

4

 MR. ALLENSWORTH: 

I wish. 

The  as he points out, 

5

and Justice Haynes  Judge Haynes did in the Fifth 

6

Circuit, whether they can file suit for us for breach of 

7

contract and the expense that we've put them to.  Yes, I 

8

think  I think they probably could.  We at least get 

9

$160,000 head start on that, and they can bring that as 

10

an offset to our claim if they want to. 

11

 We disagree with the question of whether it 

12

would cost them any more to litigate in Texas than it 

13

would in Virginia anyway.  They're going to have to hire 

14

a law firm.  If we litigate in Virginia, they are going 

15

to have to send a lot of  batch of lawyers back to 

16

Texas to defend the depositions that we'd ask to be 

17

taken there. 

18

 I don't know that this case costs any more 

19

to be litigated in Texas where the witnesses are 

20

available and where they might not have to be deposed 

21

than in Virginia where they have to  where they have 

22

to ship them across the country.

 Mr. Hastings, you have four minutes left. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. HASTINGS 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. HASTINGS: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

I have just a few brief comments. 
 First, the parties bargained for the right 

7

result, and they bargained and reached a contract that 

8

should settle the issue of convenience and where this 

9

case should be litigated.  Stewart has an important 

10

observation that I think needs to be emphasized.  Even 

11

under a 1404(a) analysis, the majority in Stewart said 

12

The Bremen is still instructive.  And if it's 

13

instructive on anything, on any rules enforcing a 

14

contract, it should be instructive at this level. 

15

 The burden should be on the party trying to 

16

get out from their contract.  The Fifth Circuit 

17

misallocated the burden.  The burden should also be a 

18

high one.  It really should require exceptional 

19

circumstances or perhaps even more, and it should not be 

20

a case where a party can avoid its contract based upon 

21

inconveniences that were foreseeable at the time of 

22

contracting. 

23

 For example, the fact that JCrew hired 

24

Texans to work on its project, it knew what the project 

25

was about and what it would need to do, and it should

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not be able to rely upon hiring Texans to change the 

2

deal it negotiated with my client. 

3

 There needs to be a clear rule that allows 

4

the courts to hopefully answer the questions about 

5

contracts and venue, so we all can stop litigating these 

6

issues and know the right answers and avoid inundating 

7

the courts with motions to transfer for parties wanting 

8

to renegotiate contracts. 

9

 Since the Third Circuit and Sixth Circuit 

10

and, now, the Fifth Circuit have adopted the minority 

11

position, there has been a proliferation of litigation 

12

when a contract already answered the question.  We cited 

13

many cases in our cert petition in a footnote, and I 

14

know there's been many more since then.  And those are 

15

the ones that you can find published.  That doesn't even 

16

mention the ones that are unpublished.  And so a clear 

17

rule needs to be in place to avoid these problems. 

18

 Justice Kagan, you raised the issue of forum 

19

non conveniens as perhaps the answer as to what would 

20

happen for a State or foreign contract clause.  I wanted 

21

to briefly touch on that because I don't believe that's 

22

the right answer. 

23

 The Bremen looked at a case that came up as 

24

a forum non conveniens case and said, we are not going 

25

to use the forum non conveniens test for enforcing a

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contract requiring litigation in an international forum. 

2

They resoundingly rejected the forum non conveniens 

3

approach, and I believe the circuit courts have read 

4

Bremen as rejecting that approach. 

5

 If that were going to be the approach to 

6

answer the problem created by the Fifth Circuit for 

7

foreign and State courts, what we would end up with is a 

8

new common law approach, whether called forum non 

9

conveniens or called something else, that looks like 

10

nothing like forum non conveniens and probably a whole 

11

new line of litigation over how that's 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I think you mistook my point 

13

at least.  Maybe I didn't express it clearly.  Bremen 

14

comes up on a forum non conveniens motion, and the Court 

15

says, yes, the contract controls, quite properly so. 

16

 So  you know, the fact that it comes up on 

17

a forum non conveniens motion has nothing to do with the 

18

question of whether the contract controls where, people have 

19

negotiated for a certain set of things and there is no 

20

exceptional public interest otherwise. 

21

 MR. HASTINGS: 

And, Justice Kagan, following 

22

Bremen, the lower courts have recognized that what 

23

essentially Bremen is doing is saying forum non 

24

conveniens is not the right approach, and so instead of 

25

a common law vehicle to answer this issue, we submit

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the right answer is right there in the rules 

2

already. 

3

 It's 12(b)(3) is the best answer. 

Section 

4

1406 allows the Court also to address this issue. 

5

Honestly, Section  Rule 12(b)(6) in Professor Sachs' 

6

approach is much better than leaving these issues to 

7

balancing tests. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

question about 12(b)(6)? 

10

 MR. HASTINGS: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I ask you one last 

Yes, Your Honor. 
Which is  you know, when 

12

1404 is  suppose a State which does not recognize 

13

these clauses, 1404 trumps that according to Stewart. 

14

But if you were under 12(b)(6), you would have to go to 

15

what Justice Scalia does in the Stewart dissent.  I 

16

think you would have to go to a twin aims of Erie 

17

analysis. 

18

 And in that circumstance, it seems to me 

19

that the State law would come out the victor; isn't that 

20

right? 

21

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Justice Kagan, the only way I 

22

know how to answer that question is I do not know how 

23

the Professor Sachs approach can actually be reconciled 

24

with Stewart.  There is significant tensions in how that 

25

plays out as an issue that I do not know how it plays

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

out, but I suspect it would result in lots of 

2

litigation 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If it's under 12(b)(3), 

4

then Stewart stays, and it's Federal law that controls 

5

and the judge decides, right? 

6

 MR. HASTINGS: 

Yes, Your Honor, and that's 

7

why we are asking this Court to follow the majority 

8

approach on this issue.
