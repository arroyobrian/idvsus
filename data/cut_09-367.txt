CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 09-367, Dolan v.

5

United States.

6

Ms. Karlan.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. KARLAN:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act makes

12

restitution a mandatory part of a defendant's sentence

13

for certain crimes, and it sets out two paths by which a

14

district court can meet its responsibilities.
First, section 3663A(a)(1) authorizes

15
16

district courts to impose restitution when sentencing a

17

defendant; that is, at the same time that they impose

18

terms of imprisonment, fines, probation, or the like.

19

Second, section 3664(d)(5) of the Act allows final

20

determination of the amount of restitution to occur

21

during a period not to exceed 90 days.
Once those periods and the general deadlines

22
23

for correcting or appealing a sentence have passed, a

24

court's judgment is final, even if it fails to order

25

restitution.

In this, the Mandatory Victim Restitution

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Act is like all other mandatory sentencing provisions,

2

and as this Court confirmed 2 years ago in Greenlaw v.

3

United States, when a court fails to impose a mandatory

4

sentence, that error can be corrected only by following

5

what this Court called the dispositive direction

6

regarding sentencing errors.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

Is your

8

argument that if the district court -- for whatever

9

reason, unlikely as it may be -- starts a hearing the

10

day after the rest of the sentence was imposed and has

11

to continue that hearing for 91 days before it can

12

render a judgment --

13

MS. KARLAN:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16

No.
-- that it's now barred

from entering that judgment?
MS. KARLAN:

No.

If I understand your

17

question correctly, the district court has imposed

18

sentence on day one announcing imprisonment.

19

during the next 90 days, it has a power to set a date

20

and make final determination of the restitution amount.

21

Once that 90-day period has run -- in this case, on

22

October 28th, because the sentencing occurred on

23

July 30th -- the district court loses the authority to

24

impose restitution.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Any time

And the sentence is not

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

final until then?

2

MS. KARLAN:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's our position.
And -- and what if -- what

4

if the court does set a date for additional sentencing?

5

Then it's not final until then, right?

6

MS. KARLAN:

No, Justice Scalia.

It would

7

be that once a court has started the sentencing process,

8

it has 90 days within which to complete that process, if

9

it announces at the initial sentencing that it intends

10

to hold open the sentence for final determination of

11

restitution.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm not sure I

13

understood your response to my question.

14

that restitution order, complete all its proceedings

15

within the 90-day period?

16

MS. KARLAN:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18
19

It must impose

Yes, that's correct.
So it can't hold a

hearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day?
MS. KARLAN:

No, it cannot do that.

And if

20

it were to do that in a case where restitution were

21

mandatory, the sentence would become final, the

22

government would file an appeal, and that appeal would

23

certainly succeed, because it's plain error not to have

24

to imposed the restitution.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Your position is that if the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court puts off the order of restitution for 90 days,

2

during that period, the defendant cannot take an appeal?
MS. KARLAN:

3

If the court has announced at

4

the initial sentencing that it intends to do so, no, then

5

it cannot.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't that dramatically

7

contrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled

8

for a long time?

9

for a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal

There's a very short period of time

10

case, and you’re saying that that is dramatically

11

extended by the possibility of -- of restitution later

12

on or by the fact that the restitution order will be

13

entered later?
MS. KARLAN:

14

No, Justice Alito.

What I'm

15

saying is that a defendant can only appeal from a final

16

sentence, and until the restitutionary term is imposed

17

within the time period allowed by the MVRA, there is not

18

a final sentence.

19

restitution is --

Then he has from the time that

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

Yes, I understand that.

But

21

you’re saying the defendant is -- the defendant is

22

incarcerated, let's say; is convicted, is sentenced to

23

prison.

24

The defendant thinks he's going to win on appeal.

25

you’re saying, well, no, you have to wait 90 days

The defendant wants to take a quick appeal.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

before you can file your notice of appeal?

2

MS. KARLAN:

I believe that's correct,

3

because he has to have a final judgment before he can

4

appeal.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what -- what do you

6

do about the further provision that at any time later,

7

if the government -- or the victim finds additional

8

basis for restitution, so long as after discovering it,

9

within 60 days after that, the victim can come to the

10

court and ask for restitution?

11

Does that --

12

MS. KARLAN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What does that do?

Well -I mean, doesn't that

14

necessarily mean that there are indeed two final

15

judgments?

16

on its own, doesn't it?

17

MS. KARLAN:

That -- that one has to be -- has to go up

That's correct, but section

18

3664(o) of the statute says that the initial restitution

19

amount constitutes a final judgment, even though there

20

can be amendment after it's been entered.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MS. KARLAN:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

Where is that?

In our brief, it's on page -Oh.

Oh -- “a sentence that

imposes an order” -MS. KARLAN:

It's on page --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- “is a final judgment,

notwithstanding the fact that” --

3

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, petition appendix 60a.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MS. KARLAN:

Got you.

So that's why that has to be in

6

there, because otherwise the defendant really would be

7

in the position that Justice Alito --

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is there any circuit

9

court who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is

10

timely, in a situation in which a restitution order has

11

not been entered at the initial sentencing?
MS. KARLAN:

12

Not in precisely that way.

13

There are a couple of cases that are -- that kind of

14

circle around that.

15

So for example, Kapelushnik, which we cite

16

in our petition for certiorari and in our brief as the

17

wisest way of thinking about this, held that once the

18

90 days has lapsed, the judgment is final by operation

19

of law.

20

There’s an opinion by Judge Posner in the

21

Seventh Circuit that’s not on restitution but on a

22

related issue, which says that if you have several

23

components to the sentence, until that last component is

24

entered, the time for filing an appeal under F.R.A.P. 4

25

does not begin to run.

And that's --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In this -- when the

2

judge did not enter a date for restitution, did you

3

object to that?

4
5

MS. KARLAN:

We were not required to do so,

so we did not.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

seems that that's when the violation occurred.

statute said the court shall set a date if they’re not

9

ready to calculate the restitution, and he didn't do

It

that.
MS. KARLAN:

Well, that's correct,

12

Mr. Chief Justice, but the statute doesn't say when he

13

has to set the date.

14

has to be set so that final restitution will occur

15

during the period -- and here I quote again from the

16

statute -- "not to exceed 90 days."

17

18

The statute simply says the date

So he can set that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I thought it

says -- maybe I am misreading it.

20

this is at sentencing.

21

the previous provision -- what is it?

MS. KARLAN:

It says the court --

When sentencing -- you look at

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
you do when sentencing it.
MS. KARLAN:

3663A(a)(1) --

Right.

-- talks about what

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the statute

2

says, “the court shall set a date for the final

3

determination” … “not to exceed 90 days.”

4

MS. KARLAN:

And he didn't.

That's correct, he did not set

5

it.

But the statute -- I'm now looking at petition

6

appendix 55a, which is where section 3664(d)(5) of the

7

Act is set out.

for the final determination of the victim's losses, not

that what was --

It doesn't modify the setting of the

So within that 90-day period, I think

right.

No, I think that's

I -- I agree with you that.

16

MS. KARLAN:

Yes.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, the

18

final determination -- the date for the -- the final

19

determination can't exceed 90 days --

20
21

MS. KARLAN:

Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- but that doesn't

22

mean that the provision saying the court shall set a date

23

can wait -- that he can wait 89 days to do that.

24
25

MS. KARLAN:

No, I think it would be very

unwise for a district court to do that, but the court

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can't really set the date until it receives the

2

information that it hopes to receive from the probation

3

office or from the victim.

So that --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

No, no, no --

It can say 90 days.

It

can say 90 days.

7

MS. KARLAN:

It -- it could, yes.

Or it

8

could say, as the district court did here, I'm going to

9

hold open the date.

But it can only hold open that date

10

until the point at which it actually imposes the

11

restitution, within the 90 days.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

This is a -- this is, in

13

one respect, Ms. Karlan, a technical argument, is it

14

not?

15

probation officer's report, knew within the 90 days what

16

restitution was going to be recommended.

17

Because it's true that this defendant, from the

MS. KARLAN:

Yes.

He knew within the

18

90 days what the government's claim was going to be, but

19

the court did not hold the hearing and did not impose

20

the judgment.

21

final by operation of law on October 28th, because that

22

was 90 days after the July 30th sentencing.

23

And so the August 8th judgment became

At that point, the government could have

24

filed an appeal in this case, and, quite frankly, they

would have won.

As it was --

JUSTICE ALITO:

How is your position -- how

2

is your position consistent with the thrust of the

3

victims’ rights legislation that Congress has enacted in

4

recent years, including the statute that’s before us

5

here?

6

Now, in this case, the victim -- the

7

victim's medical bills were paid by the United States.

8

But that isn't always going to be the case, and

9

sometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost

10

income.

So you have the victim, like the victim here,

11

who is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a

12

substantial amount of future income as a result, and you

13

say that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad

14

for the victim.

15

judge waited too long.

The victim gets nothing because the

16

MS. KARLAN:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18
19

No, I don't -Do you think that’s what

Congress had in mind?
MS. KARLAN:

I don't say that, and I don't

20

think that's what Congress had in mind.

21

Congress had in mind was to strike the balance it struck

22

in this statute, which was to give victims the right to

23

receive restitution as part of a criminal sentence, as

24

long as it was done within 90 days of sentencing.

25

First, what

Second, the government can appeal if a court

doesn't follow the rules.

2

Third --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't

4

the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that

5

up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not

6

sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests

of victims?

thing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure

9

they knew about court proceedings, and so forth.

10

They were doing their own prosecutorial

And you’re saying, well, if the court makes

11

a mistake and the prosecution falls down in its

12

responsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who

13

gets victimized again.
MS. KARLAN:

14

No, that's not what I'm saying.

15

What I'm saying is Congress struck a balance.

question.

We understand that argument.

But it doesn't address the fact that the net

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, the same thing

11

would happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law

that he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he

That's correct, and Congress

here has said 90 days.

And they meant it.

If they had

19

meant to say, at any time, a victim can receive

20

restitution, they would have said that.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

But Congress says -- to

22

paraphrase and not get it accurate -- that the

23

Department of Transportation shall enact a rule

24

governing tire safety within 9 months from the

effective date of this legislation.

Well, this is a criminal

sentencing statute which is different than a civil
agency action.

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Is that law invalid?

No, generally, under this --

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is the incredibly relevant

difference, for the following reason --

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that finality in sentencing

is important, because otherwise a defendant cannot even

That's right.

This is not --

I mean

1

MS. KARLAN:

No.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. KARLAN:

That says -What?

-- that a sentence that

4

includes a term of restitution can be a final judgment,

5

even though that 60-day provision to which

6

Justice Scalia pointed is on the books.

7

But you can't have a final judgment in a

8

criminal case that involves several different components

9

of a sentence until those aspects of the sentence have

10

actually been imposed.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

MS. KARLAN:

13

Well, why isn't the --

Justice Scalia, I believe, was

referring to the 60-day provision.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, the same problem.

The 60-day provision is

16

specifically immunized from the final judgment rule by

17

section 3664(o) of the statute.

18

not.

19

I could use a slightly different example, which is:

20

Suppose a defendant is supposed to be a sentenced to a

21

fine, a mandatory fine --

22

JUTICE BREYER:

23

The 90-day provision is

So until a defendant -- perhaps I could -- perhaps

say I still need to calculate the fine -- there is no

17

He cannot appeal that sentence.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But isn't there a difference

between those two situations?

4

penalty.

5

the same of the sovereign.

6

sovereign.

A fine is a criminal

It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in
The fine goes to the

It's a traditional criminal penalty.

7

Restitution is not a traditional criminal

8

penalty.

It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a

9

civil case.

It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a

10

benefit for the victim.

It is not something that inures

11

to the benefit of the sovereign.

12

And so why doesn't it make sense to view

13

that judgment of restitution as a separate judgment,

14

just as the award of an attorney’s fees is a separate

15

final appealable order in a civil case?

16

MS. KARLAN:

17

restitution is not a civil judgment.

18

defendant's criminal punishment, and, therefore, it is

19

not like attorneys' fees, something that’s separate.

20

Well, because this judgment of
It is part of the

As we point out in our reply brief, in order

21

to calculate the amount of imprisonment, in order to

22

calculate the fine, the Federal criminal sentencing

23

provisions -- and I should note that section 3664(a)

24

appears in Title 18 in the section under miscellaneous

25

sentencing provisions, not civil provisions.

18
Alderson Reporting Company

All of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

those things interact.

And so you can't calculate one

2

of those without knowing all of them.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

But, functionally, isn't

4

it a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a

5

crime might have?

6

was to spare the victim the necessity of suing the

7

defendant and having his kind of civil restitution

8

tacked onto the criminal proceeding?

9

MS. KARLAN:

Wasn't what Congress was trying to do

That’s certainly Congress's

10

purpose, but they did it within the context of

11

sentencing.

12

really were a civil penalty, defendants would not be

13

entitled to the assistance of counsel in challenging the

14

amount of restitution, because the Sixth Amendment would

15

not apply.

The dates for filing an appeal would be

16

different.

There would be a jurisdictional bar that

17

doesn't exist in criminal cases.

18

So, for example, Justice Ginsburg, if this

This Court said several times that

19

restitution under these kinds of circumstances -- in

20

Hughey, under the predecessor to this Act, and in Kelly

21

v. Robinson -- is a penal statute.

22

her opinion for the Second Circuit in Varrone said this

23

is a penal statute.

24
25

Justice Sotomayor in

So there is no question here that this is a
substitute for a civil remedy or a supplement for a

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

civil remedy, but it is a criminal punishment.

2

Congress has said that you have to order it at

3

sentencing or within 90 days, or else it is error that

4

can be corrected through Rule 35 or by appeal, but not

5

otherwise.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Now, what -- what can the

defendant do within that 90 days?

Is there

You

And doesn't it boil down

I mean, I agree with you that if Congress

wanted to make a 90-day deadline, you really have to do

it, and you can't restitute thereafter.

That's one thing.

equally intend the judgment without the restitution

order to be a final judgment?

All right.

But if they didn't, why didn't they

MS. KARLAN:

Well --

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then later on, just as

9

in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution,

10

then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different

judgment.

12

that interpretation?

13
14

Is there -- what in the law prevents the --

MS. KARLAN:

I think two things prevent that

interpretation.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MS. KARLAN:

Yes.

One is this Court's precedent,

17

and let me talk about that.

And two is a proper reading

of section 3664(o).

19

precedent and then to 3664(o).

So I’ll turn first to the

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MS. KARLAN:

So you have precedent.

So the precedent is, for

22

example, this Court said in Parr v. United States, which

23

is cited on page 12 of the reply brief, among other

24

places, that “a judgment or decision is final for purpose

25

of appeal only when it terminates the litigation between the

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to

2

be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.”
Until restitution has been determined, a

3
4

case does not fit within Parr.

Parr is, I believe, an

5

interpretation of 1291, 28 U.S.C. 1291, which is the

6

provision that gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

So you can -- under

8

your view, you can change the amount of jail time up to

9

the point at which you have to set the restitution.

10

judge says:

11

I'm going to figure out the restitution.

I'm going to sentence you to 3 years, and

He looks, and the restitution turns out to

12
13

be a lot more than he thought.

14

only going to give you 2 years.

15

says:

So he says:

Well, I'm

Or it's less, and he

I'm going to give you 4 years.
Because the judgment is still open, he can

16
17

The

do that?
MS. KARLAN:

18

I believe, Your Honor, that he

19

can.

20

itself -- 18 U.S.C. section 3553, I believe it is --

21

talks about how a court, in sentencing a defendant, is

22

supposed to be considering all of these penalties and

23

how they interact with one another.

24
25

And the reason for that is the sentencing statute

So if a defendant can make restitution to a
victim by, for example, being put on community release

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

or probation rather than serving time in prison, a court

2

can take that into account in setting the sentence.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

3
4

MS. KARLAN:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Must take it into account --

Yes.
-- if you read 3553 the way

it's written.

strike that balance is --

10

Yes, I think they must take it

Now, whether -- how they’ll actually

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there no -- is there

11

no possibility that a judge could say:

12

this analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is,

13

I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can

14

appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence.

15

this order is final, and 3 months later, I’ll take up

16

the question of restitution when all the information is

17

in.

18

I want to make

So

The court is prevented from doing that?
MS. KARLAN:

I’m unaware of any criminal

19

rules analogue to Rule 54(b) in the civil context, because

20

in general, as I understand the way this Court's

21

precedents have worked, there have been what might look

22

like interlocutory appeals in criminal cases, but they’ve

23

always involved collateral issues.

24
25

And the problem here, for the reason that
Justice Scalia just pointed to, is restitution and the

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

amount of imprisonment are not collateral to one

2

another; that is, they may interact.

3

certainly isn't, because the statute itself says you

4

can't impose a fine to the extent that it will impair

5

restitution.

So if --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

And a fine

So the judge -- but the

7

judge could say -- once she thinks she needs -- that

8

they need time for more information:

9

defer the whole sentencing.

I'm going to

So, Defendant, you’ll have to

10

wait 3 months to find out how much time you’re going to

12

13

sentence.

That would be all right.

You could use the

Well, in effect, you’re saying the sentence

15

isn't final, so she could change it any time within the

16

90 days?

17

MS. KARLAN:

There's a slight complication

18

there, but I think the answer to your question is yes;

19

that is, the judge could delay the entire sentencing

20

under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.

21

Look, we’re not saying that you couldn't

22

get restitution in a case like this.

23

saying that you have to follow the rules.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you one

question?
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I have a question going

5

just to that.

It seems to me that if 3553, as -- as I said

6

-- maybe you shouldn't have agreed -- requires the

7

sentencing court to consider the totality of the

8

sentence it’s imposing, including the restitution,

9

that would mean that the judge cannot impose a sentence

10

before the expiration of the 90 days; that is, has to

11

wait until the restitutionary issue is resolved to

12

impose the incarceration part of the sentence.

13

MS. KARLAN:

No?

I think the way that the

14

statute is written contemplates that the judge will do

15

the regular sentencing at which he imposes these other

16

terms, but may keep it open for 90 days.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question

before you sit down?

them in the briefs and I didn't catch it -- of any cases

in which the courts -- a court of appeals has

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

To begin by addressing the question just

raised by Justice Stevens, the government agrees that we

There are, however, at least four

Under your view of

things, however, that's fortuity that the underlying

conviction was still in the appeal process, because

there is no statute of limitations under your reading.

15

A victim could come 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 100 years

16

later and say:

I'm entitled to restitution.

The statute -And absent prejudice to

bail question, where there's not issues of finality at

play, and bail is a question that repeats itself

throughout the proceedings.

Defendants are denied bail

and then make a different showing of other

resources or less danger or whatever, and they get out.

And vice versa, defendants are out and are put in.

There are no finality questions there.
What do you do in this situation when you’re

dealing with a criminal sentence where there are

And I'm going to tie that back to my starting

as not part of the final judgment in this criminal

action.

MR. HEYTENS:

apologize to the Court, it is not cited in our brief,

but it is section 18 U.S.C. section 3582(b).

Imprisonment.

4

provision says Effect of Finality of the Judgment.

5

then says, “Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence of

6

imprisonment can subsequently be” modified or altered in

7

certain ways, and then this is the critical language: "a

21

is a specific statute.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but I mean, what's

23

bothering me about this, and I'm not aware -- but you’re

24

quoting a sentence that wasn't in your brief and what I

25

hadn't taken in at all is the extent to which this is

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

inextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are

2

very important.
So unless I have in my own mind how -- how

3
4

this all fits together, I -- I don't know how to decide

5

this case.

6

going to muck up the -- the rules of appealing from a

7

criminal case.

8
9

I don't want to say something in here that’s

Now, what you’ve told me is I'm supposed to say
that within 14 days of a -- of a judgment imposing imprisonment,

10

he has to appeal, but of course if it's supervised release,

11

he doesn't, or I'm not sure.

12

MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Breyer, first and

13

foremost, the Court doesn't need to say anything about

14

any of these issues.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. HEYTENS:

Why not?

For one very simple reason:

17

The only thing that this defendant has ever attempted to

18

appeal at any point is the order of restitution.

19

never attempted to appeal from his guilty plea.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

He

Yes, but if -- but I have

21

to be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have

22

to respond to the argument of the other side, which is

23

that the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended

24

this to be final and not beyond 90 days is that if you

25

don't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal.

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

explain to me why that isn't so.

2

MR. HEYTENS:

A couple of reasons, Your

3

Honor:

First of all, I think it's actually one of the

4

strongest arguments against their position, because it

5

creates the unlikely scenario where it will be

6

routinely -- we know that Congress has authorized these

7

determinations to be made up to 90 days after the

8

imposition of sentence.

9

situation where it would be completely consistent with

So their rule would create the

10

Congress's intent to routinely create a situation where

11

a Federal criminal defendant has to wait 3 months after

12

sentencing until he can appeal.

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which is just what you say

he has to do if the sentence is supervised release.
MR. HEYTENS:

15

What I'm saying, Justice

16

Breyer, is I -- I -- I know there is a statute that

17

governs imprisonment.

18

statute that governs a sentence of probation.

19
20

I believe there is a similar

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What was that statute on

imprisonment?

21

MR. HEYTENS:

18 U.S.C. 3582(b), Justice

22

Scalia.

I know there is a statute that governs that.

23

We also know there is a statute governing a term of

24

restitution itself.

25

which is reproduced at 11a of the appendix to our

That's the provision cited, 3664(o),

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

brief --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. HEYTENS:

I've got it.

-- which is the rules

4

governing finality with regard to an order imposing

5

restitution.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Heytens, one problem

7

with the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that

8

that time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the

9

defendant misses that deadline, no appeal.

And we’re

10

leaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says,

11

within -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction

12

and sentence, but I'm still thinking about the

13

restitution.
The defendant has to know at that point,

14
15

must I appeal that first judgment?

16

I'll never be able to appeal it.

17

Because if I don't,

But on your reading, the defendant can't

18

wait.

19

must meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the

20

sentence.

21

When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant

MR. HEYTENS:

That's correct,

22

Justice Ginsburg.

In our view, the defendant -- when

23

the judgment of conviction was imposed on this case,

24

which imposed a sentence of imprisonment on Mr. Dolan,

25

the time for appealing the judgment of conviction and

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the term of imprisonment began to run.

2
3
4

If I could go back to Justice Breyer's
question -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that -- that would

5

mean even if the judge says, I’m going to impose the

6

restitution order 10 days from now, defendant's time

7

clock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time

8

the sentence is imposed, not 10 days later when

9

restitution is --

10

MR. HEYTENS:

That's correct.

He files a

11

notice of appeal when the judgment of conviction

12

is entered, and then 10 days later he can file a second

13

notice of appeal, and courts of appeal can consolidate

14

that case in the ordinary course.

15

You don't -- to answer Justice Breyer's very

16

specific question about the supervised released, I have

17

been advised that a district court cannot impose a term

18

of supervised release unless it also imposes a sentence

19

of imprisonment.

20

Justice Breyer raised wouldn't arise.

21

can't just --

22

So that particular hypothetical that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The court

Counsel, let's --

23

let's suppose there’s no 3664(d)(5), and we’re back to

24

just 363(a)(1), which says when sentencing a defendant,

25

the court shall order restitution.

41
Alderson Reporting Company

What if the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judge doesn't -- is that mandatory?

2

sentencing the defendant?

3
4
5

MR. HEYTENS:

It has to be when

I don't think so, Your Honor.

I think what -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think even

6

without 3664(d)(5), the judge can say:

7

when I'm sentencing I’ve got to order restitution.

8

But 2 months later, he can do it?

9

MR. HEYTENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, let me

10

amend my answer slightly.

11

to do it when sentencing --

12
13

He -- the judge is required

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
happens if he doesn't.

I know it says

Yes, but nothing

Is that --

14

MR. HEYTENS:

15

becomes one of a remedy.

16

and the question becomes what is the remedy when the

17

court does not.

18

Montalvo-Murillo is that we presume that Federal

19

district courts will comply with the law, and that it is

20

inappropriate in situations where Congress doesn't

21

specify a remedy for courts to impose their own remedy.

22

That was exactly the situation in Montalvo-Murillo.

23
24
25

Well, the question then
The court is required to do it,

And what the Court said in

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why don't we go back to my

hypothetical -MR. HEYTENS:

Sure.

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and just substitute the

2

word "fine" for "supervised release."

3

MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Breyer, I’m -- I’m fairly

4

certain there is a statute that addresses the finality

5

when it comes to a sentence that imposes a term of a

6

fine, which is similar to the statute that addresses

7

finality of a judgment of conviction that imposes only

8

a term of imprisonment.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not -- I'm not an

10

expert in this area, as you can see.

11

to have a place to go to look so that I can see that

12

these things, in your view, all work out, and you’re

13

not creating some odd appellate system.

14

suggestions for me as to what I could go and read and

15

look at that would help me?
MR. HEYTENS:

16

And -- and I need

Do you have any

Justice Breyer, to address

17

your very specific fine question, there is in fact a

18

statute that addresses that as well.

19

3572(c).

20

section regarding judgments of imprisonment that I

21

quoted to the Court earlier, and Congress has addressed

22

that.

23

sentence to pay a fine can subsequently be altered in

24

various respects, a judgment that includes such a

25

sentence is a final judgment for all other" --

That is 18 U.S.C.

It's structured very similarly to the -- the

It says:

"Notwithstanding the fact that a

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can the (o) -- you

remember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)?

3

MR. HEYTENS:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Can that be

5

read to refer to initial -- an initial judgment of

6

restitution as well as an amended judgment?

7

MR. HEYTENS:

Absolutely, Justice Breyer.

8

That's exactly what the First Circuit said in the Cheal

9

case, which is cited in our brief.

The First Circuit in

10

that case addressed an initial judgment that said,

11

similarly, somewhat, to the judgment in this one -- the

12

original judgment, if you recall, in this case says the

13

Mandatory Victims Restitution Act is applicable;

14

however, the court does not have sufficient information

15

to calculate restitution at this time.

16

Circuit reasoned in Cheal is that that can be

17

interpreted as a judgment imposing a restitution

18

obligation, which is thus final under subsection (o).

19

If you conclude that, you don't need to look at any

20

other statute to resolve --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

What the First

Even though there’s no

amount given?
MR. HEYTENS:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

Because

24

the one thing we know for certain is that even if it had

25

stated an amount, the fact that the amount can be amended

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

later doesn't deprive the judgment of finality.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

May I ask this -Simply because when you

4

state an amount, that amount can be amended later, that

5

leads to the conclusion that you need not even state an

6

amount?

7

say:

8

many years, but I'm going to send you to prison.

9

that appealable right away?

Do you do the same thing for imprisonment?

You

I'm going to send you to prison; I'm not sure how

10

MR. HEYTENS:

Is

Well, Justice Scalia, the

11

district court is not permitted to do any of this.

12

Congress has required the district court to set the

13

amount -JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

I understand that, but

15

district courts don't always do what they are supposed

16

to.

17

you're --

And it seems to me a very strange result that

MR. HEYTENS:

18

It's true that, regrettably,

19

district courts sometimes don't do what they are

20

supposed to.

21

Montalvo-Murillo, is that we should assume that they

22

will, and that it’s inappropriate for courts to craft

23

legal rules that are based on the presumption that they

24

are going to violate their legal obligations.

25

What this Court has said, most notably in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hypothetical?

2

when he's sentenced, and then 90 days later, they impose

3

a restitution order and he appeals from that.

4

raise the issues about guilt and innocence and error in

5

the trial in that appeal?

6

Supposing the defendant fails to appeal

MR. HEYTENS:

May he

Justice Stevens, just to make

7

sure I understand -- I want to make sure I understand

8

the hypothetical -- it's that the district court

9

sentences him, enters a judgment of conviction, and then

10

90 days later imposes an order of restitution?

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

MR. HEYTENS:

Correct.

Okay.

In that situation, no.

13

It is the government's view that he has -- the time for

14

appealing the judgment of conviction and the sentence of

15

imprisonment has run.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

16
17

But he -- he can appeal

just the restitution order.
MR. HEYTENS:

18

Just the restitution order, in

19

that situation, yes.

Now, if he has appealed them both,

20

they can be consolidated, which has been done in several

21

cases in the courts --

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

MR. HEYTENS:

24
25

No, I understand that.

-- in the circuit court of

appeals.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You attach no significance

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the fact that in this case the judge said:

2

order restitution?

3

at all about restitution, so far as you are concerned?

4

I shall

It's the same as if he said nothing

MR. HEYTENS:

We think this makes it an

5

easier case, in terms of it establishes that there is no

6

conceivable prejudice to Mr. Dolan as a result of the

7

delay in this case.

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:
question:

Let me ask you this

If we conclude there’s a hole in the statute

10

that Congress has to amend, is it more likely that

11

Congress will cure the statute if we rule for you or if

12

we rule against you?

13

that, isn't it?

14

It's pretty clear, the answer to

MR. HEYTENS:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

I think

15

Montalvo-Murillo supplies the answer to that.

16

Montalvo-Murillo says, where Congress does not supply a

17

remedy for violation of a statutory time obligation, it

18

is inappropriate for courts to invent their own in order

19

to coerce district courts into complying --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So this then becomes a

21

goal, not a time line -- a deadline?

22

MR. HEYTENS:

I think -- at some point, it

23

becomes a debate over precise wording, Justice Ginsburg.

24

I think it is a deadline.

25

district courts to do this.

I think Congress intended for
I think district courts who

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws

2

of the United States are required to do it.
The question is:

3
4

What is the remedy in the

rare, regrettable situation where they do not do it?

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So a -- a defendant

6

who is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides,

7

that's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then

8

finds out, you know, 90 days later he has got to pay a

9

million dollars in restitution, is just out of luck,

10
11

And --

right?
MR. HEYTENS:

Well, that would be -- yes.

12

That would be our view, Mr. Chief Justice.

Now, what I

13

would say is, it is, first of all, our view that the Court

14

doesn't need to resolve any of this.

15

one of the reasons is there is another way the Court

16

could resolve this, which is to follow the approach the

17

Court took in its decision in Corey v. United States,

18

which is cited in the blue brief.

But, second of all,

19

Now, Corey involved a statute.

20

presentence -- it's pre-Federal sentencing guidelines.

21

It involves a statute that said if, at the time of the

22

sentencing, the district court feels like it needs more

23

information to decide how long to send the defendant to

24

jail for, it may commit the defendant to the discretion

25

of the Attorney General for a period of either 3 to

48
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

6 months; get, essentially, a PSR, before there were

2

PSRs; and then make a determination then.
The Court in Corey faced the question:

3

When

4

the district court does that -- it says, I'm going to

5

give you to the Attorney General, and we'll come back in

6

6 months and decide what your sentence will be -- when

7

does the defendant have to appeal?

8

question before the Court in Corey.

9

That was the

What the Court said in Corey is that the

10

defendant may appeal either at the time he is committed

11

to the discretion of the Attorney General or at the time

12

the district court imposes the final sentence.

13

reason the Court said that -- this is the language

14

that's cited in the blue brief -- is the Court said it

15

would be extraordinary to tell a Federal criminal

16

defendant that he might have to wait up to 6 months in

17

order to take a notice of appeal from his judgment of

18

conviction.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

out, from your point of view.

21

up again.

22
23
24
25

The

Look, you straightened me
But now you've mixed me

(Laughter.)
MR. HEYTENS:

Sorry.

I didn’t realize,

Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Because I think you said

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the defendant is just out of luck.

2

you had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you

3

were saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is

4

immediately appealable and must be appealed within

5

14 days because of that 3582.

6

MR. HEYTENS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But, previously,

That's our -And then you said (o)

8

applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an

9

order of restitution is a final judgment.

So if (o)

10

applies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later,

11

that restitution is made final and embodied in another

12

judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be

13

appealed.
So if you’re right about (o) applying, then

14
15

the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of

16

luck.

17

be on your side in this question.

18

(Laughter.)

Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to

19

MR. HEYTENS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21
22

No -I’ve got to figure this

out.
MR. HEYTENS:

I apologize, Justice Breyer.

23

The government's position is that at the time the

24

judgment of conviction and the sentence of imprisonment

25

are entered, that is the time at which the defendant has

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to appeal and, in our view, he may appeal.

2

the sentence of restitution is imposed, that is when

3

he appeals that.

4

Later, when

What I was suggesting is that, to the extent

5

the Court has any concern about that, the alternative

6

way of resolving this issue would be the same way the

7

Court approached the issue in Corey, and you could say

8

that the defendant could appeal at either time.

9

Now, we think that would be incorrect, but

10

it would be open to the Court to do so to -- or to leave

11

the issue open in order to resolve this case.

12

as I said before, this defendant never attempted to

13

appeal his judgment of conviction or his original term

14

of imprisonment.

15

to decide what exactly would have happened had he

16

attempted to do so.

17

Because

So it's not, in this case, necessary

JUSTICE SCALIA:

restitution -- I assume it's the judge who finds that the

victim suffered so much money?

Just more likely than not?

That's correct.
And it's a criminal --

it's a criminal judgment?

5

MR. HEYTENS:

That's what Congress has

6

provided.

And in this Court's decision in Oregon v.

7

Ice, the Court, admittedly in dictum, stated that

8

restitution determinations are a category of

9

determinations that have been historically made by the

10

court, not by the jury.

11

thinks is the answer to that question, it is certainly

12

not within the question presented.

13

raised at any point by the Petitioner in this case.

14

And regardless of what anyone

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It has not been

I suppose that an answer to

15

the Chief Justice's concern about the 1-week sentence and

16

-- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal

17

defendants know that an adjudication of guilt is

18

preclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil

19

-- civil liability, and they take their chances.

20

But that -- that points up a difference

21

between this case and Montalvo-Murillo.

22

finality is central to the system, and that wasn't --

23

that's not really -- wasn't really true in Montalvo.

24
25

MR. HEYTENS:
Justice Kennedy.

In this case,

That's certainly correct,

That was by its terms a bail

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

determination, which by its nature is not a final

2

determination in the sense that a criminal statute is,

3

though the Court's language doesn't really suggest that

4

that would make any difference.

5

some of the other cases in this same line of cases,

6

including some of the ones Justice Breyer mentioned, did

7

raise finality concerns.

8

finality concern raised in the Peabody Coal case.

9

were finality concerns raised in Brock, that Congress

And I would say that

There was a very strong
There

10

had said this needs to be done, and once it’s done, it

11

needs to be done.

12

cases in this same line have also involved finality,

13

admittedly not in the criminal context.

And so, there are -- some of the

14

But I think the -- the most important thing

15

that the Court said in -- the two most important things

16

that the Court said in Montalvo-Murillo, as are relevant

17

here, is that, first, when Congress doesn't specify a

18

remedy -- and Congress has not specified a remedy in

19

this case -- it’s inappropriate for courts to impose

20

their own.

21

The second thing that the Court said is that

22

we should presume that Federal district courts are going

23

to comply with legal obligations, and we shouldn't make

24

rules based on the assumption that they won't.

25

And third is that when courts do impose

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

remedies, they shouldn't make -- impose a remedy where

2

there’s a profound lack of fit between the violation that

3

occurred and the remedy that the defendant is asking

4

them to impose.

5

Let me give you an example on that.

The

6

general rule in Federal criminal litigation is that the

7

Federal district court is supposed to impose sentence

8

without unnecessary delay.

Now, say the district court

9

violates that obligation.

It takes too long to impose a

10

sentence.

11

that the remedy of a district court's unnecessary delay

12

in sentencing the defendant means the defendant should

13

get off scot-free.

14

I think it would be extraordinary to suggest

The remedy is to tell the district court you

15

have taken too long to impose the sentence; impose the

16

sentence forthwith.

17

The same thing is true here.

Congress has

18

told the district court you need to impose restitution

19

in every case where the defendant is convicted of a

20

crime of violence.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, your argument is

22

“not to exceed 90 days” means the same thing as “without

23

undue delay”?

24
25

MR. HEYTENS:

We don't think it means the

same thing, Mr. Chief Justice.

What we think it means

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is the violation should have the same consequences.

2

violation is to say if you don't do what you are

3

supposed to, the remedy is to do it immediately.

4

remedy isn't to say you don't have to do it anymore.

Thank you, counsel.

Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. KARLAN:

12

I have three points -- excuse

13

me -- to make:

14

here and what the error is here.

15

occurred when the district court did not impose

16

restitution.

17

appeal under Rule 4.

18

government did not appeal the failure to make

19

restitution.

20
21
22

The first goes to what the remedy is
The error here

The government should have filed a timely
They had 30 days to do so.

The

That error is not before this Court now.
What’s before this Court is a second judgment.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They couldn't do that

23

until the end of the 90 days.

24

to order restitution, that's a vicious cycle argument.

25

MS. KARLAN:

If the judge has 90 days

No, Justice Sotomayor, because

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

had the -- had the government on October 28 looked and

2

said, there’s no restitution order in this case, they

3

could have filed an appeal then under Rule 4, and they

4

would have won.

They didn't do so.

5

Second --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that’s rather

7

theoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge

8

surely would have acted before he could process an

9

appeal.

10

MS. KARLAN:

Well, he lacks actually the --

11

the power to do that.

12

can't do that.

13

critical rule to understand is one sentence, one appeal.

14

So turning first --

And may I just say that here I think the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16

Once the appeal is taken, he

But that's not true.

don't know if you’ve had time to look at 3582 or 35 --

17

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, I have.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Those do appear to say

19

that once there’s a term of imprisonment, that that

20

constitutes a final judgment.

21

MS. KARLAN:

But they do so in the context

22

of Section 3553(a), which is cited on page 6 of the

23

yellow brief, which says “the court shall impose a

24

sentence.”

25

Now, the different components can each be

2

case on a particular charge, and that sentence can

3

include restitution, it can include a fine, it can

4

include imprisonment.

5

sentences.

6

is there a final judgment.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

forfeiture.

But there is one sentence in a criminal

That doesn't make it three

And only when all of those have been imposed

It can also include

What’s -- what is the rule for forfeiture?
MS. KARLAN:

9

Until then, the judgment --

I don't know the rule for

10

forfeiture.

11

proceedings, which is 3582(b), to which the government

12

refers; 3572(c) for fines; 3562(b) for community

13

release; and 3664(o) for restitution.

14

to make one sentence, and then there is one appeal.

15

I do know the rule for all of the other criminal

All of those have

Under our rule, which I think comports with

16

the plain language of the statute, we know when an

17

appeal takes place, and there will be one appeal.

18

the government's rule --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Under

What is the difference -- in

20

response to the last argument that your opponent made,

21

what is the difference between the provision here and

22

Rule 32(b)(1) of the criminal rules, the court must

23

impose sentence without unnecessary delay?

24
25

MS. KARLAN:

There, the question is, did it

do it without unnecessary delay?

Here the question is,

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

did it do it within 90 days?

2

government had to appeal.

3

that.

4

When it didn't, the

The government did not do

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if the -- I didn't

5

understand the answer.

6

without unnecessary delay, the consequence is that there

7

can be no sentence?

8
9

MS. KARLAN:

If the sentence is not imposed

No.

This Court has never

decided what the rule means there.

10

statute.

11

the statute --

And if I could turn to the question of what

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

But this is a

Before you do that, tell me

13

what the government appeal would consist of.

14

has expired -MS. KARLAN:

15
16

The 90 days

And the judgment of August 8th

became final.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you -- you tell

18

me the court -- the court has no ability to impose

19

restitution after 90 days.
MS. KARLAN:

20

That’s right.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MS. KARLAN:

23

What's the use of appealing?

Because on appeal you say the

court erred, and it imposed an illegal sentence -JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

The --

And the appellate court says

too bad --

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MS. KARLAN:

1

No --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA -- 90 days are up.

3

MS. KARLAN:

No, Justice Scalia.

In the

4

same way that if a court failed to impose a mandatory minimum

5

sentence and there was a final judgment, the government

6

could appeal.

7

didn't do that doesn't mean anything at that point.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

And the fact that the initial sentence

There is no time limit on

the mandatory minimum.
MS. KARLAN:

10

But the -- but -- but, Your

11

Honor, if the government appeals an illegal sentence,

12

that sentence can be corrected and the new mandate from

13

the court of appeals saying you erred in not imposing

14

mandatory restitution starts the 90-day clock again.

15

Now, this is -JUSTICE BREYER:

16

Could you go back to --

17

could you go back to Justice Alito's question,

18

because --

19

MS. KARLAN:

Yes.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that was exactly the

21

same thing.

I think what he may be saying, though, is

22

it makes more sense to read these statutes as saying

23

imprisonment or community -- or community service, a

24

form of supervised release, or fines -- I don't know

25

about forfeiture -- can be appealed as separate final

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judgments, because then you don't have to wait for

2

90 days.

3

MS. KARLAN:

No.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if you read it that

5

way, it's fairer to the defendant, and you don't have to

6

worry about the restitution appeal because of (o).

7
8
9

Now, what blocks the reading -- what blocks
the reading I just gave?
MS. KARLAN:

The principle that there must

10

be one sentence that determines each of the punishments

11

for a particular crime.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
