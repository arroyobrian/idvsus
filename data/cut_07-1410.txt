We will hear

argument first today in Case 07-1410, United States v.

5

Navajo Nation.

General Kneedler.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

Six years ago this Court rejected the Navajo

12

Nation's claim for damages in connection with the same

13

action that is before the Court here, the Secretary's

14

approval of amendments to the tribe's mineral lease in

15

the mid-1980s. The Court held there that in order for

16

the United States to be held liable under the Tucker Act

17

or the Indian Tucker Act, the claimant must specify at

18

the threshold a specific rights-creating or

19

duty-imposing statutory or regulatory prescription that

20

the government has allegedly violated.

21

The Court found no warrant in any relevant

22

statute or regulation to impose liability on the United

23

States.

24

approval of the royalty rates in the tribe's lease was

25

governed by the Indian Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, or

In particular, the Court concluded that the

3

Alderson Reporting Company

IMLA.

2

there was no, quote, "textual basis," close quote, in

3

any pertinent statutory or regulatory provision that

4

required the Secretary to insist that the tribe

5

negotiate for a higher rate.

6

Looking at IMLA's framework, the Court held that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it said

7

"pertinent or relevant," but surely that's limited to

8

the statutory provisions that we examined in the case.

9

GEN. KNEEDLER:

But I think the way to look

10

at it is what the Court said, that it found no warrant

11

in any relevant statute or regulation, and it discussed

12

not just IMLA but several other statutes which -- which

13

did have to do with the economic -- excuse me -- the

14

economic terms of leases, but -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

GEN. KNEEDLER:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the question -

-- didn't govern.
But the question

18

presented, General Kneedler, was limited to IMLA, to the

19

Mineral Leasing Act.

20

GEN. KNEEDLER:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22
23

Well That was the government's

question presented.
GEN. KNEEDLER:

Two things about that.

The

24

government's question presented was that the Court could

25

not find the United States liable or -- was whether the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court could find the United States liable without

2

finding a violation of IMLA.

3

of the question was, without finding a violation of

4

IMLA, the United States could not be liable, and the

5

Court found no violation of IMLA.

6

And therefore, the premise

But beyond that, the tribe's principal

7

submission in this Court was that the United States had

8

control through a network of statutes, including the

9

ones they rely on here.

But the Court also itself on

10

page 30 of its brief in that case identified the

11

relevant statute as being IMLA and the other two that

12

this Court discussed and the general introduction to the

13

Rehabilitation Act.

14

So I think the structure of the Court's

15

opinion, looking at the way the tribe serves it up, the

16

Court said there has to be a specific violation of a -

17

of a statutory regulatory prescription.

18

that the relevant one was IMLA, and it found no

19

violation.

20

tribe's claim, not simply arguments made in favor of the

21

claim, must fail.

22

The Court found

And therefore -- and the Court also said the

But if the Court concludes that its prior

23

decision did not absolutely foreclose the litigation, we

24

think it's clear that the framework that this Court

25

announced in -- or reaffirmed in Navajo 1 itself does
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

foreclose the claim here.

2

concluded that IMLA is the statute that governs the

3

approval of royalty terms in coal leases.

4

As I said, the Court

On remand, the Federal Circuit relied on two

5

other statutes addressing other subjects, the Surface

6

Mining Reclamation and Control Act, which has to do with

7

the regulation of environmental issues and matters that

8

may arise in connection with a coal lease, and the

9

Hopi-Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950, which set in

10

motion a general governmental program to rehabilitate

11

and improve the economic life of the Navajo and Hopi

12

Indians.

13

But neither of those statutes had anything

14

to do with the approval of the economic terms of coal

15

leases.

16

the Federal Circuit on remand held the United States

17

liable on the basis of two statutes that have nothing to

18

do with coal leasing, minus the statute that did have

19

something to do with coal leasing, in our view shows how

20

far the Federal Circuit has strayed from this Court's

21

teachings.

22

That was governed by IMLA.

So the fact that

But beyond that, we think it's a fortiori

23

that the court of appeals erred in its alternative

24

holding, which was that the United States could be held

25

liable on the basis of general common law principles.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act provide that

2

the United States may be liable only for a violation of

3

an act of Congress or a regulation.

4

reason that this Court stated in Navajo -- in the Navajo

5

1 case that there has to be a violation of a specific

6

statutory or regulatory provision.

7

And it was for that

Even as a general matter, under this Court's

8

jurisprudence, there is only a very limited role for

9

Federal common law, but that is especially so when what

10

we are talking about here is liability for damages under

11

a waiver of sovereign immunity, and the usual sovereign

12

immunity principles have to cast considerable doubt on

13

that.

14

pursuant to congressionally conferred authority can

15

provide for the payment of money out of the Federal

16

Treasury under our Constitution.

Only an act of Congress or a regulation adopted

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there cases in the

18

courts of appeals where Indian tribes litigate with the

19

Secretary and claim an abuse of discretion for the way

20

in which the Secretary performs the duties with respect

21

to Indian lands?

22

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Under the Administrative

23

Procedure Act, there could be -- there could be claims

24

brought, but those would not be for money damages.

25

They're 7

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I recognize that, but

2

I want to know, is there a body of law in the Federal

3

Circuit that generally recognizes that the -- that the

4

Secretary has a fiduciary obligation that's enforceable

5

as a matter of administrative law?

6

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Not in the Federal Circuit,

7

to my knowledge, because -- because the Administrative

8

Procedure Act -

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I meant all of the

circuits.

11

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

No -- in the -- under

12

the Administrative Procedure Act -- I'm not -- just like

13

any party could claim -- could challenge what was done

14

by the Department taking particular administrative

15

action.

And I think there -- I think that was what -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what I was asking

17

was whether there was some doctrine that the -- that the

18

trustee -- that the Secretary acts in a capacity, a

19

fiduciary capacity as a trustee.

20

out there, then that might be the basis for saying that

21

it's a sufficient foundation for a money damages.

22

just asking, is that doctrine there?

23

GEN. KNEEDLER:

If that doctrine were

I was

No, not -- not in the way

24

you put it.

But there are cases that certainly talk

25

about this, that the Secretary has trust
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

responsibilities.

2

that concept can be used.

3

sense in that the United States Government, through

4

treaties or a general sense of moral responsibility,

5

should look out for the Indians, and in the day-to-day

6

administration of Indian affairs, to contemplate a trust

7

responsibility is simply to mean that the United States

8

has a special relationship and should deal in that

9

manner.

10

But there are a lot of ways in which
It can be used in a political

And under the Administrative Procedure Act,

11

if there is -- if there is an action the United States

12

takes under a statute that governs Indian affairs, that

13

would be -- that would be subject to judicial review

14

under the general principles, is it arbitrary and

15

capricious under normal principles, does substantial

16

evidence sustain the determination?

17

But, particularly in a suit for money

18

damages under the -- under the Tucker Act and where

19

Congress has said there has to be a violation of a

20

money-mandating statute or regulation, general common

21

law principles do not suffice.

22

damages, only Congress or an executive agency under -

23

acting pursuant to congressional authority under the

24

Constitution can provide for the payment of -- of money

25

out of the Federal Treasury.

As I said, for money

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- this may be a

2

purely academic distinction, but you talked in terms of

3

liability.

4

do not set a standard to which the Secretary is bound,

5

or simply that they don't constitute a waiver of

6

sovereign immunity?

7

Are you suggesting that the trust principles

GEN. KNEEDLER:

I think it's really both.

8

The general trust principles, at least -- at least again

9

under Tucker Act jurisprudence, general trust principles

10

are not what establish the Secretary's duties.

11

acts of Congress that impose duties on the Secretary in

12

this area as in any other, or regulations the Secretary

13

has prescribed under it.

14

It's the

Now under this Court's jurisprudence, the

15

Court has said that the notion of trust is relevant at

16

the second stage of the analysis.

17

the threshold requirement that there be a specific

18

statute or regulation that imposes duties or rights.

19

the Court finds that, then at the second stage, as this

20

Court has held in Mitchell 2 and indicated in Navajo as

21

well, that may be relevant to determine whether those

22

specific duty-imposing statutes in turn also impose

23

monetary liability on the United States for violation.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

The first stage is

Under both IMLA and the

Rehabilitation Act, leases have to be approved by the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Secretary.

2

Doesn't that impose a duty on the Secretary?
GEN. KNEEDLER:

Well, what the Court said in

3

Navajo specifically with respect to IMLA, the Secretary,

4

yes, does have to approve it, but the Court specifically

5

rejected the proposition that there was any basis for

6

liability stemming from the Secretary's approval of the

7

lease.

8
9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, under the

Rehabilitation Act, if it applied to this lease, what
would the Secretary's duty be?

11

GEN. KNEEDLER:

Section 5 of the

12

Rehabilitation Act for approval of leases is essentially

13

the same as IMLA.

14

approve the lease.

15

or in Navajo 1, the theory of IMLA is not to have the

16

Secretary be responsible or to take the lead in leasing

17

tribal lands for coal purposes.

18

to the approval, and the Court concluded it would be

19

inconsistent with that arrangement for the Secretary to

20

second-guess the determinations that the secretary had

21

made.

22

expressly rejected that the Secretary was required to

23

insist that the tribe negotiate a higher amount when it

24

renegotiated the lease.

25

It provides for the Secretary to
But, as this Court held in IMLA -

It's the tribe, subject

And the Court -- the argument was made there and

JUSTICE ALITO:

The Secretary has to apply
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some standard, presumably.

2

GEN. KNEEDLER:

What is it?
What -- what the secretary

3

has adopted -- has done is by regulation, is to say that

4

-- that there is a minimum that the tribe cannot go

5

below.

6

of this lease in 1987, from 1984 to 1987, there was a

7

minimum of 10 percent or 10 cents per ton.

8

was getting 37.5 cents per ton.

9

renegotiated in connection with a clause in the lease

At the time -- at the time of the renegotiation

The tribe

This lease was

10

that allowed adjustments for reasonable rates, which is

11

not the same thing as maximizing the tribe's -- the

12

tribe's revenues, so the Secretary had a regulation at

13

the time of 10 cents per ton.

14

regulation that says the minimum royalty rate will be

15

12.5 percent, which, as Court pointed out in Navajo 1,

16

is the standard royalty rate for Federal and tribal

17

leases throughout the United States.

18

The Secretary now has a

Now, what is significant, in further

19

response to your question, is that regulation states

20

that that minimum rate is 12.5 percent unless the

21

Secretary determines that a lower rate would be in the

22

best interest of the Indians.

23

then, the way the Secretary has implemented it, it's

24

basically up to the tribe to negotiate something at or

25

above the minimum.

So the way this works

If it's below the minimum that the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Secretary's prescribed, the Secretary has to make a

2

judgment that that going lower, maybe because of a

3

geological conditions or whatever, is in the best

4

interest of the Indians.

5

out -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

in the Rehabilitation Act?

8

GEN. KNEEDLER:

9

And that is -- that is borne

IMLA regulation.

Is that in IMLA or is that

That's in IMLA.

That's an

The general regulations that implement

10

the Rehabilitation Act have a similar provision.

11

don't talk about royalties, which I think is telling

12

because royalties have to do with coal leases.

13

talk about -- they require it be a fair rental for

14

property, not a maximum rental but a fair rental.

15

then it has the same sort of thing, that if it's going

16

to be below the fair market value it has to be in the

17

best interest of the Indians.

18

They

They

And

And I think it's instructive that I know

19

there's been an argument that this lease is governed by

20

-- by the Rehabilitation Act rather than IMLA, and

21

notwithstanding what this Court held in Navajo 1 six

22

years ago, but in 1999 when Secretary Babbitt, who

23

joined the brief arguing this is covered by the

24

Rehabilitation Act, approved the amendments to the lease

25

in 1999, he approved it under the IMLA regulations and
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

he specifically said that because the minimum royalty

2

rate is 12.5 percent -- he is quoting the applicable

3

regulation -- "I do not have to decide whether the

4

royalty rate is in the best interest of the Indians."

5

He went on to say:

"But I think it is."

6

So secretary Babbitt's approval of those

7

amendments really explains the way the Secretary has

8

implemented the statutory scheme, and we think that's

9

certainly well within the Secretary's discretion under a

10

statute that did not impose any limitations.

11

respect to the Rehabilitation Act, the general leasing

12

provision of that act, as we've explained in our brief,

13

does not apply to mineral leases.

14

governed by IMLA after 1950.

15

is nothing in section 5 that imposes any more specific

16

duties with respect to royalty terms or any other terms

17

than IMLA itself.

18

leases for surface users, business purposes basically.

19

And that was put in there because at the time there was

20

no provision for long-term leases if somebody wanted to

21

bring a surface commercial venture onto a reservation.

22

With

That continued to be

But even if it did, there

Section 5 has to do with surface -

But the last sentence of section 5 of the -

23

of the act on page 171a of the petition appendix says

24

that:

"Nothing contained in section 5 shall affect the

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the authority under any other act of Congress."

2

section -- and the other act of Congress here is IMLA.

3

So

I think it's also -- I think it's also

4

instructive to point out not only did this Court hold

5

the last time around that the lease was governed by

6

IMLA, that was the tribe's position in this case.

7

proposed findings of fact indeed in the Court of Federal

8

Claims, pages 524 and 525 of the joint appendix, said

9

the lease was governed by IMLA.

10

Its

But the textual dispositive point is that

11

the lease couldn't have been entered into under the

12

Rehabilitation Act.

13

that the lease would be for a term of 10 years and then

14

subject to a further extension for as long as minerals

15

are produced in paying quantities.

16

language is repeated in the lease, which shows that it

17

was under IMLA.

18

The lease in this case provided

That precise

Under section 5 of the Rehabilitation Act,

19

the lease could only be for an initial term of 25 years

20

and then a further term of 25 more years.

21

have allowed for this sort of lease here and indeed,

22

because the initial lease term here was 10 years and

23

then could have only been 25 more years under the Rehab

24

Act, this lease would have had to expire in 1999, and

25

yet it was amended at that time and continues in effect
15
Alderson Reporting Company

It wouldn't

and mining continues under it.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The other side says that

3

certain standard provisions in the IMLA leases did not

4

exist in this lease.

5

Is that accurate?

GEN. KNEEDLER:

No.

Well, they said -- I

6

think -- the only thing I think they say along those

7

lines is that -- has to do with the form of the lease.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

GEN. KNEEDLER:

With the forms?
The form on which the lease

10

is used.

11

provisions that appear in regulations under general

12

statutes that are related to leases.

13

the property can't be used for unlawful purposes, and

14

I'm forgetting what the second one was.

15

be unusual that the Secretary might borrow or a tribe

16

might borrow provisions from other leases and put them

17

in this lease.

18

I think what they said is there were several

One has to do with

But it wouldn't

This is -- again, IMLA provides for

19

negotiation.

20

particular provisions of lease.

21

there might be things that would parallel what were in

22

the other leases we don't think is really dispositive.

23

So the parties are free to put in
So that the fact that

Also, the other significant thing is that

24

the lease itself incorporates or refers to by reference

25

the IMLA regulations.

So even if somehow the lease were
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

thought to be governed by Section 5, even though that

2

wasn't what it was issued under, the IMLA regulations

3

would control, and this Court already held in Navajo 1

4

that those IMLA regulations, which are in the lease, do

5

not impose any -- did not impose any -- did not impose

6

any duty on the Secretary with respect to the approval,

7

approval of the lease.

8
9

I should also point out that when the -- we
cite this in our briefs, that at the time the lease

10

amendments were approved in 1987 the Solicitor's Office

11

did a legal review of the propriety of the lease

12

amendments and that legal review expressly says that the

13

lease was entered into under IMLA.

14

So I think the circumstances are really

15

overwhelming that it was entered into under IMLA and

16

that the Rehabilitation Act lease provision does not

17

have anything to do with this lease.

18

general emanation from the Rehabilitation Act that the

19

tribe seeks to rely on here are too general and short.

20

The Rehabilitation Act was enacted in 1950 in

21

recognition that the plight of the Navajo and Hopi was

22

very serious, and Congress undertook to study resources

23

and put in the infrastructure and that sort of thing,

24

and part of it was to have programs -- excuse me -

25

studies to determine what the tribe's coal resources
17
Alderson Reporting Company

And the more

were, and that was done, and this lease grew out of

2

that.

governed by the Rehabilitation Act.

But that doesn't mean that it was in any way

16

the Court should reiterate the analytical framework that

17

it put forward in -- in its decision the last time

around so that there will be no mistaking the way these

19

cases are to be handled in the Federal circuit in the

20

future by requiring that the threshold, a -- as I said,

21

a specific statutory or regulatory provision that

22

imposes duties and not in particular looking at general

23

notions of common law that -- that might arise out of -

24

out of some sort of -- some sort of factual control.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, General.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I think I would like to start with Justice

22

Alito's question because he said:

Doesn't Section 5 of

23

the Rehabilitation Act specifically require the

24

Secretary to approve this lease?

25

conceded that it does.

And Mr. Kneedler

And so then the question is:
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Doesn't that create some kind of a duty?

And it seems

2

to me clearly it does, just as the Court I think

3

implicitly said in Navajo 1, the difference between

4

Navajo 1 and Navajo 2 being that this Court then went on

5

to examine IMLA, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.

6

It concluded that IMLA very specifically for

7

the entirety of native Americans and for the entirety of

8

Indian mineral leasing had a preference to ensure that

9

the Indian tribes themselves would -- would attain a

10

certain self sufficiency.

11

the responsibility of having to deal with individual

12

negotiations and allowed it for the tribes to take over.

13

And it essentially advocated

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Phillips, I'm

14

looking at the last paragraph, and it says:

15

warrant from any relevant statute or regulation, et

16

cetera.

17

that was just carelessness on the Court's part?

18

So it wasn't limited to IMLA.

MR. PHILLIPS:

We have no

Do you think

Oh, I would -- I would never

19

assume that, Justice Ginsburg.

I -- I think -- I think

20

the operative term here is "relevant."

21

the Court for purposes of analyzing the question

22

If you say that those were not relevant and,

MR. PHILLIPS:

Not relevant to the question

the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.

12

look at the other two provisions, the opinion of the

the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, it says those don't add

to the Indian Mineral Leasing Act.

Our argument here is that Section 5 of the

on which there is a duty imposed, but that duty is then

implemented in the regulations that are identified in

The -- the language of the statute

So clearly it applies to Indian

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

Where is

8

the specific reference to mineral leases, mineral

9

resources?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

16

Mineral resources.
It says "resources."

I don't remember it saying "mineral resources."
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, the development of the

"resources" for the Navajo and Hopi Indians.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a big

difference, don't you think?

MR. PHILLIPS:

for utilization of natural resources.

19

I'm sorry.

The development

But the basic point there is, at least as I

20

read section 5, what it's saying is that it grants broad

21

leasing authority.

The Solicitor General is absolutely

22

right about that.

But that authority extends to certain

23

kinds of mineral leasing.

24
25

And that says -- and that's an authority and
it's important to recognize this.

Because while it is

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

true for the run-of-the-mill Native Americans who are -

2

who are engaged in mineral leasing it may make sense to

3

say:

approach for the most part.

5

minimum ceiling or a minimum floor and above that you

6

negotiate as hard as you want.

Look, we -- we are going to take a hands-off

We are going to set a

But the -- but the Navajo were in a

8

fundamentally different position in 1950 when this

9

legislation was enacted.

The -- the median education on

10

that -- on that reservation was less than one year of

11

education.

12

The resources were $400 per year annual

13

income.

This was a tribe in horrible condition.

And so

14

it would make perfect sense for Congress to say:

15

for -- for most tribes we want to go ahead and have the

16

approval be based with the -- with the Secretary taking

17

a hands-off approach above a certain minimum, but when

18

you deal with the Navajo -

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Look,

Is it your -- is it your

20

position that it would be -- that it -- it is not lawful

21

for coal on the Navajo Reservation to be leased under

22

IMLA, that the lease would have to be solely under

23

section 5 of the Rehabilitation -

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I don't think it would

have to be solely under it.

false dichotomy.

proposition.

3

reasonably be applied here, and -- and section 5

which would include IMLA, is meant to be superseded by

6

the passage of section 5.

7

I don't think this is an either/or

I think there are parts of IMLA that can

So I think there is a rule.

And I think that the lease -- if you read the

8

lease on its face -- Justice Scalia asked the question:

9

Does this lease conform to the form lease that you get

10
11

under IMLA?

The answer is clearly not.
This is a mix and match between some

12

provisions, it seems to me, that clearly provides

13

additional protection for the Navajo and other

14

provisions that -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the lease -- the lease

16

doesn't follow the -- the requirements of section 5 of

17

the Rehabilitation Act in -- in respect to its term.

18

But what is your -- is it your position that in entering

19

into a lease the tribe has the authority to decide that

20

we want this to be under IMLA; we want this to be under

21

the Rehabilitation Act?

22

Secretary for approval, does the Secretary have the

23

authority to say, I'm going to approve this under IMLA;

24

I'm going to approve it under section 5?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

When it comes up to the

I think the Secretary has to
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

approve it under both of those provisions.

2

that IMLA in this particular context would impose a

3

10-cent minimum over time.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is just

What do you do about the

5

fact that the term of this lease would -- would not be

6

permitted under the Rehabilitation Act?

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think it would be permitted

8

under the Rehabilitation Act because the last sentence

9

of section 5 specifically says that this is not meant to

10

limit any other authority provided under any other

11

statute.

12

durational protections for the tribes under these

13

circumstances, that provision would definitely allow you

14

to use IMLA's time limits rather than the Rehabilitation

15

Act.

16

And since IMLA provides additional time and

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Explain to me the -

17

the relevant scope of IMLA and the Rehab Act.

The -

18

the argument that you made, that you just made, makes

19

perfect sense if the Rehab Act applies to some kinds of

20

-- of leases or contracts that the -- that the IMLA does

21

not.

22

And yet I -- I thought you were saying a

23

little bit earlier that the Rehab Act applies to all

24

mineral leasing, because that would be the development

25

of the natural resource.

And if that is so, then there
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

seems to be a pretty clear conflict, even on your own

2

argument, between the term provisions in the Rehab Act

3

and the term provisions of IMLA with respect to -- to

4

mineral leases.

5

problem for you?

6

How do -- how do we get out of that

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

I think the -- the key

7

distinction is to look at the -- at who is being

8

regulated, and under the Rehabilitation act it's the

9

Navajo and the Hopi.

And -- and Congress said, look, we

10

are going to take special care to protect and to try to

11

put them into a position where they can even just catch

12

up to other Native Americans.

13

And so it seems to me that there is -

14

that's a special protection with a special duty, and

15

that duty is enforced through the 162 regulations.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it's a special

17

protection and special duty that applies to every one of

18

the mineral leases, including this one, that the Navajo

19

may be involved in.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Correct.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So I -- what -- maybe -

22

maybe I missed the point, but would you go back to

23

justice Scalia's question:

24

a conflict here between this lease and the Rehab Act?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

How is it that there is not

Because the last section
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under section 5 says that, notwithstanding anything

2

else, this provision doesn't preclude -- doesn't -

3

doesn't limit the authority that would otherwise exist.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that, in effect -- but

5

that, in effect, is saying this -- this provision will

6

never apply to a mineral lease with the Navajo or the

7

Hopi.

8

with respect to these two tribes.

9
10
11

I mean, you are reading it right out of the act

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which is all that the

Rehabilitation Act -- I'm sorry.
MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm sorry, it's because the

12

provision applies to a lot of other leases, too.

13

you asking when the 20 or 10 and 10.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Are

With respect -- my point is

15

with respect to every mineral lease of the Hopi and the

16

Navajo, you are saying the term provision never applies.

17

Am I correct -

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I understand.

Right.

I

19

have the answer your question which is this provision in

20

section 5 applies not just to mineral lease, it applies

21

to all business site leasing.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it only applies to

23

those two tribes.

And there is something very, very

24

strange, it seems to me, in saying that the -- that the

25

kind of -- the saving sentence at the end of section 5
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reads its very term limit provisions out of every -- out

2

of every possible application for mineral lease by these

3

two tribes.

4

And that's what you are saying.
MR. PHILLIPS:

But -- but -- but the

5

important distinction -- and I hope I can articulate

6

this -- is that section 5 applies beyond mineral leases.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

I realize that.
So that all -- so the time

limitation of 10 years and 10 years, if you bring a

10

barber shop, you want to build a barber shop on those

11

lands, you want to lease the space in order to do that,

12

you would be subject to the section 5 time limitations,

13

unless for some reason there is another authorization

14

somewhere.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But that, in effect,

16

means that -- and I don't want to overdo your barber

17

shop analysis or example, but that, in effect, says -

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

I need a haircut.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- on -- on trivial lease

20

contracts there are term limits, but on the ones that

21

really count, where the real money is, doesn't apply at

22

all.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

There is a -- way beyond that

24

there is an entire defense plant on the Navajo tribe -

25

on the Navajo reservation right now that would obviously
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be subject to precisely these same limitations.

2

not just trivial, it's all business lease citing that is

3

covered why that.

4

So it's

So it seems to me not at all unreasonable to

5

think that Congress, in its -- in its very protective

6

effort here under section 5 would say, here are all the

7

leases that you are allowed to enter into.

8

broad leasing authority, we are going to protect you

9

against overreaching by restricting how long you can go,

You have

10

but if there are other provisions of law that allow

11

these to be modified in a particular area, we will allow

12

those to be modified in that way.

13

And in this context, what that last sentence

14

would, in my mind, say is there is no reason to try

15

and -- to say that IMLA or the Rehabilitation Act.

16

seems to me much more sensible to say that Congress

17

would have intended multiple protections for the Navajo.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It

Let's assume that, and I --

19

I -- I think your argument is well taken.

20

that, don't we also have to assume that the stress in

21

IMLA on placing primary responsibility on the tribes,

22

not on the Secretary should, in fact, also be imported

23

to the application of the Rehab Act as you say it should

24

be applied.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But assuming

But you see I don't

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think that's an authority.

2

read -

I would say -- I would not

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

What's not an authority?
The notion that the Navajo

5

tribe would be in a position to better -- to better -

6

to -- I'm sorry, to achieve self-sufficiency.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

You made a good

8

argument a few moments ago for the fact that it would

9

have been at least at one time inappropriate to thrust

10

that responsibility on the Navajo, but there was no

11

Navajo exception in IMLA.

12

thrust on the Navajo -

That responsibility was

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

I'm sure there isn't -- and this Court

recognized that.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But that's exactly

17

why the Navajo Rehabilitation Act of 1950 does modify

18

IMLA.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

With respect to that Expired -

I'm sorry?
-- the opinion in the

23

last time around not only contained the statement that I

24

read before, that is, any relevant statute, but in the

25

very beginning it says, "We hold the tribe's claim for
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

compensation from the federal government failed," and

2

there is a well known distinction between a claim at

3

issue and attributing to the Court that kind of

4

carelessness for saying that the claim is barred as

5

distinguished from an issue, the issue being IMLA.

6

think the Court was conscious of that distinction when

7

it used the word that the claim failed, not just the

8

issue.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

I

Obviously, Justice Ginsburg,

10

you are in a much better position to judge what was

11

intended here.

12

the Court generally is that when you analyze a case,

13

that you analyze it in terms of the specific question

14

that is presented, and if you are posing to go beyond

15

the question presented, you say so expressly, not simply

16

by the use of the word "claim" or "argument."

17

On the other hand, my experience with

So while I recognize that the Court -- that

18

the government has an argument to be made that has

19

pre-decided that, I think, frankly, one, the Court

20

didn't decide this issue; and two, the Court should

21

decide the question that was presented here as to the

22

scope of section 5, because it's obviously of

23

extraordinary importance to not only section 5 but also

24

to section 8 as well.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Phillips, the

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government says that by the time this lease was

2

executed, the Rehabilitation Act was a dead letter.

3

That it was meant to stimulate economic activity on the

4

Navajo reservation, and there were funds appropriated

5

for that purpose and that all had been played out by the

6

time this lease was entered into.

7

Is there something wrong with that?

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

about that.

Yeah, the government's wrong

I believe -- the program itself is for the

10

overall rehabilitation of the Navajo and the Hopi.

11

There are a series of projects that the -- where the

12

statute says such programs shall include the following

13

projects.

14

projects, and those projects have been set out over

15

time.

16

It doesn't say it's limited to the following

But the program itself is not limited that

17

way and more fundamentally, it is completely

18

inconsistent with that kind of time limitation on the

19

statute overall.

20

sections of this act, sections 9 and 10 after the

21

10-year period that expired if the statute didn't have

22

any continuing implication.

23

Congress would have repealed certain

It also would have meant that the leasing

24

protections in section 5 had expired after 10 years,

25

which seems to me quite inconsistent with the overall
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

purpose here to accomplish that.

2

temporal argument doesn't get the government

3

particularly far.

4

So I think the

I would like to take a second to talk about

5

sort what I think is an important distinction between

6

635 and other provisions, which is that 634(a) imposes a

7

duty that the Secretary's brief, I think, evidently sets

8

out, that duty means that you have to make sure there is

9

fair market value, that those are reasonable rates, and

10

that was not done.

11

place.

12

So that's the violation that took

Then the question is, is there a

13

money-generating, money-mandating obligation imposed

14

here.

15

635(a), which said nothing about liability, and 635(b)

16

and (c), which expressly -- expressly excludes the

17

possibility of liability, suggests clearly why 635(a)

18

ought to be viewed by this Court as a sufficient -- as

19

creating a fair inference, is what the Court said in

20

Mitchell two, a fair inference under these particular

21

circumstances.

22

And there it seems to be the distinction between

The other issue that we have put on the

23

table that the government didn't actually address in its

24

opening, although I have to suspect -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you are saying that

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

635(a) creates an inference that 635(c) creates a

2

fiduciary duty?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, 635(a) creates the

4

fiduciary duties.

5

(c) demonstrates that that duty is a money-mandating or

6

rights-creating duty that's enforceable under the Indian

7

Tucker Act, Justice Breyer.

8
9

The juxtaposition of (a) to (b) and

The other duty, it seems to me, that the
Secretary breached there is the duty embedded in section

10

8 of this statute, which requires him to make

11

disclosures as part of this program.

12

that is absolutely clear that the Court of Federal

13

Claims -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the one thing

That's the part that I'm

15

not getting. You are saying -- the question, I guess,

16

basically is, does the language of 635(a) that says with

17

the approval of the Secretary, the Indians can, among

18

other things, for business purposes lease the land.

19

Right?

That's what it says?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then -

And that doesn't seem much

22

different from the IMLA, to tell you the truth, to me.

23

It doesn't seem different at all.

24

saying, no, it's really different because look at (b)

25

and (c), that's your basic argument?

But now you are

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I look at (b) and (c) and

3

it says -- when you lease something under (b) and (c)

4

which is not (a) -- (b) and (c) -- you have to have this

5

all supervision, and so forth, or it has to be at a fair

6

value, something like that; is that right?

7
8

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it doesn't -- it

doesn't -

9

JUSTICE BREYER: (B) and (c) say that land is

10

owned in fee but, let's see -- what is -- sorry, I don't

11

want to delay you on this.

12

you were saying, create an obligation -- create more of

13

a trust obligation.

14

I thought that (b) and (c),

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, just to read (b) which

15

unfortunately isn't reproduced I don't think in any of

16

the papers, but it says notwithstanding any other

17

provision of law, land owned in fee simple by the Navajo

18

may be leased, sold or otherwise disposed of by the sole

19

authority of the tribal council in any manner that a

20

similar land in this State is situated may be leased,

21

sold or otherwise disposed of by other private land

22

owners, and the -- such disposition shall create no

23

liability on the part of the United States.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

So why does that -- why

does that mean that this Act creates a trust
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

relationship?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, that -- the -- the trust

3

relationship doesn't come out of the PNC; the money

4

creating component of it, it seems to me comes, out of

5

PNC.

6

the entirety of the statute was enacted to implement the

7

treaties, that these are all lands that are held in

8

trust, and that -- and that there is a specific duty

9

embedded in (a) that requires that the Secretary approve

The trust relationship comes from the fact that

10

what is otherwise basically controlled as a trust

11

arrangement, and that is implemented through regulations

12

that require the Secretary to do this under a fair

13

market value standard.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, give me an -- an

15

instance in the statute that is in opposition brief of

16

the orange brief at page 5.

17

the last clause "and such disposition shall create no

18

liability on the part of the United States," what

19

contingency was that directed to if not the one that is

20

before us?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Give me an example of why

Well, that's for the sale of

22

fee simple lands, so you are dealing with a very

23

different set of -- of circumstances.

24

about -- it's aimed clearly at a different set of

25

properties that were being held and therefore they said,
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Which is talking

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

when you engage in leases for that kind of property,

2

there is no liability.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But your -- your argument

4

is that simply because there isn't that kind of an

5

exclusion in (a), there must have been an intent to

6

permit liability.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

A fair inference, I think is

8

all I have to demonstrate -

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Thank you, but now what of

10

course is at the back of my mind is I'm trying to see,

11

if this -- is this statute stronger for you than the

12

statute we already considered?

13

suspicion, because I think if it is a stronger statute

14

for you, you would have argued it the last time.

15

wonder why you didn't.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I start with some

So I

I wasn't here then.
So somebody thought maybe

18

it was a weaker statute, so -- but I will put that

19

suspicion aside.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Can I ask you -

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

So anyhow that's the

22

fundamental question in my mind.

23

and so forth, but the language doesn't seem any stronger

24

for you, at least at first blush.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

I look at the language

There's two -- there

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are two answers; I was being facetious as to why we

2

didn't push this argument the last time.

3

because the Federal Circuit concluded the last time

4

based on IMLA alone that there was in fact a sufficient

5

right-creating provision.

6

It was largely

And therefore we depended -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So did you, Mr. Phillips.

7

Last time around you acknowledged that the Peabody lease

8

was governed only by IMLA.

9

from your brief last time around.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

That -- those words were

I don't know if those were

11

from the brief.

12

undisputed facts in the first round of litigation.

13

there is no question in the Court -- if we are right,

14

that the Court remanded to -- from consideration

15

consistent with this.

16

from the Federal Circuit; we took additional discovery;

17

and we obtained the information that we got.

18

remember, the United States' brief in the Ninth Circuit

I know there was a statement of

25

MR. PHILLIPS:
there's no question.

And also,

That was an overstatement,

Based on what we knew at the time,

we thought it was in fact an IMLA lease, but in truth -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In -- IMLA -

-- is it's not IMLA, anyway.
But it is the statute

5

that seems most closely on point, because it's the only

6

one that talks about mineral leases exclusively.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, but this is the only one

8

that deals specifically with the Navajo Reservation and

9

deals with leasing for business purposes for the

10

development of resources.

And so while I -- I agree

11

with you in one sense, the other one has a -- some

12

superficial closeness here.

13

closer one is actually the provision that deals with

14

this specific reservation and this specific type of a

15

lease arrangement.

It seems to me that the

that might induce him to say that.

That's very strange to me.

understand that, but the -- the bottom line here is, the

5

question is, is this, you know -- is it absolutely clear

6

that this is exclusively an IMLA lease?

7

to that is there is a lot of evidence that suggests no.

8

It's not in the form of IMLA; there are a lot from other

statements that say yes, and more fundamentally it seems

to me is the Court should not view it as an either/or

13

It could be adopted under IMLA or it could
So the section 8 argument -

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought that your argument

14

earlier was that all leases of mineral rights on the

15

Navajo-Hopi land are governed by the Rehabilitation Act,

16

and it's not a factual question as to which statute

17

anybody chose at the time of the negotiation of the

18

lease.

19

to be arguing that it was a factual issue that was -

20

that was unearthed only through later discovery.

21

But recently, in the last few minutes, you seem

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't know that it's

22

a factual question; it is that candidly, we obviously

23

focused more on IMLA because the Federal Circuit -

24

first of all, the Court of Federal Claims in the first

25

go-around adopted IMLA as the test and just said you
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lose because you don't have an IMLA lease here; and we

2

had argued here that it's not just an IMLA lease.

3

we went to the Federal Circuit and we won on the grounds

4

that it was an IMLA controlled error and we should

5

prevail on that basis.

6

we obviously didn't have IMLA available, since the

7

Federal Circuit specifically precluded us from any

8

further reliance on IMLA, we looked at the other

9

provisions; we tried to understand their context, and

Then

When it was sent back down and

10

then that -- all I'm trying to do is explain why it is

11

that we would suddenly focus more on the Navajo act, not

12

to say that you couldn't read the statute and say it

13

would necessarily apply in that circumstance.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That isn't really my

15

question, because I've tried to erase from my mind any

16

suspicion about why you did or didn't argue it last

17

time; and looking at it straight afresh, I think when

18

the Court of Claims got this back, as any judge would,

19

the first thing they do is look at the words of the old

20

statute, look at the words of the new statute, and try

21

to figure out if the new statute that you cited is

22

somehow more supportive of your claim than the old one

23

was.

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

42
Alderson Reporting Company

So what have we got

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

here in that respect?

2

provisions that say the government shall have no

3

liability when it enters into leases.

4

that helps you, but at the moment, I am slightly

5

escaping it.

6

were promulgated after the lease was entered into and

7

seem on their face to deal with other matters.

8

now, what am I missing?

9
10
11

What we seem to have is two later

And then I guess there is some regs that

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm not sure I understand the

JUSTICE BREYER:
emphasize, so forget them.

13

them we won't.

15

Well the regs you didn't
If you don't want to rely on

could find that would support you on this basis -

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

want to you add something to explain -

19

Okay,

last part about -

12

14

I mean, maybe

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.
-- and there you are, so I

Well, I would go back to

20

Justice Alito's first question that was posed to Mr.

21

Kneedler, which was is this provision has a duty -

22

because it has an approval requirement; and the answer

23

is yes, this Court in Navajo I looked further at IMLA,

24

at that specific statute, and concluded that that

25

statute overall had a very significant limitation
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

embedded in that duty; and the question is, is there

2

anything in the Rehabilitation Act that has that same

3

limitation?

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Okay.
And my answer to that is no,

6

there is nothing in it; and contrary to the overall

7

intent of IMLA, which was to guarantee self-sufficiency,

8

the overall intent of this statute was to allow the

9

Navajo to come somewhere in the area of those standards.

10

In addition to that, I do think there are regulations

11

that do require the Secretary to invoke a fair market

12

value assessment of the rates that are embedded in this

13

lease, and that he did not -- he clearly did not do

14

that.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even if you are

16

right about the duty-creating aspect, what -- talk a

17

little about the money-mandating aspect, the second

18

stage of the analysis under Navajo I.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I think the key to

20

that is -- is sort of two-fold.

One, I think when you

21

-- in the absence of some clear statement in this

22

statute akin to the one that existed in IMLA, that

23

reduces the duty of the United States, that the Court

24

ought to then simply examine this against the background

25

of the trust principles and say you have a duty; you
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ought to exercise your duty consistent with your role as

2

a trustee; and you ought to -- you ought to be acting in

3

the best interests of the Navajo Nation.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Before we find a

5

waiver of sovereign immunity opening up the Treasury of

6

the United States, we usually insist on something a

7

little more specific than general trust principles.

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

And then the second -- I

mean, if you are not prepared to accept the general

10

trust principles, although, again, they go through the

11

context of a specific imposed duty that -- that 635(a)

12

has in the first instance.

13

beyond that, then I go to 635(b) and (c), where Congress

14

clearly seems to have in mind the possibility of not

15

having liability imposed in certain circumstances and

16

yet left 635(a) there without a similar protection for

17

the United States, which, again, may not be the

18

compelled inference, but it certainly seems to me to

19

create a fair inference.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

the Secretary reads 635.

22

deference?

23

But even if you want to go

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that's not how

Isn't he entitled to Chevron

Well, unless you are saying

24

that -- I don't know what context Mr. Chief Justice was

25

talking about.

Official - Subject to Final Review

want to read it that way because they are in litigation

2

right now.

3

scheme or in the regulatory scheme that would say that.

4

And certainly, if you go back and look at the

5

Secretary's brief, in their analysis of the regulatory

6

scheme, the -- let me see if I can find this -- page 25

7

to 26, where they point out that there was a gap where

8

-- where the Secretary did not exclude mineral leasing

9

from the 635 -

think about this?

Scalia.

(Laughter.)

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

I'll just conclude with the section (a)

It's not in the brief.

17

argument, which is to recognize that the Secretary did

18

owe a duty of candor and disclosure embedded in section

19

(a).

20

responsibility did not end.

21

for that breach of duty is a question that obviously is

22

still open on remand.

23

can behave the way the Secretary did in this case, which

24

is to know that he was not going to take personal

25

jurisdiction over the final decision, command that no

That program did not end.

That disclosure

What the measure of damages

But the notion that the Secretary

2

distress under those circumstances, force them to

3

negotiate with one hand tied behind their back at a

4

minimum, and then handed up an agreement that was half

5

what the fair market value would have been for the

6

quality of coal is an outrage, and the Court ought to

7

allow the damages action to go forward.

If there are no further questions, I urge
the Court to affirm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

GEN. KNEEDLER:

First, Mr. Chief Justice,

17

with respect to the text of section 5, it doesn't -- it

18

doesn't by any means suggest that it covers mineral

19

leases.

20

tribe or members of the tribe "may lease" -- "with the

21

approval of the Secretary, may lease for various

22

religious, recreational, or business purposes, including

23

the development" of utilization -- "or utilization of

24

natural resources in connection with the operations

25

under those leases." It's not a free-standing mineral

The pertinent phrase is that they -- that the

lease or resource lease provision.

2

and "in connection with operations under such leases,"

3

referring back to business leases or the other things

4

there.

5

covers mineral leases.

So I think, on its face, it doesn't suggest it

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

GEN. KNEEDLER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It says, "including"

Well, that But But it says "the

development or utilization of natural resources."

"In connection with

a recitation of things that don't include mineral

13

leases.

It's educational, recreational, and business

14

leases.

And as we explained, there are specific -

15

And -- and what's above,

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

GEN. KNEEDLER:

No, it says "public."
"For public, religious" -

22

"public" would be like for a school, if a State was

23

going to put a school on or something, but -- but the -

24

but as we explain in our brief, there was a specific

25

reason why Congress enacted this.

There was a gap in

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the authority to lease for these types of purposes at

2

the time this was enacted.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

And why didn't Well, even if -- if I may

have just one minute, Justice Souter.

6

If you get revenue from the natural

7

resources, why isn't that a public, religious,

8

educational purpose?

9
10

They get revenue from leasing.

GEN. KNEEDLER:

The -- the example would be

--

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

give too cramped a reading to section 5.

13

GEN. KNEEDLER:

I just -- I just think you

Well, the example would be,

14

if you -- for example, if you were going to use water -

15

this is a Navajo reservation -- if you needed water for

16

a business and sink a well, you would be utilizing or

17

developing the natural resources in connection with a

18

surface lease.

19

last sentence of section 5 says, "Nothing in this

20

section shall be construed to repeal or affect the

21

authority under other provisions."

provision that is IMLA.

But -- but the last section of -- the

GEN. KNEEDLER:

I -- I suppose they could,

4
5

Well -

I -

6

but in -- in the terminology, mineral leasing, as we

7

explain in our brief -- that the categories of leasing

8

that are -- have always been handled differently.

9

"Mineral leasing" is the term that is used for minerals.

10

Business, grazing, farming -- we explain this in our

11

brief, that those are different.

12

were utilized to implement section 5 had never included

13

specific provisions for mineral leases.

14

always been under other -- other provisions.

The regulations that

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

address the scope of business purposes?

17

GEN. KNEEDLER:

They have

Do the regs specifically

They -- they -- not beyond

18

basically repeating them, but the -- but they, for

19

example, talk about rental value, which is not the way

20

you describe mineral leases, which are -- which are

21

royalties, not rental value.

22

If I could also address the argument about

23

sections (b) and (c), sections (b) and (c) of this Act

24

provide -- first of all, were enacted after section (a),

25

so I don't think much of an inference could be drawn.

But there are situations -- special types of conveyances

that it was -- that it was transferring.

no reason to think the United States should be liable

for that, for what it did with the tribe did with its

own fee land, and Congress wanted to make sure of that.

Alderson Reporting Company

this Court pointed out in the Cotton Petroleum and

bring uniformity to mineral leasing.

that Congress would have implicitly wanted to

specifically carve the Navajo and Hopi out of that

regulations and cover it by -- by a provision like this

11

I also just wanted to come back to this idea

12

of -- of imposing liability on the basis of the common

13

law, because the example of what the Federal Circuit did

14

in this case, with all respect to that court, we think

15

strayed so far from what this Court laid down in Navajo

it disposed of this case before, to make clear that

I think that's not

at all correct.

With respect to the approval of the

21

lease terms in 1987 -- under a provision that provided

22

for "reasonable" lease adjustments, the Secretary

23

approved leases negotiated by the tribe at 12.5 percent.

24

The tribe entered into two other leases at the very same

25

time, although not the subject of this case, for 12.5
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

percent.

That's the standard royalty rate.

And the

2

tribe got other benefits from this as a package.

3

respect to the arguments about what the Secretary did on

4

-- on appeal, it's even clearer that all this

5

information about the Secretary meeting with Peabody's

6

lobbyist, it was before the Court before, and the Court

7

found no violation of any statute or regulation.

8

it's even clearer on remand, as we point out on page 22

9

of our reply brief, that the tribe was fully aware that

With

But

10

the Secretary was not going to -- had -- had said the

11

appeal was not going to be acted on and had sent the

parties back to negotiations.
