ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12
13
14

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In section 233(a), Congress extended an

15

absolute immunity to officers and employees of the

16

Public Health Service.

17

Congress's policy judgment that the immunity was

18

necessary to revitalize the Public Health Service, makes

19

a claim against the United States under the Federal Tort

20

Claims Act the exclusive remedy for injury or death

21

resulting from the performance of medical or related

22

functions and precludes any other civil action or

23

proceeding against the individuals by reason of the same

24

subject matter.

25

That provision, reflecting

Without grappling with the language of
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

section 233(a), Respondents have tried in a number of

2

different ways to imply a limitation into the test for

3

constitutional claims, but none of those arguments

4

creates any ambiguity in the statute, for three reasons.

5

First, the Bivens exception, found in the

6

Westfall Act itself, applies only to the immunity set

7

forth in the Westfall Act and says nothing about the

8

scope of the entirely separate and distinct immunity set

9

forth in section 233.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What are the immunities

11

set forth in the Westfall Act?

12

were -- they applied to all Federal employees?

MS. GOLDENBERG:

I thought that they

Yes, Your Honor, that's

correct.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Including the Public

Health Service.
MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes, that's correct.

18

Public Health Service employees can take advantage both

19

of the immunities set forth in the Westfall Act and also

20

of the separate, preexisting, more specific immunity that's

21

afforded to them by section 233(a).

22

And this Court's decision in Smith, I think,

23

made clear that those two immunities can coexist.

24

no conflict between them.

25

Smith is that the Westfall Act immunity adds to the

There's

prior immunity, and employees can take advantage of both

2

of them.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, our job is to

4

determine Congress's intent when it passed 233(a).

5

we do know is that there was no Bivens immunity at the

6

time; the FTCA had only a limited application under

7

certain driver-related accidents.

8

have anything to tell us, because they didn't even know

9

that there was a constitutional claim that could be

10
11

What

So we really don't

raised, what they would have intended or not intended.
And I thought that Justice Ginsburg's point

12

would be that the Westfall Act tells us what they

13

intended, because by its nature it applied to all

14

employees and didn't differentiate among them, and

15

copied 233's immunity, so that one can look at it and

16

say, ah, that speaks of Congress's intent.

17

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, certainly it's true

18

that when Congress enacted the Westfall Act it could

19

have broadly said, for instance, notwithstanding any

20

other provision of law, no Federal employee shall assert

21

a statutory immunity to constitutional claims.

22

didn't do that.

23

that, which is that what it said was in section

24

2679(b)(2), paragraph (1) -- the immunity for Federal

25

employees that was just set forth shall not apply to

But it

It did something much more narrow than

5

constitutional claims.

3

And that's --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

besides 233(a) that is similar --

Is there any other Act

7

Yes.
-- that gives separate

Which are those?
MS. GOLDENBERG:

There are a number of them,

8

Your Honor.

Most of them apply to Federal medical

9

workers, although not all of them.

There is 10 U.S.C.

10

section 1089, the Gonzalez Act, which is discussed in

11

our brief and in the government's brief, which applies

12

to Army doctors.

13

doctors, to Veterans Administration doctors, to certain

14

medical volunteers.

15

There are statutes applying to NASA

So there are a number of these statutes

16

passed over a period of several decades.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in --

But it seems to me that,

18

quite apart from the Westfall Act, there's a more --

19

more basic answer that you would make to Justice

20

Sotomayor's question.

21

of immunity clauses are to make the employees secure

22

against unforeseen causes of action as well as foreseen.

23

I think that's a principled answer you could make.

25

And that is, because the nature

And I

think the problem with the interpretation that makes the

interpretation of the statute depend on the timing of

25

the Bivens decision is pointed up by two different
7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

statutory provisions and the odd results that you would

2

have.

3

One is that the Gonzalez Act, which I

4

referred to earlier -- it's 10 U.S.C. section 1089 --

5

was enacted in 1976, it has immunity-conferring language

6

that's extremely similar to the immunity-conferring

7

language of section 233(a).

8

Congress enacted the Gonzalez Act, it looked at and

9

thought about section 233(a), and yet if it mattered

In fact, we know that when

10

whether Bivens had yet been decided, the Gonzalez Act

11

would bar Bivens claims, but 233(a) wouldn't, even though

12

you can't make that kind of distinction based on their text.

MS. GOLDENBERG:

The text says what it

Yes, Your Honor, I agree.

20

And the text here is very broad and very clear that it's

21

any other civil action or proceeding that --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what it says.

23

MS. GOLDENBERG:

-- that results from the same

24

subject matter.

And I think one thing that's important

25

is that "subject matter" here clearly means the same set
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of facts or the same set of circumstances.

2

So that, it -- it's not the case that you

3

only get immunity where your cause of action is somehow

4

similar to the cause of action you have under the FTCA.

5

If you -- you get immunity if you have any claim against

6

the individuals that comes out of the -- the same set of

7

facts, even if it were true that there was some

8

requirement of an FTCA remedy, which we don't believe

9

there is.

And that's a -- there's

22

a ceiling, because the Tort Claims Act refers to the law

of the place where the act or omission occurred.

MS. GOLDENBERG:

California law is what's been discussed in the briefs.

2

I understand that it's possible that Respondents might

where some of the decisions were made about the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But California law is
That's true.

Which would put a lid

on the damages, since this is a death case, of 250,000?

10

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Not exactly, Your Honor.

11

There is no limit whatsoever on the economic damages in

12

a case arising out of professional negligence.

13

under California law, a $250,000 cap on noneconomic

14

damages.

15

in this case, where Respondents have argued intentional

16

wrongdoing by the United States, for which they can

17

recover under the FTCA, if they can prove that something

18

more than negligence was at issue, then it's possible

19

under California law, although California law is not

20

entirely clear, that they could actually exceed that

21

$250,000 cap for noneconomic damages.

There is,

As we have said in our briefs, we think that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you to comment

23

why the defense wasn't raised in the case.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, not necessarily,

6

because there may be factual issues that -- that we're

7

not now aware of.

8

9

the complaint, that when that particular individual took

In other words, it may be that the

10

the acts complained of, he wasn't somehow wearing his

11

PHS hat, he was operating in some other capacity.

12

but that's obviously just speculation.

13

So --

And it's -- it is not clear why that defense

14

wasn't raised.

15

and, not only that, but in the court of appeals and in

16

this Court, there is no reference made to the fact that he's

17

in the Public Health Service.

18

What is clear is that it was not raised

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now, that's kind of

19

interesting that apparently the government was not

20

aware of the breadth of the position they're --

21

you're now taking.

22

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I'm not sure that's

23

necessarily the conclusion I would draw.

24

there may be factual reasons why it wasn't raised.

25

There may be strategic reasons why it wasn't raised.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

As I say,

Official

1

It's hard to speculate on that so long after the --

2

after the fact.

3

But what is clear from Carlson is that the

4

way that section 233(a) did arise in that case is that

5

the Court used it as a specific example to contrast with

6

the FTCA itself, and said that section 233 was a place

7

where Congress had made known explicitly its intent that

8

the FTCA be the exclusive remedy and that other remedies

9

be precluded.

10

That's the way that 233(a) was argued in

11

the briefs in that case, and that's how the Court used

12

it.

13

Petitioners' plea for immunity here.

14

And that's obviously extremely supportive of the

This Court has already essentially

15

recognized in Carlson, in reasoning in support of its

16

holding, that that is the role that 233(a) plays, and the

17

Court must have been talking about barring Bivens claims

18

because that's what Carlson was about.

19

significance of 233(a) in that case.

20

So that's the

The Respondents also -- on a subject we

21

haven't touched on yet, I think, look at the title of

22

section 233(a) and some of its other subsections, and

23

there I think it's clear that the title can't vary the

24

clear statutory text in any way.

25

relevant here, it talks about negligence and

Even if the title were

2

18 to 19, the authorities showing that when the statute

3

was enacted in 1970, malpractice was thought to sweep

4

very broadly to cover any bad acts, any malpractice, and

5

so it doesn't operate -- the title here can't operate as

6

a limitation on the scope of this provision.

7

And we've cited in our reply brief, at pages

With respect to the history, the one

8

other thing that I wanted to point out that I didn't get

9

to in my answer before is another odd result that you

10

would have, if you looked at when Bivens was decided and

11

made that your deciding factor, is that the FTCA's

12

judgment bar, at 28 U.S.C. section 2676, which was enacted

13

in 1948, which says that when you take a claim against

14

the United States under the FTCA all the way to judgment,

15

you are barred from raising any other civil action or

16

proceeding by reason of the same subject matter.

17

very similar language to what we have here.

18

wouldn't bar Bivens claims, even though every court of

19

appeals to have looked at the issue has said that it

20

does cover Bivens claims in a different sense.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So

That

Well, that would bar a

22

later Bivens claim.

I assume you could bring a Bivens

23

action first, and the bar provision would not apply,

24

assuming you can bring the Bivens claim.

25

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Yes, I think that's right.

13
Alderson Reporting Company

But the -- all I'm trying to say is that it's the "any

5

the judgment bar.

6

been decided yet, it wouldn't cover Bivens because the

7

statute was enacted prior to the time that Bivens was

8

decided.

9

If you looked at whether Bivens had

So it's not -- it doesn't make sense to make

10

your statutory interpretation, your interpretation of

11

those words, hinge on the fact that Bivens had or hadn't

12

been decided yet.

If there are no further questions, I'd

incredibly broad language that Congress used to show --

Now, what we do know is that Congress

enacted this special protection for Public Health

Service personnel and singled them out at the Surgeon

General's request in 1970.

3

to remember, in 1970 -- this is pre-Westfall Act -- it was

4

not at all clear that Federal medical personnel were

5

immune even from common law negligence, for example.

6

And I think it's important

And so even from that point, putting Bivens

7

liability aside, Congress chose to accord special

8

protection to PHS personnel above and beyond that

entitled to those who they were working with side by

greater immunity to Public Health Service employees.
MR. SHAH:

21

Justice Scalia, I completely

22

agree.

I think it's correct that the important fact is

23

the fact that Congress accorded them special protection.

24

Again, this was -- this was at the request, the specific

25

request of the Surgeon General, and they did this to

Now, I don't think that it's -- that the

6

the armed forces.

7

officers can be assigned to very difficult situations

8

Like DOD medical personnel, PHS

medical conditions.

11

In the Gonzalez Act legislative history,

12

Congress says that that was a reason -- an additional

13

reason as to why they wanted to accord immunity.

14

think PHS personnel are similarly situated.

15

Court were looking for a reason, the fact is they were

16

accorded the same immunity, and that's the dispositive

17

factor.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I

If this

Just as a matter of

19

curiosity, do all of these immunity provisions come out

20

of the same committee?

21

Public Health Service may have come out of one committee

22

of Congress, the Bureau of Prisons may have come out of

23

another committee of Congress, the DOD may have come out

24

of a third committee of Congress?

25

MR. SHAH:

Or can one assume that the

I don't know if they all

came out of the same committee, but these certainly span

2

a wide spectrum of years, all the way from the 1960s

3

to -- to the late 1970s, in terms of when these various

4

immunity provisions were enacted.

5

at the same time, like, I believe, the provision for NASA

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Some of them happened

If section 2679(b)(2),

instead of saying paragraph (1) does not extend nor

10

apply, had said the remedy against the United States

11

provided by sections 1346(b), et cetera, and repeated

12

that language from (b)(1), and then said:

13

exclusive remedy in any civil action against an employee

14

of the government," and continued with subsection (2),

15

then the result here would be different, wouldn't it?

16

MR. SHAH:

"Is not the

Your Honor, it may be a closer

17

case but I don't think that the result would be

18

different, and here's why:

19

233(a) -- and this is on the very last page of the -- of

20

the government's brief -- it does refer to the FTCA in

21

terms of the remedy that a -- that a plaintiff should

22

seek, but it's not -- it does not look to the FTCA to

23

make that remedy exclusive.

If you look at the text of

25

independent of the FTCA, to make the remedy exclusive.

It says, "The remedy against the United States" under the

2

FTCA -- that's what it references -- "for damage for

3

personal injury including death resulting from" medical

4

performance -- and then it has its own language -- "shall be

5

exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by

6

7

reference the FTCA in that latter clause, and it's that

8

latter clause that makes the remedy exclusive.

It does not

So, regardless of the language of the

10

Westfall Act, I think -- I don't think it would make a

11

difference to the result if Congress had used the

12

wording that you suggest, Justice Alito.

13

The one -- the one final point I'd like

14

to make is I think it bears emphasizing that this is not

15

a case where there is no other relief than a Bivens

remedy available.

Thank

MR. DOYLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Section 233 does not bar Bivens claims here

22

for two principal reasons.

First, 233 does not abrogate

a constitutional cause of action because it cannot

satisfy Carlson's explicit declaration test, which is a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, that's quite a surprising

2

statement for you to make, when the very first statute

3

that Carlson mentions is 233(a).
MR. DOYLE:

4
5

Your Honor, I believe you're

referring to the dicta in Carlson on page 20.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

7

MR. DOYLE:

8

to note how that issue was raised.

9

raised arguing that 233(a) bars Bivens claims; the government

And it's interesting
In the briefs, it wasn't

10

didn't make that argument.

11

the Respondents' cert petition or brief in opposition for

12

the proposition that -- that the language of that

13

statute actually allowed a Bivens claim because it

14

didn't preclude it.

15

government actually argued that because Bivens hadn't

16

been decided in -- in 1970, that it could not have

17

possibly preserved Bivens claims.

18

the opposite issue that was -- that was addressed in

19

Carlson --

20

And, in fact, it was raised in

And in -- in response the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it was actually

Well, it certainly

21

doesn't get that out of the way.

It's put on page 20,

22

because one of the reasons why Carlson enables ­ allows the Bivens Act

23

is that it doesn't contain language and the -- and it --

24

it seems to me that this -- that this paragraph is

25

contrasting statutes with Carlson, because in Carlson

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there is no -- there is no other statute.

2

MR. DOYLE:

Justice Ginsburg, if I may

3

reply, I believe that that's not the proper way to read

4

that dicta for two reasons.

5

Stevens mentioned the Assistant Surgeon General of the

6

United States was actually a defendant in the case, and

7

so although this 233(a) immunity wasn't -- wasn't

8

decided in Carlson, certainly the Court was aware that a

9

-- that a Public Health Service defendant was in the

First, I think Justice

10

case, and they wouldn't have permitted an action to move

11

forward against that defendant had they believed that

12

233 barred Bivens.

13

And, second, it -- it specially characterizes

14

the explicit declaration as applying to malpractice, not

15

Bivens claims.

16

statute in the category there was the Federal Drivers

17

Act, and certainly it's hard to imagine how a Federal

18

driver could be liable under -- under Bivens.

And other -- for example, another

And so I think a better reading of that

19
20

dicta is that the Court is just saying:

Here's an

21

example; these statutes show that when Congress makes an

22

explicit declaration, but the issue is explicit as to

23

what?

24

based on the existence of the Surgeon General in the

25

case and the fact that the dicta was qualified, that it

And it's clear I think from reading that dicta

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

didn't apply to Bivens.

2

But moving back to the Carlson test, 233

3

can't satisfy the test because Carlson never even -- or

4

Congress never considered whether the FTCA was a

5

substitute for Bivens in 1970.

6

underscored by the fact that the statute was enacted

7

before Bivens and that the cause of action at issue here

8

wasn't recognized until 10 years later in Carlson.

9

And, second, when Congress did finally

And this point is

10

consider for the first time whether the FTCA was an

11

adequate substitute for Bivens in 1988, it expressly

12

preserved, rather than barred, Bivens claims in the

13

Westfall Act.

14

And the Westfall Act was a comprehensive

15

statute that was intended to provide an overhaul of

16

personal immunity at the request of this Court in

17

Westfall v. Erwin, and it applied to all Federal

18

employees, including members of the Public Health

19

Service.

20

Smith.

21

And that was the holding of this Court in

And Petitioners' reading here would actually

22

require this Court to write in an implied exception to

23

the Westfall Act that doesn't exist, that would exempt

24

out Public Health Service personnel from the explicit

25

carve-out of Bivens.

Moreover, the Petitioners' reading

12

our reading, there would be no -- it wouldn't really do

13

any more work for Public Health Service employees,

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't understand your

8

understanding is, many years ago, Congress passes a

Give absolute immunity from Bivens

actions. Sue the government;

11

It says that, basically.

12

My

10

MR. DOYLE:

11

Okay.
I understand that one.

12

The one I don't understand is what's the relation of the

13

Westfall Act to this argument?

14

MR. DOYLE:

There's -- there's two

15

relationships between the Westfall Act and the Public

16

Health Service Act.

17

applies on its face to all government employees.

First, the Westfall Act simply

19

Yes, right.

This

They give the

20

government employees the same kind of immunity that -- a

little more limited, and that's in paragraph (1).

hesitation is it has nothing to do with the case; it's

5

the Carlson thing that is the important thing.

6

tell me why I'm wrong.

MR. DOYLE:

Now, you

Justice Breyer, if I could

8

answer.

This Court, in Smith, held that the immunity

9

conferred by section (1) applies to all Federal employees.

10

And you have to read (1) and (2) together.

11

divorce them, because section (1) grants immunity, but

12

subsection (2) affects it and -- and helps define it by

13

saying that -JUSTICE BREYER:

23

And when you go to the -JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. DOYLE:

It is.

5

Oh, it is the -- in other

6

words, you think -- I thought the FTCA Act is an Act

7

that gives you action against the government.
MR. DOYLE:

8
9

The Westfall Act is just simply

an amendment to the FTCA.
JUSTICE BREYER:

10

So it says:

This Act is

11

the exclusive remedy -- the FTCA is an exclusive remedy

12

for all employees, but this provision which gives us an

13

exception does not give you the exception, does not make

14

it exclusive for Bivens actions.
Okay.

15
16

You go ahead.

You explain it to me.

I don't want to keep repeating my skepticism, I want to listen.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. DOYLE:

Okay.

Well, the first clause

19

of section 233(a) states that -- that the remedy against

20

the United States provided by 1346(b) is remedy

21

available.

22

defined the 1346(b) -- I believe it's on page 5a of the --

23

of our appendix -- and says that -- that the remedy is

24

subject to the entire provisions of the FTCA.

25

have to look to the entire provisions of the FTCA

And so you go to 1346(b), and Congress

And so you

to determine what the remedy is, because --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what says "entire

6

that you have to overcome.

7

substitute remedy against the United States under the

8

Federal Tort Claims Act, and the employee is immune from

9

any civil action.

That's -- those are the words I think

Plaintiff has a

action doesn't include Bivens actions.

17

MR. DOYLE:

It amended 233(a) --

-- effect, because it's

18

incorporated by reference through the Act.

19

the first sentence says "subject to the provisions of

20

chapter 171," which is the entire FTCA.

21

chapter, there's a provision entitled "Exclusiveness of

22

Remedy."

23

the precise issue before the Court, whether the FTCA is

24

the exclusive remedy here for a Bivens action.

25

specifically says in that section that Bivens actions

So 1346(b),

And within that

And that defines -- and that really addresses

34
Alderson Reporting Company

And it

1

are excluded.

2

And so if you want to find out what remedy

3

is available to a prospective plaintiff, you have to

4

look at how Congress defined the remedy, and it

5

specifically defined it by limiting it under its

6

Exclusiveness Clause to common law torts, not Bivens

7

claims.

8
9

But I think one of the key principles here
that we have to acknowledge is that you defer -- the

10

Court defers to Congress in policy considerations like

11

this because presumably Congress is in a better position

12

than the Court to -- to weigh policy decisions like

13

providing immunity to certain government employees.

14

the deference there is only appropriate where Congress

15

has actually faced the issue and balanced the policy

16

considerations.

17

because Bivens hadn't been decided; Estelle v. Gamble

18

hadn't been decided until 1976, which -- which

19

established the deliberate indifference standard; and

20

then Carlson wasn't decided until 1980.

21

Congress, for the first time, actually looked at the

22

issue --

23

But

And it could not have done so in 1970,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And when

Well, you say any -- any

24

other civil action that -- that did not exist prior to

25

the enactment of 233(a) would not be covered by its
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exclusion because Congress couldn't have known that this

2

civil action existed, so that it only covered those

3

causes of action that existed at the time the statute

4

was passed?

5

MR. DOYLE:

Only -- only as to

6

constitutional causes of action, Justice Scalia.

7

And I think --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why?

Why?

I mean, if your

theory is it doesn't preclude anything they didn't know

10

about, if they didn't know about something, whether it's

11

constitutional or not, what -- what reason is there to

12

say it's precluded?

13

MR. DOYLE:

Well, I think that the issue

14

here is, is that when Congress is going to -- was going

15

to abrogate a constitutional right or recognize a

16

constitutional remedy, it has to do so in a clear way.

17

And in, for example, Webster v. Doe or, in effect, the

18

Blatchfield -- Blatchford case, has very similar language.

20

Indians can bring an action against the State under the

22

all civil actions did not include the right to bring an

23

action against the Eleventh Amendment -- a State under

24

the Eleventh Amendment, because you're dealing with a

25

constitutional issue.

In that case, the Court held that

And in this case -- I think that goes to

2

Justice Kennedy's point -- we're not saying that, you know,

3

any cause of action that perhaps was created after 1970

4

wouldn't be barred, but when you're talking about a

5

constitutional cause of action, there is a difference.

6

And you -- Congress has to at least consider the issue,

7

balance the policy considerations, and make an informed

8

decision in order for this Court to abrogate a

9

constitutional right.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And Carlson is your best

11

authority for that?

12

authority?

that proposition?

20

MR. DOYLE:

I think Webster v. Doe is

21

another example of a case where this Court would not

22

abrogate a constitutional right based on fairly clear

23

language that said the director of the CIA had

24

discretion to terminate anybody.

25

terminated a CIA employee because he was homosexual, and

And in that case, he

believe there has been that clear statement, but --

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And so we don't

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Okay.

It wouldn't -- it wouldn't apply

17

18

sequence of enactment is dispositive, I think is the

19

point.

MR. DOYLE:

It is.

thing -- even though Bivens was before Congress -- and

8

even though the Gonzalez Act doesn't have an exception for

9

Bivens claims, you read one into the Gonzalez Act?

10

MR. DOYLE:

Your Honor, I -- I would say the

11

Gonzalez Act also wouldn't bar Bivens claims, because

12

it's just the sequence of enactment -- but I mean, if

13

it was -- if it had shown in some way that Congress

14

considered the constitutional issue -- and the legislative

15

history of the Gonzalez Act shows that it did not at

9

MR. DOYLE:

You're

It doesn't have to be -- no?
All I'm saying is, I believe, is

that -- is that in this case, if you look at the actual

10

statute that's at issue, no matter what test you use,

11

whether you -- whether you -- whether you like

12

legislative history, whether you -- whether you only

13

look at plain text, or whether you want to look at

14

what's the alternative remedy, is it equivalent to a

15

constitutional claim, this statute doesn't pass muster.

16

It is clear that Congress never considered whether or

17

not to abrogate a constitutional cause of action in

18

1970.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think his point is it doesn't

20

matter whether they did or didn't consider it; the

21

question is the statute was decided by Justice Brennan

22

as an example of a statute where Congress did explicitly

23

say whatever it thought that this particular remedy was

24

a remedy exclusive, an exclusive remedy, and that

25

satisfied the second requirement of Carlson.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

That was

Official

1

Justice Ginsburg's first question.

2

that's, I think, the problem for you in this case.

3

MR. DOYLE:

And -- and there --

Your Honor, again, I don't want

4

to repeat my answer to that question, but just to

5

emphasize that -- that the Court in Carlson did not

6

specifically say that Bivens claims were barred by

7

reference to 233.

8

there is a distinct difference between malpractice and

9

deliberate indifference in 1980, because Estelle had

10

It mentioned malpractice.

And

been decided 4 years earlier.

11

So, one of the other anomalies here is that

12

looking at -- at -- at the practical effect, going to

13

your implied repeal question, Justice Scalia, the only

14

work that -- that 233(a) would have left to do under the

15

Petitioners' reading is -- is to bar Bivens claims.

16

when Congress enacted the statute in 1970, Bivens didn't

17

even exist.

18

And

And so, the protection that -- the -- the

19

position that we are advocating protects doctors because

20

the Westfall Act extends much broader immunity to common

21

law torts, to any wrongful act or omission, not just

22

actions performing medical functions.

23

completely consistent with Congress's intent in 1970

24

when constitutional claims didn't even exist.

25

And so, this is

And so, when Congress looked at the issue,
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

examined it and decided whether -- whether there's a

2

difference between Bivens and the common law and whether

3

the FTCA was adequate to substitute for Bivens, it made

4

a decision to expressly preserve Bivens actions in this

5

case.

6

233 bars Bivens claims here, you have to reconcile it

7

with the Westfall Act, because the Westfall Act

8

expressly preserves Bivens claims.

9

And even if, Your Honors, you believe that

And it is a comprehensive statute; it is

10

a later passed statute; and it is specific to the issue before

11

the Court, which is can -- can a Bivens claim be brought

12

against a Public Health Service doctor?

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Westfall Act could be

14

read to say we're now covering all these people who did

15

not have, who were not sheltered by immunity before, but

16

this amendment saves out Bivens claims.

17

that as self-contained and not touching other statutes

18

that existed independently before.

19

MR. DOYLE:

One could read

Your Honor, I -- I -- I don't

20

think that's a reasonable reading, because at the time

21

of the Westfall Act's passage in 1988, no court had held

22

that Bivens claims were barred by section 233 or any

23

other pre-Act immunity statute like the Gonzalez Act or

24

and the VA Act.

25

And the legislative history of the Westfall

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Act shows that, in 1988, Congress believed that the

2

Westfall Act would simply extend the protections

3

available to -- to government employees before Westfall

4

v. Erwin, and that -- and that people would still be

5

able to bring constitutional claims against members of

6

the Federal government.

7

And so, Congress had no reason in 1988 to

8

go back and amend the -- the earlier passed 233,

9

because there was no indication -- judicial construction

10

or the legislative history -- that 233 ever barred Bivens

11

claims in the first place.

12

And so, adopting the Petitioners' position

13

in this case would -- would subvert congressional

14

intent, because it would say that, you know, when

15

Congress finally weighed all of the considerations in

16

the case, decided whether Bivens and the FTCA were

17

adequate, it decided to -- it decided to preserve Bivens

18

claims rather than bar them.

19

And -- and -- and so, accepting the

20

Petitioners' position would just subvert

21

that intent based on an Act that was passed prior to

22

Bivens existing, prior to a constitutional cause of

23

action being accepted for this type of action, and it --

24

and it would just be completely inconsistent with what

25

Congress has -- has done to protect Federal employees.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just be sure I

2

understand your argument?

3

it have covered every immunity that the Public Health

4

Act previously provided?

5

the prior statute is now totally unnecessary and does

6

nothing except preserve the Bivens -- preserve the

7

immunity for Bivens actions?

8
9

MR. DOYLE:

Is the Westfall Act -- would

So, is it correct that the --

No, Your Honor, I don't think I

got to finish that answer before.

But if you look at --

10

at the appendix to our -- our brief from page 28

11

to 62, there's two pages in there, page 29 and page 55,

12

that show that section (a) still has meaning, because

13

there's a host of non-Federal employees, people that --

14

that are government contractors that provide services to

15

free health clinics and the like that can be deemed

16

employees of the Public Health Service and then take

17

advantage of their immunity.

18

wouldn't be able to take advantage of the immunity

19

under FTCA, because they aren't Federal employees.

20

But otherwise, they

So 233(a) still has work to do, even under

21

our construction.

And so, surely, it would not protect

22

Public Health Service employees any more because they

23

have greater protections in the Westfall Act, and, again,

24

the Petitioners' reading here would -- the only work it

25

would have left to do would be to bar Bivens claims, but

And before I -- I conclude, I just want to

5

speak for a moment about, you know, the importance of

6

this case under the -- the Bivens jurisprudence.

7

mean, the purpose of Bivens -- this Court has acknowledged

8

recently in Meyer and Malesko is to provide deterrence

9

to -- to Federal officers.

And this is exactly the type

10

of case that -- that -- where deterrence is important,

because government employees should not feel that they

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if they win, will

they?

5

MR. DOYLE:

On one claim, but one of our

6

claims, the most important claim here, is -- is -- will

7

be extinguished under California law, which highlights

8

why, you know, Congress would not want to -- why this

9

Court in Carlson, first of all, said that the FTCA is not

10

an effective substitute for Bivens, and Congress

11

ratified that decision 8 years later in the Westfall

12

Act by finding the same thing, that -- that Bivens

13

claims and the FTCA are complementary and parallel

14

causes of action, because for the very reason that, under

15

California law in this case, a survival claim for

16

pre-death pain and suffering for -- for Mr. Castaneda,

17

who endured an incredible ordeal for 2 years at the hands

18

of a government medical provider, that that -- that claim

19

would be barred.

20

And so I would urge this Court to follow its

21

-- its precedent in Carlson and recognize that Congress,

22

8 years later in the Westfall Act, actually ratified

23

that holding that said that the FTCA is not an adequate

24

substitute for a Bivens action for the reasons I've set

25

forth.

Ms. Goldenberg, you have 3 minutes remaining.

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Just two quick points, if

6

I may.

One is that I think you can't read this Court's

7

Bivens jurisprudence to set forth any kind of clear

8

statement rule in this context.

9

Carlson was decided, this Court has looked for

In many cases after

10

indications that Congress thought the judiciary should

11

stay its hands, and it has found those indications in

12

the mere existence of some kind of statutory scheme,

13

even where Congress has said nothing express about

14

whether that scheme should be exclusive or not.

15

If it can be the case that, simply by setting

16

forth an elaborate scheme, Congress can indicate its

17

intent that this particular implied cause of action

18

shouldn't go forward, then it must be true also that

19

where Congress expressly says that it shouldn't go

20

forward, that that can be given effect.
And I point out that there is not a cutting off

21
22

of a constitutional right here.

It's just that there is

23

a specific cause of action that isn't going to be

24

allowed to go forward because it's one that this Court

25

would imply.
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Secondly, just to go back to my answer to

2

Justice Kennedy's question before, the case that I meant

3

to cite to you was Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, 129 Supreme

4

Court 855, and that talked about absolute immunity

5

reflecting a balance of evils.

6

7

would rather protect the PHS, make sure that causes of

8

action and liability aren't hanging over the heads of

9

PHS officers, even if that means that some individuals

Congress has decided that it

10

don't get recovery against certain specific PHS

11

ask that the decision of the Ninth Circuit be reversed.
