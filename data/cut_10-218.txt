ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The State's claim to back rent here is truly

11

remarkable.

When these dams were built back in the day,

12

PPL's predecessors, Petitioner's predecessors, secured

13

all the necessary property rights and easements.

14

part of that process, particularly for the dams that

15

created reservoirs, there was an elaborate process of

16

getting flood easements and, in many cases, paying

17

substantial amounts of money.

18

was hidden; it was open and notorious.

19

State assisted by lending the utilities its eminent

20

domain power to deal with holdouts.

As

In that process, nothing
Indeed, the

21

But now, a hundred years later, the State

22

comes in with a holdout claim of its own and suggests

23

that it's entitled to massive compensation based on the

24

small strip of riverbed that lies underneath these

25

flooded reservoirs and the dams.

The Montana Supreme

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

Court allowed that claim to succeed to the tune of tens

2

of millions of dollars of back rent.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, it did --

Well, is your point that

4

there should be a Federal rule of laches or estoppel, or

5

are you just building up to the fact that this is

6

traditional, well-recognized doctrine and there's been

7

-- and there's been a sudden change?

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

going, Justice Kennedy.

That's exactly where I was
I was suggesting that the

10

Montana Supreme Court could only approve this result,

11

which clearly did unsettle settled expectations, by

12

deviating from well-settled principles of Federal

13

navigability law.

14

Now, the mistakes were a little bit

15

different for each of the rivers at issue.

16

Clark Fork and the Upper Missouri, the critical error I

17

believe with the Montana Supreme Court decision was its

18

failure to focus on the river segments that are directly

19

at issue and instead focus on the river as a whole.

20

As to the

With the Madison, the errors are different,

21

because, as the Madison, there's no evidence that any

22

stretch of that river was navigable at statehood.

23

there the problem was principally that the court relied

24

on modern-day evidence of recreational use to substitute

25

for true historic evidence of commercial navigation at

JUSTICE ALITO:

On the issue of whether we

should look to the segments or to the river as a whole,

4

what authorities can we consult?

U.S. v. Utah, and that certainly is a relevant

precedent; but there's disagreement about what it means,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, all of this, I take

4

it, derives from the rule that pre-exists -- pre-existed

5

the adoption of the Constitution, that the sovereign

6

owned the navigable rivers within its borders.

7

some body of common law that addresses this, that would

8

shed some light on whether that means the whole river or

9

it means segments?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Is there

There really isn't,

Justice Alito, because we get our common law from

13

different.

16

17

In England, actually, the common law was
At England, the navigable waters ended at

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, every internal stream

So, what -- what is the

18

origin of the rule that the original 13 States owned the

19

navigable rivers or parts of the rivers but not the

20

parts that weren't.

21

colonial law?

22

That was some feature of American

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

I mean, it was -- it

23

was adopted as part of -- the sort of -- just the idea

24

of creating the sovereign republic of the United States.

25

We borrowed our common law.

I think initially nobody

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

focused on these navigable segments.

2

And it's important to recognize this issue

3

really doesn't even arise in the eastern United States,

4

because until about 1850 this idea that States could own

5

the riverbeds if they were nonnavigable never really

6

occurred to anyone.

7

as a matter of State law, whether a river is navigable

8

or nonnavigable, the riparian owns to the middle of the

9

streambed.

10

So, in most of the eastern States

So, after 1851, this Court recognizes --

11

makes clear to the States that they actually have a

12

choice.

13

after 1851, many of them, including Montana, adopt the

14

rule that, well, unless these -- if these streams are

15

nonnavigable, then we take the river stream.

16

that's where the question comes up.

17

And so, the States that come into the Union

And so,

So, maybe the reason there isn't a great

18

deal of precedent on this is explained by the fact that

19

this is an issue that largely arises in the western

20

United States.

21

mistake to kind of look a gift horse in the mouth, so to

22

speak, and not focus on Utah, because Utah is a

23

situation that seems irreconcilable with the Montana

24

Supreme Court decision and the State's basic theory,

If we can't --

11

Could you define "de

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- what's the guidance

or limit that we set for States?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

I've thought about this a lot,

13

Justice Sotomayor, and I'm not here to give you a sound

14

bite that's a bright-line definition of "de minimis."

15

think "de minimis" almost by its nature takes its -- its

16

meaning from the context of the inquiry.

17

let me offer at least three guideposts that I think are

18

helpful.

19

But let me --

I

One, as a practical matter, I think this

20

Court can look to its own cases dealing with islands in

21

navigable stream, and those cases are on page 17 of the

22

Government's brief.

23

there's a small island in navigable stream, under an

24

acre, of negligible value, we basically ignore it.

25

Later cases, though, came along and dealt with islands

And this Court's cases say, if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

that were much larger, and the Court analyzed those

2

separately from the navigable stream and said the United

3

States actually retains ownership to the larger islands,

4

and they don't go.

5

So, that's one place to look.

The second place to look, I think, is also a

6

practical judgment based on the nature of the lawsuit.

7

And here the State itself has come in and identified

8

stretches of riverbed that they think are significant

9

enough to generate $50 million in back rent.

And I

10

think they, having identified those riverbed stretches

11

as being worth $50 million, are hard pressed to then

12

turn around and say, oh, but they're de minimis, just

13

ignore them.

14

The third rule I would point to is that I

15

think topography has something of a role to play here.

16

If you look at the special master's report in Utah or

17

some of the other cases that have decided the point at

18

which the navigability stops, they've pointed to

19

features of the river as defining a discernible segment

20

like a tributary coming in or the geology of the -- of

21

the bed over which the river runs.

22

kind of a silty loam to hard rock in a canyon, that's

23

something that you can point to.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If it shifts from

I know you've told me

that you think Montello is not pertinent because it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

involved a different issue.

But assuming that it were

2

pertinent, because I'm not quite sure how its discussion

3

doesn't fit the needs here, one of the factors you

4

haven't mentioned in terms of de minimis is the portage

5

and its use with respect to commerce.

6

mean, it appeared to me in Montello, what the Court was

7

saying was the history of use of this river showed that

8

these obstructions didn't stop the flow of commerce,

9

that what people did was, it appeared, some extreme

10

things.

They got off -- they got their goods off one

11

boat, walked it a certain distance or drove it by wagon

12

another distance, and then put it on another boat or the

13

same boat that they had lessened the load on and moved

14

it over.

15

that portage; it talks about the impact on commerce.

And so, it doesn't talk about the distance of

factor in the de minimis issue?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

And so, why isn't that a

Well, I mean -If there were a history

here.
MR. CLEMENT:

Sure, but, Justice Sotomayor,

23

I think -- I mean, there are sort of two portages that

24

are floating around in The Montello, and I think it's

25

important to distinguish between the two.

Alderson Reporting Company

There's kind

Official

11

of the classic overland portage between the Fox River

2

and the Wisconsin River.

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There was a canal in

there, wasn't there?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, afterwards.

But

6

originally that was an overland portage.

7

really not at issue, but that's kind of the -- you know,

8

the classic portage I have in mind is an overland

9

portage.

10

And so, that's

Now, they're also talking about the extreme

11

efforts, and you could call them portages.

I don't

12

think you need to.

13

extreme efforts to enable navigation on the Fox before

14

improvement.

But there's also talk about the

15

But that's nothing like what's at issue here

16

because those were efforts basically to use the riverbed

17

to -- and they had to do some extraordinary things:

18

ox to pull the boat, lift them up over some rocks.

19

they never really left the bed of the river there.

20

Where they left the bed of the river was the portage

21

over to the Wisconsin.

22
23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

Well, in Montello, they

took the cargo off some boats --

24

MR. CLEMENT:

Oh, absolutely.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and moved it overland

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

to another spot before they put it back on a boat.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure, but my understanding of

3

what was going on there -- and maybe I misunderstood it,

4

but I understand what they're talking about there is a

5

portage where you take the cargo out of the boat in

6

order to lighten the draft of the boat so it's not

7

sitting as deeply in the river, and that allows the

8

lighter boat to be carried over the --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We can both look at the

10

opinion, but I think there is one spot where the Court

11

says that in some areas they had to change boats.

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well -- and that may be, but,

13

I mean, again, I don't think we're talking about

14

anything like the distances that we're talking here, and

15

I also --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't disagree with

17

you, but I -- what I'm asking is, if we had a history of

18

navigation of cargo that went to the beginning of one of

19

these rivers -- and I'm not a sailor, so my terms -- the

20

cargo is taken off and driven by wagon or some other

21

mode to another spot and picked up again.

22

different situation than one where that doesn't happen?

23

That because this -- this length of portage is so long

24

that it is both economically and physically impossible

25

to transport cargo in that way.

Is that a

Is that a different

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

case for the question of navigability?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, sure, because these are

3

all matters of degree, and those would be two different

4

cases.

5

if at the point that you have to take the cargo off of

6

the boats, and then you then have to leave the channel,

7

you don't just do a little cut around some de minimus

8

amount, but you leave the channel and go overland, at

9

that point, I think, that portage demonstrates the

But here's what I would point you to, which is,

10

non-navigability of the bypassed stretch.

11

think --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And then I

Well, maybe it

13

demonstrates the non-navigability of the particular

14

stretch, but we would still speak of the transfer of

15

commerce as being along the river.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I don't --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The sort of case --

18

the analogy I was thinking of is if I say I fly from

19

Washington to Tokyo; and someone says, no, you didn't,

20

you flew to San Francisco, then you walked however many

21

yards from one gate to another, and then you flew to

22

Tokyo.

23

when I -- you know, part of the distance where I wasn't

24

flying, but people would still say you flew from D.C. to

25

Tokyo.

And I would say, well, yes, there's a gap there

Now, why isn't this just like that, that the

commercial path, the commercial waterway people think of

2

as the Missouri?

3

get out, and, you know, we can debate how long the

4

portage is, but it doesn't interrupt the notion that

5

that whole pathway would qualify as a navigable

6

waterway.

7

And, yes, occasionally you've got to

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, two things,

8

Mr. Chief Justice.

One is I do want to make clear that

9

we very much dispute factually that there ever was this

10

kind of commercial portage over the Great Falls.

11

the really -- you know, there's very little evidence for

12

the record.

15

16

And

The State's own evidence identifies Fort

So, there is very much a

But to answer the legal question you're

17

asking, first of all, I'm not sure I would have the same

18

instinct about the common parlance if you had to go from

19

JFK to LaGuardia in a cab.

20

you would have the same notion if you had to drive from

21

San Francisco to LA to switch planes.

22

distance here really does matter.

23

the way you think about this, the way I would think

24

about this, is that the very need to bypass, especially

25

a substantial bypass where you leave the river channel,

And I'm even less sure that

And I think the

And I would submit

Alderson Reporting Company

15
1

is evidence that that part of the channel, that part of

2

the river, is nonnavigable.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5

I don't see why -And then the question that's

left is whether that's de minimis.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't see why portage is

7

relevant at all.

What's the basis for the rule that the

8

sovereign owns the navigable rivers?

9

because they are viewed -- they were viewed as highways

I assume it's

10

for transportation and commerce.

11

there's an obstruction that cannot be traversed by a

12

boat, then there isn't going to be any commerce or

13

transportation along that area.

14

And to the extent that

Now, there might be an argument that the

15

sovereign should own the land next to the river so that

16

you could portage around it, but what -- what would be

17

the justification for saying the sovereign owns the

18

portion of the river that can't be traversed at all by

19

boat?

20

I just don't understand it.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'm with you on that,

21

Justice Alito, and I think, you know, logically, if you

22

think what's the highway of commerce here, if there

23

really was this 18-mile overland portage route, that

24

would be the highway of commerce, but the 17-mile

25

bypassed stretch of the Missouri and the Great Falls

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

Reach would not be a highway of commerce.

2

that gets back to the expectations of the property owner

3

that ultimately underlie these title questions.

4

And I think

I mean, if you have boats going by a river

5

in your backyard, I mean, you have -- you're on sort of

6

notice that you don't own the riverbed.

7

in a part of the river that's -- that's so unnavigable

8

that it has to be bypassed and you've never seen a boat

9

in your experience ever, then I think you have very

But I'm not a

3

Midwesterner, and rivers of 200 miles are normal there,

4

I understand.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, these -- this is still a

6

big stretch and I do think, like I said, longer than

7

some entire rivers.

8

the 2 miles of the Thompson Fall, I don't know exactly

9

where that number comes from.

But the Thompson Falls -- I mean,

It's kind of an

13

I mean, there -- again, the State's own

There wasn't a portage around.

But the other point is I would also ask you

14

to look at the 1910 court decree because, as I said at

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

their boat on their shoulders, which apparently in The

5

Montello they did.

6

What's the answer to --

MR. KNEEDLER:

They didn't carry the boat

7

out of the river.

These were Durham boats that were

8

70-feet long and -- and weighed quite a bit.

9

there were small canoes that could have been done.

Now, maybe
I --

10

I think a small portage -- again, I don't think it's the

11

length of the portage; I think it's the interruption of

the -- of the navigable portion of the river that --

13

that is -- that is relevant, and if it's large enough to

14

constitute a -- a sensible administrable parcel, that

15

that should be enough.

16

I did want to take one moment to discuss the

17

Madison River because there, as Mr. Clement discussed,

18

the considerations are somewhat different.

19

I mean, first of all, the court made a

20

similar mistake there by discussing the river as a whole

and a log float in the middle stretch of the river, but

22

not focusing on the relevant stretches where the dams

without a proper foundation to determine whether that

the relevant question is whether whatever boats are used

fact that few of the nation's great rivers did not

include some, quote, "serious interruptions to

16

uninterrupted navigation."

17

answer to that geographic fact was not to say then let's

modes of trade and travel.

8

other situation -- your alleged gold miners and fur

9

traders?

10

Has that happened on -- on the -- in the Great

Falls?
MR. GARRE:

If you take the Great Falls, the

12

history of portage from 1864 to 1868 was lively commerce

13

of millions of dollars, in today's value, billions of

14

dollars of gold, from Helena to Fort Benton back east.

Let me put it this way:

15

Why -- why should -- why does the State own a navigable

17

MR. GARRE:

Because the navigable rivers

18

were the arteries of commerce in this country, and at

19

the time of the founding, it was understood -- and this

20

gets to the core issue of federalism in this case --

21

that the States ought to be the ones that control the

22

navigable rivers --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, and if that's the

reason -MR. GARRE:

-- not the Federal Government.

Alderson Reporting Company

34

JUSTICE ALITO:

If that's the reason for the

2

rule, than what is the justification for State ownership

3

of a portion of the river that is not navigable?

4

MR. GARRE:

I think this gets back to the

5

question of whether you can just chop up the rivers into

6

navigable and nonnavigable bits.

7

this Court, Justice O'Connor observed in her dissent in

8

the Phillips Petroleum case that navigability wasn't

9

decided inch by inch.

And we're talking --

What the other side is asking you

10

to adopt here is a test of navigability that's at least

11

mile by mile, if not acre by acre, which is completely

12

different than this Court has ever assessed

13

navigability.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

The rule that you're arguing

15

for might be an established rule that we should follow,

16

but as a matter of theory, I don't understand what the

17

justification is for State ownership of a nonnavigable

18

portion of the river if the reason for the underlying

19

rule is so that people will not put up obstructions on

20

the river so that they -- it can be maintained as an --

21

as an avenue of commerce.

22

State would own that, because otherwise riparian owners

could put up fences and obstructions and charge tolls

MR. GARRE:

What -- what the Framers were

concerned about -- and this is also reflected in the

4

Northwest Ordinance 2 -- was ensuring that the navigable

5

rivers, the major arteries of commerce in this country,

6

remained open.

7

more -- much broader conception of navigability than

8

is suggested --

And so, they -- they applied a much

And so, that was the argument --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You've -- you've got falls.

14

15

to -- to be sure that that river remains open to

commerce?

What does it mean

Commerce is impossible over it.
MR. GARRE:

And so, that was the argument

18

that the district court adopted in The Montello case,

in the Utah case, you'd ask yourself that question, and

14

you would say, no, this is not part of a continuous

15

highway of commerce, because no one argued either that

16

the canyon was portaged or that goods were traveling

17

down the Colorado River through the canyon and out into

18

Arizona.

19

If you ask yourself that question in this

20

case, along the Great Falls, you would say yes, because

21

the evidence was unrebutted that millions of dollars of

22

gold was traveled up from Helena to Fort Benton along

23

the -- the Missouri River with the aid of a portage and

24

that that was unquestionably a highway of commerce.

25

What they're asking this Court to do is chop

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see.

So, the rule is, on

the nonnavigable streams, it depends on what the

conveyance was at the time of statehood, and those are

10

individual matters, and sometimes --

11

MR. GARRE:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

Right.
-- you'll see the feds own

them and sometimes the States.

MR. GARRE:

MR. GARRE:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. GARRE:

Is that right?

Yes, I think that's right.
Okay.

And what was critically

19

important to the -- to the Framers was that the States

20

would have control over the navigable waterways.

21

Court has described that as an essential attribute of

22

State sovereignty.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This

But we're talking

24

about the land at the bottom of the -- the river.

25

is it that the State can't do on the navigable waterways

Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official

39
1

that it wants to do?

2

MR. GARRE:

Well, owner -- the ownership --

3

along with ownership goes the right to control whether

4

facilities can be built on them, bridges or pipelines.

5

It goes -- along with that goes the rights to mineral

6

leases --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But as -- but as the Chief

8

Justice is indicating, I think, this concerns who owns

9

the bed; and that's different from navigable waters of

10

the United States.

11

And some of the answers you gave to

12

Justice Alito about -- that the purposes and the reasons

13

for navigable waters of the United States are quite

14

different, really, than for the considerations we have

15

about riparian ownership.

16

United States can be controlled by the United States for

17

many purposes, but that is concurrent with a separate

18

document -- doctrine for underlying ownership of the

19

bed.

Navigable waters of the

20

MR. GARRE:

Right.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it's not clear to me

22

that the test for navigable waters is the same in each

23

case as to the whole river.

24
25

MR. GARRE:

I think that the test that we're

articulating is The Daniel Ball and The Montello test --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40

continuous highway test.

2

riverbeds, it's always been understood that with control

3

of the riverbeds along navigable waters, States have a

4

right to control fishing and navigation and other

5

aspects.

6

I think with respect to the

JUSTICE BREYER:

But, now, Montello was a

7

case -- to follow up this same question.

Montello, I

8

take it, was not a title case.

Montello was a

9

regulation of the stream case.

So, I can understand

10

perfectly well why that language in Montello applies for

11

the reason Justice Kennedy just said.

12

that they -- in later title cases, this Court has taken

13

the same words and written them.

14

instance in the later title cases where that language

15

has played a controlling role?

16

MR. GARRE:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, I grant you

But is there an

Well, the -What case should I look at

18

to see that it was really meant that that -- this --

19

see, start where Justice Scalia was and then say what

20

Justice Kennedy just said --

21

MR. GARRE:

There's certainly --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and then thinking,

23

well -- I'm thinking, well, Montello was a case that

24

involved a different purpose, and now the later cases,

25

although they quoted the language, it didn't have a

Alderson Reporting Company

role.

Am I right or not?

2

MR. GARRE:

This case has recognized always

3

that The Daniel Ball and The Montello is the test for

4

navigability for title as well as admiralty.

5

never drawn the kind of distinction that PPL and the

6

United States ask you to draw here.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

held that?

9

a difference?

It has

The question is, has it

Do you have a case where it would have made

10

MR. GARRE:

Not -- not of this Court.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. GARRE:

Okay.

And the lower courts have relied

13

upon The Daniel Ball and The Montello in plenty of

14

circumstances adjudicating title.

15

to think about what the world would look like if the

16

Court adopted PPL and the United States' views.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think the Court has

Well, if this is such an

18

understood and traditional rule, why -- why didn't

19

Montana make its rights known earlier when these private

20

owners bought the land?

21

condemnation power to flood adjacent lands so that they

22

could build their dams.

Indeed, the State gave them

MR. GARRE:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Again -And you say while all this

was going on, well, of course, everybody knew that

Alderson Reporting Company

Montana owned this land.

2

And now they come back, what, a hundred

3

years later, and they not only want to get the land

back, they want to tax them for their use of it over --

5

over all these hundred years.

for the riverbeds.

2

The State in this case --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And what about other

3

landowners on the riverbeds?

4

will they be paying rent as well?

5

MR. GARRE:

If Montana wins this case,

They're not using the riverbeds,

6

Your Honor.

The reason why the facilities here are

7

using the riverbeds is because they actually sit on it.

8

There are other instances where private landowners have

9

easements and leases, like mineral leases with the

10

State, under the -- because of the accepted

11

understanding that the State does own those lands.

12

this is not at all unusual.

13

And

If you look at the State's brief, Washington

14

and Oregon have thousands of these types of permits

15

because it's established that if the water is navigable,

16

then the State owns the riverbeds, and there are

17

consequences that flow over this.

18

a fight between the State and the private landowners.

19

It's -- it's a fight between the State and the United

20

States, because if this case --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But this really isn't

Just if I could understand

22

then, you think that this is a one of a kind landowner;

23

there are no other landowners in Montana who are in the

24

situation of PPL?

25

MR. GARRE:

No, I think there are other

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

landowners who have asserted -- who want rights to use

2

-- to get minerals along rivers or have piers or

3

bridges, and in those situations, they get permits from

4

the State to use it.

5

is, if this Court declares that every mile or so that is

6

an interruption is nonnavigable, then title is going to

7

transfer to the United States because, under this

8

Court's precedent in Utah, the Court held that if waters

9

were not navigable, the United States would have --

10
11

But I think what's going to happen

The best evidence I think we

have about this question of the implications comes from

the brief filed by 26 States, which explains that if

this Court adopts the kind of segmentation approach, any

5

carved out, it's going to wreak havoc in States across

the country, especially in the western States.

7

getting back to --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Again,

When you say "wreak havoc,"

do you mean to say that the States have leased those

10

strips with the waterfalls which are impassable to

11

hydroelectric companies, and the leases will have to be

12

renegotiated or something like that?

But there would be the question --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, there you are.

And

7

you think the United States is going to keep off these

fishermen?

9

MR. GARRE:

The question is whether there'd

10

be a separate conveyance from the United States.

There's certainly going to be plenty of private

landowners, I think, who are going to claim private

ownership.

So, there is going to be some sorting out to

MR. GARRE:

Well, no.

the river is not navigable, then the lands didn't convey

Or, on the other hand, are there some cases where a body

of water, say the falls, is navigable waters of the

And the third is, for

This case, the focus has been on the rivers

8

at the time of statehood, their use as highways of

9

commerce without improvements, which is in the heartland

10

of the test for title for navigability under The Daniel

11

Ball and The Montello.

12

None of the distinctions that this Court has

13

ever recognized would bear on this, nor would it make

14

any sense, I think, to say that the rule that we

15

identified in The Montello as -- that has -- for more

16

than a century, has been established as the test for

17

title for navigability somehow has to be applied

18

differently in this case in a way that would require

19

breaking up the rivers.

20

And I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it is conceded, is it

21

not, that -- if we rule for the power companies in this

22

case, there still may be a situation in which these

23

waters can be navigable waters of the United States for

24

other purposes, other than ownership of the bed?

25

I wrong on that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Or am

Official

51
1

MR. GARRE:

No, I think the United States'

2

position is say they're navigable for Federal purposes

3

but not for State purposes.

4

taken what I think is a pretty remarkable position.

5

And I think -- and they've

If you look at the briefs that we've

6

appended to our brief, the United States' in the Montana

7

Power Company case, the United States is saying that the

8

very same stretch of the Missouri along the Great Falls

9

is navigable because it served as a continuous highway

10

of commerce, and the falls did not prevent the river

11

from being used as a continuous highway; and, therefore,

12

it's navigable under The Montello and The Daniel Ball,

13

which is the theory that they recognize.

14

And now they're here saying, well, that was

15

only for regulatory purposes, not for title purposes.

16

But it's the same test in both cases, and that's the

17

test that the nation has understood for more than

18

50 years.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but I'm not sure

20

it has the same consequences.

It seems to me that

21

regardless of who prevails in this case, the State will

22

be able to exercise regulatory jurisdiction over the

23

waters.

24

or there are different limits on how many fish you can

25

take.

You know, you can't fish during these seasons,

And so will the Federal Government.

Alderson Reporting Company

It will be

Official

52
1

able to apply Federal law to the river regardless of who

2

owns parts of the river, regardless of who owns the land

3

underneath.

4

MR. GARRE:

And so, this Court has always

5

recognized the States' authority to make those decisions

6

as an essential attribute of their sovereignty.

7

that's why the States --

8
9
10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Without regard --

but I would say without regard to whether they happened
to own the land under the -- under the river or not.
MR. GARRE:

No, when they -- when they own

12

the land under the river, that -- the ability to control

13

access along those rivers -- river and fishing and the

14

like is an essential attribute of State sovereignty.

15

So, just saying that, well, the Federal Government and

16

the State can regulate together is, I think, an

17

important intrusion on State sovereignty as this Court

18

has always understood under the equal footing doctrine

19

and the public trust doctrine.

20

And you also have the problem of competing

21

regulation of these rivers when you go from mile to

22

mile, interruption to interruption, potentially

23

thousands along rivers.

brief by the environmental groups here, the National

25

Wildlife Foundation and Trout Unlimited and other

And that's laid out in the

groups, that talk about the problems with fragmented

2

regulatory jurisdiction.

3

And you also get into the question of public

4

access for fishing, too.

5

commerce, but the public trust doctrine was always used

6

to protect access to rivers for fishing, too.

7

if you look at a place like the Great Falls or the

8

Thompson Falls, these are among the most sought-after

9

fishing rivers in the world.

10

The rivers are used for

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so,

You're willing to concede

11

on behalf of the State that if we find that the State

12

does not have ownership of the bed, the State does not

13

have regulatory jurisdiction for all of these purposes

14

that you're now describing?

15

MR. GARRE:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.
Well, then your argument

doesn't carry much weight.

18

MR. GARRE:

Well --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

The State can continue to

20

regulate all those things whether or not it owns the

21

bed.

22

MR. GARRE:

And so, every time this Court

23

has said that the ability to do that is an essential

24

attribute of sovereignty, it must not have meant it

25

because the United States could do it, too.

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, it

Official

54
1

is important to the States because having the sovereign

2

capacity over those riverbeds as navigable waters under

3

the public trust doctrine is critical to the States'

4

authority.

5
6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you have sovereignty

over the land owned, owned by other private persons.
MR. GARRE:

And -- and I think it gets back

8

to the public trust doctrine, the equal footing

9

doctrine, what this Court has said in the Utah case and

10

other cases about the role of States in regulating

11

navigable rivers and owning title to the riverbeds

12

underlying those rivers.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We haven't talked

14

much about the Madison.

15

of evidence with respect to the Madison for the

16

proposition that it was navigable at statehood?

17

MR. GARRE:

What -- what is your best piece

Well, there was some evidence of

18

use by fur trappers and the like.

19

because this area was relatively sparse.

20

It was not extensive

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think --

Well, fur trappers

21

are going to go -- they don't need a lot of -- a lot of

22

water to ply their canoes up the river.

23

MR. GARRE:

Well, and this Court has

24

recognized that things like pirogues and bateaux were

25

sufficient to establish the continuous highway of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

commerce.

2

I think the point on the Madison is the

3

susceptibility for use as a navigable river.

4

main point that we made below is that where their own

5

expert recognized that PPL's dams had impeded the flow

6

of water over of the river, that if those dams impede

7

the flow of water over the river but yet today there are

8

thousands of drift boats similar to the boats that would

9

have used it at the time of statehood, then it's good

10

evidence that it was susceptible for use.

11
12

And the

But I think the Madison is in a different
category than the Missouri and the Clark Fork.

13

I do want to answer the question about the

14

17 miles.

The Desplaines River in the Economy Light

15

case, there was an 18-mile portage.

16

at page 18a of our addendum, where the Government

17

recognized that.

18

In -- there are other examples of portages.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's made clear

In Montello, it was a 5-mile portage.

20

was that the canal?

21

area?

Five miles, was that --

What subsequently became the canal

22

MR. GARRE:

I -- I think that's right.

23

in the testimony in that decision.

24

17 miles -- and the other thing is, is that in the

25

amicus brief, on page 27 of the Tubbs brief, she

Alderson Reporting Company

But, certainly,

It's

56

suggests that the actual portage before statehood was

2

only 8 miles.

3

constitutional line between 5, 7, or even 10 miles and

4

17 miles.

5

I don't think you could draw a

We think the line the Constitution draws is

6

whether -- asks whether the river was -- served as a

7

continuous highway of commerce, notwithstanding any

8

interruption along that way.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think that then the

10

simplest rule is, is the river from shore to opposite

11

shore -- any portion of it -- did boats traverse it?

12

That would be I think what Justice Alito was asking.

13

MR. GARRE:

But it's not even the rule that

14

PPL was asking for, because they acknowledge that some

15

interruptions would be navigable.

16

17

They call it "non-de

It's not clear how you get there.
If you go between the low-water marks,

18

there's only a part of the way that you could actually

19

bring a boat up, but, yet, it's established that the

20

State owns the entire riverbeds between low-water mark

21

to low-water mark.

22

After traversing the Missouri and the very

23

falls at issue in this case, Meriwether Lewis described

24

that he didn't think the world could furnish a finer

25

example of a navigable river through a mountainous

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

country than the Missouri.

2

President's own agent, charged with assessing the

3

suitability of the Missouri for commerce, was consistent

4

with more than 140 years of this precedent --

5
6

That assessment made by the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did he write that during

his 30-day -- 32-day portage?

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, it was an 11-day

9

portage.

At the time of statehood, it was a 1-day

10

portage.

I think what's significant is he wrote it

11

after that portage.

12

not a finer example of a navigable river through

13

mountainous country.

14

with this Court's precedents for more than 140 years.

15

It's consistent with the actual use of the Missouri as a

16

continuous highway of commerce along the very stretch at

17

issue here.

18

And yet, he recognized there was

That assessment was consistent

We don't believe that PPL or the United

19

States has provided a legal reason for this Court to

20

overturn the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court that

21

the Missouri or the other rivers at issue in this case

22

are navigable.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

A few points in rebuttal:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you point to some

5

portages that are de minimis?

6

where they are in the United States.

7

some that are de minimis.

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:
minimis portages for you.

First, it's --

Point me -- I don't care
Give me a list of

I mean, I don't have any de
The portages he's talking

10

about, as far as I can tell, the 5-mile and the 8-mile,

11

are portages between rivers, and that has nothing to do

12

with whether the bypassed stretch of a river would be

13

nonnavigable because it's de minimis, because if you

14

portage between two rivers, you're not bypassing

15

anything.

16

Where I can talk about sort of portages

17

being de minimis, if you look at the special master's

18

report in the Utah case, there are a few places in the

19

Cataract Canyon where he talks about portages, and he

20

talks -- you know, in parts where they got boats to.

21

But the key point is, whenever the Court has talked

22

about portages in the context of navigability, they've

23

pointed to them as suggesting non-navigability, and in

24

certain circumstances said, well, you had to portage a

25

little bit, but that's not enough to make the stretch

Alderson Reporting Company

59

nonnavigable.

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what were your -- what

were your other four points you were going to give us?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I was going to give you

5

a couple, Your Honor.

I'd start with the deeds.

6

know, the State wants to make something of the fact that

7

the deeds stop at the river.

8

the State.

9

governs the ownership of the riverbeds?

But that's true throughout

And the question then becomes, what rule
And that's

10

where navigability versus non-navigability.

11

deeds don't prove anything.

12

deeds were written.

13

You

So, the

The next point:

That's just the way the

Justice Kagan, you asked

14

about, you know, do the other owner -- other people on

15

the river have anything to fear.

16

as I heard was, well, these are different.

17

the riverbed.

18

of the piers, and that's why people have filed amicus

19

briefs and are very concerned.

20

And the answer as far

Well, two things, Your Honor:

They sit on
So do some

But more to the point, these things have not

21

moved under the riverbed recently.

They've been sitting

22

there for a hundred years, and the State lent its

23

eminent domain power to us to help us build these dams.

24

These dams were critical to developing energy and

25

development in this area.

And now a hundred years

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

later, they want compensation for the little river

2

strip under that.

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could the United States

demand compensation?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

We pay the United States

6

compensation right now.

7

States isn't going in afterwards and trying to put a

8

hold-up to us and saying they want $50 million for this.

9

We pay rents to FERC for some of these lands.

10

Actually,

the State gets 37.5 percent of that back.

11
12

The difference is the United

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For the riverbed?

For the

riverbed land --

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, look at footnote 3 of

14

the Government's brief.

15

is if you want people to have deeds that really parse

16

out whether it's riverbed or upland, they don't because

17

everybody defaults to the bottom line -- the background

18

rule.

19

river, the riparian owners, whether it be the United

20

States or private property owners, get to midway, or if

21

they own both on both sides, they get the whole thing.

22

I mean, again, the problem here

The background rule is if it's a nonnavigable

I think on "de minimis," we talk about it a

23

lot, but I would point out that the one thing we know

24

that's not de minimis from Utah is 4.35 miles, because

25

that's what the Court analyzes separately in the portion

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

61

of Cataract Canyon.

2

Every stretch at issue here, every dam at

3

issue here, is more than 4.35 miles.

4

dams are on the 17-mile Great Falls stretch, which they

5

agree is impassable.

6

that create reservoirs that extend over 4.35 miles.

7

Fully five of the

The other five are reservoir dams

So, there's nothing de minimis in the best

8

evidence that is the $50 million in compensation.

9

think the $50 million in back rent also shows that

11

navigation on the Missouri, to Walla Walla, Washington.
