Mr. Horwich?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HORWICH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The State Action Doctrine provides a defense

12

to a Federal antitrust suit when a State has clearly

13

articulated and affirmatively expressed an intent to

14

displace competition with respect to the particular

15

activity at issue in the suit.

16

Now, in practical terms, what that comes

17

down to is whether application of Federal competition

18

law would somehow subvert a sovereign State policy

19

choice that's clearly evident in State law.

20

Now, that policy might be expressed in

21

mandatory or compulsory terms, but, short of that, it

22

would also be enough, if the -- the State had

23

specifically permitted conduct that is inherently

24

anticompetitive.

25

But a grant of general power to act -
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't think that the

2

grant of powers in this case would permit the hospital

3

authorities, the corporation, to set prices for their

4

services that are below the competitive prices in order

5

to serve the needy?

6

MR. HORWICH:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

Well, Justice -Isn't that inherent in

the regulations?

9

MR. HORWICH:

I think it is, although for

10

reasons that don't affect the analysis of the question

11

about an anticompetitive acquisition.

12

explain why the analysis might be different with respect

13

to prices.

14

And let me

There is specific authorization in the

15

statute for the hospital authorities, in conjunction

16

with the counties, to partly fund -- or, I guess,

17

entirely, in principle -- fund their services through

18

tax revenues.

19

that would allow them to price in ways that a

20

competitive actor would not necessarily price its

21

services.

So they have another source of funding

22

So if we're talking about particular pricing

23

decisions, say -- I guess it would be below cost pricing

24

that is alleged to somehow be anticompetitive -- then

25

there might very well be a State action defense to that
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because it -- because the State -- the power to price

2

services subsidized in a way that an ordinary actor

3

wouldn't be able to do --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. HORWICH:

Do you have --

-- might very well displace

6

competition in that regard.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have any cases in

8

which we -- we slice it that fine --

9

MR. HORWICH:

10

Well, I do think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that -- that you are a

11

State actor for some anticompetitive purposes and not

12

for others?

13

MR. HORWICH:

Yeah, absolutely,

14

Justice Scalia.

15

example comes from Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar.

16

in that case, the -- the issue was a challenge to a

17

practice of minimum fee schedules that were set by --

18

not by the State, but -- but agreed upon by a bar

19

organization.

20

I think -- I think the best -- the best
So,

Now, the State in that case, of course,

21

regulated the practice of law.

It regulated admission

22

into the practice of law.

23

of the conduct of the practice of law.

24

held, in Bates v. Arizona State Bar, that those sort of

25

regulations do constitute State action.

It regulated certain aspects

5

Alderson Reporting Company

And this Court

Official

1

But the Court did not accept the submission

2

that the State action defense covered the setting of

3

minimum prices that was at issue in that case because

4

that was not something that there was State action over.

5

And as a -- and, taking a step back, the

6

justification for the State Action Doctrine is that the

7

State is trying to pursue some policy that is part of

8

its traditional sovereign prerogatives to regulate its

9

own economy and that Federal law was not understood to

10
11

intrude upon that.
But, if the State is not actually trying to

12

advance some other policy, with respect to the

13

particular conduct at issue, then it can't be said that

14

the State has done something that Federal law should

15

stand aside for.

16

The -- the --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Horwich, you said

18

in -- in your reply brief that, if the Hospital

19

Authorities Law specifically authorized local hospital

20

authorities to acquire any and all hospitals within

21

their geographic area, then the clear articulation

22

requirement would be satisfied.

23

But the Authorities Law does authorize the

24

acquisition of other hospitals.

And it doesn't say one

25

or two; it says other -- other facilities.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So why doesn't the hospital laws law do

2

exactly what you said would satisfy the -- the clear

3

articulation requirement?

4

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think the key

5

difference there, Justice Ginsburg, between the

6

hypothetical we offered in the -- the reply brief and

7

the statute here is that the -- the additional words

8

"any and all" make it clear that the State is

9

contemplating that there could -- the county might opt

10

for socializing its hospital services, putting all of

11

them under the control of the hospital authority.

12

And, by contrast, what we have here is an

13

ordinary corporate power to acquire property.

14

all of the ordinary corporate powers that the authority

15

possesses that are -- that resemble those that -- that

16

an ordinary business corporation would have, the most

17

natural understanding of them is that the State expects

18

them to be exercised in conformity with the background

19

principles that -- that bind everybody.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And, like

So --

Just so I understand

21

your answer to Justice Ginsburg, you're saying there

22

would be a difference if the charter said the authority

23

may require -- acquire any properties to fulfill its

24

mission and if it said the authority may acquire

25

properties to promote its mission?
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think it's probably in

2

our -- the hypothetical offered in our reply brief, it's

3

probably the "all" -- the "any and all" that -- that

4

would, I think, be what communicates the State's --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think a

6

general saying they may acquire properties doesn't

7

implicitly say they may acquire all properties?

8

That seems a pretty thin --

9

MR. HORWICH:

No, I don't think it does --

10

well -- but I think, in this area, it's -- it's

11

important, for a couple reasons, that we actually

12

have -- have some substantial assurance of what the

13

State is trying to do here.

14

And a power to grant proper -- excuse me --

15

a power to acquire properties, generally speaking,

16

unadorned with any particular expression from the State

17

about how -- how that power is to be used, is -- is

18

something that can be used competitively or

19

anticompetitively.

20

And you can't infer from that that the State

21

really has an objective of, as I say, such as

22

socializing its hospital services because -- and -- and

23

it's -- and that clarity of expression from the State is

24

really important here, for several reasons.

25

First of all, this is an odd rule, to begin
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with, in that it allows State law to displace Federal

2

law.

So we would want some clarity from --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume -- I assume that

4

the normal corporate charter contains such a provision,

5

the authority to acquire property, right?

6
7

MR. HORWICH:
And --

8
9

Yeah, it absolutely does.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we don't -- that --

that charter is issued by the State, right?

10

MR. HORWICH:

It is issued by the State.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we don't -- we don't

12

think that that enables all corporations to ignore the

13

Sherman Act, do we?
MR. HORWICH:

14

No, we don't.

And we don't

15

generally think that those corporate powers express an

16

intent to displace any other background --

17

if I could give some examples, maybe we could look at

18

some --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

MR. HORWICH:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22
23

Mr. Horwich, could I just -Yes.
-- before you give examples,

just make sure I understand your basic position?
Suppose the State had said, very clearly,

24

that these hospital authorities had the power to engage

25

in acquisitions of hospitals that, for a normal actor,
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would violate the antitrust laws, but -- but basically

2

said the -- the hospital authorities had the discretion

3

to do that or not.

4

And the State didn't know the hospital

5

authority might do it, but it also might not do it.

6

That would be subject to the immunity; is that correct?

7

MR. HORWICH:

I -- I think the defense would

8

be available if -- if the beginning of your hypothetical

9

was kind of quoting the statute, yes.

10
11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

It's a clear grant of

authority --

12

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the authority is

14

completely discretionary.

So the State is basically

15

saying, we don't know, we're going to let the hospital

16

authority figure it out.

17

MR. HORWICH:

Well, it's certainly -- the

18

hospital authority can figure it -- figure out, but what

19

it's figuring out is whether to actually invoke a

20

displacement of competition that the State has expressly

21

put on the table.

22

case --

23

And that's what is different in this

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What -- but what I'm trying

24

to get at is the State has put it on the table only as a

25

completely discretionary action.

The State has not

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

expressed a preference for it.

2

The State has only said that the hospital

3

authority can think about conditions on the ground in

4

its particular locality and can decide whether such an

5

anticompetitive acquisition is appropriate.

6

MR. HORWICH:

Yes, that's fine.

We don't

7

have any quarrel with -- with States setting up a clear

8

set of tools, some of which, in your example, might

9

inherently displace competition --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

MR. HORWICH:

12

So all of this language --- and having it exercised,

actually, at a local level.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's fine.
So all this language in your

14

brief about necessarily and inherently and compelled,

15

all of those things really are not part of your -- your

16

governing test?

17

MR. HORWICH:

No.

I -- I disagree with

18

that.

The reason they are part of our governing test is

19

this:

Is that a State can certainly give a -- a menu of

20

specific options that sub-State entities can -- can

21

select from.

22

fact, not anticompetitive.

23

And it might be that some of those are, in

Let me give you an example from -- from this

24

Court's cases.

Southern Motor Carriers involved the

25

submission of -- by motor carriers, of their rates to a
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

public service commission that was -- that would accept

2

them as filed rates.

3

Now, the States -- some of the States there

4

said, well, you can file them individually, or you can

5

file them jointly, and we don't necessarily have a

6

preference, one way or the other, for it.

7

But the fact that the States had said you

8

can file them jointly, which is a horizontal agreement

9

among competitors and sure looks anticompetitive, the

10

fact that the State had said that and put that option on

11

the table qualified as a clear articulation from the

12

State that it intended the displacement of competition

13

to occur if that specific option was chosen.

14

The difference here is that, if you are

15

willing to say, in a case like what we have here with a

16

statute that -- that confers a -- a power that is

17

entirely neutral as to how it would be -- how it could

18

be exercised, you have the problem of not really knowing

19

what the State would intend.

20

the State clearly intended that there be displacement

21

of competition --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so you can't say that

Well, what about the other?

23

The next line that they give is they give to the

24

hospital authority the power to acquire and operate

25

projects and the power to form and operate one or more
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

networks of hospitals, physicians, and other healthcare

2

providers.

3

Now, as I read that, it certainly includes

4

the rather specific power of acquiring a hospital.

5

having read that -- not -- not just something you might

6

see in General Motors' charter.

7

MR. HORWICH:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

And

Well -And -- and those -- that's

the language of the -- of the grant of power.

10

Now, I want to know what you want us to do

11

because, in my mind, reading this, it's a statute that

12

provides for regulation -- price regulation of

13

hospitals.

14

thought of one way in which that could be -- I can think

15

of 100 -- that you could have prices that are different

16

from those set by a free market.

17

that this sets -- I start there.

18

And you say -- and I have no doubt you

So I have no doubt

Now, what is it -- I go back to

19

Justice Scalia's original question:

What is it you want

20

us to say?

21

does grant immunity from attack on a basis of cost and

22

price regulation, it is not immune in respect to

23

mergers, okay?

Even though this -- this statute is immune,

24

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I can, unfortunately, think

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of about 50 examples, where a merger might be

2

anticompetitive, and yet, it would lead to lower prices.

3

And the Department of Justice might attack it, but this

4

statute -- and that's what's bothering me -- seems to

5

want to further that kind of thing.

6

MR. HORWICH:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8
9

Well, I -That -- that's where I am,

and I -- I'm not at all decided.
MR. HORWICH:

Sure.

Well, I guess I

10

would -- I guess I would first point out that -- that

11

price competition is not the be-all and end-all of

12

anticompetitive consequences, right?

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. HORWICH:

Yes, I think I know that.

I mean, we have this

15

concern -- obviously, we have a concern here that

16

without -- and this is detailed, very clearly, in the

17

complaint, I mean, I think starting with paragraph --

18

paragraph 8, that talks about some of the price -- some

19

of the pricing constraints.

20

paragraphs of the complaint, you have all these

21

descriptions of loss of quality competition here.

But you get on to the later

22

So you have -- you have --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

You are not understanding

24

my question, I guess.

You have to take as a given that,

25

even though what you say is true, I would find that this
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute clearly prohibits the application of the

2

antitrust laws to pricing decisions.

3

the authority.

4

That's the job of

Now, if I start with that, then you will

5

say, okay, I have to decide against you.

6

say, even so, I win because mergers are different.

7

that -- that's what I'm trying to get you to say.

8
9

MR. HORWICH:

Or you might
Now,

Yes, and I guess that is what

I'm -- I guess that is what I'm trying to say, is that

10

mergers are different because the challenged

11

anticompetitive act here is not a pricing decision by

12

the hospitals that --

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to ask you:

Why are

they different?

15

MR. HORWICH:

They are different --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

After all, we have, one,

17

the specific language I read; and, two, I can think of

18

examples where a merger would be anticompetitive under

19

the DOJ and your FTC rules --

20

MR. HORWICH:

Yeah.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and yet, probably would

22

further the purposes of the statute by lowering the

23

cost.

24

MR. HORWICH:

Well, that's --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you think that's the

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

null set?

2

I -- I don't think that's -MR. HORWICH:

No, I -- well, I don't -- I

3

don't know whether that is -- I don't know whether that

4

is true or not, but I think -- I think we're relying on

5

a more -- I think you can't simply start with the idea

6

that, well -- well, you can't start with the premise

7

that this act exists to pursue an objective and to

8

pursue it at any cost, without regard to whether it

9

displaces competition in the market for paid healthcare

10

services, without regard to whether it displaces

11

competition for quality among these hospitals.

12

I mean, on that logic -- and I -- I think it

13

might help to look at some of the other powers here.

14

we -- if you go to the back of the government's brief,

15

on page 6A, the authority has the power to make and --

16

and execute contracts.

17

implies a privilege to enter price-fixing contracts.

18

That's part of the background principles of antitrust

19

law.

20

Well, I don't think that that

I also don't think it implies the power to

21

enter contracts against public policy.

22

presumably, doesn't wish to abandon that background

23

principle, simply because it wants the authority to

24

pursue its mission.

25

If

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
16

Alderson Reporting Company

A State,

Well, you've already

Official

1

told us that there can be State action for some purposes

2

and not others.

3

MR. HORWICH:

Exactly.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the fact that you

5

have examples where you might conclude, no, they didn't

6

mean to do that, doesn't seem to categorically suggest

7

that you prevail with respect to another one of the

8

powers that are granted.

9

MR. HORWICH:

No, I agree with that, that it

10

doesn't categorically, but it does -- it does seem to me

11

that -- that if we're looking through this list of

12

powers that -- that the hospital authority has, there is

13

not anything meaningfully different about the power to

14

acquire -- acquire property versus make contracts

15

versus, as Justice Scalia said, any other powers that

16

are -- that exist in a general corporation's business

17

charter.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

completely wrong.

20

doubt that, in counties or municipalities of this size,

21

you are going to have -- you know, five hospitals, and

22

so that a -- the authority could acquire a hospital and

23

yet still it not have any significant merger

24

consequences on its face.

25

You can tell me.

I -- this may be
I would -- would

In other words, when this law was passed,
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

giving them the power to acquire hospitals, wasn't it

2

the case that there would likely be only one other

3

hospital or two, so that any acquisition of another

4

hospital would have the merger consequences that this

5

one had?

6

MR. HORWICH:

Well, no, because I think

7

the -- the baseline when the statute was enacted was

8

that the hospital authorities didn't even exist.

9

they didn't own any hospitals.

10

So

And the first acquisition of a hospital

11

can't raise a competitive concern because it's not

12

concentrating the market in any way.

13

transferring ownership of the hospital from one actor to

14

another.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's simply

Well, but to -- to follow

16

the Chief Justice's question, suppose it were shown that

17

there were many rural counties -- rural areas in

18

Georgia, very much like this one.

19

this case?

20

thrust of the question.

21

Would that change

I thought that was the purport of the -- the

MR. HORWICH:

I think you'd have to imagine

22

a very stylized hypothetical, to see that the State had

23

clearly intended to displace competition.

24

want to see, for example -- let me give you an

25

example -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I know Georgia has

158 counties or something.

3

MR. HORWICH:

Right.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So I think they probably

5

have many rural areas with one or two hospitals.

6

just a guess.

7

MR. HORWICH:

That's

Well, right, but I suppose

8

that -- that guesswork is not going to be a basis

9

for saying a State has clearly intended to displace

10
11

competition.
The situation in which I think you might

12

recognize it is, if the hospital authorities were

13

already in existence, but they -- and they all each

14

owned a hospital, but they had never had the power to

15

acquire a hospital, and you knew that they were all --

16

that each of them had their neighboring competitor, and

17

then the legislature comes in and says -- you know,

18

we -- we would like you now to actually be able to

19

acquire -- acquire additional hospitals.

20

I mean, the power here is not the power to

21

acquire additional hospitals.

But, if the legislature

22

had said, we have the power to acquire additional

23

hospitals and we know you already have one and we know

24

that the one you are going to acquire is going to be

25

your neighbor and we know there is not lots of hospitals

clear implication of that is that that's going --

21

of socializing all of the available resources under

No, I think those would likely

10

I want to be clear about --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. HORWICH:

How is that?

-- the point.

The point of

13

this law is to grant counties the opportunity to

14

participate in this market by providing care to

15

indigents.

16

This is not a law about public utility

17

regulation.

18

public utility regulation, that all hospitals

19

are supposed to be -- that the State intends counties to

20

be able to elect to put all hospitals under their

21

control and -- and manage them as such and manage them

22

in the way that a -- that a public service commission

23

would regulate all of the utilities --

24
25

If you think that this is a law about

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the language is

awfully similar to what you find in public utility
23

nobody is higher than a reasonable rate.

3

MR. HORWICH:

Well, this -- the authority

does not have the power to -- Justice Breyer, the

5

authority does not have the power to establish rates at

6

private hospitals.

7

difference between the -- the authority's power in

8

this -- in this case and the power of a public service

9

regulator over a -- over a utility.

10

And that -- that would be a signal

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what does it mean to

11

establish rates and charges for the services and use of

12

the facilities of the authority?

13

MR. HORWICH:

The facilities of the

14

authority, yes, but not other hospitals within the

15

jurisdiction.

16

the authority itself is -- is operating.

17

It's only -- it's only the hospitals that

And so -- so I guess we -- we also have

18

here -- I want -- I want to be clear that, in all of

19

this discussion, we are -- we are operating on the

20

premise that it's actually the authority itself that is

21

operating the hospital.

24
25

Of course, that is not what this case is.

13

And, in your answer, you

conceded that whether -- if -- if there is discretion,

15

it's not necessary to make it work because the -- the

16

authority can say yes or no -- it's not --

17

MR. HORWICH:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19
20

Exactly.
So what's your

definition of "necessity"?
MR. HORWICH:

Our definition -- our

21

definition -- well, I have to be honest with you, it's

22

hard to define it because it's going to arise in a

23

number of different contexts.

24

But what this -- but the times where this

25

Court has used it, it has -- it has used it to convey
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the idea that the choice that the State is offering is

2

no choice at all, if Federal law is going to come in;

3

that -- that Federal law would just negate the choice.

4

So to be concrete about this, in -- in

5

Hallie, for example, the choice that the State provided

6

at the end of kind of a complicated line of -- of

7

statutory rules about how -- how cities do or don't have

8

to provide their sewage treatments to -- to their

9

neighbors, at the end of the day the city had a choice

10

to say, fine, we will give you sewage treatment

11

services, but you have to be annexed to us and -- you

12

know, take the other things that come with annexation to

13

the city.

14

Now, if that choice is -- is -- if that

15

choice is anticompetitive, it's going to be taken away

16

by Federal law.

17

to offer is no choice at all.

18

and the only choice left for the -- the city in Hallie

19

is going to be to -- to opt --

And the choice that the State has tried

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. HORWICH:

22
23

It's going to be negated,

If the State -To just relent and get the

2

specificity that's necessary as to the particular

3

anticompetitive conduct that the State wants to cover?
MR. HORWICH:

4

Or is there a degree of

Well, I think, in your

5

hypothetical, we are imagining kind of a municipality

6

enabling act that just has -- you know, a section in it

7

that says, municipalities shall enjoy the State's

8

exemption from the -JUSTICE ALITO:

9
10
11

Well, Georgia does seem to have such

a statute.
MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

So -- so that -- that's

12

not a clear articulation problem because it's plenty

13

clear what the State's trying to do.

14

There might be what I would call an

15

affirmative expression problem there because simply

16

saying that the State doesn't want the antitrust laws to

17

apply, that's not the basis in federalism for the -- for

18

the State Action Doctrine.

19

The basis in federalism is that the State

20

has made some affirmative choice that it wants to

21

accomplish something else, and that it's offered some

22

principle on which the sub-State actors can -- can act

23

to serve the State's policy interests.

24

And so I think you might have to hesitate in

25

a case like that to say, well, if the -- if the State is

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just passing out indulgences to -- to get out of Federal

2

competition law, that may not be something that,

3

substantively, Federal law will stand aside for.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't want to take

5

up your rebuttal time, but I don't see how that's

6

consistent with your answer to Justice Kagan about a

7

grant of discretionary authority.

9

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I -- I was assuming, in

Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that we had some of the

10

other things going on here that -- that manifested a

11

particular objective that the State was trying to

12

pursue.

13

So sort of the State trying to pursue

14

municipal governance doesn't seem to me to be enough of

15

an affirmative State policy to say that works.

16

think that would distinguish the two.

17

And if I could reserve?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the specific area of local hospital
services, the Georgia legislature has adopted a model of
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

local public choice, including the choice to reduce or

2

eliminate competition.

3

There is no issue here, Justice Scalia, with

4

respect to your earlier question, of general corporate

5

powers.

6

public authorities to, quote, "exercise public and

7

essential government functions to provide hospital care

8

for residents, especially residents who cannot pay.

9

empowers authorities to acquire projects" -- plural --

The Hospital Authorities Law creates local

It

10

"specifically including each authority the ability to

11

acquire hospitals" -- plural -- but with limitations.

12

They have to -- it has to be within a very

13

confined geographic and demographic jurisdiction.

14

for authority hospitals, it replaces any pure market

15

model with statutory mandates, a mandate to provide

16

services to all indigent in the community and to price

17

all services on a not-for-profit basis and with a

18

statutory limitation on rate of return.

19

There are --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I -- I don't see how

21

any of that pertains to whether they can create a

22

hospital monopoly.

23

you are not the only hospital in the area.

24
25

And

You can do all of that, even though

MR. WAXMAN:

The -- I guess my point here is

that the -- that the legislature's -- the powers that
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the -- the legislature has given hospital authorities

2

are not, by any means, general corporate powers.

3

are broader than what a corporation may have in certain

4

respects and much narrower in other respects.

5

And they --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They

Well, but the only respect

7

relevant here is -- is -- the only respect relevant is

8

the ability to acquire other hospitals.

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

That's right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right?

And there is --

And that's -- and

11

that's a general corporate power.

12

Georgia has the power to acquire, including acquire

13

other businesses.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Every corporation in

There -- there -- these --

15

these are -- the supervening wish, mandate, of the

16

legislature -- and this is well-explained in Georgia

17

Supreme Court cases, particularly DeJarnette, which was

18

decided right after Georgia amended its constitution,

19

enacted the Hospital Authorities Law -- was the desire

20

to -- the goal to provide adequate hospital services,

21

particularly for the indigent --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Georgia wasn't so sure

23

because didn't it come in originally on the side of the

24

FTC in this case?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

It did.

And Georgia's

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

complaint and its theory in the district court, which it

2

did not pursue in the court of appeals or here, not --

3

was not that the authorities weren't exercising State

4

power, but that the contention that the operation of the

5

hospital by the -- the special purpose corporations that

6

the hospital authority created was not adequately

7

supervised.

8
9

That is what the State was arguing in the
district court.

And when it lost that point, it

10

withdrew from the case and has remained absent ever

11

since.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, we do have a

13

brief from quite a number of States, and the brief

14

basically says, we do this all the time, we set up these

15

local authorities, and then we give them powers because

16

they have to act in the world, and we give them normal

17

powers, like the ability to make contracts and the

18

ability to buy property.

19

And when we do that, we don't mean that they

20

can do anything they want, notwithstanding the antitrust

21

laws.

22

would give to a State entity, in order to allow it to

23

operate as a permission to violate the antitrust laws,

24

is not at all consistent with our own intentions.

25

And to construe these very normal powers that we

MR. WAXMAN:

I -- I have no problem with the
31


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

amicus brief filed by the States supporting the FTC in

2

this case, which is positive, quite expressly and at the

3

outset, on an understanding that what is involved here

4

is simply a State authorization of creation of a local

5

entity with general corporate powers and nothing more.

6

That could not be farther from this case.

7

These special purpose authorities do not simply have

8

general corporate powers.

9

is a Georgia constitutional amendment that coincided

They have a mandate.

There

10

with the enactment of the Hospital Authorities Law that

11

derogated the State's duty to provide indigent care

12

to its -- hospital care to its citizens.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I'm -Well, is it a fair

15

characterization of your argument -- is it a fair

16

characterization of your argument to say that the

17

possibility that the hospital authority can use this

18

general power in this way is tantamount to or equivalent

19

to the legislature intending that it be used that way?

20

Is that your argument?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

We take seriously the

22

standard that this Court announced in self-consciously

23

clarifying the level of explicitness that a legislature

24

has to use in Town of Hallie.

25

This Court said -- the Court asked whether,
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

quote, "suppression of competition was a foreseeable

2

result of what the State legislature authorized," and it

3

derived that formulation expressly from its earlier

4

decision in City of Lafayette, which explained that a,

5

quote, "adequate State mandate exists when it can

6

reasonably be inferred," quote, "from the authority

7

given a local entity to operate in a given area that the

8

legislature contemplated the kind of action complained

9

of."

10

In other words, as I understand this Court's

11

test, whether what was done by the hospital authority or

12

any sub-State entity was foreseeable by a reasonable

13

legislator, which in this case is that -- was it

14

foreseeable that in -- in pursuing the State-imposed

15

mandate to serve the indigent in a -- in a confined

16

jurisdiction, especially in rural counties which abound

17

in Georgia, a hospital authority might require market

18

power or even a public service monopoly because that --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21
22

Could you --

-- is the natural way to acquit

the statutory mandate.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's -- there is a

23

problem here, which is, I understand the public mandate

24

to serve the indigent, but you are asking us to take

25

this a step further.

You're elevating that public
33


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mandate to a public command, that serving the indigent

2

has to override the needs of the majority, in terms of

3

price competition.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't -- I don't -And -- and that -- that

6

step -- that further step that the State intended to

7

immunize their -- the monopoly power, is the step we are

8

trying to find in this grant.

9

see.

And that's what I don't

I see the -- the compulsion to serve the needy.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Uh-huh.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I hear that much of

12

Georgia is rural, but your adversary says, in most

13

instances, there is only one hospital, so the

14

municipality's taking it over is not going to be a

15

merger issue.

16

over one of two hospitals, there is no merger issue

17

because it's only substituting one owner for another.

18

To the extent that they step in and take

This situation, they claim, is a rarity,

19

where there are only two or three providers and a

20

hospital's going to -- and a public -- a municipality is

21

going to then get monopoly power by an acquisition.

22

MR. WAXMAN:

So, Justice Sotomayor, as to

23

your first point, our position is not that the only

24

mandate is to serve the indigent.

25

the constitution and the Hospital Authorities Law is to
34

Alderson Reporting Company

The actual mandate in

provide hospital services for all residents, with a

2

particular note to the obligation to serve indigent

3

clients.

4

Second of all, we are not here to -- I mean,

5

I don't know where the government is coming up with its

6

speculation that, out of Georgia's -- I think it's 154

7

counties, for a population of 10 million people, it is

8

the rare instance in which there will be anything other

9

than just one or -- you know, a multiplicity of

10

hospitals.

11

guidelines for market concentration is anything up to

12

four, four or fewer participants.

13

I mean, the Federal Trade Commission

The notion that the legislature, in 1941,

14

was providing the express authority to acquire multiple

15

hospitals in a single municipality or county was focused

16

only on huge metropolises, of which there was only one,

17

or on counties that were so small that they couldn't

18

otherwise even attempt to support more than one hospital

19

is just fanciful; it's made up.

20

And --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, could -- could I

22

understand where you think this expressed approval is

23

coming from?

24

is not enough.

25

you said, is insufficient.

Because you said general corporate powers
So the general ability to buy property,

Then you have this idea they have a mission.

2

But the mission can be accomplished in all kinds of ways

3

that are perfectly consistent with the antitrust laws,

4

so that doesn't seem to get you all that far.

5

So what else have you got to show that the

6

State actually thought about this issue and approved

7

this power for the hospital authorities?

8
9

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

I mean, for one -- one

other thing is in Section 7 -- 7-77, as -- as was noted

10

before, the authorities are subject to regulation of

11

rate of return.

12

foreseeable consequence of market power, I don't know

13

what -- what does.

14

public service monopoly or at least the regulation of a

15

return by a participant with market power.

16

Now, if that doesn't bespeak the

That is the hallmark of a regulated

The other thing that exists -- and the

17

government pooh-poohs this as somehow not part of the

18

Hospital Authorities Law -- is that the Georgia State

19

legislature has -- this is -- this law was enacted in

20

the backdrop of other laws in which Georgia has quite

21

deliberately displaced, quote, "unfettered private

22

market competition."

23

The certificate of need law is the

24

paradigmatic example of the imposition of regulation at

25

the expense of free market competition and, in fact -
36

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, a lot of States have

2

that.

You can't open a new hospital without getting a

3

certificate of need.

4

those, States the -- the result is that the antitrust

5

laws can be ignored?

6

Are you saying that, in all of

MR. WAXMAN:

No, no, no.

Our argument is

7

not that the certificate -- that the existence of a

8

certificate of need law indicates an intent by the

9

legislature to fully displace the antitrust laws with

10

respect to anybody else.

11

My point is, in the context of other Georgia

systems that strictly limit entry into -- or expansion

restrictions and obligations and mandates to serve --

what is now being challenged.

there was a public hospital, beginning in 1911, in

Dougherty County.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. WAXMAN:

So when the hospital --

Yes.

When the State constitution was

amended to impose on counties the State's obligation to

7

provide adequate hospitalization care, it enacted the

8

Hospital Authority Law for counties that chose to make

9

use of that device, in order to acquit their public

service mandate.

11

And Dougherty County did, soon thereafter --

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

-- establish a -- an authority,

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

These were a group of

5

people that ran some hospitals -- some municipal

6

hospitals, and now, they can acquire, not just

7

general -- I agree with you, it isn't just general.

8

They have a lot of power there to acquire other

9

hospitals from outside the system.

10

But, when they do that, there's no reason to

11

think that that gives them the power to acquire it,

12

where it's anticompetitive.

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think that --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, the fact that you can

15

regulate your own hospitals, which is one track and one

16

group, doesn't say that you have to bring in

17

anticompetitive people -- I mean, you have to bring in

18

others, where they're anticompetitive.

22

Yes.
Don't think of it as one

thing; think of it as two separate systems.

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

I know that.

But

3

once you don't -- once you don't -- he says, you see,

4

they don't regulate prices at non-authority hospitals,

5

they don't do this for non-authority, they don't do that

6

for non-authority, even though they might have the power

7

to bring them in; but, when they have the power to bring

them in, why read this -- it's at least ambiguous -- why

read this as saying you can bring them in, where it's

is really more fundamental, which is, yes, I understand

9

that you have a great defense, potentially, to a rule of

reason challenge that -- that there was necessity in its

11

truest sense, in its economic sense, in this situation.

12

So why should we undo our decades of

13

writings that say that we should construe immunity

14

narrowly and not broadly, when it comes to displacing

15

our antitrust laws?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

Because the point of State

17

action immunity, which is respect for the sovereign

18

choices of sovereign States, is -- exists not only to

19

provide a -- an ultimate defense in litigation on the

20

merits, it's to protect States and sub-State entities

21

from the cost of litigating.

22

I mean, the question, ultimately, in this

case -- and in all these cases -- is who gets to decide?

Who gets to decide if this is reasonable or not?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, I mean, that's

5

right, it is about choices, but -- but the question is

6

whether the State has made a choice.

7

all these cases are about --

MR. WAXMAN:

10

I think it's the

The context of the law as a whole here --

11

and I hope this works for the Court, but if it

12

doesn't -- you know, perhaps I am wrong; it certainly

13

makes this a stronger case than Hallie -- here, we have

14

a law that says counties have the obligation now, unlike

15

the State, to provide adequate hospitalization services.

16

They will exercise -- what they do is deemed

17

to exercise public and essential government function

18

within strictly limited areas.

19

to acquire hospitals in those areas, subject to very

20

strict rate of return regulations and very, very strict

21

conditions on how they operate those hospitals,

22

including the power to lease to an operator for -- in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. WAXMAN:

And they do this in a backdrop

of a State that has -- notwithstanding the advocacy of

the Federal Trade Commission, has repeatedly

strengthened, rather than abrogated, a -- a certificate

of need law that leads --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, you are

10

essentially interpreting the Georgia statute that sets

11

up the hospital authority.

12

this is how we read it.

13

exemption is for the State, not subdivisions, so the

14

State has to give it to the subdivision, for the

15

subdivision to have it.

16

And you -- you're saying

We start with the antitrust

Could the Federal court have said,

17

we -- we'd like to know what the Georgia legislature --

18

what the Georgia authorities think this statute means?

19

So, could a question have been certified -- I don't know

20

if Georgia has a certification procedure, but to the

21

Georgia Supreme Court, and said, tell us, does this

22

statute, is it intended to transfer the State's immunity

23

to the locality -- to the local unit?

24
25

MR. WAXMAN:

I don't -- I mean, I -- I

assume that the Georgia State courts could do that; but,
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Ginsburg, I think it's important to recognize

2

that the FTC doesn't dispute that the -- that hospital

3

authority -- county hospital authorities are, in fact,

4

agents or arms of the State --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the question is does

6

this -- does this legislature mean that the State is

7

transferring its immunity to this local unit?

8
9

MR. WAXMAN:

And I believe the FTC --

Mr. Horwich can correct me if I'm wrong -- but I believe

10

the FTC's position is, generally, yes, but not with

11

respect to the -- what is alleged to be a merger to

12

monopoly.

13

And the question in this case is whether or

14

not the acts, under this law and applying the

15

foreseeable result standard, whether the acts of the

16

hospital authority in this case in approving and

17

acquiring the second hospital are fairly attributable to

18

the State.

19

And if I could just --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Waxman, if you don't

21

want to be interrupted, you have to pause between

22

sentences.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. WAXMAN:

25

I was taking a cue from Your

Honor the last argument.
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand.

That's

right.

3

You've given a -- you know, an appealing

4

example of a small county that has one -- one hospital,

5

and this operation purchases that one -- one hospital.

6

Seems nothing wrong with that; although, as Justice

7

Sotomayor suggests, I doubt whether the FTC would be

8

pursuing a situation in which there is a natural

9

monopoly.

10
11

It's a question of whether the monopoly would

be owned by the State or not.
But your argument, if we follow it, embraces

12

a quite different situation, a very large county which

13

has five hospitals that are competing vigorously in

14

price, in specialties, they advertise on the radio, as

15

some hospitals do.

16

And what you're saying is that this

17

operation can take over all of those hospitals and

18

eliminate all of that competition.

19

MR. WAXMAN:

Isn't that so?

Well, I -- for purposes of

20

Federal antitrust law, yes.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

But for purposes of State law,

almost certainly no.

is the point here.

through both private suits and actions authorized by its

MR. WAXMAN:

We have no -- we have no

Oh, yes, we do.
And we have a Federal

antitrust law.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

We -- we absolutely do,

10

Justice Scalia.

There is a solid line of cases in which

11

the Georgia Supreme Court has -- has quite rigorously

12

enforced the limitations of the Hospital Authority Law,

13

in order to prevent hospital authorities from doing

14

things that it says the legislature didn't intend.

15

Tift County case is the best example, but there are

16

others cited in our brief.

17

The last point --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:
I don't understand.

The

Why -- why didn't it intend

19

this?

20

they did intend this, that they did intend to displace

21

competition.

22

MR. WAXMAN:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you've told us that

Yes.
And now, you say, but

24

Georgia will say, oh, no, they didn't intend to displace

25

competition.

Official

1

MR. WAXMAN:

No, no, no.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. WAXMAN:

My --

Which is it?

My point is that, with respect

4

to your hypothetical, whether the hospital authority of

5

Fulton County -- and I believe there is more than one

6

hospital authority in Fulton County, and they are

7

authorized to merge, in any event -- but could they

8

acquire, by purchase or eminent domain, all of the

9

hospitals in metropolitan Atlanta to do so?

And my

10

point is that for purposes of Federal antitrust law the

11

answer is you are out -- that's -- you are not the

12

authority to inquire.

13

The question is -- just as this Court -- you

14

explained for the Court in Omni, there may be very many

15

things that a local authority can do that would violate

16

State law, and there are State law remedies.

17

point only was that the Georgia Supreme Court has been

18

very quick to enforce the limitations.

19

And my

But as a matter of Federal antitrust law,

20

the only question is were they -- were they authorized

21

to do things like this?

22

And if I --

JUSTICE BREYER:

And they -- they say on

23

that, that it's a sham.

Well, just say 30 seconds on

24

their argument, that the FTC looked into it, these

25

people had never regulated anything, they'd never looked
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

at any price anywhere, they've never done a single

2

thing, it's a sham; and therefore, that's the end of it.

3

What about that?

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

If I can just finish my

5

answer to Justice -- I have one other point to make

6

for -- to Justice Kagan, who has asked it twice.

7

The -- my last point I want to make -- and

8

then I will answer this -- is that this county -- this

9

hospital authority, like many, facing a capacity

10

constraint and a -- and a nondiscretionary mandate to

11

serve the public needs for hospitalization, had two

12

choices.

13

It could have tried to convince the State to

14

spend three times as much money to get half the number

15

of beds, notwithstanding the existence of excess

16

capacity; or it could buy the other hospital and get

17

that capacity in a consensual transaction by the

18

authority.

19

And here's my point, Justice Scalia, this

20

case is on all fours with this Court's decision in Omni.

21

The notion that this may have long been desired by

22

this -- this special-purpose entity is totally

23

irrelevant.

24

considered by, and -- and approved by the hospital

25

authority.

This -- this acquisition was proposed to,

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And not only that, when the FTC came and

2

complained about it, they reconvened another public

3

meeting and discussed it again and came to the

4

conclusion again that they wanted to acquire this

5

hospital.

6

And before they signed the lease, they

7

issued a notice and comment period.

8

months for people to tell the authority whether this

9

lease was or was not consistent with community

10

interests.

11

it.

12

There was three

They had a public meeting, and they approved

And that is the act of the State.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can the State --

13

does the State have a procedure where it can give

14

real-time approval?

15

and the hospital authority says, boy, the FTC is sending

16

us these letters.

17

that you approve this transaction, whether it's a

18

special law or there is some organization, I guess, in

19

some other case, setup, that could give its approval?

In other words, this is going on,

State, could you do something to show

20

Is there --

21

MR. WAXMAN:

I mean, this is -- the Hospital

22

Authorities Law says, counties, this is your

23

responsibility, here are your powers.

24

State or any competitor or the attorney general thinks

25

that you are abusing those statutory powers, the courts
52

Alderson Reporting Company

If anybody in the

Official

1

are open and quite receptive to those concerns.

2

there's no --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I know.

But

But I

4

guess my point is can the burden of going forward be

5

switched the other way?

6

say -- you know, to the State, we would like some

7

blessing on this, so that we can go ahead with it?

And can this hospital authority

8

So the choices aren't really build your own

9

hospital or acquire the other one, in the abstract, but

10

ask the State -- you know, what do you want us to do?

11

Do you want us to build a new hospital?

12

if we acquire this one?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Or is it okay

I don't believe there is any

14

such mechanism, and I believe that the -- the State --

15

the legislature didn't contemplate anything like that,

16

because the mandate and the responsibility and the

17

authorization was devolved to the counties.

18

Now, Mr. Chief Justice, what the -- what the

19

hospital authority could do and did do, although it's

20

not in the record of this case, is evaluate the

21

likelihood of getting a certificate of need to build the

22

additional required facilities.

9

think they are insufficient.

Where can you locate this intent to displace

And I would like to just

So the first one, of course, we've talked a

11

lot about the existence of general corporate powers, but

12

the most natural inference there is that the State

13

expects those to be exercised in conformity with the

14

background principles that anybody else who has general

15

powers has.

16

Now, the idea that the authority has a

mandate, a purpose it's supposed to serve, of course,

18

that's always true.

mind when they set up some sub-State entity.

20

question isn't whether there is particular ends the

21

State is trying to pursue.

22

And see Mr. Waxman also pointed to the rate of

return provision in the statute.

3

threshold matter, there's -- if past is prologue, there

4

is not any reason to think that that will be not be

5

rigorously enforced with respect to the privately

7

the second question presented, and we can set that aside

8

for the moment, I guess.

9

Now, as a sort of a

But -- and that's sort of

But it seems to me there are two far more

10

natural explanations for the presence of the rate of

11

return provision in the statute than the one Mr. Waxman

12

would like you to -- to give to it.

13

The first explanation is this is a statute

14

about providing public care for indigents.

15

should be making a profit off of that, and the State

16

wants to say that.

17

explanation that doesn't depend at all on the State

18

intending to displace competition completely.

19

Nobody

And that seems to be a very natural

The -- the rate -- the price regulation

20

provision also can be naturally understood as a response

21

to the recognition that there will be some de facto

22

monopolies in the situation where there is only one

23

hospital in the county.

24
25

But it does not mean that the State wants
there to be more monopolies, so that it can bring in the

those.

Well, the -- the --

I -- I don't think the two are entirely -- are entirely

separable, as a matter of competition law, because the

2

reason the competition law is concerned with mergers is

3

not because of the transaction as such, but it's because

4

of what it does going forward to the structure of the

5

market and the competitive behavior of those in the

6

market.

7

And so the State Action Doctrine says that

8

the State -- if the State's going to go create monopoly,

9

it needs to take ownership of that monopoly.

And I'm

10

using ownership not in the literal sense, but at least

11

ownership in the sense of actively supervising the

12

monopoly, to be sure that it is pursuing the -- the

13

objectives that the State has in mind for creating it.

14

So that's -- that's why we are still concerned there.

15

Mr. Waxman referred to the Certificate of

minimum fee schedules agreed to by lawyers.

of -- the State of Virginia regulated entry into the

20

market for the practice of law, just as the certificate

21

of need regulates entry into the hospital market.

22

I think there is a very close analogy to be
That is the -- the question of
The State

But horizontal agreements among people

23

already in the market, such as here and such as the

24

minimum fee schedule in Goldfarb, are not exempt just

25

because of it.
