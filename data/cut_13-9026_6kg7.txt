Whitfield v. United States.

 Mr. Carpenter. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA B. CARPENTER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. CARPENTER: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, 
and may it please the Court: 
 The basic bank robbery offense under 

12

Section 2113(a) requires the robber to use force, 

13

intimidation or violence against another person. 

14

Section (e)'s forced accompaniment provision is designed 

15

for much more extreme conduct that Congress viewed as 

16

roughly on par with murder.  And yet the government 

17

would have that provision and its tenyear mandatory 

18

minimum apply any time that a robber forces someone to 

19

take a single step with him in the course of a robbery. 

20

 That single step rule isn't justified by the 

21

text of the statute, and it isn't necessary to ensure 

22

just punishment for bank robbers.  In this case 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why isn't it justified by 

the text? 
 MR. CARPENTER: 

Your Honor, it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

justified by the text, first 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I can  I can accompany 

3

my  my wife to her table when we go to a dinner party, 

4

and we're  we're seated at different tables.  Isn't 

5

isn't it proper to say I accompany her to the table? 

6

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Your Honor, our view is not 

7

that it is technically improper, but that it is  it 

8

would not be an ordinary and natural usage of the word 

9

"accompany," for example, to say 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: There is, I just gave you an 

11

ordinary and natural use.  I accompanied my wife to her 

12

table. 

13

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Our view is that it is not 

14

an ordinary usage to say were you accompanied, for 

15

example, from this side of the lectern to this side, 

16

which is the amount of movement the government believes 

17

is  is covered.  Or, for example, to say, will you 

18

accompany me, Justice Scalia, from your chair down to 

19

yours. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You  you think there's a 

21

spatial component to  I mean, what  I don't 

22

understand why you say it's  it's not normal usage, 

23

unless you say there is a spatial requirement that 

24

you  to accompany somebody, you have to walk a longer 

25

distance, and I  the example I just gave you suggests 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5

2

otherwise.
 MR. CARPENTER: 

Your Honor, our view of 

3

the  in the ordinary usage it is used in the sense of 

4

going to a destination, to the theater, to the ballpark. 

5

But even if there is some question 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 MR. CARPENTER: 

To my wife's table. 
Well, even if there is some 

8

question about whether the usage of just a movement of a 

9

few feet is an ordinary usage, where there are multiple, 

10

possible meanings of a term, we look to the statutory 

11

context and the statutory structure 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm asking you whether 

13

there are multiple possible  listen, I'm very big on 

14

the rule of lenity, but the condition for it is that 

15

there be ambiguity.  And accompany means accompany.  I 

16

don't see any spatial component to it. 

17

 MR. CARPENTER: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, Your Honor 
And the rule here is, you 

19

know, garbage in, garbage out.  It may be a very foolish 

20

statute.  But  but we apply what  what Congress 

21

thought was not foolish. 

22

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, Justice Scalia, first, 

23

whether there's ambiguity is determined not by looking 

24

at the word "accompany" in isolation.  But as the Court 

25

said last year in the Utility Air context  or in the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

Utility Air case, the words of the statute are

2

interpreted in their context and with a view towards 

3

their place in the statutory scheme.  Here the place 

4

that the word "accompany" serves in the statutory scheme 

5

is to set off a set of extreme conduct that Congress 

6

viewed as roughly on par with murder.  Its association 

7

in Section (e) with the killing offense tells us under 

8

the Noscitur principle that Congress viewed a forced 

9

accompaniment as akin to murder. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20 steps  20 steps is 

11

horrible enough for Congress to have believed it's 

12

enough of an accompaniment?  What?  Half a mile?  What? 

13

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well,  we don't 

14

believe there's going to be a brightline rule based on 

15

the number of steps or the number of feet. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't insist on a 

17

brightline rule.  I insist on some rule.  What 

18

what is your  what is your rule?  Does it have to be 

19

outside the building?  Does  does the bank robber have 

20

to take the person as a hostage outside the building? 

21

 MR. CARPENTER: 

We think the best way to 

22

effectuate the structure of the scheme is to have a 

23

finding of substantiality.  And we would instruct a jury 

24

or a factfinder in our Rule 29 motion, first and 

25

foremost, to say that a substantial movement is 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

something more than a de minimus or a trivial movement.

2

If the district court or this Court wants to go further 

3

than that, we believe that the court  the jury 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's a  that's a 

5

very different rule than in your brief.  I could buy a 

6

de minimis rule, but I don't know where you get the word 

7

"substantial." 

8
9
10
11
12
13

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Your Honor, we believe that 

"substantial" is  is implied in the structure.  Again, 
looking at first the Noscitur 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Let's say we disagree. 

Where would you find "de minimis"? 
 MR. CARPENTER: 

If you disagree with that, 

14

then I think you would look  you could just apply a de 

15

minimis principle and say that movement of just a few 

16

feet within a person's own home is 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MR. CARPENTER: 

How much is a few feet? 
Well, in this case, it's 

19

about 4 to 9 feet, which is approximately from where 

20

you're sitting, Justice Sotomayor, to where you're 

21

sitting, Justice Scalia.  That is approximately 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I thought the record was 

different.  I thought the record was 14 to 20? 
 MR. CARPENTER: 

It's not.  The government in 

its brief asserts that it is 20 feet from the front door 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8

2
3
4

of the house 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  8  no.  I 

was right.  Go ahead. 
 MR. CARPENTER: 

If you look at the  the 

5

government asserts that it was 20 feet from the front 

6

door all the way back to the room.  But, first, the 

7

record also suggests that she was  met Mr. 

8

Mr. Whitfield while she was coming out of the hallway. 

9

So the movement wasn't the 20 feet from the front door. 

10

It was from the threshold of the hallway into the 

11

computer room. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is it contextual? 

13

In other words, is 20 feet in her home different from 

14

20 feet in the bank? 

15

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Yes.  Well, I think 20 feet 

16

all within a single building is almost never going to 

17

qualify because that cannot be so significantly 

18

different from the conduct that is covered by an 

19

ordinary (a) offense that Congress would have viewed it 

20

as extreme enough to justify a tenyear mandatory 

21

minimum penalty. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But it seems  the 

23

reason I ask is that it  it strikes me that it makes a 

24

difference if it's in part of the robbery itself.  I 

25

mean, it seems to me to tell the teller to go to the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

vault or something.  That's what happens in a bank

2

robbery.  If on the other hand, the  the defendant 

3

takes the teller from the bank to the car and then, you 

4

know, they  they block the car, that strikes me as 

5

something different even though the distance might be 

6

the same. 

7

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, you're right and we 

8

agree with you on the  that it is a contextual 

9

inquiry.  So taking the  the person out of the bank 

10
11

and into the car is very likely going to qualify. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Except that the statute 

12

says "both in the course of or in fleeing from."  So it 

13

obviously envisions an accompaniment in the course of 

14

the bank robbery, doesn't it? 

15

 MR. CARPENTER: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The answer is yes, right? 

17

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, that language in our 

I  I believe 

18

view would be satisfied by the hypothetical  or by 

19

the  not a hypothetical  by an actual case that we 

20

see in Wilson, for example, which is cited in the 

21

government's brief where the bank robber goes to a bank 

22

employee's home, forces them to come with him from their 

23

home to the bank to facilitate the robbery.  That's 

24

absolutely an accompaniment in the commission of the 

25

offense.  I don't think anything in the statute suggests 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

that there must be some category of accompaniment within

2

the walls of the bank only. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If the test is  if the 

4

test is that there must be something that's substantial, 

5

how would you instruct the jury? 

6

 MR. CARPENTER: 

We would instruct the jury 

7

first to say it must be more than de minimus or trivial 

8

movement.  You could go further than that and ask the 

9

jury to consider factors such as the amount of distance 

10

that was covered, whether the person was moved into or 

11

out of a bank or another building and whether they were 

12

ultimately transported to a different place or location 

13

than where they were found. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But your first  when you 

15

just said it's not de minimis, is that your primary 

16

argument?  You just want a nonde minimis rule? 

17

 MR. CARPENTER: 

We believe that resolves 

18

this case.  Yes.  We think that  as we use 

19

"substantial" in the briefs, it is the flip side of de 

20

minimis.  So we think that de minimis is what happened 

21

here.  Movement with  inside a person's own home only 

22

for a few feet is de minimis.  We think the way to 

23

effectuate that 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The woman died from a heart 

attack, didn't she?  That wasn't de minimis. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

 MR. CARPENTER: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.
And  and part of what 

3

frightened her may have been the  the fact that your 

4

client forced her to go from one room to another. 

5

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, Justice Scalia, there 

6

is no doubt this is a tragic and sad case, but 

7

Section 2113(e) provides a mechanism for the government 

8

to hold Mr. Whitfield directly responsible 

9
10
11
12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 
 MR. CARPENTER: 

But why wouldn't it be 
 for the fact that she 

passed away. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Why wouldn't it be 

13

substantial when you go from one room to another?  Why 

14

doesn't that satisfy the definition of substantial? 

15
16
17

 MR. CARPENTER: 

The reason for that, I 

think, is if you look at the structure 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I mean, we're  we're 

18

looking for  for guidelines here.  So if you go from 

19

one room to another, that's arguably substantial. 

20

 MR. CARPENTER: 

I think the problem with 

21

that interpretation, Justice Kennedy, is that it sweeps 

22

in so many (a) offenses because the movement of just a few 

23

feet inside the bank, as Justice  as Mr. Chief Justice 

24

referred to, happens frequently.  Congress, in setting 

25

up Section (e) as an aggravated offense that requires a 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

tenyear mandatory minimum, and that at the time it was

2

passed, required 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't think that a few 

4

feet from a cash register to a vault  I've actually 

5

never seen the vault.  It's usually locked away behind 

6

the main area, so that's going to be another room, and 

7

it's going to be not necessarily a short distance. 

8
9

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, the  the typical 

bank robbery happens in branch offices which are 

10

probably half the size of this courtroom, so I don't 

11

believe it's going to be 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I can see  I think the 

13

statistics that we were shown is that the vast majority 

14

of bank robberies are at the counter, that people are 

15

not moved at all. 

16

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, we don't know the 

17

latter aspect of that in that no one  including the 

18

government under the current iteration of the U.S. 

19

Attorneys' Manual before this case  has been looking 

20

at the question of whether a person was moved a single 

21

step  again, from this side of the lectern to that, 

22

from this side of the counter to that  in the course 

23

of the bank robbery.  But we know if the  if this 

24

Court 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

This case  this case 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

didn't involve a single step.  But you say whatever it

2

was, nine feet, it's de minimis.  If you are right about 

3

that, then this charge never should have gone to the 

4

jury because is  is the jury supposed to say what is 

5

de minimis or is the judge supposed to say that? 

6

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, the judge will always 

7

address that in the first instance under a Rule 29 

8

motion.  But, Justice Ginsburg, you are absolutely 

9

correct.  Our view is that this should not have went to 

10
11
12
13

the jury on the forced accompaniment count. 
 But I would return to Justice Scalia's 
question 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Now, you  you say there 

14

is  there is no proper instruction to a jury that 

15

would allow this case to go to the jury? 

16
17
18

 MR. CARPENTER: 

That is correct.  We do 

not 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That isn't de minimis. 

19

That's  I mean, don't you accompany a person as well 

20

when you stay with them in the room, and did he? 

21

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, the  the government 

22

even agrees with us here that this isn't a confinement 

23

statute, and that goes back to the 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Wait.  So  so a person 

does it make no difference that they  they take the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

teller or they take the woman, you walk ten feet down to

2

a room, he says, sit there, and he stays with her to 

3

make certain that she won't pop her head up so someone 

4

can see?  I think that's probably what happened here. 

5

All right.  If that's what happened here, the 

6

accompaniment was not just walking, it was also staying 

7

and walking back perhaps. 

8

 MR. CARPENTER: 

9

The problem, Justice Breyer, 

is that that converts this into a confinement provision, 

10

and Congress pointedly did not write a confinement 

11

provision.  We know first that accompany, by its 

12

dictionary definition that the government agrees with, 

13

means to go with, not to stay with. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's  a very peculiar 

15

statute.  You kidnap a victim as a hostage.  You walk 

16

them two feet into the car.  You quickly disguise the 

17

car and have them lie on the floor, and  and that 

18

isn't covered by the statute.  Or you have outside, I 

19

don't know, there is a closet, you go, you walk them in, 

20

and push them in the closet, that is not covered.  It is 

21

covered if you  if you go 30 feet down the corridor 

22

with somebody else.  I can't  I don't understand, 

23

then, how this statute 

24

 MR. CARPENTER: 

25

I will agree with you that 

Congress could have written a much more precise statute 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

here, but we think that it  given the penalty

2

 structure and the increased tenyear mandatory minimum 

3

 that would apply here in so many bank robbery cases 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I'm not so sure 

5

 what  if you were going to draft the statute to reach 

6

 some of this conduct where people are forced to 

7

 accompany the robber, how would you have done it? 

8
9

 MR. CARPENTER: 

I think if Congress wanted 

 to adopt the government's interpretation of this 

10

 statute, it should have said forces someone to accompany 

11

 him for any distance whatsoever.  Because that modifies 

12

 the word accompany which, in our view, in its ordinary 

13

 usage implies something more than the movement of a single 

14

 step.

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

In an ordinary use it 

16

 doesn't.  Justice Scalia gave one example.  Suppose I 

17

 were to say, the nurse accompanied a patient as she 

18

 walked around the Intensive Care Unit.  That's an 

19

 ordinary use of the  of "accompanied." 

20

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, again, we don't 

21

 disagree that it's a permissible usage.  We  for the 

22

 reasons set out in the brief  don't think that it is 

23

 ordinary usage, and we certainly don't think it is 

24

 ordinary in the way that Congress used it. 

25

 Again, if you look at the usages of the word 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

 "accompany" in the code in 1934, Congress never used it

2

 to cover this type of short distance movement.  It's 

3

 also consistent with this Court's usages in the 1930s 

4

 which they  virtually all of them in the 1930s 

5

 referred to long distance movements.  And we think that 

6

 is consistent with the structure of the statute 

7
8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Because that was evident 

 from the rest of the statute, right? 

9

 MR. CARPENTER: 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And I think it's 
I mean, all the statutes 

11

 you cite, they make it clear that  that you are 

12

 talking about accompanying over a long distance, 

13

 kidnapping or whatever else.  But here there's no such 

14

 indication, and presumably where  where you have an 

15

 indication in some statutes, you do not have it here, it 

16

 presumably does not apply here. 

17

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, Justice Scalia, I 

18

 disagree with you that we don't have the other 

19

 indications in this statute, and I would start with the 

20

 noscitur principle under Section (e).  Congress put 

21

 forced accompaniment in Section (e) because it viewed it 

22

 as akin in terms of the defendant's culpability to 

23

 murder.  It made it more serious than Section (d).  We 

24

 know from Section (d) that Congress viewed  endangering 

25

 a person's life with a gun or knife as only a minor 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

 aggravating factor that didn't warrant any mandatory

2

 minimum at all. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It  it didn't  it 

4

 didn't make it comparable to murder because the 

5

 provision itself says that the  the accompaniment 

6

 shall be  a person accompanied shall be in prison not 

7

 less than 10 years or if death results, shall be 

8

 punished by death or life in prison.  So it's  you are 

9

 talking 10 years. 

10

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, the death results 

11

 language was added in 1994 as a conforming amendment to 

12

 bring the statute in line with this Court's 

13

 jurisprudence.  If you look at our brief at pages 25 and 

14

 26, we have the original text of the statute.  Under the 

15

 original version passed in 1994  or 1934, forced 

16

 accompaniment and killing carried the exact same 

17

 statutory penalty.  Both required a mandatory minimum of 

18

 10 years.  Both required or made it ineligible for the 

19

 death penalty. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Which  which statute was 

21

 your client prosecuted under, the old one or the current 

22

 one?

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, certainly under the 

 current one. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah, well 

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. CARPENTER: 

But the  the context is

2

 still the same in  in the relationship with the 

3

 killing offense. 

4

 And I would go back to your earlier 

5

 question, Justice Scalia.  This statute, through the 

6

 killing offense, gives the government the tools it needs 

7

 to hold Mr. Whitfield directly responsible for the fact 

8

 that Mrs. Parnell died.  Mr. Whitfield was indicted for 

9

 a killing offense.  Over our objection, the District 

10

 Court interpreted that provision as a felony murder 

11

 provision that did not require any intent  intent 

12

 above and beyond the intent necessary for the bank 

13

 robbery itself.  And based on the evidence, the jury 

14

 rejected that count and held him not responsible for her 

15

 death. 

16

 It makes little sense to stretch the meaning 

17

 of a forced accompaniment so broadly that it allows the 

18

 government to hold him indirectly responsible for her 

19

 death when the jury, who we rely on to make these kinds 

20

 of determinations in our system 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I'm sorry, I would like 

22

 to stop you for a minute.  Because I thought that the 

23

 the killing was one thing.  But it  it wasn't 

24

 there  didn't the judge say you didn't ask for  what 

25

 was it

 MR. CARPENTER:

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Death results.
 death results, right. 
Justice Ginsburg, you are 

4

 correct that the Fourth Circuit threw out the death 

5

 results finding because it had not been charged in the 

6

 initial indictment. 

7

 But you're also correct that killing is a 

8

 separate offense.  As interpreted by the Fourth Circuit 

9

 at least, fourth  a forced 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So this  this jury  I 

11

 mean the issue of causing the death, that wasn't charged 

12

 and the defendant was not acquitted of that? 

13

 MR. CARPENTER: 

But that is a separate 

14

 offense.  As interpreted by the Fourth Circuit, there 

15

 are three offenses under Section (e), killing, forced 

16

 accompaniment, and the third is forced accompaniment 

17

 resulting in death.  The third is the one that wasn't 

18

 charged and was thrown out.  Even under it, we still 

19

 have the antecedent question of whether there was a 

20

 forced accompaniment in the first place. 

21

 But he was properly indicted on the killing 

22

 offense.  It was interpreted by the District Court as a 

23

 felony murder provision.  And based on the evidence, the 

24

 jury held that Mr. Whitfield was not responsible for 

25

 killing Mrs. Parnell.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If the test is more than de

2

 minimis, what does the judge tell the jury if the jury 

3

 says we don't understand what de minimis means? 

4

 MR. CARPENTER: 

I think de minimis is often, 

5

 in other jury instructions, defined as trivial or 

6

 insignificant, and we would 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What does that mean? 

8

 They  what does that mean in relationship to the 

9

 distance that must be involved? 

10

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, in our view, this is 

11

 the easy case in that it's only a few feet and it's 

12

 entirely within a person's own home.  The  we think 

13

 the way to effectuate that is through a substantiality 

14

 finding which juries make all the time in other  under 

15

 other criminal statutes. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You want to know what, I 

17

 mean, that's exactly the same question.  Look, 

18

 substantially  you tell the jury substantial, they 

19

 have no idea in this context.  I mean, I wouldn't.  I 

20

 would have thought yeah, moving a person  I don't see 

21

 what it has to do with her home or somebody else's home. 

22

 I don't see what that has to do with it.  And a few feet 

23

 sounds, yeah, it sounds substantial to me.  I know 

24

 nothing about it, you see. 

25

 So is there anything else you want to say in 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

 response to what Justice Alito said?  Because that 

2

 think of my problem.  It's not your client that is the 

3

 problem, but it's not the main problem.  The main 

4

 problem is to write a standard so people can understand 

5

 it.  And what do you want the words of that standard to 

6

 say? 

7

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Justice Breyer, I would go 

8

 back to the jury instruction that I set out earlier.  We 

9

 believe the jury could be charged in determining whether 

10

 the movement is substantial or whether the movement is 

11

 more than de minimis.  You could consider the amount of 

12

 distance that was traveled, whether the person was taken 

13

 into or out of the home or another building and whether 

14

 they were ultimately transported to a different place or 

15

 different location 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The problem is we don't 

17

 the jury would not know and the court would not know 

18

 what you are looking at, what ultimately you're 

19

 concerned about.  You have a number of factors.  But I 

20

 assume the point of this statute is to impose a severe 

21

 penalty in cases in which Congress thought there would 

22

 be great emotional distress for the person who is forced 

23

 to accompany that person. 

24
25

 Now, that could depend on lots of things, 
 not just the distance traveled.  So to  applying a 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

 purely spatial test to that just doesn't make any sense.

2

 You can't say is it substantial in relation to the thing 

3

 that this statute is getting at.  That is what I have a 

4

 problem with. 

5

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well I think in part you are 

6

 over reading what Congress was trying to do here by 

7

 suggesting that if the person was put in particular fear 

8

 or danger or trauma that that would justify any charge. 

9

 That's ­ That's not what he was looking at.  Because we 

10
11

 know 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What is the reason for this? 

12

 Why a heavier penalty for a case where there is 

13

 accompaniment it it's not that there is greater 

14

 across the whole category, greater likelihood of trauma 

15

 to the person who is involved? 

16

 MR. CARPENTER: 

We know that Congress viewed 

17

 the forced accompaniment provision as similar to 

18

 kidnapping, which under the Federal law at the time 

19

 required transportation entirely out of State and under 

20

 common law required transportation out of the country. 

21

 Under even the common definition of kidnapping at page 

22

 30 of our brief required more than a confinement or a 

23

 false imprisonment. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How do I know ­ How do I 

 know  Congress considered it equivalent to kidnapping? 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

 How do I know that? 

2

 MR. CARPENTER: 

3

Well, for those of you who

 do consider the legislative history, there are 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, I don't know it at all. 

5

 MR. CARPENTER: 

So you may not know this but 

6

  I think, Justice Scalia, you do know it from the 

7

 context, and particularly from the association that 

8

 Congress made in Section (e) between forced 

9

 accompaniment and killing.  It made both of those crimes 

10

 eligible for the death penalty at the discretion of the 

11

 jury.  And if you look at the broader code at that time, 

12

 there were only a handful of offenses that carried the 

13

 potential for the death penalty.  Among them were murder 

14

 and kidnapping. 

15

 So I think that is one very good reason why 

16

 we know that Congress would have been thinking of 

17

 accompaniment as something akin to kidnapping, which it 

18

 had in other provisions of the code 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

To do that you had to cross 

20

 State lines.  The kidnapping statute, you had to cross 

21

 State lines, and you don't even argue you have to cross 

22

 State lines. 

23

 MR. CARPENTER: 

No, absolutely not, Justice 

24

 Breyer.  We're not suggesting that Congress intended to 

25

 incorporate the elements of Federal kidnapping here. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

 But what we are saying  to go back to the question 

2

 about what we're trying to distinguish here, we believe

3

 that forced accompaniment and the instruction that we've 

4

 suggested for the jury allows the jury to distinguish 

5

 cases of confinement on the one hand  where the 

6

 movement is incidental to a confinement, you are keeping 

7

 a person in their home, you are keeping the person in 

8

 the bank  it distinguishes those from cases that we 

9

 would in a nontechnical sense think of as a kidnapping 

10

 or an abduction where you are taking someone from the 

11

 bank with you on the getaway, which was the John 

12

 Dillinger scenario we discussed in the briefs, or the 

13

 opposite scenario that I talked about from the Wilson case 

14

 a few minutes ago, where you take the bank employee from 

15

 their home to the bank.  That kind of situation is, we 

16

 believe, the heart of what Congress was trying to get 

17

 to. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, you might be right that 

19

 it's the heart of what Congress was trying to get at, but 

20

 this happens all the time when Congress writes statutes, 

21

 right?  It thinks about a particular case, it has an 

22

 idea in its mind of the sort of conduct that they mean, 

23

 which is this John Dillinger example, but then when it 

24

 gets down to drafting the words it writes words that are 

25

 broader than that, that include things that are not in 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1
2

 the front of their minds, like this one. 
 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, I think when you put

3

 the words they use in the context in which they use 

4

 them, it limits it to that kind of scenario.  And even 

5

 the government has never thought that these kinds of 

6

 a few steps of movement inside the bank qualify as a 

7

 forced accompaniment.  I would point to the cases cited 

8

 in our reply brief at pages 12 and 13, all of which were 

9

 charged under (a) or (d) and all of which clearly 

10

 involve movement that would easily satisfy the 

11

 government's singlestep rule here.  Yet in each of 

12

 those cases, based on the guidelines, based on the 3553A 

13

 factors, the district courts imposed sentences well 

14

 below the 10year mandatory minimum that would apply 

15

 under a Section (e) charge. 

16

 We know that if the Court here blesses the 

17

 singlestep rule that the government is now advocating, 

18

 which has never been present in the United States 

19

 Attorneys' Manual before, the default principle under 

20

 the Justice Department's charging guidelines will be to 

21

 include a Section (e) count in every bank robbery where 

22

 the prosecutor can allege and prove a single step of 

23

 movement that occurred in the course of the robbery. 

24

 That surely cannot be what Congress intended in the 

25

 structure of this statute where it designated Section 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

 (e) as an offense that was so much more serious and so 

2

 much more extreme 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But here it wasn't a 

4

 single step.  And it seems from what happened that this 

5

 case presents the  very danger that (e) wants to guard 

6

 against.  That is, the woman was  terrified and she had a 

7

 heart attack. 

8
9

 MR. CARPENTER: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

 disagree that  and the government actually agrees with 

10

 us at page 40 of their brief  with the notion that 

11

 dangerousness by itself can convert something into an 

12

 accompaniment that's not.  We believe first that in 

13

 Section (a) Congress required as an element of a basic 

14

 offense force, intimidation, or violence.  What that 

15

 tells us is that in every bank robbery, there is going 

16

 to be danger presented to everyone present.  And under 

17

 Section (d), Congress used danger as the jumping off 

18

 point for an aggravated offense under Section (d).  It 

19

 escalated the statutory maximum in cases where the 

20

 robber used a gun or a knife to put someone's life in 

21

 danger.  So I think the dangerousness by itself doesn't 

22

 get us to an (e) offense. 

23

 And also  so 

one more thing before I 

24

 reserve my time, which is that reversing this conviction 

25

 and rejecting the government's singlestep rule is in no 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

 way going to allow Mr. Whitfield to walk away from this 

2

 unpunished.  Even under our view, his sentence would be

3

 12 to 13 years, which is approximately four times the 

4

 amount that a bank robber receives  that a firsttime 

5

 offender like Mr. Whitfield receives for a bank robbery 

6

 offense.  That factors in his postrobbery conduct 

7

 during his flight and gives him adequate punishment for 

8

 that.  So the (e) charge is unnecessary to ensure that 

9

 he receives the punishment he needs.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN H. FLETCHER 

14
15
16
17

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. FLETCHER: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

 and may it please the Court: 
 Section 2113(e) prescribes greater 

18

 punishment for a bank robber who forces another 

19

 person to accompany him in committing the robbery or in 

20

 attempting to avoid arrest. 

21

 When Petitioner invaded the Parnell home and 

22

 forced Mrs. Parnell to go with him to a different room 

23

 where they could not be seen by the police, he violated 

24

 that statute because the forced movement fell squarely 

25

 within the ordinary meaning of the word "accompany."  In 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1
2

 everyday speech it is both proper and common to say that 
 one person accompanied someone else from one room

3

 of the house to another, and Congress chose to use that 

4

 broad nontechnical term in framing Section 2113(e).  It 

5

 didn't include any qualifying language requiring that 

6

 the forced accompaniment traverse a particular number of 

7

 feet, cross the threshold of a building or otherwise 

8

 cover a substantial distance. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes, but all the 

10

 definitions begin by saying accompanying is go with 

11

 somebody as an associate or companion.  Yes, it is 

12

 certainly a permissible use and a common use in context 

13

 to say I accompanied someone ­you know  across the hall. 

14

 But when you are in the context that this present one is 

15

 of bank robbery, the point of associate or companion, I 

16

 think, takes on greater weight.  Obviously, an unwilling 

17

 one. 

18

 MR. FLETCHER: 

I think you are right, 

19

 Mr. Chief Justice.  I think the connotation of 

20

 "accompany" focuses very much not only on movement but 

21

 also on movement together.  But as you say, it doesn't 

22

 have to be a friendly association or a voluntary 

23

 association. 

24
25

 I think this Court's opinion in Oregon v. 
 Elstad, which involved essentially the reverse of the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

 movement in this case  the police encountered a 

2

 suspect in the bedroom in his house and directed him to 

3

 get dressed and accompany them, this Court wrote, to the

4

 living room to answer questions.  I assume they hadn't 

5

 met before.  I assume that the association wasn't a sort 

6

 of longstanding one or a voluntary one.  But it's still 

7

 natural in those circumstances to describe two people 

8

 moving from one room to another with the term 

9

 "accompany." 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

All right, you take 

11

 two bank robberies.  One, the robber comes in, waves a 

12

 gun, pistol whips five people, grabs the money and 

13

 leaves.  Okay?  In another the bank robber comes in, 

14

 just gets the bag of money, says, you walk over here 2 

15

 feet with me, so he can get the bag of money and leaves. 

16

 The first one you could get probation.  I mean, you're 

17

 not going to, but there's no minimum sentence.  And 

18

 the second one you get at least 10 years.  That doesn't 

19

 make any sense. 

20

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Well, I think it does make 

21

 sense because I think Congress understood, and I think 

22

 in practice we would see that the first bank robber in 

23

 your first hypothetical is not going to get probation. 

24

 He is going to get a very, very substantial sentence. 

25

 And we know that Congress contemplated 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But they didn't care 

2

 exactly what the minimum was, right, even before the 

3

 sentencing guidelines, which would obviously have a

4

 higher sentence, they didn't care if it was one year 

5

 because of extenuating circumstances, whatever.  But, 

6

 they said, forcing someone to accompany you is so much 

7

 more serious that you get at least 10 years. 

8
9

 MR. FLETCHER: 

And I think that they had 

 good reason to do that, but I also just want to 

10

 highlight that the 10year mandatory minimum that they 

11

 set for the forced accompaniment offense is right in the 

12

 middle of the range for a completely unaggravated, 

13

 unarmed bank robbery in violation of Section 2113. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

15

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Range where? 

Of the statutory range of 

16

 zero  probation to 20 years.  The statutory maximum is 

17

 20 years and Congress set the limit for a nonaggravated 

18

 bank robbery.  For an armed bank robbery under 2113(d), 

19

 the statutory maximum is 25 years. 

20

 And so when Congress established a mandatory 

21

 minimum penalty for Section 2113(e) at 10 years, 

22

 absolutely it did that because it regarded 2113(e) 

23

 violations as culpable conduct that merited enhanced 

24

 punishment a deterrence.  But it also made clear that it 

25

 understood that there were going to be unaggravated bank 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

 robberies and armed bank robberies that warranted 

2

 greater punishment than forced accompaniments and it 

3

 left room for sentencing judges and now, with the

4

 guidelines, for sentences to be framed in a way that 

5

 took account of the type of aggravating circumstances 

6

 like pistol whipping the victim and threats and things 

7

 of the nature that you described that don't trigger a 

8

 statutory enhancement but that obviously sentencing 

9

 judges would consider. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Do you think there's 
The problem  the problem 

12

 is there is a set of cases where you can think it's 

13

 serious and a set of cases where you just think it 

14

 isn't.  The bank robbery  there are more in the bank 

15

 are the ones that concern me that it isn't.  The bank 

16

 robbers are in the bank, there are a couple of other 

17

 customers walk in and one of them says will you please 

18

 walk over here with me for a second.  Okay?  They walk 

19

 two feet to get him out of the way.  That doesn't sound 

20

 as if that is a lot worse than pistol whipping somebody. 

21

 And you can multiply those cases. 

22

 And what is worrying me about it is, since 

23

 it's a mandatory minimum, the prosecutors have a choice 

24

 about whether to  to indict or not on that ground, and 

25

 a person who is coming in and who is represented and 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

 what is his choice?  You know, you either plead guilty 

2

 or I put this in, too, because you moved one of the 

3

 customers 10 feet.

4

 Now, that's  that's the  it's the 

5

 that's the nature of the mandatory minimum which is 

6

 disturbing and calls, I think, for some kind of lenity 

7

 when there is openness of interpretation.  But on the 

8

 other hand it's very hard for me to distinguish how to 

9

 separate the cases that seem comparatively trivial 

10

 taking place within the bank from the ones where you 

11

 really are injecting fear, special fear, into the mind 

12

 of the person who is told to accompany you, and that 

13

 could take place even if it's like one foot, because 

14

 he's been singled out. 

15

 Okay. 

Is there any way to do it?  Is there 

16

 any way that you could reassure me that in these lesser 

17

 cases this will not be used as an instrument towards a 

18

 guilty plea or an instrument where these minor things 

19

 that he's been talking about nonstop, your brother over 

20

 here, that they'll certainly turn out to be charged 

21

 routinely? 

22

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Yes, absolutely.  I think 

23

 I would like to say a number of things.  I think the 

24

 first one goes to the charging question that you asked 

25

 and that my friend referred to.  He pointed to the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

 cases, the four cases that he cites at pages 12 and 13 

2

 of his reply brief as examples that would fall under our 

3

 definition of forced accompaniment but that weren't

4

 charged as such in this case.  But I think  or in 

5

 those particular cases. 

6

 I think what is important to highlight about 

7

 that is that three of the four cases arose in circuits 

8

 that have already adopted our rule.  One was in the 

9

 Seventh Circuit and one was in the Eleventh Circuit and 

10

 one was in the Ninth Circuit, and the Seventh and 

11

 Eleventh Circuits have specifically said that movement 

12

 within a bank, our rule here, you don't have to move 

13

 anyone a particular distance, you don't have to move 

14

 them out of the building.  And so the fact that they 

15

 weren't charged in that case reflects an exercise of the 

16

 government's charging discretion, not the fact that the 

17

 rule that we're asking you to adopt today had been 

18

 blessed by those circuits. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But that's what you are 

20

 going to lead it to, Mr. Fletcher, it's just going to be 

21

 prosecutorial good judgment that's going to separate the 

22

 case that's, like, could you come with me a couple of 

23

 feet. 

24
25

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Well, I think that is part of 

 it and I do think it's important to highlight that 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

 the  the charging guidance that my friend points to 

2

 does permit the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to 

3

 determine individual cases.

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right.  I guess I'm asking 

5

 you is there anything else.  Would you  you think that 

6

 there should not be a de minimis exception at all. 

7

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Well, I guess I don't 

8

 understand my friend to be really asking for a de 

9

 minimis exception, but let me 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

11

 minimis exception. 

12

 MR. FLETCHER: 

I'm asking about a de 

Well, the reason why I don't 

13

 think de minimis, although we could talk about very 

14

 short movements and my friend likes to  and we can 

15

 talk about, I don't think that de minimis movements 

16

 should be excluded.  I don't think it's reasonable to 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

18

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Even the one step? 
Yes, Your Honor, even the one 

19

 step.  And the  the reason why I don't think it's 

20

 reasonable to exclude those is that this statute only 

21

 applies to forced movements, and it's that element of

 force that I think my friend likes to ignore and focus 

23

 just on the step or two steps.  But every time a robber 

24

 violates the statute, he does it because he's forced

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Step over there or I'll 

 blow your head off is what he says. 
 MR. FLETCHER: 

Yes, and I imagine a 

 request 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

My  my example was meant 

 to encompass a polite, but armed, bank robber. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But the point is the 

17

 idea of someone whose bank is being robbed not being 

18

 forcibly compelled to accompany someone is fanciful, and 

19

 all you have to do, again  I guess it's repeating the 

20

 question  is you got two feet and the prosecutor is 

21

 armed with another 10 years automatically in his pocket, 

22

 and then you use that to extort a plea bargain of, you 

23

 know, six years, somebody who might otherwise wanted to 

24

 go to trial. 

25

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Well, we know that Congress 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

 drafted the statute as a mandatory minimum provision. 

2

 We know that it used broad language that encompasses 

3

 even very, very short movements.  And I think the

4

 discussion that 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

6

 question, I think. 

7

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Well, that begs the 

But, well, I was going to try 

8

 to get to the answer, which is that the reason why 

9

 Congress did that and I think the discussion today 

10

 highlights is because, number one, it's very, very hard 

11

 to separate out the cases that drive at the heartland of 

12

 what Congress was concerned about, the human shield and 

13

 the hostages situations, with any sort of rule based on 

14

 distance. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, your U.S. 

16

 attorney's manual does just that.  It says you prosecute 

17

 these when anyone forcibly abducts another during the 

18

 commission of any offense.  That seems to me to be 

19

 trying to take out those walked two feet.  That's not a 

20

 forcible abduction. 

21

 MR. FLETCHER: 

I  I'm not sure that is 

22

 correct, Mr. Chief Justice.  The U.S. attorney's manual 

23

 does refer to the Section 2113(e) offense in a 

24

 onesentence description as covering forcible abduction. 

25

 But I don't think  it's perfectly sensible and courts 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

 have used the word abduction to describe moving someone 

2

 from one place in a bank to another one. 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So  so you think

4

 when the manual says forcibly abducts, it means the 

5

 twofoot situation. 

6

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Potentially, yes.  The 

7

 guidelines  the sentencing guidelines use the word 

8

 abduction, for instance, Mr. Chief Justice 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What about  that  why don't 

10

 we say that?  Say that what this statute covers is 

11

 forcible abduction, and there we are.  That's not 

12

 perfect.  But it's ­ it at least my polite 

13

 robber who asks the person to move over hasn't abducted 

14

 him and in many of these de minimis cases there won't be 

15

 an abduction.  Why not just pick up those words and say 

16

 indeed, the government uses that when it explains it. 

17

 MR. FLETCHER: 

armed bank 

Well, Congress used very, 

18

 very different language.  Congress didn't incorporate 

19

 the common law of kidnapping.  It didn't refer to an 

20

 abduction.  It used the word "accompanying" which has an 

21

 everyday meaning that encompasses short movements. 

22

 But also, I think  I understand the 

23

 impetus that some of your questions suggest that 

24

 abduction carries up or connotes long movements, but 

25

 that's not the way that it's used in the U.S. attorney's 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

 manual and it's not the way that it's used in the 

2

 provision of the guidelines which provides an 

3

 enhancement for a bank robbery or for any robbery that

4

 involves the abduction of a victim. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So the manual is 

6

 read  forcibly abducts, they read as for somebody to 

7

 move two feet.  That's an abduction? 

8
9
10
11

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Yes.  They don't view it as 

 limiting the charges under Section 2113(e) to require 
 movement of any particular distance. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And so the manual 

12

 which  the other provision in the manual which is that 

13

 you should charge as large an offense as possible means 

14

 that in the case where somebody is forced to move two 

15

 feet, you charge the  that as a forcible abduction. 

16

 MR. FLETCHER: 

No, that is not correct and 

17

 in part that is because the manual doesn't say you 

18

 always charge the most serious offense.  It says you 

19

 charge the most serious offense that's consistent with 

20

 the nature of the conduct at issue and that that 

21

 permits, and in fact requires, an individualized 

22

 assessment of the defendant's conduct. 

23
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So is two feet 

 consistent with the conduct at issue? 
 MR. FLETCHER: 

Well, I think  I think 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

 there is a reason and I  I do think there's a reason 

2

 why Congress covered even very short movements, and 

3

 that's in part because every time a robber forces

4

 someone to go with him he exposes that person to a great 

5

 degree of trauma, to physical danger, and I think also 

6

 Congress reasonably decided not to try to write in a 

7

 limitation to use a term that includes movements as 

8

 short as a few feet because it's so difficult to draw a 

9

 line.  It's difficult to draw an administrable line at 

10

 all.  And any of the lines that have been offered to you 

11

 by my friend, by the amicus briefs, by the lower courts 

12

 that have tried to cabin this statute by departing from 

13

 its text, all of them would exclude cases that would 

14

 give rise to exactly the sorts of dangers that Congress 

15

 was concerned about, which are robbers using victims as 

16

 human shields, or robbers holding the gun to the head of 

17

 the victim and dragging them around the bank during the 

18

 offense.  I think all of those are at the heartland of 

19

 what Congress was concerned about. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

When Congress first drafted 

21

 this accompanying language, this was a capital offense, 

22

 yes? 

23

 MR. FLETCHER: 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

Potentially, yes. 
So, I mean, would you say 

 the same thing if it were still a capital offense? 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

 MR. FLETCHER: 

We would.  We think the 

2

 the offense had the same meaning then and now.  And I 

3

 think part of the reason why we'd say that is, first and

4

 foremost, that the statutory language we think 

5

 "accompanying" has a plain meaning that includes those 

6

 sorts of movements. 

7

 But also I think it  it's true, my friend 

8

 likes to point out that it was potentially death 

9

 eligible, but the sentencing range in the 1934 statute 

10

 was a minimum of 10 years to a death sentence if the 

11

 verdict of the jury shall so recommend. 

12

 The murderer statute at  in 1934 in 

13

 contrast said that if you murder someone it's a 

14

 mandatory death penalty or life imprisonment.  I 

15

 think 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course that was 

17

 unconstitutional, right?  The  imposing the death 

18

 penalty for this. 

19
20
21

 MR. FLETCHER: 

That's correct.  The Court 

 later held 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

For even  even 

22

 kidnapping, you know, taking the person away when you're 

23

 fleeing.  It was unconstitutional to apply the death 

24

 penalty, so we really don't  don't have to take that 

25

 into account, I suppose. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1
2
3

 MR. FLETCHER: 

That's correct.  In the 

 current statute 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I was just

4

 suggesting that maybe we should take that into account 

5

 in thinking about what Congress could have meant for 

6

 this statute to mean, but it seems  it  it seems 

7

 very unlikely that Congress meant to give the death 

8

 penalty to somebody who forced another person to move 

9

 two feet. 

10

 MR. FLETCHER: 

And I think Congress probably 

11

 understood that a jury would be very unlikely, in fact, 

12

 almost certain not to recommend the death penalty in a 

13

 case like that. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, no, no.  But we're 

15

 talking about what the proper instructions to a jury, 

16

 not jury nullification.  Don't  don't play  don't 

17

 play that card. 

18

 MR. FLETCHER: 

But, Justice Kennedy, I'm not 

19

 suggesting that they nullify on the guilt offense, but 

20

 the penalty provision in the 1934 statute said it's 

21

 punishable by death if the verdict of the jury shall so 

22

 recommend 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

 MR. FLETCHER: 

25

Are the 
 which permitted a jury to 

 decide the severity of the offense. 

Alderson Reporting Company

42
1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What's wrong with de 

2

 minimis?  Meaning why don't we leave it to the jury to 

3

 decide when a movement is inconsequential,  it's

4

 trivial?  We're worried about telling them what that 

5

 what that is, but we use the word de minimis all the 

6

 time, and all we tell juries is you don't have to find 

7

 this if the movement was really trivial and 

8

 inconsequential. 

9
10

 MR. FLETCHER: 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I  I 
And they can then use 

11

 their judgment instead of the prosecutor about when 

12

 something is causing the kind of fear that Congress 

13

 worried about. 

14

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Well, I think that's a long 

15

 ways from the statutory text, first and foremost.  I 

16

 also don't think that it's consistent 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, we  we've 

18

 basically said, albeit only a civil area, that we always 

19

 assume that trivial and inconsequential matters will not 

20

 be covered by a law. 

21

 MR. FLETCHER: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23
24
25

You're right.  De minimis 
I don't know why that 

 can't be true in the criminal area either. 
 MR. FLETCHER: 

De minimis is a general 

 principle of law.  I, like you, have not found a case 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

 where this Court has applied it in the criminal context. 

2

 I think in part that's because it's ultimately about 

3

 deciding what Congress intended to prescribe.

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, if we were going to 

5

 apply it I guess what we would apply is was there 

6

 significant fear or trauma induced?  I mean, that's 

7

 that's what the statute's about.  Threatening people, 

8

 causing them such excitement that they may have a heart 

9

 attack, as happened here.  I don't know that the 

10

 distance is what is de minimis.  It's how much you put 

11

 the person in fear, I suppose. 

12

 MR. FLETCHER: 

I do think that that's right 

13

 and I think that points up that crafting any sort of a 

14

 de minimis or substantiality requirement that tried to 

15

 get at the concerns that Congress had in passing the 

16

 statute would be extremely hard to do.  And I think the 

17

 jury that asks, as Justice Alito suggested, what do you 

18

 mean by de minimis?  How are we supposed to determine 

19

 whether or not a movement is de minimis?  It would be 

20

 very, very difficult to give that jury a reasonable 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, but you could say de 

22

 minimis did because of the language that you point to, 

23

 accompaniment.  That's what I criticized you earlier as 

24

 just being too vague.  But where movements are small, 

25

 this is  where movements are small  in considering 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

 de minimis you can consider that where movements are 

2

 small, the absence or presence of the kind of fear that 

3

 is connoted by the word abduction, which  that's a

4

 little tough.  But I see your point there. 

5

 But the alternative is just this sort of 

6

 vast discretion in bank robbery cases where  where 

7

 there has been nothing more like an inch or it really 

8

 had nothing to do with the abduction concern and the 

9

 distances were miniscule. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's a very bad statute. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Would you admit that? 

12

 MR. FLETCHER: 

I would disagree with that. 

13

 I would say though that even if you agree with that, 

14

 that's not a reason to read it other than according to 

15

 its terms. 

16

 And I think, Justice Breyer, my friend likes 

17

 to suggest that if you go our way on this you really are 

18

 going to open up this discretion for prosecutors to 

19

 charge the 2113(e) offense in a vast number of cases. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Yes, that's true. 
Respectfully, though, I don't 

22

 think he's been able to substantiate that with any kind 

23

 of evidence.  As we pointed out 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, 95 or  over 

 90 percent of all the criminal charges in the country 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

 are pleaded guilty.  Isn't that the right number, 

2

 something like that? 

3

 MR. FLETCHER: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I 
And certainly you do read 

5

 lots of criticisms of people pleading guilty because 

6

 they are afraid that in the absence of the guilty plea 

7

 the sentence will go way up.  I don't know how true that 

8

 is, I haven't seen the studies, but I'm certainly 

9

 familiar with literature that says that. 

10

 MR. FLETCHER: 

I understand the concern but 

11

 it arises only to the extent that forced accompaniments 

12

 of short distances are common in bank robberies. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no.  That is 

14

 exactly where the prosecutor needs another ace in his 

15

 hand.  In other words, if he's waving a gun, if he's 

16

 assaulting the people, if he's shooting them, fine, he's 

17

 got enough leverage.  But when he hasn't done any of 

18

 that and all he's done is asked the teller or whoever to 

19

 accompany him for  of forced, I'm sorry, the teller to 

20

 accompany him for a few feet, that's where the 

21

 prosecutor says I, you know, it's a good thing I've got 

22

 these 10 years or otherwise he might go to trial. 

23

 MR. FLETCHER: 

I don't think that's correct, 

24

 Mr. Chief Justice.  I think in a number  our rule has 

25

 been the law in a number of circuits, at least four of 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

 them, in the Eleventh Circuit since the Bauer decision 

2

 in 1992, and yet you don't see and Petitioner certainly 

3

 hasn't pointed to you a pattern of prosecutorial abuse

4

 in those circuits.  Instead what you see is the case, 

5

 the Section 2113(e) offense being charged in unusual 

6

 bank 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

How would you  how 

8

 would you see the evidence of prosecutorial abuse?  When 

9

 you have these cases, he says I'm going to charge you 

10

 with a 10year minimum, and the guy says, my gosh, I 

11

 can't risk that, I'm going to plead guilty to 6 years or 

12

 7 years.  I don't see how that pattern could show up in 

13

 any kind of statistics. 

14

 MR. FLETCHER: 

Well, for one thing, I mean, 

15

 both sides here are looking at the fact patterns in 

16

 reported cases.  There could be 

17
18
19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It would not be a 

 reported case because he would have pled guilty. 
 MR. FLETCHER: 

But even guilty pleas can 

20

 give rise to reported cases that describe the facts of 

21

 the offense if there's an appeal relating to sentencing, 

22

 as there often is.  And we just don't see the government 

23

 bringing this charge in part because most bank robberies 

24

 do not involve forced movement.  The classic bank 

25

 robbery 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

When they plead 

2

 guilty don't they have to  I don't remember if this is 

3

 just limited to the State systems or not  don't they

4

 have to waive their rights to appeal? 

5

 MR. FLETCHER: 

In some cases guilty pleas do 

6

 include waivers of appeal rights.  So I'm  I 

7

 understand the point that many guilty pleas wouldn't 

8

 show up in reported cases, but I think we also provide 

9

 statistics about the number of  guilty pleas that 

10

 would still be sentenced according to the sentencing 

11

 guidelines and we provide statistics that say that 

12

 and  and would show up in the FBI's bank crime 

13

 statistics. 

14

 We provide statistics suggesting that 

15

 most  the overwhelming majority of bank robberies are 

16

 limited to the teller area.  They don't involve moving 

17

 someone to the vault.  The classic bank robbery  we 

18

 cite to the secondary literature as well  involves 

19

 someone walking up to a teller and presenting a demand 

20

 note or making an oral demand.  And I think once a 

21

 robber goes beyond that and begins forcibly 

22

 orchestrating the movement of people around the bank, 

23

 that's stuff that  conduct that's typically 

24

 accomplished with a weapon or with physical  direct 

25

 application of physical force to compel people to move 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

 around the bank.  And I think Congress correctly made a 

2

 judgment that that's significantly aggravated conduct 

3

 that separates those offenses from the minerun bank

4

 robberies. 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But the problem is that 

6

 there is some fortuity in this.  Some bank robbers will 

7

 tell people, tellers, move to that corner and lay down 

8

 on the floor and they'll just point the gun.  There is 

9

 no accompaniment.  Some of them may say move, and move 

10

 with them.  There is 

11

 MR. FLETCHER: 

There's  there's no doubt 

12

 that there's some fortuity.  That's going to happen any 

13

 time Congress frames a broad rule.  But I do think that 

14

 being forced to move around the bank with the robber is 

15

 materially worse and materially more dangerous to the 

16

 victims than being ordered to move to the other side of 

17

 the bank by the robber. 

18

 If the robber comes into the bank and pulls 

19

 a gun, everyone in the gun is going to be  everyone in 

20

 the bank is going to be frightened.  And if he directs 

21

 everyone to go over to one side of the room, that's 

22

 going to be frightening, too.  But if he picks out a 

23

 teller and says, You're coming with me and we're going 

24

 to the vault, that teller is going to be the most afraid 

25

 in the bank, the most traumatized.  That person's going 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

 to be in the greatest danger, at the greatest risk of 

2

 further violence from the robber, and that person is 

3

 going to be in the worst possible place if the police

4

 respond, if an armed guard responds, or if some sort of 

5

 confrontation breaks out. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I just don't 

7

 see that as a common sense proposition.  If you're a 

8

 teller, when are you more scared, when the guy has a gun 

9

 pointed at you and says get the money or when the guy 

10

 does not have a gun so far as you can see and says you 

11

 better come with me over to the vault? 

12

 MR. FLETCHER: 

So I think potentially in 

13

 in the case with a gun, but a couple of points on that. 

14

 One is the vast majority, as far as I can tell, 2113(e), 

15

 forced accompaniment offenses, almost always involve 

16

 weapons.  I think the parties cite, you know, 6 or 8 

17

 lower court cases that have involved the  the question 

18

 at issue here.  How far do you have to move in order to 

19

 be a forced accompaniment.  In all of them except this 

20

 one, the person had either a gun or knife.  And I think 

21

 that makes sense because if you're going to be trying to 

22

 direct the people  the movement of people within the 

23

 bank, you're going to do that by means of a gun or a 

24

 knife. 

25

 The second thing that I'd say is that I do 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

 think that the teller who is forced to move with the 

2

 robber, even if we hypothesize the unusual case of a 

3

 robber who doesn't have a weapon, that teller is still

4

 sort of at risk of further physical force unarmed by the 

5

 robber himself; that person is still in danger in the 

6

 event that an armed confrontation breaks out with 

7

 someone else.  That person is still in a very, very bad 

8

 position. 

9

 I think Congress reasonably decided that it 

10

 wanted to deter bank robbers from involving innocent 

11

 people in their offense.  And I think it sensibly made 

12

 the decision to deter that sort of conduct at the very 

13

 first step by writing the statute in a way that 

14

 prohibits forced accompaniment, a term that as our briefs 

15

 demonstrate, readily encompasses the type of movement at 

16

 issue here from one room to another.  And I think also 

17

 readily encompasses even movements as short as a few 

18

 steps. 

19

 The example that my friend gave earlier was 

20

 moving from one side of the lectern to another, and he 

21

 suggested that movements of that order aren't  aren't 

22

 sensibly described as accompaniments.  I think to the 

23

 contrary, if Mr. Dreeben had joined me when I came to 

24

 the lectern to present my argument a few minutes ago, we 

25

 would very easily say that he accompanied me to the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1
2

 lectern to present the argument. 
 This Court used the word "accompany" to 

3

 describe a movement of just a few steps in Washington v.

4

 Chrisman where the issue was a police officer 

5

 accompanying a college student from the public corridor 

6

 of the student's dorm into the student's dorm room.  And 

7

 I think by choosing to use that term, Congress made the 

8

 judgment that forced movements with a robber present 

9

 enhanced dangers, present greater trauma to the victims, 

10

 and that it was appropriate to deter and punish that 

11

 conduct with a broad rule, because in every instance 

12

 where it arises, it presents some dangers.  But also 

13

 because to try to draft any line that excludes some of 

14

 the types of hypotheticals that the Court has proposed 

15

 today would be very difficult to do, would produce an 

16

 arbitrary and hard to administer standard and would 

17

 inevitably rule out some of the cases that Congress 

18

 meant to include when it drafted the statute. 

19

 If the Court has 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose we had substantial 

21

 evidence that prosecutors were using the threat of this 

22

 extra charge in order to obtain guilty pleas, very 

23

 substantial evidence, would that be a basis for us to 

24

 rule that the statute is either inoperable altogether or 

25

 that it should be interpreted in a way consistent with 

Alderson Reporting Company

2

 what the Petitioner argues? 
 MR. FLETCHER: 

I don't think so.  I don't 

3

 think this Court has ever suggested that the charging

4

 decisions with respect to a particular statute should 

5

 inform the way the statute is interpreted. 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you think that concern 

7

 is simply irrelevant to the interpretative task that we 

8

 face. 

9

 MR. FLETCHER: 

I think the Court has said 

10

 that the interpretative task in interpreting a statute 

11

 is to give the words of the statute their ordinary 

12

 meaning in the context in which they're enacted.  I 

13

 don't think that is considered  a charge of questions 

14

 is  of charging discretion would play into that 

15

 inquiry. 

16

 I understand why such a hypothetical pattern 

17

 of prosecutorial abuse would give the Court pause and 

18

 would be of concern, and I think that's why it's 

19

 significant that to the extent that those concerns do 

20

 arise, we don't have evidence of that here in the 

21

 circuits that have adopted our rule or something very 

22

 much like it.  And I don't think there's any indication 

23

 that prosecutors are departing from the instruction to 

24

 consider the circumstances of individual cases in 

25

 bringing charges.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA B. CARPENTER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. CARPENTER: 

Thank you.  I would offer 

 the Court first a twist on the old adage from 

10

 Justice Holmes, which is to say that sad facts sometimes 

11

 make very bad law.  The facts of this case are 

12

 undoubtedly sad, but the broad rule that the government 

13

 seeks to apply here would cover cases where the facts 

14

 aren't as sad and aren't  aren't tragic at all. 

15

 I would go to your point, Justice Scalia, 

16

 about whether we should somehow interpret the statute to 

17

 cover cases where there's particularly heightened 

18

 trauma.  On that issue, there was trauma here, but it 

19

 had nothing to do with the movement from one room to 

20

 another and it had everything to do with the fact that 

21

 he invaded her home.  So it can't  this case can't 

22

 turn  the application of this provision can't turn on 

23

 the happenstance of whether she was sitting in her room 

24

 when he walked in or whether she happened to be standing 

25

 at the hallway and he asked her to move into the room. 

Alderson Reporting Company

 Also, the government repeatedly points out 

2

 all the bad conduct that can happen even where there is 

3

 movement of only a few feet, and it's inside the bank,

4

 but it can be accompanied with physical assault, et 

5

 cetera.  I would point the Court to the government's own 

6

 brief at page 23 where my friend cites a series of cases 

7

 that he described as the most egregious examples of 

8

 forced movements over a short distance. 

9

 In each of those  in three of those cases 

10

 they were decided under the guidelines, Davis, Lewis and 

11

 Reid.  In each one, based on the guidelines and based on 

12

 the 3553(a) factors, the district courts imposed a 

13

 sentence well below the statutory maximum that was 

14

 available for an (a) offense.  What that tells us is 

15

 that the enhanced statutory maximums under (e) aren't 

16

 necessary, even in these egregious cases where the 

17

 movement is accompanied by physical assault and where 

18

 it's of a short distance in the bank. 

19

 On the flip side, though, the government's 

20

 broad, singlestep rule is going to be tremendously 

21

 harmful in the mine run of bank robberies where you have 

22

 only a few feet of movement and which present the 

23

 problems that many of you have touched upon about the 

24

 exercise of prosecutorial discretion. 

25

 It's important to point out that in his 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

 presentation today, my friend mentioned that well, the 

2

 guidelines  the guidelines charging manual doesn't 

3

 actually provide a limit here because abduction means

4

 even movement of a single step.  So we know that the 

5

 government isn't disavowing the singlestep rule.  It 

6

 continues to advance it before this Court. 

7

 And the government has also pointed to 

8

 problems with line drawing.  There's no doubt that it is 

9

 not easy to draw a line in a case like this.  But that 

10

 doesn't justify the Court or the government in throwing 

11

 up its hands and saying there's no line at all.  I would 

12

 say that the rule of lenity should have special force in 

13

 the context of mandatory minimum provisions like this 

14

 one, both because of the notice that a criminal 

15

 defendant should receive that his conduct is so severe, 

16

 that he's going to face the mandatory minimum penalty as 

17

 severe as this one, and because of the harm to the 

18

 system that flows from a broadly applicable mandatory 

19

 minimum that gives the prosecution the ability to 

20

 threaten these charges in otherwise ordinary bank 

21

 robbery cases. 

22

 If there are no further questions, we'd ask 

23

 the Court to reverse the (e) conviction and send this 

24

 case back for resentencing.
