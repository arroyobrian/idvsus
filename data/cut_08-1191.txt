CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument next this morning in Case 08-1191, Morrison v.

5

National Australia Bank.

6

Mr. Dubbs.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. DUBBS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. DUBBS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Given that the issue of subject matter

12

jurisdiction appears not to be in dispute, the issues

13

before the Court today are:

14

First, the scope of section 10(b) of the

15

1934 Exchange Act when applied to alleged fraudulent

16

conduct with respect to financial information that is to

17

be sent to Australia for incorporation into the

18

financial statements of the Respondent, National

19

Australia Bank.

20

And second, the reasonableness of the

21

application of the statute under these circumstances and

22

the norms of enforcement pursuant to the private cause

23

of action or otherwise.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess there's also the

issue of whether, if everybody is agreed that it is not

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a jurisdictional question, that's the end of the case.

2

I mean, as I recall, the other side says we shouldn't

3

get to the merits.

4

MR. DUBBS:

Your Honor, it's our view that

5

that -- that is a possible outcome, which of course as I

6

understand it would leave -- leave the decision below

7

standing.

8

it may want to remand for consideration of the change of

9

position of the Securities and Exchange Commission with

We have urged in the supplemental brief that

10

respect to the tests that they have -­

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12
13

But you are not -- you are

not pressing that?
MR. DUBBS:

No, we still believe that the

14

best way to handle the case is to remand; but we leave

15

that for the Court's discretion.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

be going through the motions?

18

the wrong label on it, but everything it said could have

19

been plugged into:

20

rather than 12(b)(1)?

21

Why wouldn't that simply
The Second Circuit put

Our decision is under Rule 12(b)(6)

MR. DUBBS:

Well, Your Honor, the question

22

and the issue is inherently somewhat speculative as to

23

what the Second Circuit would do, but we would rely not

24

necessarily only on the subject matter jurisdiction

25

issues being addressed -- and Your Honor is quite right

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that they may say, well, the label's changed, but

2

everything else stays the same.

3

thought might be instructive for this Court is to hear

4

what the Second Circuit that sits in our nation's

5

financial capital thought of a new fact, and that new

6

fact is that for the first time the Securities and

7

Exchange Commission has come in and said as a matter of

8

administrative deference the Court should defer to our

9

test in cases like that.

10

What we particularly

Sure, they have submitted amicus briefs in

11

the past.

They have done lots of things.

12

the first time they have said:

13

responsible for the statute have said this is how courts

14

should handle the case.

15

different, but if Your Honors don't wish to proceed

16

along that line we are prepared to go forward on -- on

17

the merits here today.

We as the agency

That's what's new and

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

Well, it seems to me that

19

isn't worth anything, right?

20

haven't conducted a rulemaking or anything.

21

MR. DUBBS:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23
24
25

But this is

I mean, that's -- they

Well, they haven't conducted -­
They just -- just appeared

in court.
MR. DUBBS:

Well, they haven't conducted a

full rulemaking that would be entitled to Chevron

Alderson Reporting Company

deference.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. DUBBS:

Right.

But they have done something

4

less than that.

5

Skidmore deference, or something lesser than that is an

6

open point.

7

as to whether it is just -­

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

And whether it's entitled to deference,

But so we leave it to the Court's decision

Except that they don't come

out on your side anyway, do they?

10

MR. DUBBS:

Well, Your Honor, they come out

11

on our side except for that last turn they make at the

12

end, where they -- they bring in the intervening clause

13

at the end of the last act.

Other than that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

How could they come down

15

on your side if they say there is no private right of

16

action?

17

MR. DUBBS:

Well, they didn't say there was

18

no private right of action.

19

was no private right of action in this case because of

20

their application of the intervening clause test, which

21

we submit was error and clear error in light of the

22

factors that have to go into the intervening -­

you in this case.

MR. DUBBS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So what could -- and that

is going to change the Second Circuit's view of things,

the fact that, in addition to their initial opinion, it

has been reconfirmed, although on different grounds,

10

by -- by the government?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dubbs, you said

20

something that I thought quite revealing in this -- in

21

your brief.

23

has "Australia" written all over it.

24

brief you said:

I mean, this case is Australian plaintiff,

And in your reply

"If the Plaintiff is a foreign

7
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

clear that forum non conveniens may dictate dismissal of

2

an action brought in the U.S."
And taking that, why not -- of the

3
4

applicable laws to this transaction, to this alleged

5

fraud, isn't the most appropriate choice the law of

6

Australia rather than the law of the United States?

7

MR. DUBBS:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

No -­
Not just a question of

proper forum, but the proper law?

10

MR. DUBBS:

No, Your Honor.

We think that,

11

given the scope of section 10(b), American law can and

12

should be applied here.

13

with the observation that this case has "Australia"

14

written all over it.

15

has "Florida" written all over it because Florida is

16

where the numbers were doctored, Florida is where the

17

fraudulent conduct in putting the phony assumptions into

18

the valuation portfolio were done.

19

happened -­

And we respectfully disagree

Indeed, from our point of view it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

Everything

If all that were done and

21

it were never communicated, there wouldn't be any

22

violation.

23

MR. DUBBS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

done in Australia by the Australian bank.

And the communication was

8
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. DUBBS:

The communication was done

2

between Florida and -- and Australia, and the senior

3

management of HomeSide in Florida created those numbers

4

with the expectation and the knowledge that those would

5

go into the financial statement.

6

substantial conduct in Florida in terms of the fraud.

7

They made the misrepresentation pursuant to what "make"

8

means, pursuant to the 1934 dictionary.

So that means there is

They engaged in hard-core fraudulent conduct

by doctoring the books, by putting the phony assumptions

into the computer model.

servicing rights number that appears on -- on the

15

balance sheet at page 11 -­

Without that there wouldn't
In one sense it's a one-issue

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

Let's -- let's go back to

17

the question that I asked you about the appropriate

18

forum.

19

plaintiff is a foreign securities purchaser.

20

plaintiff's choice is not -- is not its home forum, the

21

presumption in the plaintiff's favor applies with less

22

force, et cetera.

suing in the United States based on shares purchased in

24

Australia and the lead defendant is the Australian bank.

25

You -- you seem to give this very case -- the
When the

But you have an Australian plaintiff

So what -- what did you mean when you were

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

referring to Sinochem and forum non conveniens?

2

MR. DUBBS:

We meant two things, Your Honor.

3

The first thing we meant was that, in addition to the

4

other tests that are proposed, putting Sinochem at the

5

beginning of the train would sort out some of these

6

questions in general.

7

That's in general.

As to our particular case, we believe we

8

would win a forum non conveniens argument, though one

9

was never made and that was not explored by any district

10

judge.

11

specifically provides in section 10(b) that fraud can be

12

caused in any number of ways -- three ways, including

13

through the mails, through foreign or interstate

14

commerce, or over an exchange.

15

caused in Florida and the mails were used and it was in

16

foreign or interstate commerce.

17

And we would win that because the statute

And that fraud was

And the people who committed the fraud on a

18

nuts-and-bolts level are the senior management who are

19

defendants from HomeSide bank in Florida, so to that

20

extent it is a Florida case.

21

district judge in looking at a forum non motion would

22

also look at the various interests of National Australia

23

Bank in HomeSide in the United States to judge the

24

overall fairness of letting the suit proceed against

25

them and to counter the issue that this is really all

And we also think that any

about Australia.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, wouldn't your clients

3

have an adequate remedy under Australian law in

4

Australia, in the Australian court system?

5

MR. DUBBS:

We might or we might not.

6

that is not determinative.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

Well, let's assume that -­

8

that they do not.

Let's assume that on the facts of

9

this case they could not prevail under Australian law in

10

the Australian court system.

11

interest is there -­

12

MR. DUBBS:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

Then what United States

There -­
-- that should override

that?
MR. DUBBS:

15

There is a strong United States

interest.

17

States -- United States interest deals with the conduct

18

at issue here, namely the conduct in Florida by

21

It's on two levels.

conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation

23

of 10(b); is that right?
MR. DUBBS:

24
25

Honor.

We do not agree with that, Your

We believe that they made a representation by

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

creating the false numbers, or otherwise it's within the

2

scope of the statute.

3

deceptive device -­

4

What they did is create a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But nothing has happened.

5

Suppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and

6

they didn't act on it?

7

MR. DUBBS:

Your -- Your Honor, that goes to

8

a different element of the cause of action.

9

doesn't go to the scope of the statute.

10

That

That goes to

how the private cause of action is enforced.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

Now, I concede your

12

argument that a big component of this fraud was what

13

went on in Florida, but it needed to be disclosed to the

14

public.

15

done in Florida by the Florida defendants.

16

It needed to be put out there.

MR. DUBBS:

And that wasn't

It was done in Australia and we

17

can prove that.

And -- the point is we are not -- all

18

we are proving through doing that is the effects of the

19

fraud in Florida.

20

where you have poison candy in one jurisdiction, that

21

poison candy is sent to another jurisdiction, and in the

22

first jurisdiction there is a law that says "thou shalt

23

not make poison candy;" through the exercise of

24

legislative jurisdiction that statute in the first

25

jurisdiction is appropriate, and both jurisdictions have

To use Professor Beale's example,

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

an interest in that.

2

Now, if we are in the poison candy

3

jurisdiction and we are bringing a case about poison

4

candy, if the statute in addition says, "you have to

5

show some harm from the poison candy," indeed you might

6

as a matter of proof have to show effects from that

7

other forum.

8

conduct in the second forum or anything else in the

9

second forum.

But that's different than regulating

That is simply looking at the statute or

10

the legal prescription against making poison candy.

11

we say section 10(b) is like the poison candy statute.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

Which of your standards -­
Now, that's -- I would like

14

you to follow that up specifically.

15

the difficult issue in this case is not the

16

jurisdictional issue under principles of international

17

law.

18

And there the things against you are three.

19

Professor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know

20

your answer to.

21

opinions.

22

That is, in my mind

It's the question of the scope of the statute.
One is

The second is in Judge Friendly's two

The first opinion -- the second one, rather,

23

Bersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and

24

foreign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign

25

plaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange,

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

even if that fraud takes place totally in the United

2

States, the statute wouldn't cover it.

3

which started this.

4

That's Friendly,

And the third thing is what he says in

5

Leasco.

6

not taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs

7

who are Americans.

8
9

He says:

We cannot see any sound reason for

Okay?

Now, France, Britain and Australia have
filed briefs in this case giving what they consider very

10

sound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly

11

never considered.

12

is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win,

13

how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate

14

their own securities markets, right?

15

That's all one question:

And those three reasons, as we know,

Professor Sachs,

16

Friendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco.

17

what I'd like to hear your answer to.
MR. DUBBS:

18

But that's

I will try to keep the subparts

19

in mind.

Why don't we start from the end and try to

20

work backwards.

21

of the record is the Solicitor General's view that as a

22

general matter -- and I will get to the specifics; I'm

23

not ducking that.

24

enforcement of the securities laws, unlike the antitrust

25

laws, has not historically and today they do not believe

Perhaps one of the most important parts

But as a general matter the

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

runs -- raises a substantial risk of interstate

2

conflict.
Now, as to the specific briefs that Your

3
4

Honor referenced, if we look at those briefs and we look

5

at those compared to what happened in Hartford Fire,

6

those briefs -- and let's focus on Australia's for the

7

moment because that's the country we are talking about.

8

Australia's brief essentially says they have a

9

regulatory system that may -- that we may or may not

10

have been able to litigate this cause of action in

11

Australia, but let's assume that we could.
They are not saying -- they did not say in

12
13

that brief that there was some fundamental conflict,

14

like the plurality found in Hartford Fire; nor did they

15

say that there was the kind of conflict that comes up in

16

the application of 403(h) of the Restatement, which

17

Justice Scalia looked to in his opinion in Hartford

18

Fire.

19

necessarily -- necessarily -- to not reasonably applying

20

the statute.

21

So there is not the kind of conflict that leads

The reason there's not is that because, one,

22

there is not a rule in Australia that one has to abide

23

by and a rule in the United States that one has to abide

24

by that are contradictory.

25

you have a clear rule in the United States that says

At most, what you have is

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

thou shalt not commit fraud in Florida through either

2

the Florida through either -- for or in interstate

3

commerce, the mails or through an exchange.

4

other side of the equation what you have is maybe they

5

could have brought suit over here and we have a robust

6

regulatory system and a robust litigation system; more

7

power to them.

8

10

And on the

But that doesn't mean -- saying that, that
doesn't mean that the first State where the poison candy
was made suddenly has no interest in that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but -- but Australia

says:

13

14

been relied upon by the -- by the plaintiffs, point two.

15

And we should be able to decide that and we don't want

16

it decided by a foreign court.

17

Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has

You are talking about a misrepresentation,

18

if there was one in this case, made in Australia to

19

Australian purchasers; it ought to be up to us to decide

20

that issue; and here you are dragging the American

21

courts into it.

22

MR. DUBBS:

Well, let me deal with the

23

dragging in part in a minute, because that's

24

subliminally very important to the case.

25

But let me address the direct question.

statute is broad enough to cover the conduct in Florida,

reasonableness of the application of the statute, and

the private right of action in these circumstances.

The statute was intended to cover that kind of

Now, let's back up.

The general criticism

8

of these cases is that they are gotcha cases.

You put

in a little bit and all of a sudden the private bar

10

comes and attacks you.

11

Well, the stereotype is wrong and it's important to

12

understand why the stereotype is wrong.

13

you have is a very modest investment in the ADR market,

14

1 percent like my friends from NAB, those cases get

15

bounced at the beginning on personal jurisdiction as

16

they did in the district of New Jersey in SCORS and the

17

18

all you've got is that little toehold that you stay in.

You get bounced by -- on personal jurisdiction.

we know the answer to one of the threshold questions,

which is:

8

That can be handled and it is being handled on a daily

basis, notwithstanding, you know, some stereotypes.

Should this case be in our system or not?

10

Now, my final point with respect to

11

Professor Sachs' articles and some of the other articles

12

is they in effect -- if they advocate a rule, which many

13

of them do, which it should be limited to exchanges,

14

that goes back to my threshold point of the scope of the

15

statute.

16

says:

17

foreign or interstate commerce or through the mails;

18

it's limited, contrary to the express words of the

statute, in a way that the statutory construction we

don't believe can stand it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE T. CONWAY, III,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5
6

MR. CONWAY:

and may it please the Court:

7
8

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

The judgment of the court of appeals should
be affirmed for two reasons.

9

First, Petitioners have identified nothing

10

in the text of section 10(b) that overcomes the

11

presumption against extraterritoriality or the Charming

12

Betsy Rule.

13

to apply to transactions and shares of foreign issuers

14

on foreign exchanges.

15

The statutes should thus be construed not

Second, unlike the rights of action that

16

this Court has addressed in other extraterritoriality

17

cases, the section 10(b) right is purely implied.

18

Congress didn't intend for this right of action to exist

19

even domestically, let alone extraterritorially.

20

Given the threat that the section 10(b}

21

implied right presents to the sovereign authority of

22

other nations, as reflected in the amicus briefs of

23

Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and the

24

diplomatic note from the Swiss government, the Court

25

should construe the implied right not to extend to

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

claims of purchasers and sellers of securities of

2

foreign issuers on foreign markets.
The two clear statement rules are,

3
4

obviously, the presumption against extraterritoriality

5

and the Charming Betsy Rule require that the Congress.

6

Both require an affirmative intention of the Congress

7

clearly expressed before the statute can be applied to

8

apply to foreign transactions or to, you know, matters

9

that it infringes on the sovereign authority on other

10

nations.
My friends don't identify anything in the

11
12

statute that comets even close to a clear statement.

13

They principally rely on the definition of "interstate

14

commerce," but as this court said in Aramco, that kind

15

of boilerplate simply doesn't suffice to overcome the

16

presumption against extraterritoriality.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what is your test for

18

whether -- whether it's being applied internationally or

19

not?

20

MR. CONWAY:

Well, our test is that, at a

21

minimum, section 10b should be held not to apply to

22

transactions involving shares of foreign issues on

23

foreign exchanges, because that presents the greatest

24

danger of conflict of foreign law, particularly in the

25

context of the modern section 10b implied right, which

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has the fraud on the market presumption and holds

2

issuers liable, as here for example, for two and a half

3

years of trading, all on an Australian exchange.

4

is massive transfer of wealth that the Petitioners here

5

are seeking an American court to effect, and that is -­

6

basically, it's a direct form of market regulation that

7

Australia has not seen fit to impose upon itself.

MR. CONWAY:

Well, I think that -- I think

the problem is, in order to have that conduct swept

within the statute, you have to ignore the language and

15

the presumption against extraterritoriality.
If you go to petition appendix 78, that has

16
17

its text in section 10b, and section 10b refers to the

18

use or employment of any manipulative device or

19

contrivance, and it's in connection with the purchase or

20

sale of any security registered on a national securities

21

MR. CONWAY:

15

I think they do.

I think they

look to -- I think their view is that the statute is

vague and you have to do essentially what Judge Friendly

18

did and the Seventh Circuit did for many years, is you

19

have to make do and decide what the best rule is.

20

with respect to the government, that is essentially

21

doing what this Court has said under the presumption

22

against extraterritoriality the Court shouldn't do.

7

MR. CONWAY:

Your Honor, I think the problem

8

with the government's test and with the Second Circuit's

9

test, is that it would still allow the application of

10

U.S. law in a manner that would infringe the sovereign

11

authority of other nations.

12

There was a case

13

over the summer that the Petitioners attached to their

And it's a case called PC shifts.

facts if you had -- altering according to the

hypothetical, you had U.S. plaintiffs who purchased

National Australia Bank ADRs on the New York exchange,

4

you don't doubt that they can sue, do you?

5

MR. CONWAY:

No, and in fact, we told the

7

extraterritoriality grounds the claims of Mr. Morrison,

8

who inexplicably is still here.

9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
MR. CONWAY:

Right.

We argued that Mr. Morrison's

11

claims should be defeated on the grounds that he had no

damages, which was an absolutely ironclad calculation

13

best based on a -- on a provision of the PSLRA, and we

14

also argued that all of the claims should be dismissed

15

for failure to plead fraud with the requisite

16

particularity of the PSLRA.

17

But we certainly do not dispute that when a

company like ours registers shares on -- registers

12

13

presumption against extraterritoriality applied because

14

what would happen is, a single act of supply would

15

result in a springboard for liability each time a -- a

16

disk was put into a computer abroad.

17

And that is exactly analogous to the

18

circumstances in this case, where what we -- what

19

happened was some -- some allegedly false information

20

was transmitted to Australia; it was then republished in

21

annual reports, print, print, print; sent out to the -­

22

sent out to the Australian market, and resulted in -­

liability every single time somebody purchased -­

And so that

2

is exactly analogous to -- to Microsoft v. AT&T.
Again, another point I think that's relevant

3
4

is the, section 30 of the Exchange Act.

Congress did

5

not make a clear statement in section 10.

6

clear statements in section 30.

7

8

9

makes it -- makes -- gives the SEC power to promulgate

It did make

Section 30(a) addresses
Section 30 as a

11

who effect transactions of securities on foreign

12

exchanges, if those transactions are transactions of

13

shares of shares of U.S. issuers.
And that's at -- for reference, the text of

14
15

section 30 is at page 19 of the law professors' brief.

16

And section 30(b) also, it says that the SEC can

17

regulate the -- regulate businesses in securities of -­

18

of businesses -- securities that are abroad, but only to

19

the extent the SEC finds it necessary to prevent evasion

of the Act domestically.

that -- that a reading of the rule that would allow -- a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIE,

8

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

9
10

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents two distinct questions:

11
12

First whether the fraud alleged by Petitioners violated

13

Section 10b; and second, whether Petitioners may bring a

14

private action.
In our view, the alleged fraud violated

15
16

Section 10b, because significant conduct material to the

17

fraud's success occurred in the United States.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There are -- there

19

are a lot of moving parts in that test.

20

significant conduct, material, you require it to have a

21

direct causal relationship.

22

that kind of defeat the whole purpose?
MR. ROBERTS:

23

You know,

Doesn't the complication of

No, Your Honor, we don't think

MR. ROBERTS:

If -- if -- the critical

17

question is whether there's significant conduct here

18

that's material to the broad success.

19

for that is if Section 10b didn't cover that kind of

20

conduct, then that would risk allowing the United States

21

to become a base for orchestrating securities frauds for

22

export.

What's bothering me, taking off from what the

22

Chief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test.

23

Your test, it seems to me on causation, would say that

when you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue.

Florida to any degree, they just directly copied them,

some low-level clerk directly copied them, would the

4

direct cause test be met?

5

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, if the action was just

6

ministerial over overseas, it would -- it would be met.

7

Again, the critical question, in our view, under the

8

direct cause test is, was there culpable conduct in the

9

United States that is directly responsible for the

10

plaintiff's injury?

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Roberts -­
Well, then you give no

13

weight to the fact that it was on the Australian

exchange?

15

MR. ROBERTS:

The -- the fact that the

16

transaction happens on the Australian exchange is not

17

dispositive, because if -- if somebody in the United

18

States is directly -- is -- is executing the fraud -- if

19

it turned on just a transaction on the Australian

20

exchange, then a domestic investor could be injured by a

21

fraud that is hatched entirely here that is executed

22

entirely here, and he is tricked into executing a

23

transaction on an overseas exchange.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Roberts, because your

time is running out, there is a basic question here.

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

You are asking us to make a distinction between what the

2

SEC can sue for and what a private party can sue for.

3

Congress did that with respect to aiders and abettors.

4

Is there any other instance in which we have

5

made a distinction, yes, the SEC has a claim but the

6

private litigant doesn't?

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, the -- the -- the private

8

litigants are -- have numerous elements that they have

9

to show that the SEC doesn't have to show:

Reliance,

10

loss, loss causation.

All of those go to the causal

11

link between the injury and -- and the fraud.

12

think that the direct injury requirement is an

13

appropriate application of those more general causation

14

requirements in the context of transnational fraud.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

And we

I am frankly less concerned

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have any

10

indication that our friends around the world are

11

comfortable with your test?
MR. ROBERTS:

12

Well, the briefs that have

As to the Leasco example and Bersch example,
