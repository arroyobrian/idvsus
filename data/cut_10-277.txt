Mr. Boutrous.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BOUTROUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The mandatory nationwide class in this case

12

was improperly certified for two fundamental reasons.

13

First, plaintiffs failed to satisfy Rule 23(a)'s

14

cohesion requirements as reflected in the commonality,

15

typicality, and adequacy requirements of the rule.

16

Second, plaintiffs' highly individualized claims for

17

monetary relief failed to satisfy Rule 23(b)(2)'s

18

requirements for certification of a mandatory

19

non-opt-out class.

20

Regarding Rule 23(a), because the

21

plaintiffs' claims in this case hinge on the delegation

22

of discretion to individual managers throughout the

23

country, they cannot meet the cohesion requirements that

24

are reflected in -- in Rule 23(a).

25

discretion in some ways is the opposite of cohesive

The delegation of

claims that are common to everyone in the class.

2

common policies that the plaintiffs point to are either

strong policy against discrimination and in favor of

The

The company has a very

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose if

8

corporate headquarters had learned that the subjective

decisionmaking or the delegation of decisionmaking to

the field was resulting in several discriminatory

11

practices or a pattern of discrimination -- in other

12

words, the decentralized process was leading to

13

discrimination -- then I suppose the company -- that

14

that could be attributed to the policy adopted by -- at

15

headquarters?

16

MR. BOUTROUS:

No, Your Honor.

I think that

17

in this situation, if there was a pattern, for example,

at a particular store where the decisionmaking unit -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I'm talking

20

about -- so, they've got thousands of stores, and, you

21

know, every week they get a report from another store

22

saying that, you know, there's an allegation of gender

23

discrimination.

24

it is their policy of decentralizing decisionmaking that

25

is causing or permitting that discrimination to take

5

everyone in the same way.

6

at the -- the situation throughout the company and seek

7

to root out discrimination, but it would take more than

8

some reports, especially in -- in a company that has so

9

many stores and so many units.

10

I don't think it would rise to

Certainly, companies do look

And here, the plaintiffs' claims simply

11

aren't typical.

If the three named plaintiffs stand

12

before the court, they are supposed to represent 500,000

13

or a million or more people and stand in judgment -­

14

that's the words the Court used in Hansberry v. Lee -­

15

to represent all those other people.

16

that the individual decisionmakers in those other cases

17

exercised their discretion in a way that was biased, and

18

there's no proof of that.

And the claim is

The Chief Justice's

question reminds me somewhat of our rule in Monell under

24

we could use that as an analogue to determine whether or

25

not there is a common question here?

A city is not liable for a -- a constitutional

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Would you think that

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. BOUTROUS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think the

2

analogue is that if a company had a policy, a general

3

policy, of discrimination as opposed to here, where it's

4

a general policy against discrimination, and it was -­

5

in the words of the Court in Feeney, saw patterns

6

throughout the company and because of sex, because of

7

gender, continued to allow the patterns to exist, that

8

would raise a different question.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose, following the

Monell analogue, there's -- it's a -- there's a showing

of deliberate indifference to the violation.

MR. BOUTROUS:

Would that

Your Honor, I think

14

deliberate indifference raises a different question.

15

Under a disparate treatment claim, again, in Feeney, the

16

test would be, was the company allowing the

17

discrimination to occur because of gender, because it

wanted there to be discrimination?

over for promotion, and there is a pay gap between men

25

and women doing the same job.

The company gets reports month after

It happens not once, but

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

twice.

Isn't there some responsibility on the company

2

to say, is gender discrimination at work, and if it is,

3

isn't there an obligation to stop it?

4

MR. BOUTROUS:

Your Honor, yes, there is an

5

obligation to ensure -- for a company to do its best to

6

ensure there are not wage gaps and discrimination.

7

here, for example, if one looks at the aggregated

8

statistics that the plaintiffs have pointed to, it

9

points to a completely different issue.

It does not

10

show that there were gender gaps at the stores among

11

comparable people.

12

in their case.

13

But

That's really the fundamental flaw

Their argument is that individual

14

decisionmakers throughout the country were making

15

stereotyped decisions and that that had a common effect,

16

but they just added everything together.

17

18

19

mirror some of the -- the statistics that -­

They haven't

They've added all the

Counsel, I thought their

21

expert didn't aggregate them together.

22

regionally, not store by store, as your expert did,

23

number one; and, number two, that he performed, as

24

accepted by the district court, and affirmed by the

25

circuit court, any number of controlled variable

Alderson Reporting Company

He did it

comparisons, including job history, job ratings, and

2

other things, and found that the disparity could not be

3

explained on any of the normal variables that one would

4

expect and that the disparity was significantly much

5

higher than the 10 competitors of Wal-Mart and what they

6

were paying their labor force.

7

So, what is speculative about that, number

8

one?

9

inadequate to show that a policy of some sort exists?

10

And, two, why is that kind of statistical analysis

MR. BOUTROUS:

Justice Sotomayor, first,

11

plaintiffs' expert did a national regression and then

12

simply estimated the regional results.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We think we have

Well, that begs the

18

legal question, which is -- you're right.

19

you may win and prove to a factfinder that this analysis

20

is fatally flawed, but what the district court concluded

21

was that on the basis of your expert, whom he discounted

22

because your expert was -- was basing analysis on -- on

23

premises that the court found not acceptable, that there

24

was enough here after a rigorous analysis.

25

Ultimately,

What's the standard that the court should
8

Alderson Reporting Company

use in upsetting that factual conclusion?

2

MR. BOUTROUS:

Your Honor, the district

judge did not discount Wal-Mart's expert.

5

7

Circuit adopted in the IPO case, which says there needs

11

there has to be some demonstration that there's a common

13

testimony showed that at 90 percent of the stores, there

14

was no pay disparity.

15

even putting that aside, the plaintiffs needed to come

16

forward with something that showed that there was this

17

miraculous recurrence at every decision across every

18

store of stereotyping, and the evidence simply doesn't

19

show that.

2

these cases, if this were an individual case, they would

3

have to show that they were treated differently than

4

people who were situated just like them, with the same

5

supervisor, the same department, the same situation.

JUSTICE ALITO:

In each of

What do you think is the

7

difference between the standard that the district court

8

was required to apply at the certification stage on the

9

question whether there was a company-wide policy and the

10

-- the standard that would be applied on the merits?

11

MR. BOUTROUS:

At the certification stage,

12

Justice Alito, the plaintiffs did not have to prove that

13

there was an actual policy of discrimination and that

14

that was the company's policy, but they at least needed

15

to point to a policy that was common and that linked all

16

of these disparate individuals and disparate locations

17

and different people together.

18

argument is that the common policy is giving tens of

19

thousands of individuals discretion to do whatever they

20

want.

21

That is not commonality.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and one -- their

It's the opposite.

I don't think that's quite

22

fair, Mr. Boutrous.

I think their argument was that the

23

common policy was one of complete subjectivity, was one

24

of using factors that allowed gender discrimination to

25

come into all employment decisions.
10

Alderson Reporting Company

And in Watson, we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suggested that that was a policy, a policy of using

2

subjective factors only, when making employment

3

decisions.

4

here.

5

That's exactly the policy that was alleged

MR. BOUTROUS:

Justice Kagan, they do not

6

argue that it was an entirely subjective process.

7

the Court suggested in Falcon, entirely subjective

8

would -- would be a different issue.

9

was excessive subjectivity and that there were general

overarching company standards that exerted control.
On page -- I think it's on page 13 of their

12

brief, they say the discretion was unguided.

13

pages later they say it was guided by these

14

nondiscriminatory policies.

15

incoherent theory that does not have -- pose the kind of

16

situation you're suggesting.

17

Three

So, it's really an

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I guess I'm just a

18

little -- a little bit confused as to why excessive

19

subjectivity is not a policy that can be alleged in a

20

Title VII pattern and practice suit or in a Title VII

21

disparate impact suit.

22

MR. BOUTROUS:

Your Honor, in Watson, the

23

Court did suggest -- did state and -- and hold that

24

subjective decisionmaking could be challenged in a

25

disparate impact case, but Justice O'Connor's opinion
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

went on to say there needs to be the identification of a

2

specific practice within that policy.

3

As the Court said in Falcon, Title VII does

4

not govern policies; it governs practices.

And

5

subjectivity is not a practice if it were a policy.

6

there was a -- like most companies, Wal-Mart has a

7

combination of objective and subjective standards.

8

Within that, the plaintiffs -- if they had pointed to

9

some particular criteria, people with a great

And

10

personality, they're going to -- they're -- they're the

18

test, part objective, but then in the end, the final

19

step was a so-called total person test, and women

20

disproportionately flunked at that total person.

21

What was at issue there was a part -- a

And the idea wasn't at all complicated.

22

was that most people prefer themselves; and so, a

23

decisionmaker, all other things being equal, would

24

prefer someone that looked like him.

found, that total -- the application of that total
12

Alderson Reporting Company

And that was

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

This sounds quite similar.

I mean, it's not

3

just -- it's not subjective.

4

know you have some questions about that expert -- but

5

the expert saying that gender bias can creep into a

6

system like that simply because of the natural

7

phenomenon that people tend to feel comfortable with

8

people like themselves.

9

MR. BOUTROUS:

You have an expert -- I

Your Honor, this -- this is

10

not like the total person test, but I think that is a

11

very good example of something that could be a -- a

12

practice inside the -- the overarching policies, and if

13

you had a case where a particular decisionmaking unit

14

applied the total practice test, and you had disparate

15

results in that particular unit, that group of people

16

could -- could -- would have a much stronger case for a

17

class action.

18

But as Your Honor points out, the -- the

19

sociologist here, who is the glue that's supposed to

20

hold this class together, said he couldn't tell if

21

stereotyping was occurring one-half of 1 percent or 95

22

percent or at all.

23

And this is a class action.

The question

24

here is whether that we can assume that every

25

decisionmaker acted in the same manner in a way that had
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in this Court's words the same injury, caused -- the

2

plaintiffs had the same interest and the same injury,

3

that's the way the Court put it in Amchem, by their own

4

expert accepting all of their proof, the answer is no.

5

That assumption is not supported by the record.

6

why there's not the kind of cohesion that's necessary to

7

protect the rights of the absent class members and the

8

defendant.

9
10

That's

The -- the -- the other -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Boutrous, I think that

11

that suggests that the plaintiffs would have to

12

demonstrate discrimination in every individual case, and

13

that's never been the law.

14

to demonstrate and, especially at this stage in the

15

proceedings, is that there is a practice, a policy of

16

subjectivity that on the whole results in discrimination

17

against women, not that each one of these women in the

18

class were themselves discriminated against.

19

MR. BOUTROUS:

All that the plaintiffs have

That's correct, Your Honor.

20

At the phase one, we're not arguing that a plaintiff

21

would have to come forward and show that every class

22

member was discriminated at that point.

23

Teamsters' analysis, there must be proof of a standard

24

operating procedure of discrimination.

25

Under the

Here, it's undisputed that Wal-Mart's
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

policy -- and it wasn't just a written policy; it was

2

implemented and enforced rigorously -- that was

3

antidiscrimination.

4

that each person doesn't have to come forward in phase

5

one.

6

But, Your Honor, you're correct,

The big -- the other big problem here is

7

that the district judge said in phase two, under

8

Teamsters, Wal-Mart would not be entitled to put on its

9

individual defenses.

Women who thought they had a claim

10

would not be able to come forward if a -- in this

11

process, the paper records suggested they didn't have a

12

claim, and come into court and have their day in court

13

and argue that they should be compensated.

14

The plaintiffs are trying to cut off half of

15

the Teamsters' framework, which is fundamental both to

16

due process and to Title VII because Title VII's section

17

706(g) states very clearly that only victims of

18

discrimination may recover.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what happens

to the damages claim of an individual woman who is part

of this class if that class prevails?

22

MR. BOUTROUS:

If the class prevails, then

the -- the claim would be resolved in this manner

under -- it's very unclear what the District Court had

in mind.

is a fundamental, crucial violation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All right.

But

14

would -- would the -- would the women with a claim for

15

compensatory damages be able to sue that after the class

prevails in this case?

nucleus of facts in the case.

Our view is the plaintiffs

will -- will not be able to satisfy those -- those

provisions, but that's why they brought it under Rule

Meaning if their claim is, as they state

it, that they're seeking injunctive and declaratory

relief against a discriminatory impact or -- case or a

pattern and practice case, wouldn't that have value and

21

wouldn't that value be, standing alone without the

22

damages component, be that the plaintiffs who come in

It would certainly be better than this,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, would you address

the -- address them separately for me, and tell me why a

22

(b)(2) class couldn't exist only on injunctive relief?

23

And if it can, if you're conceding it can, then is your

attack merely that the monetary component of this, the

Alderson Reporting Company

or not -- why that just can't be separated out and put

MR. BOUTROUS:

the injunctive relief claim still has significant

problems concerning cohesion, adequacy, typicality,

commonality.

MR. SELLERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

position -- I don't know that that's a fair comparison.

3

The position that Wal-Mart has advanced makes no -- the

4

comparison it makes is with the general population, not

5

with people in retail.

6

Wal-Mart's obligation under Title VII is to

7

ensure that its managers do not make pay decisions

because of sex, and the comparison that's relevant is

between men and women at Wal-Mart, not the general

population that includes people in retail, but includes

railroad workers and all kinds of other people.

It's not clear to me:

What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted,

MR. SELLERS:

Justice Kennedy, our theory is

17

that Wal-Mart provided to its managers unchecked

discretion in the way that this Court's Watson decision

19

addressed that was used to pay women less than men who

20

were doing the same work in the same -- the same

facilities at the same time, even though -- though those

women had more seniority and higher performance, and

MR. SELLERS:

Well, the -- the approach that

5

the District Court endorsed, an approach we recommended,

6

and which has been endorsed by seven circuits over a

7

period of 40 years, is in circumstances here -- like

8

here, which are, admittedly, the exception to the rule,

9

where the company had no standards by which to make

10

promotion and pay decisions, they had kept no records of

11

who -- the reasons for people being promoted and the

12

reasons why they pay people certain amounts, that as a

13

consequence of that, the Albemarle decision and the

14

Teamsters decision make clear that the obligation of the

15

District Court upon finding of liability is to attempt

16

to reconstruct the decisions that would have been made

17

in the absence of discrimination.

18

And the District Court found here -- and we

19

submit it's not clearly erroneous -- that the more

20

reliable method for doing so is to use a formula relying

21

on Wal-Mart's robust database in which it captures

22

performance, seniority, and a host of other job-related

23

variables, factors that bear on pay and promotion

24

decisions, and permits a comparison, a very precise

25

comparison, in a way that having individual hearings

situation where you had a company with a very clear

question was women don't have as many positions because

managers discriminate against them in -- in hiring and

would be uncompensated?

12

MR. SELLERS:

Actually, Justice Ginsburg,

13

I -- I think the district judge did not find that.

14

he found was that the formula, and I can assure you the

15

formula we intend -- would tend -- tend to use is a

16

regression analysis that would permit a comparison

17

between each woman and the amount she was paid and

18

similarly situated men, taking into account, as I said,

19

performance and seniority and the like, and you will

20

find there are women that were not underpaid and the

21

formula will show that they should get no back pay.

22

I think that the district court -­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What

I thought -- I thought

his point was not simply that some women were not

25

underpaid, but women, if you had an individual case, the

employer might show this person could have been fired,

disciplined, and wasn't owed any back pay, not that she

compares favorably to a -- a male peer, but that she

4

wouldn't have gotten any pay at all.

5

MR. SELLERS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

6

kind of factors that are entered into this -- this

7

economic model, performance in particular, should

8

capture whether somebody should have been fired.

9

That -- that is a very important part of the model here

that permits people to -- and we found -- the evidence

11

shows that women were, in fact -- had higher performance

12

than men and were nonetheless still underpaid.

here?

call that, of course, we leave -- we should leave to the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One thing you haven't

of whether (b)(2) is limited to injunction and

not an action or inaction is taken with respect to the

depends on -- it doesn't depend on the number of people
