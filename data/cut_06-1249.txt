CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 06-1249, Wyeth v. Levine.

5

Mr. Waxman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case concerns conflict pre-emption

11

under the Supremacy Clause, and the conflict presented

12

here is stark.

13

approved Phenergan injection as safe and effective under

14

all the conditions and methods of use described in the

15

labeling, including what is referred to as "IV push"

16

injection.

17

that the FDA had considered, determined that the precise

18

labeling that FDA had required Wyeth to use in fact

19

rendered Phenergan "unreasonably dangerous."

20

Repeatedly over the years, the FDA

Yet a State jury, evaluating the same risk

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That -

Just at the outset, I'll

21

just make one comment.

You argue that it's impossible

22

for Wyeth to comply with the State law and at the same

23

time the Federal label.

24

logical matter, I just -- I don't understand that.

25

think I could design a label that's completely

As a textual matter, as a

3

I

consistent and that meets the requirements that the

2

Respondents wish to urge.

3

Now, if you want to say that any alteration

4

of the label violates Federal law, that's something

5

else.

6

a semantic matter, I don't agree with it.

But as a textual matter, as a logical matter, as

7

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, let me make sure, because

8

I do think we do agree, and I want to make sure that I'm

9

understood, Justice Kennedy.

I think what you've

10

articulated is the test which is, is it possible for a

11

regulated party to comply at the same time with both

12

Federal law and State law?

13

use, as they were required by Federal law to do, to use

14

the precise label that in approving the application in

15

1998 the FDA required Wyeth to use, and also use the

16

label that the Vermont jury determined should be used,

17

and that was stated in the complaint and in the opening

18

and the closing a statement that you may not, should not

19

use IV administration or IV push, in other words that

20

you should contra -- the label should contra-indicate

21

something -

In other words, could they

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman -

didn't say IV across the board.

It didn't say -- it
It said IV push is the

4

claim, and that was -- as I understand this, the FDA was

2

aware of the IV use and a certain risk.

3

ever, ever discreetly consider IV push versus IV

4

administered the usual way by a drip bag?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

But did it

Yes it did, Justice Ginsburg,

6

and I want to cite you to the portions of the record

7

that demonstrate that it did.

8

just want to underscore a point that I think is clear

9

from both our brief and the Solicitor General's brief,

But before I do so, I

10

which is that isn't the test of preemption in any event.

11

The question is what did the labeling say and upon what

12

information was the labeling decision made.

13

But as to your particular question, there

14

are -- first of all, there was testimony in the record

15

from multiple parties, including experts from both

16

sides, that the FDA was aware of all of the forms of

17

administration and the risk, including IV push.

18

experts simply disagreed with the judgment that the

19

labeling requires.

20

this case, which is reproduced, in sort of microscopic

21

size unfortunately, on the last two pages of the

22

petitioner appendix and the last two pages of the joint

23

appendix, have four separate reference that, as we

24

explained in footnote 11 of our reply brief, only apply

25

to IV push.

Their

But most saliently, the labeling in

There is a reference to the use of the Tubex

system.

That is a direct IV push system.

There is a

reference to rigid plungers and small-bore needles.

Again nothing to do with drip.

5

a maximum rate of administration.

6

testimony in the case was that an instruction that a

7

11

context of a needle that is being used to push something

12

into a vein, is not reliable in the context of this case

13

because Phenergan discolors arterial blood immediately.

14

So the labeling plainly comprehended and

15

warned about the specific risks of IV push

16

administration, and that's not all.

17

advisory -- an advisory committee in 1976 was asked to

18

look at precisely the risk of arterial exposure to

19

Phenergan injection or any other irritant drug that is

20

administered intravenously and it made specific

21

recommendations, including recommendations that go

22

directly to IV push.

JUSTICE ALITO:

There is an

2

and on the risk side you have the risk of gangrene?

3

MR. WAXMAN:

I mean, there was testimony --

4

Justice Alito, I can go over the testimony, but there

5

is -- there was testimony in this very case about those

6

very circumstances in which direct IV injection is

7

indicated.

evidence in the FDA record, including if you look at the

1987 correspondence that the FDA sent to Wyeth in the

14

specifically address the circumstances in which IV push

15

administration is an important tool.

16

I think, that -

amputation is there.

20

how could the benefit outweigh that substantial risk?

21

No matter what benefit there was,

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, this is

22

labeling that is directed at medical professionals.

23

is labeling that is directed at physicians, who have to

24

be able to determine what method, what pharmaceutical

25

and what method of administration to use, given the

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The FDA was never

concerned with risks versus benefit?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

The FDA -- well, the FDA

6

certainly is.

And the issue, Justice Kennedy, here is

7

the FDA has to decide what information to provide to

8

clinicians so that they can make judgments about what to

9

use.

And it -- what it did here is it provided ample,

10

lavish warnings about the risk of intra-arterial

11

injection and exposure of an irritant drug like

12

Phenergan to arterial blood.

13

labeling to the physicians a cascading hierarchy of

14

methods of administration.

15

injection is the preferred method.

16

respect to intravenous injection that it is, as with any

17

irritant drug, it is usually preferable to inject it

18

into an IV infusion set that is known to be running

19

properly, in other words where a line has already been

20

established into the vein and the IV push occurs into

21

the line that's already established.

It provided in the

It said intramuscular

All that information was available to

23

physicians and the FDA has to understand and does

understand that in labeling to allow medical

4

the table and what's off the table and in terms of

what's on the table what the relevant risks are is, is

this ever -- would this ever be medically warranted?

7

The testimony in this case and in the administrative

record was yes, there are circumstances -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It may

What the FDA

I'd like you to

10

address the distinction between the medical device area

11

and the drug area because in the medical device area, of

12

course, you have an express pre-emption clause, while

13

here in contrast you don't.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

I mean, I think,

15

Mr. Chief Justice, you've identified the respect in

16

which this is difference than the medical device area.

17

But for the salient purposes, I think the Riegel case

18

directly points the Court to the nature of the

19

determination that the FDA makes with respect to class 3

20

drugs.

21

As we pointed out in our brief and as I think Justice

22

Scalia's opinion in Riegel points out, the balancing

23

time-intensive, data- intensive inquiry for medical

24

devices was patterned after what is done for drugs, and

25

it reflects a balancing of risks and benefits of the

It goes through the same preclearance process.

particular drug in light of the conditions and methods

2

of administration prescribed in the labeling.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If that's true you

4

would have expected the Federal Drug Act to have a

5

similar express pre-emption provision.

6

perhaps that it didn't is that when the Drug Act was

7

passed you had an established background of State

8

actions; when the Medical Device Act was passed you

9

didn't.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

And one reason

Well, let me address both the

11

established background of State actions and then the

12

pre-emption clause difference, if I may.

13

and her amici have identified 97 cases going back 150

14

years in which tort actions have been brought with

15

respect to pharmaceuticals.

16

and they are recent -- are implicated by the rule that

17

the Vermont Supreme Court applied in this case, which is

18

where a fully informed FDA, informed of all the

19

information that Wyeth had, approved a labeling

20

standard, but a court looking at the same evidence can

21

reach a different conclusion about what is on the label.

22

The most -- those cases I believe all post-date

23

Cipollone.

24

count, there are fewer than 20 such cases out of all of

25

the cases that have been decided and those issues -

The Respondent

Very few of those cases -

Many of them postdate Geier.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

And by my

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that issue had never come up and never could have come

2

up when Congress enacted the 1938 Act, because it was

3

only the 1938 Act that established a drug-specific,

4

preclearance regime, and really in 1962, in which the

5

FDA was required not just to evaluate safety in terms of

6

licensing the distribution of the drug, but to balance

7

safety against effectiveness.

8

And so the -- the constellation of common

9

law cases -- I mean, let me just say we are -- we are

10

not seeking here a rule of field preemption.

11

seeking to preclude tort remedies for conduct that

12

violates Federal law.

13

We are not

What we are saying here is -- and this goes,

14

I think, finally to your point about the express

15

pre-emption clause -- the presence of expressed

16

pre-emption clauses or the absence, the presence of a

17

savings clause or the absence, does not and cannot

18

affect the operation of conflict pre-emption under the

19

Federal Constitution.

20

Now, members of this Court are concerned

21

about applying a broad, vague, or free-wheeling analysis

22

of implied conflict pre-emption, but this case is

23

heartland.

24

25

the FDA just didn't allow, the FDA required Wyeth to

A jury was asked to look at the same

Alderson Reporting Company

use, rendered that drug unreasonably unsafe.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it required it

3

because that is what the FDA had approved as a label.

4

But as -- excuse me -- as I understand it, the -- the

5

company, Wyeth, could have gone back to the FDA at any

6

time and said, either based on experience or just our

7

rethinking of the data that we have, we think the label

8

ought to be changed to say "Don't use IV push."

9

could have done that at any time, and it simply didn't

10

Wyeth

do it.

11

And the -- the reason I raise this is

12

because it could have done it at any time, where, going

13

back to Justice Kennedy's first question, where is the

14

conflict?

15

MR. WAXMAN:

The liability in this case was

16

not predicated on the fact that Wyeth didn't go to the

17

-- remember, the FDA had approved this label two years

18

before Miss Levine was injured.

19

it rejected stronger proposed language that Wyeth had

20

presented.

In approving the label,

There was nothing that was -- Wyeth was -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But as I understand it,

22

Wyeth's argument is not this argument.

23

saying the reason there is a conflict here is that we

24

tried to give the kind of warning that the Vermont jury,

25

in effect, says we should have given and the FDA didn't
12

Wyeth is not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

allow us to do it, so that, in fact, there is a conflict

2

between a specific rejection by the FDA of the Vermont

3

rule and the rule that the Vermont jury applied.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

As I understand it, Wyeth's

6

argument is:

Whatever is on the label, in fact, is the

7

standard of conflict.

8

tried or could have tried or didn't try.

9

look at the label and you look at what the Vermont jury

It doesn't matter whether we
You simply

10

did; and if there is a -- if there is a difference

11

between them, there is a conflict.

12

your argument?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Am I right about

Yes, you are right.

We -- we

14

have both an impossibility form of conflict because, in

old information, we could not make the change in advance

of getting approval.

18

objects-and-purposes form of conflict pre-emption

19

because the Vermont jury decided on the same information

20

that the labeling that the FDA had approved and required

21

was unreasonably unsafe.

And we also have an -- an

And we cannot have a world in which the very

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kneedler, at the

5

outset, would you clarify something that is central, I

think, to this case?

7

this represents a change of policy on the part of the

8

FDA, that in fact the FDA once approved and said torts

were -- tort suits were a helpful adjunct to the FDA's

Some of the briefs tell us that

10

own efforts to protect consumers.

11

they prodded manufacturers to -- to disclose risks that

12

were either unknown or under- evaluated.

the FDA's policy; and, if so, when did it change?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

They helped because

Was that once

The -- the FDA, to my

15

knowledge, has never taken the position that -- that, as

16

a general matter, a manufacturer may change a label

justifies a revision.

19

relied primarily on some snippets of rule-making

proceedings and things like that in which FDA has

Well, the position we are

if I could just explain why.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think You mean if you failed to

provide the FDA the new information that you think

negates the provisions on the -- on the label, you still

20

couldn't be sued?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

If you -- if you failed

22

to provide it altogether, there would not be a -- a

23

pre-emption defense if there were -- if your

that you didn't furnish.

about that:

16

that there is pre-emption in a situation where there is

new information that is not brought to FDA's attention.

18

The first is, as I said, we are not arguing

But the second point is that in the 2007

amendments to the Act, Congress recognized the

20

difficulties with this and gave FDA important new

21

enforcement tools and resources to go after the problem

22

of things that arise after a drug is improved -

change in the label, which it did not have before.

It has given the FDA the authority to order

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

As FDA explained in 2008,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

depends upon the accrual of new information.

12

old, as I understand it, on your argument raises this

MR. FREDERICK:

I think that the dispute is

15

-- is what constitutes new information, because we don't

16

take issue with the notion that new information can be

17

new analysis of prior submitted data; and what the

19

there was a lot of unpublished information about the

6

Would you still -- would she

And the

7

reason it would be pre-empted is because the FDA would

have considered and rejected on the basis of the same

information or similar information the very duty that

that whenever it's not safe it's misbranded.

19
20
21

MR. FREDERICK:

I mean -

I'm not going to retract

that, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- which is it?

Whenever

22

it's not safe, it's misbranded, or what you just

23

responded to Justice Souter?

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

The basis -- the basis of

the FDA's approval is on the basis of limited
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

information, which Congress has said for public safety

2

reasons -- we are not doing a balancing here; we are

3

doing this for public safety -

4
5

And if the label is not adequate for public
safety it is a misbranded drug.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but if -- if the

7

so-called misbranding is determined to be misbranding,

8

based upon information which was given to the FDA, as I

9

understand your position, you would admit that there was

10

pre-emption.

11

MR. FREDERICK:

I -- I think there is

12

pre-emption, but that does not mean -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. FREDERICK:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

So there -

Maybe there is no In other words, there is

16

that one exception at least to the broad statement that

17

you gave in answer to Justice Scalia?

MR. FREDERICK:

Let me try to untangle it

this way.

cannot bring as State law failure-to-warn claim doesn't

22

standard the FDA -

But the -- but the

misbranding is of no consequence to liability.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, if 39

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In other words, I think

2

you're saying if there -- if there would be pre-emption

3

it may be misbranded, but there cannot be any recovery

4

in a State tort suit.

5
6

MR. FREDERICK:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

So misbranding under

those circumstances is a purely theoretical concept.

9
10

The -- the

point -

7
8

That's correct.

MR. FREDERICK:

In that very hypothetical,

yes.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. FREDERICK:

Okay.
But the point is that the

13

failure is that the failure-to-warn claim tracks the

14

misbranding provision; and if you look at the jury

15

instructions in this case, the wording is very close to

16

the wording of the misbranding provision in terms of the

17

adequacy of the warning that must be provided.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

MR. FREDERICK:

20
21

Mr. Frederick All State law is doing is

providing a remedy that is absent from Federal law.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Frederick, I'd like to

22

put the misbranding point to one side and just

23

concentrate on pre-emption.

24

agree with Justice Alito that there is a hypothetical

25

case in which there would be pre-emption, and would you

And I understood you to

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

tell me what particular fact distinguishes your case

2

from his hypothetical?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

The fact is there was no

4

consideration and rejection of a stronger IV push

5

warning.

6

push as a means of administration distinct from other

7

intravenous forms that would lead to a different kind of

8

risk-benefit balancing.

9

where there would be pre-emption, FDA would be asked, we

There was no consideration by the FDA of IV

So with the -- in the case

10

-- we want to put a stronger warning as against this --

11

FDA says:

12

Do not put that warning on the label.

13

We don't think there is scientific evidence.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So now, your friends

14

on the other side said there was specific consideration

15

of IV push as opposed to simply arterial exposure, and

16

that that is laid forth in the labeling.

17

understood your answer to be, all we have to do is

18

simply look at the record, and if we think the FDA

19

considered specifically IV push risks as opposed to

20

general arterial exposure, then you lose, and if we

21

determine that they did not, then they lose.

22
23
24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

So, as I

Court was quite emphatic about this, Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I don't know

if the Vermont Supreme Court was emphatic about it.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mean, the record is either -- addresses the FDA -- I'm

2

more interested in what the FDA was emphatic about, and

3

they either address IV push separately or they don't.

4

MR. FREDERICK:

And you search in the joint

5

appendix in vain for communications between Wyeth and

6

FDA communicating about the particular risks of IV push.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- can you turn to

8

the references that Mr. Waxman and Mr. Kneedler made?

9

They said oh, yes, IV push was considered discretely

10
11

from IV drip bags.
MR. FREDERICK:

I will acknowledge that the

12

references in some instances suggest IV push.

13

no doubt that the FDA knew that IV push was a method of

14

intravenous administration, but our point is a starker

15

one, and that is that the FDA never was put to the test

16

of deciding comparative risks and benefits of IV push

17

versus IV drip.

18

because the catastrophic risks of IV push are so

19

dramatic, no reasonable person could have made a safety

20

determination to allow this drug with its risks when

21

there are corresponding benefits that create exactly the

22

same kind of treatment of care for the patient.

23

There is

And it's that point that is crucial,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is your argument that

24

they couldn't have considered these comparative risks,

25

because if they had, they would have come out
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

differently; because they didn't come out differently,

2

we have to infer that they didn't consider it?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

It's two things:

4

didn't consider it and that's clearly -

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. FREDERICK:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

One, they

No, I Second,
Apart from your analysis

8

that they couldn't have or they would have come out

9

differently, how did we know that they didn't consider

10
11

it?
MR. FREDERICK:

There are communications

12

that went back and forth between the company.

13

set out in the joint appendix.

14

to IV push risks as distinct from -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

These are

They make no reference

And do these -- when you

16

say "communications," do you mean starting with the

17

original application for approval of the label?

18

MR. FREDERICK:

The original application

19

actually is not known.

20

This drug was approved in 1955.

21

original label was, Justice Souter.

22

It wasn't in Wyeth's files.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We don't know where the

So, you are saying all the

23

correspondence that we do know about, that is extant,

24

fails to mention comparative risk.

25

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.
43

Alderson Reporting Company

And -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the label doesn't.

I

2

mean, the label ask discusses the high risk from IV push

3

and sets forth particular cautions for that -- for that

4

specific means of administration.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

It does not, Justice Scalia.

6

The label says -- it's talking about intravenous

7

administration.

8

and IV push.

9

based on the label, he would not have been able to make

It does not distinguish between IV drip

And Dr. Matthew testified at trial that,

a treatment determination to distinguish between the

11

two, and that had he had that information, he clearly

12

would have given this drug to Diana Levine through the

13

intravenous drip method.

The label simply didn't -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we conclude that new

15

information is the criterion for deciding this case, if

16

we reject the argument that misbranding at the outset

17

allows State law to supplement the duty, but that if

18

there's new information, then the label has to be

19

changed -- if it that's the line we draw, can this

20

verdict be sustained?

more elaborately in the trial record itself, which makes

clear that Wyeth knew or should have known about these

comparative risks.

Federal standards as well as the State duty of due care.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this:

When did

14

the duty on the part of Wyeth to have a different label

15

arise, in your view?

MR. FREDERICK:

17

the early '70s when a -- when there was a published -

18

or there was an incident -

Did it arise before or

after submitting the original drug application?

made that it would have been before the 1970s

These are old

We don't have evidence from the 1950s that would

Alderson Reporting Company

1

1955 would have caused a difference but certainly by the

2

1970s when -- when Wyeth was reformatting this as an old

3

drug to comply with new standards, it should have known

4

and it certainly should have known by the 1990s when

5

several amputations had occurred from IV push Phenergan,

6

which were in Wyeth's files.

7

these records, you know, were emphatic that Wyeth knew

8

or should have known by the 1990s.

9

by the testimony of experts that -- that showed the

10

comparison between Vistrol and Phenergan and on the

11

basis of the IV push injuries that had occurred that

12

were nonpublished.

13

to FDA, but Wyeth never took the trouble to do the

14

synthesis, to connect the dots between these very

15

terrible tragedies that had occurred from its drug, to

16

bring about a labeling change or a modification that

17

would have saved lives.

18

part of the manufacturer not to comply with its

19

standards of due care and with the regulations which

20

require health risk information to be the basis of

21

modifications to the labeling.

22

The people who analyzed

And that was clear

They appeared to have been reported

And that is a failure on the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Does that boil down to a

23

claim that there was new information that was available

24

between the original approval and the time of the

25

lawsuit?
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, by "original

2

approval," do you mean 1955 or do you mean in 1998 and

3

2000?

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Either one.

But is your

5

theory really a theory based on new information or new

6

judgment about old information?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

It would be on the basis, I

8

think, of both.

I think we would be able to establish

9

that there was a justification on the basis of

10

information before the reformatted labeling took place,

11

and that was testimony by Dr. Green at trial on the

12

basis of Vistrol, the other amputation that had occurred

13

with Phenergan in 1965.

14

And the -- the important point here is that

15

on the basis of new information, if you are going to

16

conclude that there is a standard that has to be met, I

17

would urge you to consider two things:

18

burden of showing absence of new information is going to

19

fall on the manufacturer because it is asserting a

20

pre-emption defense, but the way pre-emption gets argued

21

in the courts, it is done oftentimes before discovery is

22

permitted.

23

manufacturer's files that would be relevant to a

24

determination of the breach of duty by the drug

25

manufacturer, if you decide pre-emption has to be done

One is that the

So, if there is information in the drug

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

before discovery can be done, there would be no way to

2

get that information.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, to put the burden on

4

the manufacturer seems to me inconsistent with what 10

5

States have said, that there is a rebuttable presumption

6

and inconsistent also with the instructions the jury

7

received in this case, that you can consider the FDA

8

label.

9

borne out by what happened in this case or by those

10

So, I think, to me, what you say there is not

other States' -

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, let me -- let me

12

address that question because your question goes to the

13

regulatory compliance defense and that is not a

14

pre-emption defense.

15

that the manufacturer in fact was not negligent because

16

it complied with the applicable regulations.

17

under that scenario, Justice Kennedy, the plaintiff is

18

going to be able to obtain discovery and make arguments

19

to the trial court about whether or not that compliance

20

negated or did not negate negligence.

21

is a Federal defense that would be asserted typically at

22

the outset of the lawsuit before information is

obtained.

Now, in fact, 30 years later, I guess,

15

without the horrible things happening that Justice

Scalia mentioned, or maybe they did -- I don't know.

7

The plaintiff

Wyeth knew about this risk for

That is what is so wrong.

That is why he

stood up and said the FDA doesn't decide this question.

9

You decide this question.

And there was never, ever a

10

suggestion in the record in this case, nor could there

11

have been, that Wyeth ever failed to bring every single

12

adverse-event report to the FDA's attention, every

13

analysis that it did to the FDA's attention.

14

And what the record does show is that after

15

16

application and the 1998 rejection of the SDNA, the

17

Supplemental New -- SNDA, the Supplemental New Drug

And, in fact, Mr. Frederick

Well, you know, in this case there could have

been stronger warnings, and that -- and this case wasn't

2

really about -- the jury wasn't really asked to -- it

3

didn't really say that the label had to contra indicate

4

something that the FDA-labeling required.

5

That is exactly the opposite of what the

6

trial lawyer told the jury at opening and at closing.

7

What he said is this was unreasonably unsafe because it

8

didn't say:

Do not use by intravenous administration.

9

With respect to whether or not the warning

10

-- the last SNDA which we submitted, which was in 1987

11

an original, but there is a typewritten version that
