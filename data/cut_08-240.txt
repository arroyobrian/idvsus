ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

8

ON BEHALF OF SHELL OIL PRODUCTS

9

COMPANY, LLC, ET AL.

10
11

MR. LAMKEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

Congress enacted the PMPA to regulate two

13

specific, but important, actions:

14

termination of the franchise prior to the conclusion of

15

the franchise term and the franchisors’ non-renewal of

16

the franchise relationship at the end of the agreement's

17

term.

18

Franchisors'

The statute responded to complaints about

19

franchisors exercising broad contractual rights to

20

terminate the franchise relationship that was not

21

addressed by -- for trivial violations or at will, that

22

was not previously addressed by State law.

23

left all other aspects of the franchise relationship to

24

State law.

25

But Congress

Because the term "terminate," at the very
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

least, requires an end, we and the United States agree

2

that the First Circuit erred in upholding a so-called

3

constructive termination, where the dealers continued to

4

receive each element of the statutory franchise -- that

5

is the premises, the trademark, and fuel --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Lamken, am I wrong that

7

you don't really object to the recognition of

8

“constructive termination,” if that phrase is used the

9

way it is used elsewhere in contract law?

10

MR. LAMKEN:

We don't believe that in contract

11

law constructive termination exists or in the analogous

12

State franchise statutes that existed at the time that

13

the Congress enacted the PMPA.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Gee, I thought -- I thought

15

that if you had a lease and the landlord fails to

16

provide heat, that you can move out and he will be

17

deemed to have constructively evicted you.

18

MR. LAMKEN:

That's right.

The term

19

"constructive eviction" we would -- we believe does

20

exist, along with "constructive discharge."

21

precise terms that Congress used here were "terminate,"

22

"non-renew," and "cancel," which are drawn from the law

23

of contracts and the U.C.C., in particular, and from

24

State franchise statutes.

25

But the

We --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that -- on that point,
5

1

the government differs with you.

2

as Justice Scalia suggested, there can be such a thing

3

as constructive termination, and you must terminate.

4

MR. LAMKEN:

Yes.

The government says,

It's not so much that we

5

differ; it's that our fallback position is the same as

6

the government's, but they do not endorse our primary

7

position, which is that there is no such thing as

8

constructive termination.

9

We believe it would be a mistake to recognize

10

constructive termination in this context for three

11

reasons:

12

that, in the most analogous context that existed at the

13

time Congress acted, State franchise statutes that used

14

terms like "terminate," "non-renew," "cancel," the terms

15

that Congress used, there was -- the notion of

16

constructive termination was frankly unheard of.

17

The first is the one I already mentioned, is

Even today, under those statutes it is not a

18

well-accepted concept, having been rejected by

19

approximately half the States to have considered it.

MR. LAMKEN:

On the contrary, Your Honor.

2

It's not so much -- there isn't a mitigation of damages,

3

any more than an employee claiming constructive

4

discharge, for example, would be mitigating damages by

5

staying in her job.

6

constructive claims are recognized, is that an employee

7

claiming --

The settled rule, even when

Well, but there --

10

move out, must quit the job, and the tenant claiming

11

constructive eviction must leave the job.

nature, even where constructive discharge and

13

constructive termination -- constructive eviction

14

claims, are recognized.

15

That is the

That is the settled rule.

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you

have confused breach with termination.

13

14

the agreement would be a breach of contract.

15

termination in contract law has long been understood to

16

be something entirely different, which is the absolute

17

refusal to provide the elements such that it's obvious

18

to any observer that there is -- these elements will not

19

be resumed.

The failure to

Corbin on Contracts, for example, describes

21

parties to the agreement."

In our view it has to be

the franchisor that terminates, not the franchisee.

17

at the very least, termination requires an end to one of

I'm talking about writing the contract.

MR. LAMKEN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -Do you really think that

that's how those contracts should be interpreted?

6

MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, sometimes they are,

7

for very good reasons, written as independent contracts

8

and sometimes they will be dependent contracts,

9

depending on the nature of the relationship between the

10
11

parties.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what is -- what is the

12

difference between your understanding of an implicit

13

termination, which is what I take it you have just been

14

describing, and a constructive termination?

15

MR. LAMKEN:

I think an implicit termination

16

is one that’s objectively viewed as ending the nature of

17

the relationship of the parties.

You may not use our trademark, or you may no longer use

The contract's over.

Fuel will not be coming.

A constructive termination, as I understand

22

the concept, could be something -- and this is the

23

difficulty with the concept -- something like charging

24

too much, an excessive price, which is a breach of

25

contract, which would prevent a reasonable franchisee
16
Alderson Reporting Company

from continuing to accept that element.

10

remediable under State law.

moment you move this into the issue of price, suddenly

12

the issue of price -- how much the franchisor can charge

talks about termination and non-renewal.

MR. LAMKEN:

But I don't think -- in the

6

highly unusual case of $1,000 per gallon or things like

7

that, that might be the case.

8

you see a 1 percent increase in gas prices in highly

9

volatile petroleum markets.

But in the ordinary cases

For example, in this case,

10

where Shell raised its prices considerably but was still

11

charging less than Exxon and Chevron, as the joint

12

appendix 225 and 237 made clear, that's what you end up

13

with as claims for constructive termination, if you

14

recognize constructive termination.

15

But Congress was worried about actual

16

terminations, the exercise of contractual rights, broad

17

contractual rights, to terminate that were formerly not

18

regulated, not breaches of contract that were already

19

regulated by -- comprehensively, by State law.

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. O'NEIL:

Was it a reasonable rate?
The question is whether it

15

would be so intolerable -- not whether the rate is fair,

16

but whether it would be so intolerable that a reasonable

17

franchisee, a rational franchisee who is economically

18

motivated, would have any alternative but to abandon it.

19

And if the franchisee could continue in business, then

20

it is not a constructive termination.

21

might have a claim for breach of contract, but as long

as -- as long as it would not be a fitting response to

actually abandon the premises, then that is not a

9

MR. O'NEIL:

Well, Justice Scalia, the whole

10

point of the PMPA was that State law remedies were

11

inadequate in that narrow context where the franchisee's

12

very existence was threatened.

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"In the context of

termination" is what the statute says.

15

MR. O'NEIL:

Yes, and under well-established

16

background principles of the law that Congress was

17

drawing on when it enacted the PMPA, termination was not

18

limited solely to explicit termination.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what are these -What background principles

were they?

22

There was constructive discharge and constructive

essence one of landlord and tenant.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

And so it was

natural for Congress to draw on that body of law, as

well as the body of law governing the termination of

other kinds of relationships like employment, for the

4

meaning of the -- of "termination" under the PMPA.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. O'Neil, I thought that

6

there were some cases, landlord-tenant cases, where the

7

tenant is not required to leave the premises because, as

8

awful as the situation is, the tenant has no place to

9

go.

10

MR. O'NEIL:

Justice Ginsburg, I am not aware

11

of those cases, and I think the general rule is the one

12

that -- that is -- is broadly stated in the cases, which

13

is that if the franchisee -- excuse me, if the tenant

14

wants to claim constructive eviction, they need to leave

15

the premises.

16

that in order to claim constructive eviction, you

17

actually have to leave.

18

That is a bedrock principle of the law,

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what happens -- in other

19

words, suppose the landlord here really wants the guy to

20

clear out, so he puts thumbtacks on the ground and

21

horrible-smelling things all over.

didn't want you to leave; that's your problem.

MR. FARRAHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

In this case, the jury determined that Shell

25

the PMPA when they raised rent to force dealers out of
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

business and convert their stations to direct

operations.

3

conduct designed to force the dealers out of business is

insufficient to invoke statutory protection because the

dealers were not deprived of any of the statutory

elements of the franchise, and they remained in business

7

for some period following the rental increase.

So what's the test?
Pardon me, Your Honor.
What's the test?

Because if

13

you say we are going to give an action to a person who

14

didn't clear out, although the franchisor was trying to

15

get him to clear out, you are then going to convert into

16

a Federal action every single breach of contract or

17

serious breach of contract that there is, which is the

18

precise opposite of what Congress wanted when it passed

19

this statute.

20

So, what is your test as to we know that your

21

case is the lions and tigers case?

22

MR. FARRAHER:

Justice Breyer, I believe that

23

you hit on two points:

First off, what is the test

24

sufficient to invoke a constructive termination?

25

then, secondly, a point that the panel has addressed is
32
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

whether or not abandonment of the franchise is required

by the statute.

I wouldn't put it that way.

terminate.

means you didn't do it.

the business.

off, with respect to whether the conduct is sufficient

to force a termination, we believe the First Circuit's

19

standard of materiality, which is effective to end one

20

of the components of the statutorily defined franchise,

21

is sufficient.

22

With respect to the second part of your

23

question, which is why didn't these dealers leave the

24

station, and --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

I want to know your test

for deciding -- even though the first part is met, how

8

as if you told him to leave.

I've got that part.

doesn't leave?

That's that second part that's bothering me.
MR. FARRAHER:

And Your Honor, I'm not sure

14

there’s a test for that, but certainly the statute

15

doesn't contemplate that the dealer would have to leave.

16

For example, the injunctive remedy in the statute would

17

allow a dealer to come in --

remedies in the State court?

20

MR. FARRAHER:

22

reason I need a test is because the other side is

so bad that a reasonable person would have left, then

5

elements, what the judge asked the jury to determine

15

continues?

16

MR. FARRAHER:

What does it mean to

Yes, Your Honor, Justice Alito.

contracts, and a franchise relationship.

dealers, regardless of the fact that there was some

relationship that continued with the parties afterwards?

more specific than to say the lease is effectively

ended?

that they can -- they can -- and -- and put such

intolerable conduct at issue, for example, raising the

rent by several hundred percent, and that doesn't

But in this case here what Shell's position is

They argue that they must affirmatively

That's right, Your Honor.

and we have to, again, go back to the statute to

recognize what the word "termination" means in the

20

context of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act.

21

Certainly, Shell envisions that it means that there must

22

be an end to the relationship.

Our position is that the injunction is a form

to trial within a very short period of time.

2

And, number two, even though there is a

3

relaxed standard for injunctive relief, it was not clear

4

that the dealers would be able to sufficiently meet

5

their burden of proof to demonstrate to the court that

6

an injunction should be issued.

7

Again, we are dealing here in a practical

effect of asking an oil company on a national basis to

The damages awarded were

precisely the same, and the judge instructed the jury

standard and the lack of a need to show irreparable harm

don't leave, I guess you have the option to stay in

8

business or to leave at any time.

9

MR. FARRAHER:

They certainly do, Your Honor.

10

And -- and what happened here, obviously, is that the

11

oil company imposed such onerous conditions that they

12

expected dealers would leave.

13

Massachusetts within the time period of the

14

20

you too much money under the contract and you are really

21

hurting doing -- putting lions and tigers, whatever they

22

are doing, go get an injunction in State court.

23

They have injunctions in State courts.

So, here's your choice, dealer:

7

9

So,

Why is that a bad choice?

MR. FARRAHER:

It's -- it's a bad choice, Your

Honor, because it puts the dealer in a position of

having to determine whether they should abandon their

11

lives’ works in order to benefit from a -- from a

oil company's view, we don't get to make that choice,

MR. FARRAHER:

Your Honor, I think in the --

with -- again, with the injunctive relief available, a

court could in the initial stages without the aid of

5

obligations are during the course of the litigation.

6

Here the dealers continued to pay the exorbitant rents

7

that were being charged.

8

9

claim and then the proceedings that ensued.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I would argue that the oil

Well, I don't know.

They --

11

you know, if they knew that they were pulling out and --

12

and were claiming a termination, they might have been

13

looking for somebody else to take over the franchise.

14

MR. FARRAHER:

Well, Your Honor, I think, as a

15

practical matter, that would not have happened during

16

the pendency of the litigation.

17

extent that the -- an injunction had been sought, it

18

would have helped to preserve the status quo, and in

19

this case, again, here, the oil company was not in any

20

way, shape, or form harmed by the dealers' pursuit of

21

their claim because they continued to pay their rent,

22

for those that remained in business, and those that went

23

out of business obviously stopped.

24
25

So, again, to the

Your Honors, if I may turn to the other claim,

1

the non-renewal, both the government and Shell have

2

suggested that the statute imposes some sort of a

3

mandatory mechanism requiring the franchisor to give

4

notice and then the dealer seeking an injunction within

5

90 days in order -- in connection with the non-renewal

6

claim.

7

I think, as a practical matter, we need to

8

start with the proposition of what the jury found here,

9

and the jury found that, in this case, the oil company

10

added new terms to the lease specifically for the

11

purposes of converting the franchise-operated stations

12

to direct operations.

13

business, and they wanted to take over operations of

14

their stations.

15

They wanted the dealers out of

Had the oil company issued a notice of

16

non-renewal when the parties didn't reach agreement on

17

the terms of the agreement and this case had proceeded

18

to a trial, there is no question, but that the result

19

would have been exactly the same as the result is here.

20

So the question we are facing is whether or

21

not this mechanism that they have advanced as being

22

the -- the only way, the exclusive remedy to proceed is,

23

in fact, such, and we would argue that, in fact, it is

24

not.

25

conceded already that, while the statute requires notice

Both the government and the Solicitor have

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in the normal course, that, certainly, notice can be

2

side-stepped, and that conduct can give rise to notice.

3

The next question then would be whether or not

4

the dealer must seek injunctive relief as a prerequisite

5

to maintaining a claim, and we argue that there is

6

nothing in the language of the statute suggesting that

7

the injunction is mandatory.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

The theory of it is to

protect the dealer, and the dealer here is faced with a

10

company that says, we are not going to renew your lease.

11

And they are unreasonable, and the dealers think.

12

statute says:

13

we’ll give you a really good deal, so you won't be hurt.

14

If you really think he's wrong, go sue for an

15

injunction. And, second, we are going to give you extra

16

bonus damages and attorneys' fees and all that stuff.

17

So we protected you a lot.

18

Fine, don't renew it, okay?

Congress provides for injunctive relief, which would be

applicable equally to non-renewal claims as it would to

5

notice, again, applicable to both, there is absolutely

6

nothing in the statutory language that says this is a

7

mandatory exhaustion of remedies.

8

You must seek an injunction --

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but there is a purpose,

MR. FARRAHER:

The Seventh Circuit, if I

2

understand the case correctly, Your Honor, says that

3

there’s no implied cause of action under 2805(f)

4

standing alone, that if a franchisor is insisting upon a

5

term that includes a waiver, as in connection with

6

non-renewal, then the Dersch decision in the Seventh

7

Circuit would say that that might be actionable under

8

2802(b)(3) because they have introduced a term that is

9

not agreed upon and is designed for the purposes of

10
11

forcing the dealers out of business.
I don't know that we have taken an opinion,

12

whether or not there’s an independent or implied cause

13

of action standing alone under 2805(f).

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I would have thought

15

your strongest argument would have been that, if we have

16

a statutory right not to waive any of our Federal or

17

State rights, if there has been a non-renewal on

18

reasonable terms, there has been a breach of that

19

obligation under the statute, then you had a right to be

20

renewed under reasonable terms, and if they are giving

21

you unreasonable terms -- "unreasonable" being defined

22

within the statutory constraints -- they impose

23

conditions that were imposed in bad faith to drive you

24

out; those are the two conditions -- then you had a

25

right to sue for that, non-renewal, because you had a

right to renew on reasonable terms.

7

MR. FARRAHER:

Your Honor, I -- I guess the --

8

the best response I have to that proposition is that we

9

are not dealing in a traditional landlord/tenant context

10

here.

We are dealing under a statutory scheme that

11

Congress enacted to protect franchisees, and we need to

12

look within the meaning of the statute as to what

13

termination means.

14

I would also say that, in the landlord/tenant

15

context, while the, perhaps, outdated notion of a

16

constructive eviction would require the tenant to leave,

17

cases seem to suggest, in a more modern sense, that the

18

relationship between the landlord and the tenant is more

19

of a contractual relationship in nature and, as such,

20

allows for the traditional remedies available under

21

contract law, in turning -- including self-help and

rescission, et cetera.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

3

ON BEHALF OF SHELL OIL PRODUCTS

4

COMPANY, LLC, ET AL.

5

MR. LAMKEN:

Thank you.

6

I believe the debate in this case comes down

7

to about three issues:

The first is what is the

8

relevant background principle we think Congress was

9

looking to when it used the words “terminate,”

10

“non-renew,” and “cancel” in the statute.

11

most analogous background principles they would have

12

been looking to were contract law and the State

13

franchise statutes that existed at the time Congress

14

acted.

15

We think the

I -JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, Mr. Lamken, isn't it

16

true that the statute, as a whole, expressed Congress's

17

feeling that the common law rules were really not

18

sufficient because, under the common law, of course,

19

they could just non-renew because they wanted to take

20

over the franchise themselves.

21

that is not permissible.

22

that's created by the statute, which suggests, to me,

23

that maybe they didn't want to adopt all the preexisting

24

common law.

25

MR. LAMKEN:

And under the statute,

So there’s a major change

Right.

There was a deficiency in

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the common law, but it was limited to one point, and

2

that was termination and non-renewal.

3

breaches of contract -- and as the government has

4

explained, a breach of contract here is a precondition

5

to a constructive termination claim -- were

6

insufficiently remedied by State law.

7

issue before Congress.

8
9

It wasn't that

That was not the

The issue before Congress was that there was a
contractual right to terminate at will or for trivial

10

reasons or to non-renew for no reason or bad reasons

11

even, and that is what Congress regulated, was

12

terminations and non-renewals, in that sense, not

13

breaches of contract that turned out to be really bad.

14

The second thing is that because there was a

15

comprehensive State remedy, there is particularly little

16

reason to read this statute, this narrow statute,

17

expansively, particularly given that this is an

18

expressly preemptive -- a potentially conflict

19

preemption statute, which could have the effect of

20

displacing State law.

21

When you're looking at a statute that’s

22

narrowly looking at termination or non-renewal, you

23

would not ordinarily expand those terms to include

24

really bad breaches of contract, because that has the

25

potential to displace State statutory and potentially
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

State common law under the preemption clause.

2

And, finally, the last piece that comes up is

3

the problem of evasion.

The issue becomes sort of,

4

well, people can just get around this statute if there

5

is no constructive termination cause of action.

6

answer to that is:

7

because everything that’s covered by constructive

8

termination has to be a breach of contract.

9

has this comprehensively covered.

And the
