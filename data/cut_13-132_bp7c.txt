 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

first this morning in Case 13132, Riley v. California. 

5

 Mr. Fisher? 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

7

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

8

 MR. FISHER: 

9

please the Court: 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 This case involves applying the core 

11

protection of the Fourth Amendment to a new factual 

12

circumstance.  It has always been the case that an 

13

occasion of an arrest did not give the police officers 

14

authority to search through the private papers and the 

15

drawers and bureaus and cabinets of somebody's house, 

16

and that protection should not evaporate more than 200 

17

years after the founding because we have the 

18

technological development of smartphones that have 

19

resulted in people carrying that information in their 

20

pockets. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Just  just to test the 

22

principle for why the police can search and seize 

23

some  some objects.  Consider a gun.  The arrestee has 

24

a gun on his person and the police take the gun.  Is 

25

part of the reason for that seizure to obtain evidence

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the crime or is it just for the safety of the officer 

2

and the safety of the community? 

3

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, what this Court said in 

4

Robinson at Page 235 is the reason supporting the 

5

authority for a search incident to arrest are the two 

6

Chimel factors, which are gathering evidence to prevent 

7

its destruction, and officer's safety.  Now 

8
9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What about gathering 

evidence in order to make the case?  For instance, with 

10

the gun, could they take fingerprints?  The  the gun 

11

is in the police station where the arrestee is being 

12

booked.  A, could they take fingerprints?  B, could they 

13

copy the serial number?  C, could they see how many 

14

shells were left in the chamber?  They obviously have to 

15

empty it for safety purposes.  All for the purpose of 

16

building the case, of  of obtaining evidence? 

17

 MR. FISHER: 

Yes, of course that's done 

18

every day.  Once the gun is in the police  the police 

19

department's lawful possession, I think Edwards says 

20

that they can do all that. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So  so if  if the 

22

proposition then, if the principle then is that some 

23

objects that are obtained from the arrestee can be 

24

examined in order to build the State's case, is that at 

25

least a beginning premise that we can accept in your

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case, although, obviously, there are problems of the 

2

extent and intrusiveness of the search that are  are 

3

in your case, but not in the gun hypothetical. 

4

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, the 

5

Court has never described that as one of the things.  If 

6

you want to think about this case the way you thought 

7

about the automobile search in Gant, it would be a 

8

beginning premise; but I think you're right, that even 

9

if that were a beginning premise, it would be only that, 

10

a beginning.  In Footnote 9 in Edwards, this Court said 

11

that any search incident to arrest still has to satisfy 

12

the Fourth Amendment's general  general 

13

reasonableness. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I think you're right that 

15

Gant is probably the best statement in support of the 

16

principle that I've  I've suggested, and then you 

17

might say, well, that's limited to automobiles 

18

 MR. FISHER: 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

20

where we started. 

21

 MR. FISHER: 

Right. 
 and then we're back 

Right.  And there's important 

22

things to understand if you want to start thinking about 

23

Gant, because both in terms of its history and its 

24

modern application, it's dramatically different from 

25

what we have here.

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, Mr. Fisher, before we 

2

do that, have you been accurate in what you said about 

3

Robinson and about the Court's cases?  In Weeks, which 

4

was quoted in Robinson, the Court said:  "The right, 

5

always recognized under English and American law, to 

6

search the person of the accused when legally arrested 

7

to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime." 

8

Is that historically inaccurate?  Do you want us to 

9

repudiate that? 

10

 MR. FISHER: 

No, Your Honor.  What Weeks 

11

said, you quoted it, fruits and instrumentalities of the 

12

crime have always been something that could be seized 

13

from a person.  Now, Weeks, of course, as this Court 

14

said in Robinson itself, was dicta.  And there was that 

15

historical authority to take fruits and evidence  I'm 

16

sorry  fruits and instrumentalities of the crime. 

17
18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Did it say 

instrumentalities or evidence?  Which did it say? 

19

 MR. FISHER: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Weeks used 
Because Justice Alito said 

21

evidence.  You  you changed it to instrumentality.  Is 

22

one of you wrong? 

23

 MR. FISHER: 

Weeks uses the word "evidence," 

24

but, Justice Scalia, because it was not at issue in that 

25

case, the  the Bishop treatise that you cited in your

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Thornton concurrence talks about tools and 

2

instrumentalities. 

3

 Now, I don't think we have to debate that 

4

here, because even if we're in a world where the police 

5

can seize some evidence and keep it and use it for the 

6

prosecution simply for that reason, even if they don't 

7

fear destruction, there are still very, very profound 

8

problems with searching a smartphone without a warrant, 

9

because even under the Robinson rule, this Court has 

10

recognized, for example, when it comes to blood draws, 

11

search  something like a strip search that might occur 

12

at the scene, there are limits even to the Robinson 

13

rule.  So it brings us 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, smartphones 

15

smartphones do present difficult problems.  But let me 

16

ask you this:  Suppose your client were an oldschool 

17

guy and he didn't have  he didn't have a cell phone. 

18

He had a billfold and he had photos that were important 

19

to him in the billfold.  He had that at the time of 

20

arrest.  Do you dispute the proposition that the police 

21

could examine the photos in his billfold and use those 

22

as evidence against him? 

23

 MR. FISHER: 

No.  That's the rule of 

24

Robinson, that any physical item on an arrestee can be 

25

seized and inspected and then used as evidence if it's

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

useful evidence.  We draw a line.  
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes.  What is the difference 

3

between looking at hardcopy photos in a billfold and 

4

looking at photos that are saved in the memory of a cell 

5

phone? 

6

 MR. FISHER: 

The difference is digital 

7

information versus physical items.  Physical items at 

8

the scene can pose a safety threat and have destruction 

9

possibilities that aren't present with digital evidence. 

10

What is more, once you get into the digital world, you 

11

have the framers' concern of general warrants and the 

12

the writs of assistance. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, how does that apply 

14

how does that apply to these hardcopy photos in the 

15

billfold?  They don't present a threat to anybody.  And 

16

I don't see that there's much of a difference between 

17

the government argues there's a greater risk of the 

18

destruction of digital evidence in a cell phone than 

19

than there is in the photos.  So I don't quite 

20

understand how  how that applies to that situation. 

21

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, let me take those one 

22

thing at a time.  I take it the theory of Robinson, this 

23

is the theory the government itself propounded, is that 

24

any physical item, because it contained a razor blade or 

25

a pin or anything, needs to be inspected to be sure.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And so you have a categorical rule because of the ad hoc 

2

nature of arrests that police don't have to distinguish 

3

physical items one from the other. 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but the  but in 

5

the wallet  we'll just stick with Justice Alito's 

6

hypothetical  they find a business card or something 

7

which shows a car rental service.  Can they turn the 

8

card over and read it?  They're not looking for a pin or 

9

an explosive.  They're trying to read what's on the 

10
11

card.  Can they do that? 
 MR. FISHER: 

I think they can, if nothing 

12

else, under plain view once it's in their hand, Justice 

13

Kennedy.  But I really don't want to fight 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, they turn  they turn 

the card over. 
 MR. FISHER: 

I think that is fine under the 

17

categorical rule.  I think what you have in Robinson is 

18

a categorical rule that obviates these exact difficult 

19

casebycase determinations.  You can make an argument, 

20

and if I needed to, if it were a diary case or a 

21

billfold case, you might be able to make an argument, 

22

but I think the Court wisely decided under Robinson that 

23

we need a categorical rule that's easily administrable 

24

in the field. 

25

 Now, when you have digital evidence, the

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

categorical rule, we submit, cuts exactly in the 

2

opposite direction.  Because digital information  even 

3

the notion of flipping through photos in a smartphone 

4

implicates vast amounts of information, not just the 

5

photos themselves, but the GPS locational data that's 

6

linked in with it, all kinds of other information that 

7

is intrinsically intertwined in smartphones. 

8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Including 

information that is specifically designed to be made 

10

public.  I mean, what about something like Facebook or a 

11

Twitter account?  There's no real  there's no  any 

12

privacy interest in a Facebook account is at least 

13

diminished because the point is you want these things to 

14

be public and seen widely. 

15

 MR. FISHER: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, Mr. Chief Justice 
So I guess my 

17

question would be:  Could you have a rule that the 

18

police are entitled to search those apps that, in fact, 

19

don't have an air of privacy about them? 

20

 MR. FISHER: 

I think that would be 

21

extraordinarily difficult to administer that rule.  And 

22

let me tell you why.  Because most of the information on 

23

smartphones is private.  Much of it is just, like the 

24

photos in this case, just kept on somebody's phone and 

25

not shared with anybody.  Even a Facebook account is a

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

limited universe of people who have access to it. 

2

You're right that 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

More  more or less 

4

limited.  I mean, you know, maybe it's 20 people; maybe 

5

it's a hundred people.  But it's certainly not private 

6

in the sense that many of the other applications are. 

7

 MR. FISHER: 

I think it's fair to say you 

8

have a sliding scale and there's some stuff on a phone 

9

that might be posted on the Internet, for example.  The 

10

difficulty with that case, if you wanted to address it 

11

in a future case, would be the intertwined nature of 

12

information on a phone.  So looking at those photos in a 

13

smartphone account will be linked to the contacts inside 

14

the phone; it will be linked to GPS information inside 

15

the phone.  All of this information is intertwined and I 

16

think you'd have a difficult administrability problem if 

17

you wanted to create some sort of rule like that. 

18

 Now, remember, the government might try to 

19

deal with that problem differently by saying information 

20

in the cloud, so to speak, is not accessible to 

21

officers.  We submit that just further would compound 

22

the difficulty of applying a rule in this circumstance. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But do you think in this 

24

case we have to decide whether all the information that 

25

may be available in a smartphone can be examined by the

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

police when the owner of the phone is arrested or can we 

2

just focus on the particular evidence that was admitted 

3

in your client's trial? 

4

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, the way you've phrased 

5

the question, I think that's what  that's the first 

6

cut at this, is looking at the particular pieces of 

7

evidence here, which are photos and videos.  But we 

8

don't think you can write an opinion that would 

9

distinguish those from anything else on a  almost 

10

anything else on a smartphone.  I mean, the State's 

11

argument here is that those are not, quote, 

12

"fundamentally different" from other things that people 

13

would carry around. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you think you could 

15

have obtained a warrant  or that the police could have 

16

obtained a warrant in this case? 

17
18

 MR. FISHER: 

In all likelihood, yes, Justice 

Kennedy. 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

20

 MR. FISHER: 

21
22

All right. 
And they had plenty of time to do 

so. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, then the evidence 

23

that's seizable under the warrant is  is reasonable, 

24

and Justice Alito points out the fact that some of this 

25

evidence is  is reasonable.  If there's a  there's a

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

limitation with reference to the way the police behaved, 

2

as Justice Alito points out, it's limited just to this 

3

evidence. 

4

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, let me say a couple 

5

important things about the warrant requirement and then 

6

return to Justice Alito's question.  This Court has said 

7

time and again that the mere fact the police could have 

8

gotten a warrant but didn't does not excuse a Fourth 

9

Amendment violation.  Let me say a couple things about 

10

the warrant requirement and then return to Justice 

11

Alito. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but it  it just 

13

goes to the fact that this  that this is searchable 

14

under Fourth Amendment standards. 

15

 MR. FISHER: 

With a warrant, Justice 

16

Kennedy.  And let me talk about why a warrant is so 

17

important.  First of all, it interposes a neutral 

18

observer in between the citizen and the police officer. 

19

Perhaps more importantly, it does two very big things. 

20

One is it can trigger the Fourth Amendment's 

21

particularity requirement so that the magistrate can 

22

say:  This is what you can look at and what didn't. 

23

Remember, in this case the prosecution ultimately 

24

introduced photos and videos, but that's not what the 

25

detective testified to at trial as to the scope of his

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

search.  He said, at JA11, we looked at a whole lot of 

2

stuff on the phone and that's just what, in his words, 

3

"caught his eye." 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So how  how would it 

5

work with a magistrate?  You recognize  you just told 

6

Justice Kennedy  that a warrant could be obtained.  A 

7

warrant for what?  What would the police have to show? 

8

And let's take your very case.  So they  they have 

9

seized, which is proper, seized the phone, they've 

10

secured it, and now they want to search it.  So they 

11

apply for a warrant.  And what would the warrant have to 

12

say? 

13

 MR. FISHER: 

We give an example of a warrant 

14

in the footnote in our reply brief.  I believe it's 

15

footnote 3, Justice Ginsburg.  And there are many more 

16

available on the web from States that already require 

17

warrants.  What they do is they say  the police 

18

officer testifies, perhaps somewhat like he testified 

19

here at the suppression hearing, I suspected this fellow 

20

was in a gang and  and I believe gang members keep 

21

certain kinds of things on their phone, this is the kind 

22

of crime that we're investigating, and therefore these 

23

particular files within the phone are likely to obtain 

24

evidence.  And then what happens is the warrants say 

25

with particularity:  Here's the things you can look at;

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here's what you can't.  More importantly, Justice 

2

Ginsburg, a warrant requirement 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I thought you say 

4

that's very  you've told us that that's  that's hard 

5

to figure out, what you can and what you can't.  But 

6

it's easy for a magistrate, but  but impossible for 

7

a  for an arresting officer? 

8
9
10

 MR. FISHER: 

I think much easier for a 

magistrate at some remove than an officer under the 
under the stresses in the field.  Now, Justice Scalia 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MR. FISCHER: 

Well, but 
 I agree, it's not going to 

13

be perfect.  And so let's look at what happens under our 

14

world 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

16

 MR. FISHER: 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If I could just 

Yes. 
 on the same lines 

18

as  as Justice Scalia.  The point you make elsewhere 

19

in your brief and argument is that the cell phone or 

20

the  the smartphone has everything. 

21

 MR. FISHER: 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right. 
It's got the 

23

person's whole life.  Well, if you're arresting somebody 

24

on the grounds of suspicion that he's a gang member and 

25

you have evidence to support that, what part of the

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

smartphone is not likely to have pertinent evidence? 

2

What application is not?  I mean, here you've got 

3

pictures, you've got videos, you've got calls.  I just 

4

 I guess it's similar to what other issues have been 

5

raised.  I don't know what a magistrate is supposed to 

6

put in the warrant. 

7
8
9

 MR. FISHER: 

I would say his banking app, 

his online dating app 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You don't think his 

10

banking app  his banking app is going to say on this 

11

day he deposited $10,000 into his account, and then 

12

that's going to coincide with a particular drug deal. 

13

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, those 

14

arguments can be made on an appbyapp basis.  But what 

15

happens is  this is the benefit of our rule as opposed 

16

to the government's.  What the government says is let 

17

the officer look and then have a backend hearing where 

18

you just suppress all the stuff that he wasn't supposed 

19

to look at once you apply particularity requirements. 

20

 Under our rule, once the officer has the 

21

warrant, Leon kicks in and so you don't have to have all 

22

these hearings in district courts, because once an 

23

officer does a proper search according to the corners of 

24

a warrant, you don't have to have the kind of 

25

suppression hearing.

16

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 And there's one other very important thing 

2

that goes into a warrant which might have been glossed 

3

over too quickly in the briefs.  It's not just what can 

4

be looked at; it's how it can be kept.  The retention of 

5

information raises extraordinary Fourth Amendment 

6

concerns.  My understanding in California is, at least 

7

for some crimes, it's not just that they're downloading 

8

the information and looking at it for the crime of 

9

arrest, but they're keeping this information in 

10

databases, evergrowing databases of every cell phone 

11

that they've ever seized. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What if you have a 

13

device that doesn't have the broad information that a 

14

smartphone has, but only a very limited, like a Fitbit 

15

that tells you how many steps you've taken, and the 

16

defendant says, I've been in my house all afternoon, and 

17

they want to check and see if he's walked 4 miles.  It's 

18

not his whole life, which is a big part of your 

19

objection.  Is that something they can look at? 

20

 MR. FISHER: 

I think probably not.  And I 

21

think this is the way the categorical rule in Robinson, 

22

where it sweeps in the kind of hypotheticals we were 

23

talking about in one direction.  I think a categorical 

24

rule in the other direction for digital information 

25

would sweep in the Fitbit.  I mean, obviously, I don't

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have to win that argument today, but I think that's how 

2

you would approach that question.

 Remember, the Fitbit  and this is true 

4

even more so of smartphones  tells you just the kind 

5

of information the Court was very concerned about in 

6

Kyllo.  It tells you  modern smartphones work the 

7

inside of people's house.  They work the appliances 

8

and  and they have cameras.  They also monitor the 

9

inside of people's bodies. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if the phone in this 

11

case was an oldfashioned flipphone?  So it had the 

12

capacity to take pictures, but a much more limited 

13

memory.  Would it  would it be a different case? 

14

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I think you may want to 

15

 that will be part of your conversation in the next 

16

case perhaps.  I think the easiest way to decide the 

17

case right now in 2014 is simply say:  Digital evidence 

18

kept on modern cell phones are different than physical 

19

items.  I don't think it's really worth going back in 

20

time to the most rudimentary device and having that 

21

argument. 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if the person had on 

his person a compact disk with photos saved on that? 
 MR. FISHER: 

I think that might be the same 

kind of case as you have now.  Remember, the  the

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

phone in this case had a removable memory card, as many 

2

still do, which by the way we were going to talk about 

3

the destruction of evidence.  That's one answer to the 

4

destruction of evidence problem.  It couldn't possibly 

5

have arisen with respect to the evidence at issue 

6

because it was on a removable memory card that couldn't 

7

be erased remotely or password protected. 

8
9
10
11

 Now, we've given lots of arguments in the 
brief that explain why the government's arguments as to 
wiping simply don't stand up.  And 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Fisher, would you 

12

an earlier question, you didn't finish the answer.  You 

13

were describing a difference between the downloading by 

14

police into databases that they keep forever.  What 

15

happens with materials that are returned pursuant to a 

16

search warrant?  Are they precluded from doing that? 

17

 MR. FISHER: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

understood your 

20

 MR. FISHER: 

No. 
I wasn't sure I 

Right.  So I take it that the 

21

ordinary rule is if the police lawfully seize evidence 

22

in the physical world, if it's a  if it's a physical 

23

item, it might at some point have to be returned to the 

24

owner of it.  But if it's something that can be made a 

25

photocopy of or a photo, it remains in police files as

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lawfully obtained information they can use indefinitely 

2

into the future. 

3

 You have real problems, however, when you 

4

apply that typical rule to digital information, because 

5

now  again, what I understand  and the government 

6

itself  the Federal Government in Footnote 3 of its 

7

reply brief in Wurie acknowledges that it's keeping in 

8

an evergrowing Federal database at least some of the 

9

information seized from smartphones.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I don't know 

that you've answered my question. 
 MR. FISHER: 

I'm sorry.  Maybe I didn't 

understand it. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Which  can they do the 

same thing once a search warrant is 
 MR. FISHER: 

Oh.  No.  Well, not 

17

necessarily, because the beauty of a search warrant is 

18

it can delineate retention rules.  It can say here's 

19

here's how long you're allowed to keep the information, 

20

here's who's allowed to look at it and who's not.  And 

21

it can 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Frankly, I have to tell 

23

you, I don't ever remember a prosecutor coming to me 

24

with that kind of delineation. 

25

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I think that, Justice

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Sotomayor, that is what is starting to now happen in the 

2

digital world, because we just have new and different 

3

concerns that had arisen  than had arisen in the past. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Fisher, would there be 

5

exigencies that would allow police to look at cell 

6

phones?  And if so, what would those exigencies be? 

7

 MR. FISHER: 

Absolutely.  There  there 

8

would be times at the scene where exigencies would allow 

9

it.  First of all, the two officer safety arguments the 

10

other side makes about a hypothetical bomb or a 

11

confederate ambush, as this Court already recognized in 

12

Chadwick, would give exigent circumstances.  The concern 

13

about remote wiping we think, and as the experts have 

14

described in the amicus brief filed by EPIC and many 

15

others, we don't think would ever arise  give rise to 

16

a situation where that was a legitimate concern, but in 

17

a very odd world, yes. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand your 

19

first exigent circumstances.  When there is a bomb, but 

20

you can't  you don't know whether there's a bomb until 

21

you look in the phone.  Whether  whether his 

22

associates are on the way to, you know, to kill the 

23

officer and  and release their confederate, you don't 

24

know until you look into the phone.  So how  you know, 

25

how can that possibly be an exigent circumstance?

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I think surrounding facts 

2

and circumstances  in Footnote 9 in Chadwick, what the 

3

Court said, dealing with a locked briefcase where you'd 

4

have the same problem, Justice Scalia, surrounding facts 

5

and circumstances might indicate. 

6

 There's a hypothetical, I believe it's on 

7

page 1 of the amicus brief filed by the State 

8

investigative agencies, that I think gives a classic 

9

textbook example of how exigent circumstances might 

10
11

apply. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It seems to me it would 

12

almost never  you would never be able to say, you 

13

know, surrounding circumstances give me reason to 

14

suspect that there's a bomb in the phone. 

15

 MR. FISHER: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17
18

No.  I 
Give me reason to suspect 

that his confederates are on the way. 
 MR. FISHER: 

I think you're right that 

19

that's going to be an extraordinarily rare circumstance. 

20

All I'm saying is if you had that extraordinarily rare 

21

circumstance, you would not need to get a warrant. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

There  there is not much 

23

authority that I could find, if the lawyer is arrested 

24

and  and they want to read his whole briefcase or you 

25

want to read a year's diary.  And you cite  I think

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's page 7 of your brief  the Learned Hand 1916 case. 

2

Is that about the best discussion you  you can find? 

3

I didn't find anything much different. 

4

 MR. FISHER: 

5

and low as well 

Justice Kennedy, we looked high 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

7

 MR. FISHER: 

Right. 
 and did not find cases 

8

involving briefcases full of documents.  And there's 

9

only one or two stray mentions of a diary.  Judge 

10
11

Friendly also mentions the diary situation. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Because it's important if 

12

we're going to try to formulate some standard which 

13

limits the extent of the search, and that's one of 

14

that's one of the problems in this case.  If  if say 

15

we rule for the government in its case, maybe it's not 

16

quite fair to ask you, but if we rule for the government 

17

in its case in Wurie, for the Federal case 

18

 MR. FISHER: 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes. 
 and there's no  it's 

20

not an exigent circumstances, is there some standard 

21

where we could draw the line which would still result in 

22

a judgment in  in your favor?  Maybe that's not quite 

23

a fair question.  You're not  you're not answering 

24

you're not arguing the  the government's case. 

25

 MR. FISHER: 

I don't want to tread on both

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lawyers in that case, but certainly in my case, we have 

2

an exploratory search where not even the State has 

3

contended the amount of information looked at is 

4

equivalent to what somebody could have carried around in 

5

the old days. 

6

 Can I say something? 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

I'm going to say 

something first. 

9

 MR. FISHER:

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

rings, can the police answer it? 

13

Okay. 

 MR. FISHER: 

If  if the phone 

There are cases on that, 

14

Mr. Chief Justice.  Obviously, this Court hasn't 

15

addressed them.  All the cases we've found are cases 

16

where the police already had a warrant in hand and 

17

they've been held that, yes, the police officers can 

18

answer the phone in that circumstance.  Unquestionably, 

19

the police officers could look at the screen. 

20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  A warrant for 

what?  A warrant for examining the phone? 

22

 MR. FISHER: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

For somebody's arrest. 
For somebody's arrest. 

24

Well, how does that extend to your ability to answer his 

25

phone?

24

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. FISHER: 

No, I'm sorry, Mr. Justice 

2

Scalia.  I think also in  to  to effectuate an 

3

arrest and  and an immediate search of the area. 

4

 Now, certainly you could look at the caller 

5

ID coming through because that would be in plain view. 

6

But if I can return to Justice Kennedy's question about 

7

the diary.  Because there's a couple of important 

8

aspects to that I hope to be able to draw out. 

9

 The reason I think that you don't find diary 

10

cases when you look for them is because people hardly 

11

ever carry a diary outside the home with them.  It was 

12

kept in a private drawer in the bedroom or wherever it 

13

might be kept, and in the highly, highly unusual 

14

circumstance where somebody did, you might have a hard 

15

case. 

16

 This is an  this is the opposite world. 

17

The modern reality of smartphones is that it is an 

18

indispensable item for everyday life of a modern 

19

professional and, indeed, most anyone.  You can't leave 

20

the house without it and be  consider yourself to be 

21

responsible and safe.  And so you take  to take a 

22

world where the police might try to say, we can get the 

23

stray diary because of the importance of the categorical 

24

rule under Robinson and try to apply that into a world 

25

where everybody has everything with them at all times 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, including the 

2

criminals who are more dangerous, more sophisticated, 

3

more  more elusive with cell phones.  That's the 

4

that's the other side of this. 

5

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, the 

6

Fourth Amendment has  has a balance already built in 

7

in that respect.  We're not saying they can't look at 

8

digital information.  We're just saying that when they 

9

seize it, they can freeze the contents and then go get a 

10

warrant and search what they're allowed to search and 

11

keep it under the rules of that warrant. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is it significant 

13

in  in this case that the information was not 

14

protected by a password? 

15
16
17
18
19

 MR. FISHER: 

No, I don't think either 

side 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That doesn't  that 

doesn't affect the expectation of privacy? 
 MR. FISHER: 

If the other side were making 

20

an argument that this wasn't even a search, then I think 

21

that might be an argument they would deploy.  But I 

22

think, and I don't want to speak for the government, but 

23

I think that they also agree that password protection 

24

doesn't matter.  And it certainly doesn't matter under 

25

their argument as to what information they get.  I mean,

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

their position is if we seize a corporate executive's 

2

smartphone at the scene that is locked and protected 

3

under password, if we can get that information out back 

4

at our lab, we get it all and we don't have to ask for a 

5

warrant and we can keep it as long as we want. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No.  I know they 

7

argue that it doesn't matter, but I'm just wondering if 

8

your position is weakened by the fact that the 

9

individual did not seek the greater protection of a 

10
11

password. 
 MR. FISHER: 

No, I don't think so.  People 

12

don't lock their homes, they don't lock their 

13

briefcases.  Simply having it inside the smartphone 

14

protected on the person is enough to trigger the Fourth 

15

Amendment, and I think to sustain the arguments I've 

16

advanced. 

17

 If I could reserve the rest of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DUMONT 

21
22
23
24
25

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 
 MR. DUMONT: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 As Mr. Fisher has said, if Mr. Riley had 
been carrying physical photographs in his pocket at the

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

time of his arrest, there's no dispute that arresting 

2

officers could have looked at those photographs to see 

3

whether they contained evidence of crime.  Now, what 

4

would have been reasonable in that situation does not 

5

become constitutionally unreasonable simply because 

6

Mr. Riley instead carried his photographs in digital 

7

form on a smartphone.  The shifted digital format does 

8

not make the photographs any less his papers or 

9

effects 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, in one of our 

11

Court decisions in the past, a series of justices 

12

asked  or noted that many of our rules were based on 

13

practical considerations.  Practically speaking, a 

14

person can only carry so much on their person.  That is 

15

different because carrying a billfold of photographs is 

16

a billfold of photographs.  It's, you know, anywhere 

17

from one to five generally and not much more.  But now 

18

we're talking about potentially thousands, because with 

19

digital cameras people take endless photos and it spans 

20

their entire life. 

21

 You don't see a difference between the two 

22

things?  What  what has now become impractical.  A GPS 

23

can follow people in a way that prior following by 

24

police officers in cars didn't permit. 

25

 MR. DUMONT: 

We certainly see a distinction,

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and we certainly see the possibility that in some cases 

2

there could potentially be a constitutional difference. 

3

What we don't see is that in this case  on the facts 

4

of this case or anything like it, like the ordinary 

5

case, there is a constitutional difference from those 

6

phenomenon.  The theory 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8

 MR. DUMONT: 

9

By the way 
The theory, even if I'm 

carrying only five photographs or if I'm carrying two 

10

letters as was the case in the Chiagles case, for 

11

instance, that Judge Cardozo decided in the '20s, they 

12

are likely to be very personal, very private 

13

photographs.  So I'm not sure that the expansion of 

14

volume increases the invasion of privacy. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dumont, on your argument 

16

and on the government's  the Solicitor General's 

17

principal argument, too, a person can be arrested for 

18

anything.  A person can be arrested for driving without 

19

a seat belt.  And the police could take that phone and 

20

could look at every single email that person has 

21

written, including work emails, including emails to 

22

family members, very intimate communications, could look 

23

at all that person's bank records, could look at all 

24

that person's medical data, could look at that person's 

25

calendar, could look at that person's GPS and find out

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

every place that person had been recently because that 

2

person was arrested for driving without a seat belt. 

3

 Now, that strikes me as a very different 

4

kind of world than the kind of world that you were 

5

describing where somebody has pictures of their family 

6

in a billfold.  Doesn't it strike you that way? 

7

 MR. DUMONT: 

I think the answer there  one can 

8

always think of marginal cases where there might be 

9

concern.  It is not the core case, it is not the 

10

typical 

11
12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I don't know why this is a 

marginal case. 

13

 MR. DUMONT: 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It is not the 
Your argument and the 

15

Solicitor General's principal argument applies to any 

16

arrest.  And it applies to everything on a cell phone. 

17

People carry their entire lives on cell phones.  That's 

18

not a marginal case.  That's the world we live in, isn't 

19

it? 

20

 MR. DUMONT: 

We hear that repeatedly.  The 

21

facts of this case are not somebody's entire life on a 

22

cell phone.  This cell phone had a handful of contacts. 

23

I don't think this is in the record, but what we understand 

24

is there were 250some odd contacts, there were about 59 

25

photos and there were perhaps 42 videos that ranged from

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

30 to 45 seconds.  Maybe a minute each. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The Court is to make a 

3

rule not for this particular case, but for this category 

4

of cases.  And I think what Justice Kagan pointed out is 

5

very nervous concern.  That is, take an offense like 

6

failing to buckle up, even driving under the influence, 

7

not gang crimes, which is what we have in this case. 

8

It's your rule, then, that the cell phone is fair game 

9

no matter what the crime, no matter how relatively 

10

unimportant the crime.  Is it all misdemeanors, all 

11

misdemeanors and that opens the world to the police. 

12

 MR. DUMONT: 

It is true that the Court 

13

typically and properly, in this area, draws categorical 

14

lines and that is what the Court said in Robinson it was 

15

doing.  Now, it also is true the Court has repeatedly 

16

said that those lines are drawn based on the generality 

17

of cases.  They are not drawn based on the marginal case 

18

where the hypothetical potential problematic  and this 

19

case is in the heartland.  It's a violent crime. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Dumont, I guess 

21

what I'm trying to suggest to you is that you call it 

22

marginal, but, in fact, most people now do carry their 

23

lives on cell phones, and that will only grow every 

24

single year as, you know, young people take over the 

25

world.

31

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I mean, that's not a 

3

marginal case.  That's what  they're computers.  They 

4

have as much computing capacity as  as laptops did 

5

five years ago.  And  and everybody under a certain 

6

age, let's say under 40, has everything on them. 

7

 MR. DUMONT: 

I think you need to look at the 

8

generality of cases.  And in the generality of cases, 

9

first of all, you will not be dealing with minor crimes. 

10

You'll be dealing with serious crimes.  And second, 

11

you'll be dealing with police who are trying to do their job 

12

by looking 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Are you saying we're just 

14

resting on the discretion of the officer?  Because if 

15

that's so, then that leads to the next question.  Well, 

16

if that's so, then we'll get a warrant. 

17

 MR. DUMONT: 

I'm saying that you're  you 

18

are trying to draw lines that can be applied by the 

19

officer in the field and often when there's not time to 

20

get a warrant either because there's a need to know the 

21

information now or because 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, let's leave  let's 

23

leave exigent circumstances out of it.  That  that's 

24

an easy case.  You're not arguing for exigent 

25

circumstances here.

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DUMONT: 

What I'd say is that  to go 

2

back to Justice Scalia's point  our argument is that 

3

the same things that Mr. Fisher concedes, the same 

4

interests that Mr. Fisher, I think, concedes justify the 

5

search of the person and the seizure of the phone, which 

6

are the exigent circumstances type arguments.  In other 

7

words, they are the need to protect officer safety and 

8

the need to preserve evidence.  And the fact is you 

9

don't know with a phone.  The officer doesn't know with 

10

a phone whether there's a safety concern or whether 

11

there's an evidentiary concern without looking at the 

12

phone. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Have there ever 

14

been  is there any basis for the generality that 

15

there's a safety concern?  Do you have a case where the 

16

 certainly not where the phone exploded, but when the 

17

phone was used to trigger a device or anything like 

18

that?

 MR. DUMONT: 

We don't have a specific case. 

What I can point you to 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do you have a 

general case? 
 MR. DUMONT: 

What I can point you to, 

24

here's a case from California.  I don't think it's cited 

25

in the briefs.  It's called Natoli.  There's one where

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there's a late night arrest.  It  it starts with a 

2

speeding ticket, and it  off the highway late at 

3

night.  It develops that, you know, maybe there's more 

4

going on and the person looks to be under the influence. 

5

Taken out of the car.  Then it looks like there might be 

6

a gun.  The officer looks at the cell phone.  The first 

7

thing he sees when he turns the phone on is a picture of 

8

what appears to be the driver standing with two assault 

9

rifles, arms akimbo like this, posing with his assault 

10

rifles.  Now, I would say that that changes the 

11

situational awareness of the officer in that situation 

12

and provides valuable information that was necessary at 

13

the time and could not have been gotten later at the 

14

station house with a warrant. 

15
16
17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What does that have 

to do with my question about a bomb? 
 MR. DUMONT: 

I'm merely saying that it has 

18

to do with safety.  So no, I can't point you to a case 

19

where they stopped Timothy McVeigh, looked at his phone 

20

and saw some notes about bomb making.  I can't give you 

21

that case. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I would assume you need 

23

to operate the phone to set off the bomb, so that once 

24

the police have the phone the bomb is not going to be 

25

set off.

 MR. DUMONT: 

That is true. But it's also true 

2

of all the objects in all the Court's prior cases.  In 

3

other words, once in Robinson the police had secured the 

4

cigarette pack, there was no question, whether there was 

5

a razor blade in it or just heroin 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7

 MR. DUMONT: 

Could I just ask you 
 that neither the evidence 

8

the evidence was not going to be destroyed and the 

9

weapon was not going to be used. 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could I ask you a 

11

question about the extent of your theory?  We're talking 

12

about smartphones, which are minicomputers.  But your 

13

theory would apply to iPads, computers, anything that's, 

14

for example, sitting next to a person in a car, at their 

15

desk if they are arrested at their desk, anywhere if 

16

they are carrying it in their hand because you see a lot 

17

of people carrying the iPad or something comparable, a 

18

tablet of some sort.  Your theory would permit a search 

19

of all of those things. 

20

 MR. DUMONT: 

Our theory extends to objects 

21

that are on the person or immediately associated with, 

22

for instance in a purse.  It doesn't necessarily extend 

23

to things that are sitting nearby.  The Court has drawn 

24

a clear line there.  It's a line, like any other line

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, how would you?

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

What is the rule?  You're saying on the person.  Suppose 

2

it's in the car in a holder or suppose it's in the 

3

passenger's seat?  Are you saying that's  you don't 

4

want to express an opinion about that?  You only want to 

5

talk about what's in somebody's pocket? 

6

 MR. DUMONT: 

I'll say I think the Court has 

7

drawn different rules for that situation.  If it's on 

8

the car seat and if the person's been removed from the 

9

car, then under Gant if there's reason to think there 

10

might be evidence of the crime of arrest on the phone 

11

they can search it and if there's not they can't. 

12

That's the rule the Court drew, but it's a different 

13

rule Under Robinson. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

15

my laptop in my backpack. 

16

 MR. DUMONT: 

Well, suppose I'm carrying 

And if your backpack is on your 

17

back when you're arrested, yes, we think that's  we 

18

think that's included. 

19

 So let me go back to this volume question, 

20

because there are two things about a cell phone that 

21

might justify some sort of a special rule.  There's the 

22

volume question and then there's the connectivity and 

23

networking question. 

24

 Now, as to the volume question, first of all 

25

we don't really have it here, but I concede that we

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

could have it in other cases.  And what they seem to be 

2

really concerned about is the idea that if you have 

3

enough information of enough different kinds on this 

4

device and the police spend enough time looking at it, 

5

they could build the kind of nearremarkable portrait 

6

that some of the Justices alluded to in Gant, or, sorry, 

7

in Jones, that  that really would be qualitatively 

8

different from what has ever been done before. 

9

 Now, there are differences from Jones. 

That 

10

was government surveillance and this is some choice the 

11

person has made to keep a certain amount of information 

12

on a phone and then to have it in his pocket.  We think 

13

there's a possibility you could get to that kind of 

14

qualitatively different search, but it is miles away 

15

from this kind of case and from the heartland case. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: Okay, so what's your rule? So there are three 

17

possibilities:  Possibility one, smartphone, no, get a 

18

warrant, unless exigent circumstances.  Possibility two, 

19

yes, it's just like a piece of paper that you find in 

20

his pocket.  Or possibility three, sometimes yes, 

21

sometimes no.  All right, which of those three is yours? 

22

 MR. DUMONT: 

Our possibility  our position 

23

is that the core information like this  that is 

24

contacts, photographs 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no, I mean of my three

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

choices.  I mean, call the first choice never except 

2

exigent without a warrant; always, you don't need a 

3

warrant; or three, somewhere in between.  Which of the 

4

three choices is yours? 

5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

 MR. DUMONT: 

It's in between with an 

explanation. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

In between.  Okay.  Now 

we're in between.  Then I get to my follow up question. 
 MR. DUMONT: 

The explanation 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

My follow up question is, 

please tell me what your inbetween rule is? 
 MR. DUMONT: 

Right.  And my inbetween rule 

13

with the explanation is that for information that is of 

14

the same sort that police have always been able to seize 

15

from the person, that includes diaries, letters, all 

16

other kinds of evidence, purely evidentiary, 

17

photographs, address books, for evidence of that same 

18

sort, the same rule should apply. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I don't understand 

that, Mr. Dumont.  Everything 
 MR. DUMONT: 

The digital format should not 

22

make a difference, and I would leave for I would leave 

23

for a different day  sorry, but the last explanation 

24

to this is I would leave for another case 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dumont 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4
5

 MR. DUMONT: 

 the question of whether the 

volume 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry.  Justice 

Kagan has a question. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dumont, I guess I just 

6

don't understand.  You said if it could be.  I mean, 

7

everything could be reduced to a piece of paper.  All 

8

your bank records, you could have them on you.  All your 

9

medical records, you could just happen to have them on 

10

you.  I mean, that would be so of absolutely everything, 

11

wouldn't it? 

12

 MR. DUMONT: 

The bank records, of course, 

13

the police can get from the bank because they're the 

14

bank's records, right, with a subpoena, not with  not 

15

with a search warrant.  So to the extent that a lot of 

16

people 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I think that the 

18

notion that you could get them legally in some other way 

19

has never justified an illegal search otherwise. 

20

 MR. DUMONT: 

No, but I think it goes to the 

21

question of how sensitive is this information that we're 

22

being told is now routinely stored on 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Your rule is sometimes.  So 

24

I say:  Sometimes; what's that?  And you say if it is 

25

the kind of thing that the police could have searched

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for if it wasn't on the computer, then they can search 

2

for it on the computer.  Now, since they can search for 

3

everything in your pockets before when it isn't the 

4

computer, then why isn't yours everything?  I mean, by 

5

the way, they don't know whether a call is or is not 

6

going to turn out to be evidence when it's in your trash 

7

box if that's, or wherever you put it, I don't know. 

8

They don't know that 'til they read it. 

9

 So I guess what you're saying is I thought 

10

it was category two, sometimes, but really it's category 

11

three, always.  Now, why am I wrong? 

12
13
14
15
16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think he inverted two and 

three, but 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That gives you time to 

think. 
 MR. DUMONT: 

If the police are looking for 

17

 have a legitimate investigative purpose, they're 

18

looking at the information on the phone to see whether 

19

there is evidence of the crime of arrest or of another 

20

crime, it seems to us that they should, at a minimum, be 

21

able to look at the same kind of information they could 

22

have looked at in any other previous context, the 

23

address book, the contacts, the phone numbers, the notes. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So but that's a 

significant concession on your part, isn't it, because

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the smartphones carry a lot of information that would 

2

not have been the sort of thing police could look at 

3

before.  GPS tracking information, the police could 

4

never have gotten that before.  So you are saying that 

5

is protected? 

6
7
8
9

 MR. DUMONT: 

I'm not saying it's protected. 

I'm saying I think it raises a different set of issues. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems to me that in 

order to try to give some answer to Justice Kagan's 

10

concerns that maybe the distinction ought to be between 

11

serious and nonserious offenses  offenses.  I don't 

12

think that exists in our jurisprudence.  Correct me if 

13

I'm wrong. 

14

 MR. DUMONT: 

I think that's correct.  The 

15

Court has previously declined to draw that line.  Now, 

16

another 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

By the way, GPS 

18

information, I don't want to admit it, but my wife might 

19

put a little note in my pocket".  Steven, remember, turn 

20

right at the third stoplight, proceed three blocks 

21

forward.  Of course you could have looked at information 

22

that showed where you had been and where you were going 

23

as long as it was on paper.  Now it's in a GPS.  So how 

24

does your rule help? 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

The GPS would see if

Official

1

he did, in fact, turn right at the thing or had gone 

2

somewhere else. 

3

 MR. DUMONT: 

I think the  again, we can 

4

conceive of situations in which the amount of 

5

information and the kind of search would lead to a 

6

qualitatively different result.  We think that it 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You could amend your answer 

8

and it's  the answers are for you, not for us.  But 

9

you could amend your answer to say not just anything 

10

that somebody could have had.  The person could have had 

11

a diary that records every place the person has ever 

12

gone in the last year, it's theoretically possible.  But 

13

you could say something that has a realistic analogue in 

14

the predigital era.  We have a similar  a problem here 

15

that's similar to the problem in the Jones GPS case. 

16

You have a rule of law that was established in the 

17

predigital era and now you have to apply it in the 

18

digital era or you're asked to apply it in the digital 

19

era where the technology changes a lot of things.  But 

20

if there is a close analogue in the digital era to 

21

something that would have been allowed in the predigital 

22

era, that may be a different story. 

23

 MR. DUMONT: 

We certainly think that's right 

24

and we think that that covers, you know, the information 

25

that was at issue here, the photographs, the short

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

videos.  It certainly covers address information, 

2

contact information, messages, text messages. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But you're not willing to 

4

limit  you're not willing to limit your position to 

5

searches that either are in order to protect the officer 

6

or in order to preserve evidence or, number three, in 

7

order to find evidence of the crime of arrest.  You're 

8

not willing to limit it that way?  You would say 

9

whatever is on the person, you can  you can search. 

10

 MR. DUMONT: 

We think of the available 

11

limits that is by far the best historically based and 

12

the most plausible one.  So to say that  and because 

13

the cases, the old cases, you pointed out that 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But that gets you into the 

15

arrest for, you know, for not wearing a seat belt, and 

16

it seems absurd that you should be able to search that 

17

person's iPhone. And you can avoid that if you  if 

18

you say, look, in the vast majority of cases, this is 

19

not going to be a problem, unless the officer can 

20

reasonably be looking for evidence of the crime of 

21

arrest.  That will cover the bad cases, but it won't 

22

cover the  you know, the seat belt arrest. 

23
24

 MR. DUMONT: 

We think that that could be a 

perfectly reasonable ruling, and there's precedent in

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Court, obviously, for that rule.  There's two things 

2

we would say about that.  First, it ought to be an 

3

objective standard in line with all of this Court's 

4

Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  It shouldn't depend on 

5

what exactly was written down on the  on the booking 

6

sheet.  It should be was there probable cause to arrest 

7

or what crimes was there probable cause to arrest for, 

8

and it also should include a plain view concept 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Or how  there's an 

10

analogue with photos.  The arrested person has photos, 

11

predigital age.  Of course you can look at them.  On 

12

the phone there are photos.  Absolutely analogous, 

13

except there are 10,000.  It's indeed his entire life 

14

history in photos. 

15

 MR. DUMONT: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right. 
On your rule, can the 

17

policeman look at the photos by analogue or not, because 

18

there are 10,000.  Okay?  What's the answer? 

19
20
21

 MR. DUMONT: 

In theory, yes, the police can 

look.  In practice 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What we have is, by the 

22

way  you understand where I'm going.  I think there 

23

are very, very few things that you cannot find in 

24

analogue to in predigital age searches.  And the 

25

problem in almost all instances is quantity and how far

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

afield you're likely to be going.  Do I accept your 

2

rule? 

3

 MR. DUMONT: 

The fundamental doctrinal 

4

basis, rational basis of the Robinson rule, I think, is 

5

that the fact that arrests  this is what Justice 

6

Powell said and Justice  well, the fact of the arrest 

7

necessarily and legitimately largely abates the privacy 

8

interest of the individual and his person and anything 

9

he or she has chosen to carry on the person. 

10

 Now, modern technology makes it possible for 

11

people to choose to carry a great deal of information. 

12

But that doesn't change the fact that the reasonable 

13

expectation, if a person is subject to custodial arrest, 

14

is that the police will search the person and look at 

15

things that they find 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dumont, is  are you 

17

saying, essentially, that nobody has any expectation of 

18

privacy, or that somebody has a dramatically reduced 

19

expectation of privacy in anything that the person 

20

actually wants to keep on them at all times?  In other 

21

words, one has to keep one's cell phone at home to have 

22

an expectation of privacy in it? 

23

 MR. DUMONT: 

No, we're not saying that at 

24

all.  But what we are saying is that people do make 

25

choices, and those choices have consequences.  And the

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consequence of carrying things on your person has always 

2

been that if you are arrested, the police will be able 

3

to examine that to see if it is evidence of crime. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

5

 Mr. Dreeben? 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN 

7

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 

8
9
10

Thank you, counsel. 

 SUPPORTING RESPONDENT 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11

 I think that it may be helpful to the Court, 

12

before exploring possible alternatives to a categorical 

13

Robinson rule, to at least briefly understand why there 

14

is a categorical Robinson rule and how cell phones 

15

implicate many of those concerns.  The categorical 

16

Robinson rule responded to the fact that when a person 

17

is carrying something on their person and they are 

18

subject to a legitimate probable cause arrest, their 

19

expectations of privacy are considerably reduced.  Not 

20

eliminated, but considerably reduced. 

21

 And the government, on the other hand, has 

22

several very compelling interests at the moment of 

23

arrest that are vindicated by conducting a thorough 

24

search of the person and the things he has.  It avoids 

25

the destruction of evidence.  It protects officer

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

safety.  And it allows the discovery of evidence that's 

2

relevant to the crime of arrest to enable prosecution. 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But, Mr. Dreeben, if 

4

the  the understanding was, when there's time, get a 

5

warrant.  So here, you can seize the phone and you can 

6

secure the phone, and you could go to a magistrate and 

7

within an hour get permission to search.  But what is 

8

the reason for cutting out the magistrate here?  It's 

9

not  the instrument itself is not going to be in any 

10

danger because the police have taken it and they've 

11

disabled it.  So I don't understand why we cut the 

12

warrant out of this picture. 

13

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So several answers to that, 

14

Justice Ginsburg.  The first is that you could probably 

15

say the same thing about almost everything that is 

16

seized under Robinson and Edwards.  Once it's in the 

17

police's hands, they can throw it in the back of the 

18

patrol car in the trunk, and it would be safe and they 

19

could go get a warrant.  But the balance has always been 

20

struck at the moment of arrest to allow the officers to 

21

fulfill the compelling interests in the matters that 

22

I've previously described. 

23

 The second, and I think very critical thing 

24

about cell phones is they do differ in the amount of 

25

information that a person can carry on them and the

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

amount of revelation about a person's life.  That is 

2

true.  They also differ in that they greatly facilitate 

3

criminal activity.  They contain a great deal of 

4

evidence, and most critically, they are subject to 

5

destruction in a way that ordinary physical items are 

6

not.  Even if an officer has a cell phone in his hand, 

7

he cannot guarantee, unless it's disconnected from the 

8

network or somehow protected from the network, that 

9

there won't be a remote wipe signal sent to the phone 

10
11
12
13

that will wipe its data. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do you have cases 

where that has happened? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

I have anecdotal reports from 

14

the F.B.I. that that has happened, that they have looked 

15

into the question of to what extent can you protect a 

16

phone through the use of things like Faraday bags.  I 

17

think one of the important things to notice, if you 

18

throw a phone into a Faraday bag, which is supposedly 

19

going to be able to block network signals, when you open 

20

it up, it has to be similarly shielded or it will pick 

21

up a signal from a cell tower, and that will wipe the 

22

phone.  And the F.B.I. tried to build a Faraday room in 

23

a building that they later discovered Verizon had put up 

24

a cell tower on it, and that cell tower put out a strong 

25

enough signal to go right through the Faraday room.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We've had a couple of 

2

States where this has been so, where they've had a rule 

3

that you can't search, for Michigan, I think, and 

4

Vermont.  And are there any instance out of those States 

5

where these scenarios have taken place? 

6
7
8

 MR. DREEBEN: 

for the experience in those States. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

take it you don't know. 

10

 MR. DREEBEN: 

11

information about that. 

12

I can't speak, Justice Breyer, 

You don't know of any.  I 

I don't have any access to the 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  So isn't this a 

13

problem that might be postponed because we have warring 

14

technologies, et cetera?  And is it  you're saying now 

15

we should allow searches of all cell phones because 

16

there might be a technology that hasn't yet in fact been 

17

used in any of the States that have this rule.  That 

18

sounds a little hypothetical.  I'm not quite sure how to 

19

handle it. 

20

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, I think that there is 

21

clearly the technology available and growing technology 

22

to wipe phones remotely.  But the other critical problem 

23

that comes back to Justice Ginsburg's point about 

24

getting a warrant is encryption technology is 

25

increasingly being deployed in cell phones.  That is

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

something that clearly is on the rise.  And when a phone 

2

is turned off or the lock kicks in and the phone 

3

encrypts, it can be almost impossible to get into it. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How about putting  let 

5

me stop you, because you were making that argument in 

6

your brief, and I have three related questions.  Okay? 

7

 Why can't you just put the phone on airplane 

8
9

mode? 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Can I answer that one first? 
Yes. 
First of all, it is not always 

12

possible to find airplane mode on all the 500, 600 

13

models of phones that are out there.  The officer has a 

14

lot of things to do when he arrests suspects.  Say he 

15

arrests five suspects in a car and they each have three 

16

cell phones.  Trying to find and put each one of them 

17

into airplane mode and then go the further step and 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You're  you're 

19

confusing me, because if you haven't searched on the 

20

scene, then the wipe is going to happen.  If you've had 

21

enough time at the precinct to put it on airplane mode, 

22

the wipe hasn't happened. 

23

 MR. DREEBEN: 

24

true, Justice Sotomayor. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that's not necessarily 

I'm a little confused

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about what this argument is.  Either you do it at the 

2

scene and you protect the phone 

3

 MR. DREEBEN: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
 or you do at the 

5

station, and you have enough time to get the warrant by 

6

putting it on airplane mode. 

7

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, you don't necessarily 

8

have enough time to get the warrant if you do it at the 

9

scene.  That  that's certainly true.  I think even 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't disagree.  Put 

it on airplane mode. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Even if you bring it back 

13

the assumption that we're going to have airplane mode 

14

and that the Court should craft a constitutional rule 

15

around airplane mode assumes that cell phones are not 

16

going to be able to be used in airplanes in the next 

17

five years and that manufacturers will continue to make 

18

an easily available button for airplane mode.  I don't 

19

think the Court should found a constitutional ruling on 

20

that assumption. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I don't disagree 

22

with you, but you're asking us for constitutional 

23

principle based on technology that might or might not do 

24

something in one or more cases, but not in the 

25

general 

51

 MR. DREEBEN: 

I think what I'm trying to 

2

suggest, Justice Sotomayor, is the traditional 

3

justifications for searchincidenttoarrest include the 

4

potential for destruction of evidence.  That is very 

5

real today.  It's Petitioner who's asking for a new 

6

rule.  We're asking for the application of the Robinson 

7

rule, and if the Court is not willing to apply the 

8

Robinson rule, then primarily, I think the best rule to 

9

apply would be the 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but that's not 

11

that's not quite accurate.  What would you do under the 

12

Robinson rule with an attorney's briefcase? 

13

 MR. DREEBEN: 

The attorney's briefcase may 

14

present particularized problems because of 

15

attorneyclient privilege. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

17

present the exact problem that every cell phone has? 

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

20

quite works for you. 

21

             

22

             

23
24

And  and doesn't that 

No.  I was referring 
So I don't think that 

 MR. DREEBEN: I  I was referring  I was referring to the 
privilege rule.  The lower courts that have looked at

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it; this Court has not.  Lower courts that have looked 

2

at the question have said that if a person is arrested 

3

holding a briefcase, the police can open the briefcase, 

4

whether locked or unlocked, and look at its contents. 

5

They can't just go through the contents for prurient 

6

interest. 

7

 They can look, however, for evidence that's 

8

relevant to criminal activity, and they do that in a way 

9

that is minimally invasive of privacy.  They're not just 

10

doing it for the sake of doing it.  They're looking for 

11

evidence. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, the tax return 

13

that's on  some  some cell phones have tax returns, 

14

so you have the tax return of the jaywalker, looking for 

15

a crime. 

16

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes, and I  and I  I would 

17

acknowledge, Justice Kennedy, that if the Court is 

18

looking for a rule that limits the ability of police to 

19

search cell phones, because cell phones are different 

20

from paper items in some respects, but not all, that the 

21

most reasonable rule to apply would be one that says 

22

when there is reason to believe that there's evidence of 

23

the crime of arrest on the phone, the officers can look 

24

for that.  When there is not, they can't.  That will 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I ask you a question

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about that, Mr. Dreeben, because given the variety of 

2

things that these cell phones have in them, it seems as 

3

though that's  you know, it sounds good as a limiting 

4

principle, but it ends up you can imagine in every case 

5

that the police could really look at everything. 

6

 So I'll give you an example. 

It's sort of 

7

like this case.  Somebody is arrested for a gun crime 

8

and now we're going to look at all the various things 

9

that might be related to a gun crime.  So whether he's 

10

bought guns, whether  you know, what  what 

11

whether he's done searches for gun stores.  His emails 

12

might something say something about gun possession or 

13

gun purchase.  He might have photographs of him with a 

14

gun.  You know, the whole range of things could relate 

15

to that crime, couldn't it? 

16

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Kagan, I would 

17

acknowledge that your reasoning is correct in certain 

18

circumstances and for certain crimes.  It would not be 

19

the case for a jaywalking crime or a bar fight or many 

20

other of the minor crimes, seat belt violations, that 

21

are posited on the other side of the equation for 

22

Respondent's or Petitioner's narrower approach to cell 

23

phone searches. 

24
25

 But I do think that a couple of things are 
worth thinking about.  First, in a serious offense like

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a firearms offense in this case, a drug offense in 

2

Wurie, if the police didn't  went, got a warrant, they 

3

would be looking at all the same things, because the 

4

only way to execute the warrant on the phone would be to 

5

engage in at least a cursory search of everything on the 

6

phone to see whether it related. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, they would be looking 

8

at the same things, but the whole idea of a warrant is 

9

that a neutral magistrate tells you that you can look at 

10

those things and has an opportunity to limit it in 

11

whatever way the neutral magistrate feels is 

12

appropriate 

13

 MR. DREEBEN: 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

15

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, I 
 and that's a protection. 
I  I'm not sure that I would 

16

go so far as to say the neutral magistrate can narrow 

17

the warrant in any way that he sees appropriate.  This 

18

Court's decisions in Grubbs and Dalia say that it's not 

19

appropriate for the magistrate to prescribe the manner 

20

of executing the search. 

21

 But I think the more fundamental point, and 

22

this is why I tried to start with the basic bedrock of 

23

Robinson, is that there is a different balance 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Go ahead, please. 

There is a different balance

55

Alderson Reporting Company

1

at the moment of the arrest.  At that moment society's 

2

interests are at their apogee in locating evidence 

3

relating to the crime of arrest and apprehending related 

4

suspects, and the suspect has a highly reduced privacy 

5

interest.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

10

 MR. FISHER: 

11

 I think I heard about four or five different 

12

proposed rules that I want to just go through, each of 

13

them, one at a time. 

14

Thank you. 

 First, the State talked about a, quote, 

15

"fundamentally different rule," and I think Justices 

16

have already figured out what we say at page 1718 of 

17

our reply brief, which is that would sweep in virtually 

18

everything on the phone. 

19

 To the extent it wouldn't, you'd have a 

20

really difficult struggle on a casebycase basis to 

21

answer the very difficult question whether any 

22

particular app had fundamentally different information 

23

that existed in the nondigital world. 

24

 I also heard a suggestion, that, well, if a 

25

laptop or a smartphone is on somebody's person, that's

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

different than if it's sitting next to them.  That's not 

2

correct if what the government says about its Chimel 

3

about passwords and wiping satisfies Chimel.  Remember, 

4

Chimel gives authority to search and seize without a 

5

warrant anything in the grab area if there's a 

6

destruction argument.  So the person who's arrested 

7

sitting at his desk at the office, in reaching area from 

8

his computer would be open to a full search under the 

9

government's rule. 

10

 There was also discussion about the 

11

exigencies at the scene of an arrest, needing to prevent 

12

a remote wipe, preventing a password from kicking in. 

13

The first thing to make sure you understand is those 

14

arguments can apply only at the scene.  They don't apply 

15

in this case, where an officer takes the phone back to 

16

the police station and 2 hours later searches through it 

17

as his  at his leisure.  So all the arguments about at 

18

the scene and what the officer needs to be able to do at 

19

the scene can be left for another case. 

20

 And I think Justice Breyer is exactly right. 

21

At the very best what the government has shown is that 

22

there may be certain tightly limited circumstances where 

23

exigent circumstances would apply. 

24
25

 And I want to say a just quick thing on the 
password question in particular, which we didn't talk

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about but may come up in the next argument.  Pages 12 to 

2

14 of our reply brief, we outline how highly unusual as 

3

a factual matter it would be for a smartphone to be 

4

seized while it's still unlocked and for an officer not 

5

to be able to address concern at the scene that it might 

6

lock later.  And it's also worth noting that in a 

7

footnote we attach, the government is arguing in lower 

8

courts that even if it does lock, that the Fifth 

9

Amendment does not give the person the opportunity to 

10

refuse to divulge the password in  in response to a 

11

warrant. 

12

 So the password argument doesn't have any 

13

play if the government wins the argument its making in 

14

the lower courts. 

15

 Justice Kennedy, you suggested the 

16

possibility of distinguishing between serious and 

17

nonserious offenses.  I think, with all due respect, 

18

this Court's decisions in Robinson and Atwater, where 

19

that issues was squarely presented, preclude that kind 

20

of a  a determination for all the reasons the 

21

government argued in those cases. 

22

 And then finally, Justice Scalia, you, I 

23

think, had mentioned a couple times the Gant principle 

24

as applied to this case, evidence that you think you 

25

might find on a phone.  Well, there's two profound

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

problems with that.  The first is, as the Court 

2

recognized in Kyllo, you need to be sure to protect the 

3

amount of privacy people had at the founding. 

4

 And as I said in my opening, the fact that 

5

somebody might incidentally have an item on his person, 

6

even in the rare case, diary or address book, are 

7

leagues away from the kind of information people have 

8

now that were stored in the home and that were 

9

sacrosanct at an arrest, and that's what the thread 

10

throughout history says is an arrest cannot be an 

11

occasion to do that kind of a search. 

12

 And, Justice Kagan, you're exactly right. 

13

If you run the Gant test through the world of crimes, 

14

the government might be able to identify a crime here or 

15

there that would be difficult to make an argument about. 

16

But lots of minor crimes, like speeding, as we point out 

17

in our brief, DUI, littering, all kinds of minor crimes, 

18

the person can make a fairly convincing argument 

19

sometimes that evidence on the phone would be relevant 

20

to that crime of arrest. 

21

 And so I think that brings me to where I 

22

want to end, which is understanding what the rule the 

23

government propounds would do in terms of just ordinary 

24

police work.  Remember, this case starts with a traffic 

25

stop for an expired license plate.  It is everyday

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

police work that traffic stops are the beginning of 

2

criminal investigations and a leverage point into 

3

searches. 

4

 If you adopt a rule that says, even a Gant 

5

rule, that says if you can make an argument that 

6

evidence on the phone would be relevant to the crime of 

7

arrest, take the suspended license, you may have an 

8

email from the DMV telling you you better come in and 

9

renew.  If that opens up every American's entire life to 

10

the police department, not just at the scene but later 

11

at the station house and downloaded into their computer 

12

forever, I think you will fundamentally have changed the 

13

nature of privacy that Americans fought for at the 

14

founding of the Republic and that we've enjoyed ever 

15

since. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

17

 The case is submitted.
