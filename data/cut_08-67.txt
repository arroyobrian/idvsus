CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument today in Yeager v. United States.

5

Mr. Buffone.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL J. BUFFONE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BUFFONE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

When a jury's acquittal resolves an issue in

11

a defendant's favor, that determination is final and the

12

government may not seek an inconsistent determination of

13

that issue from a second jury.

14

counts are not verdicts.

15

therefore a hung count cannot be inconsistent with an

16

acquittal.

17

Court's decision in Ashe v. Swenson is all that is

18

called for in this case.

19

Unlike acquittals, hung

They decide nothing, and

A straightforward application of this

A new rule is not necessary.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Buffone, may I raise

20

one preliminary issue?

And it's an issue which is -

21

does not go to the reason we took the case, but I'd like

22

your response to it.

23

Swenson argument, assumes, as you have said in the

24

brief, that the -- that the verdicts of acquittal

25

essentially determined that your client did not possess

Your argument, your Ashe v.

insider knowledge, and I question whether the verdicts

2

of acquittal did necessarily establish that fact.

3

looked at the -- at the jury instructions, and I will be

4

candid to say I did not parse the whole jury

5

instruction, so you may very well correct me in the

6

assumption that I'm going to make.

untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state

13

14

which they were made, not misleading as charged.

15

And one of them was that your client made any

It seems to me that the jury under that

16

instruction could have come back with a verdict of

17

acquittal simply on the assumption that your client had

18

not made affirmative statements at the -- at the meeting

19

in question, therefore he had no obligation to correct

20

any statements, because it is not clear from this

21

instruction that he had to correction the statements of

22

other people who omitted material facts, and that

23

therefore the only thing that the verdict proves or the

24

only thing that the verdict may have assumed is that he

25

didn't speak up and say anything.

Is that a possible analysis?

2

MR. BUFFONE:

I do not believe so, Your

3

Honor, for two reasons.

First, under the Ashe test as

4

interpreted by this Court in Dowling, the record as a

5

whole must be analyzed.

6

at admissions made by the defendant's attorney during

7

the course of the second proceeding that identification

8

of his client was not an issue.

9

at the entirety of the record, in its arguments closing

And in Dowling the Court looked

Similarly here, looking

10

and opening, and most importantly in its

11

cross-examination of Mr. Yeager, the government made

12

clear to the jury its theory of omissions.

13

theory of omission was that Mr. Yeager when he was at

14

the 2000 Analysts Conference had a duty to stand up and

15

correct omissions if there were any misstatements made

16

by others.

17

guilty of omissions if he did not affirmatively correct

18

it.

19

And that

They argued to the jury that he would be

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, no, I agree that did

20

seem to be the point of the cross-examination, and in

21

fact I guess you set it out in one of the briefs.

22

is that enough?

23

that is enough to convert or, let's say, to -- for us to

24

assume, despite a more protean jury instruction, that

25

the jury necessarily had to find a fact.

But

To my knowledge, we've never held that

5

Alderson Reporting Company

And I guess

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

maybe my question boils down to is:

Why should what

2

perhaps consumed 60 or 80 seconds of cross-examination

3

suffice to tighten up a jury instruction which -- which

4

basically is open-ended?

5

MR. BUFFONE:

Well, Your Honor, first there

6

was more to the trial record than a snippet of

7

cross-examination.

8

government began by arguing to the jury that Mr. Yeager

9

was the man behind the screen, that he was -

10

Again, in opening statement the

That's the government's -

13

it necessary for there to be a duty to disclose?

14

what would prevent -- how can we be sure that the jury

15

here did not find that there was no securities fraud

16

because, insofar as the government was proceeding on an

17

omissions theory, your client didn't have a duty to

18

disclose, did not cause a material fact to be omitted.

19

MR. BUFFONE:

And in order to

And

Your Honor, first, the

20

instructions permitted alternative ways to reach the

21

first element of securities fraud, and one of the three

22

alternatives was either misstatements or omissions.

23

I think the instruction, for all of its frailty, was

24

clear that the jury could convict on an omissions

25

theory.

Now, Your Honor's question 6

And

JUSTICE ALITO:

I agree with that, but why

2

couldn't they find that there was no securities fraud

3

based on an omissions theory because there wasn't any

4

duty on Mr. Yeager's part to disclose?

5

MR. BUFFONE:

Your Honor, the indictment was

6

an integrated theory of fraud, that it charged that Mr.

7

Yeager and others had planned to make misrepresentations

8

and material omissions for one purpose, and that purpose

was to enhance the price of Enron stock so that they

could later engage in insider trading to sell that

Hung counts are meaningless.

MR. BUFFONE:

Justice Kennedy, I agree that

19

the hung counts are meaningless and that is my point,

20

but I believe that it does further our analysis and the

21

proper analysis that this Court should engage in.

22

that is, do the acquittals have finality, and is there

23

anything inconsistent with the jury's inability to reach

24

a determination with the finality of its acquittals?

The jury did not speak unanimously in its acquittals.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that the point on which they -- you assert they were

unanimous and the point on which you say later

for any number of reasons.

15

it's quite possible that the reason that the jury failed

16
Alderson Reporting Company

If I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

understand your position, the logical analysis is not

2

going to win the case for you because, as I understand

3

the case that we've got in front of us, we have in

4

effect two lines of authority, two models, that describe

5

what the law might be in these circumstances.

6

One model, on -- on the assumption that -- that the

7

acquittals determined what you say they did, on that

8

model there -- there is -- there is an issue preclusion

9

that is raised.

10

On the second model, the model of what we do

11

in the case of a hung jury, there is no -- of course, no

12

preclusion, and there is no bar to a retrial.

13

14

Which model do we follow?

15

most important issue here, or do we say the

open-endedness and uncertainty of the hung jury, the -

the failure to reach a verdict, is the model that -

to us?

MR. BUFFONE:

And we've

The question is:

Do we say preclusion is the

How do we choose

Yes, Your Honor, I believe

22

that that is a clear choice, and the rationale for the

23

clarity of that choice is that acquittals have long been

24

recognized as being important for finality purposes for

25

double jeopardy law.

So, for example 17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Look, I know that, and -

2

and by the same token, hung juries have long been

3

recognized as raising no bar to a further trial.

4

the question is:

6

the values of the retrial possibilities?

7

choose one rather than another?

8
9

And

Why are the values in the -- the

MR. BUFFONE:

Why do I

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- the

Perez line that tells us that when there is manifest

10

necessity arising from a jury not reaching a verdict,

11

that retrial is appropriate following a hung count.

12

That line of cases stands in -- as I believe is the

13

basis of Your Honor's question, stands in sharp contrast

14

to the line of cases that require that jury acquittals

15

be given final effect, cases like Foo Fong -- Fong Foo,

16

MR. BUFFONE:

Your Honor, I think we should

go -- the Court should go to the history of its double

3

jeopardy jurisprudence, and that makes clear that the

4

core concepts underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause are:

5

First finality of jury verdicts; and, second, to avoid

6

all of the constitutional perils of successive trials,

7

because successive trials -

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I ask you this about the

finality of jury verdicts?

Is -- does the Constitution

require either Federal or State law to permit the -- a

12

MR. BUFFONE:

Your Honor, I do not believe

that -- I am not aware of a constitutional underpinning

for that, but certainly the practices in the courts are

to permit partial verdicts.

your view, require that issue preclusion occur when the

jury acquits on certain counts but hangs on other

counts?

require a different result if Federal law or State law

chooses to allow the return of a partial verdict?

that it would be a different result because I think in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Thank you, counsel.

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Two separate lines of double jeopardy

11

analysis lead to the conclusion that the government can

12

retry hung counts that occur in a verdict simultaneously

13

with acquittals.

14

government may, under the doctrine of continuing

15

jeopardy, try to obtain a verdict when a jury is hung.

16

The basic principle there is that the government is

17

entitled to one full and fair opportunity to convict and

18

that the hung counts, when the jury cannot agree,

19

interrupt and prevent the government from achieving

20

that.

21

government from completing its opportunity to obtain a

22

verdict.

23

The first is the principle that the

Double jeopardy therefore does not bar the

The second doctrinal line is that which

24

grows out of the Powell case.

Collateral estoppel is

25

premised on the idea that the jury has acted rationally.

Powell was a case in

which the Court rejected the doctrine of collateral

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's because

in the same proceeding you have two different jury

10

verdicts, one going the other way and one -- obviously,

one way and one the other way.

in the acquittal, you are undermining the jury, the only

18

determination by the jury.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

If you

Well, I don't think that it

20

undermines that determination, Mr. Chief Justice,

because the acquittals will stand as acquittals, and

they will bar reprosecution on that offense.

in the fact that in the first case where there was a

16

conflicting simultaneous verdict, one can explain the

17

acquittal on grounds of leniency or compromise or

18

something like that, that says that, therefore, we will

give effect to the -- the conviction when they're

simultaneous because of the reasons why there may be

to doubt the -- the validity of the acquittal in this

case.

MR. DREEBEN:

But there is no reason

Well, no, I think that there

is, Justice Stevens, if on the theory that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Petitioner propounds the verdict on the acquittals is

2

inconsistent with the mistrial.

in which collateral estoppel could apply, only if the

that should have led to acquittals on the insider

trading counts.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that's the only way

But if they had time.

when you have 150 counts, it's entirely possible they

MR. DREEBEN:

And

Well, I -- Petitioner's theory

11

would be identical if there were one insider trading

14

counts, because all of the insider trading counts turned

15

on a common core of fact.

When you have a case in

21

MR. DREEBEN:

We're not questioning the

Justice Souter asked as well, why the Court should

prefer the double jeopardy doctrine that allows the

government to retry the hung counts when they are all

brought together in the same proceeding?

7

this -- and I think it's made most vivid by imagining

8

Ashe v. Swenson in a slightly different posture.

9

And I think it goes to the question that

And that is

Ashe v. Swenson involved robbery of six

10

individuals at a poker game.

11

12

13

the jury's acquittal was understood to mean that the

the opportunity to try to wear the defendant down or

situation we have here -

25

In that situation I think -- which is the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the reason for that is

there are doubts about the integrity of the acquittal.

you would question the integrity of the acquittal, if

MR. DREEBEN:

There are two reasons for

3

that, Justice Breyer.

4

Jeopardy Clause is not aimed at preventing the

5

government from attempting to bring its -- all of its

6

charges in one indictment against the defendant.

7

the collateral estoppel component is aimed at is the

8

government going sequentially, carving its prosecution

9

up into pieces, and trying in different attempts.

10

The first is that the Double

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What

But -- isn't -- isn't the

11

real problem that you raised by your answer the

12

following problem:

13

as Justice Breyer's hypo suggests, lots of overlapping

14

criminal statutes -- you can indict not only for drugs

15

but for telephones, and I don't know what other

16

overlapping crimes there -- there may be.

17

that gives the government by joining a lot of

18

overlapping charges or lots of charges with common

19

elements in either one indictment through various counts

20

or simply by a series of indictments to be tried

21

together -- it gives the government a bigger chance of

22

getting a hung jury or some irrational resolution on

23

some of those issues.

Breyer's hypothetical suggested.

If they wait and bring the second count in

Therefore, isn't the policy behind

10

fact it results or can result in seriatim prosecutions?

11

What's -- what's your response to that argument?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

My response to that, Justice

13

Souter, is that double jeopardy has always consisted of

14

a balance of values.

15

that Your Honor has identified, but the countervailing

16

interest is that the government should have one full and

17

fair opportunity to convict a defendant on charges that

18

have been preferred by a grand jury on a showing of

19

probable cause, and that does not occur when the hung

20

counts deprive the government of that one opportunity.

21

There is of course the interest

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But does the -- does the

22

government ask for something more than one fair chance

23

when it comes in with 117 counts?

24

consists of a fair chance with a number of counts or a

25

number of indictments that one can reasonably expect a

Maybe the fair chance

29
Alderson Reporting Company

-- a jury to handle without either getting totally

2

confused or totally exhausted.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

4

two answers to that, Justice Souter.

position for which Petitioner argues does not depend on

6

the number of counts.

7

the indictment -

Well, let me -- let me give
First of all, the

If there had been two counts in

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's right, I'm making an

argument that he did not make.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

-- it would be the same.

11

But more fundamentally, I think that the

12

number of counts in this indictment should not lead the

13

Court to think that this was a case in which the

14

government overcharged in some nefarious effort.

15

of all, nefarious efforts like that tend to backfire on

16

the government, and that's why sound prosecution policy

17

dictates against overcharging.

18

fair to regard the number of counts as a proxy for

19

overcharging, and that is because they break up into

20

logically distinct units.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

First

Here I don't think it's

Why not, when considering

22

what the government did on its second chance?

case that the jury was simply exhausted?

3

But isn't the most likely thing in this

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think so, Justice

4

Ginsburg, because all of the insider trading counts turn

5

on the same fact:

6

information, did he know that the Enron broadband system

7

that he was integrally involved in, was the strategic

8

manager in charge of, wasn't working?

9

knowledge and he traded, the number of counts is really

did Petitioner have inside

If he had that

10

irrelevant, and I think that the fact that the jury

11

resolved all of the insider trading counts the same way

12

and the money laundering counts just had to do with the

13

disposition of the proceeds, they're all resolved the

14

same way.

15

The jury obviously deadlocked on whether

16

some fact that the government needed to prove for those

17

counts was established.

18

about Petitioner's position is that he seeks to get

19

through a legal doctrine, collateral estoppel, which is

20

a big extension from what the Double Jeopardy Clause

21

textually prohibits, exactly what the jury would not

22

give him.

23

And the bizarre thing, I think,

The jury CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the -- the

24

point about the big extension, you were rather coy in

25

your brief about what you think about Ashe v. Swenson.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Are you asking us to revisit that?

2

MR. DREEBEN:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

3

think that the Court needs to revisit Ashe v. Swenson in

4

order to resolve this case, but I think it's fair to say

5

that Ashe v. Swenson is a doctrine that transposed

6

certain civil policies that are -- are expressed through

7

the doctrine of issue preclusion into the double

8

jeopardy context in a way that was not supported by the

9

history of the Fifth Amendment and is not supported by

10

the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, which requires

11

the same events.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you're not

13

going to talk about -- you're not going to talk about

14

the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause, are you?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

the case is pretty easy, isn't it?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I If we rely on that

I think that it is because it

19

says that the same offense is what you're protected

20

against for double jeopardy, and the offenses in this

21

case are distinct under Blockburger.

22

about -

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But my point

The person was in

jeopardy on the hung offense as well.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, this Court has made
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

clear that the jeopardy continues until the government

2

has the opportunity to obtain a verdict.

3

that his jeopardy began is not what entitles him to -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the fact

Under this Court's

5

decisions, but not under the text of the Double Jeopardy

6

Clause.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it then becomes a

8

question of what is the meaning of jeopardy.

But

9

insofar as the Court imported collateral estoppel into

10

the Double Jeopardy Clause, it should keep in mind in

11

deciding whether to extend that doctrine that in the

12

civil context a crucial predicate for collateral

13

estoppel is the ability of the adversely affected party

14

to appeal, and that is because before we rely on

15

collateral estoppel, we want to have some assurances

16

that there actually is integrity to the necessarily

17

determined fact that is going to preclude litigation in

18

another case.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the key to your

20

argument is the government is entitled to one full and

include the right to retry if the jury hangs, and here

what the defendant -

the right to retry in the same position as it would have

it had not brought the first proceeding in this case, it

what the government did was to bring all of its cases

19

together.

20

Ashe v. Swenson because I think it strikes everyone as

21

very strange to say that if the jury in Ashe v. Swenson

22

had been presented with all six robbers and had

23

acquitted on only one and had a returned -- you know, an

inability to reach a verdict -

basically says there is a certain situation in which we

government has an opportunity to retry; and the other is

if you accept the proposition that the jury's action was

inconsistent because one of the robbers earned an

16

acquittal and the other five logically should have been

17

the same if the jury had found that the defendant wasn't

One is that when there is a

Collateral estoppel depends on the idea that

20

there is a rational jury, and if the jury has acted

21

inconsistently, we don't have that basis of rationality

22

that supports the policy justifications of collateral

estoppel.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the whole -- whole

assumption that what appears to be an irrational

right to retry.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that's

5

right, and your argument depends upon that interest

6

balancing against the interest in giving effect to the

7

acquittal verdict.

8
9

Now, what if I think, under the Seventh
Amendment that's -- that what is important is protecting

10

jury verdicts?

11

when you have a conviction and acquittal, is that you

12

have two jury verdicts and you can't go one way or the

13

other without undermining one of them.

14

you can give full effect to the verdict of acquittal

15

without undermining another jury verdict.

16

undermine the government's interest in prosecuting after

17

a hung jury, but if I think what's important under the

18

Seventh Amendment is the jury verdicts, then the case

19

comes out the other way, right?

20

And the interest in the irrational case,

MR. DREEBEN:

You certainly

Well, I don't think so, Mr.

Chief Justice, because I think you still have to focus

4

insider information in connection with the substantive

challenge?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Is there any insider

No, Justice Ginsburg, there is

7

not.

The government's theory here was that on the

8

substantive securities fraud count, which related to the

9

January 20th, 2000, analysts meeting, Mr. Yeager was

10

integrally involved in formulating the message and was

11

therefore accountable for misstatements to the

12

marketplace about Enron broadband communications

13

efficacy and effectiveness and technological value.

14

jury, if it rejected that, would acquit on those counts

15

-- on that count, without reaching the question did Mr.

16

Yeager know factually that the statements that were made

17

by others at that analysts conference and in the press

18

releases subsequently were inaccurate?

19

that question is yes, he had the information, then he

20

could be liable for insider trading even though he is

21

not liable for substantive securities fraud because he

22

had nothing to do with creating the statements or

23

misstatements to the marketplace.

And I think I do take issue with

25

Petitioner's suggestion that the theory of this case was

an omissions theory.

The way that Mr. Yeager argued the

2

case to the jury was that I didn't have any involvement

3

in preparing or making statements at that January 20th

4

analysts conference; you can't convict me of what other

5

people may have said.

6

the jury that it had to find that he participated in the

7

scheme and that he either made the statements or caused

8

the statements or omissions to be made.

9

that, it easily acquits on the securities fraud.

And the jury instructions advised

If it rejected
And as

10

a result even if this Court were inclined to apply

11

collateral estoppel across mixed counts in a verdict of

12

acquittals and hung counts, which we submit it should

13

not do, the defendant still has to carry his burden of

14

showing necessarily that the jury resolved an issue of

15

fact in his favor that would preclude the next

16

prosecution.

17
18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, he -- he

carried that burden before the court of appeals.
MR. DREEBEN:

But the court of appeals

20

relied on the view that Mr. Yeager did not contest that

21

he participated in the planning and preparation and

22

statements that were made.

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Revisiting of that

issue was not included within the question presented.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think it's included in

our ability to defend the judgment.

2

in this case made it quite clear that collateral

3

estoppel did not apply because the acquittals could rest

4

on the basis that Mr. Yeager did not participate in the

5

analysts conference and in the press statements that

6

were the basis for the wire fraud and the securities

7

fraud omissions.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The District Court

So if we -- if we

9

agree with you on that proposition, then the conflict

10

that we granted cert to resolve would still continue.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, you could resolve it.

I

12

would hope that you would resolve it in a favor of a

13

disposition that doesn't require you to reach the

14

factual issue, but if the Court resolves the legal issue

15

against us, I think it should revisit the analysis of

16

the court of appeals because government isn't defending

17

the precise way in which the court of appeals went about

18

analyzing the double jeopardy issue, and its question of

19

what facts were necessarily determined was resolved

20

incorrectly, I think, as a matter of clear error.

21

don't even think Mr. Yeager will stand up on rebuttal

22

and tell you that he didn't argue to the jury that his

23

client was not involved in -- in the creation of the

24

statements at that analyst meeting because he did make

25

that argument.

the Court is going to go down a track of allowing

collateral estoppel for mixed verdicts, that it

5

a fact was necessarily decided by the jury.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, on that first

7

theory, and your theory that a retrial on hung counts is

8

always permitted, I -- I take it there are no court of

9

appeals opinions or decisions that agree with you on

10
11

that point, or am I incorrect?
MR. DREEBEN:

They have not reasoned it the

12

way that the government reasons it, but I think that the

13

Fifth Circuit's result is equivalent to what the

14

government argued as well as the D.C. Circuit.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

A different question:

16

Suppose you prevail.

17

the jury hangs again and the jury hangs a second time.

18

Is there any point at which the district court can

19

intervene in the exercise of its own authority and

20

discretion just to dismiss the charges?

21

The hung counts are retried.

MR. DREEBEN:

And

I don't think so, Justice

22

Kennedy, because I think the interest that's being

23

vindicated here is a balance of interests, and it's -

24

as I responded to the Chief Justice and -- and referred

25

to Justice Souter's question earlier, double jeopardy

MR. DREEBEN:

I am not aware whether any

20

States do, but certainly as a matter of double jeopardy,

21

this Court has never suggested that there is.

22

as a matter of common sense, prosecutors who are unable

23

to achieve a verdict after a certain number of trials do

24

tend to conclude that it's not in the interest of

society to keep trying.

I think

2

exception to the rule, and the reason why that's -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But one hung jury followed

4

by a second when there has been an acquittal the first

5

time around is not customary.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

But the -

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So the difference is in

8

the -- in the first trial, you're not impugning the

9

integrity of the jury's verdict.

You're following the

10

acquittal, and that's true in the compromise cases, the

11

Dunn case and those cases, but that's not the case here

12

because you're talking about two different juries.

13

You're saying the second jury should have an -- an

14

opportunity to correct what the first jury did, even

15

though it would not have that opportunity if the first

16

jury had not faced the issue.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- I -- Justice

18

Stevens, all I can say is that if the first jury had

19

really believed that Mr. Yeager acted in good faith and

20

was completely innocent, it should have acquitted on all

21

counts.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:
We know that.

It should have, but it

23

didn't.

And we just know they did not

24

reach a conclusion on this issue, but they did reach a

25

conclusion on the count on which they acquitted.

MR. DREEBEN:

We should have -- we should

2

presume that, as we do in other areas of the law, that

3

the jury followed the instructions that it was given,

4

and the instructions that it was given -

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you make the same

6

presumption when there is an inconsistent verdict, but

7

you say even if it's irrational we'll go along with it

because of the one jury, and they may have had non -

unsound legal reasons for saying, well, we'll let the

10

guy off on the one count.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

But I think that there is no

12

reason for the fact that a jury takes irrational action

13

to then be used for the jury's acquittal to block

14

complete prosecution.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The jury did not take

irrational action in this case.

17

20

in the sense that if a fact necessarily determined

acquittals on the -- on the insider trading counts -

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It would be irrational if

23

they had returned a verdict, but they said we can't

24

agree for who knows why.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

But the point is they should
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have agreed logically if they believed that Mr. Yeager

2

never had inside information or acted in good faith.

3

And the jury is instructed to consider each count, count

4

by count, it was given instructions at the Allen phase

5

of the case that it should strive to achieve a verdict,

6

that Mr. Yeager is entitled to a verdict of not guilty

7

if, in fact, the jury believes that he is not guilty and

8

that it should make every effort to reach the verdict.

9

Now, the fact that it didn't, and it would

10

have been very easy for it to do, if it had determined

11

logically that he did not have inside information, is a

12

reason for hesitating before extrapolating out from

13

those acquittals and blocking the government's

14

opportunity to retry the hung counts.

15

Mr. Yeager's position logically -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's not all that clear,

17

because as you argue the court -- the district court was

18

correct in analyzing the -- the estoppel issue.

it's obviously a very difficult issue because judges

have disagreed about it and the government and your

opponent disagree on it.

was closer to it, which had presided over the trial and

6

MR. DREEBEN:

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9

The jury could not have

I'm not sure that -

If the jury was confused and

it acted in an irrational manner, that's a reason not to

10

apply collateral estoppel, not a reason to do it.

11

Mr. Yeager's theory implies is that if the jury had come

12

back and -- under the Federal Rules of Criminal

13

Procedure it can return partial verdicts.

14

had come back and said we're struggling on some of the

15

counts, we have a partial verdict on others of them, and

16

the judge said, okay, we'll take the partial verdict;

17

and the jury came in and said, we acquit on five counts,

18

that Mr. Yeager's theory would be that the judge should

19

say that's great, collateral estoppel now means you

20

don't get to finish the deliberations on the counts on

which you said you can't agree.

no sense, neither does blocking retrial in this case.

2

But if you view -- if you accept the

proposition that juries only act by returning verdicts,

and that's the reason you can retry, because with a hung

I assume I can answer your

question, Mr. Chief Justice?

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

No, because the -- the logic

of the situation here is that in order for collateral

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL J. BUFFONE

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. BUFFONE:

The Solicitor General has

6

essentially asked this Court to take a metaphysical view

7

of the Double Jeopardy Clause, but the teachings of this

8

Court from Sealfon through Ashe is that the important

9

protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause as applied to

10

issue preclusion must be approached with reason, with

11

rationality, with a non-hypertechnical view in order to

12

protect the public policies that underlie the Double

13

Jeopardy Clause.

from those acquittals is that Mr. Yeager did not possess

At the beginning of this trial we filed two

4

motions, the first challenging the specificity of the

indictment, and the second seeking a Bill of

Particulars.
