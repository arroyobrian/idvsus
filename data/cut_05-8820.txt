ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY C. BONNER

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear arguments

MS. BONNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Mr. Lawrence in this case made an

11

application for relief in the state courts of Florida,

12

that unfortunately was denied to him, the relief that he

13

sought.

14

Supreme Court on a certiorari review and the certiorari,

15

although it was denied, he did present to this Court an

16

issue on which it could have acted had it chosen to act.

17

It is well within the power under 28 U.S.C. 2104 for

18

this Court to modify, vacate, remand.

19

this Court can and could have affected that judgment.

20

Consequently, he came here to the United States

In other words,

Our position is that this -- there is a

21

distinction between the, quote, "appellate jurisdiction"

22

under 2104 and the original writ of certiorari which

23

would lie in this Court in some instances.

24

uses the appeal, one is not making a new application.

25

We respectfully suggest that the utilization of the
3

Alderson Reporting Company

When one

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

emphasis in 2244 should be on application and what was

2

before this Court on petition for certiorari was the

3

application, the document, the issues, which had been

4

presented below in the Florida courts and this Court was

5

sitting to determine whether it would -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would presumably,

7

though, be limited in some ways.

8

application for state post-conviction relief raised

9

arguments under state law, those would not be a proper

10

For example, if the

subject of a petition for certiorari.

11

MS. BONNER:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

12

And the issues which were raised were the same ones that

13

were raised in the state court and were of

14

constitutional dimension that Mr. Lawrence raised here.

15

But our point is if the emphasis is on the application,

16

then until the finality of action on the application -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're saying the

18

application is the application -- the petition for

19

certiorari is the application?

20

MR. PECK:

No, sir.

I'm saying the

21

application under 3850 in Florida state trial courts,

22

which then goes to the Florida State Supreme Court, is

23

the application upon which this Court would be acting.

24

If it were not acting on that, what would it be acting

25

on?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

unless, unless it's final.

the state court, don't we?

MS. BONNER:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Well, we can't act on it
We, we need final action by

Well, except How can it be final action

and yet still be pending?

7

MS. BONNER:

To utilize the word "final"

8

there would be -- we can use the word "final" after a

9

jury determination and that in one effect, in one sense,

10

is final.

11

sense.

12

can modify it, can remand it.

13
14

And when Florida is done it's final in some

But it's not final under 2104 because this Court

application for state review is concerned.

15

MS. BONNER:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17
18

It's final as far as the

There -- it is the Which is the text that

we're dealing with here.
MS. BONNER:

Yes.

It is the application for

19

state review which comes before this Court.

20

asking you to review the lower court's rulings on the

21

application.

22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

We're

I take it you're talking

about language, if I followed it, in 2244(d)(2).

24

MS. BONNER:

Yes, sir.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it tolled the statute
5


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

while the "properly filed application for state

2

post-conviction or other collateral review is pending."

3

So the question is during the 90 days after they said no

4

to you in the state court and you had a chance to file

5

the writ, is that application pending?

6

that application is pending, that application is pending

7

and subject to various motions, such as a motion or a

8

petition for certiorari.

9

MS. BONNER:

Yes, sir.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. BONNER:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

That's where we are in this

argument.
MS. BONNER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MS. BONNER:

18

But it is pending.

Yes, sir that is -

14

17

And you say yes,

That is exactly our position.
Thank you.

That this application is

pending.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, the other

19

way to read the language is that the state application

20

is final -- otherwise you couldn't file the Federal

21

petition for certiorari, and that petition may affect

22

what happens with your application for state relief, but

23

the state application itself is final and over.

24
25

MS. BONNER:

In that sense it is not final

in that it can be altered and that this Court can

Alderson Reporting Company

order -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

final before you can file a petition for cert.

4
5
6

MS. BONNER:

Yes, sir.

Well, it has to be

It's the vagaries of

the use of the language JUSTICE BREYER:

Does it say that?

I would

7

have thought it said that there has to be a final

8

judgment of the lower court, and the final judgment of

9

the state court concerns that application which is still

10

pending and will continue to be pending at least for 90

11

days in your view.

12

MS. BONNER:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

So it doesn't require a

14

final state application.

It requires a final judgment

15

about the state application.

16

MS. BONNER:

Yes, that's exactly true, sir.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what about the

18

argument raised by your friend that exhaustion doesn't

19

require filing a petition for certiorari, that the state

20

procedures are considered fully exhausted upon the final

21

decision in the state court and that it makes sense to

22

treat this, this 2244, in a parallel way with respect to

23

the exhaustion requirement?

24
25

MS. BONNER:

Well, Your Honor, first of all,

it would require this Court to substitute the word
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"exhaustion" for the word "pending" in the statute.

2

There is no reason to believe and there is much reason

3

not to believe that Congress intended exhaustion has a

4

concept which should be read into this particular

5

context in which we're dealing.

6

the 1995 proposal for habeas reform the word

7

"exhaustion" was in there.

8

Unfortunately, the Congressional history and the

9

speeches on the floor, etcetera, are not really

In point of fact, in

It was taken out in 1996.

10

illuminating, except the concept of exhaustion

11

apparently the legislature, the Congress, felt would be

12

subject to interpretation differently in different

13

states.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do you know what

15

is pending with respect to when the state defendant,

16

movant, doesn't file a petition for certiorari?

17

that -

18

MS. BONNER:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is

Well, I believe.
Is the state

20

post-conviction application still pending on the 90th

21

day?

22

MS. BONNER:

I believe it is, Your Honor,

23

and I think the logic that this Court has used in the

24

context of 2255's obtains as well, and it -- it is

25

pending because the reason that we have 90 days -- it's
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

an unusual amount of time that we have to come to ask

2

this Court for relief.

3

time and part of the reason for the existence of that is

4

that we can contemplate whether we should be filing a

5

petition for certiorari.

6

And I believe that part of that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, anybody who

7

wants the additional time -- this law was passed to

8

prevent people from delaying.

9

delay would then have to file a cert petition, I assume?

10

MS. BONNER:

But anybody who wanted to

I would suggest to you, Your

11

Honor, that it should be -- this should be construed the

12

same way that the finality of a state conviction, the

13

finality of a Federal conviction, and the finality of a

14

2255 are determined, and that is at the time that either

15

this Court has dealt with certiorari by denying or

16

granting it or that 90 days has, has been -

17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if you filed -

so you say you get 90 days whether you file or not?

19

MS. BONNER:

Yes, I do, sir.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if you want the

21

additional time that it takes for an opposition, for

22

waiver of response, for this court to dispose of it,

23

then you have to file a petition for cert?

24
25

MS. BONNER:
position, Your Honor.

I don't -- that is not my
I believe that the 90 days should
9


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obtain no matter what so that we'll have a universal

2

rule.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MS. BONNER:

Right.

-- that practitioners will not

5

be making this error because they will be acting in

6

concert -

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the Chief's point is

8

that if a petition is in fact found it will end up being

9

more than 90 days because then you would have, in

10

addition to the 90 days you'd have to file the cert

11

petition, the time it takes for this Court to dispose of

12

the petition, and the statute of limitations would be

13

tolled throughout that entire period, not just a fixed

14

90 days.

15

MS. BONNER:

That is true, ma'am.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you -- does your

17

argument mean that a defendant who wanted to file within

18

the 90 days, wanted to file in the district court,

19

wanted to file the habeas application in the district

20

court within the 90 days, couldn't do so because it

21

would be premature because the, the state application is

22

still pending?

23

MS. BONNER:

I believe that the way that we

24

have been seeing the opinions come from this Court and

25

from the various courts around the country are that
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there seems to be a favorable disposition to protective

2

2254, 2255 petitions.

3

Honor's question that it would be pending and it would

4

be pending here and therefore, you should not go to

5

district court and file a 2254.

6

you can do it in a protective fashion is another entire

7

issue which isn't really raised here because he did seek

8

certiorari review.

9

I agree with the premise of Your

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now whether you can and

Do you read the tolling

10

provision in 2263(B) the same way as you read the

11

tolling provision that's before us?

12

MS. BONNER:

No.

Certainly I do not.

And

13

the state really did not analogize to 2263 as I believe

14

perhaps they should have analogized to it.

15

course is the opt-in provision which moves things along

16

on an even quicker track than a one year, and you have

17

180 days to file, and the Congress was absolutely clear

18

and this was enacted at the same time that the

19

provisions at issue were enacted, that it was 180 days

20

after final state court affirmance and you had to, you

21

had to file.

22

2263 of

That's it.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think Congress really

23

wanted to have two different, entirely different tolling

24

concepts in these provisions?

25

MS. BONNER:

I think they did, and one of
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the reasons that I believe that they did, number one was

2

to achieve their goal of moving things faster if the

3

states were able to guarantee counsel, and the second is

4

that they told, as well, in 2263(B) the main difference

5

between 2263(A) and (B)(1) is that the time when you're

6

getting your certiorari petition ready for this Court

7

under the opt-in provision is not tolled.

8

when this Court is considering the post-conviction

9

certiorari request is tolled.

But the time

It's tolled clearly by

10

statute.

11

what Congress did was write these in numerical order and

12

when it got to 2263 come up with a new and exciting

13

idea, and then not go back to 2254 and 2244 to change

14

the language there.

15

I cannot presume and would not presume that

I think Congress meant something different.

16

And what it meant was the trigger time, the time that

17

was going to be elapsing between the petition, between

18

your final decision and when you could go to certiorari.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You know, what about

20

2244(D)(1)(a) where Congress referred expressly to the

21

time for seeking direct review or the expiration of the

22

time for seeking such review?

23

that that's what they meant when they said the state

24

application was pending.

25

time for seeking review of the state application, and in

Your reading of D(2) is

The state application or the

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- just in just a few sections above that they expressly

2

said that shouldn't we read pending in a different,

3

different direction?

4

MS. BONNER:

Well, the distinction, I have

5

at least two things to say about that.

The distinction

6

between the two sections, that would be (D)(1)(a) and

7

(D)(2), one is dealing with one thing, a judgment which

8

has reached finality and it is determining when that

9

judgment is final.

They would have had to rewrite the

10

tolling provision because it is not speaking about a

11

judgment.

12

a process.

13

It is speaking about an application which is
And the second thing is that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they would

14

have just said during the time of the application for

15

state post-conviction, or the expiration of the time for

16

seeking review of it.

17

MS. BONNER:

I believe that Congress is

18

presumed to have read, written its laws knowing the

19

history of interpretation of this Court.

20

has a very long tradition and this Court's role in the

21

state-Federal continuum obviously is of well defined 200

22

plus-year-old role, and the part of that role is that

23

you as this Court are the final arbiters and the only

24

true people who can make the decision about what the

25

Federal Constitution says.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

And pending

The state would have you read this as if it

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think the final, the

12

judgment in the criminal case is still pending because

13

it can be acted upon?

14

MS. BONNER:

Not the judgment in the

15

criminal case, but I would suggest that the judgment in

16

the 22 -- I mean the 385.1 procedures in Florida which

17

would be that post-conviction application because that's

18

where we are.

19

20

Court for certiorari or the 90 days is exhausted.

22

arguing that there, during this period, there is an

14
Alderson Reporting Company

14

Not in the state court anymore.

It doesn't say pending, as your statute,

MS. BONNER:

Yes, ma'am.

It just is, also,

I -- there is some case law which speaks to the fact

that it remains pending or unsettled or unsure or

In the same sense that it

But nobody denies

And I understood your argument to

MS. BONNER:

That is -- that is so,

sir.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But in what sense is

12

it an application for state post-conviction review when

13

it's pending before us?

14

the state erroneously decided a Federal question -

We are considering a claim that

15

MR. BONNER:

You are -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- but it's not an

17

application, it's an application for our review, not

18

state post-conviction review.

19

MS. BONNER:

It began as a complaint.

This

20

is, analytically, everyone seems to have a little bit of

21

pause because of exactly the context of your, of your

22

comment, of your question.

23

lawsuit, complaint, whatever you wish to call it, which

24

we are dealing with, and that is the one that seeks

25

post-conviction relief in Florida.

But there is only one

16
Alderson Reporting Company

If you're

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unsuccessful there, you go to the Florida Supreme Court

2

and that same application is what we come to this Court

on.

4

to tell us, or suggest to us that it's some kind of an

5

independent state -- uh, Federal action.

6

There is nothing else out there.

JUSTICE ALITO:

The state seems

It's a Federal writ, isn't

7

it?

8

an appeal in state criminal -- state case.

9

It's an application for a Federal writ.

MS. BONNER:

It's not

But it comes under this Court's

10

appellate jurisdiction versus its original jurisdiction

11

for writs of certiorari.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you succeed you're going

13

to get an order from this Court to the state court say,

14

saying, go back in this state proceeding that has been

15

begun, and do it right.

16

state proceeding even though we may correct it under

17

appellate jurisdiction.

18

MS. BONNER:

So the focus of it is still the

Yes, sir.

The state brings

19

forward an argument that this certiorari before this

20

Court is not a part of, not an integral part of and in

21

fact not any part of the state process.

22

come to that conclusion because they insert what they

23

wish the statute said, rather than what the statute

actually says, and we are attempting as best we can to

average disposition time is for a petition for

5

MS. BONNER:

I believe it's like 44 days if

No.

filing for petition for cert, opposition, waiver, our

MS. BONNER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now I guess -- my

4

question is, in a law that imposed a one-year statute of

5

limitation, is this an implicit additional, I realize

6

it's a question begging to some extent, but implicitly

7

an additional six-month period would strike me as odd.

MS. BONNER:

Well, Your Honor, it is not a

one-year statute of limitations per se.

That may be

10

what looks good on paper with the writing of the statute

11

and the expressing of the statute to the public, that

12

one year is what's going to happen.

13

into account the exhaustion requirement and takes that

14

time out, we are still not talking about a 365-day

15

process.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But when one takes

Let me ask on that,

17

Ms. Bonner, what typically in Florida is the time

18

elapsed between the conclusion of the criminal

MS. BONNER:

It's quite a while.

The question is whether

10

there may be another six months added on to that five or

11

six-year period.

12
13

MS. BONNER:

Yes, sir.

And one of the

important things here is -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the reason

that's tolled is because it's designed to encourage the

before a Federal court.

which is pending for your review.

And one of the things

21

I want to point out is that the 90 days, when they

22

passed habeas reform, they were not speaking about 30

23

days, 20 days, 60 days, 90 days or even the six months

24

that Your Honor posits.

25

years.

It was 10 years, 12 years, 14

And that was I think the major impetus to
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

encourage the Congress to put the 365 day on there.

2

This Court has complete control over the

3

certiorari process.

You know, being lawyers we always

4

do file at the last minute, but of course it's this

5

Court's rules which gives us the 90 days versus another

6

period of time.

7

not like a notice of appeal, because it's not just a

8

one-page document that's laid out in the Federal

9

statutes for us to do.

It is, the petition for certiorari is

It's an application to, it's an

16

17

MS. BONNER:

In other

I don't know how many are

granted, Your Honor, but one thing that struck me as I

19

was reading through these cases is that many are granted

20

to the state.

certiorari from post-conviction, from a post-conviction

22

certiorari to the state.

25

that happens with this tolling if you read pending the

2

we do then?

What do people do?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MS. BONNER:

not looking forward to further -

No, but if the state

How do you count that time if you lose here?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose you'd have to

11

file a protective petition with the district court

12

saying we won but we might still lose.

13

MS. BONNER:

I guess.

And - you know, a

14

protective -- to litigants, protective and to district

15

court judges, I believe and state court judges,

16

protective petitions are kind of anathema, because since

17

you don't know what you're going to raise -- and in the

18

2254 you have more of an idea, certainly, because you're

19

limited in many instances if not all instances to those

20

things which were exhausted -- but obviously there are

21

new claims that are brought up because there would not

22

be a stay and abey.

23

for stay and abey if there were things that the Federal

24

courts find.

25

There would not even be a request

Assuming you make

the same argument you make on questions 2 and 3 about

2

the availability of equitable tolling.

3

MS. BONNER:

I'm sorry.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I didn't I would be very

5

surprised if the court found you were out of time

6

because the state had filed a petition for certiorari.

7

MS. BONNER:

I'd be surprised -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MS. BONNER:

I'd be surprised too, but I've

10

practiced a long time and I've seen some very odd things

11

happen in courts and, both a stay and abey, and the

12

other procedures that have been discussed by this Court

13

have not been handed down as mandates to the lower court

14

to require the lower court to rule in a certain way, or

15

to absolutely stay, or to entertain protective motions

16

and then permit those protective motions to be

supplemented at a time later.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. KISE

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

23

MR. KISE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24

please the Court:

Petitioner's case amounts to no more

25

than a disagreement with AEDPA's recognized policies and
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

procedures, and an improper attempt to convert ignorance

2

of settled law into an extraordinary circumstance

3

warranting equitable relief.

4

recognized purpose is established, that tolling does not

5

extend to the post-conviction certiorari process.

6

Additionally, ignorance of settled law whether by an

7

incarcerated pro se petitioner, by private counsel, or

8

by appointed counsel is not an extraordinary

9

circumstance and does not excuse prompt filing.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

AEDPA's plain language and

Mr. Kise, can I ask you

11

what your view in this matter would be if the Court

12

grants certiorari, would the application be pending

13

during the period that the case is under advisement in

14

this Court?

15

MR. KISE:

No, Your Honor.

And I'm assuming

16

your question is asking me, grant certiorari based on an

17

application filed by the petitioner.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

MR. KISE:

Either way.

Well, in both circumstances the

20

answer would be no, and in both circumstances I think

21

the relief that would be accorded -

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask a second

23

question.

Suppose it were reversed, we send it back for

24

further proceedings in the state trial court, would you

25

say that it's still not pending during the further
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

proceedings?

2

MR. KISE:

It may be pending in state court

3

during the further proceedings, but it's not pending

4

during the time that it is at this Court, because this

5

Court has not -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So it started pending

7

again after an interruption, is that the way it would

8

be?

9
10
11

MR. KISE:

Based on equitable principles, I

think that would be the interpretation, yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Forget about equitable

12

principles, statutory principles.

13

continuity, where you could have it pending for a period

14

of a couple years and then an interruption, and then it

15

can resume pending after the interruption?

19
20

MR. KISE:

Is there a lack of

You're using the phraseology

interruption, and I would, would JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, period when it's not

pending followed by a period when it begins to pend.
MR. KISE:

In that unusual circumstance,

21

Your Honor, I think principles of equitable tolling

22

would apply to keep the petitioner's ability to file.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But there would be no

24

statutory right in your view, it would depend on the

25

equitable considerations?
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KISE:

I believe that's correct, Your

2

Honor, because statutory pending contemplates a

3

finality, it contemplates -- and I think that this is,

4

it is one of the fundamental problems, I believe, with

5

petitioner's construction, is this ignoring of not only

6

the plain language of the statute but what this Court

7

has said about this statute, about 2244(d)(2).

Yes, Your Honor, I believe it is,

and I believe that's what this Court said -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

By the same token, why

isn't it pending between the final disposition by the

24

state appellate court and the determination to seek cert

25

here?
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KISE:

Well, I have two answers to that,

2

Your Honor.

3

the language utilized by this Court in Carey where the

4

Court defined pending as until final resolution through

5

the state's post-conviction -

6
7

First would be, that's inconsistent with

JUSTICE BREYER:
case.

That was the issue in that

This issue wasn't in that case.

8

MR. KISE:

9

language utilized nevertheless -

10

Correct, Your Honor, but the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I can't when I write

11

something, I don't think I or anyone else can, if it

12

happens to be a state case, refrain from using the word

13

state.

14

writing an opinion that it doesn't mean Federal as well.

15

As least I can't find that written in the opinion

16

anywhere.

17

I wouldn't say there is an implication in

MR. KISE:

Fair enough, Your Honor.

Then

18

with respect to the second part of my answer to your

19

question, Justice Souter, that it cannot be both final

20

for 1257 purposes and pending -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But why isn't your sister's

22

answer to that adequate?

It is the state judgment that

23

is final, but action on the petition is not yet final

24

until it has gone through the period allowed for final

25

review by this Court.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KISE:

I would, I would respectfully

2

disagree with that, with that nondistinction, if you

3

will, Your Honor, in the sense that the application -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you're distinguishing

5

between a state judgment and an application upon which

6

further, further proceedings can be had.

7

nondistinction?

8
9

MR. KISE:

Why is that a

Because I would, I would disagree

with the notion that further proceedings could be had on

that application.

11

of jurisdiction is that it is subject to no further

12

review or correction in any state.

The basis for this Court's certiorari

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let's assume that the, the

14

petition for cert is granted and this Court grants

15

relief.

something wrong on this application before, go back and

do it over again and do it right.

and that therefore, it is the state application that

21

necessarily is the subject of the cert petition.

The relief as I understand it is going to

MR. KISE:

It's the -- it is the

I would say, Your Honor, that the

23

state application may be the subject matter of what you

24

are looking at from a subject matter standpoint, but

25

what the Court is ruling on is the petition for
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

certiorari, which was a Federal court ruling on JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's a petition for

3

certiorari to review action taken on a state petition,

4

just as at the state level, whatever may be the, the

5

nomenclature for filing an appeal from the state trial

6

court to the state appellate court, is an application

7

which relates entirely to the original application for

8

relief that was filed in the state trial court.

9

seems to me the two situations are exactly parallel.

10

MR. KISE:

It

And I would respectfully

11

disagree, Your Honor, because I don't see how it can be

12

final for 1257 purposes and still pending for purposes

13

of the statute.

JUSTICE GINSBERG:

But that -- that -

MR. KISE:

2

The state's province has been completed.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4
5

It is final.

It is over.

But they would correct it

if we told them to.
MR. KISE:

In that circumstance, yes, Your

6

Honor, certainly they would in a circumstance, in the

7

very unusual circumstance where this Court were to

8

accept certiorari and then subsequent to the acceptance

9

of certiorari, then reverse the ruling.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And when it got back in

11

the state supreme court, they would still be working on

12

the application that had been pending until the end of

13

the proceedings down there, and then suddenly came back

14

to life after we sent it back.

15

MR. PECK:

Yes, Your Honor, but that is,

16

again, the extraordinary circumstance.

17

points out the, one of the flaws in petitioner's

18

argument, and that is that that's making the exception

19

the rule, that clearly Congress did not intend to add

20

what I believe Chief Justice Roberts alluded to earlier,

21

an extra three months, an extra six months.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that I think

I think what you're saying,

23

though, is when you have ambiguous language, a sensible

24

rule is not a rule, it has to have a lot of exceptions

25

to make sense.

Surely that's a sound principle, isn't
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it?

2

MR. KISE:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I don't

3

think that this would be a lot of exceptions.

I think

4

this would be, the only exception would be, to the rule

5

that we are advocating would be in the unusual

6

circumstance, the one in 5,000 cases, the one in 1,000

7

cases, the exceptional case where this Court actually

8

grants certiorari, those cases are exceptional in and of

9

themselves.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Those are the most likely

11

where people are going to get mixed up.

12

following -- I think I think this argument about the

13

word is metaphysical, you know, and I can make wonderful

14

arguments, and you have made wonderful arguments on both

15

sides of this.

16

I were right about that and there is no clear answer

17

from the language, then the thing, I'd like to go back

18

to Justice Stevens' question, because it seems to me

19

that that puts my greatest concern, my greatest concerns

20

are practical.

21

right next to each other, near each other in the same

22

statutory provision, meaning different things.

23

learned out of my own experience perhaps, judges and

24

lawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up.

25

And they will get mixed up all the time, and when they

I mean, I'm not

I just can't get a clear answer.

So if

And I've

is what happens in the case, and those are the ones who

intuitively are going to cause the problem.

good Supreme Court case.

And now what happens?

On

your interpretation, I just see a mess, and on the other

11

interpretation, it seems to work out fine.

would say are the two practical problems, and anything

13

you would like to say about that, I'd like to listen to.

14

MR. KISE:

would respectfully answer your question I think in three

16

ways.

17

state petitions for certiorari and when the habeas

19

circumstances, equitable principles would apply, but

20

they would apply in I think different ways.

21

either circumstance, the ability of the petitioner to

subsequently seek habeas review would be protected.

so what we are advocating is not making those

24

exceptional cases the rule.

13

part of the petitioner is if the petitioner did

everything he or she could under that circumstance,

because there would be no way for that petitioner to

inconsistent with what Congress intended here because

5

what Congress intended by this provision was to provide

6

petitioner -- well, what this Court said in Duncan, what

7

this Court has recognized, is that the scheme that has

8

been put together here by Congress is one which

9

encourages petitioners first to file and exhaust their

And I don't think that's

10

state remedies, recognizing and giving deference to the

11

principles of comity, and then second to file, once

12

they're done with their state process, once they've

13

completed the state process and exhausted their state

14

remedies, to file their Federal habeas, in the words of

15

this Court in Duncan, "as soon as possible."

16

And the anomaly that would be created by

17

petitioner's construction would be it would be the only

18

time under all of AEDPA where a petitioner could file in

19

Federal district court but isn't required to file.

20

so I would submit to this Court that it cannot be both

exhausted and pending at the same time.

view as being the personal experience.

I'm rather

these preliminary steps when the case is on cert and

they may not have to.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'll think about

depends on how often cert is going to be granted,

doesn't it?

either hold of them whenever a cert petition is filed,

In the non-capital cases

there is an interest in promptness, but the longer the

15

soon as you can.

I understand it is whether in most death cases we'll add

whether he is going to do something else.

place and in the one in one thousand or perhaps more

than that -- and I don't pretend to have the exact

number or the statistics -- but in the very, very usual

12

circumstance where cert is actually granted, I think

13

then a stay could be put in place.

14

it's fair to say, respectfully, that Congress intended

15

to forestall this entire process while this Court

16

undertakes certiorari review.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I don't think

Mr. Kise, there are two

18

applications.

Your answer to the petitioner is you have

19

to file in the Federal court within that 31 days.

prisoner says, I can't manage a cert petition and a

21

Federal habeas corpus, it's hard enough for me to get

22

any assistance, so I'll have to pick one or the other,

23

isn't the, the reading of an ambiguous statute that

24

you're proposing going to be an incentive or a

25

disincentive to filing both, which the prisoner has a

If a

Official - Subject to Final Review

right to do?

He is going to have to pick one or the

2

other if he is in this timeline.

3

MR. KISE:

Well, respectfully, Your Honor -

4

and I know that that is the petitioner's argument and I

5

see that you have given me that question, but I don't

6

know that it is that much of a choice.

7

that they can file, they can file both in those

8

circumstances and, and depending on the particular

9

circumstances -- and this is back to the equitable

I mean, I think

10

tolling principles -- for statutory tolling purposes, I

11

think the answer is they must file both or they forfeit

12

the right to one or the other.

13

file for cert, then they voluntarily if they pass the 90

14

days forfeited that right; and if they don't file within

15

the statutory period then they have under AEDPA missed

16

the statute of limitations deadline.

17

If they choose not to

But I would, I submit to you that it is

18

possible to do both, and in circumstances where there is

19

some impediment to them doing just that, if they

20

exercise diligence, if they are doing everything they

21

possibly can and it is not possible to file both at the

22

same time, well, then I think under the facts of the

23

proper scenario that equitable principles might apply.

24

But again, to say that Congress built into the system

25

this automatic time period that's going to be tacked on
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to a very short one-year statute of limitations, a

2

statute of limitations that is designed to really move

3

things through the system rapidly, is, respectfully, I

4

don't think the correct interpretation of the language,

5

and I don't think it is consistent with what this Court

6

said in Duncan or, with respect to Justice Breyer, what

7

this Court said in Carey.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let me be clear on your

answer to Justice Stevens' earlier question.

Where

10

there is a reversal of the state judgment by, by this

11

Court, and the case is remanded to the state, you don't

12

argue that what occurs then is equitable tolling?

13

you say that the case is again pending once it goes back

14

to the state, is that right?

15

MR. KISE:

But

I think once it's back in the

16

state system then it would have to be considered

17

pending, because the statute contemplates that while

18

it's part of the state process it would be pending.

MS. BONNER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To get the

additional time for an opposition that would be

considered here, you have to file the petition for cert.

6

it's no longer pending.

7

MS. BONNER:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Absolutely.
Okay.

So then why

wouldn't the result of your position be that every

10

person who is denied state post-conviction relief is

going to file a cert position to get the additional

way to string it out under your reading, but not under

If Congress was concerned that people

MS. BONNER:

Well, Congress couldn't have

been too concerned about that 90 days because it

it's not that application from state court.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does your argument -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess you could also say

14

that except in capital cases the defendant will not have

an incentive to delay.

MS. BONNER:

He wants to get out, right?
Of course, of course.

And you

17

know, frankly, I think all of the defendants on death

row -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, if the

20

defendant had no incentive to delay, why did Congress

21

think it necessary to impose the statue of limitations?

22

They did that because they thought people were stringing

23

out their -- and they were applying for Federal habeas

24

after too long of a delay.

MS. BONNER:
