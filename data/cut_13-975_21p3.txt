 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

argument first this morning in Case 13975, TMobile

South v. the City of Roswell, Georgia. 

6

 Mr. Fisher. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 

8

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

9

 MR. FISHER: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Local governments violate the inwriting 

12

requirement of Section 332 when they fail to issue a 

13

document separate from the administrative record that 

14

specifies the reasons for denying an application to 

15

construct a personal wireless facility.  Any other 

16

construction would flout the very purpose of this 

17

provision, which is to enable meaningful judicial 

18

review.  Indeed, allowing local governments to deny 

19

applications without specifying their reasons would 

20

require district courts across the country to embark 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's not actually what 

22

the court below said.  It said that it could discern the 

23

reasons from the record.  That's a very different 

24

statement than saying there are no reasons set forth. 

25

 MR. FISHER: 

Justice Sotomayor, I'm not sure

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Eleventh Circuit did actually specify what the 

2

reasons were.  It did pronounce that it believed that 

3

the administrative record contained reasons.  We don't 

4

deny that there are a bevy of potential reasons in the 

5

district courts  I'm sorry, in the administrative 

6

record.  I counted nine or ten as I read the transcript 

7

and the minutes.  The problem is we don't know which one 

8

of those were the City's real reasons for denying the 

9

permit, and therefore, we can't have the expedited 

10
11

proceeding that Section 332 contemplates. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, how far does your 

12

argument go?  Suppose the  suppose the instrument of 

13

denial, the letter, does not list any reasons, but it 

14

incorporates by reference or makes reference to some 

15

other document that sets out the reasons.  Is that 

16

sufficient? 

17

 MR. FISHER: 

We think that if the denial 

18

letter was clearly  clearly directed us to some other 

19

document and said  and said where the reasons were, 

20

and that document was contemporaneously available, we 

21

think that would be enough. 

22

 Now, neither of those things are present 

23

here.  There's no explicit reference to any particular 

24

reasons in the minutes.  It just simply says the reasons 

25

are available, and of course, as the Solicitor General

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

has pointed out, the minutes were not available. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  Well, suppose 

that 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Justice Alito. 

Just to follow up, I'm sorry 

6

to interrupt.  Suppose the letter doesn't make a 

7

specific reference to some other document, but there is 

8

some other document known to the parties that has been 

9

approved by the town council and sets out the reasons, 

10

that would not be sufficient.  There has to be an 

11

express reference in the instrument of denial. 

12

 MR. FISHER: 

Right.  I think the question 

13

is, what does the decision say?  That's the statutory 

14

term.  And so, the decision needs to provide the 

15

reasons.  Now, you could have a situation like the 

16

Omnipoint case in the Sixth Circuit where instead of 

17

getting a separate letter like we got in this case, you 

18

get a resolution from the city council specifying the 

19

reasons, and we think that would be enough as well.  All 

20

we want to know is why  why the application was denied 

21

so that we can decide, first of all, whether to bring a 

22

suit or try to negotiate with the local government.  And 

23

second of all 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
I'm sorry, go ahead.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

No, that's not 

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

And second of all, so the 

2

district court can do the streamlined work that Section 

3

332 contemplates. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But that's not all 

5

you want.  Let's say on Monday you get a letter that 

6

says your application is denied.  And on Friday the city 

7

council says the reasons we denied the application were 

8

because of this, this, and this.  Is that enough for 

9

you? 

10

 MR. FISHER: 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

 MR. FISHER: 

13
14

No, it would not be enough 
No. 

 because the letter needs to 

tell us why. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It doesn't matter 

15

that four days or three days, whatever is later, there 

16

is a resolution that doesn't say it's denied, it says 

17

the reason we denied it is this.  That's not good 

18

enough? 

19

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I think you'd have it in 

20

a timing question, the Solicitor General frames, whether 

21

that was substantially contemporaneous.  We think that 

22

it 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

24

 MR. FISHER: 

25

I know. 

 needs to be in a single 

document.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It has to be in a 

2

single document.  What if it's stapled together?  You 

3

know, here's one, it says denied.  And here's one 

4

saying, the next day, the reasons we denied it is  are 

5

these. 

6
7
8
9
10
11

 MR. FISHER: 

I think stapled together would 

be just fine. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no.  What if 

they're not stapled together? 
 MR. FISHER: 

Oh, I'm sorry.  I 

misunderstood. 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 MR. FISHER: 

Make it easier for myself.  No, 

14

we think that the statutory term is definition  sorry, 

15

is decision, is a singular.  So it needs to be put 

16

together. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But decision  decision, 

18

Mr. Fisher, often means just denied.  There  there is 

19

one statute was mentioned in the brief at  this is 47 

20

U.S.C. 546 (c)(3), "The franchising authority shall 

21

issue a written decision."  That's one sentence.  Next 

22

sentence, "Such decision shall state the reasons 

23

therefore."  So the requirement of a decision alone 

24

doesn't necessitate that reasons be given. 

25

 MR. FISHER: 

Justice Ginsburg, we think it's

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fine to look at other provisions of the Communications 

2

Act.  That one particular provision stands apart from 

3

the several other provisions that the Chamber of 

4

Commerce cited around page 10 of its brief and that we 

5

cite in our brief where the word "decision" is used by 

6

itself and in context clearly to mean a specification of 

7

reasons.  Where the Communications Act contemplates no 

8

statement of reasons, it uses words like "notify" or 

9

"order."  And so we think it's perfectly fine to look at 

10

the whole Act.  That one provision is the only 

11

countervailing piece of evidence. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Your bottom line is 

13

because of this supposed default, you get your  your 

14

application is granted, and that seems odd when the 

15

thrust of this arrangement is that the decision should 

16

be in the hands of the local governing board or the 

17

local council or something.  And then to say because of 

18

the procedural lapse, then you emerge the winner and it 

19

doesn't matter what good reasons the town might have 

20

had. 

21

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, there's two important 

22

things about that, Justice Ginsburg.  First is the 

23

ordinary remedy is an injunction.  We think that's the 

24

ordinary remedy.  That's an equitable remedy that, of 

25

course, isn't absolute.  And the second reason is, is

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

why that's the remedy.  Remember, the whole purpose of 

2

this Act is to defeat local intransigents.  In other 

3

words, process is the problem, not the solution.  So 

4

simply requiring additional process, additional time, 

5

additional reasons, that's exactly what the Act is 

6

designed to solve, that problem that existed before 

7

1996. 

8
9
10
11
12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I suppose that could 

be left up to the district court on remand. 
 MR. FISHER: 

Of course, Justice Kennedy. 

The Eleventh Circuit didn't reach the remedy question. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Let me ask you, I think we 

13

would have a much different case if at the time of the 

14

written notice, they appended the official copy of the 

15

transcript.  Is the problem here that the transcript was 

16

too late? 

17

 MR. FISHER: 

18

not the only problem. 

19

That's one problem, but it's 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Because it seems to me you 

20

don't make the lateness part  you don't make the 

21

lateness argument that the government makes in your 

22

in your question presented.  You do say that there has 

23

to be a  whether documents stating the application 

24

been denied but providing no reasons.  So I suppose we 

25

can imply from that that you think that the later copy

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

of the transcript is  is just not applicable. 
 MR. FISHER: 

That's right, Justice Kennedy. 

3

We think that's one problem, but it's not the only 

4

problem.  Even if the 

5
6
7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But do you  I'm 

sorry. 
 MR. FISHER: 

Even if the transcript had been 

8

attached, there still wouldn't have been, based on this 

9

letter, a specification of reasons.  And I'd be happy to 

10

walk the Court through exactly why that's so if you 

11

have a question. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, before you do 

13

so, why is the transcript required?  They had minutes 

14

that summarized the testimony.  Your position is not 

15

that the transcript had to be attached. 

16

 MR. FISHER: 

No, it's not.  I think Justice 

17

Kennedy asked me if the transcript had been attached, 

18

and so I was saying that  taking  taking that 

19

question as  as I got it. 

20
21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
sorry. 

22

 MR. FISHER: 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

24
25

But if the  I'm 

The minutes would be enough 
I may not have 

followed this.  If the transcript were attached, what? 
 MR. FISHER: 

Then that would not be enough

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on its own 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

3

 MR. FISHER: 

Oh, okay. 

 because the letter would 

4

still need to tell us where in the transcript the 

5

reasons were.  And I'd like to walk the Court through 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Fisher, you're deriving 

7

all this from the word "decision" and "decision" as even 

8

the dictionary you principally cite, Blacks Law 

9

Dictionary states, "decision," you know, can mean one of 

10

two things.  It can mean an opinion or it can mean a 

11

judgment, and people refer to it  use that word to 

12

refer to either.  So why should we interpret it your 

13

way? 

14

 MR. FISHER: 

For two reasons, Justice Kagan. 

15

One is because the overall context of the Act and the 

16

substantial evidence review requirement and the overall 

17

purpose tell us that "decision" needs to specify 

18

reasons.  You can't conduct substantial evidence review 

19

until you know what the reasons are. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, that only suggests 

21

that you need reasons.  It doesn't suggest that the 

22

reasons have to appear in a decision as opposed to some 

23

other document. 

24
25

 MR. FISHER: 

Fair enough.  So one other part 

of the Act, which is the expedited review provision, I

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think, also is instructive.  The idea that Congress had 

2

in mind was that parties could show up in a district 

3

court and go straight to the question whether evidence 

4

in the record supported the city's decision.  Congress 

5

did not contemplate what we would have under the City's 

6

approach or even the Solicitor General's approach, which 

7

is an entire first phase of litigation devoted to 

8

figuring out what those reasons are. 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But the larger problem 

10

here, of course, is that under your view, the Federal 

11

statute says that a local legislative body has to act 

12

like an administrative agency, and that raises very 

13

serious concern under Federalism.  In the  in the law 

14

of zoning, generally  forget this Act  in the law of 

15

zoning generally, if you go to the board of supervisors 

16

and want to rezone the property from agriculture to 

17

multifamily residential, do we say that due process 

18

requires them to give some reason?  Is there anything in 

19

the law of zoning generally that says you have to give 

20

reasons? 

21

 MR. FISHER: 

I don't think generally.  If 

22

there were a liberty interest or a property interest at 

23

stake 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

v. Kelley for ­ zoning.

It would be like Goldberg 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

Right.  And we cite in our 

2

brief the Wolff v. McDonnell case, which says that when 

3

liberty or property interests are at stake, minimal due 

4

process requires a specification of reasons.  And it's 

5

not the only time that cities provide specifications of 

6

reasons.  They do it on their own.  If you look at J 

7

(a)(84) and if you look at Footnote 4 of our reply 

8

brief, we cite numerous instances where the city takes 

9

it upon itself already to provide reasons for denials of 

10
11

permits.  They do it 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Fisher, could you 

12

explain how you are disadvantaged?  Now, first of all, 

13

what happens on remand to the district court in your 

14

view?  The Eleventh Circuit rendered its decision, the 

15

case is remanded, what happens on remand? 

16

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, as the case stands now, 

17

we prevailed in the district court and the district 

18

court gave us an injunction allowing the site to be 

19

constructed.  The city took an appeal to the Eleventh 

20

Circuit which reversed on the question of whether the 

21

Act was violated.  So I think what would happen, after 

22

this Court rules, it would go back to the Eleventh 

23

Circuit with the case in that  in that posture. 

24

 If I could say a couple more things about 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Then what would  then

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if this Court should uphold the Eleventh Circuit, then 

2

what happens? 

3

 MR. FISHER: 

If you uphold the Eleventh 

4

Circuit, then we go back down to the district court and 

5

are going to 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

7

 MR. FISHER: 

And what happens there? 
And I think there we're going 

8

to have to have one of these prolonged proceedings to 

9

decide what  first of all, what the reasons are.  The 

10

city has already filed one brief in the district court, 

11

before this case started to go up on appeal, where it 

12

took the position that there were three reasons for its 

13

denial:  Property values, the fact that TMobile 

14

allegedly already had sufficient service in the area, 

15

and compatibility with the neighborhood. 

16

 The city, in this Court, has offered some 

17

different reasons.  The Solicitor General offers a still 

18

different take on the transcript and the minutes.  And 

19

so, first we have to have in the district court one of 

20

these first mini hearings that I've been describing. 

21

And then we would, perhaps, then be able to litigate the 

22

question Congress contemplated, which is substantial 

23

evidence followed by some other arguments we might make. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Fisher, assume, and 

just for the sake of argument, that we do say that a

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

separate writing that clearly sets forth or sets forth 

2

the reasons for denial is adequate.  I understand you to 

3

say that this is not adequate because it's not clear 

4

presumably; am I correct? 

5

 MR. FISHER: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
Under this board's 

7

rules, do  I'm assuming the board has to be unanimous, 

8

majoritarian voting rules, but why does every council 

9

member have to have the same reason?  Can't different 

10
11

people say no for different reasons? 
 MR. FISHER: 

I think, Justice Sotomayor, 

12

they might be able to.  The ordinary course would be a 

13

letter that provides reasons that speak for the entire 

14

council.  But I wouldn't deem it impossible for a letter 

15

to come to us that says two city council members voted 

16

to deny the application for this reason and two others 

17

voted to deny the application for another reason.  We 

18

can still use that to go into district court and the 

19

district court could still do its job. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh.  So your 
But you say you can't use 

22

it in this case.  You say that that factor renders 

23

the  the giving of reasons inadequate. 

24
25

 MR. FISHER: 

No, Justice Scalia, it's not 

just the multiplicity of people on the board stating

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

different things.  It's the fact that we don't know 

2

whether those statements constitute reasons.  And this 

3

is one thing I really would love to give you a couple of 

4

examples. 

5

 There are many problems, first of all, 

6

arising out of the first question whether or not what 

7

citizens and experts say can constitute reasons.  The 

8

Solicitor General says:  Well, there has to be a clear 

9

indication that the voting members agree with that. 

10

Well, what if somebody just says, that's a good point, 

11

we'll take it into consideration?  Or, thanks, you know, 

12

I'll  I'll think about that?  What about the fact that 

13

a member, him or herself, might say something with an 

14

equivocal tone.  For example, Dr. Price said:  I'm not 

15

sure how to assess property values here. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

17

 MR. FISHER: 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, doesn't that 
Does that count as a reason? 
All of these kinds of 

19

examples, don't they only suggest that a State or a 

20

locality would be well advised to write up a little 

21

paragraph that clearly states its reasons?  But, you 

22

know, if they want to take the risk that a district 

23

court is going to say, gosh, I just can't find the 

24

reasons in this record, it's all too muddled.  If they 

25

want to take that risk, what in the statute prevents it?

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 MR. FISHER: 

The nature of substantial 

evidence review, which has a limiting principle 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No.  But I mean, substantial 

4

evidence review requires reasons.  If they want to take 

5

the risk that their  that their minutes or their 

6

transcript will not allow the district court to do 

7

substantial evidence review, then, you know, they'll 

8

lose. 

9

 MR. FISHER: 

But, Justice Kagan, substantial 

10

evidence review requires them to defend only on their 

11

actual reasons.  And what the city wants to do is have a 

12

record of over a hundred pages where anything it can 

13

find a foothold in, the lawyers can come in and make an 

14

argument that that's why they denied something.  That 

15

not only frustrates process, but even, Justice Kennedy, 

16

to your question about Federalism, it starts to 

17

frustrate Federalism, because now Federal courts are 

18

deciding why local government  local governments 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I'm surprised that 

20

that you're willing to accept that there does not have 

21

to be a reason or a number of reasons that  that the 

22

city council agrees on, that, you know, seven members of 

23

the city council, each  each one of them has a 

24

different reason, and that's okay.  Do you think that 

25

that's what the statute means?

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, I'm not sure, Justice 

2

Kennedy  Justice Scalia.  It  you don't have to 

3

decide that in this case.  The Solicitor General 

4

reserves it in a footnote.  I'm not sure that just like 

5

this voting body can reach a decision without a single 

6

reason  you know, these local government boards I 

7

think are really acting in an adjudicatory posture here, 

8

so I wouldn't want to preclude that.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.  But one can interpret 

10

the statute as demanding that they have a reason.  Now, 

11

to be sure, that's contrary to normal legislative 

12

action.  Congress doesn't have to have a particular 

13

reason for a statute.  Every  every congressman can 

14

have a different reason, and it's still valid.  But I 

15

I would read this as saying the city needs to  when it 

16

denies, it has to have a reason for denying.  I don't 

17

I don't know how else you read it. 

18
19
20

 MR. FISHER: 

I certainly won't argue with 

that. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, then what's the 

21

disagreement?  I mean, what's the disagreement between 

22

you and the Solicitor General?  Justice Brandeis said 

23

years ago, which I thought was a great statement of law 

24

which doesn't ordinarily appear:  Before we can say 

25

whether an agency decision is right or wrong, we have to

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

understand what it means. 

2

 MR. FISHER: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Uhhuh. 
You get some piece of 

4

paper, you can't figure out what it means, well, then 

5

they'll send it back or they say no.  That's what judges 

6

do with administrative agencies all the time.  Your 

7

question says, do they have to have reasons?  Yeah. 

8

Their question says can it appear in a separate 

9

document?  Why not, as long as the document is given 

10
11

about the same time?  So what's the problem? 
 MR. FISHER: 

The problem  we do agree with 

12

the Solicitor General, you need reasons.  We also agree 

13

with the Solicitor General that they need to be clear. 

14

Where we part ways with the Solicitor General is on the 

15

proposition that the ordinary administrative record can 

16

meet that clarity standard. 

17
18
19
20
21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Sometimes it could, 

sometimes it couldn't.  It depends on what it says. 
 MR. FISHER: 

Well, let me  let me just 

talk about the record in this case, Justice Breyer. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But that's the  I know. 

22

You want  that's what you really want to say.  You 

23

want to say the record here isn't good enough.  But it 

24

seems to me that the one thing we're not deciding is 

25

whether the record here is good enough.  Rather, the

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

questions have been put to us in general terms; we can 

2

answer them in general terms.  We probably even might be 

3

able to write an opinion in three paragraphs, clear. 

4

 MR. FISHER: 

What I want to use is the 

5

record here to be illustrative, Justice Breyer.  There's 

6

nothing unusual about this record in the sense that 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Ah, yes.  But to do that, I 

8

would have to know quite a lot, wouldn't I, about 

9

about the situation of your client, about the situation 

10

of the city council, about what was actually meant by 

11

what they said about the context.  You understand the 

12

problem. 

13

 MR. FISHER: 

Well, let me  let me just 

14

give you a few examples.  At JA 336, 338, and 340 are 

15

the parts of the minutes that the city and the Solicitor 

16

General rely on.  And they say things, for example, in 

17

equivocal ways, as I was describing.  We don't know 

18

whether that was a reason.  We also have a temporal 

19

problem that arises sometimes. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

As I understand the SG's 

21

position, the SG says there were five members of the 

22

council, three of them talked about the incompatibility 

23

of this tower with the neighborhood.  So what in that 

24

statement do you contest? 

25

 MR. FISHER: 

That statement is 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you think that three of 

2

them did not base this on the incompatibility of the 

3

fake tree with the neighborhood? 

4

 MR. FISHER: 

I'm not a hundred percent 

5

certain they did, because the motion, as is set forth in 

6

JA 340, comes after all of those statements.  There are 

7

many other statements, Justice Kagan.  One  one  one 

8

council member said:  I don't think cell towers should 

9

ever be able to be built in a residential neighborhood. 

10

Another asked whether TMobile could use different 

11

technology to establish the cell site. 

12

 So we don't know whether these statements, 

13

which also were right around the same time, also are 

14

things the city could defend on.  And I'm not sure the 

15

Solicitor General even has taken a position as to 

16

whether or not there are any other reasons in the 

17

record.  The Solicitor General has told us there's one 

18

thing we can consider. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

The Solicitor General only 

needs one. 
 MR. FISHER: 

Well, no.  They don't 

22

necessarily need one, Justice Kagan, because in the 

23

district court we're going to challenge for substantial 

24

evidence those reasons.  So it's going to be very 

25

important if in the district court we can show, as we

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think we can, that substantial evidence does not support 

2

the city's incompatibility argument.  Then the question 

3

is going to be is there another reason in the record, 

4

and we haven't  we have, perhaps, conflicting answers 

5

from the  from the other two lawyers in the room 

6

today. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, then you're going to 

8

reach the question that Justice Scalia had a view of, 

9

which was, you know, if two people think X and two 

10

people think Y and one person thinks Z, is that 

11

sufficient?  But as long as you have something that 

12

three people think, why isn't that sufficient? 

13

 MR. FISHER: 

It's not sufficient because we 

14

can't guarantee that that is why they voted.  These are 

15

statements that come before a vote.  And just like in 

16

this oral argument today, there's going to be many 

17

concerns and questions that precede the vote.  The vote 

18

may be for a different reason.  You don't know  I'd 

19

like to think that every answer I give today is going to 

20

assuage any question that I get, but that's not 

21

necessarily the case.  And it's not necessarily the case 

22

that something a local council person says for a round 

23

of applause in the room is exactly why they're going to 

24

vote 10 minutes later on the application. 

25

 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL 

Thank you, counsel. 

4

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE 

5

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

6

it please the Court: 

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 It's our position that a local government 

8

must provide reasons when it denies permission to 

9

construct a cell tower so that a court can conduct 

10

substantial evidence review as contemplated by the 

11

statute, but those reasons don't necessarily need to be 

12

included in the same document as the city's written 

13

denial of the application.  It's fine for the city to 

14

give its reasons in some other document like meeting 

15

minutes.  If the local government relies on a separate 

16

document, that document must be available at the time 

17

the written decision is issued. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Where does that come 

19

from?  There's nothing  Ms. O'Connell, there's nothing 

20

in the statute that says that the decision doesn't have 

21

to have the reasons, something has to have the reasons. 

22

It has to be, you say, fairly contemporaneous.  I don't 

23

see anything  you  you are inserting something into 

24

the statute that is not there. 

25

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

The  the primary reason

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

why we're saying it has to come out at the same time is 

2

because otherwise it would frustrate the judicial review 

3

provision, where the applicant has 30 days under the 

4

statute to decide what action to take based on the 

5

denial. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But wouldn't it more 

7

sensible, then, to take a suggestion that has been made 

8

that we run the 30 days from when reasons are given, run 

9

30 days from when the minutes are available?  I don't 

10

know why you have chosen a route that would say this 

11

applicant wins automatically, no hearing, no nothing. 

12

It doesn't matter that town's council had good reasons 

13

for it, they weren't contemporaneous, that's the end of 

14

it. 

15

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

I think one reason why, 

16

Justice Ginsburg, is because it's difficult to read the 

17

statute that way.  The 30 days runs from the final 

18

action of the local government, and the local government 

19

has to issue a decision in writing.  It would be 

20

difficult to say once you have a letter in hand that 

21

says, dear applicant, your application has been denied, 

22

that you don't have a written decision.  The applicant 

23

would be left to wonder whether reasons are coming at 

24

all, and if so, what those reasons are going to be.  And 

25

I think if you follow that to its logical conclusion,

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if  if you didn't have reasons and didn't know if they 

2

were coming, I guess what you would do, then, is wait 

3

150 days from the day you filed your application and 

4

then file a lawsuit saying, they didn't act on my 

5

application in a reasonable time, which seems not 

6

correct, given that they sent 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

How does it work in  in 

8

the ordinary agency, which I should know but I don't? 

9

The Federal Power Commission, a blessed memory, is faced 

10

with an application by El Paso Natural Gas to add an 

11

extension in a little area of New Mexico.  The power 

12

commission denies.  There are five votes.  One person 

13

says I'm denying because we don't need the gas; a second 

14

person says I'm denying because it's ugly; a third 

15

person says I'm denying because it blocks certain 

16

animals from getting to their feeding place; and the 

17

other two vote to grant, all right?  That's arisen in 

18

the course of the last 100 years, something like that. 

19

How do the courts handle that? 

20

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

In footnote 6 of our brief 

21

we describe some cases along those lines, where  I 

22

mean, in this case we think that you have a majority, 

23

three of five given the same reason 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But if  I just want to 

know how it works in the case I put.

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Right.  In  in the cases 

2

we describe in footnote 6, some courts have said and the 

3

D.C. Circuit did assume in one case that we cited that 

4

you need a majority, but other courts have said that 

5

it's okay as long as  if everybody gives a different 

6

rationale, as long as you can get to a majority; you can 

7

conduct substantial evidence review of each of those 

8

rationales.  And we think that makes sense here because 

9

the statute gives reasons why you can't deny an 

10

application.  It doesn't say there are only certain 

11

permissible reasons why you can't. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But doesn't the 

13

Administrative Procedure Act require providing reasons 

14

when  when there's a grant or a denial? 

15

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Yes.  And we agree that 

16

reasons are required.  The question Justice Breyer was 

17

asking was what if you don't have a majority in  in 

18

support of any particular rationale, and the response is 

19

we've cited some cases in footnote 6.

22

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24
25

Don't  don't you have to 

Yes, but 
So how can you give it 

if  if there is no majority for any single reason? 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

You would just  you would

26

Alderson Reporting Company

1

give the rationales of each individual council member. 

2

This is not  it's not a problem that's unique.

Has this Court ever held 

that?  Because I would never hold that. 

5

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

No, no.  It's not a 
It's absurd. 
Justice Scalia, we cited 

8

some cases in footnote 6 of our brief that indicate that 

9

other courts have allowed that to occur. 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm  I'm a little bit 

11

confused by that because  and this is what troubles me 

12

the most.  You get five council members, five different 

13

reasons.  At what point does he win, meaning if he 

14

proves that three of them were wrong in their reasons, 

15

so there wasn't a majority vote for anything?  That's 

16

what he has to do? 

17

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

There weren't a majority of 

18

council members that gave a reason that wasn't 

19

prohibited by the statute or was not supported by 

20

substantial evidence. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

That's a 
And it's not a problem 

23

that's unique to this particular context.  That comes up 

24

sometimes in agency decisions where there's a 

25

multimember body that's heading the agency.  The cases

27

Alderson Reporting Company

in footnote 6 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you want us to write an 

3

opinion that says under this Act agencies have to comply 

4

with SEC v. Chenery?  Or pardon me, city councils have 

5

to comply with SEC v. Chenery? 

6

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

We think that by requiring 

7

that decisions be in writing and supported by 

8

substantial evidence and then also by providing for 

9

judicial review of those decisions, implicit in the 

10

statute and explicit in the legislative history is that 

11

the local government has to give reasons. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Either under general laws 

13

of zoning or under any similar Federal statute, have we 

14

ever imposed  has the Federal Government ever imposed 

15

requirements like this on a legislative body? 

16

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

I don't think so, but it's 

17

not  I mean, we realize that this is a little bit of 

18

an anomaly in this statute, that normally a city council 

19

can do whatever it wants and it's not required to give 

20

reasons for its decisions unless it's 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is it just a legislative 

body? 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

No.  In this case, we think 

24

it's acting sort of as a 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.  I would  I would

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

consider this as an adjudicative body. 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Right.  It's  it's not 

3

making laws that would apply prospectively, but taking 

4

a  a specific ordinance that already exists and 

5

applying it to the facts of this case.  But in any 

6

event, that is the one thing that we think the statute 

7

does require local governments to do that could be 

8

different from its normal procedure, is to give reasons. 

9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you think that 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What does the  what 

11

does the Petitioner do with the one council member who 

12

didn't give reasons?  What does that person count as? 

13

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

So  so if he didn't give a 

14

reason, then I think you just don't count his  his 

15

vote toward the  the people that gave a rationale. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

What happens if 
It was four people who 

were there. 

19

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There were five. 
There were five.  One 

21

didn't speak, so you don't count his or her vote.  So 

22

it's a split vote. 

23

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Yes, but there were still 

24

three people that gave incompatibility with the 

25

neighborhood as their  as their reason.

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if  what if three 

2

people say, this is  this is incompatible with the 

3

neighborhood, and then later other  another member or 

4

other members provide other reasons, and those other 

5

reasons are either invalid under the statute or not 

6

supported by substantial evidence?  Under that 

7

circumstance, is it  can it be inferred that the final 

8

vote of those who previously expressed the view that 

9

this was bad for aesthetic reasons was the reason for 

10

their vote?  That seems to be Mr. Fisher's argument, and 

11

what's your answer to that? 

12

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

I think  I want to make 

13

clear that we're not saying that when you look through 

14

the written administrative record to determine what the 

15

reasons are, that you read through the whole transcript 

16

and that anything that came up during the hearing, like 

17

what happens when the power goes out or can't you make 

18

these things smaller or something like that is the 

19

reason why a particular council member voted, just as we 

20

wouldn't think questions at oral argument are your 

21

reasons for voting to affirm or reverse. 

22

 But in this case, you can pretty easily see 

23

that at the end of the hearing, the mayor said, okay, 

24

now, if everybody is finished giving their testimony, 

25

let's hear from the council, and they went down the line

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and everybody said what they thought about it.  It's 

2

those that we think are the reasons  that  each person has 

3

given. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. O'Connell, I think part 

5

of Mr. Fisher's arguments is that if everyone agrees 

6

that reasons have to be given, what sense does it make 

7

to require judges to scour the minutes and to scour the 

8

transcript and to try to make these judgment calls 

9

about, you know, when an individual council member has 

10

given a reason?  Why not at that point, once we're in 

11

the mode of requiring things, why not just require that 

12

the reasons be stated in the two or three sentences that 

13

the council or other body promulgates? 

14

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

It's not our position that 

15

such a requirement would be difficult to comply with. 

16

The reason we oppose it is because we don't think 

17

Congress went that far.  By requiring that decisions be 

18

supported by substantial evidence and providing for 

19

judicial review, we think Congress imposed a requirement 

20

that reasons be given.  But other than that, they have a 

21

savings clause that says that, other than what they 

22

specifically said, nothing else should interfere with 

23

the decisionmaking process of local governments.  And 

24

so if it's part of that decisionmaking process to 

25

normally talk about it at a meeting and give the

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decisions orally and then write up a summary that's 

2

written, then we don't think that the statute should 

3

be 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think Justice Kagan is 

5

not disagreeing with you.  She is saying, yes, reasons 

6

must be given.  And reasons  aren't  given if there's just 

7

this exchange in which a congressman  a councilman 

8

expresses a certain fondness for a particular view. 

9

What  what is the big deal of requiring either that 

10

the full council give its reasons or if you think it's 

11

enough that different councilmen have different reasons, 

12

each councilman say, I am voting against this for this 

13

reason?  What is the big deal about that? 

14
15
16

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

There is certainly not a big 

deal about it. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Especially since you're 

17

making the council do the same thing.  You're making 

18

them give reasons, right? 

19

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21
22

Right. 
So why not say you have to 

spell the reasons out? 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

I think the  that is part 

23

of substantial evidence review and part of Chenery, that 

24

the reasons have to be clear.  That's not part of our 

25

test.  It's inherent in substantial evidence review, and

32

Alderson Reporting Company

we do think the statement has to be sufficiently clear

to conduct substantial evidence review.

Roswell, its amicus, the Solicitor General, and the

Eleventh, Fourth, and Eighth Circuits all agree that

332(c)(7)(B)(iii) neither explicitly nor implicitly

The 30 days? 
I have  I have pondered

that because it is an issue in this case, but also, it's 

23

an issue going forward.  It's not really an issue in our 

24

case because the 30 days, when it ran, there had already 

25

been the approval of the minutes, the written denial had

33

Alderson Reporting Company

1

gone out, and the appeal was able to be timely.  There 

2

seems to be a split in the Federal circuits as to 

3

whether that should be 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  Was  was able 

5

to be timely, which means if all of that comes in 5 days 

6

before the deadline, it is still able to be timely?  I 

7

thought they were given 30 days to decide whether 

8

whether to go forward or not and you're saying it's 

9

enough if before the 30 days has totally expired, 

10

they  they can figure out what the city council 

11

decided. 

12

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Scalia, that is 

13

essentially correct, but what we are saying is we 

14

believe that the 30 days should run, as Justice Kagan 

15

suggested, from the approval of the minutes.  If you 

16

have the minutes approved 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, in this case  in 

18

this case, May 10th the minutes were approved, and May 

19

13th the suit was filed because the time ran out on May 

20

14th. 

21

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

23

That's correct. 
And you think that's 

sufficient? 

24

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

25

sufficient for this case.

I think it is only

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The 30day period is so 

2

there can be a carefully reasoned decision whether or 

3

not to file a suit.  Under your view, you have only 3 

4

days. 

5
6
7

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Kennedy, that 

that is what happened in this case.  That is not 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought you were taking 

8

the position, in answer to the government, that says you 

9

have to have it contemporaneous because of the 30 days 

10

that the company has to make up its mind whether to seek 

11

judicial review.  But I think you made the suggestion, 

12

which I then put to counsel, that just have the 30 days 

13

run from when the reasons are available.  So instead of 

14

having it run from when they send you a letter that says 

15

denied, treat that as not final until the reasons are 

16

given.  I thought that was your position. 

17

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Ginsburg, that is 

18

exactly what we're saying, and for three reasons.  One, 

19

the approval of the minutes  we've talked about 

20

substantial evidence, we've talked about the substantial 

21

evidence has to be affirmed by reasons given somewhere 

22

in the record.  The way to know what that is, it doesn't 

23

talk about a letter.  It talks about final action in 

24

(B)(iv) and, therefore, the final action of those 

25

minutes is the approval of those minutes.

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 Secondarily what that does is, when the 

2

minutes are approved, the applicant, if unsuccessful, 

3

has the opportunity to have 30 full days, knowing what's 

4

in the record, in order to file the appeal, and that 

5

dovetails with the recommendation of the Solicitor 

6

General about the contemporaneous minutes. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

10

Excuse me. 
Are you saying that 

the actual decision is the minutes 

11

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

So are you saying 

Yes. 
 as opposed to the 

letter you've sent? 

14

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

15

 The letter is a more or less, while the 

That is correct. 

16

Petitioner does not like this word, it is a 

17

notification.  It is a statement that it has been 

18

denied.  Why is that?  Because, as this Court has 

19

referred to it and other courts have referred to it, 

20

this whole telecommunications jurisprudence across the 

21

country is a patchwork, and in this particular instance, 

22

there are jurisdictions that don't require any 

23

notification, there are jurisdictions that require 

24

something be entered on the minutes, there are 

25

jurisdictions that require a letter, there are

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

jurisdictions that require a certified letter. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

In your view, if they had 

3

waited 60 days before they approved the minutes, then we 

4

wait until then for the time period to run? 

5

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

That is correct, Justice 

6

Kennedy.  The only  the only impediment to any of this 

7

is the shot clock, and I think that  and I think that 

8

if the 150 days starts to run, there's going to be a 

9

problem if the local government hasn't approved their 

10

minutes by that time.  That may well not give the 

11

applicant a record that does not have substantial 

12

evidence in it. 

13
14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

everyone loves cell phones, apparently. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

The facility placing 

Nobody likes towers, 

apparently. 

18

 (Laughter.) 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So Congress passes a law. 

20

It says:  You've got to have towers, I'm sorry, and the 

21

local community can stop it, but they can't stop it for 

22

one of three substantive reasons; and in addition, they 

23

have to show that their decision was rational, which is 

24

done  or reasonable, which is done by having a record 

25

with substantial evidence.  That's what this means to 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

me. 
 Now, your clients and others aren't used to 

3

being agencies, but they're being treated like agencies 

4

and, therefore, the simplest thing is to read this two 

5

things together, just what Justice Kagan said, write the 

6

decision and give your reasons because otherwise there 

7

is no way to know whether there's substantial evidence 

8

or not.  It's in the same clause.  It's in the same 

9

phrase.  The words are right there.  It says "decision 

10

supported by substantial evidence."  I know  that's, I 

11

think, the basic argument. 

12

 The Solicitor General doesn't go that far, 

13

but if we don't have simplicity, we'll have 2 million 

14

different ways of going about this between different 

15

cities and counties. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So why couldn't the city 

17

council or this legislative body have waited until its 

18

official minutes and sent the letter that day with the 

19

minutes? 

20

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

That they could have, and I 

21

think that is what the Solicitor General is 

22

recommending.  That was certainly not the law at the 

23

time, but that that is  the way to have 

24

contemporaneous minutes is to have the writing be 

25

basically at the time that it's approved.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 One of the problems is  and one of the 

2

problems with this decision to deny a request is in 

3

order to state those reasons, it has to have the very 

4

minutes approved in order to look at it and say, these 

5

are the reasons. 

6

 Now, I would suggest to this Court that that 

7

will only start a new inquiry, and that is the minutes 

8

 excuse me, Justice Scalia. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand  I 

10

don't understand what you're saying, it requires a 

11

written decision.  Okay.  And the city council here 

12

issued a written decision to the phone company saying, 

13

we have decided to deny your request. 

14

 Now  and you're saying that is not a 

15

written decision, you have to wait until the minutes are 

16

written up.  So, what, were they lying when they said, 

17

we've decided? 

18

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

I think what I'm saying, 

19

Justice Scalia, is that the writing that is sent 

20

we've had a lot of verbiage in the briefs about what is 

21

a decision and how to characterize that decision and 

22

whether it has some sort of opinion to it or whether 

23

it's just, this is what we did.  The statute  in the 

24

 requires substantial evidence in a written record which 

25

necessitates reasons.  Those can only be ascertained by

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the official minutes. 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But then you're agreeing 

3

with your opponents, it seems to me .  You have the 

4

document, the document says "denied," and there it gives 

5

the reasons for denying so people can see if there's 

6

substantial evidence. 

7

 You're just saying it was the later 

8

document.  They're saying it was the earlier document. 

9

I don't know. 

10

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

12
13

Well, Justice Breyer 
But do you agree with them 

on that, that one document 
 MR. CAROTHERS: 

I don't agree with him on 

14

that, Justice Breyer.  But I agree with what you just 

15

stated, that the minutes, when approved, they have 

16

substantial 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I don't know if they 

18

should be called "the minutes."  I'm not an expert on 

19

that area of city government.  I don't know whether you 

20

want to call the document "minutes" or whether you want 

21

to call the document "written decision."  That seems to 

22

 be not before us, but what is before us is whether the 

23

decision has to have in it the reasons so that we can 

24

tell if it's supported by substantial evidence.  You 

25

agree on that one?

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Again, I agree, Justice 

2

Breyer, as you have stated it.  I disagree that that 

3

particular decision is the one that is sent out right 

4

after the hearing, and in my proposal it wouldn't be 

5

sent right after the hearing.  It would be sent after 

6

the minutes,  so you would have the collective record 

7

which is referred to by the Eleventh Circuit, which 

8

could be 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that endorses more 

10

or less the SG's position.  What you're saying, I think, 

11

in answer to the question presented, the written denial 

12

doesn't have to itself as a document, provide the 

13

reasons, but when it's sent it has to have attached to 

14

it, referenced, something that is available telling you 

15

the reasons. 

16

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Well, and I'm not sure it 

17

has to tell the reasons if it attaches that, because the 

18

reasons will be in there and it'll be up to 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

 MR. CAROTHERS:

22

Something that 
 the district court to 

either ascertain, glean, clearly indicate 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And it's ineffective unless 

23

that exists.  So that what was given here in writing was 

24

not a decision, but what?  A we intend to decide when 

25

the minutes are finally written?  A prediction?  What

41

1

was it then 

2

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 that the phone company 

got? 

5
6

I would characterize 

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

 it as a notification of 

the denial, but the specific 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It hasn't been denied yet. 

8

You're saying it's not denied until the minutes are 

9

written 

10

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

I would 
 which is, you know, God 

knows when. 

13

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Well, it has to be done with 

14

the minutes, and you've got the shot clock running, but 

15

you can't have  you can't make the applicants 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you shouldn't send 

17

anything out then because according to you, there has 

18

been no decision.  You shouldn't send out a notice that 

19

we've decided. 

20
21

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Scalia, that is our recommendation 

22
23
24
25

Going forward, Justice 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's what you ought to 

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

 and I think that if you 

do. 

adopt, as Omnipoint has and Helcher and some other

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Federal cases, that, in fact, it should be the approval 

2

of the minutes, then I think that whole issue goes away. 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But it sounds like you're 

4

changing your position.  Page 34 of the red brief, that 

5

given the plain wording of the statute, whether a 

6

document from a  the question is, whether a document 

7

from a State or local government stating the application 

8

has been denied but providing no reasons can satisfy the 

9

statutory requirement.  And the simple straightforward 

10

answer is yes. 

11

 So now you're changing your position. 

12

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Kennedy, I don't 

13

believe I am stating the position.  What we're saying is 

14

it satisfies that portion of the statute.  It doesn't 

15

satisfy the substantial evidence in the written record 

16

which has got to be  which we contend, separated by 

17

the word "and," the conjunctive, that is a separate 

18

requirement.  And one of the things I think that I want 

19

to  the point I want to make is 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But where  but surely, 

21

under your view  I'm not convinced that your position 

22

hasn't radically changed  but surely under your view, 

23

what you've explained to us at page 34, the 30 days 

24

begins to run the minute the notice is given. 

25

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Kennedy, again, I

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think when we use words like "notice" and "decision," 

2

the letter  or the statute says, "Decision in writing 

3

of the denial."  That doesn't mean that is elevated to a 

4

decision by this Court or a decision by a lower court 

5

that has all of the findings and conclusions and the 

6

reasons, because the reasons are going to come from the 

7

minutes, and that's why we're advocating that the 

8

minutes be the start of the 30day period, and there can 

9

be a confluence of the letter 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could you 
That may be what the  what 

12

the statute means in light of the practicalities of the 

13

situation.  Now, since it talks about substantial 

14

evidence review, there's an argument that a 

15

municipality, when it makes a decision like this, should 

16

be treated pretty much like a Federal administrative 

17

agency.  But on the other hand, municipalities are 

18

sometimes very small.  These  these bodies are 

19

consist of lay people who are not learned in the law, 

20

they may not have attorneys available to them who are 

21

very knowledgeable about Federal telecommunications law. 

22

 So can you say something about that 

23

situation?  Is any of that true with respect to  to 

24

Roswell?  And what do you think Congress may have had in 

25

mind in a situation with respect to the treatment of

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

local governing bodies like Federal administrative 

2

agencies? 

3
4
5

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Well, Justice Alito, that is 

a multitiered question.  Let me see if I can answer it. 
 Number one, the amicus brief that was filed 

6

on behalf of the City of Roswell basically lays out the 

7

fact that you are exactly correct, there are lots of 

8

municipalities and local governments throughout this 

9

country that have trouble dealing with a pretty 

10

sophisticated Federal statute.  The City of Roswell has 

11

a relative degree of sophistication, it has attorneys, 

12

and it has planners and can do that. 

13

 But no court has ever held, including this 

14

Court, that the Chenerytype analysis for what needs to 

15

be an administrative decision has an application to a 

16

local government.  If you look, for instance, that 

17

that  there is lots of argument from Petitioner that 

18

there's something wrong with what Roswell did.  And if 

19

you just look at, specifically, they had evidence in the 

20

record, they had people who said this, this, this, this, 

21

and this.  You had four council members, three of whom 

22

said aesthetics, not right for the area, diminution of 

23

property value, and the other one 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Carothers, I wonder 

whether what Justice Alito pointed out about the nature

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of local governments, which you agreed with, whether 

2

that doesn't suggest that we should try to keep our rule 

3

quite simple.  In other words, given that nobody in 

4

small local governments has access to great lawyers or 

5

knows a lot about communication, that we should just set 

6

up a rule that enables them to comply simply. 

7

 And that rule, honestly, would be 

8

Mr. Fisher's rule.  It would just say, in your decision, 

9

write a sentence or two saying why.  Because otherwise, 

10

if we don't have that rule and every judge has to look 

11

through the minutes and the transcript and anything else 

12

in the record to decide whether a reason is clear 

13

enough, there are going to be a lot of local governments 

14

that are going to get kind of caught, and the judge is 

15

going to say, I'm sorry, it's not clear enough, even 

16

though if the government had spent just five minutes, it 

17

could have made it clear enough.  And maybe we should 

18

just say, do that so that you don't get caught. 

19

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Well, Justice Kagan, I  I 

20

don't object to that as long as the minutes are the 

21

final decision and so the 30 days can run from there. 

22

But then you're going to have that decision that's not 

23

going to come out for a couple months until the city 

24

attorneys and the planners have time to digest the 

25

decision of the record in orders to formulate that.

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And I will suggest to the Court that if, in 

2

fact, that occurs, it starts the process over because 

3

then the challenge is going to be the statements in the 

4

letter do not accurately reflect the minutes, they 

5

misstate the minutes, they mischaracterize the minutes. 

6

In fact, they're a post hoc rationalization of what was 

7

in the minutes.  We are going to have yet another line 

8

of inquiry and challenge which could be avoided if we 

9

simply waited for the letter and approve the minutes 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So that inquiry and 

11

challenge will be left up to judges to figure out what 

12

the minutes say, don't say, and what the reasons were. 

13

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

14

as  as I read the jurisprudence, the fact is the 

15

substantial evidence in a written record and to see the 

16

reasons is pretty much left up to the district court. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  Let's go 

18

back to, we had five members here.  One didn't talk.  Do 

19

you agree we don't count that person? 

20

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Correct. 
All right.  Now, do we 

22

need a majority rule, a majority of the council people 

23

giving a reason? 

24
25

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

I don't believe that is the 

case, Justice Sotomayor, and I will say it because of

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this.  It could be, but let's leave that situation.  The 

2

situation we have here was we had three persons of a 

3

pretty like mind, the aesthetics, the land use, the 

4

diminution of property values, that made a determination 

5

and said, we  we think that these are real bad.  Then 

6

you have a pretty long motion by Dr. Price 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, they said that before 

8

the vote.  We don't know why they voted.  What  what's 

9

the big deal of having a city council say, we deny this 

10

request for the following reasons:  One, two, three? 

11

That would be very clear; there'd be no problem at all. 

12

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Scalia, I think that 

13

is exactly what happened in that  in this case by the 

14

majority vote on Dr. Price's motion.  Now, I will 

15

concede to you that the council members did not stand 

16

and say I'm voting for Dr. Price's motion because of 

17

this, this, and this. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, suppose we issue an 

19

opinion in this case that says that the  the formal 

20

instrument of denial must say in simple terms the reason 

21

or reasons for the denial.  All right?  Let's say we 

22

issue that opinion, and six months later something like 

23

this comes up in some rural municipality.  Let's say 

24

they've got 1,000 people.  And how likely is it that the 

25

members of the governing body there, or their attorney,

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if they have an attorney, will be familiar with our 

2

decision in TMobile South v. City of Roswell? 

3

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Well, I don't know the 

4

answer to that exactly, Justice Alito, but I will say 

5

that whatever the decision is in this case 

6
7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

everybody in the country hangs on our every word. 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

10
11

You know, I know that 

And they're all going to 

read this opinion. 
 MR. CAROTHERS: 

What everybody in the 

12

country has, Justice Alito, is they have people knocking 

13

at the door to put up cell towers.  So this is a topic 

14

that many, many cities are attuned to. 

15

 But what I am attempting to say and urge the 

16

Court is to adopt, I think, all of the concerns the 

17

Court raises.  If the 30 days runs from the approval of 

18

the minutes, then you have the opportunity to have a 

19

writing 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Please articulate your 

21

rule, because you just said to us earlier that not every 

22

body of this type has  has minutes, or minutes that 

23

become the statement of reasons.  So what's the rule, a 

24

general rule about what's the final decision and when 

25

the time starts to run, assuming 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Sotomayor, what I 

2

would  what I would craft and  and what I believe to 

3

be the appropriate rule is the denial letter simply says 

4

denied.  That's what the statute says.  It doesn't 

5

require any reasons.  It could have required reasons. 

6

So put that issue aside.  And then that the approval of 

7

the minutes be the final action that triggers the 

8

running of the 30 days. 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How does that rule 

10

now we're forcing minutes on every  on every city 

11

council to have contained the statement of reasons? 

12

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Sotomayor, I don't 

13

know how to answer that.  I don't know of a jurisdiction 

14

that does not have some form of minutes or ratification 

15

of the previous actions and discussions they've taken, 

16

which are generally approved at the next meeting. 

17

 I think, in fact, if they're going to have 

18

substantial evidence in the written record, whenever 

19

those minutes are approved, they had better get into 

20

doing minutes because that is what's going to be 

21

required. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why  why do we have to 

23

say?  Why don't we take word for word almost what the 

24

what the court said?  What this statute requires is that 

25

there be a written denial  well, we can forget whether

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's separate or not  describing the reasons for the 

2

denial and containing a sufficient explanation to permit 

3

the court to evaluate the evidence, period. 

4

 Now, that's what the city has to do. 

And if 

5

they produce something that's a mess because it's a 

6

98page thing of minutes and the court can't figure out 

7

what it is, you'll get a decision like this.  If, in 

8

fact, somebody summarizes at the beginning, these are 

9

the reasons that we have denied and therefore we do deny 

10
11

it, it won't be a problem. 
 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Well, Justice Breyer, I 

12

simply would argue that the minutes have to have 

13

substantial evidence, which is  or have to have the 

14

reasons, which is supported by the substantial evidence. 

15

And if the court can't discern what those are, they're 

16

not going to survive the substantial evidence test. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Counsel, you  you spoke 

18

of the  the statutory requirement of a denial letter. 

19

Where  where is that? 

20

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Scalia, the  the 

21

statute indicates that in (B)(iii), any decision by a 

22

state or local government or instrumentality therefore 

23

to deny a request 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Right. 
 shall be in writing.

51

2

That is what I referred to as the denial letter. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's not the denial 

3

letter.  That's what you're referring to as the minutes. 

4

You say it's the minutes that comply with that. 

5
6

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

No, Your  Your Honor, I am 

saying that the minutes do comply with this 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, and constitute it. 

8

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

But a simple notification 

9
10

letter of the denial does not comply with it. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There's no requirement of a 

11

notification letter, whatever.  There's just that 

12

provision that any decision shall be in writing and 

13

supported by substantial evidence.  So why are you 

14

imposing this obligation of a denial letter on these 

15

poor, ignorant council members? 

16

 (Laughter.) 

17

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Your Honor, I am not trying 

18

to impose that on them, but we  I think we have to 

19

take the statute as it's written.  We have to have some 

20

meaning to what that is. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm taking it as it's 

22

written.  You're making up a denial letter.  There's 

23

there's no requirement of a denial letter.  So if, 

24

indeed, the decision is the minutes, you  you don't 

25

have to do anything until the minutes are published.

52

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

And I 
I suppose you have to give 

a copy of the minutes to  to  to the loser. 

4

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

5

 And, Justice Scalia, to the extent we're 

That  that is correct. 

6

talking about the same thing, I believe that the 

7

decision from when the time should run is, in fact, that 

8

approval of the minutes, which has the reasons based 

9

upon the substantial record.  I don't see that that, 

10

whether it's a denial, whether it's a notification, 

11

whatever it is, it doesn't have to have reasons.  So 

12

really, it doesn't help the applicant and doesn't help 

13

the city, but we're trying to give the words in the 

14

statute some effect.  We do not want to give them the 

15

effect that it is a decision and glorify something 

16

because a decision can be no. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Everybody else like you 

18

thinks that there has to be a denial letter, right? 

19

Is  is that a unique perception that  that you have 

20

come to, or is it generally thought that you have to 

21

have a denial letter? 

22

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

I think  I think there is 

23

a perception, because of what the statute says, that 

24

there has to be a denial letter, but it doesn't have to 

25

have reasons.  And if you don't have the reasons in the

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

denial letter, you  it's not fair to the applicant to 

2

start the appeal time running for the 30 days. 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

4

in the district court? 

5

Did you take that position 

 MR. CAROTHERS: 

Justice Kennedy, I'm 

6

struggling to answer that question because we didn't get 

7

very far in the district court.  We never really got a 

8

chance to talk about substantial evidence because the 

9

court decided:  I'm not going to reach that prong of 

10

(B)(iii); I'm going to say that I can't understand 

11

excuse me.  Thank you very much. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

 Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining. 

14
15
16

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. FISHER: 

Thank you.  I would like to 

17

make a point about our rule and then turn to the 

18

practicalities. 

19

 First, to  to  I think that what came 

20

before me helped under  helped explain why a separate 

21

letter specifying the reasons for denial is not only 

22

required by the statute, but is the only way to make it 

23

work. 

24
25

 If you look at the minutes that the city 
issued here, and they're in the back of the Joint

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Appendix  remember, as I think it's been noted, cities 

2

don't have to issue minutes, and so you're not always 

3

going to have minutes.  But on the theory that the 

4

minutes here would have been enough, look at the 

5

minutes, and if you want to look later at J.A. 338, 

6

J.A. 336, and J.A. 340, there are some of the reasons, 

7

as the Solicitor General put it, potential reasons, 

8

offered by various council members before the vote. 

9

 But if you look at J.A. 340, you'll see that 

10

all of those are separated from the motion, so the 

11

motion doesn't incorporate any of the reasons, not even 

12

what Dr. Price said before she made her motion. 

13

 So imagine yourself a district judge getting 

14

this set of minutes.  You don't know what the city's 

15

reasons were for denying the permit, and that's the 

16

problem that TMobile has and that's the problem the 

17

district judges  have. 

18

 And I want to turn to Justice Alito's 

19

question  and, Justice Kennedy, I think you also asked 

20

about the Federalism implications for local governments. 

21

 First of all, let me start with the City of 

22

Roswell.  The City of Roswell's own code, and this is at 

23

J.A. 84, requires it to give a separate document with 

24

reasons if it denies an application to construct a cell 

25

site on cityowned property.  All we're asking the city

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to do is do what it already does with respect to 

2

applications for cityowned property. 

3

 Now, you also point out there are rural 

4

areas in the country that have smaller staffs and 

5

jurisdictions.  At  at page 13 of our reply brief we 

6

cite statutes from other States like New Hampshire, 

7

Nevada, Idaho, that already have as a matter of State 

8

law the rule that we pronounce  I'm sorry, the rule 

9

that we propose.  The rural jurisdictions in those 

10

States don't seem to have difficulty doing it, and I 

11

think the reason why is because, as has been said a few 

12

times today, it just requires a few sentences usually. 

13

Just tell us what the reasons are and tell the district 

14

court what the reasons are, so that when we get into 

15

court we can have the streamlined proceeding that 

16

Congress imagined, and that it can be done, as the 

17

statute itself requires, on an expedited basis. 

18

 That's all we're asking for today, and we 

19

think that any other rule is going to create problems at 

20

the lower  I'm sorry, before you ever get to court and 

21

even more problems once we get to court. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Fisher, suppose that I 

23

think that you're right about that, but then the 

24

question is did Congress require that.  And I take it 

25

that the SG is really saying, no, Congress required

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasons, it required that by saying that there was 

2

substantial evidence review, but that it didn't require 

3

the reasons to be in any particular form, and, indeed, 

4

there's a savings clause which says that all doubts go 

5

to the State and local governments in this area.  So 

6

notwithstanding that this is going to actually get State 

7

and local governments into some trouble, and 

8

notwithstanding that district courts are going to 

9

struggle with it, we should go with the SG's rule rather 

10
11
12

than with yours. 
 MR. FISHER: 

We think the best reading of 

sub (iii) is that Congress actually did require this. 

13

 As the city itself pointed out, it separates 

14

the notion of a decision in writing from whether it has 

15

substantial evidence in the record that supports it.  So 

16

when you ask what the decision in writing is, you 

17

need  we think the best reading of that is that's the 

18

reasons.  The reasons have to be supported by 

19

substantial evidence, and you can't ask the substantial 

20

evidence question until you know what the reasons are. 

21

 And I think also, for the other reasons that 

22

we've pointed out and the Chamber of Commerce pointed 

23

out, how the Communications Act uses the word "decision" 

24

in a particular way.  It uses the word "decision" in 

25

other statutes to signify that an explanation is  is

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

something embedded in that, not as  as  as is often 

2

the case, and the city itself characterized the denial 

3

letter today, I think aptly, as a notification. 

4

 Well, the Communications Act uses the words 

5

"notify" and "notification" to refer to other kinds of 

6

advisements that need to be given.  That's not the word 

7

Congress chose here. 

8
9

 So, Justice Kagan, I agree, but if you look 
at this statute you might wonder to yourself if you 

10

misread the words in a vacuum which are  which rule 

11

comes out of it, ours or the SG's. 

12

 But we know from City of Arlington, as this 

13

Court said, that the limitations in sub (iii) are 

14

limitations that Congress did intend to impose and the 

15

best reading of those limitations are the ones that we 

16

have given. 

17
18
