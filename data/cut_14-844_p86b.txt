 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

 Mr. Shelley.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY F. SHELLEY

7
8
9

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 MR. SHELLEY: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

 There are at least three reasons why the

11

Court should adopt what the courts of appeals have

12

called the perprisoner approach under PLRA

13

Section 1915(b)(2).

14
15
16

 One, the perprisoner approach best comports
with the statutory text.
 Two, the perprisoner approach is the only

17

one consistent with the careful balance Congress struck

18

between deterring frivolous prisoner lawsuits and

19

preserving their right to bring meritorious ones.

20

 And three, the perprisoner approach avoids

21

anomalies and disincentives that Congress could never

22

have intended, disincentives such as discouraging

23

prisoner work by taking one hundred percent of their

24

income month after month.

25

 I would like to, of course, start with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

4
1

text.  The key sentence is in  the key sentence is the

2

second sentence of Subsection (b)(2).  It says the

3

following:  "The agency having custody of the prisoner

4

shall forward payments from the prisoner's account to

5

the clerk of the court"  singular  "each time the

6

amount in the account exceeds $10 until the filing

7

fees"  plural  "are paid."

8
9

 The combination of that singular, clerk of
the court, and filing fees, plural, indicates the

10

perprisoner approach because it means one clerk is to

11

receive payments, even when there are numerous filing

12

fees.

13

 Filing fees, the plural, appears in the 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

 MR. SHELLEY: 

16
17
18
19

There  there 
 in the statute exactly

twice.
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Can't there be more than

one filing fee for a single court?
 MR. SHELLEY: 

No, there cannot, not in the

20

way Congress understood the term in the PLRA.  If you

21

look to (b)(1) and (b)(3), Congress creates it almost as

22

a term of art.  A filing fee includes  a filing fee,

23

with the word "filing" in front of "fee," a filing fee

24

includes all of the subsidiary costs to start up a case.

25

 So a court of appeals, for instance, has a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

5
1

$500 docketing fee and a $5 statutory fee, and that's

2

referred to as a 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So what happens if you

4

have  the district court makes an order, there has to

5

be a filing fee?

6

 MR. SHELLEY: 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

In the district court?
Yes, and then that fee is

8

not totally paid.  In fact, the prisoner loses, so

9

there's a cost award in addition.  And then it goes up

10

to the court of appeals, where there's another filing

11

fee.

12

 MR. SHELLEY: 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Right.
Does  does  on your

14

reading, does the court of appeals filing fee also have

15

to wait until the district court filing fee is fully

16

paid?

17

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Yes.  There would be an

18

initial partial filing fee that's paid upon the  the

19

filing of the appeal.  Under Subsection (b)(1) there's a

20

20 percent initial partial filing fee that would be

21

assessed against the prisoner.

22
23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And that would be across

the board that you always have to pay.

24

 MR. SHELLEY: 

25

 But the second filing fee, the one from the

Always have to pay that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

6
1

court of appeals, would line up.  So the first filing

2

fee from the district court would be paid off first, and

3

then sequentially the court of appeals would be paid

4

off, but only 20 percent would be taken every month from

5

the prisoner.  You wouldn't take 40 percent.

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If he files enough cases,

7

he's never going to have to pay for it, right?  I mean,

8

you know, he files 20 cases, that 20 percent will

9

never  will never come home to roost.

10
11
12

 What  what's the disincentive for him 
for his continuing to file cases?
 MR. SHELLEY: 

Well, first of all, it would

13

come to roost back in 1995 when Congress enacted the

14

statute because the filing fee for a district court case

15

was only $120, and a court of appeals was 105.  And so a

16

prisoner who earned, say, 55 or 100  50 or $100 a

17

month, which is not outlandish given the small wages,

18

could pay off a filing fee in a  in a matter of months

19

under that.  It's much higher now.

20

 But to get to the rest of your question,

21

Justice Scalia, there are a number of other things in

22

the statute that work in tandem with (b)(2) to stop that

23

kind of behavior.  So there's the initial partial filing

24

fee.  He or she is always going to have to pay that.

25

There's the threestrikes rule, which comes into being.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

7
1

There's the ability of the district court or court of

2

appeals to sui sponte dismiss under the PLRA those cases

3

that are frivolous.

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All right.  So  so you

5

say there are disincentives, but this was intended to be

6

a disincentive.  Was this not intended to be a

7

disincentive?

8

 MR. SHELLEY: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It was and it is.
I'm pointing out that it's

10

a very ineffective disincentive if the person keeps

11

filing a lot of cases.

12

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Well, it's not an ineffective

13

disincentive because it creates months and months more

14

of additional income being garnished.  So it lines up

15

with the others.  None of them were anticipated to be

16

wholly barriers to filing a lawsuit.  And this one, as

17

with the others, creates a whole scheme where there are

18

added disincentives.

19

 But Congress also wanted to make sure the

20

meritorious cases would be brought.  And so it didn't

21

want to be overwhelming and put  and put the thumb too

22

much on the scale to kill all of those cases.

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Shelley, can we go back

24

to the sentence that you're relying on, because I have

25

to admit I don't understand your reading.  The  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

8
1

sentence says  and I'm taking out some unnecessary

2

words.  It says, the agency shall forward payments to

3

the clerk, singular, until the filing fees are paid.

4

 Now, that makes perfect sense if the filing

5

fees are all in one case, going to a single clerk.  But

6

if you're right and what they mean is the filing fees

7

are in multiple cases, then it doesn't make sense to say

8

that the agency shall forward payments to the clerk.

9

The only way to make that sentence makes sense, if the

10

filing fees are in multiple cases, is for Congress  is

11

for the statute to have read, the agency shall forward

12

payments to many clerks or to several clerks seriatim.

13

And that suggests not the perprisoner approach, but the

14

percase approach.

15

 MR. SHELLEY: 

I think that's incorrect

16

because I think what  what you should insert, if  if

17

necessary, in front of the clerk of the court is the

18

relevant clerk of the court.  So the prison officials

19

are going to distribute to the relevant clerk of the

20

court.

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But then  so that  that

22

seems right, to make the sentence work the way you want

23

it to work  and this is the sentence you are relying

24

on.  To make it work the way you want it to work, you

25

have to add language to it.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

9
1

 MR. SHELLEY: 

You  you do not, because

2

there's still  there's one clerk of the court, and

3

there's always going to be a clerk, because every case

4

the filing fee is paid to a clerk; so there's always

5

going to be the clerk of the court.  And  and in most

6

cases  in  in all cases, there's only one filing.

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, I'm going to say, you

8

know what, even as I look at that, even if you add that

9

language, it still doesn't make sense.  "The agency

10

shall forward payment to the relevant clerk until

11

multiple filing fees are paid."  It's just  it

12

doesn't  the two halves of the sentence don't connect

13

there.

14

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Well, the filing fee's plural.

15

It  it can't allow for the  for the percase

16

approach, the opposite approach, because filing fees we

17

know means more than one.  And so it has to mean more

18

than one, because in (b)(1) and (b)(3) Congress used

19

this term of art to mean filing fee encompasses.  It's

20

the thing that comprises all of the other fees.

21

 And so I would say that the opposite side is

22

the one that cannot make any textual sense out of that

23

sentence, because there's never more than one filing fee

24

from a  to a single clerk.

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but Congress doesn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

10
1

know that.  Congress thinks fees in a case, fees in a

2

case.  So then it makes perfect sense.  Give the fees in

3

a case to the clerk.  But you're saying give fees in

4

multiple cases to the clerk, when it's not.  It's give

5

fees to  in multiple cases to multiple clerks.

6

 MR. SHELLEY: 

It's give the fee to that

7

clerk that that clerk is owed until all the fees are

8

paid.  You keep going back to a clerk until all the fees

9

are paid.  So 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Isn't  isn't the

11

statute drafted, though, that with a singlecase focus,

12

that is, 1915 throughout, talks about an action?

13

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Not  not true.  First of

14

all, the whole purpose of the statute was to deal

15

with  with multiple filers.  So the whole  Congress

16

comes into it with a purpose of dealing with individuals

17

who file many cases.

18

 But second of all, the threestrikes rule

19

assumes numerous cases.  And I'd also point to

20

Section 1915(d), which has the statutory language, "The

21

officers of the court shall issue and serve all process

22

and perform all duties in such cases."

23

 So there are references to more than one

24

case in various plays.  But even if it was written in a

25

singular way, in a way to deal only with one case, that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

11
1

really doesn't prove anything against us.  It just means

2

you got to look to other statutory construction tools,

3

because it would just say that there's going to be an

4

initial partial filing fee in every case.  And there

5

needs to be installment payments in every case.

6

 And we don't disagree with that. 

We agree

7

that there are installment payments in every case, and

8

it's just a matter of when.  And the statute doesn't

9

answer when, necessarily, right off the bat.

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But why is the initial

11

fee  the initial partial fee, you say each time you

12

file it, you've got to pay that?  Why shouldn't that go

13

the same way?

14

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Well, the  the two sections

15

are written differently.  (b)(1) is very different from

16

(b)(2).  It's a different collector.  One is the prison

17

official.  The other is the clerk of the court.  One

18

mentions filing fees, plural.  The other only mentions

19

filing fee, singular.  There's a $10 rule in the

20

second  in the second  in (b)(2) but not in (b)(1).

21

So they  they are a little bit different.

22

 But even if 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If you don't know  I

24

mean, I can't get anything out of the second sentence,

25

to tell you the truth, because I think that a prison is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

12
1

usually within a single district.  And so when you're

2

worried about a multiple filer, what he does is he files

3

about 15 cases in the same court.

4

 And  and therefore, it's perfectly

5

understandable why Congress would refer to multiple

6

fees, because they are going to be like ten of them.

7

It's the people they are really worried about are  are

8

what's at issue.  So I can't get anything out of the

9

second sentence.

10

 It's the first sentence that  that is, it

11

seems to me, both your strength and your weakness.

12

There it talks about after payments of the  the

13

initial partial filing fee.  Okay.  It sounds as if it's

14

talking about a case.  And so what do we do about that?

15

I mean, there it is.  "After the initial partial filing

16

fee, the prisoner shall be required to make monthly

17

payments of 20 percent," et cetera.  That's where you

18

have the word "fee."

19

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Well, first of all, I don't

20

think Congress necessarily had in mind a prisoner who is

21

filing numerous cases in the same court, because if you

22

look up to (a)(2), for instance, it talks about the

23

prisoner having to file a statement of his indigency.

24

And Congress talked about it needed to be obtained from

25

the appropriate official of each prison at which the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

13
1
2

prisoner is or was confined.
 And the government concedes that prisoners

3

are moved around all the time, and therefore, there are

4

numerous districts 

5
6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 
exclusive.

7

 MR. SHELLEY: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

I don't mean it's

Sure.
I'm just giving you an

explanation as to why they might have used the words

10

"fees," even though they previously defined a filing fee

11

of $350.

12

 MR. SHELLEY: 

So then let's go to that first

13

sentence in  in the statutory text in

14

Subsection (b)(2).  We don't disagree that after a

15

partial filing fee is assessed, the installment payments

16

will also start to kick in.  It's just a matter of do

17

they line up or do they  or do they come first.

18

 So I don't think under that  I don't think

19

(b)  (b)(2) in that first sentence then would answer

20

the question.  It  under our theory, you also get a 

21

you also get an installment payment after the payment of

22

the initial partial filing fee.

23

 But 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

In terms of one of your

purposes, why isn't the government's concession that in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

14
1

no circumstance can a fee 20 percent be taken until 

2

unless it's above $10?  Why doesn't that take care of

3

your problem?

4

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Because I don't think the

5

government's position is  is statutory allowed.  So if

6

you take a situation where, let's say $11 was earned by

7

the prisoner the  the previous month, and that's all

8

that was in the account.  In that case you'd have to

9

take  under the statute, you meet the statutory terms.

10

There's $10 in  in the account, and you have to take

11

20 percent.  "Shall" is the word.  Shall take 20 percent

12

if there's over $10.  Well, there's $11 in there.  The

13

government say, we're not going to take the 20 percent

14

because it's going to send it under $10.  So that 

15

that can't work out.

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, what the

17

government  I understand  and they'll correct me 

18

is I think they are saying that if you pay a  the

19

initial filing fee, and you're down to $8, they can't

20

take another 10  another 20 percent.

21

 MR. SHELLEY: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23
24
25

Sure.  Well, that's 
That's how I understood

their concession.
 MR. SHELLEY: 

So that was their alternative

position.  But even that one won't hurt our purposes

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

15
1

argument, because if you take a prisoner who now, let's

2

say, he has $55 in income.  And that's not outlandish

3

because if you earn 35 cents an hour and you work a

4

40hour week, you have $55.  In that situation, the

5

first four encumbrances will take $11 each, $44, leaving

6

you at $11.  The last one is going to take the whole

7

amount, cause you have got a fifth encumbrance and

8

you're over $10.

9

 So under even this alternative approach, you

10

take 100 percent of the income every time the income is

11

more than $55.  Maybe I should go through that again.

12

 Okay. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So 
If you're clarifying it,

14

$11, I guess you'd take a dollar.  All right.  I mean,

15

what's unclear?

16
17
18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If you're at 55, you

take 10.
 MR. SHELLEY: 

The statute says 20 percent if

19

it exceeds $10.  So if you have $11 in there after

20

the  after the fourth one, you have to take the fifth

21

20 percent increment 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

They can't administer it

23

that way.  I mean, is there somebody who is

24

administering this that way?

25

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Every circuit who has looked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

16
1

at it has described the perprisoner approach as one

2

that as long as there's $10 in the account, it's the

3

trigger.  You can take the whole income.

4
5
6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And they are really doing

that?
 MR. SHELLEY: 

As far as I know, yes.  Well,

7

the BOP says it is not.  I understand the States, where

8

many of the prisoner are, are doing exactly that.  And

9

we showed two  we cited two district court cases where

10

they went over what the States were doing, and they

11

drain it down to zero.

12

 I mean, the Newlin case says you can drain

13

it down to zero.  Torres, Siluk.  In fact, that's why

14

they  they  the  the Second, Third, and Fourth

15

Circuits all got into this issue of  of the

16

constitutionality or the purposes because they said,

17

look, prisoners are going to be left with zero.

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's inconceivable to me.

19

I mean, what?  Is  is there a constitutional

20

requirement that prisoners be given income while they

21

are in prison?

22

 MR. SHELLEY: 

There isn't, I  I don't

23

think.  They are given the essentials, but the point of

24

it is, is that 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Especially if the fact that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

17
1

they don't have any is their own fault, if they keep

2

filing baseless suits.

3

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Well, but the  you'd be out

4

of  you wouldn't be filing baseless suits because you

5

got the three strikes, eventually.  But Mr. Bruce, for

6

instance, had  had six cases before he incurred his

7

first strike, even.  And so the  the constitutional

8

dimension that the Second, Third, and Fourth Circuits

9

have all adopted goes to the point of you can't put

10

the  the prisoner in the position of losing

11

100 percent of the income that he works to earn as  as

12

the Hobson's choice to filing what may be a meritorious

13

case.  They haven't said it's unconstitutional.  They've

14

just said the statute leaves you scratching your head.

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, it  it's not a

16

Hobson's choice if he forfeits all except $10.  That's

17

going to be the difference, whether he has $10 in his

18

account or nothing.

19

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Yes.  Yes.  And as this Court

20

has said, and as Congress said in 1892 when it enacted

21

the in forma pauperis statute, a man who has very little

22

cares about each penny.  And in prison if you have $6,

23

it makes a difference.  It makes a difference that month

24

than if you had zero.  It's a difference between 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Is there a way of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

18
1

interpreting the statute, which I think would make 

2

I  I would guess, not in every case, where this

3

multiple thing is likely to arise is where:  Files a

4

frivolous case, it's dismissed by the district court,

5

and then he takes an appeal.  Okay?  There we have two.

6

 And so the question is  he has to get the

7

filing fee.  Then the next slot is going to be, like,

8

20 percent or 40 percent, right?  But you should leave

9

him with $10.

10

 Given the purpose of the statute, which is

11

to stop these frivolous suits, or at least make it a

12

little tougher, doesn't it make sense, say, what I just

13

said:  Leave him with the $10, but you can take the

14

40 percent:  20 percent for one court, 20 percent for

15

the other?

16

 Now, maybe what I've just said doesn't make

17

sense.  To me, it makes sense at the moment.  But it

18

would  it would both leave him with the $10, but allow

19

the clerks to collect the 20 percent for the district

20

court, 20 percent for the Court of Appeals.

21

 Is  is that impossible to bring about?

22

 MR. SHELLEY: 

I think it is, given the

23

statutory language.  I think, given the fact that the

24

prison officials shall forward payments each time the

25

amount in the account is greater than $10 doesn't allow

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

19
1

the prison official to say I'm going to use it as a

2

floor, as opposed to a trigger.

3

 And while that might have been the way

4

Congress could have written it, it did not.  And given

5

the way Congress did write it, the best approach is that

6

perprisoner approach that leaves some money to the

7

prisoner for things like phone calls.

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Actually, I  I didn't

realize the back end of this.  Forget about the
prisoner.  I'm thinking about the courts.
 Basically, you're saying the last court that

12

brings him over 10  the moment he has over $10, the

13

court who gives  no.  That doesn't happen.  The

14

court  he pays a filing fee.  He now has more than $10

15

in the account.  That court gets more money than the

16

other courts?

17

 MR. SHELLEY: 

No.  They all get  they all

18

get 20 percent.  The  the way it should work is, is

19

there $10 in the account?  If there's $10.01, you then

20

can take 20 percent, a 20 percent installment.  Perhaps

21

another 20 percent for cost; that's a different issue.

22

But you  for the filing fees you take a 20 percent

23

installment, and it goes down to, say, $8 at that point.

24

That's the end of it under the  under the perprisoner

25

approach that we espouse.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

20
1

 Under the percase approach, the way the

2

courts of appeals at least have understood it, if there

3

is $10.01 in the account and there are five filing fees,

4

that's 100 percent of the $10.01 that goes.  20 percent

5

for each.

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That wouldn't be true for

7

a Federal prisoner, because the Bureau of Prisons says

8

no matter what, the prisoner has to be left with $10.

9

 MR. SHELLEY: 

It's a matter of grace.  It's

10

not set out in regulation.  It's not set out in

11

guidance.  It's 

12
13
14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Do they know to the

extent to which the States are following that?
 MR. SHELLEY: 

Yes.  To the extent we've been

15

able to investigate that, we've cited two  two

16

district courts in our reply brief.  I think one from

17

Iowa and maybe one from another Midwest state 

18

Maryland and Iowa.  Those two cases, the  the way the

19

Court's decision reads, it indicates that they are

20

looking to see if there's $10.01, and then they're

21

taking  they're going down 20, 20, 20, and 20.

22

 And I would also note, if you look at Siluk,

23

the Third Circuit; Torres, the Fourth Circuit; and

24

Judge Easterbrook's decision in Newlin, they all talk

25

about if there's more than the $10, you take 100 percent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

21
1

if there's five filing fees.

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If  if 
Now, I don't see how

4

the Bureau of Prisons can do this as a matter of grace.

5

I mean, the statute says what it says, "shall."  I

6

don't  I don't know why think they can do  they may

7

have their own views on what's good policy, but

8

Congress, it seems to me, has written the statute

9

exactly the way you say.

10

 MR. SHELLEY: 

I agree.  I agree with that.

11

The only possibility is that alternative approach they

12

say, where they stop after the first one goes below $10.

13

But that one takes 100 percent of the income and helps

14

us in proving the perprisoner approach, because in most

15

cases, where there's any  any  any job or wage

16

income being earned by the prisoner, you're going to

17

take 100 percent because the last 20 percent increment

18

will be above the $10.

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You can interpret it the

20

other way, linguistically.  You say, you forward the

21

20 percent each time the amount in the account exceeds

22

$10.  Well, the instant you write that check, you say,

23

it  it does not exceed $10, and therefore you can't

24

forward it.  So you can't write that kind of a check.

25

 I mean, isn't that literally 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

22
1
2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
until they cash the check.

3

 MR. SHELLEY: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

Well, it exceeds $10

I would agree with that.
Well, now we're getting

into the technicalities of banking 

6

 (Laughter.)

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 which  so  so I 

8

I  I think you can read it the way I suggested, if

9

you're not too technical about it.  It seems consistent

10
11

with the language.
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Does the Fed have a

12

position on this that  that  that Chevron requires

13

us to defer to?

14

 MR. SHELLEY: 

No.  No Chevron deference

15

here.  There's no regulation.  There's no guidance.

16

It's a statement in an adversary brief.

17

 But, Justice Breyer, I think that there

18

are  there are a number of machinations that can be

19

go  that can be gone through in order to defend

20

this  this idea or that idea, and the government comes

21

up with alternative ones that they're not even using to

22

try to deal with the plural filing fees, for instance.

23

 But our approach is much simpler. 

Our

24

approach is you read the statute the way it  the way

25

it states a "shall."  You know, "shall the prisoner."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

23
1

 You don't look to see if it's  the payment's going to

2

be under $10 afterwards, but look to see if it's over as

3

a trigger and then pay.

4

 In addition, you don't have a lot of other

5

problems with our approach.  You just figure out which

6

one was first, which one was second, which one was

7

third.

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

this  this  Mr. Bruce had multiple filings, right?

10

 MR. SHELLEY: 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

12

What happens  I think

At this point, yes.
Yes.  It's something

like  how many?  17?

13

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

19.  But  but the first 
19.  So it is 

15

realistically, those later fees are never going to be

16

paid, because he's going to be released from prison

17

somewhere along that chain.

18

 MR. SHELLEY: 

First of all, Mr. Bruce didn't

19

incur  the last seven or so have not been filed,

20

essentially because he had had three strikes by the

21

12th.  So there's really only 12 lawsuits we're  we're

22

talking about that could have filing fees.

23

 But the answer to the question, Justice

24

Ginsburg, of whether he's never going to pay those,

25

again I would go back to 1995 and say Congress thought,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

24
1

well, they could be paid relatively quickly if the

2

filing fees were lower.

3

 But you  you touch on a question that is

4

unsettled in the lower courts, which is does the amount

5

come due at the end of when the prisoner  when the

6

prisoner sentence ends?  And the courts of appeals are

7

divided about that, with the Fifth Circuit saying, yes,

8

it does come due, and you have to come up with some kind

9

of a plan with each of the clerks to which you owe

10

money, and you shall pay it off.  Other circuits say it

11

is.  It does come due, but it only comes due and you

12

have to pay it if you're not in forma pauperis at the

13

time the government seeks to collect it after you're

14

out  out of release.

15

 So I don't think it's correct to say, at

16

least as a matter of law, it's settled as to whether

17

these filing fees forever go away once the prisoner 

18

prisoner leaves prison.

19

 I had also started just talking about the

20

difference  the different problems of the percase

21

approach that ours avoids.  And the, as I mentioned,

22

the  the perprisoner approach allows you to line up

23

the fees one after another.  You just have to figure out

24

which one was incurred first, second, third, fourth.

25

But under their approach, what happens after the fifth

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

25
1

one?  You have five.  Takes 100 percent of income.  And

2

at that point, well, the sixth one becomes our approach.

3

If you have six, seven, eight, it then becomes the 

4

the sequential approach that has all the problems they

5

say our 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought the

7

government's position was you can't get blood out of a

8

stone, so when it's 100 percent, that's it.  Sixth,

9

seventh, eighth, we'll just have to 

10

 MR. SHELLEY: 

They stood in line.  What 

11

the government says that  page 30 of their brief is

12

that that gets deferred.  Deferred until one of them

13

gets paid off.  So then you have to figure out, well,

14

one of them got paid off, so which one do you switch in,

15

and how much do you switch in?  And it just  the

16

problems start to multiply.

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why do you pick the

18

earliest?  I mean, all of them  all of them are owed.

19

Why don't you pick the nearest court?

20

 MR. SHELLEY: 

Well, you could.  You could

21

pick the nearest court; you could pick the last one, the

22

most  the most 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24

 MR. SHELLEY: 

25

 But the way the courts of appeals have

Right.
 the most current.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

26
1

looked at it, they've looked at, in time, the first.

2

 And I don't think the government disagrees

3

because, at least when you get to the sixth one, it's 

4

they  they treat that one as being deferred under

5

their approach, with the first five being paid.

6
7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
for the filing fees here?

8

 MR. SHELLEY: 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

10

Is he on the hook

 MR. SHELLEY: 

He is not.  He is not.
Why not?

I don't understand the Court

11

to apply the PLRA for its cert petitions, for instance.

12

And in any event, I believe his filing fee was paid

13

on  oh, he is  he is subject to a filing fee in this

14

case, and he did pay it.  But I don't understand the

15

Court to apply the PLRA to cert petitions.

16

 One last point I wanted to make is that I

17

think it is often thought that a prisoner who has 12

18

filing fees or 10 filing fees is a recidivist prisoner,

19

but that's not the case.

20

 As the  the Second Circuit noted in the

21

Whitfield case, that single case produced five

22

encumbrances.  It was a district court appeal, it was a

23

district court case, a Second Circuit appeal.  There

24

were two cost awards from the district court and the

25

court of appeals, and there was a second appeal.  There

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

27
1

were five encumbrances in one single piece of

2

litigation.  So these encumbrances can add up quite

3

quickly, and you can get up to five, seven, eight.

4

 And that case, it was a meritorious case,

5

the Second Circuit said.  It wasn't a frivolous case.

6

The prisoner didn't win, but it was  it was a case

7

that wasn't, as  as Justice Kagan used in the last

8

argument, it wasn't a laughingstock case.  These

9

were  it was a meritorious case in the sense that it

10

was one that could be brought by any other American that

11

the prisoner  that the prisoner brought.

12
13

 So I'd like to reserve the remainder of my
time for rebuttal.

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

15

 Ms. Saharsky.

16
17
18
19

Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

 This statute is written from the perspective

21

of a single case.  And what I mean by that is that for

22

each action or appeal, it provides a list of things for

23

the Court to do:  To check for the affidavit of

24

indigency, to check for three strikes, and as relevant

25

here, to require full payment of filing fees on an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

28
1
2

installment schedule.
 So what we're talking about here is

3

Subsection (b), which is the filing fees provision, and

4

it says, first, that an IFP prisoner has to pay the full

5

amount of each action or appeal, talking about a single

6

action or appeal, and then it sets out an installment

7

plan, which is an initial payment and a monthly payment.

8
9

 So we're at the point where Petitioner
agrees that the initial payment is for each case, but

10

the  he says that the statute somehow shifts

11

perspective to all of an inmate's cases when it starts

12

talking about the monthly payments.

13

 And we just don't think there's any kind of

14

clear explanation in the statute that does that.  We

15

think the burden should be really on him to show a shift

16

from a single case to all of the cases, and it wouldn't

17

make sense to do that.

18

 I think Justice Scalia made the point in

19

this discussion that there just wouldn't be any marginal

20

deterrence if an inmate could file as many lawsuits as

21

he wanted and not make any additional 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You say the word "fees."

What about the word "fees"?  Does that show?
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  What petitioner says

is that the word "fees," plural, always means more than

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

29
1

one case.  And we know from the text of this statute

2

that that's not true, because there are several places

3

where Congress says "fees" and it's referring to a

4

single case.

5

 So for example, in Subsection (b)(3),

6

Congress talks about the amount of fees permitted by

7

statute for a civil action or an appeal.  In (b)(1) it

8

talks about any court fees required by law for an action

9

or appeal.  Similarly, in (a)(1) and (a)(2) it talks

10

about fees, plural, for a  a single action or a single

11

appeal.

12

 And to be clear, we think that in this

13

statute Congress used "fee" and "fees" somewhat

14

interchangeably in the way that people do out in the

15

world; that people would say "attorney's fees," "an

16

attorney fee award," "fee shifting," "we're shifting all

17

the fees," that sort of thing, that that's just common

18

usage, and that the single/plural fees in

19

Subsection (b)(2) just does not provide the kind of

20

strong indication that would be necessary to overcome

21

the real thrust of the rest of the statute, which is

22

that it's something that a court does for each of these

23

cases.  It sets out this payment plan; it does each of

24

the other things that are set out in the statute.

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

Ms. Saharsky, I

Official  Subject to Final Review

30
1

don't  I can't  I'm not terribly persuaded by your

2

deterrence argument.  I mean, no statute pursues its

3

purposes at every cost.  And maybe Congress decided they

4

could  they didn't need to take the last 23 cents an

5

hour the prisoner earned to promote the deterrence when

6

they have all these other antifiling provisions in the

7

law.

8
9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, this is the only

provision that provides a financial deterrent.  There

10

are other provisions, like the threestrikes provisions,

11

et cetera.  But this is the one, and this is in the

12

record, where members of Congress said it makes an

13

inmate stop and think, is this lawsuit worth the cost.

14

 And in the amount that 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes, but Congress is

16

talking about, okay, they have to pay the filing fee.

17

Certainly Congress didn't focus, I wouldn't think, on

18

whether it's  well, I assume they didn't focus on

19

whether it's per case or per prisoner, because it's

20

really quite unclear.

21

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, we think that Congress

22

did make that decision when it wrote the  the statute

23

from a perspective of a single case.  Congress 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I wanted to talk

about that.  I  the first reading, two struck me as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

31
1

different than one, because in  in one you're talking

2

about, oh, this is what the Court should do.  But on two

3

you say this is what's required of the prisoner, and it

4

just says up to 20 percent.

5

 Now I know one says required two, but it

6

immediately shifts its  he's required to pay the whole

7

thing, and that's the important point.  But  but two,

8

it says this is what's required of the prisoner, monthly

9

payments of 20 percent of the preceding month's income.

10

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12
13

Right.  Towards 
To me that seems to

be more a prisoner focus than a casebycase.
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

But it's  it's linked to

14

Subsection (b)(1).  This whole thing is talking about

15

what happens in a  in a specific case.  It starts by

16

saying the  "When a civil action or an appeal is

17

filed, you shall pay the full amount of the filing fee,

18

and here's the way to do it."  And Subsection (b) then

19

triggers  Subsection (b)(1) then triggers

20

Subsection (b)(2).

21

 We think Judge Shreenavossen got this

22

exactly right in the opinion for the D.C. Circuit where

23

he said that when you start reading (b)(2), it is

24

triggered from (b)(1), and it continues the percase

25

focus that it's talking about, first we have an initial

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

32
1

partial payment for one case, and then we have monthly

2

payments to pay off the balance of that case.

3

 And that's 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm not sure that's

5

responsive to my point.  I guess what I was saying is I

6

don't think it carries forward the casebycase basis

7

because it speaks solely of what's required of the

8

prisoner in a way that doesn't address case by case at

9

all.  I mean, that's why this is such a confusing

10
11

statute.
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, we think  the reason

12

that we think it does, just to be clear as possible, is

13

because of the language that starts Subsection (b)(2),

14

which is, "After payment of the initial partial filing

15

fee"  which is for one case  "then the prisoner is

16

required to make monthly payments," which is to pay the

17

remaining amount because we know he has to pay the full

18

amount for one case.

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Of 20 percent of the

20

preceding month's income.  To me, I  well, I would

21

think at least as reasonable as you're reading, to say

22

when you look at what is required of the prisoner, 20

23

percent of his income, that doesn't have anything to do

24

case by case, because what you would require, of course,

25

is that he pay 40 percent if there are two cases, or 60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

33
1

percent if there are three, or all of it, if it's above

2

$10.  And I think he  anyone  someone looking at

3

that may say, no, he's only supposed to pay 20 percent

4

of his income.

5

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

But this  this part of the

6

statute, and all the parts of this statute, really, are

7

talking about the perspective of a single case.  And we

8

think the 20 percent makes sense in that regard, because

9

as one member of Congress said  and this was quoted in

10

the D.C. Circuit's opinion  the filing fee of  of 20

11

percent is small enough not to deter a prisoner with a

12

meritorious claim, but it's large enough to deter

13

frivolous claims or multiple filings.

14

 So the 20 percent essentially leaves room

15

for multiple filings that you could apply at more than

16

one time when a prisoner has a second case, a third

17

case, a 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, yes, but he

19

doesn't get off the hook for the other ones.  It's

20

just  has to pay it further down, you know, it's 

21

it's like a mortgage.  I mean, you get 30 years, you

22

have to pay it further down.  If you're on 15 years, you

23

have to pay it less.

24

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I think 

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, it's not

Official  Subject to Final Review

34
1
2

like he's getting off Scottfree.
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  I understand your

3

question, but I think that there are a couple of

4

problems with that.  One is that there's nothing in the

5

statute that suggests that you would delay the payments.

6

And it doesn't make sense in terms of the statutory

7

purpose to delay them.

8
9

 As Judge Easterbrook's opinion for the
Seventh Circuit said, if you want to have a

10

payasyougo system where there's an immediate cost to

11

each individual case, the person needs to have an

12

obligation to start paying right away, not five years in

13

the future, or perhaps never.

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

15

percent in every case right away.

16

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, he pays the 20

Right.  But that's a onetime

17

payment, and it could be quite small.  And that's very

18

different from having an ongoing monthly payment that

19

starts right away and that you have to pay.

20

 But I do want to address another  another

21

point that I think your question raised, which is are

22

prisoners ever going to be paying these amounts,

23

particularly where they have filed numerous cases like

24

the individual in this case.  And I think the answer is

25

no, for two reasons.  The first is a practical one.  The

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

35

second one is a legal one.

2

 I guess I'll start with the legal one that

3

numerous courts that have considered this issue have

4

said that once a prisoner is out in the world and is no

5

longer a prisoner but wants to continue his case, he can

6

try to qualify for regular IFP status and no longer have

7

to make his payments.  So potentially, he's not making

8

those payments.

9
10
11
12
13

 And regardless of how you would decide
that legal 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You agree with that

interpretation?
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

It's not something that we've

14

taken a position on in this case.

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

16

it's fair to rely on it.

17

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Then I don't think

Well, then I  I do think

18

it's fair to rely on it in light of the fact that no one

19

is collecting  no one is  there's not any

20

centralized mechanism to collect now.

21

 And that's really the second point that I

22

wanted to make, which is regardless of how you would

23

resolve that legal question, and actually the reason

24

that the administrative office has not, so far as we

25

know, taken a position on that, is because there are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

36
1
2

serious practical problems to collecting.
 One of those problems  when you  when

3

you look at the statute, Subsection (b) allows you to

4

take money from the trust accounts, so it's fairly easy

5

to collect while the individual is in prison.  But once

6

the person is out in the world, courts  each

7

individual court trying to collect filing fees that

8

are  that the inmates  the former inmate's on the

9

hook for is quite a difficult thing.

10

 We have spoken with folks from the

11

administrative office who tell us that there is not now

12

any centralized system for trying to refer those

13

obligations for treasury, and I think you could imagine

14

how cumbersome that would be.  So to think that

15

potentially paying five years down the road, or never

16

paying is any kind of marginal deterrent I think would

17

be wrong.

18

 We think that Congress knew that there were

19

multiple filers out there, and that if they were going

20

to file more lawsuits, they should pay more.  And just

21

to be clear about what Congress was saying here, no one

22

is precluded from going to court.  All Congress is

23

saying is something very reasonable, which is if you

24

have funds available and you continue filing more

25

lawsuits and appeals, you should have to pay.  You

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

37
1

should have to contribute.  And we think that that makes

2

complete sense.

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Saharsky, can I get back

4

to the $10 rule and the BOP policy with respect to this?

5

I think it was the Chief Justice who said that he didn't

6

really understand.  And I share his lack of

7

understanding about how the BOP is actually doing this,

8

given the language of the statute.

9

 The statute says, you know, "shall forward

10

payments each time the amount in the account exceeds

11

$10."  So that suggests to me that if you're looking at

12

an account with $10 and 1 cent, you make the next

13

payment.  And I understand from your brief that that's

14

not what the BOP is doing.  And how can the BOP be not

15

doing that?

16

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, a  a couple of

17

answers.  First of all, we think that that language that

18

you  you cited can be read multiple ways, as I think

19

the discussion with Justice Breyer perhaps suggested,

20

that it could mean a $10 floor or it could mean that you

21

start making payments at the $10 and then go below the

22

$10.

23

 The BOP has longstanding  has taken the

24

position, longstanding position, that you have a $10

25

floor that is not in any kind of regulation or published

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

38
1

guidance.  The way that we do it is we have a database

2

that is basically for inmate trust accounts.  It's just

3

an electronic system for having money coming in and out

4

of the accounts.  And we have had that $10 floor in

5

there since that database was set up in 2001.  But we

6

think the statute could be read both ways, and we think

7

it is more consistent with Congress's intention to leave

8

the $10 in 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, that's probably right.

10

But how can it be read that way?  Tell me how it can be

11

read that way.

12

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right.
You're saying you can't

14

touch $10.  In  in all cases, $10 will always remain

15

in the account.  How can you read it that way?

16

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, because when it says

17

"exceeds $10," I think you could  you could read it as

18

that it can't  kind of the flip side, that you can't

19

go below the $10.  Or you could say that you could start

20

at the 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Just read the language.

22

Read the language.  What  what language produces that

23

result?

24
25

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  We think that it

is  when you say it exceeds $10 that that means that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

39
1

you can't  there's the flip side of it that you can't

2

go below $10.  But to be 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That doesn't follow.  It 

4

it says you can take 20 percent if the account exceeds

5

$10.  If the account exceeds $10, you take 20 percent of

6

the account.

7

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, Justice Scalia 
That's what it says.
Right.  If  if you  we

10

think that it can read both ways, but this is  if you

11

disagreed about that, we don't think that that issue

12

resolves this case for a number 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Anyway, why can't you read

14

it that way?  You forward the payment each time the

15

amount exceeds $10.  Forwarding it consists of pressing

16

an electronic button.  And so the instant you press that

17

button, it does not exceed $10.  And there we have it.

18

So there is a way of construing the language which is

19

consistent with the obvious purpose to me, which is to

20

leave this prisoner with at least $10.

21

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, that's what we think.

22

We think it can be read multiple ways.  And so far as we

23

know about the experience, it has been read multiple

24

ways.  There are cases in the courts of appeals that

25

have read it one way versus the other.  To be clear

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

40
1

though, these cases not ones that have gone through any

2

detailed statutory analysis, not even as much detail as

3

this Court's discussion at argument today, but have just

4

said in an offhand line either you can go below the $10

5

or can't.  They've kind of gone both ways on that.

6

 And in terms of experience, we know from

7

Second Circuit's case that's cited in the briefs,

8

Whitfield, that New York did not go below the $10.  I

9

asked counsel of record for the States.  The States

10

filed a brief on our side of this case, and  and the

11

counsel of record is the Solicitor General of Michigan.

12

He said that Michigan does not go below the $10.  My

13

friend on the other side has suggested 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But does all of this by

15

all of the States, all of the prisons?  Because your

16

adversary says that some are going below the $10.

17

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I'm not sure that that's

18

true.  He cites two cases.  One is  they're from

19

Maryland and from Iowa.  One of the cases said that

20

there was  that it went below the $10 in a  in one

21

case.  But it didn't say that was the State policy.

22

I  you know, I don't know if it was.

23

 And then the second was an individual

24

accounting clerk who had gone below the $10 and who had

25

done it manually.  So I don't know that that represents

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

41
1
2

any kind of policy either.
 But if I could step back, I think it is not

3

necessary for this Court to resolve the $10 issue to

4

resolve the question presented, because the question is

5

should an inmate who files more cases have to make

6

monthly payments?

7

 And just as  and just parenthetically to

8

highlight why the Court doesn't need to resolve the $10

9

issue to resolve this case, this was not an issue that

10

Petitioner briefed before the D.C. Circuit.  It's not

11

anything that the D.C. Circuit's opinion addressed.  And

12

it's not something that was in the certiorari petition.

13

So why 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And that issue could come

15

up in the very first payment, couldn't it?  If the guy

16

has $10 and 1 cent in his account, the very first

17

payment could raise that issue.

18

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, that's true.
So it's not an issue

20

presented by the  by the question of whether you use

21

the percase or perprisoner approach.

22

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

25

I completely agree.
It's a problem either way.
However you resolve the

question presented, that would still be a separate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

42
1

question, one that the courts of appeals have not

2

considered in any level of detail.

3

 The extent 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Ms. Saharsky, I

5

find  I  I think others may too.  I find the issue

6

that's before us very difficult to resolve based on the

7

statutory language.  Is there any doctrine tantamount to

8

the rule of lenity in interpreting a criminal statute

9

that applies here?  Because the thing that strikes me

10

most is the extreme harshness of your position.  We're

11

talking about earning 23 cents an hour, filing fees of

12

$350, $505.  And the money is used to  for what?

13

Phone calls to family and friends, stamps for letters,

14

and to buy books.  And you're going to take the last,

15

you know, whatever so that someone who's in there for 20

16

years can't even buy a book?  That seems very, very

17

harsh.

18

 And you seem to be willing to interpret the

19

ambiguity in the statute to save the last $10, but

20

you're unwilling to interpret what I think at least I

21

regard as the ambiguity in the statute to allow

22

prisoners  I mean, they are prisoners.  They're not 

23

that's perhaps not entitled to any grace, but who in

24

some States earn 10 cents an hour.  You're not willing

25

to interpret that ambiguity in a way that allows them to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

43
1

keep that so they can pay for phone calls to their

2

family.

3

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, a couple of answers.

4

First of all, we think that this is not  this  this

5

question of a person having so little in their money 

6

money in their the account only arises in the case that

7

you're talking about someone who has filed five or more

8

lawsuits, which is not the ordinary case.  I mean, it is

9

obviously a case to consider.  But at least in the BOP's

10

experience, the vast majority of people who have orders

11

owed are for one lawsuit, two lawsuits.  Most of the

12

court of appeals' cases below are like that, et cetera.

13

 Putting that to the side, of course, this

14

statute never prevents a prisoner from bringing a

15

meritorious case because of the safetyvalve provision.

16

We also interpret the $10 amount to leave money in the

17

account.

18

 There's also, of course, administrative

19

remedies, which administrative exhaustion is required.

20

So that helps resolve any questions about making sure

21

that claims are heard.  And, in fact, the BOP does have

22

the discretion to allow phone calls, et cetera, to

23

indigent prisoner, also stamps, et cetera, et cetera.

24

 So in terms of what you potentially perceive

25

as harshness, this only arises in cases where an inmate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

44
1

is filing so many cases, that potentially a large

2

portion of his income used to pay filing fees.  And

3

really that's 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Just a thought.

5

Well, if you're there for 20 years, maybe you should let

6

them buy a book.

7

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  And this  again,

8

this situation there  I think most prisons actually

9

have libraries that books are available.  And like the

10
11
12
13

Court has had some cases about what libraries 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sure they are 

I'm sure they are very good libraries, too.
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, just  just to be

14

clear, you know, this is a situation that only arises in

15

the fairly atypical situation.  We  it's true that the

16

statute does not specifically address the  the

17

situation of a prisoner with five lawsuits or six

18

lawsuits and orders et cetera.  But we think the reason

19

that that is and that the Seventh Circuit suggested in

20

one of the early opinions after PLRA was enacted is

21

because Congress thought that the three  threestrikes

22

provision was going to prevent all of these lawsuits,

23

but it 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do a lot of prisoners buy

books?  I mean, does Amazon really make a lot of money

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

45
1

off these people?

2

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 MS. SAHARSKY:  the experience that we have

5

in this case, for example, might be good to highlight,

6

which is Pinson, the individual who has filed more than

7

a hundred cases  gets regular deposits into his

8

account, had been using them to buy books and other

9

materials.  Those are in the Joint Appendix starting on

I can't say, you know 
I don't think 

10

pages 55, 56, et cetera.  So it shows that prisoners are

11

able to  even Pinson who has filed over a hundred

12

cases is able to  to pay those amounts.

13

 And just to  just to clarify, I think the

14

Court is thinking of a situation of, you know, a

15

prisoner who has 10 cents of income or $10 of income.

16

But we don't think that that is the typical situation.

17

Pinson's account at the time he filed showed that he

18

received an average of  I think it was $48 a month of

19

income.  I have asked the BOP for statistics just

20

because I was curious about what is the median income

21

that's received, what is the median deposit.  They said

22

that for the  the past fiscal year, the median 

23

median income an inmate receives is approximately $120 a

24

month.  So, in fact, with that, if an inmate has 20

25

percent that he's paying towards filing fees, he could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

46
1

pay them off at a reasonable rate.  And we think that

2

that's just really a much better alternative from what

3

Congress intended.

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But that does raise  I

5

mean, as Mr. Shelley says, using that exact $50 number.

6

If you have $50 and you have five lawsuits, the $50 is

7

gone, assuming that the BOP's policy is not uniform and

8

maybe is not statutorily authorized.

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Yes, I think that  I think

10

that that is the implication of it, and we think that

11

that is what Congress intended.

12

 I am not sure if the Court is interested in

13

such information, but we actually did go ahead and just

14

look in our database to see how many inmates have one

15

PLRA order that they're paying as opposed to five orders

16

that we're paying.  And what we found, just checking

17

last week, was that inmates  there are 944 inmates of

18

the over 200,000 in the federal system who are paying on

19

one order, and only 60 inmates of the over 200,000 who

20

are paying on five or more orders or who had six, and

21

then 42 inmates who have six or more orders.

22

 So this actually is a  a very small

23

problem, at least federally, and we would not want this

24

very small tail to wag the dog of this statute that is

25

clearly  clearly intended by Congress to make sure

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

47
1

that inmates who are filing frivolous lawsuits have a

2

financial disincentive to do so.  And 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Be clear about your

4

policy.  And I think your adversary agrees.  Under (a),

5

the 20 percent has to be paid on all five cases whether

6

the amount is above 10 or  the amount in the account

7

is above 10 or below 10, correct?

8

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

10

would always wipe out the $10.

11

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Correct.
So those five cases

The $10 is not an impediment

12

to the initial partial filing fee.  It is only in the

13

second part of it.  That 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So  and so the $10

15

floor starts once the account goes up  you have to 

16

a bottom.  You have always $10 in your account, but any

17

dollar that goes into your account after that,

18

20 percent has to be paid.

19

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  Be we think 

20

assuming that it's over the $10.  But we think that 

21

that there's a  you know, that there's at least $10 in

22

the account or would wait until there was $10 in the

23

account.  So if I'm understanding your question

24

correctly, we would wait until there was $10 in the

25

account as just a matter of 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

48
1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you would take

2

20 percent.  Let's say there's $10 and  there's $11.

3

The one extra dollar is paid to whom?

4

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

6

To 
Let's assume there's

five cases there.

7

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

We would  if we can't pay

8

all of the five cases, as we believe Congress intended,

9

we would pay the oldest lawsuit.  The oldest  and 

10

and  and I don't mean that by filing date.  I mean the

11

oldest order that was 

12
13
14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Would take that entire

$1?
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Yes.  Because the statute

15

says to pay 20 percent per case, so we would try to do

16

the closest thing that we  we could to that.

17

 And as Justice Ginsburg said, you can't get

18

blood out of a stone.  There comes a point at which, if

19

there's not funds, we can't pay.  But as we understand

20

the statute, and we think it makes perfect sense in

21

terms of what Congress wanted, if you have money

22

available and you continue to file more lawsuits and get

23

orders entered, that you  the inmate should have to

24

pay for them.

25

 So at the end of the day, we think that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

49
1

D.C. Circuit got it right, that both when you look at

2

the specific text of this provision, which is

3

Subsection (b) about filing fees but really the entire

4

statute written from the perspective of a single case, a

5

checklist for a single case, that Congress wanted

6

inmates who were filing more lawsuits to pay more.

7

 And we think that that makes sense and that

8

also  and I want  this is, I think, a partial answer

9

to one of the prior questions of the Chief Justice in

10

terms of interpretative canons, etc., that it's

11

consistent with what this Court did last term in the

12

Coleman case.

13

 In the Coleman case the Court was

14

considering the threestrikes provision, but it

15

recognized that that provision is written from the

16

perspective of a single case, a single action, or

17

appeal.  You could get a strike for the action.  You

18

could get a strike for the appeal.

19

 And the same thing we think is true for the

20

filing fees.  You could owe the filing fees for the

21

action.  You could owe the filing fees for the appeal.

22

And we think that that makes complete sense.

23

 So unless there are further questions, we

24

would urge the Court to affirm the decision of the

25

D.C. Circuit.

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

2

 Oh, you have four minutes remaining.

3

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY F. SHELLEY

4

Thank you, counsel.

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

 MR. SHELLEY: 

6

 First of all, with respect to the  the

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

hypothetical that Justice Sotomayor asked, in fact, I

8

think if the account had $11 in it, the government's

9

position would lead to none of the clerks of the courts

10

being paid because the first payment would take the 

11

the balance under $10.  So that seems, again, as a

12

number of justices have mentioned, other than

13

Justice Breyer, a perverse reading of the $10 rule.

14

 But I also want to take on the idea that

15

this is the only provision in the statute that provides

16

for a financial effect on the prisoner when filing a

17

lawsuit.  No  as the Chief Justice mentioned, the

18

initial partial filing fee applies in every case.  No

19

$10 rule.  No minimum.

20

 So that is a  an immediate financial

21

incentive not to file a frivolous lawsuit because money

22

is going to go immediately.  And if it doesn't go

23

immediately, it's a debt that gets paid sequentially,

24

much like the perprisoner approach would adopt for

25

(b)(2).  But (b)(2) then takes a longerterm point of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

51
1

view.  (b)(1) is an immediate financial disincentive.

2

(b)(2) is the longer financial disincentive month after

3

month with the installment payments.

4

 I also want to take on the idea that "fees"

5

and "filing fee" appear interchangeably in the statute.

6

They do not.  Ms. Saharsky mentioned the word "fees,"

7

but "fees" unadorned with the word "filing" in front of

8

it appears differently than does the word "filing fees."

9

 The plural "filing fees" appears in exactly

10

two spots:  (b)(2).  And then in the crossreference to

11

the cost section, I believe it's (f)  in the (f)

12

section where it says that costs shall be charged the

13

same way as filing fees.  They both use the plural

14

"filing fees."

15

 So this was purposeful. 

Congress used the

16

plural "filing fees" only twice.  And that's because, I

17

think, they were talking about the  the numerous cases

18

being paid to a single clerk.

19

 And finally, I'd like to say, it has often

20

been said that the measure of a society is not how it

21

treats it's outstanding citizens but how it treats

22

weakest.

23

 Here there's no  it's criminals. 

Here

24

there's no real reason to pile on to prisoners with this

25

additional onerous financial incentive when the other

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

52
1

aspects of the PLRA do the work of deterring frivolous

2

lawsuits along with the disincentive that's provided


3


under the perprisoner approach.
