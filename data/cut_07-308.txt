MR. JAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

Respondent sought and received a full refund

three-year period permitted them by the tax-refund

statute.

The plain and unabiguous terms of the

tax-refund statute, section 7422(a), expressly provide

that any claimant who alleges that a tax has been

6

Internal Revenue Service within three years after filing

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Jay, is the government

running with the fox and chasing with the hounds?

You

10

want us to apply the provisions governing the Internal

11

Revenue Code with regard to whether the statute has

12

expired, but when it comes to interest you say oh, no,

13

no, no, that doesn't apply.

14

go pari passu, as we say?

15

MR. JAY:

Why?

Why shouldn't the two

Well, we think, Your Honor, that

16

the interest provision is in fact a key part of the

17

tax-refund statute and so Respondent's attempt to invoke

18

the tax-refund judgment interest provision is

19

inconsistent with their theory, that they're proceeding

20

outside the scope of the tax --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, yes, they make the same

22

mistake, but that doesn't justify your making the same,

23

the same mistake.

And both sides want to -- want to split them

MR. JAY:

Well, we think the whole case is

5

in the Title 26 pot, Your Honor, that the whole case

should proceed under the provisions of Title 26, meaning

7

that Respondents have already received the full tax

8

refund to which they are entitled.

And to be sure, they

But if the Court were to agree with them and

17

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you explain one thing

to me?

I take it that they -- everybody says they went

6

8

they get interest.

9

MR. JAY:

11

That's right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, what they want is they

want three years before that.

Which is it?

Or is the government saying:

And I don't see how it could be

5

MR. JAY:

It is the former, Your Honor -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. JAY:

Okay.

-- because we're saying that

8

because Respondents waited for 21 years while paying the

9

tax without -- without filing a refund claim, that

10

they're limited to the three years immediately preceding

11

the refund claim -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

I thought you were

13

making a second argument, that even if they were

14

entitled to it despite the statute, they wouldn't be

15

entitled to interest.

16

MR. JAY:

You don't make that claim?
No.

If they were entitled to sue,

17

not under the tax -- under the tax code at all, but on

18

the theory countenanced by the court of appeals, that

19

this is not a suit for a tax refund at all, but a suit

20

for damages arising directly under the Constitution -

is the point of going through any kind of administrative

process of the refund route?
MR. JAY:

In the context of the coal tax,

12

Your Honor, and the Export Clause claim, the purpose of

13

requiring exhaustion, requiring Respondents to proceed

14

before the IRS, is that the coal tax is exempt from

15

taxation under the Constitution only if the coal at the

16

moment the tax is imposed, which in this case is when

17

it's first sold by the manufacturer, the mining company,

18

if at that moment, the coal was in the stream of export.

19

And in the context of the coal industry that can be a

20

fairly fact-specific question, and the IRS technical

21

advice memorandum that we've cited on page 11 of our

22

reply brief explains that to some degree.

23

possible for a timely refund claim to allow the IRS to

24

examine the facts and circumstances of the transaction

25

and determine whether in fact the coal was in the stream
8

Alderson Reporting Company

So it's

of export at all.
Further, the IRS -- if it has only an excise

3

tax return from the taxpayer, IRS has no idea what

4

percentage of that coal was exported.

5

percent of the coal mined in the United States remains

6

in the United States and there's nothing on Form 720,

7

the excite tax return, that specifies how much of that

coal is exported.

9

refund claim the taxpayer puts the IRS on notice of what

10

percentage of coal in the given years was in fact in the

11

stream of export when it was sold, whether in fact the

broker or whoever purchased it actually purchased it,

13

actually exported it from the country, and also how -

14

what the dollar amount of tax refund is being sought.

19

directly to court.

20

And if the IRS denies the

The IRS did not in fact deny their claim,

21

and the IRS has issued a notice of acquiescence

specifying that the coal tax -- coal taxpayers who paid

receive a refund to the full extent that Congress has

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In the McKesson case, Your Honor,

10

in the stability of their tax revenues while providing

12

which States can -- States and other taxing authorities

limitations.

Well, Your Honor, in McKesson the

Court pointed to another alternative, which is requiring

that the tax be paid under protest.

23

24

taxpayer has to identify the basis of the constitutional

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think there are any

16

circumstances in which a taxpayer can bring a claim

17

under the Tucker Act for the refund of an

18

unconstitutional tax?

19

MR. JAY:

Well, we think -- I want to

20

clarify, Your Honor, that any lawsuit, whether it's on

21

Respondent's theory or on our theory, any lawsuit that's

22

filed is in fact under the Tucker Act.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, any situation in which

24

such a suit can be brought without having filed a claim

25

previously with the IRS?
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. JAY:

If the only -- if the only basis

2

for the taxpayers' recovery is that the taxpayer has

3

paid a tax and the tax was illegally or erroneously

4

assessed because it was unconstitutional, we think that

5

section 7422(a) and the associated time limits provide

6

the procedure for recovering under the Tucker Act.

7

Section 2501, which is what Respondents

8

contend is the only procedure that applies to the claims

9

that they have brought, section 2501, as the Court

10
11

recognized JUSTICE ALITO:

Just to be clear, so your

12

argument is not limited to the Export Clause.

13

doesn't matter what provision of the Constitution the

14

The same rule would apply?

MR. JAY:

Well, the Congress has made no

16

distinction in the statute between one type of

17

constitutional claim and another, or indeed one type of

18

illegality or another.

19

examples in our opening brief of numerous constitutional

20

provisions that taxpayers may bring challenges under.

21

And there are at least five clauses in the original

22

Constitution that regulate the Federal Government's

24

Bill of Rights.

And we've cited some -- some

There are at least four more that

Alderson Reporting Company

So constitutional claims are commonly

2

brought by taxpayers against Federal taxes, and the

3

tax-refund procedure provides a full -- a fully

The only requirement is that it be submitted in writing

Do you know, what happened

15

Was there a constitutional cause of

MR. JAY:

Before there was the Tucker Act,

16

Your Honor, when the government took property and was

17

obliged to pay compensation, the claim was presented to

18

Congress; and Congress could legislative relief by a

19

private bill.

20

Eventually, Congress created the Court of

21

Claims purely as an Article I tribunal.

There was no

22

judicial review because the decisions were always

23

subject to revision by Congress.

24

Congress, having tired of adjudicating all these claims

25

in a legislative manner, gave the Court of Claims

And eventually

independent status with its decisions reviewable in

2

Article III courts.

3

takings claims became brought in the Court of Federal

4

Claims.

5

And so, by enacting the Tucker Act,

So, because we think Section 7422(a) is a

6

completely adequate remedy for any constitutional claim

7

that Respondents might bring, we submit that this

8

Court's Bivens cases and this Court's unlawful-tax cases

9

show that there is no warrant to create a new cause of

10

action directly under the Constitution in circumstances

11

like this where the taxpayer has a fully effective

12

remedy, allows that remedy to become time-barred, but

13

instead brings a claim, purportedly under the

14

Constitution, against the identical defendant, in the

15

identical forum seeking the identical relief.

16

those circumstances, this Court has never fashioned a

17

Bivens-type implied cause of action for a violation of

18

the Constitution.

19

Under

Indeed, in Bush versus Lucas, Schweiker

20

versus Chilicky, and other cases, the Court has

21

recognized that when Congress has legislated a remedial

22

scheme, it doesn't -- this Court will still stay its

23

hand before creating a new Bivens action, even if that

24

remedial scheme has very short time limits, such as the

25

30-day time limit, the civil service remedies that were
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

at issue in Bush, or the exhaustion requirement of Title

2

VII which substitutes for an equal-protection claim for

3

Federal employees.

4

Even in those circumstances, and even if the

5

remedies that are available are equitable and not money

6

damages, even in those circumstances this Court will not

7

create a new cause of action for money damages.

8

this case, if Respondents had filed in a timely way in

9

this -- referring to the relief that they're seeking in

16

If they had filed by April 30th, 1997, by which

So their failure to assert their rights in a

17

timely way certainly didn't give the court of appeals

18

warrant to create a new Bivens-type implied right of

action.

If the Court has no further questions at
this time, I'll reserve.

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

This is a question of statutory construction

5

and the problem, as this Court's precedent has made

6

clear in Enochs versus Williams Packing, is that if

7

government -- if the government wants to enjoy the

8

special, extraordinary protections of the tax-refund

9

scheme, it has to assert a plausible basis for tax

10

liability.

11

any claim that they have any legitimate right to this

12

revenue as a source, as a basis, for taxes; that they

have any legitimate tax regulatory power over this

19

Are there any complexities like

MS. MILLETT:

Justice Kennedy, there is a

20

statutory definition, 26 U.S.C. 1421, that deals with

stream of commerce and it mirrors this Court's decision

22

in the A.G. Spalding case, which says that either the

23

direct sales or if your manufacturer doesn't sell

directly to the exporter or it has the broker, so one or

6

MS. MILLETT:

I think it would clear up an

7

awful lot.

If I could just clarify, though.

What this

8

court held in Enochs versus William Packing is that the

9

phrase "any tax" only applies if the government is at

10

least willing to assert a plausible defense for the tax.

11

And so it would depend on whether any tax would still

12

include that limitation in your scenario, if they are

13

willing to assert a plausible Export Clause.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Nothing different from

15

what it is now, but just Congress makes clear that a tax

16

and alleged violation of the Export Clause falls within

17

the term "any Internal Revenue tax"?

18

MS. MILLETT:

Then I think my position would

19

be that it does not, because this Court has held for

half a century without Congress changing it that any tax

means a tax that the government asserts is valid.

doesn't have to be correct.

The problem in this case,

There

was a statute imposing the coal tax, 26 U.S.C. 4121 -

this is all on the first page of our brief -- and then

11

there was an amendment to the exemption for exports in

26 U.S.C. 4221 that specifically said the general tax

exemption for exports does not apply to this coal tax,

and that provision captured nothing but exports of coal.

Your point is that you

if the government was -- although it did ask for the

money as a tax, they are really out to lunch?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If indeed the taxpayer pays out the money for an

15

unconstitutional export tax, it seems to me that person

has no claim until he complies with the administrative

procedures that render that tax unconstitutional.

JUSTICE BREYER:

In looking at your

argument, I see it now, I think, if I'm right.

You're

8

-- that it would have very broad reach.

9

-- it doesn't just concern the constitutional claim; it

It would reach

10

concerns any claim you'd have against the IRS.

And

11

there's authority that says if the IRS' position is too

12

far out, you can go get an injunction.

13

you're pointing to.

14

because of that authority, that kind of an exception for

15

the far out IRS claim also applies to the statute of

limitation and administrative requirement.

And your

17

problem is the latter has never been held.

And the

18

reason that that's a problem, I take it, is because when

19

you're talking about injunctions, you're talking about

20

basic equity, but when you're talking about later on

administrative requirements, there's really no reason

they couldn't have filed the claim.

that they say "in respect of any Internal Revenue tax"

source of revenue.

protect revenue interest, to make you pay the revenue

any tax in any court means the same thing in 7422 that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. JAY:

I'll be glad to, Your Honor.

7

Enochs case construed not Section 7422, but Section

8

7421, the Injunction Act provision of the tax code.

9

the question in Enochs was whether the taxpayer simply

And

10

by alleging that the tax was so -- so invalidly applied

11

that it was only in the guise of the tax could avoid

12

paying the tax and bring an injunctive claim.

13

The court in Enochs held that it could not

14

because the taxpayer had not, in fact, satisfied the

15

basic requirement of all claims for injunctive relief as

16

irreparable injury.

17

whether a tax is defensible for purposes of this very

18

narrow exception is to be determined on the basis of the

19

information to the government at the time of suit.

20

in this -

21
22
23

And the court also held that

JUSTICE SCALIA:
exception?

So

Wait what very narrow

It didn't apply the exception.
MR. JAY:

As the Court was preserving, I

24

think, in Dick, though, because -- because the Court

25

ultimately denied the exception in that case and in each
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case since, preserving the holding in Standard Nut and

2

Margarine, a case from the 1920's.

3

alluded to this when he asked my friend, Ms. Millett,

4

about whether this exception is geared primarily to

5

factual issues or to legal issues.

6

Margarine the government had decided to attempt to

7

impose a tax meant for oleomargarine on a product made

8

entirely from nuts.

9

construing the tax-injunctive provision, simply

Justice Breyer

In Standard Nut and

And this Court, you know, without

10

referring to principles of equity, this Court held that

11

the government's theory of assessing the tax was simply

12

in the guise of a tax and it permitted the injunctive

13

claim to proceed.

14

In Williams Packing the government's -- the

15

government had a collateral basis for assessing the tax,

16

and so the taxpayer was remitted to the same remedy that

17

any taxpayer who wants to challenge a tax as having been

18

unlawfully assessed or collected is subject to; that is,

19

to pay the tax, file a refund claim, and if the refund

20

claim is upheld either by the IRS or subsequently in

21

court, to receive a full refund with interest.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Don't the two go together?

23

If you could bring an injunction action, surely you

24

don't have to pay the tax.

25

MR. JAY:

Well, if you can satisfy the
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

requirements for injunctive relief -- and Williams

2

Packing, the taxpayer, couldn't; and in the cases since

3

the taxpayer couldn't -- then the court can enjoin the

4

collection of the taxes applied to you.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's what she is

6

saying.

7

That this is not -- not a plausible tax; and, therefore,

8

she could have gotten an injunction; and, therefore, by

9

a parity of reasoning, she doesn't have to go through

10

the tax provisions.

11
12
13

She is saying that those conditions exist here.

MR. JAY:

I think I have three responses to

that.
One is that we don't think that a -- an

14

exception to the -- to 7421 should carry over into

15

Section 7422.

16

case, this is a facially constitutional tax.

17

imposed on coal mined in the United States.

18

-- if none of the coal that is subject to the tax is

19

ever in the stream of export when the tax is imposed,

20

then the tax is perfectly constitutional.

21

why Section 4121 remains on the books today.

22

But even in the circumstances of this
The tax is
And if no

And that is

The tax is unconstitutional only in certain

23

narrow circumstances when the coal actually is is in the

24

stream of export. As I explained -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you could say the

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

same about the tax on oleomargarine.

2

valid tax but not when you impose it on nuts.

3

the tax on coal is a perfectly valid tax, but not when

4

you impose it on coal that's in the stream of export.

5

MR. JAY:

It is a perfectly
And here

But if one of these coal companies

6

had sought to enjoin the tax, the government would have

7

pointed to the provision in Williams Packing that says

8

that whether the tax is defensible is to be determined

9

on the basis of the information available to the

10

government at the time of suit until the taxpayer

11

demonstrates that the coal is actually in the stream of

12

export, which is precisely what's done during the refund

13

process that the taxpayers used in this case to show

14

that their coal was in the stream of export when they

15

obtained the refund.

16

obtained a full -- full relief.

17

That's what -- that's how they

But, in any event, the history of this

18

litigation shows that this is not -- this is not a claim

19

about the facial unconstitutionality of the tax because

20

the tax continued to be collected without protest in the

21

case of the Respondents here for 21 consecutive years.

22

And by the time they filed for a refund this

23

Court had decided IBM.

It had decided U.S. shoe.

24

district court had decided Ranger Fuel, and the

25

government had announced that it would not appeal the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decision in Ranger Fuel striking down the coal tax.

2

But that doesn't mean that for that -- for

3

that entire time the government had no basis on which to

4

defend the tax.

5

arguments to defend the tax at issue in U.S. Shoe in

6

June 1996.

7

arguments to defend the harbor maintenance tax in U.S.

8

Shoe.

9

in 1998.

10

I mean the government had colorful

Shoe was in 1996.

I may have misspoke.

And it had colorful

IBM in 1996, and U.S. Shoe

So to say that during the period at issue in

11

this case, 1994 through 1996, the tax was so facially

12

invalid that the narrow Williams Packing exception to

13

another statutory provision justifies Respondents'

14

attempt to circumvent the tax refund statute, we just

15

think is not correct.

16

In the case of a taxpayer who -- who can

17

satisfy the exception, you know, the Tax Code does,

18

indeed, put that taxpayer to the choice.

19

a fully effective post- payment refund remedy where they

20

can avoid any penalties and interest by paying the tax

21

and litigating for a full refund.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

It gives them

Is the government's

23

view that the money that they are seeking here, if you

24

look at 7422, that it falls within the language of any

25

Internal Revenue tax alleged to be erroneously or
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

illegally assessed or the language "any sum alleged to

2

have been in any manner wrongfully collected," or both?

3
4

MR. JAY:

beyond the first clause, Your Honor.

5
6

I don't think that we need to go

JUSTICE BREYER:

So when I decide this case,

I should forget the words "any sum"?

7

MR. JAY:

I mean the Court construed a

8

similar provision in Flora versus United States in 1960,

9

which explained that "any sum" is a cumulative

10

provision.

11

an Internal Revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously

12

or illegally collected or assessed, that's as far as you

13

need to go.

14

So that if something is within the scope of

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it means that if, in

15

fact, it is not within the scope of the word "tax," then

16

it is not within "any sum"?

17

MR. JAY:

No.

To the contrary, Your Honor.

18

I think that the holding in Flora is that if it's not

19

within the scope of the first provision, then you would

20

need to look at the second -- actually the third

21

provision, the "any sum" language.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

In Enochs -- she is quite

23

right, your opposing lawyer -- it says the exaction is

24

merely in the guise of a tax.

25

within the guise of a tax, then it doesn't fall within

And when it says it is

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Tax Injunction Act.

2

And there it says if it is clear that under

3

no circumstances could the government ultimately

4

prevail, the central purpose of the Tax Injunction Act

5

is inapplicable.

6

tax.

7

here.

And then it's just in the guise of a

And that, she says, is the test we should apply
So that's where I think Justice Ginsburg began.

8

What is your specific response to that?

9

MR. JAY:

Well, my specific response, Your

10

Honor, first is that in this case the tax simply was not

11

in the guise of a tax.

12

the taxpayer were -- if a taxpayer were alleging that

13

the coal tax were in the guise of a tax and that it,

14

therefore, could bring a prepayment -- a prepayment

15

action, it does not then follow that the taxpayer could

16

still after the fact, if it opted not to bring that

17

prepayment action, the taxpayer could then escape the

18

three-year, nontollable, unusually emphatic limitation

19

period that applies to a claim for a postpayment remedy,

20

which is the exclusive means of obtaining a postpayment

21

remedy.

22

But even if, you know, today, if

And, you know, the courts recognized time

23

and again that taxing authorities have a strong interest

24

in fiscal stability, and it effectively closes the books

25

on a particular tax year.

So that taxpayers, after the
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

tax is paid, if they want to protest the tax, they have

2

three years in which to put the government on notice.

3

That, you know, even if the claim is this tax is so

4

beyond the pale that it can't be defended, they have to

5

put the government on notice of that claim.

6

And if they do, then the IRS considers it;

7

and if the IRS turns them down, then they can proceed to

8

district court or to the Court of Federal Claims.

9

In addition, I think I just wanted to

10

clarify one point about the availability of prepayment

11

remedies in this case.

12

friend, Miss Millett, was correct about the fact that

13

this excise tax does not -- is not susceptible to the

14

deficiency proceeding in tax court.

15

I think, Justice Ginsburg, my

And we have cited in footnote 7 of our reply

16

brief at page 16 the possibility that there may be

17

another route if the taxpayer feels strongly about the

18

unconstitutionality of the tax and is willing to take

19

the chance that if the taxpayer's position is rejected,

20

that the taxpayer may be liable for penalties and

21

interest for not paying the tax.

22

I mean, of course, the general rule is that

23

the taxpayer is expected to pay the tax and proceed

24

postpayment by putting the IRS on notice of the claim.

25

But Congress, in Section 6330(c)(2)(B) of Title 26, has
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

provided some limited ability, if a taxpayer has not

2

previously been able to litigate the merits of the tax,

3

the taxpayer has a limited opportunity to do so first

4

before the IRS, then in Tax Court, and then before the

5

Court of Appeals.

6

And, again, on Miss Millett's supposition

7

that this is a completely, clearly unconstitutional tax,

8

then the taxpayer would have the option of doing that.

9

Again, the refund scheme is set up so that if the

10

taxpayer doesn't want to take the chance that its

11

argument will not be accepted, the taxpayer has a

12

simple, open remedy:

13

point within three years.

14

To file a refund claim at any

That's exactly what Respondents did not do

15

for the 21 consecutive years that they paid this tax

16

without complaint.

17

If the Court has no further questions?
