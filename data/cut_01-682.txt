CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Robbins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


8
9
10

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:

The Eighth Circuit held in this case that a


11

private plaintiff may obtain punitive damages in an action


12

brought against municipal government defendants under


13

section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and title II


14

of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 


15

Although the court of appeals identified


16

substantial evidence in the legislative record that


17

Congress never intended this result, it thought that this


18

Court's decision in Franklin against Gwinnett County


19

Public Schools left it little or no choice in the matter. 


20

As the Eighth Circuit read Franklin, once a cause of


21

action has been created or inferred, it presumptively


22

carries with it all common law remedies, including


23

punitive damages, unless Congress has specifically said


24

otherwise.


25

QUESTION:

Mr. Robbins, did any -- did the

3

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

petitioners raise the Newport case at any time below?


2

MR. ROBBINS:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBBINS:

5

QUESTION:

No. 


Why not? 

The -- the party --


I mean, it looks like the most


6

obvious source of law on this topic.

7

here?


8
9

MR. ROBBINS:

What's going on


In the lower court, my client took


the position that it was, in fact, an arm of the State,


10

not an arm of the municipal government.

11

factors -- it cited various factors that in its view


12

warranted an Eleventh Amendment immunity, not a City of


13

Newport immunity.

14

being reviewed before this Court today, rejected that


15

argument.

16

that decision.


17

For various


The court of appeals, in the decision


We have not separately sought certiorari on


But I -- I do want to add on that point, Justice


18

O'Connor, that in our view it would be a mistake to take


19

respondent's suggestion that because my client took that


20

position in the lower court, that this Court should


21

therefore turn a blind eye to the City of Newport


22

doctrine.

23

situation in which a litigant, for example, decided to


24

argue only legislative history in the lower court and then


25

before this Court -- and then someone said, well, you're


It seems to us that it's quite analogous to a


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

therefore constrained not to look at the words of the


2

statute.

3
4

That seems --

QUESTION:

It doesn't change the issue, I take


it.


5

MR. ROBBINS:

It does not change the issue.

The


6

position the client took below was always that punitive


7

damages are unwarranted for a variety of reasons,


8

including a reason that we are now urging by virtue of the


9

client having lost the Eleventh Amendment immunity issue


10

below. 


11

QUESTION:

Was there a reason?


12

QUESTION:

And I suppose it's not like an


13

immunity from suit that can be waived.

14

term immunity, but it's not that sort of immunity. 


15

MR. ROBBINS:

Exactly.

It's -- we use the


It -- it is exactly the


16

sense in which it was used in City of Newport as a


17

background principle of law that Congress is assumed to


18

have taken into consideration in enacting the actual test. 


19

And we --


20

QUESTION:

Doesn't the Eighth Circuit allow you


21

to argue in the alternative?

22

said we have Eleventh Amendment immunity and -- and if we


23

don't, we're a municipality, and therefore Newport


24

applies.

25

I mean, you couldn't have


You could have done that, I suppose. 

MR. ROBBINS:

I -- I think counsel could have

5

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

taken that measure.

2

it -- that that amounts to a waiver. 


3

QUESTION:

They didn't, but I don't think that


What are we supposed to do then? 


4

Because it seems to me that you're arguing there are two


5

possibilities.

6

damages no matter who he sues, and the second is that,


7

anyway, a person who sues a municipality can't get


8

punitive damages.

9

stronger than the first.

One possibility is no one gets punitive


Your second argument may be a lot

So, am I supposed to go to the


10

second argument that nobody has argued in the courts below


11

at all, bypassing them, or am I supposed to go to the


12

first argument which has enormous implications well beyond


13

this case? 


14

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think the answer, Justice


15

Breyer, is that we have urged both arguments.

16

-- we could prevail on the basis of either presumption.


17

I think we


I -- I would, however, tell you why I think the


18

Court ought to address the broader issue and that is


19

because, given the construction of Franklin that the


20

Eighth Circuit took in this case, there is no good reason


21

to believe that were City of Newport called to their


22

attention, they would have come out any differently.

23

Eighth Circuit took Franklin to say that unless -- given


24

that there's a cause of action, whether explicit --


25

whether express or implied, that must necessarily carry

The


1

with it all common law remedies unless Congress has said


2

otherwise, which it rarely does --


3

QUESTION:

Well, the Eighth Circuit said


4

appropriate remedies.

5

appropriate means in this context?


6
7

So, don't we have to look at what


MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think that -- that's the


language from Franklin.

Yes. 


8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ROBBINS:

And we think Franklin is properly


10

confined to compensatory remedies for the reasons we've


11

said in the brief.

12

appropriate, however, Your Honor, was that it is


13

synonymous with whatever the common law has traditionally


14

made available by virtue of State law, by virtue of


15

Federal law, by virtue of the entire corpus of law.

16

whatever you can find on the books is, therefore,


17

appropriate within the meaning of Franklin, as the Eighth


18

Circuit saw it, and that, Justice Breyer, to return to


19

your question, is a doctrine of enormous capacity. 


20

The Eighth Circuit's view of


QUESTION:

And


Mr. Robbins, I don't understand why


21

you say if this Court says Newport or Fact Concepts,


22

whatever you want to call it -- it says, a municipality is


23

immune.

24

Court -- this Court were to say, Eighth Circuit, you


25

overlooked the fact that municipalities are immune and


Period.

That takes care of your case, and if the


7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

therefore in -- in this case you are wrong, and we


2

reverse, now, that takes care of your client.

3

MR. ROBBINS:

4

QUESTION:

Right?


Well, I -- I think it does.

And why should we in your case, where


5

there is a clear ground, not decide it on that basis?

6

should we go to the next case that doesn't involve a


7

municipality?


8
9

If --


MR. ROBBINS:

Why


Let me say two things with respect


to that, Justice Ginsburg.

First of all, the last thing I


10

want to do is talk the Court out of ruling for my client


11

on any ground. 


12

(Laughter.) 


13

MR. ROBBINS:

So, if the Court believes City of


14

Newport is sufficient -- and we think it's quite powerful


15

-- we'll certainly be glad of that result.

16

two more things about it. 


17

But let me say


The first is even City of Newport requires


18

looking to the next step and asking, okay, that's the


19

presumption.

20

specific evidence in the statute that overcomes it?

21

all the reasons we've said in the brief and I'd be glad to


22

turn to, the evidence in this statute is quite


23

extraordinarily compelling that, to the contrary, punitive


24

damages were foreclosed. 


25

It's a strong presumption.

Is there

For


Second, I -- I wish I could be as confident as

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court's -- as Your Honor's question suggests, that


2

were this case to return to the Eighth Circuit with


3

nothing but a ruling about City of Newport, you know, in


4

its sails, that the Eighth Circuit would take that mandate


5

and take it and -- and come out differently.

6

quite so confident about that because of the sweep of how


7

they read Franklin.


8

QUESTION:

If the Court --


9

QUESTION:

We would -- the -- the broader


I'm not


10

position would be -- would be taking the case on the same


11

basis that the Eighth Circuit decided it.

12

broader ground.


13

MR. ROBBINS:

14

QUESTION:

15

Right?

On the


I think that's correct. 


And there -- this is not a


constitutional matter. 


16

MR. ROBBINS:

17

QUESTION:

No. 


So, the doctrine of -- of observing


18

the narrowest possible constitutional ground does not


19

apply here.

20

Right? 


MR. ROBBINS:

No.

Quite -- quite the contrary. 


21

The question presented is what do these statutes mean


22

after all. 


23

QUESTION:

So, this would be an opportunity to


24

-- to do what the Court is supposed to do, and that is


25

clean up confusion below on the meaning of a statute, and

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the broader confusion is certainly much -- much more worth


2

clearing up than the narrower confusion.


3

MR. ROBBINS:

Right, and I might say one of the


4

matters we've pointed to in the petition for certiorari


5

is, in fact, that this misconstruction of Franklin is not


6

confined to this case, to this statute, and certainly to


7

the Eighth Circuit.

8

reading of what this Court said -- not just meant, but


9

said -- in Franklin itself.

10

It is a wide-ranging, I think, over-


And perhaps I might just turn


briefly to that initial question.


11

It seems to us, for several reasons, the Eighth


12

Circuit has badly misunderstood what Franklin says.

It


13

doesn't cover punitive damages.

14

matter.

15

the plaintiff in Franklin, but more to the point, the


16

premise of Franklin against Gwinnett County was drawn from


17

Bell against Hood and the cases that underlie Bell against


18

Hood, and that is an explicitory, compensatory rationale. 


19

The idea in Bell was that courts have an authority --


That's the short of the


Punitive damages were, after all, not sought by


Explicitory? 


20

QUESTION:

21

(Laughter.) 


22

MR. ROBBINS:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ROBBINS:

25

(Laughter.) 


I'm sorry? 


Did you say explicitory? 

Good heavens, I hope not. 


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

2

(Laughter.) 


3

MR. ROBBINS:

It's good. 


I like it though.

Well, what -- what I certainly


4

meant to say is that Bell and Hood stem from a line of


5

authority that says that courts have the authority, the


6

inherent authority I -- I had meant to say, when -- when


7

charged with the construction of a statute to make good


8

the wrong done.

9

a compensatory rationale as you could have. 


10

And that is about as clear a statement of


Franklin did not suggest that a plaintiff who


11

has been made whole, as Mr. Gorman was to the tune of $1


12

million in compensatory damages, including $150,000 in


13

pain and suffering, has a right inferable through a


14

statute that speaks not a word to the matter, to an


15

additional presumption of punishment. 


16

QUESTION:

Well, did the compensatory damages in


17

this case include damages for humiliation, or am I wrong


18

about that? 


19
20
21

MR. ROBBINS:

I -- I do not -- I have not seen


an indication that it included that.
QUESTION:

I --


In -- in this -- is the jury


22

instructed in this jurisdiction that compensatory damages


23

include damages?

24

that also humiliation?

25

as part of the compensatory award. 


Of course, pain and suffering, but is

I thought humiliation was covered


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBBINS:

I -- we have included the


2

instruction, Justice Kennedy, at page 72 of the joint


3

appendix, and I do not find a specific reference to that. 


4

I'd be glad to see if I can --


5

QUESTION:

Well, I guess it -- it goes to the


6

make-whole point.

7

is not part of the compensatory award, could the argument


8

be made, well, in order to make the person whole, you must


9

give punitive damages because it includes damages for


10
11

Assume a jurisdiction where humiliation


humiliation?

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I guess I'd be inclined to


12

-- to think about that in a case in which somebody had


13

argued that below or here.


14

QUESTION:

But it wouldn't achieve that.


15

MR. ROBBINS:

16

QUESTION:

But -- but --


It wouldn't achieve that.

Would it,


17

Mr. Robbins?

18

you know -- you're telling the jury, punish this person if


19

you think he deserves punishment.

20

jury, by the way, humiliation damages are not available,


21

and therefore give this fellow as -- as much humiliation


22

damages, calling them punitive damages, as --


23

I mean, you -- you would not tell the jury,


QUESTION:

You're not telling the


But I want you to assume -- and I


24

believe this is the law in many jurisdictions -- that


25

punitive damages are given in part to ease the -- the --

1

it's smart money in order to ease the -- the pain that the


2

person suffers, et cetera. 


3

MR. ROBBINS:

Right.

I -- I don't want to


4

quarrel with the hypothetical, Justice Kennedy.

It may


5

very well be that pain and suffering already embraces that


6

concept.

7

compensable as a compensatory damages.

8

in the jurisdictions to which Your Honor adverts, punitive


9

damages are used to supplement a compensatory regime that


In many jurisdictions, pain and suffering is not

And it may be that


10

falls short of pain and suffering, which is not the case


11

here.

This man received $150,000 --

I understand.

MR. ROBBINS:

-- for the category called pain

15

suggestion that he wasn't made whole.


16

And there's no


The suggestion is that my clients should be


17

punished, and that is something as to which the statute


18

provides absolutely no --


19

QUESTION:

Well, that's true, but the statute


20

doesn't say specifically about whether to give an


21

injunction, about whether you could give a trademark


22

remedy.

23

the Court under Franklin -- I'm simply focusing you on


24

their main argument.

25

there either is an ordinary private right of action, et

it is, ordinarily.

And if there is, you take it as

3

MR. ROBBINS:

4

QUESTION:

Well --


Why should we divide up, in other


5

words -- there's this amount of the common law action, but


6

not that amount.

7

have the two-witness rule or the -- or the parol evidence

rule?

There's -- why -- how do we know that we

QUESTION:

Yes. 


-- that private people can bring. 


12

So, why separate out from that whole package suddenly


13

punitive damages?

14
15

That's --


MR. ROBBINS:
common law action.

This is a Federal statute --

All right. 


16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ROBBINS:

18

QUESTION:

19

Precisely because this is not a


-- as to which --


So, which one shall we separate out? 


Just punitives or what?


20

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, as to which Congress has


21

spoken.

It has adopted title VI remedies that are quite


22

robust, which come with title VI regulations that are


23

enormously detailed, freighted with due -- levels of due


24

process that are quite unusual.

25

overlay a punitive damages remedy that comes with none of


And yet, we propose to

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those protections.

2

to layer punitive damages on a regime like this.

3

not, after all, a question that is committed to the courts


4

like some of those doctrines.

5

may in some jurisdictions have originally been enacted or


6

not. 


7

It would work an extraordinary anomaly

This is


The parole evidence rule


But the fact is this is a statute, and Congress


8

spoke rather clearly to what it -- it wanted the statute


9

to accomplish.

And some of the things it expressly said


10

cannot live with the things that respondent proposes to


11

import into it. 


12

And let me just say one other thing, and I


13

noticed that my white light on, as -- I do want to reserve


14

some time for rebuttal. 


15

This is also a Spending Clause statute, and I


16

know this gets back to a -- a threshold issue that both


17

Your Honor and Justice Ginsburg suggested perhaps the


18

Court could pretermit.

19

given that the task is to construe the statute, to ignore


20

the fact that it was enacted pursuant to a contractual


21

regime in which punitive damages historically and for a


22

variety of sensible reasons are especially inappropriate. 


23

And if there are no questions, I -- I would like


24
25

I think it would be a mistake,


to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal. 

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Robbins.

Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you.


2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE


3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


4

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


5

MR. GARRE:

The statutes at issue in this case,


6

section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and title II of the


7

ADA, do not sanction the award of punitive damages which


8

are, by their definition, damages in excess of that


9

necessary to make good any wrong done. 


10

Now, there are several -- both section 504 and


11

title II derive their remedies expressly from title VI of


12

the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which operates as a


13

condition on the receipt of Federal financial assistance. 


14

And it seems to me that -- to us that there are several


15

facets of the title VI statutory scheme which make it


16

particularly inappropriate to infer a punitive damages


17

remedy.


18

The first is, is that title VI, although it's


19

silent with respect to a compensatory remedy, expressly


20

provides for punitive and regulatory measures in the event


21

that the violation of its nondiscrimination provision.

22

particular, the statute provides for a termination of


23

Federal funding, which this Court has itself recognized is


24

a very severe -- severe remedy that can have a powerful


25

deterrent effect. 

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

In


1

In addition, the statute authorizes


2

administrative enforcement actions, actions that -- in


3

which the regulatory agencies, who have responsibility for


4

enforcing section 504 and title II, can take remedial


5

action, order remedial action, short of funding


6

termination. 


7

Now, the second aspect of title VI and title VI


8

statutory scheme it seems to us to be quite pertinent is


9

that punitive damages are themselves antithetical to


10

Spending Clause legislation like title VI because the


11

availability of unbounded punitive damages awards can


12

actually have the effect of diverting resources from


13

achieving the important objectives of the underlying


14

spending programs. 


15

QUESTION:

Tell me.

I just can't recall.

Have


16

we held that punitive damages are available on the Bivens


17

action?


18

MR. GARRE:

We think the Court addressed that in


19

passing in the Carlson v. Green case, and we think that


20

that -- the discussion of punitive damages in that case is


21

properly regarded as -- as dictum in that case.

22

but --


23

QUESTION:

But --


So, do -- do I infer from your --


24

from your response that it is the position of the


25

Department that punitive damages should not be awarded in

Bivens cases? 


2

MR. GARRE:

3

between Bivens and this case. 


4

Yes, but there are two distinctions


First, in the Bivens context, there aren't


5

statutory penal and regulatory measures that can be used


6

like funding termination or administrative enforcement


7

actions to take deterrence measures when -- when needed to


8

deter violations. 


9

And second, in the Bivens context, this Court is


10

giving effect to a constitutional tort that it alone has


11

recognized.

12

purporting to ascertain Congress's intent in enacting


13

section 504 in title II.


14
15

In -- in this context, the Court is


QUESTION:

What about 1983?

This Court has said


that punitive damages are available. 


16

MR. GARRE:

That -- that's correct, Justice


17

Ginsburg.

And -- and first of all, if I can make two


18

points -- first, in that context, again, there is no


19

express statutory penal or regulatory measures that


20

Congress created to provide deterrence as it did under


21

title VI, the remedies at issue in this case. 


22

And secondly, what's important, we think, about


23

the Smith case, in which this Court recognized a punitive


24

damages remedy under section 1983 -- is that in that case,


25

the Court didn't start with the presumption that punitive

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

damages were available and simply look to see if Congress


2

had said otherwise.

3

court of appeals applied in this case. 


And that's the presumption that the


4

Instead, the Court purported to engage in an


5

inquiry of Congress's intent and -- and focused on the


6

fact that when -- when Congress enacted section 1983, it


7

made very clear that it was adopting a special species of


8

tort liability looking to the -- the State common law at


9

the time which provided for punitive damages there.

So,


10

we think that the section 1983 case is quite different


11

than this case.

12

The Court --


QUESTION:

But you -- and you rely on the heavy


13

gun in statutes like title VI, title IX.

14

is so heavy that it's never used.

15

that we will hear tomorrow, the statement was made, well,


16

yes, it would be a drastic sanction to withdraw Federal


17

funds, but in 30 years it hasn't happened.


18

MR. GARRE:

That heavy gun


I mean, in the case


Well, first of all, it does happen. 


19

It happened in the Grove City case that came here, and I


20

could point Your Honor to additional examples in which the


21

termination funding mechanism has been used.

22

sure, it -- it's an unusual remedy and it's a harsh


23

remedy, and simply because it's not used in more cases


24

doesn't mean that it doesn't have a deterrent effect. 


25

QUESTION:

Now, to be


Under the Rehabilitation Act, it has

19

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been used under 504? 


2

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

I could point you to -- to one


3

case.

It's -- it's not a case cited in the brief.

4

court of appeals case, Freeman v. Cavassos, 939 F.2d.


5

1527, which is one example. 


6

It's a


But -- but again, the -- the Federal Government


7

-- Congress gave the Federal Government and the Federal


8

agencies authority to enforce these provisions short of


9

funding termination.

The -- the agencies receive


10

thousands of complaints each year under title II and


11

section 504.

12

commeasurate with the seriousness of the allegations


13

raised in those complaints, and they are successful in


14

negotiating compliance agreements, ranging from informal


15

agreements to formal settlement agreements, in which those


16

alleged to -- to have engaged in discrimination agree to


17

take corrective measures to eliminate discrimination and,


18

in some cases, to pay monetary sums. 


19

And they investigate those complaints


Now, the -- the Federal agencies have entered


20

into more 300 of those agreements under title II alone in


21

the past 8 years.

22

in place.

23

Congress, and we think that that process itself counsels


24

heavily against judicial inference of punitive damages.


25

So, there is an administrative process


It's statutory -- statutorily created by


Or in addition, to return to the -- the Court's

1

Franklin case, the Franklin case is grounded on the notion


2

that the Federal courts have the authority to provide a


3

remedy when necessary to make good the wrong done.

4

principle has no application to and has never been


5

extended to punitive damages.

6

for this Court to extend the Franklin principle to


7

punitive damages.

That


It would be a quantum leap


Punitive damages, the Court has recognized, are

devastating effect.

damages make them uniquely suited for careful legislative

judgment.

be available, and therefore, this Court should reverse the

decision below.

Mr. Nelson, we'll hear from you.

23

Thank you, Mr. Garre.


ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. NELSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

This case presents the issue of whether Congress


24

foreclosed awards of punitive damages when it enacted the


25

rights of action to enforce section 504 of the

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Rehabilitation Act and title II of the ADA which together


2

prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities


3

in the provision of public services.


4

The text, structure, policies, and legislative


5

history of the ADA disclose no prohibition on the award of


6

punitive damages.

7

Absent such a prohibition --


QUESTION:

Well, if -- now that the Eleventh


8

Amendment immunity issue is gone, don't we have to deal


9

with City of Newport?


10

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think the answer to that,


11

Justice O'Connor, is no.

12

preserve the ability to argue for immunity on City of


13

Newport, they were free to do so in the lower courts.


14

QUESTION:

Had the defendants wished to


Well, do you say that we are


15

precluded from considering that authority as we resolve


16

this case? 


17

MR. NELSON:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. NELSON:

20

QUESTION:

25

-- you're precluded from it.

It's


No.

So, are you going to deal with


it then? 


23
24

No. 


-- it's a --


21
22

No, I don't say --


MR. NELSON:

Yes.

I -- I do intend to deal with


that. 

I'd like to start by dealing with -- with the

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

issue of whether there's a punitive damages remedy at all


2

because I think then the Newport issue really is secondary


3

to that. 


4

And the starting point with respect to the


5

availability of punitive damages I think has to be this


6

Court's decision in Franklin.

7

instead of looking at -- at arguments about what underlies


8

Franklin, to look at what Franklin said.

9

general rule, therefore, is that absent clear direction to


And it's useful I think to,


Quote:

"the


10

the contrary by Congress, the Federal courts have the


11

power to award any appropriate relief in a cognizable


12

cause of action brought pursuant to a Federal statute."


13
14

QUESTION:

Franklin wasn't dealing with punitive


damages, was it? 


15

MR. NELSON:

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice. 


16

Punitive damage was -- was not the form of relief that was


17

being addressed in Franklin.


18

QUESTION:

And appropriate relief does not sound


19

to me to be consistent with your beginning premise which


20

was that unless Congress forecloses the remedy, we must


21

give it. 


22

MR. NELSON:

Well, I certainly don't mean to say


23

that -- that in any particular case, the Court must give


24

it unless Congress forecloses it, but if Congress has not


25

foreclosed it, it's potentially available if, in view of

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the policies of -- of the particular statute, it's an


2

appropriate remedy and in view of the conduct that's being


3

addressed.

4

punitive damages are an appropriate remedy where there's


5

willful -- a willful violation or reckless disregard of --


6

of the legal entitlements of the plaintiff. 


7

Specifically, under this Court's decisions,


QUESTION:

Well, what do you make of the -- the


8

argument that the whole touchstone for damages here is


9

504, which is essentially the -- the spending power -- the


10

-- the -- a statute resting on the spending power?

11

closest analogy to that is with contract, and you don't


12

get punitive damages from contract. 


13

MR. NELSON:

The


Well, there -- there are two


14

answers to that.

15

simply 504, but also the ADA, which is not a Spending


16

Clause enactment at all.

17
18
19

The first is that the touchstone is not


QUESTION:

The second is that --


But that referred to 504 for -- for


-- in effect, for its remedial scheme. 

MR. NELSON:

To the extent that -- that what it


20

-- what it says is that the remedies available, the


21

remedies being a private right of action -- and that does


22

not necessarily, however, import a limitation imposed on


23

that remedy from above by the Spending Clause that doesn't


24

inhere in the -- in the nature of the statute itself,


25

assuming that the Spending Clause does impose that

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

limitation, which I don't concede, and I'll get to in a


2

moment. 


3

But this Court actually addressed a similar


4

situation in the Darrone case.

The issue there was the


5

remedies available under section 504 for a case of


6

employment discrimination, and 504 in turn incorporates


7

the remedies available under title VI.

8

there is no remedy available for employment discrimination


9

under title VI except with regard to a Federal program


Title VI said


10

where the funding is for employment purposes.

11

said that by incorporating the title VI remedies, section


12

504 did not incorporate that limitation on the remedial


13

scheme that had nothing to do with the policies underlying


14

section 504 which were to eliminate discrimination against


15

the handicapped more broadly.


16

This Court


Similarly, under the Americans with Disabilities


17

Act, the -- the purpose of that act is to extend even


18

further than 504 the prohibition on and the remedies for


19

discrimination against persons with disabilities.

20

import into that statutory scheme a limit on relief that


21

-- that would pull it back and -- and restrict it to


22

what's appropriate on a Spending Clause measure would be


23

inappropriate under, I think, the mode of analysis this


24

Court used in Darrone. 


25

And to


But in any event, even if one looks only at

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

section 504, the Spending Clause analogy to contract


2

doesn't limit remedies available to contractual remedies. 


3

This Court I think made clear, both in Franklin and then


4

more recently in Davis v. Monroe County, that although the


5

obligation that an entity may undertake under the Spending


6

Clause is contractual in the sense that it's voluntary and


7

it has to be clearly stated what the substantive


8

requirements you're subjecting yourself to when you accept


9

Federal funding are, that that does not carry with it the


10
11

notion that you're limited to a, quote, "contract" remedy.

In Davis, what the plaintiff sought in her


12

complaint was punitive and compensatory damages for


13

injuries that had been inflicted on her.

14

was not a party to any contract.

15

quintessentially a tort recovery, and this Court held in


16

Davis that as long as the requirement that the conduct was


17

intentional, it was a violation that was -- that -- that a


18

person in authority had knowledge of and had -- had


19

allowed the situation to go forward, that if those


20

conditions, which were Spending Clause conditions under


21

the Gebser decision -- if those conditions were met, you


22

could go forward and obtain the type of tort remedial


23

relief that the plaintiff was --


24
25

QUESTION:

She, of course,


What she was seeking was


Well, you say -- you say she wasn't a


party to the contract.

She -- she was a beneficiary of

26

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the contract, surely.

2

MR. NELSON:

I mean --

Well, you could, I suppose,


3

analogize her to a third party beneficiary, but to suggest


4

that --


5

QUESTION:

6

tort actions.

7

as a tort action.

And contract actions were original


It's easy to characterize a contract action

Right?

8

MR. NELSON:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

It's just assumpsit.


Well, and in fact --

I -- I'm not sure a whole lot hangs


on --

MR. NELSON:

-- that -- that argument can go the


12

other way, too, because the States are broadly recognizing


13

that -- that malicious and bad faith breaches of contract


14

carry with them tort remedies.


15

But I'll give another example.

This Court in a


16

couple of decisions, Wright v. Roanoke Housing Authority,


17

and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, held that


18

under Spending Clause enactments, obligations can be


19

imposed on the recipients of funds that are enforceable


20

that create enforceable rights under section 1983.


21

And this Court has repeatedly held, most


22

recently I think in City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes,


23

that 1983 is ever and always a tort remedy.


24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. -- Mr. Nelson, why don't we look


specifically at this context, which is the ADA, and the

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

anomaly that when Congress thought about punitive damages,


2

as we know it did in the employment part, it provided for


3

them with qualifications and with caps on amount.

4

would be passing strange, would it not, that when Congress


5

is explicit about punitive damages, it contains them, and


6

it when it says not one word one way or another, they are


7

unlimited because that's -- as I take your argument to be,


8

under part 3, there are the caps and the qualifications,


9

but under part 2, it's public service, no limitation.


10

MR. NELSON:

So, it


It's under title I that the caps


11

apply, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that what that


12

illustrates is not -- not the point that -- that Congress


13

didn't intend to provide these remedies.

14

at -- at the timing of the enactments and the background


15

of those changes to the -- in the Civil Rights Act of


16

1991.


17

You have to look


As the ADA was originally enacted, title I,


18

consonant with title VII, didn't provide a damages remedy


19

of any kind.

20

legal forms of relief.

21

following the -- the title VII model. 


22

It didn't provide an entitlement to any

It was limited to equitable relief


No such limitation has ever been placed on title


23

II.

In title II, Congress simply incorporated by


24

reference an action for legal remedies that this Court had


25

already recognized to exist. 

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, then in 1991, Congress expanded the relief


2

under title I of the ADA, as well as under title VII of


3

the Civil Rights Act for the first time ever to allow a


4

damages remedy, either compensatory or punitive, for


5

employment discrimination to which those statutes applied.


6

And what that illustrates is simply the history


7

that Congress has been very wary about providing broad


8

damages remedies in the employment discrimination area and


9

in 1981, it relaxed that unwillingness to some degree, but


10

then placed a cap on it.

11

clear, from the original 1990 legislation, that Congress


12

didn't impose that circumscribed set of employment


13

discrimination remedies on title II.

14

title I, that doesn't either limit title II or imply that


15

title II was ever intended to be limited. 


16
17
18

QUESTION:

But in title II, it's quite


So, by expanding


Am I right that title III says no


punitive damages?

MR. NELSON:

Title III says no punitive damages


19

at all as part of a -- of a remedial scheme that is


20

similarly circumscribed to -- to title I, although in


21

somewhat different ways, a remedial scheme that under


22

title III doesn't make a private right of action for


23

damages of any kind available to an individual plaintiff. 


24

Under title III, it's only the Attorney General who can


25

ever sue for any damages, and then when Congress -- it --

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

having made a -- a damages remedy available to the


2

Attorney General, it then went on to say, and under this


3

statute, damages doesn't include punitive damages.


4

I think to the extent that sheds any light on


5

title II at all, we know that in title II, Congress knew


6

that it was creating a damages remedy.

7

limit those damages, as it did in title III, when it


8

created that limited damages remedy through the Attorney


9

General, is, if anything, an indication that no limitation


10

That it didn't


was intended.


11

QUESTION:

Why?

Why?

Because -- why -- why


12

would somebody want to -- title II has to do with actions


13

against a government basically, doesn't it? 


14

MR. NELSON:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So -- so, I thought punitives are


16

primarily designed to compensate an individual who's not


17

going to be compensated.

18

very big club against the people who behaved badly.


19

MR. NELSON:

20

QUESTION:

It's just a way of wielding a


Well --

Now, why would you want that big club


21

to be wielded against private people in limited amounts,


22

but when you get to a government which, after all,


23

represents the entire public, you say the sky is the


24

limit?

25

involved it's less reasonable to assess punitives than


Newport would suggest where the government is


30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

where a private individual is. 


2

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think the -- part of the


3

answer to that is the whole structure of the ADA remedial


4

scheme indicates an intention to make broader remedies


5

available against public entities than private entities to


6

begin with.

7

enacted, there were all these limits placed on title III,


8

no compensatory damages even, limits on title I against


9

private and public employers, not even any compensatory


That's why, when the ADA was originally


10

damages.

11

Congress made available a remedy there that is much more


12

extensive than it made against private employers or


13

private offerors of public accommodations.


14

Clearly, in title II, everyone agrees that


Now, why Congress did that I think is -- is


15

perhaps somewhat obscure, but it seems to relate back to


16

the entire history, starting with the 1964 Civil Rights


17

Act, where Congress was very hesitant about imposing broad


18

remedies against private actors, possibly in part due to


19

the -- the effectiveness of their lobbyists, which --


20

which may have been greater in this instance than those of


21

-- of public employers and entities. 


22

But for whatever reason Congress did it, it's


23

clear that Congress did enact broader remedies under title


24

II than under those titles that are applicable to --


25

QUESTION:

But that's an anomaly too because in

31

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

title -- title III, which is the -- the title that imposes


2

-- title I is the one -- employment.

3

MR. NELSON:

4

QUESTION:

5

Right? 


Correct. 

And are government employers liable


for punitive damages under title I?


6

MR. NELSON:

7

QUESTION:

No, they are not. 

So, your -- your notion that -- that


8

the government is not well representative in the


9

legislature -- here is a title that says, private sector,


10

you're going to be stuck.

11

punitive damages, but not government entities.


12

MR. NELSON:

You're going to be subject to


Well, that -- that was -- that was


13

what happened in the 1991 round.

14

Congress there obviously did made -- make a considered


15

choice not to impose those remedies on -- on public


16

actors.


17

Presumably the -- the


But I think, you know, to step back even


18

further, one has to look at the fact that both section


19

504, by virtue of the 1986 Rehabilitation Act amendments,


20

and the ADA, by virtue of -- of section 502, are subject


21

as a general rule to the principle that -- that Congress


22

very deliberately said public entities, and in particular


23

States, are going to be subject to the full range of


24

remedies that are available against private defendants. 


25

Congress did that explicitly in both those -- both those

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statutes.


2

And I think what that indicates is that there


3

has been a considered judgment in these statutes that,


4

especially in the area of the provision of public


5

services, Congress wants broad remedies to be made


6

available against the public entities that are subject to


7

it.

8

1991 when it extended the -- the remedies for employment


9

discrimination.

It's true that Congress made a different judgment in


But except for that provision of the


10

statute where public employers were given a special


11

exemption, the rest of the statute evinces an -- an


12

intention by Congress that public entities not get special


13

exemptions. 


14
15
16

QUESTION:

But doesn't that seem rather


perverse?

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think it -- it seems -- it


17

seems to me that -- that one can look at it either way. 


18

It's perverse if you're a public entity; it's not perverse


19

if you're a business entity that feels like anti-


20

discrimination laws trench on the -- the freedom of


21

businesses to operate in the way they want to operate.


22

I think what Congress has done with respect to


23

discrimination against persons with disabilities, first in


24

making the 504 remedies available against recipients of


25

Federal funds, and then in making the title II remedies

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

available against public entities, is -- is Congress has


2

made a judgment that says, we think discrimination against


3

persons with disabilities is particularly objectionable


4

when engaged in by the government, just as in the


5

fourth --


6

QUESTION:

But -- but your -- your Newport case


7

certainly suggests that traditionally public entities are


8

treated differently than private entities for the same


9

conduct if you're talking about punitive damages.


10

MR. NELSON:

That's certainly true.

And -- and


11

what I think is distinctive about Newport, to begin with,


12

here I do believe that -- that if the Court were to


13

considered that under these statutes there is a punitive


14

damages remedy available generally, and then the question


15

is should these particular defendants be freed from it


16

under a City of Newport rationale, that -- that it's fair


17

for this Court to hold the -- the defendant to the rule


18

that it generally applies, which is that if you want to


19

argue something like that, raise an issue like that, you


20

should do it in the lower courts. 


21
22
23

But even looking beyond that, what we have in --

in these statutes is in the --

QUESTION:

About the issue, are you -- are you


24

suggesting that it is not included in the question


25

presented?

MR. NELSON:

No, I'm not making that argument. 

Then -- then did you in your brief in

opposition point out that this was not properly raised in

the lower courts?

QUESTION:

Yes, that was pointed out in the


I want to be sure you -- suppose that


8

we did look at the Newport issue.

9

should, but suppose we did.

I'm not saying that we


And suppose that you lost on


10

your point that it should be waived or deemed waived. 


11

What would your -- is there any response to their claim on


12

the merits that -- that Newport makes clear that they are


13

not liable in punitive damages?


14

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

I think -- I think that --


15

that the first response is that through the Rehabilitation


16

Act amendments of 1986, which are codified at 42 U.S.C.,


17

section 2000(d)(7), and also in section 502 of the ADA,


18

which is codified at 42 U.S.C., section 12202, those


19

provisions are fundamentally incompatible with the notion


20

of Newport immunity.


21

And I want to just start by expressing my


22

understanding of what Newport immunity is in light of this


23

Court's decision in -- in the Vermont Natural Resources


24

case.

25

immunity.

It's not specifically an immunity that is municipal

It's an immunity or a -- or a general

1

presumption against awards of punitive damages against


2

State and local governments as a class.

3

it says where it operates is that those defendants as a


4

class have an exemption against a particular form of


5

relief that is otherwise available against private actors.


6

And -- and what


In the Rehabilitation Act amendments and in


7

section 502 of the ADA, what Congress said expressly is


8

that as to remedies against States, which are one of the


9

entities entitled to the Newport presumption, they're


10

subject to the same remedies under the statutes as are any


11

other private or public entities, meaning if you can get


12

it against a private entity, you can get it against a


13

State.

14

Newport, which is that governmental entities as a class


15

are entitled to a special exemption.

16

say is that governmental entities as a class are entitled


17

to no special exemption.

18

think simply goes away. 


And that takes away the fundamental premise of


What these statutes


And the City of Newport issue I


19

I'd also suggest that one of the fundamental


20

premises of City of Newport is not present under these


21

statutes, and that is that there's an adequate alternative


22

deterrent.

23

about when we're talking about punitive damages as a


24

deterrent, to answer Justice Kennedy's question earlier of


25

Mr. Robbins, in this case the compensatory damages award


And -- and in this case, what we're talking


36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

did include pain, suffering, humiliation, and mental


2

damages.

3

here as a surrogate for some component of compensatories. 


4

We're talking about it as a remedy designed to provide a


5

deterrent that will assist in -- in Congress's goal of


6

eliminating discrimination against persons with


7

disabilities.


8
9

So, we're not talking about punitive damages


And in -- in Newport, this Court looked at the

1983 remedy and said, yes, punitive damages are an


10

important element of deterrence with respect to civil


11

rights violations that are subject to section 1983.

12

we have a better deterrent which is the availability of


13

punitive damages against individual defendants who


14

actually make the decisions to carry out the -- the


15

wrongful acts that 1983 is responding to.

16

that judgment is -- as to which is more effective, is


17

correct or not, that's the line the Court drew in Newport.


18

But


Now, whether


But under these statutes, that remedy is not


19

available because section 504 and title II of the ADA make


20

quite clear that they provide remedies only against the


21

entities.

22

individual under title II of the ADA or under section 504


23

of the Rehabilitation Act.

24

statutes, deterrence against the entity is all you've got


25

and all you can rely on.


There's no right of action against a -- an


So, with respect to these


37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And that's yet another reason why Newport's


2

policies are inapplicable here.

And Newport was very


3

clear that beyond looking at the immunity, as -- as it


4

used the term, of municipalities as a -- as a sort of


5

standard to try to determine what the legislature was


6

thinking about when it enacted the statute, the Court was


7

also going to look at the policies of the particular


8

statutes to determine whether or not immunity from


9

punitive damages accorded with those policies.

And given


10

the distinctions between the ADA and section 504, those


11

policies are not served here by immunizing the -- the


12

defendants against punitive damages on -- under a Newport


13

rationale. 


14

I'd also like to get back for a moment, if I


15

could, to the -- the notion that what's going on in


16

Franklin is limited to compensatory remedies and that --


17

that the idea of -- of punitive damages as one of the


18

normal modes of relief offered by the Federal courts is


19

not really what the Court was talking about in Franklin. 


20

I think that's inconsistent not only with Bivens where in


21

Carlson v. Green this Court, I think, held that punitive


22

damages are available in Bivens actions because, as one of


23

the ordinary remedial mechanisms available to the Federal


24

courts, they were particularly appropriate for the redress


25

of constitutional violations.

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The reason I say that that's a holding is the


2

issue in Carlson was not whether there was a -- a right of


3

action for any relief at all under the Eighth Amendment. 


4

It was conceded that -- that the plaintiff could get


5

injunctive relief against an Eighth Amendment violation if


6

there was a pervasive --


7

QUESTION:

Mr. Nelson, last year in -- in the


8

Alexander case and this year in the Malesko case, we've


9

indicated that we're taking a much more critical look, I


10

think, at these kind of claims than we ever did in


11

Carlson.


12

MR. NELSON:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't


13

think that that's -- that that's quite right with respect


14

to -- with respect to the evolution of this Court's


15

doctrine.

16

particular in Sandoval, was that -- that the Court had


17

backed away from the notion that for every right, there


18

has to be a remedy and had gone to the -- the Court v. Ash


19

notion, that what we're looking for when we're trying to


20

determine whether a right of action exists is


21

congressional intent.


22

I think what the Court said, in -- in


But that was true at the time of -- of Franklin


23

as well and the Court in Franklin said that's a separate


24

question from what relief you get when it's conceded that


25

there is a right of action to begin with. 

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And similarly, in Malesko, this Court said,


2

we're not going to recognize a right of action against


3

this particular entity.

4

that Congress has made a right of action available, as it


5

is here, and what form of relief is appropriate, is a


6

different matter. 


7

QUESTION:

The question, when it's clear


Well, but what -- what you're arguing


8

basically is that every one of these things is fixed in


9

time permanently not just as to its holding, but as -- as


10

to language in it.

11

that is not always necessarily so, that the Court may take


12

a slightly different view some -- now than it did 10 years


13

ago.


14

And what I'm trying to suggest is that


MR. NELSON:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think


15

that's clearly -- that's clearly true.

16

that -- that we as -- as lawyers are trying to -- to deal


17

with is -- is how, in light of changes in precedent and --


18

and changes in evolution of the Court's doctrine over


19

time, what aspects can we pull out and -- and hold


20

constant or -- or use to make arguments as to what the


21

rule remains. 


22

And the question


And to me, looking at Franklin, which was a case


23

that -- first of all, all nine Justices concurred in the


24

holding at the time.

25

this Court had already evolved far away from the every


Second, it came at a point where


40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

right must have a remedy doctrine and was looking very


2

specifically at whether or not Congress had intended to


3

allow a right of action.

4

Court said and even the concurrence said was when it's


5

crystal clear that Congress said there's a right of action


6

here, does -- do we infer limits on our ability to provide


7

appropriate relief when Congress hasn't given us guidance


8

on that subject? 


9

QUESTION:

But what the opinion for the


And didn't say anything about whether


10

punitives would be appropriate relief because all Franklin


11

involved was compensatory damages.

12

thought that there were no compensatory damages under


13

spending statutes.

14

appropriate relief.

15

under Franklin punitive damages would be appropriate. 


16

Before that, it was


To clarify that, they used the phrase


MR. NELSON:

So, we've never had any holding that


That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 


17

On the other hand, the Court has certainly held that


18

punitive damages are appropriate in implied statutory


19

rights of action, the most notable being section 1981


20

which, unlike section 1983, is an implied right of action. 


21

Section 1981 doesn't say anything about creating a right


22

for anybody to go in and get enforcement, and the Court


23

has held not only is there a right of action there, but


24

held as recently as the Pollard case, which I believe was


25

last year, that under 1981 the scope of relief includes

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

punitive damages. 


2

I think that what that reflects is the Franklin


3

principle, that when there's a cause of action, when it's


4

a cause of action such as these, that is, essentially a


5

tort remedy, that the traditional range of relief that's


6

appropriate for such rights is provided.

7

of relief includes punitive damages.


8

And that range


And -- and again, the issue in this case is not


9

whether on the facts punitive damages are appropriate,


10

because that hasn't yet been decided, but whether ever


11

punitive damages are appropriate under this statute.

12

I think Franklin speaks to the question not in its express


13

holding but its rationale which -- which I believe has


14

survived down to the present. 


15
16

And


Unless there are any further questions, I will

leave it at that. 

Thank you, Mr. Nelson.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS


20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


21

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


22

Let me turn -- go back for just a moment to the


23

1991 act because I think its -- its significance here is


24

terribly important and quite a bit different from


25

respondent's characterization. 

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The 1991 act amended title I of the ADA and also


2

the Rehabilitation Act to provide a capped punitive


3

damages remedy available only to -- only to


4

nongovernmental entities.

5

uncapped award, indeed an award four times the size of the


6

cap, applied only to governmental entities and not in an


7

employment setting.

8

It is, I think, completely implausible for reasons that I


9

think go beyond what -- what Mr. Nelson has described to

This case obviously involves an

you.

The fact is title I was enacted in its original


12

form at the very same time that Congress was considering


13

the 1991 legislation.

14

they enacted in title I that there shall be the same


15

remedies as title VII -- everyone knew that at that very


16

moment laying before another committee in Congress was the


17

very legislation that is being characterized as the 1991


18

legislation, as if it happened much later.

19

simultaneously and everyone knew that punitive damages


20

were around the corner.

21

Mr. Nelson called the timing of the enactments, you really


22

have to read title I as if it enacted a punitive damages


23

and capped and targeted and calibrated.


24
25

Everyone in Congress knew that when


These happened


In my view, when you look at what


Title III also has a penalty provision. 

Although it forbids punitive damages, to go back to

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Ginsburg's question, it has a civil penalties


2

provision.

3

respondent's position and the position you would be urged


4

to adopt is that although title I of the ADA has a limited


5

punitive damages provision applicable only to employment


6

cases and exempting the government, and although title III


7

has a civil penalties provision applicable only to public


8

accommodations, title II, which is silent, shall have an


9

unlimited punitive damages provision which can be applied


So, the thing that is remarkable about


10

against governmental entities.

11

governmental entities and only governmental entities that


12

title II applies. 


13

And it is against


And City of Newport, I should add, doesn't


14

change just how anomalous that is.

15

amendments go not one step in the direction of overturning


16

City of Newport.

17

only this, that the States shall be liable for whatever


18

remedies are applicable to other public entities or


19

private entities.

20

and in our view punitive damages aren't available against


21

anybody under title II.

22

respondent's position to say that there shall be


23

applicable to the States whatever is applicable to anyone


24

else. 


25

The Rehabilitation Act


The Rehabilitation Act amendments say

Let me -- let me end with this point.

And we

haven't -- we haven't mentioned the history of judicial


8

interpretation of title VI and section 504, which had

never -- never, not once -- ever been construed to permit

punitive damages at any of the times in history that these


11

statutes were meticulously amended and -- and previous

remedy provisions incorporated going forward.
