ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. MCKENNA

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. MCKENNA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

Washington law authorizes union security

13

agreements which permit unions to enter into collective

14

bargaining agreements that require non-member employees

15

to pay an agency shop fee or lose their job.

16

union's authority to select these compelled fees is

17

based solely on statute and the subject of statutory

18

conditions.

19

voters in 1992, requires unions to obtain the

20

affirmative consent from non-members before their fees

21

may be used to influence an election or operate a

22

political committee.

23

election integrity by means of ensuring that union

24

election activity is funded by voluntary contributions,

25

just like every other organization that seeks political

The

funds.

760 is a valid condition on the union statutory

2

authority and does not violate the union's First

3

Amendment rights.

4

760 serves the state's interests specified

5

in the adopted initiative, which were -- which are found

6

at petition appendix 138a codified as RCW 4217.620.

7

Three interests in election integrity are stated, or

8

three means of serving an interest in election integrity

9

are stated in this portion, the intent portion of the

10

statute.

11

First, to ensure that individuals have a

12

fair and equal opportunity to influence elections;

13

second, to reduce the influence of large organizational

14

contributors; third, to restore public trust in the

15

election process.

16

petition appendix 22a-23a, agreed that the intent of

17

Initiative 134 was to protect the integrity of the

18

election process from the perception that individuals

19

have an insignificant role to play.

MR. MCKENNA:

They simply hold, Your Honor,

How do they know that?
I don't know how they know it,

Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

If that's what they

8

intended, then how can a State say, well, it's the

9

union's money, we don't want you to send this little bit

10

of your money to contribute in a campaign, but if the

11

local swimming team wants to, or the bar association or

12

the corporation, if they want to spend money that people

13

have given them for totally other purposes, the

14

compulsory bar association, well, they can do that.

15

It's just the labor unions that can't spend the money

16

that these people forced to belong -- you know, they

17

have to object affirmatively -- but all the other

18

similar organizations, they can't.

19

MR. MCKENNA:

Your Honor, beginning with the

20

Railway Labor Act case and continuing up through the

21

public school teacher cases, Abood and Hudson, this

22

Court has recognized that compelling employees to pay

23

fees must be balanced against the need to protect them

24

from -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, now you're talking
6


Alderson Reporting Company

about this other purpose, but that other purpose, which

2

is rather interesting -- I take it that's one of the

3

main points on the other side -- the other purpose has

nothing to do with this case.

5

have a similar statute where it was worried about

6

protecting the interests of the compelled member or the

case.

That isn't this case.

about that.

Solicitor General has pointed out in numerous briefs -

Federal statute and this is a State statute.

5

State court says, we're interested in purposes, we

6

decided, and you must as a matter of State law interpret

7

the statute according to the purpose as we found it,

8

aren't we bound by that?

MR. MCKENNA:

by that, Your Honor.

16

but to have made an assessment of its practical effects,

17

and this Court found it was not bound.

Teller, a case more directly relevant to this case, the

19

State Supreme Court found that the Bar Association of

20

California is a governmental agency and this Court

22

and found that in fact it was not.

In that case the Wisconsin Supreme Court was

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Similarly in

Well, that's because the

characterization had a Federal consequence.
MR. MCKENNA:

Your Honor, I simply observed
9


Alderson Reporting Company

that this Court did not find it was bound by the

2

California Supreme Court's finding that the bar

3

association is a government agency, nor did it find in

4

Wisconsin v. Mitchell that it was bound by the Wisconsin

5

Supreme Court in regards to its assessment of practical

6

effects of the Wisconsin statute at issue there.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do they get their money

8

back?

If this is upheld and I'm an agency member, I

9

hate the union, can't stand it, gave them the $20 for

10

this and they spent it on a political candidate I hate

11

even more and you win, do I get my $20 back or can the

12

union just spend my $20 on something else?

13

MR. MCKENNA:

Your Honor, if it is a 760

14

expense they should get the money back.

If it is a

15

non-760 expense which is not germane, then they would

16

have to opt out at that -- they would have to opt out to

17

get that kind of money back, unless Your Honor is

18

referring to what happens on, if the statute is upheld,

19

what happens when we go back and have a further trial on

20

the issues in this case.

21

you were envisioning, but -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure which scenario

I'm trying to get at the

23

question is this the union's money or is this the

24

workers', the teachers' money?

25

MR. MCKENNA:

Your Honor 10

Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So does he get this money

back if they violate the statute.

3

MR. MCKENNA:

Your Honor, the 760 money -

4

excuse me.

The 760 money is not the union's money until

5

they have satisfied the conditions laid out in the

6

statute, in this case Section 760.

7

fees does not entitle the WEA or any union to use those

8

fees to influence an election or operate a political

9

committee until after they have satisfied the condition

Possession of the

10

on that collection, the condition being in this case

11

they have to obtain affirmative authorization.

12

Court held in Phillipson and Brown that, analogizing to

13

that money, that non-members own the fees until the

14

statutory conditions are satisfied.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This

Let, let's assume that it

16

makes a difference whether the purpose of the statute

17

was at least in part to protect the First Amendment

18

rights of the non-union members or whether, as the

19

Washington Supreme Court seemed to say -- at least they

20

said its principal purpose was to protect the voting

21

process.

22

Washington Supreme Court says where a statute is

23

ambiguous and this court is able to construe it in a

24

manner which renders it constitutional the court is

25

obliged to do so, which sounds to me like good law.

Elsewhere in its opinion, however, the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Wouldn't that apply to its intuition as to what the

2

intent of the people who enacted this statute were?

3

MR. MCKENNA:

Yes, sir -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wouldn't the Washington

5

Supreme Court be obliged to intuit that purpose which

6

would make it constitutional rather than

7

unconstitutional?

8

MR. MCKENNA:

Yes, Your Honor, it would if

9

in fact Section 760 were ambiguous.

It is, however, not

ambiguous.

Supreme Court did not state that any term or phrase in

Do you agree with the

16

court's conclusion that constitutionality is at issue

17

here?

18

MR. MCKENNA:

The constitutionality of the

19

statute with regard to the union's First Amendment

20

rights is not at issue here, Your Honor, no.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Isn't it your position

22

that this statute is constitutional either way you

23

interpret it?

24
25

MR. MCKENNA:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

Your

Honor, I'd like to make the further point that -- and I
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think this is a fairly obvious point, but we think that

2

since under your decisions the State can prohibit a

3

union from collecting an agency fee altogether, that it

4

is reasonable for the State to impose a condition on

5

that collection which falls, falls far short of actually

6

prohibiting it.

7

case the Illinois statute at issue was effectively an

8

opt-in statute, a statute under which no amount that was

9

not germane could be collected in advance, unlike the

We further point out that in the Hudson

10

more generous Washington State statute which allows the

11

union, permits the union, to collect a fee in an amount

12

equal to dues or would permit it to collect a fee which

13

had been reduced in advance to reflect non-germane or

14

reduced just to reflect 760 expenses.

15

It seems to us that it is within the power

16

of the State to establish such a condition in the

17

interest of an election's integrity by means of

18

protecting the First Amendment interests of the

19

non-members, and we think the statute does that very

20

well without imposing in fact a substantial

21

administrative burden on the union in this case or

22

unions in general.

23

WEA or any union can comply with Section 760 would be to

24

simply place an additional form in the Hudson packet

25

they send out.

For example, the, the way that the

Now, recognizing that the Hudson packet
13
Alderson Reporting Company

2

in September, the busiest month of the year for

3

teachers, and that there is no form currently provided

4

in that packet whatsoever to allow people to opt out,

5

but rather a statement that you must send a letter to

6

the union to opt out, we think it's quite easy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL PAUL D. CLEMENT, ESQ.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

2

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

3
4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please the Court:

5

The statute at issue here imposes only a

6

narrow limitation on the union's use of agency fees,

7

namely by requiring the affirmative assent of the

8

non-members before the union may use those funds for

9

non- germane political expenditures.

The statute does

10

not limit the union's ability to spend its own money on

11

political causes and every avenue that is available to

12

any other organization in the State to solicit

13

contributions from non- members remains available to the

14

union.

15

The court below nonetheless struck the

16

statute down only by treating the workers' minimum

17

constitutional rights as a constitutional ceiling as

18

well as a floor.

19

rigidly constitutionalized an area of labor law in which

20

the States and the Federal Government have at least

21

since the Lochner era enjoyed substantial discretion to

22

make labor policy.

23

reverse the decision below, but also reverse and restore

24

room for play in the joints in this area of labor law.

25

In the process, the court below

We would request that the Court

I think the starting problem with the
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court's analysis below is that the rights that are at

2

issue in this area principally are the rights of the

3

individual workers.

4

agency shop itself raises significant First Amendment

5

issues and First Amendment impingements and so the

6

forced extraction of fees is justified only to the

7

extent that it can be justified by the government's

8

interest in maintaining labor peace or in avoiding free

9

ridership.

This court has recognized that

So as a minimum constitutional matter, the

10

workers have to have an opt- out right.

11

whether the States can go further and either do an

12

opt-in regime or do what was at issue in the Hudson case

13

and not even allow the union to collect the non-germane

14

funds in the first place from non-members.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The question is

Mr. Clement, if we reverse

16

as you suggest and the State Supreme Court said, well, I

17

guess we were wrong under the First Amendment, we just

18

realized our State constitution requires the same

19

result, would that judgment stand, do you think?

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think it might well.

I

21

mean, I think there might be an argument at that point

22

that somehow the Federal Constitution requires more than

23

opt-out rights.

24

that argument.

25

argument, and I suppose you could at that point confront

Certainly some of the amici have made
The Davenport Petitioners have made that

2

starting matter, I think that's an option that's

3

available to the Washington Supreme Court.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But at least as a

But Washington -- at a

5

minimum, I would assume that the Washington Supreme

6

Court would not have constitutional avoidance as a

7

crutch in order to reach that, to reach that conclusion,

8

because there is no constitutional issue here under your

9

view.

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Right, though I mean -- I

11

don't mean to be able to constrain the Washington

12

Supreme Court's ability to find a State constitutional

13

problem that it would then think there's a need to

14

avoid.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are the courts in

16

Washington State elected, do we know that?

17

elected?

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are they

They are elected.
They are elected, so it's

20

easier to blame it on us than it is for them to say, we

21

hold as a matter of Washington law that this can't be

22

done and we disallow what the people have voted for.

23

That would be harder, a harder call, don't you think?

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:
Justice Scalia.

It might be a harder call,

I seem to recall a reference -- it
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

might have actually been in the court of appeals opinion

2

rather than in the State Supreme Court opinion -- that

3

as a general matter the Washington courts have not

4

construed their First Amendment, State constituent First

5

Amendment to be radically different than the Federal

6

Constitution.

7

some State law that may limit their ability to do that.

8

I'm certainly not an expert on the Washington State law

9

of the First Amendment.

10

So I would imagine there's going to be

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if this money is the

11

non-union member's money and an opt-out -- I'm sorry -

12

opt-in scheme is not much of a burden on the unions, why

13

should the First Amendment permit anything other than an

14

opt-in scheme.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, it's a

16

fair question.

As I say, it's a question that's

17

certainly raised by the Davenport Petitioners.

18

there's an answer to it and I'll get to it in a minute.

19

But I would say in fairness to Mr. -- one of the

20

anomalies of this case is that in many respects I think

21

that's a more difficult constitutional question than the

22

one that the Washington Supreme Court answered adversely

23

to Petitioners in this case.

I think

24

I think, if I can sketch an answer as to why

25

it is that the opt out is the constitutional minimum and
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there isn't as a matter of constitutional law required

2

to be an opt-in right, I think it goes back to what the

3

Court has construed as the relevant First Amendment

4

interest here.

5

the relevant First Amendment interest here in not having

6

a compelled extraction, and as part and parcel of the

7

constitutional violation, it seems to have assumed

8

there's a need for a stated objection.

9

that's where you get the opt-out right.

10

And the Court has seemingly construed

And I think

And so if you put it in the analogy, an

11

analogous compelled speech context like Willie against

12

Maynard and the New Hampshire license plate, in that

13

context an important parcel of the violation is the

14

objection to having "Live Free or Die" on your license

15

plate.

16

speech there to be that everybody has a compelled speech

17

violation because they are presumptively forced to have

18

the license plate on the back of their car.

19

that -

20

And the Court hasn't construed the compelled

JUSTICE ALITO:

So I think

The union can make it as

21

difficult as it wants for somebody to opt out.

22

send a packet that's this thick and not provide a form.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

24

Alito.

25

questions, I would think.

They can

I wouldn't think so, Justice

And I think that there are two separate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

set of procedures and protections for exercising the

2

opt-out right?

3

do you actually have to go all the way to an opt-in

4

right?

5

where the Hudson notice that's provided doesn't provide

6

a sufficient constitutional opportunity.

7

have in a case like this, a 100-page packet, I'm told,

8

that has no -- no form in it that you're supposed to

9

return to opt out.

And then a separate question would be,

And I think that there may well be many cases

I mean, you

You basically have to go to the

10

third page, find the address of the president of the

11

union, and then send in a letter.

12

And I think it's instructive if you look in

13

the joint appendix, I think it's at page joint appendix

14

45, you have the form that's available to union members

15

to opt in to PAC contributions, and have payroll

16

deductions made for the PAC contributions.

17

certainly makes it much easier to opt in to PAC

18

contributions than it makes it to opt out vis a vis the

19

Hudson packet.

24

It seemed to be concerned with the integrity of the

25

election process, because they left the same old Hudson

in place for union nongermane spending that didn't have

2

to do with elections.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

That's absolutely right,

4

Justice Ginsburg, and I think the way we look at it is

5

that this whole debate about the purpose of the

6

provision is a little bit of a red herring, because at

7

the end of the day it's clearly a hybrid.

8

at the text, it's hard to understand how it does not

9

have at least the effect of protecting workers.

If you look

On the

10

other hand, you're absolutely right that it doesn't

11

address the entirety of germane, of non-germane

12

expenses.

13

direct impact on the election process.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16

It addressed a subset that have the most

Or even nongermane

political expenses.
MR. CLEMENT:

That's true.

That's true, I

17

mean, for example, a nongermane lobbying expense which

18

you might consider to be political in some broad sense,

19

is not covered by the opt-in and remains subject to the

20

Hudson opt out right.

21

But I don't think that there is certainly

22

anything problematic about that.

It's not like the

23

interest in protecting electoral integrity is some sort

24

of forbidden government interest that makes this a

25

suspicious piece of legislation.

And I think at the

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

end, if you again put the text of the relevant provision

2

together with the overall purpose, it's clear that it's

3

trying to protect the rights of workers but it's doing

4

so in service of a broader intent of improving electoral

5

integrity, and I could suggest where maybe the

6

Washington Supreme Court went awry in its analysis, it

7

focused almost exclusively on the three stated purposes

8

that were included in the text of Initiative 134, which

9

were all focused more on electoral integrity.

10

That's not surprising, because there were 36

11

sections in Initiative 134 that dealt with the whole

12

manner of different campaign finance initiatives.

13

Before this initiative was passed by the voters of

14

Washington there weren't any campaign contribution

15

limits in the State of Washington.

16

So this initiative is doing a lot more work,

17

just besides Section 760.

I think 760 isn't unrelated

18

to those broader purposes because it does make sure that

19

the contributions of the workers here are voluntary, and

20

I think that is certainly something that's very similar

21

to what Federal law accomplishes through the separate

22

segregated fund requirements.

23

If I could make just one note about the fact

24

that this targets unions and not other entities, I think

25

two points are relevant.

The first is that argument was
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

very clearly waived, and if you look at footnote 6 of

2

the Washington Supreme Court opinion which is at 25a of

3

the -- of the State's petition appendix, it's clear that

4

any argument about the, the disparate treatment of

5

unions versus corporations or other entities was not

6

before that court.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, are there any other

8

such entities that are given the power by the State to

9

collect money from people against their will?

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

You've anticipated my

11

second point, which is the power that's being -- I mean,

12

it's no accident that they targeted this particular

13

power or this particular issue because it has always

14

been understood to be an anomaly in this area.

15

unions have a right to effectively take a claim on the

16

paycheck on people who are nonmembers of the union.

17

These are individuals who have already opted out of

18

union membership, and that is a sufficient anomaly and

19

sufficiently unlike any other context that I think there

20

is nothing that prevents the State of Washington from

21

targeting that problem and that problem alone.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. WEST:

Thank you, Mr. Chief -- Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

5

Our submission that Section 760

6

unconstitutionally burdens the union's First Amendment

7

right to engage in political advocacy rests on three

8

points.

9

finance law that was enacted for the purpose of

One, the statute before the Court is a campaign

place.

restricting, restricting speech on ballot propositions

Uh, the First Amendment rights I mean, you -- you begin

by talking about the First Amendment but you, you

proceed as if there are no First Amendment rights of, of

2

workers involved at all.

3

MR. WEST:

The -- the -- the nonmember

4

employees certainly have a First Amendment right not to

5

be compelled to finance, help finance political,

6

ideological and other nongermane expenditures over their

7

objection.

8

independently of 760 by the Hudson process, and as the

14

And this is what the, what the First

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I take it States

have considerable discretion in determining how to

protect Federal constitutional rights.

17

MR. WEST:

The States -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And absent some direction

19

that we have to consider this as only being for a, for

20

purposes of election transparency, it seems to me that

Washington acted quite properly in saying we will use

22

this mechanism in order to protect our workers' First

23

Well, what the State is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

Well, why can't the State

The State -- from that it does not

follow that the State is not protecting the rights.

9

MR. WEST:

The State can certainly protect

10

the interest that is protected by the First Amendment

11

right more, or to a greater degree, but if it does so,

12

it can only do so if it does not infringe on other

13

constitutional rights.

14

is whether the State's regulation that infringes on

15

other constitutional rights, in this case the union's

16

First Amendment right of political advocacy, whether

17

that infringement is justified by a compelling State

18

interest.

19

And if it does then the question

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And your claim as I take

20

it, that there is an infringement with the union's right

21

of political advocacy, is that if in effect the scheme

22

restricts the union's use of its own funds?

MR. WEST:

24

of funds that are, are properly collected from agency

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

You agree that

2

the union could segregate these funds as opposed to

3

commingling them, and that would cure, that would in

4

effect answer your, your constitutional objection?

5

MR. WEST:

Well, it wouldn't, because then

6

the question is what do you do after you've segregated

7

them.

8
9

If the statute JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's clear from the

statute that, that what you would do would be leave them

10

subject to the opt-in determination, but all other

11

funds, i.e., the funds that you are constitutionally

12

entitled to protect, would be unencumbered.

13

MR. WEST:

Certainly Justice Souter, but

14

then the question is, for those fee payers, and

15

certainly there are going to be some out of three or

16

four thousand that do not give affirmative

17

authorization, then what do you do with their funds?

18

And the, the -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you think that would

20

create an independent constitutional problem assuming

21

that you did segregate the funds?

22

MR. WEST:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Justice Souter, the That would, that would

24

create an issue?

You know, what if they say:

that.

in effect would be, would be of equal parity with the

one that is, that is raised on behalf of the, the, the

5

But does that raise a constitutional problem that

MR. WEST:

Justice Souter, the reason it

6

raises a constitutional problem is because of the

7

content discrimination issue.

8

is that you have a right to collect an agency fee that

9

is the full equivalent of union dues, but if you choose

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's much harder on

the union, I would think, isn't it?

3

MR. WEST:

Well, it's much harder on the

4

union in that respect but not in the respect that's

5

critical here, and that is the Federal law as well as

6

the laws of all the other States who have, have required

7

separate segregated funds limit that requirement to

8

candidate elections.

9

The, the reason this statute is

10

unconstitutional, the reason it does not consist of a

11

compelling, does not provide a compelling governmental

12

interest in regulating elections, is because it goes far

13

beyond the permissible realm of regulating expenditures

14

on candidate elections, and prohibits the union without

15

affirmative authorization from spending its funds for

16

ballot propositions.

You're -- you're back to

its funds again.

19

MR. WEST:

Whether they're -

And you're saying, first

21

you said well, segregating the funds does not answer the

22

problem.

23

problem was that the, that it was, that the purposes of

24

the, of the act were underinclusive.

25

responding to Justice Ginsburg by going back to making

And I thought the reason it didn't answer the

29
Alderson Reporting Company

And now you're

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the assumption that the segregated funds would be the

2

union's funds.

3

MR. WEST:

Justice Souter, if they are

4

segregated, if the union segregates them, assuming they

5

don't -- for those for whom they don't receive

6

affirmative authorization, they keep them in escrow

7

indefinitely, or they put them in a locked box and never

8

do anything with them, certainly the union would satisfy

9

the statute in -- in that way.

10

But what, what the statute says as

11

interpreted by the trial court, if then the union puts

12

those funds back into its general treasury, or even if

13

it doesn't, and spends them in some way for some purpose

14

whatever, that it's violating the statute.

15

way that the union can comply is by not only segregating

16

the funds, but then if affirmative authorization is not

17

received, by rebating a certain portion of the fund to

18

the individual fee payers.

20

approach was exactly what we held was required in the

And that's -

and that's why I think that that interpretation of the

That brings us back to the

12

question I asked earlier and I suggested in my answer to

13

that I don't think it's content discrimination of the

14

sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government

15

gives money for a particular purpose only and not for

16

other purposes, and I also don't think it's content

17

discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny

18

when the government allows a private organization to use

19

governmental power to exact money from people for a

20

particular purpose only.

21

MR. WEST:

That's a different ball game.

Justice Scalia, imagine, if I may

22

take a little bit starker example, imagine that what the

23

government said in the statute that the union must

24

obtain affirmative authorization if it is going to use

25

agency fee funds to support Democratic candidates, but
44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

not if it's going to support Republican candidates.

2

Obviously it couldn't do that.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I see that you've put a

lot of weight on this argument.

5

MR. WEST:

And that -- it goes further than

6

this.

7

content discrimination and the Court has held in

8

Consolidated Edison and a number of other cases that

9

that is also a constitutional problem.

10

That's viewpoint discrimination.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But this is

What you're saying right

11

now, if it is, is ballots versus candidates under the

12

word "election."

13

MR. WEST:

Exactly.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that has a lot of

15

implications for all kinds of campaign finance law that

16

has nothing to do, I think, with unions.

17

MR. WEST:

Exactly.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the lower court didn't

consider it, and is this open now, if it's going back

for other things such as the State Constitution, for

them to consider this matter on remand?

I think it would be open to them

to consider.

I also think it's a matter that when we

2

in your favor here would have for Vermont's campaign

finance law or California's or some other.

4

MR. WEST:

Perhaps, but it's certainly true

5

that on this, at least on this point of the lack of any

6

compelling justification for restricting entities'

7

contributions and expenditures in support of or in

8

opposition to ballot propositions, the law, this Court's

9

law, is fully clearly on that point.

10

It's our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, that

11

what you have here is a content-based restriction on

12

WEA's ability to engage in political speech on issues of

13

educational policy that are of vital importance to the

14

70,000 teachers that it represents.

restriction requiring affirmative authorization for all

MR. WEST:

Yes.

If this were -

particularly if this were JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If this were across the

board as to all First Amendment rights an objecting

the statute that authorized the agency fee in the first

2

place.

3
4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, it's done in this

statute.

5

MR. WEST:

If it's done in this statute, the

6

problem that would remain, Justice Kennedy, is this is

7

an election law that presumably has to be justified on

8

the basis of whether it promotes the integrity of

9

elections.

10

And when you have JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, my hypothetical is

11

that there's a Washington statute or a Washington

12

constitutional referendum provision, initiative

provision, which says that as to all protected speech

14

for non- union members who have moneys taken out, there

15

must be affirmative authorization.

16

MR. WEST:

The State could do that, at least

17

if it limited it to the public sector, where the State

has the authority to authorize the amount of the agency
