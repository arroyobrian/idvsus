ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

We are here today because the Oregon court

12

failed to follow this Court's directions on remand and

13

because the ground it gave is not adequate to show a

14

forfeiture of due process rights.

15

This -- this Court vacated after finding

16

that the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong

17

constitutional standard, and it remanded with directions

18

to apply the standard that the Court laid out.

19

Oregon court didn't do that.

20

the constitutional issue.

21

refused to follow this Court's direction because it

22

believed there were mistakes in another paragraph in our

23

instruction request dealing with what the court referred

24

to as "unrelated issues."

25

But the

It never even addressed

The Oregon court, of course,

But that isn't what this Court mandated.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And the specific forfeiture theory adopted here for the

2

first time after nine years of appellate litigation is

3

completely inadequate to avoid this mandate.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shapiro, we are

5

dealing with a State supreme court, and our bottom line

6

always reads "for further proceedings not inconsistent

7

with this opinion."

8

State court can resolve a case on an alternate State law

9

ground, if there is such a ground in the case.

10

And it was my understanding that a

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe

11

that this disposition is quite inconsistent with what

12

the Court mandated.

13

case about the "correct in all respects" rule, but it

14

still mandated an application of the constitutional

15

standard, including the prohibition on punishment for

16

harm to non-parties, and that standard simply was never

17

applied.

18

opinion.

19

The Court heard arguments in this

We say that is inconsistent with this Court's

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it seems to me the

20

problem with the argument is that to say it is

21

inconsistent with the opinion we implicitly have to say

22

that the Oregon Supreme Court has to confront State law

23

issues in a certain sequence, and that if it does not do

24

so those issues are waived, as it were, not only by the

25

court but by the party who raised it.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difficulty, I think, with your position here is that on

2

the assumption, which I do make, that the -- that the

3

issue, "correct in all respect" issue, was properly

4

raised by the other side, if we accept your position, we

5

in effect are saying the other side is not going to have

6

an opportunity to argue that before the Oregon Supreme

7

Court.

8

for you to climb.

9

And that's, it seems to me, kind of a steep hill

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, we don't say that the

10

court can never adopt a State law standard after remand

11

from this Court, but we say that this disposition is

12

inconsistent -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I know you are saying that

14

but why -- why does the disposition that you are asking

15

for not entail what I just said, and that is, in effect

16

you cut off the claim by a party raised before the

17

Oregon Supreme Court, not considered by the Oregon

18

Supreme Court, and you cut off that claim simply because

19

the Oregon Supreme Court chose to approach the issues in

20

the case in a certain sequence?

21

have to do that?

22

MR. SHAPIRO:

What business do we

Well, because the preservation

23

issue was debated before this Court and it adopted a

24

specific order here saying on remand now consider the

25

constitutional standard, which is the prohibition on 5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I know the language that

you are referring to.

3

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the referring to that

5

language simply skips over the issue that I am trying to

6

raise.

7

concerned with if we accept your position in cutting off

8

the claim made by one party to the case which was never

9

heard by the Oregon Supreme Court?

Isn't there a problem that we should be

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, Your Honor, this is very

11

similar to what occurred in the Sullivan case in this

12

Court, where the issue of preservation was debated

13

before this Court at the cert stage in the cert papers,

14

and the Court said:

15

adequacy of the State ground when we CDRed the case.

16

We sub silentio passed on the

Would that have been an appropriate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disposition for the Oregon Supreme Court to make?

2

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, that takes us to our

3

second and principal argument, which is that that ground

4

would not be adequate under this Court's criteria for

5

adequacy.

6

reasons why that would not be an adequate ground for

7

forfeiting this constitutional right.

8

It was a surprise ruling that we couldn't anticipate.

9

It is an exercise in futility because, even if we

And we say that there are really three

It's an ambush.

10

submitted a perfect instruction that complied with that

11

rule, we would have been rejected anyway by the trial

12

court that simply believed that this instruction wasn't

13

required by the -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

that argument in the Oregon Supreme Court?

16
17

Isn't the place to make

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, no.

The Oregon Supreme

--

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Wouldn't it have been

19

appropriate to -- to hear the -- the issue that they are

20

raising and for you to make the reply that you have just

21

made?

22

MR. SHAPIRO:

Your Honor, this Court has

23

said repeatedly that adequacy is a Federal law question

24

for this Court to decide.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I realize it's a Federal
7


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

law question and in approaching that question, I keep

2

asking the question which I think I have now put to you

3

three times and have yet to hear an answer on the merits

4

on:

5

that cuts off the right of a party that properly raised

6

an issue in the Oregon Supreme Court and has yet to be

7

heard on the merits in the Oregon Supreme Court?

Why is it appropriate for us to have a rule here

8
9

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, there are two reasons.

First under the adequacy decisions of this Court,

10

including Lee v. Kemna, if it takes years and years

11

after the trial to articulate a forfeiture rule like

12

this that counts heavily against the adequacy of the

13

State ground.

14

recently.

15

This Court held that in Lee v. Kemna very

And then secondly, this is a point that was

16

argued to this Court four separate times now and when

17

the Court remanded with explicit directions to apply the

18

constitutional standard that's something that had to be

19

done on remand.

20

court to get into the question of whether this request

21

was made.

22

The Court did not invite the lower

The Court found that the request was made.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Maybe -- maybe this Court

23

insufficiently appreciated the significance of the issue

24

which is now before us.

25

there a good reason on the merits why it is fair for us

And I still want to know, is

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to cut off the right of the other side to raise an issue

2

that they raise or to argue an issue that they raised in

3

a timely fashion?

4

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, there is a good reason,

5

because this is -- adequacy is ultimately a Federal

6

question for this Court to decide.

7

debated here four separate times at great length.

8

Court remanded for a specific decision by the lower

9

court.

10
11
12
13

That wasn't done.

The issue was
The

And if we turn to the

adequacy doctrine JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

What -- what

issue was debated here four times?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Whether or not there was an

14

adequate State ground because of the "correct in all

15

respects" rule.

16

in the cert oppositions twice.

17

the cert opposition this time around.

18

never accepted it.

19
20

That was debated in the merits brief,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. SHAPIRO:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24
25

But the Court has

But the State court hadn't

ruled on it at that time.

21

23

It was debated again in

That's correct.
So how do we rule on it as

a matter of first impression?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, because, Your Honor, the

Court considered, just as it did in Sullivan, it
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

considered these issues in the cert papers and then

2

remanded the case for a different issue to be decided by

3

the lower court.

4
5

But we don't hesitate from debating the
adequacy issue.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did our opinion decide that

7

-- that question?

8

question was decided against your opponent?

9
10

Did our opinion say that that

MR. SHAPIRO:

No.

What the Court said in

Sullivan was that it was a sub silentio determination.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How could we have

12

determined it when the Oregon Supreme Court itself

13

hadn't made any determination?

14
15

MR. SHAPIRO:

Because the parties debated

this extensively in their briefs.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we don't decide

17

questions, particularly questions of State law, that may

18

have a Federal check.

19

first instance.

20

But we don't decide them in the

And there's one point, Mr. Shapiro, that I

21

think affects this concern of fairness to the parties

22

who raised this "correct in all respects" from the

23

beginning.

24

the Williams case itself, the rule about harm to others.

25

In State Farm we were talking about harm to

This Court had not clarified, had it, until

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

nonresidents.

So if I recall correctly, Williams was

2

the first time we ever clarified that harm to others

3

included people within the same State; is that correct?

4

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

That's true.

5

This -- this, as the Court expressed it, was

6

a slight extension of the previous decisions.

7

Honor, if the Court feel that this adequacy issue hasn't

8

been dealt with previously by this Court, it's presented

9

squarely here.

It is a Federal question, which this

10

Court says has to be decided by this Court.

11

don't hesitate from -

12

But Your

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And we

I suppose one reason

13

-- one reason to think it may not have been decided is

14

that, unlike the other situations you have discussed, it

15

would not have been a bar to our consideration of this

16

case the last time because, just as you raise the

17

question in your second question presented that whether

18

the award complies with due process, we may have thought

19

there might have been an adequate and independent State

20

ground on a procedural question, but we were going to go

21

ahead.

22

whether the damages award was unconstitutional.

23

We granted cert on the substantive question on

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, Your Honor, if -- if

24

we're not right about the decision resolving the

25

adequacy issue already, we're happy to turn to it now
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and address it as we do in our briefs.

2

adequate State ground under this Court's decisions.

3

first reason for that is that this is a futile gesture

4

that the State court requires of us.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This is not an
The

I want to ask you about

6

that.

That's the thrust of your argument:

It would

7

have been futile to comply with the specific, drafting a

8

perfect -- perfect instruction "correct in all

9

respects."

But I have to think the trial -- the record

10

is subject to the reading that the trial judge thought

11

the issue had already been adequately taken care of,

12

rather than it would be an incorrect instruction.

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the trial judge asked,

14

is there any authority that requires me to give this

15

instruction on harm to non-parties?

16

view it's the BMW case.

17

not an authority right on point I'm not going to give

18

this instruction.

20

no difference; and if we had taken out the two mistakes

21

--

And we said, in our

She said that very clearly.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So if we

Where in the record is the

23

portion of the colloquy about the instructions most

24

clearly stated in your view, on your side of that issue?

25

MR. SHAPIRO:

Let's see.
12

Alderson Reporting Company

It's the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

instruction conference.

2

Mr. Beaty starts discussing the second prong of this

3

paragraph.

judge -- the judge says:

covered by giving an instruction that punitive damages

6

are not compensatory."

7

not -- "That is not the point of this instruction."

8

This is pages 17 and 18a.

This begins on page 17a, where

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, no, that is

But that's exactly the

10

point I make.

11

think it's already covered, which is different from

12

saying, no matter how you phrase it, I won't give it.

13

I think the trial judge was saying, I

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, she said she just

14

disagreed with the idea that there should be protection

15

against punishment for harm to non-parties.

16

said unless there's a case requiring that, I'm not going

17

to give that instruction.

18

And she

And she said -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Didn't she also say that

19

she was going to give, and ultimately did give an

20

instruction, to the effect that punitive damages are

21

punitive, they are not for the compensation of this

22

person or any other person, and to -- she then turned to

23

Philip Morris's counsel and said:

24

Philip Morris's counsel said okay.

25

MR. SHAPIRO:

What about that?

What he was saying when he
13

said okay was:

2

going to continue to argue a point that I've already

3

lost.

4
5

I understand your ruling and I'm not

But he pressed that point JUSTICE SOUTER:

It doesn't sound like much

of an objection.

6

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, the -- the State courts

7

both held -- both of the appellate courts held our

8

instruction was rejected.

9

rejected, too, in its opinion.

And this Court said it was
And that's exactly

10

right.

11

and arguing after your position has been rejected.

12

You can't antagonize the trial judge by arguing

JUSTICE BREYER:

But -- but the -- the

13

problem that I am having at the moment is that they did

14

-- from your point of view, is that they -- the other

15

side listed 28 cases in which they said the Oregon

16

courts have followed this rule that the instruction has

17

to be good as a whole.

18

Now, I have looked up those 28 cases, and

19

they do -- they do say that.

They do say it, or they

20

imply it, or they apply it.

21

point, but they are not completely out of point, either.

22

And -- and so I suppose what happened is that the judge

23

there just looked at this instruction on 32(a).

24

looks like sort of it's all together.

25

look like it's all together, the (1) and the (2).

They are not completely on

It

It really does
And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

he ran his eye down the page and he said, well, here are

2

two other ways in which it's no good, and so that's the

3

end of it.

4

should have had four instructions instead of one, but

5

you did just have one.

6

You can't raise your objection.

Maybe you

And under Oregon law, unless every part of

7

it is right, the judge is correct in not giving it, even

8

if he never mentions the other part.

9

does seem as if that's what those 28 cases do say.

10
11

And that 28 -- it
So

what do we say about that?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The -- the reason we say that

12

those 28 cases did not give us reasonable notice that we

13

had to submit a separate piece of paper or change

14

another paragraph in the instruction request is that

15

none of them dealt with a situation where you have

16

separately numbered requests -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I mean -- please, I

18

-- I don't want to appear skeptical, but I am.

19

and that's because I have looked up in some of those

20

cases, and then I sort of looked at the -- which doesn't

21

-- most of them don't give you the instructions, so it's

22

a little hard to say.

23

of this appendix and looked at what your instructions

24

looked like.

25

And -

But then I looked on page 32(a)

And -- and if I were sitting there as a
15

judge, I would think, well, gee, that looks like a

2

single thing there.

3

have a (1) and a (2), and it just looks like it's one

4

ball of wax.

5

for just doing what I said?

6

They have it indented, and they

So can I really fault this Oregon court

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I -- I think so, because

7

the pattern instruction here told both parties to

8

include all their paragraphs pertaining to punitive

9

damages in one numbered instruction, 34.

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, they had some other

handbook that says beware of that.

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because you are going to

14

run into this rule that says if there is any part of a

15

single instruction that is wrong, goodbye, even if the

16

trial judge never mentioned it.

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

But that handbook came out in

18

2006.

And after all, that was a practice tip.

19

not a State court ruling saying you had to organize your

20

instruction this way.

21

It was

We had separate paragraphs, separately

22

numbered.

They dealt with different issues.

23

the Constitution and the other was the State statute.

24

And there's no Oregon case that said that in that

25

situation you have to break it out into a separate piece
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the notion was

that the charge should be limited to one issue, one

7

And it wasn't in just one

There were a few cited in the brief

MR. SHAPIRO:

damages in Instruction No. 34.

Both sides did that.

that to the pattern.

in paragraph 1, where he was wrong -- I don't have to go

Now we send it back, so he

Okay, now I've got to go to the rest of it.

16

MR. SHAPIRO:

You know, Justice Breyer, this

17

is very similar to what was at issue in the Flowers case

18

which reached this Court.

19

said if you intermix different appeal points in your

20

brief, we are not going to consider any of them if there

21

are any errors to be found in any of the paragraphs in

The Alabama Supreme Court had

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought the whole

24

thing about -- this is the NAACP case you that you were

25

discussing?
19

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- that this was

3

something that the Alabama Supreme Court really sprung

4

at the last minute, that it was not like this rule.

5

There were not 28 cases in the Alabama Supreme Court

6

applying the rule.

7

It seemed to be quite a novel rule.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, what -- what the State

8

argued there was that for 60 years the "correct in all

9

respects" rule was in effect in Alabama, and they cited

10

dozens of cases applying it.

11

held that that approach was pointless severity.

12

though the State supreme court there said, we can't

13

disentangle these arguments, it's too complicated, it's

14

too much of a burden on the State supreme court, this

15

Court unanimously found that was pointless severity.

16

And at that point -

There was a basis for

questioning the good faith of the court in that case, I

23

Well And I don't think that's

true here.
MR. SHAPIRO:

I -- I -- we don't question

24

the good faith of the court, but we say that this is

25

pointless severity, a rule that this Court has applied
20

more recently in Lee v. Kemna where there was no issue

2

of bad faith.

3

severe and unnecessarily severe to insist on a perfect

4

proposal in that case.

5

The Court thought that it was pointlessly

JUSTICE BREYER:

The best you have come up

6

with -- and I think you have researched this pretty

7

thoroughly -- and the best you have come up with to find

8

a case where they didn't apply the rule is that George

9

case, right?

10

"George," I think, is the name of it.

And there, there is an alternative ground

11

which is that the judge had to -- had to give the

12

instruction himself, and it's a criminal case.

13

Shepardized it and it has only been cited twice.

14

and so I'm slightly at sea, to tell you the truth.

15

-- and what is the standard I'm supposed to use to

16

decide whether that State ground is adequate as a matter

17

of Federal law or not?

18

MR. SHAPIRO:

And we
And And

Well, there is an earlier case

19

that is interesting, State v. Brown, which comes several

20

years before, and it's cited in our brief.

21

an imperfect instructional request was made, and the

22

Court still found that there was a duty to give the

23

instruction based on due process.

24

that the parties during the charge conference had

25

debated the issue.

In that case

And the reason was

It was a fair-enough exposition for
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the trial court to understand the need for the charge.

2

And here this really is much like the

3

Osborne case.

4

defendant didn't make any instructional proposal, and

5

this Court still reversed and required a new trial with

6

the correct instruction.

7

that.

8

sufficiently brought this to the attention of the trial

9

judge for Federal adequacy purposes even though no

10

You know, in the Osborne case the

It said due process required

And the Court said that we -- that the party had

instruction was -- was proposed.

11

The lawyer there merely moved to dismiss the

12

proceeding, never proposed an instruction, but this

13

Court required a retrial with a correct set of

14

instructions to the jury.

15

think; and also the Flowers case, I believe, is a

16

fortiori.

17

State interest there in having the lawyers break their

18

arguments up into separate headings and subheadings so

19

the appellate court could follow the argument.

20

That's an a fortiori case, I

There really was a strong and compelling

But here there wasn't any burden placed on

21

the trial judge at all by our request.

She was going

22

through these one by one, and she asked us:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so we -

She didn't get to the -

the other grounds, because I think it was all about that

paragraph and whether that paragraph was adequate under

6

our then precedent.

7

-- the incorrect portions of the charge that have now -

8

are now before us were -- were even reached then.

And I don't think that -- that the

that; that's unnecessary.

the "may versus shall" issue because she was working

no work for the trial judge at all because she was

24

the court.

25

They didn't even

She could have used it, and indeed there was

And you have to ask in this situation, what
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is the legitimate State interest that would support this

2

massive forfeiture of a very important due process

3

right?

4

that it promotes affirmance of jury verdicts whether or

5

not there has been a due process violation.

6

about that.

7

The plaintiff says the State interest here is

But think

That's hardly a State interest.
JUSTICE BREYER:

The State interest in the

8

rule in general, I take it, is to require the lawyers,

9

if they are going to object to the instructions that the

10

judge is going to give, to produce an instruction that

11

is a correct instruction of the law.

12

why, I guess, they have this rule.

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -- that's

Oh, yes.
And -- and you'd better get

15

it right, because if you don't get it right, you're

16

going to lose your ability to claim that the judge was

17

wrong in refusing to give any part of it.

18

Now, if that's the reason they have that

19

rule, that would seem to apply as much in this case as

20

in any other case.

21

Why wouldn't it?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, please recall that in

22

both Osborne and in the Lee case, there was a general

23

State purpose of that kind that supported the rule, but

24

the Court said it was an exorbitant or unnecessarily

25

severe application of the rule.

And that's what we

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contend here, that this is exorbitant, it serves no

2

legitimate purpose.

3

just nullifies the defendant's due process rights.

4

It is truly a game of gotcha that

And that precedent I think would be of great

5

concern in various fields of law.

6

that will apply in civil rights cases in the future,

7

criminal cases, all sorts of cases.

8
9

This is a rule of law

So I -- I think if this Court does apply its
own criteria here, it will see that this is an exercise

10

in futility, it was an ambush as a practical matter.

11

didn't have any reason to think we had to submit this

12

again on a separate piece of paper.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could you just tell me,

14

well, why was it an exercise in futility?

15

don't quite understand.

16

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's what I

Oh, because the judge had

17

ruled as a matter of substantive law that she wasn't

18

going to give this instruction.

19

we separated it.

it was already covered.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8
9
10

MR. PECK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court's constitutional mandate in this

11

case is conditioned in several significant respects, and

12

it invites the discretion and judgment of a State court

13

that's applying it.

14

have flexibility in coming up with a procedure to

15

address this procedural due process issue.

16

First of all, it says that States

It also says that it has to be an

17

appropriate case; there has to be a significant risk of

18

juror confusion, and a request.

19

in the opinion that this Court intended to federalize

20

the State procedure over how that request occurs.

21

There's no indication

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't dispute

22

that it's a Federal question whether that procedure is

23

adequate and independent?

24
25

MR. PECK:

I do not, but I also submit that

it is more than adequate.

Exist -- what the Oregon
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Supreme Court decided was that the existing procedure

2

permitting a limiting instruction to be requested -- in

3

Oregon it's Rule 105, same language as in the Federal

4

rule -- and such a request has to be timely, it has to

5

be specific, it has to be on the record.

6

precedent says that when we mean specific, the proponent

7

has to give us the exact language -- this is part of the

8

party presentation principle -- the exact language that

9

they are asking us to use.

10

And Oregon

And that means that we also apply our

11

traditional 92-year-old rule that requests for

12

instruction must be clear and correct in all respects.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

are not quite as clear as I suggested.

16

couldn't find in those 28 cases really a comparable

17

situation.

18

MR. PECK:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem I would say the 28 cases
That is, I

Well In each instance it seemed

20

as if one of two things was the case:

Either, A, where

21

the instruction was in error, it really was the matter

22

brought up in the first place, or the court said, but he

23

gave the essence of the instruction he wanted anyway.

24

Now, which of those cases do you think -- I

25

am leading up to, what of -- what of those cases do you
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think is your best support, because I couldn't -- they

2

are not perfect.

3

MR. PECK:

I would look first at

4

Reyes-Camarena, which is a 2000 -- a 2000 decision

5

involving the death penalty.

6

parts of this request, in a single request.

7

asked for a mitigating factors instruction, which the

8

court found was correct on the law and -- and would have

9

been given had it been asked for separately.

And there, there were two
The request

10

But it also asked the jury to consider

11

sympathy for the defendant, which they found to be

12

contrary to Oregon law, and therefore, it was not error

13

for the trial court to have refused this.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- what you can't tell

15

from that is what was the part of the sympathy

16

instruction that they thought was wrong, and was the

17

part that they thought was wrong really part and parcel

18

of the part that the -- that the appellant was

19

complaining about.

20

MR. PECK:

Well, the court, though, did cite

21

a prior decision that talked about a sympathy

22

instruction and claimed that this one was no different

23

than that.

24

It makes clear, the opinion does, on that.

25

It was contained in a single instruction.

6

And in Owings, it's very

There you have two different parts of an

And this -- this one deals with

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I remember that,

7

because they said on that one -- some floor covering

8

thing, wasn't it, that they had some liability for bad

9

floors or designing the floors wrong -

10

MR. PECK:

If -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

If that's the case, what

12

they said was:

Don't worry about it because basically

13

he did give you the instruction that you wanted, though

14

in a different way -

15

MR. PECK:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

But -- and besides that, they

added -

18

MR. PECK:

And besides that -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. PECK:

21

Then in Hotelling v. Walther, a 1944 case,

22

the proposed instruction consist -- consisted of three

23

separate sentences, and the Court does reprint that

24

instruction.

25

different legal proposition in it.

You're right.

-- this was an alternate ground.

And each of those sentences has a

30
Alderson Reporting Company

And it was only the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

last sentence, the third proposition, that the Court

2

found to be in error, and therefore, found that there

3

was no error in failing to give this instruction because

4

it was not clear and correct in all respects.

5

I -- I think that that -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

In the last one, what I

7

have here is that the court said the so-called requested

8

instruction was never requested at all -

9

MR. PECK:

But -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

But I do not believe that that

that this execution is unconstitutional, and then we

And so, put

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

do if this is the death case and not the case that you

2

have?

3

MR. PECK:

Well, you know, it's -- it's hard

4

to get my arms around your hypothetical, because I don't

5

know the grounds on which -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm just imagining that

7

what has happened is that the instruction that they have

8

given for the defendant in the death case violates

9

Federal law, and then we send it back, and what happens

10

is that the State court says, oh, it may violate Federal

11

law all right, but it's -- the Federal court is blocked

12

from considering it because there are these two other

13

State grounds that mean that the lawyer -

14

MR. PECK:

I understand.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. PECK:

Okay.

But -- but the question would be

17

then, why would that be a situation like this, where the

18

trial judge -- contrary to your assumption,

19

Justice Ginsburg -- the trial judge did find that there

20

were other parts of the instructions offered by Philip

21

Morris that were incorrect on the law, and the illicit

22

profits was one of them.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

just stop there?

State -

Why didn't the trial judge

I mean, if this is the ruling in the

MR. PECK:

Justice -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- once the trial judge

3

found that one of the other instructions was bad, he

4

could have just said, I throw the whole thing out.

5

did he go to all the trouble of going into this, the

6

governing one?

7

MR. PECK:

Why

This is -- this is a process.

8

Counsel in the case in a trial in Oregon can offer

9

instructions every -- a proffered instruction up to the

10

point when the jury is instructed under their law.

11

Philip Morris had the opportunity to correct it.

12

practical nature of a charge conference is that the

13

parties come in with their proposed instructions.

14

plaintiffs followed the pattern instruction, which by

15

the way does not require enumeration.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a rule of appellate review.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I -- yes,

22

that's exactly right.

And I think the purpose for the

23

rule is to avoid confusion about the ground of decision

24

for the trial court.

25

If you have got two errors, and

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you don't know which basis was at issue.

2

doubt here the basis on which the trial court was

3

ruling, is there?

4

MR. PECK:

There is no

I believe there is -- there -

5

first of all the trial judge rejected this instruction

6

on multiple grounds, and made it clear that the illicit

7

profits request was contrary to the Oregon statute that

8

sets up the criteria.

9

and contradictory.

10

She found other parts confusing

things that I think are significant here.

Philip Morris was advocating.

19

The trial judge, if you turn to 21a of the joint

MR. PECK:

She seemed to accept -- she

4

accepted the point before you announced the rule, and

5

the Oregon Court of Appeals ruling in the Estate of

instruction, reversed the verdict, in part because that

instruction they said should have been given.

anticipated this Court's rule.

So they

I think -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To move -- to move

11

from the trial court to the appellate court, if you are

12

correct that there is this routine, clear rule of State

13

procedure, why would the appellate court say, in its

head, well, I could rely on that, but I want to decide

15

this complicated, difficult rule of Federal

16

constitutional law instead?

17

MR. PECK:

Well, in fact, the -- the court

18

thought it was relying on it.

19

iterations in the Oregon Court of Appeals and in the

20

Oregon Supreme Court, they cited this rule, "clear and

21

correct in all respects," in order to reject the "harm

22

to others" instruction because they said it was

inconsistent with State law.

procedural rule that we reached because it was barred by

this adequate and independent State ground that the

3

Oregon courts had relied upon?

4

MR. PECK:

No.

What I'm saying is that they

went further then, and this is what gave this Court the

6

authority to rule on that substantive issue.

that that request was inconsistent with the Oregon

That

made.

2

They thought there was no Federal issue addressing that,

3

and so they decided that they didn't have to reach any

4

other State law issues.

5

preserved objections that Mrs. Williams made to the

6

other parts of this unified instruction on punitive

They thought they were wrong on a State ground.

And they ignored the well

still don't see that answer.

Well, I'm sorry.

I

You are saying they said

10

yes, there was this rule of Oregon law, but you can

11

still reach -- there might still be a Federal due

12

process issue, so we just can't rely on that.

13

that's true, then that seems to me to be a concession

14

that this is not an adequate and independent State

15

ground that would bar consideration of a Federal

16

constitutional issue.

17

MR. PECK:

And if

What was not an adequate on

18

independent State grounds was their decision that the

19

Oregon statute which permits you to punish a misconduct

20

in order to deter others from doing that allowed

21

punishment for harm to non-parties.

22

That part was their interpretation of the

23

statute, and if there were no due process equation here,

24

that would have been an independent State ground.

25

was wrong as a matter of due process.
40
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But there are other grounds, other mistakes,

2

substantive mistakes, avoiding law in this instruction.

3

And any trial court that gave instruction number 34,

4

which was objected to as a whole, would have committed

5

reversible error because they failed to follow the

6

Oregon statute.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess I think it's

8

the more routine practice for a court, if you have a -

9

again, as you argue -- a clear procedural rule that bars

10

addressing the substantive issue, to go ahead and rely

11

on that.

12

of uncertain application, maybe you go ahead and say,

13

well, we we're going to decide on the merits anyway.

Now, if the procedural rule is difficult and

18

going to do the hard work rather than the easy work.

MR. PECK:

It's a clear and easy

I think it was natural for the

20

court to do that.

21

by Philip Morris.

5
6

MR. PECK:

I think the easiest way to look

at this -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. PECK:

9

Yes.

-- is imagine that the statute of

limitations, which now bars any such suit in Oregon,

10

were brought today, after this Court's decision in

11

Williams, and imagine that Philip Morris is the

12

defendant, and at the end of the trial they offer their

13

number 34 as it was before saying, "This Court said that

14

they had made the right choice in asking for this

15

instruction."

16

A trial court clearly would engage in

17

reversible error if they gave that instruction because

18

it materially departs from Oregon law.

19

time, they could deny that instruction.

20

that instruction, and the Oregon Supreme Court would not

21

violate the mandate of this Court's decision by saying

22

that that is a correct decision on the part of the trial

law court because it was not clear and correct in all

respects.

This is still a rule that has to apply to its

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what they say is -

4

look at the two errors they found.

One is in saying

5

"may" instead of "shall," and the other is in saying

6

"illicit profit" instead of "profit."

7

pretty picky.

8

not only are they being picky, but they are being picky

9

after the event.

And they are

So, this is very picky, they say.

And

And they could have raised it first,

10

and they have 28 cases supporting them, but none of

11

these cases is right on point because the subject matter

12

is, you know, closer bound up.

13

together and say it's an unreasonable application of a

14

rule that was there.

15

MR. PECK:

And so they put all this

And you say I would urge you, Justice Breyer,

16

to look at the original case in 1916, the Sorenson case.

17

There the court was face with a question:

18

the kernel of a correct instruction in there, is that

19

adequate to ask the court to give that instruction or

20

should we insist on what they thought at the time was

21

the majority rule in the United States, that we should

22

insist on an instruction that is clear and correct in

23

all respects, and that the -- that the counsel has the

responsibility to provide that?

with the clear and correct rule.

that they had, and that debate informs this one.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sorenson was the agent and

the principal, the broker who was selling some land.

4

MR. PECK:

Right.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think in that case

6

they also said, "By the way, you've got basically the

7

instruction that you wanted, and you overlooked" -- no,

8

that was the case where they said, "You overlooked in

9

your instruction an important allegation of fact," which

10

allegation was that the guy had been rehired as a

11

broker.

12

MR. PECK:

And there's a similar distinction

that makes Osborne irrelevant, which counsel suggested

presentation principle puts the onus on counsel to do

want to.

orders are in error or not?

MR. PECK:

16

the Oregon Supreme Court took that remand order to mean

17

that they had to have in place -- this was a procedural

procedure that was fair, outcome neutral, applied -

When considering "We remand so that the

by purporting to require the State courts to follow a

certain order of battle in the decision of issues before

them so that when the case gets to us, we can be assured

that there is no lurking issue that has not yet been

believe that it would be error to suggest to the State

18

That is certainly not our case.

So there

We have a

separately numbered paragraph dealing with the

Constitution, which is quite apart from the statutory

factors.

22

Now, counsel referred to the charge actually

against punishment for harm to nonparties.
