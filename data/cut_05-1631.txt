ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP W. SAVRIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We'll hear argument

MR. SAVRIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

10

This case concerns whether a police officer

11

could be held personally liable for using force to

12

terminate a dangerous high-speed pursuit.

13

undisputed facts show that Deputy Scott did not violate

14

the Fourth Amendment.

15

officers on a nine-mile pursuit at exceptionally high

16

speeds.

18

roads at night.

20

the wrong lane of travel.

The

Respondent had led the police

As the videotapes that have been admitted in

He swerved across the double line to

He weaved through a shopping center and

Deputy Scott at that point had tried to

24

block the exit from the shopping center, but Mr. Harris

25

was successful in using his vehicle to escape.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

At that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

point, he continued driving at exceptionally high

2

speeds.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can I ask this question

4

about the shopping center.

Wouldn't your case be

5

exactly the same if the shopping center incident had not

6

occurred?

7

MR. SAVRIN:

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

It would, Your Honor.
So that we really don't

have to get distracted by the shopping center?

10

MR. SAVRIN:

There is a -- yes, Your Honor.

11

There is a factual dispute as far as whether Deputy

12

Scott's vehicle collided with Mr. Harris' vehicle or

13

vice versa, but we do not believe that that is a

14

material dispute.

15

undisputed fact, that Mr. Harris was driving at such

16

exceptionally high rate of speeds -- and to put in

17

context, 90 miles per hour, which is the average speed,

18

and of course -

19

We believe that the fact, the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure why you

20

concede that.

I mean, I looked at the case and it

21

seemed to me it's a case involving the whole ball of

22

wax.

23

affected by the fact that he went through the shopping

24

center, came out and crashed into a police car, which is

25

what Scott saw.

And I suspect my reaction to that tape was in part

4

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. SAVRIN:

2

think that is part of the analysis.

3

But Scott -- yes, Your Honor, I

JUSTICE BREYER:

So how do I know whether,

4

which of these things is directly or not indirectly -

5

well, you go ahead.

6

supposed to look at the part which involves the shopping

7

center?

8
9

But I mean, are you -- am I not

MR. SAVRIN:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

My

point was that, the point was that there was a

10

collision, not who caused the collision, whether the

11

deputy pulled into Mr. Harris' line of travel or

12

Mr. Harris pulled towards the deputy.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is the rule that you

14

propose that the policeman must balance the risk of harm

15

to others versus the risk of harm to the fleeing person?

16

MR. SAVRIN:

Your Honor -- yes, essentially.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your brief says that the

18

officer reasonably believes that doing so, i.e.,

19

terminating the chase, would avoid a greater risk of

20

bodily injury or death.

21

MR. SAVRIN:

22
23
24
25

Yes, Your Honor.

And we

believe JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Greater than what?

Greater than MR. SAVRIN:

Greater than not taking action.

In other words, that the harm -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Without reference to the

3

possible harm to the driver?

I just want to know what

4

you're testing.

5
6

MR. SAVRIN:

I think that -- I think that is

one of the factors to be considered.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know that I agree

8

with that.

I mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an

9

hour is responsible for endangering people, you're

10

proposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent

11

chance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50

12

percent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop

13

him, you shouldn't do anything.

14

that.

15

MR. SAVRIN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't agree with

Well, Your Honor I'd stop him.

I mean, he's

17

the fellow that's causing the danger, endangerment,

18

isn't he?

MR. SAVRIN:
with that.

21
22
23

Yes, Your Honor, I would agree

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think you're giving away

too much.
MR. SAVRIN:

One thing I did want to point

24

out is that a speed of 90 miles per hour -- and of

25

course there's evidence in the record that the vehicles

were at times traveling over 100 miles an hour -

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I didn't mean to put words

3

in your mouth.

4

whether there is a greater risk in stopping him or not

5

stopping him as to other people, without reference to

6

the risk to himself.

7
8

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, that's probably a better

articulation.

9
10

It seems to me your test might be

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it's your brief.

I

want you to -

11

MR. SAVRIN:

I think that's a better

12

articulation of what the appropriate test would be, the

13

way -

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, isn't the speed also

15

relevant to the likelihood that -- that running into a

16

car at that speed would cause the death of a driver?

17

MR. SAVRIN:

It would, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't it a fair high

19

probability that if you hit someone at that speed that

20

there will be something, either death or serious injury

21

as a result?

22

MR. SAVRIN:

Your Honor, my answer to that

23

question would be that that's always going to be the

24

case whenever force is used to stop a vehicle at this

25

high rate of speed.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I suppose there is

2

also a high probability where you're going 90 miles an

3

hour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow

4

line, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt

5

somebody else.

6

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, the more you

8

increase the speed the more likely he's going to be

9

hurt.

But also the more likely if you let him go

10

somebody else is going to be hurt.

11

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And to put it

12

in a more complete perspective, 90 miles an hour is

13

mathematically equivalent to over 130 feet per second.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Mr. Savrin, there was

15

an episode in the parking lot where things came to a

16

temporary halt.

17

that point, maybe Harris would not -- maybe he would

18

have slowed down.

19

from the police, but if the police weren't after him

20

there is no indication that he would have been speeding.

If Scott had stopped pursuing Harris at

If he was -- he was trying to flee

21

MR. SAVRIN:

Well, Your Honor, I would

22

disagree with that, that in fact -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, he was

24

speeding before the police knew about him, right?

25

That's the whole, where this all started.
8

MR. SAVRIN:

The initial offense was

2

speeding, and Mr. Harris, instead of pulling over or

3

slowing down as would might be expected by a reasonable

4

person, sped up and continued to drive recklessly.

5

We would contend that it was Mr. Harris that

6

was in control of the force that the officers need to

terminate, the risk that he presented.

9

vehicle or stopped, and he chose not to do that.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

That's the test,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SAVRIN:

Your Honor, as I read the

2

Garner opinion, the court did not need to reach a

3

definition of deadly force because shooting someone in

4

the back of the head is clearly going to be deadly

5

force.

6

circuit courts in the wake of Garner have said that

7

Garner did not create a test and have created different

8

tests along the lines of the Model Penal Code to reach

9

that definition.

The circuit courts -- I can tell you that the

But the point -- I was going to say a

10

point that I would like to make is that there are

11

degrees even within the continuum that might be within a

12

definition of deadly force, such as using a vehicle to

13

make contact, blowing out the tires, using stop sticks,

14

using a firearm.

16

deadly force there are decisions that an officer has to

17

make.

Those have different degrees of

killing 11 people.

deadly force because the officers were trying to gain

4

access to the building and they reasonably believe that

they were able to do that without the loss of life.

think that if that definition were applied to this case,

Your Honor, because Mr. Harris

could have regained control of his vehicle.

The point

10

is that Mister -- that the Petitioner had limited

options based on the manner in which Mr. Harris was

12

driving.

13

we do believe it would be justified under the

14

circumstances.

me that's clearly a question for the jury.

jury question.

But I do concede that if it's not deadly

Alderson Reporting Company

force it's very close to it.

But I think the important

2

thing is that, whatever force Mister -- the Petitioner

3

used was limited by Mr. Harris' driving.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Savrin, one technique

5

that Officer Scott asked permission to use was described

6

as a PIT technique that would be a life and limb-

7

sparing measure.

8

called and asked permission to use that less risky

9

method and yet when he determined that he couldn't do

One oddity about this case is that he

10

that, given the speed of the vehicles, he didn't ask

11

permission to do what he did do, which was

12

life-endangering.

13

MR. SAVRIN:

Your Honor, if I could respond

14

to that in two respects.

First, it is not, it is not

15

the case that the PIT maneuver, as it's commonly called,

16

is safe.

17

Mr. Harris' vehicle had been spun out in this case it is

18

more likelihood that he would have lost control.

19

other words, it causes the vehicle to lose control.

What it does is spin the car out, and if

In

20

The second response I would have is that the

21

Petitioner did ask permission to do the PIT maneuver and

22

the permission that the supervisor gave, which was Mr.

23

Faninger that's in the record undisputed, was to use

24

force up to deadly force.

And he said he gave

permission for more than PIT procedure?

5

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

His testimony

6

was that he was giving, he believes he was giving

7

permission up to and including deadly force.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the phrase used was

"take him out," wasn't it?

10

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, Your Honor.
Does a police officer have

12

any obligation in a situation like this to consider

13

other alternatives, and if so what other alternatives

14

might have been available to this officer?

15

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

I think

16

the officer had very limited options, two options at

17

that point:

18

I think it was a balancing of -

19

Either use force or let Mr. Harris go.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

And even with letting him

20

go, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up

21

ahead or get other people involved in the attempt to

22

catch him?

23

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, there always are other

24

potentials.

However, I would submit that a vehicle

25

traveling at 130 feet per second can do a lot of damage

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't it true that there's

MR. SAVRIN:

Deputy Scott took the action

that he did because there was a low likelihood of injury

to third parties other than to Mr. Harris because there

was no one in his immediate path of travel.

Because there were -- the

13

cars during this period of time.

contact was made, a vehicle was passed by Mr. Harris.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No but if you're thinking

of the likelihood of harm if they discontinued the

There isn't a question.

There is a question of whether it justifies the use of

deadly force, to prevent this -- this situation.

15

MR. GARRE:

The question in our mind,

16

Justice Stevens, is whether Deputy Scott reasonably

17

believed that Respondent posed a serious risk of injury

18

or death to other motor vehicles, bystanders or police

19

on the roadway that night.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why are these absolute?

Two, did Scott know that the reason he was chasing this

person was because he had violated a speed limit, or was

14

he ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing

15

away at 90 miles an hour, which is as far as the record

16

could show?

17

MR. GARRE:

Justice Breyer, to answer the

second question first, Scott did not know that he was

19

initially in a chase.

21
22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And a reasonable juror

could not conclude to the contrary?
MR. GARRE:

Well, Scott, I believe, Scott's

testimony was that he did not know.

MR. GARRE:

The key,

the key point about this case is the threat that

that is fundamentally different from Garner for the

reason that you mentioned.

Yes.

It doesn't matter why the

determined that Respondent posed a grave threat to other

The point is that when Scott made the

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

5

I'd like to begin by responding to some of

6

the questions that were asked of Petitioner.

7

all, Officer Scott himself admitted in his testimony

8

that he knew at the time that he was using deadly force,

9

and he realized at the time that he was likely to cause

injury or -- death or serious injury to Mr. Harris.

Is there any doubt

12

that Mr. Harris was likely to cause death or serious

injury to the other cars on the highway that he was

passing?

MR. JONES:

Mr. Harris was simply a -- an

unsafe driver.

question is whether he was creating a substantial risk

22

of death or serious bodily harm to others.

MR. JONES:

Well, the holding of the Adams

3

versus St. Lucie County case was that in 1985, an

4

incident which occurred six weeks after the Garner

5

decision and four years before the Brower decision,

6

there is no way the officers could have known at that

7

time that their act of ramming a police car to prevent

an escape of another fleeing vehicle would have been

9

considered deadly force in violation of the Fourth

10

Amendment.

12

in 1993, this was now clearly established.

That was one option.

He could

the accident, but in most states -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, aren't they the

7

proximate cause if they continue the chase without

8

trying to terminate it?

9

MR. JONES:

That's correct.

If the officer

10

terminates the chase then he is never going to be liable

11

because number one he is acting prudently; he is going

other problems.

20

But isn't there -- but

21

isn't that one way to assure that the police are not

22

liable, both from a moral standpoint and a legal

23

standpoint, for causing the injury of other people?

24
25

MR. JONES:

Now from a constitutional

standpoint the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect other

people.

2

that's, that's the framework we are dealing with here

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Well, you mean it's

5

irrelevant to our analysis to consider that he might

injure other people?

MR. JONES:

The potential for danger to

question.

In trying to assess the likelihood of harm to

2

innocent people who would be hurt by this by this guy

3

driving so fast, is that, do we measure it by assuming

4

that the chase will continue?

5

assuming that the chase would be discontinued?

6

MR. JONES:

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

MR. JONES:

Or do we measure it by

The officer Just as we did in Garner?

The officer has both options.

I

9

mean Garner simply commands that he not use deadly force

10

if it's a choice between letting him go and using deadly

11

force.

12

that involves a different, a different type of claim and

13

a different standard.

14

does say that an officer in a pursuit has a duty to

15

always be weighing the risk of the continued pursuit

16

against the risk to the public.

17

independent duty there to act reasonably.

18

Now in the Sacramento v Lewis case, it does say

But in the Sacramento case it

If it were -- clear that a

jury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk

to innocent motorists if they discontinued the chase -

22

would there be a duty to discontinue the chase?

Not under the Fourth Amendment.

10

MR. JONES:

Garner was the case involving shooting the guy in the

19

back, right?

20

MR. JONES:

Yes.

He might easily break into

21

someone else's house and perhaps end up killing them.

This was a vigorous dissent in Garner.

use of deadly force is a sufficiently productive means

And if unsafe driving -

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But your, your answer to

5

6

have the duty to discontinue the chase?

7

that is that the police may prolong the chase, i.e.,

8

prolong the injury to the public.

answer.

10

MR. JONES:

The obverse of

I'm surprised at your

independent duty, it doesn't rise under the Fourth

12

between -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It is certainly the case

16

that if there is going to be a, a risk of deadly harm to

innocent third parties, there would be a duty to

discontinue the chase rather kill him.

seem to buy that.

But you don't

Well, experience shows most of

the time when you discontinue a chase, the person who is

running discontinues driving unsafely.

23

that is experience.

That is the -

Well, the rule simply says you

don't kill him just because he is driving unsafely.

him and letting him go, you have to let him go if the

of Appeals:

Who do you believe, me or your own eyes?
MR. SAVRIN:

Your Honor, I think the answer

21

to that question was provided in this decision in

22

Ornelas versus United States, a decision by this Court

23

in 1996 that came up in the context of a criminal, a

24

direct criminal appeal involving the question of

25

probable cause.

And this Court set forth very clearly
54
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that the historical facts are given deference.

2

question of, a legal question about whether those facts

3

reasonably give rise to probable cause is an independent

4

de novo review.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whether he is endangering

6

anybody is a historical fact, no?

7

about that finding?

9

MR. SAVRIN:

The

So what do you do

I don't believe that is

historical fact.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. SAVRIN:

It is.

The historical facts here are

12

whether Mr. Harris was driving excessively, whether he

13

was driving across the line, whether he was driving at

14

high rates of speed, whether there was anybody in his

15

path, whether he had collided with anyone.

16

question about whether or not those facts give rise to

17

probable cause to believe that Harris was a threat of

18

serious physical harm is a legal issue, and I think the

19

Court of Appeals recognized that in this case when they

20

applied a different analysis or came out with a

21

different result to those same undisputed facts.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think the

What is the, the court

23

saying -- and this is on page 39 A of the petition

24

appendix -- when Harris was driving away from officers

25

and when there, when there were no other motorists or
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's

2

assertion that at the time of the ramming, Harris posed

3

an immediate threat of harm to others.

4

This is a finding that there were no other

5

motorists or pedestrians nearby when the ramming

6

occurred.

7

MR. SAVRIN:

And that is a fact that we

8

accept as true in the immediate vicinity.

The tape

9

shows that there was a vehicle just 12 seconds before,

10

and I think that a reasonable officer at the time would

11

believe that that wasn't going to be the last vehicle on

12

that road.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would hope he would wait

14

until there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming

15

before he, before he did the ramming.

16

MR. SAVRIN:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

Yes, Your Honor.
I assume he waited

precisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?

19

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Exactly.

20

had limited options and I believe it was a no-win

21

scenario.

22

reasonably believed he could at the time.

23

And he took the best course that he

And -

Do you agree with

24

Mr. Jones' statement that none of Mr. Harris' conduct

25

rose to the level of a felony?

He

MR. SAVRIN:

I would not, Your Honor.

In

2

our brief we did list a number of felonies that

3

Mr. Harris, that we believe he committed.

4

go back to Garner, and Garner says that an armed suspect

5

would have been a different case.

6

that some misdemeanors such as drunk driving are more

7

dangerous that some felonies such as white collar crime.

8

So I think the question should not be whether it's a

9

technical issue of crossing the line from misdemeanor to

But I would

And Garner also says

10

felony, but the harm that is being caused by the

11

continued driving that's exactly what occurred in this

12

case.

13

And if I could respond to Justice Breyer's

14

question about what to do in terms of responding to

15

Mr. Marx's question, I think the Ornelas case says that

16

you would review it for clear error.

17

you would not owe deference of a finding of fact by the

18

lower court.
