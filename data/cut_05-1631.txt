ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

We'll hear argument

MR. SAVRIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

10

This case concerns whether a police officer

11

could be held personally liable for using force to

12

terminate a dangerous high-speed pursuit.

13

undisputed facts show that Deputy Scott did not violate

14

the Fourth Amendment.

16

speeds.

point, he continued driving at exceptionally high

speeds.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can I ask this question

4

about the shopping center.

Wouldn't your case be

5

exactly the same if the shopping center incident had not

6

occurred?

7

MR. SAVRIN:

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

It would, Your Honor.
So that we really don't

have to get distracted by the shopping center?

10

MR. SAVRIN:

There is a -- yes, Your Honor.

11

There is a factual dispute as far as whether Deputy

12

Scott's vehicle collided with Mr. Harris' vehicle or

13

vice versa, but we do not believe that that is a

14

material dispute.

15

undisputed fact, that Mr. Harris was driving at such

16

exceptionally high rate of speeds -- and to put in

17

context, 90 miles per hour, which is the average speed,

18

and of course -

19

We believe that the fact, the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure why you

20

concede that.

I mean, I looked at the case and it

21

seemed to me it's a case involving the whole ball of

22

wax.

23

affected by the fact that he went through the shopping

24

center, came out and crashed into a police car, which is

25

what Scott saw.

And I suspect my reaction to that tape was in part

MR. SAVRIN:

2

think that is part of the analysis.

3

But Scott -- yes, Your Honor, I

So how do I know whether,

4

which of these things is directly or not indirectly -

5

well, you go ahead.

6

supposed to look at the part which involves the shopping

7

center?

8
9

But I mean, are you -- am I not

MR. SAVRIN:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

My

point was that, the point was that there was a

10

collision, not who caused the collision, whether the

11

deputy pulled into Mr. Harris' line of travel or

12

Mr. Harris pulled towards the deputy.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is the rule that you

14

propose that the policeman must balance the risk of harm

15

to others versus the risk of harm to the fleeing person?

16

MR. SAVRIN:

Your Honor -- yes, essentially.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your brief says that the

18

officer reasonably believes that doing so, i.e.,

19

terminating the chase, would avoid a greater risk of

20

bodily injury or death.

21

MR. SAVRIN:

22
23
24
25

Yes, Your Honor.

And we

believe JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Greater than what?

Greater than MR. SAVRIN:

Greater than not taking action.

possible harm to the driver?

I just want to know what

4

you're testing.

6

MR. SAVRIN:

I think that -- I think that is

one of the factors to be considered.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know that I agree

8

with that.

I mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an

9

hour is responsible for endangering people, you're

10

proposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent

11

chance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50

12

percent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop

13

him, you shouldn't do anything.

14

that.

15

MR. SAVRIN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't agree with

Well, Your Honor I'd stop him.

I mean, he's

17

the fellow that's causing the danger, endangerment,

with that.

Yes, Your Honor, I would agree

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think you're giving away

too much.
MR. SAVRIN:

One thing I did want to point

24

out is that a speed of 90 miles per hour -- and of

25

course there's evidence in the record that the vehicles

in your mouth.

whether there is a greater risk in stopping him or not

5

stopping him as to other people, without reference to

6

the risk to himself.

7
8

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, that's probably a better

articulation.

It seems to me your test might be

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it's your brief.

I

want you to -

11

MR. SAVRIN:

I think that's a better

12

articulation of what the appropriate test would be, the

13

way -

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, isn't the speed also

15

relevant to the likelihood that -- that running into a

16

car at that speed would cause the death of a driver?

17

MR. SAVRIN:

It would, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't it a fair high

19

probability that if you hit someone at that speed that

20

there will be something, either death or serious injury

21

as a result?

22

MR. SAVRIN:

Your Honor, my answer to that

23

question would be that that's always going to be the

24

case whenever force is used to stop a vehicle at this

25

high rate of speed.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I suppose there is

2

also a high probability where you're going 90 miles an

3

hour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow

4

line, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt

5

somebody else.

6

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, the more you

8

increase the speed the more likely he's going to be

9

hurt.

But also the more likely if you let him go

10

somebody else is going to be hurt.

11

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And to put it

12

in a more complete perspective, 90 miles an hour is

13

mathematically equivalent to over 130 feet per second.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Mr. Savrin, there was

15

an episode in the parking lot where things came to a

16

temporary halt.

17

that point, maybe Harris would not -- maybe he would

18

have slowed down.

19

from the police, but if the police weren't after him

20

there is no indication that he would have been speeding.

If Scott had stopped pursuing Harris at

If he was -- he was trying to flee

MR. SAVRIN:

Well, Your Honor, I would

22

disagree with that, that in fact -

24

speeding before the police knew about him, right?

25

That's the whole, where this all started.

MR. SAVRIN:

The initial offense was

2

speeding, and Mr. Harris, instead of pulling over or

3

slowing down as would might be expected by a reasonable

4

person, sped up and continued to drive recklessly.

We would contend that it was Mr. Harris that

6

was in control of the force that the officers need to

terminate, the risk that he presented.

vehicle or stopped, and he chose not to do that.

That's the test,

MR. SAVRIN:

Your Honor, as I read the

2

Garner opinion, the court did not need to reach a

3

definition of deadly force because shooting someone in

4

the back of the head is clearly going to be deadly

5

force.

6

circuit courts in the wake of Garner have said that

7

Garner did not create a test and have created different

8

tests along the lines of the Model Penal Code to reach

9

that definition.

The circuit courts -- I can tell you that the

But the point -- I was going to say a

10

point that I would like to make is that there are

degrees even within the continuum that might be within a

12

definition of deadly force, such as using a vehicle to

13

make contact, blowing out the tires, using stop sticks,

using a firearm.

deadly force there are decisions that an officer has to

17

make.

deadly force because the officers were trying to gain

could have regained control of his vehicle.

10

is that Mister -- that the Petitioner had limited

options based on the manner in which Mr. Harris was

12

driving.

13

we do believe it would be justified under the

circumstances.

force it's very close to it.

But I think the important

2

thing is that, whatever force Mister -- the Petitioner

used was limited by Mr. Harris' driving.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Savrin, one technique

5

that Officer Scott asked permission to use was described

6

as a PIT technique that would be a life and limb-

7

sparing measure.

8

called and asked permission to use that less risky

9

method and yet when he determined that he couldn't do

One oddity about this case is that he

10

that, given the speed of the vehicles, he didn't ask

11

permission to do what he did do, which was

12

life-endangering.

13

MR. SAVRIN:

Your Honor, if I could respond

14

to that in two respects.

First, it is not, it is not

15

the case that the PIT maneuver, as it's commonly called,

16

is safe.

17

Mr. Harris' vehicle had been spun out in this case it is

18

more likelihood that he would have lost control.

19

other words, it causes the vehicle to lose control.

What it does is spin the car out, and if

In

The second response I would have is that the

21

Petitioner did ask permission to do the PIT maneuver and

22

the permission that the supervisor gave, which was Mr.

24

force up to deadly force.

permission for more than PIT procedure?

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

His testimony

6

was that he was giving, he believes he was giving

7

permission up to and including deadly force.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the phrase used was

"take him out," wasn't it?

10

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, Your Honor.
Does a police officer have

12

any obligation in a situation like this to consider

13

other alternatives, and if so what other alternatives

14

might have been available to this officer?

15

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

I think

16

the officer had very limited options, two options at

17

that point:

18

I think it was a balancing of -

19

Either use force or let Mr. Harris go.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

And even with letting him

20

go, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up

21

ahead or get other people involved in the attempt to

22

catch him?

23

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, there always are other

24

potentials.

However, I would submit that a vehicle

25

traveling at 130 feet per second can do a lot of damage

cars during this period of time.

he ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

5

I'd like to begin by responding to some of

6

the questions that were asked of Petitioner.

all, Officer Scott himself admitted in his testimony

that he knew at the time that he was using deadly force,

9

and he realized at the time that he was likely to cause

that Mr. Harris was likely to cause death or serious

injury to the other cars on the highway that he was

Mr. Harris was simply a -- an

MR. JONES:

Well, the holding of the Adams

3

versus St. Lucie County case was that in 1985, an

4

incident which occurred six weeks after the Garner

5

decision and four years before the Brower decision,

6

there is no way the officers could have known at that

time that their act of ramming a police car to prevent

an escape of another fleeing vehicle would have been

9

considered deadly force in violation of the Fourth

10

Amendment.

12

in 1993, this was now clearly established.

which Justice Scalia latched onto in that case, and said

that the mere fact that the person was fleeing by car in

was quite simply whether there had been a seizure.

second holding was that the Plaintiff had sufficiently

6

have continued the pursuit and simply decided not to mow

him off the road at 90 miles an hour, or he could have

question.

In trying to assess the likelihood of harm to

innocent people who would be hurt by this by this guy

driving so fast, is that, do we measure it by assuming

4

that the chase will continue?

5

6

MR. JONES:

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

MR. JONES:

Or do we measure it by

The officer Just as we did in Garner?

The officer has both options.

I

9

mean Garner simply commands that he not use deadly force

10

if it's a choice between letting him go and using deadly

11

force.

12

that involves a different, a different type of claim and

13

a different standard.

14

does say that an officer in a pursuit has a duty to

15

always be weighing the risk of the continued pursuit

16

against the risk to the public.

independent duty there to act reasonably.

Now in the Sacramento v Lewis case, it does say

jury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk

would there be a duty to discontinue the chase?

have the duty to discontinue the chase?

prolong the injury to the public.

pedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's

2

assertion that at the time of the ramming, Harris posed

3

an immediate threat of harm to others.

4

This is a finding that there were no other

5

motorists or pedestrians nearby when the ramming

6

occurred.

7

MR. SAVRIN:

And that is a fact that we

8

accept as true in the immediate vicinity.

The tape

9

shows that there was a vehicle just 12 seconds before,

10

and I think that a reasonable officer at the time would

11

believe that that wasn't going to be the last vehicle on

12

that road.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would hope he would wait

14

until there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming

15

before he, before he did the ramming.

16

MR. SAVRIN:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

Yes, Your Honor.
I assume he waited

precisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?

19

MR. SAVRIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Exactly.

20

had limited options and I believe it was a no-win

21

scenario.

22

reasonably believed he could at the time.

23

And he took the best course that he

Do you agree with

Mr. Jones' statement that none of Mr. Harris' conduct

MR. SAVRIN:

I would not, Your Honor.

In

2

our brief we did list a number of felonies that

3

Mr. Harris, that we believe he committed.

4

go back to Garner, and Garner says that an armed suspect

5

would have been a different case.

6

that some misdemeanors such as drunk driving are more

7

dangerous that some felonies such as white collar crime.

8

So I think the question should not be whether it's a

9

technical issue of crossing the line from misdemeanor to

But I would

And Garner also says

10

felony, but the harm that is being caused by the

11

continued driving that's exactly what occurred in this

12

case.

13

And if I could respond to Justice Breyer's

14

question about what to do in terms of responding to

15

Mr. Marx's question, I think the Ornelas case says that

16

you would review it for clear error.

17

you would not owe deference of a finding of fact by the

lower court.

Thank you,
