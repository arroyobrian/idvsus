            Mr. Pincus.

          ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. ANDREW J. PINCUS

7

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

            MR. PINCUS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9

and may it please the Court:

10

            This Court has said that the irreducible

11

constitutional minimum for standing is injury in fact;

12

that the plaintiff suffered actual or imminent, tangible

13

harm.

14

            In Lujan, the Court said that Congress may

15

elevate to the status of legallycognizable injuries,

16

concrete, de facto injuries that were previously

17

inadequate in law.

18

            Here, the Ninth Circuit held that there's no

19

need for any de facto injury.  A statutory violation

20

that in some general sense relates to the plaintiff is

21

all that's necessary, even though it has no tangible 

22

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Why is it you think 

23

            MR. PINCUS:   consequences 

24

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Let's say I agree with you

25

that there needs to be a concrete injury; that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

needs to have recognized something that looks like a

2

concrete injury.  But why isn't that exactly what

3

Congress did here?  So let me just frame it in a

4

hypothetical.

5

            Suppose that there's just a statute  it's

6

a little bit of a simpler statute, and you can argue

7

with me or tell me why it might or might not be

8

different, but I just want to understand your position.

9

            Suppose that there is a statute that just

10

says that one of these credit reporting agencies shall

11

not disseminate inaccurate information about people, or

12

shall  shall not do it willfully or negligently or

13

what have you, but shall not disseminate inaccurate

14

information about people.  And then there's a cause of

15

action that says if they disseminate inaccurate

16

information in a credit report about you, you can sue.

17

All right?

18

            Is that enough of a concrete injury for you?

19

            MR. PINCUS:  No, it's not, for  for three

20

reasons, Your Honor.

21

            And let me preface my response by saying

22

that, of course, that isn't the case with respect to

23

three of the claims in this case, which don't have

24

anything to do with inaccuracy.

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.  But let me focus on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

what seems to be 

2

            MR. PINCUS:  I'm happy to focus 

3

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   the gravamen of the

4

claim.

5

            And why isn't the dissemination of false

6

information about you in a credit report, why isn't

7

that  why isn't it  it perfectly sufficient if

8

Congress says that's a concrete injury?

9

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, I  I guess as a

10

threshold matter, I think what the Court has said in

11

other contexts is that Congress should clearly say that

12

it is going beyond the tangible injuries that this Court

13

has defined.  The Court has had a clear statement rule.

14

            And so another difference between your

15

hypothetical  I'm not sure whether your hypothetical

16

casts Congress clearly saying, and by the way, we are

17

creating a cause of action for people who otherwise

18

couldn't get into court.

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I'm sorry.

20

            MR. PINCUS:  Let me start  well, maybe I

21

can answer your question this way.

22

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  You said that there were

23

reasons why that was not a concrete injury 

24

            MR. PINCUS:  Yes.

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   the dissemination of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

false information about a particular person.

2

            Why?  Because to me, I'll just say, seems

3

like a concrete injury to me.

4

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, first  first of all 

5

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  You know?  If  I mean, if

6

somebody did it to me I'd feel harmed.

7

            And I think that if you went out on the

8

street and you did a survey, most people would feel

9

harmed.  Most people would feel as though they had some

10

interest that had been invaded.  And Congress recognized

11

that, thought it was a significant problem, passed a

12

statute to deal with that problem.

13

            MR. PINCUS:  First of all, the  the common

14

law tradition, which the Court has looked to, did not

15

say that the dissemination of any false statement was an

16

injury.

17

            To prove defamation 

18

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's quite right.  It's

19

not  it's not completely in the common law tradition.

20

But we've said many times that Congress gets to look

21

beyond the common law tradition and gets to identify

22

real world problems out there in the world, harming

23

people in realworld ways.  And that, it seems, is what

24

Congress did here.

25

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, let me answer your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

question in two ways.  I  I want to explain why  why

2

it isn't, and then I also want to explain why it's not

3

what Congress did here.

4

            So why it isn't:  There are places that the

5

Court has looked for guides.  One is the common law,

6

other  other kinds of torts, for example.

7

            In  in the restatement 

8

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can  can you explain,

9

then, the common law versus the legislature?  So if we

10

have some historic practice where damages are awarded to

11

someone who has no outofpocket loss, if the common law

12

says so it's okay but if Congress says so it's not?

13

That's very strange.

14

            MR. PINCUS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.

15

I think  well, this question takes me a little afield

16

from  from Justice Kagan's question.  But I think the

17

common law had some very specific areas where it defined

18

actual harm; for example, any intrusion on a property

19

right is actual harm, but there has to be a property

20

right for that to be so.

21

            So I think Congress could create a property

22

right.  And if it did that 

23

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm sorry.  You're

24

saying  contrary to one citation, you're actually 

25

Ashby v. White  that it isn't a right that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

has given you?

2

            I 

3

            MR. PINCUS:  Your Honor, I think 

4

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I mean, most of the

5

common law rights, like property rights, are  are

6

given to you by statute.  They're not given to you by

7

the common law.  Most people are coming in to sue on the

8

basis of a statute.

9

            MR. PINCUS:  And  and the question is 

10

there are several ways that they can establish standing.

11

One is to have the tangible harm, to meet the general

12

tangible harm test that this Court applies, generally,

13

in the standing context.  And that can be economic

14

injury, it can be other kinds of injury.  And the Court

15

has applied that in a  in a wide variety of contexts.

16

            The Court has also  it is also clear that

17

in the property rights context, when Congress just

18

doesn't create  or the common law doesn't just create

19

a right to sue but confers a property right, the right

20

to exclude, generally, as the Court has put it, that any

21

intrusion on that property right, on that right to

22

exclude, is tangible harm.

23

            And the Court has made clear in the 

24

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So if I have a dozen or

25

more cases that didn't involve property rights, where we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

didn't require economic harm, those would mean nothing

2

to you?

3

            MR. PINCUS:  Your Honor, I 

4

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Those legal rights, we

5

just decided through the centuries, all those cases

6

wrong?

7

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, I don't think  there

8

certainly aren't any cases that my friends cite that 

9

that meet that test.  It's not just economic harm.  It

10

can be psychic harm.  There are other  it can be

11

discrimination.

12

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, what's the answer,

13

then, to Justice Kagan's question?

14

            MR. PINCUS:  Okay.  I 

15

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You said it could be

16

psychic harm, there could be economic harm, there could

17

be all different kinds of harm.  And that being so, why

18

isn't what she said right, that one kind of harm could

19

be the harm suffered when somebody tells a lie about

20

you, or gives false information?

21

            What's different?

22

            MR. PINCUS:  It could be.

23

            If I can just finish my answer to  to

24

Justice Sotomayor, because I just want to make clear,

25

and I think the College Savings case is a perfect

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

analogy here, that every cause of action does not confer

2

a property right.  The Court there made that clear, and

3

that's why the property right rationale doesn't apply

4

here.

5

            Now, turning back to Justice Kagan's

6

question, I think there are other areas, other than

7

defamation where there's some guidance about what

8

constitutes tangible harm.

9

            For example, in the False Light cases, the

10

restatement has a comment that I think  this is a

11

Restatement (Second) of Torts 652E, comment (c) that's

12

very on point.

13

            It says, "Complete and perfect accuracy of

14

published reports concerning any individual is seldom

15

attainable by any reasonable effort.  And minor errors,

16

such as a wrong address or a mistake in the date of

17

employment, or similar unimportant details, would

18

not" 

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  These are not  these 

20

these are not unimportant details.  This is a  they

21

basically got everything wrong about him.  You know,

22

they got his marital status wrong, they got his income

23

wrong, they got his education wrong.  They basically

24

portrayed a different person than 

25

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, Your Honor, your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

hypothetical, though, is any false statement.  And I'm

2

trying to respond why a ruling by  a rule by Congress

3

of any false statement wouldn't qualify.

4

            So there is some legal precedents that tells

5

us 

6

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Here's the thing,

7

Mr. Pincus.  It seems to me that the  the one thing

8

that we have to say Congress is better at than we are is

9

identifying concrete harms.  I mean, it's perfectly

10

fine, and I agree with very large portions of your brief

11

when you say they have to have identified a concrete

12

harm.  It's like, fine, yes, they do.

13

            But now the question is, did they identify

14

one?  And it seems pretty clear what they wanted to do

15

here; that this statute is entirely about preventing the

16

dissemination of inaccurate information in credit

17

reports which they seem to think is both something that

18

harms the individual personally and also harms larger

19

systemic issues.  And then they gave the cause of action

20

to the people it harmed personally.

21

            And I guess  I mean, don't we owe them a

22

little bit of respect that they've actually identified a

23

realworld harm that it  that's out there?

24

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think there's a

25

threshold assumption in your question that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

actually identified that as a realworld harm.  And I

2

think there are two problems with that.

3

            First of all, the structure of the statute

4

indicates that that's not so.  The willfulness cause of

5

action that provides for statutory damages applies to

6

every violation of the statute that's willful, including

7

those that don't involve false statements.

8

            So by enacting  if the argument is by

9

enacting the willfulness cause of action, Congress said

10

inaccuracy is so clearly harmful that it should be

11

actionable in any case, it couldn't  it's just not

12

possible to look at the  the way the statute was

13

constructed and say that that was so.

14

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, how much more do you

15

think the plaintiff in this case would have to allege or

16

prove in order to show injury in fact?

17

            MR. PINCUS:  I think if the plaintiff could

18

show that  that there was some  some consequence to

19

him, some  from the false information:  Something

20

happened to his credit.  Something happened to an

21

employment 

22

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But that's a really hard

23

thing to do, Mr. Pincus.

24

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, there's actually 

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  People get these reports,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

and you don't know what they're doing with these

2

reports.  They might have not given you a job for that

3

reason, or they might have not given you a job for some

4

other reason.  They might have not given you credit for

5

that reason, or they might have not given you credit for

6

some other reason.

7

            I mean, it's actually the quintessential

8

kind of injury that you will never be able to detect and

9

surely not to prove.

10

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure

11

that's so.  I mean, I think defamation claims are

12

exactly the same situation.  People don't know

13

necessarily.  If  if the  if the statement is not

14

defamation per se, people have to go out and find proof,

15

or at least find 

16

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose  I suppose the

17

argument underlying some of the questions you've been

18

asked assumes this:  If neighbors are making false

19

comments, talking about someone, this is not actionable

20

enough unless it's defamation.

21

            On the Internet with  in this cyber age

22

that we have where all this information is out,

23

there's  there's  has to be some real injury.

24

            Is it different because this is a credit

25

agency that is regulated?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

            Does a credit agency have less latitude when

2

it is defending on the ground of no concrete injury than

3

other entities?

4

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think there's a

5

threshold question, Your Honor, of whether Congress made

6

the determination that there should be a different

7

treatment for  for credit agencies.  And I think for

8

the reason that I gave about how the willfulness claim

9

came into the statute, it's hard to say.

10

            But I think also 

11

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But does the statute apply

12

just to crediting?  That's what  that's what I was

13

asking.

14

            MR. PINCUS:  It does.  Although, one of the

15

realworld litigation problems with this statute is that

16

lots of the claims are asserted against entities that

17

claim they're not credit agencies.  And that sort of, in

18

the realworld of litigation, falls out, is not

19

something that often gets decided before the class gets

20

certified.

21

            But I think it's important to 

22

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's not disputed in

23

this case.

24

            MR. PINCUS:  Excuse me?

25

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It may have been disputed

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

at an earlier stage, but now it's accepted that the

2

defendant is a credit reporting agency.

3

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, it hasn't been ruled on

4

by the lower court.  So as the case comes to this Court,

5

yes, that's 

6

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We must assume that

7

that's true.

8

            MR. PINCUS:   that's the  that's the

9

posture.

10

            But  but I think, going back to

11

Justice Kennedy's question, I think what Congress did

12

here was to create a massive number of regulatory

13

requirements that are imposed on credit reporting

14

agencies.  And all of those regulatory requirements

15

together were supposed to produce accuracy.

16

            I  I think there can't be a  it's not

17

logical to impute to Congress a finding that the

18

violation of any one of those many, many, many

19

requirements is actionable 

20

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that 

21

            MR. PINCUS:   in the absence of real harm.

22

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that, though, a

23

question of the application of the statute?

24

            MR. PINCUS:  No.  I think 

25

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It doesn't invalidate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

the injury here because this is the quintessential

2

violation of the statute.

3

            He's saying they don't have reasonable

4

procedures to check their accuracy.  We know from the

5

purpose section of the statute that that's what Congress

6

wanted, reasonable procedures.  He's going to have to

7

prove that.

8

            Number two, he says, the information about

9

me is false.  I'm going to assume, for purposes of this

10

argument, because we have to, that  and so does the

11

court below with respect to standing  that much of

12

that information is inaccurate.

13

            I will tell you that I know plenty of single

14

people who look at whether someone who's proposed to

15

date is married or not.  So if you're not married and

16

there's a report out there saying you are, that's a

17

potential injury.

18

            Now, I know the court below said it was

19

speculative, but that's what Congress was worried about:

20

both creditworthiness, and  and your stature as a

21

person, your privacy, your sense of self; that I can

22

identify myself with some  others can identify me with

23

some accuracy.

24

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, respectfully  I'm

25

sorry.

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So I guess my question

2

is, we've now taken a word, "concreteness," that the

3

Court in recent years has applied to injuries by

4

citizens and when they can bring actions or not.  A

5

generalized grievance, we said, of a taxpayer is not

6

concrete enough.

7

            We've taken this doctrine, and you're trying

8

to superimpose the word "concrete" into legallycreated

9

rights.  But for  for two decades  on, I mean, two

10

centuries, we've always said in our case law that injury

11

in fact is the breach of a legallyrecognized right.

12

            Where do we have a right?  I think that's

13

Justice Kagan's question.

14

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.

15

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  It's a requirement.

16

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Why don't you answer

17

Justice Sotomayor's question first?

18

            MR. PINCUS:  Respectfully, I don't think

19

that the cases say that.  We discuss them in detail in

20

our  in our blue brief.

21

            I think what the Court said in Warth and

22

Linda R.S. was about what the Court said in Lujan, which

23

is, de facto injuries, as to which there's no cause of

24

action, can be made actionable when Congress creates a

25

cause of action.  That's quite different from saying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

that something that doesn't qualify under this Court's

2

injuryinfact standard as tangible harm can be made

3

actionable, which is what the Ninth Circuit decided

4

here.

5

            And I also  I want to also 

6

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I agree with you

7

entirely on that.

8

            MR. PINCUS:  Okay.  Can I just 

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Go ahead.

10

            MR. PINCUS:  I  I just want to also sort

11

of distinguish  in responding to your question, I

12

think there are two questions.  One  one question is:

13

Is a false statement  does a false statement by itself

14

inflict tangible harm within the meaning of this Court's

15

generallyapplicable injuryinfact standard?  If it

16

does, it does.  The Court has never said that, and we

17

argue that it doesn't.

18

            The second question is:  Can Congress expand

19

beyond where the Court has gone in defining things that

20

should qualify a sufficient injury to trigger

21

Article III jurisdiction?

22

            And we think there are two questions there.

23

One is:  Has Congress, in fact, done that?  And there's

24

a question whether Congress has done that at all.

25

            And I think Justice Kennedy, in his

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

concurrence in Lujan, said if Congress is going to do

2

that, it should say clearly because that obviously is a

3

change in the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.

4

            And so Congress might be taken to 

5

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Congress does it by doing

6

it, you know?  Congress doesn't announce exactly 

7

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, I'm not sure 

8

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   here we are, we're just

9

going beyond the common law.  It just does it.  And 

10

and it does it  and it did it here.

11

            It said, you know, what are we concerned

12

about?  We're concerned about following the kinds of

13

procedures that will make sure that there are accurate

14

credit reports.  And then Congress told you exactly why

15

in the purposes section of the statute.  And my gosh,

16

it's all over the legislative history.

17

            The most serious problem in the credit

18

reporting industry, Congress says, is the problem of

19

inaccurate and misleading information.

20

            MR. PINCUS:  Well 

21

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And  and so Congress has

22

clearly done that here.

23

            And I guess I  if you want to just explain

24

to me why it is that Congress can't do  I think we've

25

said that Congress can do that, can go beyond the common

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

law, and certainly can go beyond anything that we've

2

ever said is a concrete harm as long as they've

3

identified a concrete harm.

4

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, a couple of responses to

5

that.  If it's a concrete harm in the first place, of

6

course, then they haven't really gone beyond this

7

Court's test.

8

            I  I think  Let me 

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Of course, harms can arise

10

in the world, and can be identified in the world even

11

though they haven't arisen before, or been identified

12

before.

13

            MR. PINCUS:  But the  but the Court's  I

14

think the question  and I take the burden of my

15

friend's argument to be that Congress can define things

16

as sufficient to satisfy standing, even if they

17

wouldn't, if they just were asserted at a court,

18

satisfied the tangible harm requirement.

19

            So I  I guess, to respond to your

20

question 

21

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  If you're saying that, I

22

agree with you.

23

            MR. PINCUS:  Okay.  Well, then  well, I

24

think then the district court here held that that

25

tangible harm requirement wasn't satisfied.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Pincus, I would have

2

thought that your answer to Justice Kagan would have

3

been Congress did not identify, as the harm for which it

4

allowed suit to be brought, misinformation.  It did not.

5

It identified as the harm the failure to follow the 

6

the procedures that it imposed upon credit reporting

7

agencies.

8

            It said nothing about people who  who have

9

been hurt by misinformation being able to sue.  It said

10

anybody can sue who's been reported on if the agency

11

failed to use the procedures.

12

            So in fact, Congress has not identified

13

misinformation as a suable harm.  That's not what this

14

statute does.

15

            MR. PINCUS:  And I apologize if I haven't

16

been clear.  That is exactly 

17

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't that your answer?

18

            MR. PINCUS:  That is exactly our argument 

19

            (Laughter.)

20

            MR. PINCUS:   that Congress here created a

21

remedy for any regulatory violation.  And many, many,

22

many, many 

23

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why did Congress do

24

that, Mr. Pincus?  Congress did that 

25

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, can I 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   Congress did that as a

2

safe harbor.

3

            We are not  it's a kind of

4

industryfriendly act that Congress did.  It said we're

5

not going to punish any old inaccuracy.  We're giving

6

you a safe harbor.  If  as long as you followed a

7

certain set of procedures, don't worry about it.

8

            But did that procedural requirement  this

9

is  this is exactly what Lujan says, "It's a

10

procedural requirement, the disregard of which could

11

impair a concrete interest of the plaintiff."

12

            And we distinguished that from procedural

13

requirements in vacuo.

14

            MR. PINCUS:  Well 

15

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And that's what this is.

16

It's a procedural requirement, the disregard of which

17

can impair your interest in being represented accurately

18

in credit reports.

19

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, there is some problems

20

with that, Your Honor.  I mean, there are many of the 

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  That  that

22

would lead to the conclusion that anybody can sue 

23

            MR. PINCUS:  Exactly.

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:   not just somebody who 

25

whose information was  was wrong.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

            MR. PINCUS:  Because most of the 

2

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.

3

            MR. PINCUS:  If I may, Your Honor.

4

            Most of the statutory and regulatory

5

requirements have nothing to do with falsity.  They have

6

to do with not following rules.  There's nothing in the

7

cause of action that says you can only sue for

8

willfulness if you  if the statement is false.  It

9

says any willful violation of this entire regulatory

10

statute.

11

            So the idea that Congress 

12

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  "Any person who

13

willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed

14

upon this subjecter with respect to any consumer is

15

liable to that consumer."

16

            So it's not the whole world; it's the

17

consumer that you dealt with 

18

            MR. PINCUS:  But, Your Honor 

19

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   or that the agency 

20

that the agency dealt with.

21

            MR. PINCUS:  But, Your Honor, if the

22

argument is that by enacting that, Congress meant to

23

identify as a harm false statements, there's nothing

24

that requires proof of a false or inaccurate statement

25

in order to bring the claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but, Mr. Pincus, the

2

gravamen of this claim, as I said, and as more

3

importantly, as  as the  the Respondent has said, is

4

in 1681(e), which does talk about accuracy.  And it

5

makes it clear that the procedures are linked to

6

accuracy.

7

            And I totally take your point that, well,

8

how about the person who there's  there's been no

9

inaccuracy.  Well, that person does not have standing.

10

That person cannot come in and say that he's suffered a

11

concrete injury.  But the person who has been

12

inaccurately represented can come in and say he's

13

suffered exactly the concrete injury that this statute

14

is designed to protect against.

15

            MR. PINCUS:  But  but, Your Honor, I don't

16

see how you can say that a cause of action that says

17

nothing about inaccuracy applies to a previously

18

enacted  one of the many provisions of the statute, to

19

create  to say that Congress was focused on

20

inaccuracies.

21

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you  are you

22

saying 

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Kennedy.

24

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Are you saying in this

25

case that Congress could have drafted a statute that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

would allow this individual to bring suit?

2

            MR. PINCUS:  I think Congress  yes, I

3

think it might be possible.  And let me explain how,

4

Justice Kennedy.

5

            I think, first of all, to respond to one of

6

Justice Kagan's earlier questions, I don't think it's

7

crystal clear what Congress was doing here because I

8

think the most likely interpretation of this provision

9

was it was enacted against the background of this

10

Court's jurisprudence, which requires tangible harm.

11

            And it  what Congress was most likely

12

saying was, we know that quantifying, monetizing that

13

tangible harm in this context is hard.  So if there's a

14

willful violation, we're going to give you a minimum

15

recovery.

16

            I think the reason why it makes sense to

17

require Congress to speak clearly, if it is going beyond

18

what this Court has required for tangible harm, is

19

precisely because it is necessary to identify that

20

Congress actually intends to give access to the Federal

21

courts beyond that which would be true under this

22

Court's otherwise applicable jurisdiction  rule.  And

23

it didn't do that here because of the willfulness

24

layered on top of all of the statutory violations.

25

            And I think also, the fair way of looking at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

this statute is as a complex of regulations which

2

Congress thought, taken together, would improve

3

accuracy.

4

            I don't think you can say that any single

5

one of them  the violation of any single one of them,

6

Congress thought, was going to so likely to inflict

7

injury on some person that they should be entitled to 

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do all of them go to

9

accuracy, or 

10

            MR. PINCUS:  No.

11

            JUSTICE SCALIA:   do some of them go to

12

privacy and other matters?

13

            MR. PINCUS:  Most of  one is about having

14

an 800 number available.  One has to do with notice

15

to  to people who look at information 

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And that would be a

17

violation, right, if  if you didn't provide that?

18

            MR. PINCUS:  Under  under 

19

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And  and presumably

20

anybody, if  if you believe Respondent, anybody who 

21

whose information is not accurate can sue to get the

22

statutory damages for failure to provide an 800 number.

23

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think Respondents would

24

say even if the information was accurate, you could sue

25

to get the statutory damages.  I think Justice Kagan

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

might limit it to people who were inaccurately 

2

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, I  when

3

we normally have a standing inquiry, you  there can be

4

some people who have standing under a particular statute

5

and some who don't.

6

            Is  is your position simply that you have

7

to look at whether the plaintiffs have been injured in

8

fact, and that some plaintiffs will be able to proceed

9

if they can make that showing and others may not?

10

            MR. PINCUS:  Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice;

11

that's our position.  That's  and the district court

12

held in this case, looking at the allegations of the

13

complaint, that the Court's injuryinfact standard

14

wasn't satisfied by the Ninth Circuit 

15

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, was this 

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  By the particular

17

violation?  Injured in fact by the particular 

18

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.

19

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Not by failure to have an

20

800 number, you're saying?

21

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  No.  But would this man be

22

able?  I mean, this is very much in line with the Chief

23

Justice's.

24

            Would he be able to sue based on the fact

25

that there was inaccurate information about him?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

            MR. PINCUS:  No, because the district court

2

found that all of the allegations of  all of his

3

arguments about why there was any tangible harm to him

4

were speculative and flunked this Court's standard.

5

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Pincus 

6

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I guess  I guess what I 

7

that's okay.

8

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before you sit down,

9

the  the brief suggests that the real danger of

10

allowing this kind of action is that it  it will be

11

brought on behalf of a class, and you could get millions

12

of plaintiffs and billions of dollars.

13

            If we should hold that Congress can give

14

consumers a right to redress for false credit reporting,

15

if we held that, would you have grounds to oppose

16

certification of a class.

17

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, I think the problem here,

18

Your Honor, is if you accept the broad theory that

19

plaintiffs and the government espouse, which is all you

20

have to show is a statutory violation, it's a pretty

21

clear pathway to class certification because there is

22

only common issues.  And that's what has happened in

23

case after case.

24

            Now, if falsity has to be proven, then

25

obviously that is an individualized issue that might

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

make it more difficult.

2

            I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

3

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, Counsel.

4

            Mr. Consovoy.

5

          ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM S. CONSOVOY

6

               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court:

9

            Mr. Robins has Article III standing for

10

three independent reasons.

11

            First, the violation of the statutory rights

12

under the Fair Credit Reporting Act constitutes injury

13

in fact.

14

            Second, even if not, his entitlement to

15

monetary relief as a consequence of that violation shows

16

he has the personal stake that Article III requires.

17

            And third, the fact that his claim follows

18

from the common law of defamation conclusively

19

establishes that it is a case or controversy within the

20

meaning of Article III.

21

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  your  your number

22

two  I mean, we can  it sounds to me quite circular.

23

You say  you say he  he has a personal stake because

24

he has a  because Congress said he has a personal

25

stake.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

            Is  do I understand your argument?

2

            MR. CONSOVOY:  I view it just like a

3

contract case.  So if this were a contract instead of a

4

statute, and the same duties and liabilities came to be,

5

and it was a liquidated damages clause, he had a duty

6

that was violated; he had an entitlement to money.

7

            The one thing the Court would not do in that

8

case is look behind the entitlement to see whether he

9

really was harmed in some other way than other 

10

otherwise being owed the money.

11

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  All Congress has to do is

12

provide for damages, right?

13

            MR. CONSOVOY:  No.  It has to do much more

14

than that.

15

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well 

16

            MR. CONSOVOY:  It has to still create an

17

interest, a discrete, legal interest that's personal to

18

him; that only  that is not a generalized grievance;

19

that is not undifferentiated harm.  It has to do all of

20

those same things.

21

            The  the point where we get 

22

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But  but that is a harm.

23

It is a harm.  And you said it's a harm because he  he

24

can't get the money that he was provided.  But that's

25

circular.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So  so the harm  the

2

violation of a legallyvested interest at common law in

3

this Court's decisions throughout has always been deemed

4

a concrete harm.

5

            Going back to Tennessee Electric where the

6

Court narrowly used to say that a legal right was an

7

injury.  Then, in Camp, the Court expanded beyond that

8

to say no, practical injuries too can be legal injuries.

9

But it never negated the earlier, more difficult test.

10

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about a law

11

that says you get a  $10,000 statutory damages if a

12

company publishes inaccurate information about you?

13

            You want  you have an unlisted phone

14

number.  You don't want people calling you.  The company

15

publishes your phone number, but it's wrong.  That is

16

inaccurate information about you, but you have no injury

17

whatever.

18

            Can that person bring an action for that

19

statutory damage?

20

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Congress has a lot of work to

21

do there.

22

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry?

23

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Congress has a great deal of

24

work it needs to do to show 

25

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But  but can you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

have  do you have standing?

2

            Do you have injury in fact when you don't

3

want people calling you; the company publishes a false

4

telephone number.

5

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So the call 

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Whether Congress has

7

a lot of work or not, at the end of the day, can you

8

recover those statutory damages?

            MR. CONSOVOY:  If Congress identified the

10

interest of you receiving a phone call, and that's the

11

injury, and you don't receive the phone call, you

12

haven't suffered the injury Congress identified.

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no, no.  I'm

14

sorry.

15

            MR. CONSOVOY:  I'm sorry.

16

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The injury they

17

identify is we don't think companies should public

18

false  publish false information about you.

19

            Is it the end of the standing inquiry to say

20

they published false information about me, or do you

21

have to ask were you injured in some way by that

22

publication?

23

            MR. CONSOVOY:  No.  The  Congress has done

24

its job there.

25

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So it's in  so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

what  what would you say the injury in fact, not in

2

law but in fact, is in that case?

3

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So I don't think the

4

contradistinction is between an injury in fact and an

5

injury in law.  A legallyvested interest, whether it's

6

created by Congress or created by the common law, is

7

itself a concrete injury.

8

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But our cases have

9

always said actual injury in fact.  And I thought that

10

meant that that was different than actual injury in law.

11

            You're saying when we say injury in fact, we

12

really mean injury in fact or injury in law?

13

            MR. CONSOVOY:  No.  I  I don't really

14

think there is a term "injury in law."  I  I've not

15

seen it in the cases.

16

            What I do see, going back to Camp, which is

17

the first case that uses the phrase "injury in fact,"

18

that concept was designed to get at two really important

19

things:

20

            One, that the harm is not speculative.  And

21

not to play word games, but I think it means that you

22

are, in fact, injured, as opposed to that you have

23

actually been injured.

24

            And the second, that it's not a generalized

25

grievance.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, but 

2

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That's a very

3

different question.  I understand generalized grievance.

4

You can't just say  even I think you gather  any

5

citizen in the United States can sue about this.  You

6

have to particularize it to some extent.

7

            But that's a different question as to

8

whether there's actual injury.

9

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So I think the  the Court

10

uses the phrase "concrete and particularized."  That's

11

two companion words, I think, getting at these same

12

concepts.

13

            Now, two things have to happen:  One, to

14

show that it's a differentiated claim, that it's not a

15

generalized grievance, you have to identify a subclass

16

of people who are distinctly harmed other than the

17

general population.  That's the concrete part.  That's

18

what Schlesinger says.

19

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, I would think that's

20

the particularized part.

21

            MR. CONSOVOY:  The particularized part is

22

that you're among those people.  You need both things.

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But how in the

24

Chief Justice's 

25

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But  but the law 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Concrete  concrete has

2

nothing to do with particularized.  It means it is  it

3

is  the only way to put it is an injury in fact.  It's

4

a 

5

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And I was going to say,

6

the  the Lujan case says de facto, which is actual,

7

existing in fact, having effect, even though not

8

formally or legally recognized.

9

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So  yes.  And then the

10

concurring opinion explained that it didn't  your

11

concurring opinion, Your Honor, said that it  Congress

12

could also play a role in that in identifying those

13

injuries.  And here it did.

14

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, but this is my own

15

view of this, maybe no one else's.  But you sound as if

16

you're describing a forum of what used to be called the

17

"public action," of which there were no such examples in

18

Federal law.  Most states have them.  And because you

19

want people who aren't hurt in fact to be able to sue.

20

            And the example here is not just the

21

Chief Justice's, which is one, but the more immediate

22

example, which seems to be in this case  I didn't

23

think it was but it now seems to be  are people 

24

perhaps not this plaintiff  but people who in fact

25

notice that someone like the defendant has filed bad

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

procedures leading to false information.  And those

2

people who were not injured bring a lawsuit, and they

3

say they're following bad information.  That's it.  Bad

4

procedure.  And Congress gave me a hundred dollars, so

5

give it to me.

6

            Now, that's the person I didn't know was in

7

this case, because this plaintiff seems to argue

8

specific discrepancies in fact that, in all likelihood,

9

hurt him.  Okay?  But we're leaving him out of it.

10

            Now, I want to know what the government

11

thinks of the case I've just put.

12

            Do  does the government think a person who

13

admits nobody said anything wrong about me, they did say

14

something about me, it was all correct, but they are

15

using bad, bad in  practices for assembling consumer

16

information 

17

            In the government's view, does the person in

18

my hypothetical, similar to the Chief's, maybe

19

identical, does he or does he not have standing?  Yes or

20

no?

21

            MR. CONSOVOY:  I'll be responding to you:

22

He does not.

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.  If you say he does

24

not, then we are limiting this case to the case of

25

people who are victims of not just bad practices but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

false information about them, and that's what the words

2

"with respect to any consumer" mean.

3

            MR. CONSOVOY:  That 

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  They mean any consumer who

5

has obtained  who suffers from false information.

6

            MR. CONSOVOY:  That 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  If that's the government's

8

position, then it's not a public action.  It's a private

9

action.

10

            MR. CONSOVOY:  That is  that is

11

Respondent's position.

12

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  That's 

13

            JUSTICE ALITO:  In relation to that 

14

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   that  that's 

15

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Could I just say 

16

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Justice Alito.

17

            JUSTICE ALITO:  In relation to that, can I

18

just ask you something about that, that goes to how

19

Spokeo operates:  Is there anything here to indicate

20

that anybody other than Mr. Robins ever did a search for

21

him?

22

            (Laughter.)

23

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Not in the record that I'm

24

aware of.

25

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Then how could  then isn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

that quintessential speculative harm?

2

            In my understanding  you  correct me if

3

I'm wrong  you don't have files someplace for every

4

person in the United States or  you have databases,

5

and you will do a search if somebody asks you to do a

6

search.

7

            I assume you wouldn't say that somebody as

8

to whom there never had been a search would have

9

standing, right?  Even if  you know, even if it would

10

be the case that if there was a search it would come up

11

with a lot of false information.

12

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So for it to be a consumer

13

report, there must be communication to a third party.

14

So we have alleged communication to third parties.  At

15

the pleadings stage, that must be accepted as true at

16

this point.

17

            But Spokeo, I believe, on their website,

18

does not share that information who searched for you.

19

And this  this is really important.  It is almost

20

impossible to know.

21

            If he applied for a job with a major

22

employer in this country who had 5,000 job applicants,

23

and they pulled his report, here is what Spokeo is

24

selling:  We are the arbiter of truth.  If it says he

25

went to College A on his resume, and we tell you he went

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

to College B, he is a liar.  If  if he says he is 30

2

years old and we say he is 55 years old, he is a liar.

3

            That is their business.  That is what they

4

are selling.

5

            There is no way 

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought they had

7

some  I thought they had some disclaimer that Spokeo

8

does not verify or evaluate each piece of data, It makes

9

no warranties or guarantees about any of the information

10

offer  offered.

11

            MR. CONSOVOY:  And  and 

12

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How is that saying

13

if it's not accurate you're a  he's a liar?

14

            MR. CONSOVOY:  And  and then it sells 

15

then it promotes its  its service  and this is in

16

the FTC report and also in the complaint  to human

17

resources executives saying, if you want to run employee

18

checks, come to us.

19

            It would be a strange business if they said,

20

Come to us, but who knows if what we're telling you is

21

true.

22

            And  and 

23

            (Laughter.)

24

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think that's what

25

the disclaimer is saying.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

            MR. CONSOVOY:  But the  whether the

2

disclaimer is valid  well, that is 

3

            (Laughter.)

4

            MR. CONSOVOY:   that is exactly what the

5

disclaimer says, but of course, Congress stepped into

6

the breach 

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You've got to do the best

8

you can, you know?  I mean 

9

            MR. CONSOVOY:  I'm sorry?

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I said you've got to do the

11

best you can.

12

            MR. CONSOVOY:  You do.  We all do.

13

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The person who hires

14

somebody, if  if they all have this disclaimer, which

15

I expect they all do, you  you either go without any

16

information or you accept one of them.

17

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Except Congress stepped in

18

and said, if you are operating as a consumer reporting

19

agency, you have duties and responsibilities.

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I want to ask about what

21

you think Congress did.

22

            You're  you're saying it's limited to 

23

to people about whom false information has been given.

24

Suppose Congress enacts a statute that says everybody

25

has a right to sue for exorbitant expenditures by the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

Department of Defense.  This affects everybody, you

2

know, the $900 toilet seat and so forth.  Everybody can

3

sue.  That clearly would not be allowable.

4

            But suppose somebody is a  a disappointed

5

bidder for the toilet seat, and he sues under that

6

statute.  And he said, oh, yes, the statute didn't 

7

didn't just say the disappointed bidders can sue, or

8

that anybody who's proximally affected can sue.  It said

9

that everybody can sue.  But I, in fact, have been

10

proximally injured, and therefore, I ought to be able to

11

sue.

12

            Do you think that would be true?

13

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Likely not.  Likely not, and

14

here's why 

15

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, why is this case any

16

different?  You're  you're saying only people who have

17

been injured, assuming that  that false information is

18

injury  only they can sue.  But the statute doesn't

19

say that only they can sue.  It says that everybody

20

about whom Spokeo did  did a report can sue.

21

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So it says  this statute

22

does things that the hypothetical statute does not.

23

This statute says, starting with the cause of action, if

24

you have done something that violates a statute with

25

respect to a specific consumer, that consumer can sue

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

you.

2

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

3

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Then second  then you look

4

in the provision that we are basing the claim on here,

5

the reasonable procedures provision.

6

            So that provision in particular, which is

7

the only one 

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That's fine.

9

            MR. CONSOVOY:   before the Court 

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where do you get the  the

11

necessity of injury in fact?

12

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So why 

13

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where do you get the

14

necessity that there has been false information which

15

you assert is there?

16

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So it says, "reasonable

17

procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy. "

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Procedures to ensure

19

maximum.  That doesn't mean there has to be accuracy.

20

            MR. CONSOVOY:  No.  Congress actually did

21

something better for the industry.  They gave them a

22

limitation on liability.  So Congress thought about

23

giving strict liability here.

24

            And keep in mind, Justice Scalia, Congress

25

preempted almost all State law claims here.  They

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

preempted State law defamation.  So the notion that this

2

isn't about defamation when they preempted State law

3

defamation strikes me as a very different argument.

4

            So you're only in Federal court, and that

5

Congress said we could impose strict liability.

6

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You have to say, don't you,

7

in answer to Justice Scalia, that the words, "follow

8

reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible

9

accuracy in respect to any consumer," the one who can

10

sue, means that the  when you fail to do it in respect

11

to a consumer, you say something false about that

12

consumer.  It doesn't use those words, and we would have

13

to so construe it in order to save the constitutionality

14

of the statute.

15

            MR. CONSOVOY:  And every lower court to

16

reach this question has held that 

17

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that wouldn't be true.

18

You could fail to  to follow the procedures and still

19

come up with accurate information, like you could not

20

have an 800 number.

21

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Correct, and that person

22

would not have standing.

23

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's impossible to read it

24

that way because it's simply not true.

25

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So, Justice Scalia 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

            (Laughter.)

2

            MR. CONSOVOY:  every lower court to reach

3

this question has held that this particular provision

4

requires falsity as an allegation.  Multiple Courts of

5

Appeals.

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But I want to  as

7

I understand  I take the falsity out of the  the

8

hypotheticals to get exactly what your position is on

9

the  the breadth of Congress' power.

10

            So let's say the statute says anybody who's

11

publishing information about you has to pay the

12

individual $10 a year.  They think that's a good way to

13

regulate it.  It's information about you, good, bad, or

14

indifferent, pay them $10 a year, no more, no less.

15

Spokeo, or whatever that business is, pays you $20 one

16

year.

17

            Now you've been  the statute has been

18

violated with respect to you, a particular individual.

19

Can that  and there's statutory damages of $10,000.

20

            Can that individual sue?

21

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So 

22

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Now, does that

23

individual have injury in fact because the statute has

24

been violated with respect to him?

25

            MR. CONSOVOY:  That, I think no, because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

that statute would apply to everybody in the country.

2

There would be no 

3

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Oh, no, no, no.  You

4

have to have published information about an individual.

5

Every individual who you publish information about gets

6

$10 a year.

7

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Right.  So I think that would

8

make it particularized but not concrete.

9

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So there'd be no

10

standing  that person would have no standing, even

11

though Congress gave him standing?

12

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Congress can confer

13

substantive rights that lead to standing.

14

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes.

15

            MR. CONSOVOY:  But not everything Congress

16

does will convey a substantive right that differentiates

17

you from the general population.

18

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So if the statute 

19

            MR. CONSOVOY:  This one does.

20

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   says $10, no

21

more, no less, he gets $20, does he have standing to sue

22

under that statute?

23

            MR. CONSOVOY:  I don't think so, because it

24

would apply so broadly to everybody 

25

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  No, no, no.  Any 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

you have  I said this just before.  They have to have

2

published information about you.  If they don't, they

3

don't have to pay you anything.

4

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Right.  And my  my answer

5

is that that would make it particularized but not

6

concrete.

7

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't there always a

8

materiality question?

9

            In every violation there's always a

10

materiality question:  What is the falsehood?  Is it

11

material to anything?  It could be a transposition of a

12

telephone number.

13

            MR. CONSOVOY:  That's right.  There is a

14

de minimis aspect to the statute as well.  But even 

15

well, that is right, and even innocuous things can also

16

cause 

17

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Consovoy, can I just

18

make sure I understand?

19

            You said you  you need for the information

20

to be inaccurate to have standing here.  That is going

21

to mean that the class, as you've defined it, is not

22

going to be certified.  And I think that that's the

23

right answer, but I just want to make sure that we're on

24

the  we're on the same page here.

25

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Yes.  So the class was  and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

this is going to come up later this term in the Tyson

2

case.  But the class has to be defined as broadly as it

3

was because of what's called a failsafe problem.

4

            You can't identify a class by an element of

5

the cause of action, and that's because it harms

6

defendants' rights.  So if we had alleged the class here

7

was everybody who had inaccurate information, it would

8

be a trick against them, because if they defeated the

9

claim, the class would be empty, and they would get no

10

res judicata.

11

            So at certification, we're going to have to

12

narrow the class, and we're going to have to come up

13

with common proof because we can't identify the class by

14

the allegation.

15

            So what happens is, take the algorithm

16

issue.  So we will have to allege under (b)(3),

17

23(b)(3), that a common algorithm led to all the

18

inaccuracies.  But if they do, that is a certifiable

19

class.

20

            And just 

21

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And one very quick thing.

22

You said in your brief you're really only suing under

23

1681(e)(B).

24

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Uhhuh.

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Can I understand that to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that you're waiving all claims of other things?

2

            MR. CONSOVOY:  No.  I think  and let me

3

explain.  We read the statute this way:  There's A

4

reasonable procedures requirement.  That is a general

5

framework.  Some of that is discussed in the regulatory

6

commentary, explains what that is.  But the specific

7

things mentioned in Count I, Count II, and Count III,

8

the furnisher notices, the user notices, and the

9

tollfree number are specific examples of reasonable

10

procedures they failed to follow.

11

            They support 

12

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you saying 

13

            MR. CONSOVOY:   the general claim.

14

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you saying you get

15

the statutory damages for the four claims that you

16

listed, or is it only what you've called the overarching

17

claim?

18

            And in one footnote you said these other

19

claims are  are just supportive of the main claim.

20

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Right.

21

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So are you asking for

22

four times the statutory damages, or are you saying, no,

23

this is really one  one claim, and so we're asking for

24

$100 dollars a head, or 10,000  or for $1000 a head?

25

            MR. CONSOVOY:  It's  it's one claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49

And 

2

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It's one claim.

3

            MR. CONSOVOY:  It is  yes, Your Honor.

4

            Now, these are bigpicture questions, but

5

this case can be resolved on a much narrower issue.

6

            This Court has always held that if the cause

7

of action you allege can be found in the common law, and

8

is developed from the common law as in Stevens, that you

9

have standing.  This claim for false information follows

10

directly from the common law defamation.

11

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The Ninth Circuit

12

didn't address that question, did it?  I mean, as I

13

understand it, I'm looking at the footnote, you know, on

14

page 9A, it says it doesn't matter because you  the

15

statutory injury in law is enough.

16

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Right.  No.  Well, but the

17

statute follows from defamation.  Just as in Stevens, it

18

was about the statute, it wasn't about the particular

19

individual.  They said the qui tam statute followed from

20

the common law there, just like this statute follows

21

from the common law defamation.

22

            And remember 

23

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  How does it

24

follow from the common law of defamation?  I mean,

25

you  you could not bring a defamation action because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

somebody said something false about you.  It was either

2

in one of those areas where it is presumed to be

3

damaging, you know, such as it's, you know, about your

4

moral life or something like that, or  or your

5

incompetence in your profession, or else you had to show

6

positive damage.

7

            How can you say 

8

            MR. CONSOVOY:  So 

9

            JUSTICE SCALIA:   that it's from common

10

law.

11

            MR. CONSOVOY:   in Steel Co., Your Honor,

12

the Court said it must be in the tradition of the common

13

law of the sort, not precisely replicated.

14

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, I see.  Okay.

15

            MR. CONSOVOY:  Not precisely replicated.

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Close enough.  Okay.

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

20

    ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

21

                  SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

22

            MR. STEWART:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23

please the Court:

24

            In Defenders of Wildlife, the Court gave the

25

following description of what injury in fact means:  It

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

said injury in fact is, quote, "an invasion of a

2

legallyprotected interest which is, A, concrete and

3

particularized, and, B, actual or imminent, not

4

conjectural or hypothetical."

5

            And so the injury part of it was the

6

invasion of a legallyprotected injury  interest.  And

7

I think it's clear what work the words "in fact" are

8

doing in that description.

9

            If Mr. Robins had alleged that Spokeo is

10

circulating a lot of inaccurate consumer reports and I'm

11

afraid they'll do one about me, that wouldn't be good

12

enough.  That 

13

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What  what happened to

14

"concrete and particularized"?

15

            MR. STEWART:  Well, particularized 

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  We  we say that in 

17

in  in, gee, a whole lot of cases.  And  and that

18

didn't appear in that quote you gave?

19

            MR. STEWART:  It did.  It's 

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Say it again.

21

            MR. STEWART:   "actual or eminent" 

22

well, "concrete and particularized" and "actual or

23

imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical."

24

            And the Court has explained both the terms

25

"concrete" and "particularized" as aspects of the  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

requirement that the wrong be done to the particular

2

plaintiff, not that it be done to the community as a

3

whole.

4

            And the Court used the terms that way in

5

Schlesinger.  I don't 

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Stewart, let's

7

say your  your  Congress thinks that the president

8

is not doing enough to stop illegal immigration.  So it

9

passes a law that says, anyone in a border state  so

10

it's particularized  who is unemployed may bring an

11

action against an illegal immigrant who has a job.  And

12

they get damages, maybe they get an injunction.

13

            Can Congress do that?

14

            MR. STEWART:  Well, I think there would be a

15

couple of different problems with that.  The first would

16

be that there may be some  there may be some legal

17

issues that Congress can't simply delegate to private

18

enforcement that are  like the  the criminal law,

19

for instance.  There would be constitutional 

20

potential constitutional 

21

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I think that's

22

kind of avoiding the hypothetical.  I mean, let's 

23

            (Laughter.)

24

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But presumably you

25

would raise those issues after the action's been filed,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

and  and, you know, you could raise those issues as an

2

amicus defending the action.

3

            MR. STEWART:  I mean, I think that would 

4

typically when Congress has done this, and in all the

5

common law analogues that we've cited, the  the class

6

of people who could file suit would be people whom the

7

prohibited conduct had a natural tendency to harm.

8

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Yes, we're talking

9

about Congress says, Well, these people who are

10

unemployed, illegal immigrants have jobs, they should be

11

able to sue to stop that because the  you know,

12

because they  Congress thinks the president isn't

13

doing enough.

14

            MR. STEWART:  I mean, I think it would be 

15

I think that would stretch the limits of Congress's

16

power to  to treat those  that broad class of

17

individuals as victims of all acts of illegal

18

immigration.  And obviously the statute in  that we're

19

dealing with here doesn't come anywhere close to that.

20

            And  and I understand the Court's concerns

21

with the implications of our position, but I think it's

22

also worth pointing out, this is a mode of enforcement

23

that Congress has been using since 1790.

24

            In the first Copyright Act, Congress enacted

25

a provision that said if there is infringement, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

copyright owner can get actual damages if he can prove

2

them, or failing that, he 

3

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I mean, you know

4

the  you know the objection behind  behind my

5

hypothetical.

6

            MR. STEWART:  Yes.

7

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Which is Congress

8

can say, basically, to a group of citizens, you get to

9

enforce one of our laws because we're giving you a cause

10

of action.  It doesn't matter whether you've actually

11

been injured or not; we just have to particularize it to

12

some extent.

13

            And I would have thought that the  the

14

president would be concerned about Congress being able

15

to create its own enforcement mechanism.  I thought that

16

you would be concerned that that would interfere with

17

the executive's prerogatives.

18

            MR. STEWART:  I  I think when we get to

19

the point of  of the hypothetical where any unemployed

20

person in the State is treated as the legal vitamin of

21

every act of unlawful immigration that occurs into that

22

State, we  we do have concerns.

23

            But the  the statute we're dealing with

24

here says 

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The statute we're dealing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

with here treats everybody about whom false information

2

has been given as somebody about whom false information

3

that harms him has been given.

4

            I mean, the class is not  is not

5

coextensive with those  those that are harmed.  And

6

it's the same  it's the same in  in the

7

Chief Justice's hypothetical:  The class is not

8

coextensive with everybody who has been  who has been

9

cheated out of a job by a  by an unlawful immigrant.

10

            MR. STEWART:  Well, again  again, leaving

11

aside the  the possibility that immigration is

12

something that can't be dealt with by private suits, if

13

there was some particularized connection required, if

14

the person could show that he applied for the job that

15

the illegal immigrant received, that  that would be a

16

much different sort of statute.

17

            Here the statute we're dealing with doesn't

18

say 

19

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  In the community  in 

20

in the border states is not proximate enough for you.

21

Let's just say anybody who is unemployed in the

22

community where there is an illegal immigrant can sue.

23

            MR. STEWART:  I think that's still probably

24

too  too broad a class.

25

            And I understand the allure of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

hypotheticals, but you could do the same thing with

2

rationalbasis review of substantive legislation.  You

3

could come up with endless hypotheticals about statutes

4

that were just at the border between really stupid and

5

so stupid as to be actually irrational.

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How  how  the

7

difference is that this is dealing with the requirement

8

of a case or controversy which has always been

9

recognized as at the core of Article III jurisdiction.

10

And we have a legion of cases that say you have to have

11

actual injury.

12

            That's what makes it a decision appropriate

13

for resolution by the judicial branch.  And it seems a

14

little bit more important than saying you can challenge

15

particular statutes.

16

            MR. STEWART:  Well, the point is  I was

17

trying to make was that Congress has been doing this

18

since 1790, and nobody's pointed to a statute that comes

19

close to the hypotheticals.

20

            But to  to return to the point about

21

injury in fact, the Court has said there has to be

22

actual injury.  But it has defined "injury" as the

23

invasion of a legal  legallyprotected interest, the

24

violation of a legal right.

25

            The most recent addition of Black's Law

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

Dictionary gives, as its first definition of "injury,"

2

"the violation of another's legal rights for which the

3

law provides a remedy."

4

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What  we've also said

5

that violation of a procedure, even if you are given a

6

right to the procedure, that alone does not suffice for

7

standing.  That is a procedure  that  that is a

8

procedure in vacuo that leads to nothing.

9

            MR. STEWART:  Well, what 

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  We  we said that, so it

11

has to be something more than just the violation of what

12

the  what Congress says is a legal right.  That 

13

that is not enough.

14

            MR. STEWART:  And at  the Court has also

15

said that Congress can't give every citizen an  an

16

entitlement to sue simply by calling it a legal right.

17

            But with respect to procedures, the Court

18

has said you can sue to complain about the deprivation

19

of lawfullyrequired procedures if those procedures are

20

intended to protect the 

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Right  right here we have

22

in the complaint, I guess, there were certain errors:  A

23

photograph of the wrong person; a statement that he's in

24

his 50s; he isn't.  That he's married; he isn't.  He's

25

employed in a professional or technical field; he isn't.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

That he has children; he doesn't.  That he has a

2

graduate degree; he doesn't.  That his economic health

3

is very strong; it isn't.  And his wealth level is in

4

the top 10 percent; it isn't.  Okay?

5

            So that, I gather, is what he is complaining

6

about.  Something like that.

7

            MR. STEWART:  Exactly.

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Fine.

9

            Now, for purposes of deciding this case, are

10

we simply to refer to this and say, this is a case about

11

a person who's complaining this?  And is this, which I

12

just listed, a sufficientlyconcrete injury?

13

            MR. STEWART:  Yes.  Absolutely.  And I 

14

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Thank you.

15

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Was it  then

16

that's not what the Ninth Circuit based its decision on.

17

The Ninth Circuit says he had standing by virtue of the

18

alleged violations of his statutory rights, without

19

respect to whether there was harm to his employment

20

process or related anxiety.

21

            So I would suppose, if we're going to decide

22

it on that basis, we have to determine that the Ninth

23

Circuit's rationale was in  was wrong.

24

            MR. STEWART:  I'm sorry I don't have the

25

exact wording in front of me, but if you look at the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

very first sentence of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the

2

Ninth Circuit says, "the question we confront is whether

3

a person has injury in fact when false information about

4

him is disseminated."

5

            Now, the  the Court said we don't have to

6

decide what is added to the complaint by the allegations

7

that employment prospects were actually harmed.

8

            And it's  and it's also true that the

9

Ninth Circuit didn't analyze the question that it framed

10

in quite the way we would have.

11

            It didn't rely on the defamation analogy; it

12

relied on the statutory right.  But it still described

13

the question before it as whether a person has injury to

14

complain about 

15

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And  and Mr. Stewart, if I

16

could just  I mean, the  maybe this is the sentence

17

that you're talking about.

18

            At one point the Court says, "the interests

19

protected by the statutory rights at issue are

20

sufficiently concrete and particularized."

21

            Now, look, it's not a good opinion, and then

22

it doesn't tell you why it is that they're sufficiently

23

concrete.  But they clearly held that they were

24

sufficiently concrete.  They understood that as part of

25

the test.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

            MR. STEWART:  The  the other point I would

2

make  I  I agree with that.

3

            And the other point I would make about

4

Defenders of Wildlife is the statute at issue in that

5

case said any person can sue to complain about

6

particular types of Endangered Species Act violations.

7

And the Court said, that's just too broad.  Congress

8

can't do that.

9

            But it didn't say, therefore, the

10

authorization to sue is a nullity, and we don't have to

11

worry about whether this plaintiff has standing to sue.

12

It analyzed in depth the allegations and the evidence

13

that the particular plaintiffs in Defenders of Wildlife

14

had put forward and said this is insufficient.

15

            And then later, in Bennett v. Spear, the

16

Court applied the same Endangered Species Act provision

17

at the behest of a plaintiff who did have standing.

18

            So it isn't the case that, if Congress fails

19

to draw exactly the right line, people who would have

20

been within the right line are out of luck.  I think the

21

allegations of the complaint are  are the important

22

thing to focus on.

23

            With  with respect to the defamation

24

analogy, I'd say Congress, in one sense, is broader than

25

common law, and in another sense it's narrower.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

61
1

            It's broader in that the statute certainly

2

sweeps in categories of types of falsehoods 

3

            May I finish?

4

             types of falsehoods that wouldn't have

5

been defamation per se at common law.

6

            On the other hand, it applies only to

7

Consumer Reports, documents that are intended to be used

8

for concrete, primarily economic purposes.

9

            Thank you.

10

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

        REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. ANDREW J. PINCUS

14

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

            MR. PINCUS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

            Justice Kagan asked the question earlier

17

about how could people find this?

18

            You know, our legal system is people have to

19

have allegations that they're harmed.  And I'd urge to

20

the Court to look at the public justice amicus brief on

21

the other side of the case for a whole series of claims

22

in which  that people filed and they were able to make

23

allegations of actual harm.

24

            The argument that the Ninth Circuit relied

25

on falsity is a fiction.  The first sentence, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

62
1

overture of its opinion, mentions that there is an

2

allegation of falsity.  There is not a word in its

3

standing analysis that refers at all to falsity.  It

4

relied on statutory violations, period, including the

5

violations that say nothing about falsity.

6

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So are we ruling on the

7

outcome or are we ruling on the reasoning?

8

            MR. PINCUS:  Well, Your Honor, I  I think,

9

as the Court comes  the  the question presented was

10

does the Ninth Circuit's rule that a mere statutory

11

violation unaccompanied by any harm is sufficient to

12

satisfy Article III?

13

            I think the Court has to address that issue.

14

            The next issue is:  Did Congress elevate 

15

did  did Congress say that false statements inflict a

16

certain kind of harm, and therefore, we're going to

17

single them out?

18

            And I think, to rely on Congress, Congress

19

actually has to have made that determination.  And there

20

is nothing in the statute that says that.

21

            As Justice Breyer said, you have to actually

22

read falsity into the statute in order to find falsity.

23

            Congress didn't say anything about the

24

particular harm inflicted by false statements.

25

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

63
1

            MR. PINCUS:  If it wanted to do that, it

2

should 

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  See, I look at this case

4

slightly differently.  I think the breach of any legal

5

right you're given is  gives Article III jurisdiction.

6

            There is a difference between that and

7

whether you're within the zone of interest of a statute.

8

And so what you're saying  I  I guess that's why the

9

circuits below have said you have to be able to allege

10

some falsity in the credit report to get recovery under

11

the statute because those are the people the statute was

12

targeted to.

13

            MR. PINCUS:  Your Honor, that's not right.

14

The  all of the decisions that my friends refer to

15

were decisions, not where there were willfulness claims,

16

but where there were actual damages claims.  No surprise

17

that the courts have said to prove actual damages you

18

have to at least show falsity.

19

            There has been no decision interpreting the

20

statute in the context of a willfulness claim to say

21

whether it does.

22

            And I think the problem with the position on

23

the other side is they want to say Congress made this

24

decision that anything inaccurate is  is harmful, but

25

there's nothing in the statute to say that.  Congress

should speak clearly if it wants to do that, and then

2

this Court has to review that determination.

3

            And I think the question would be, has

4

the  is the class defined by Congress sufficiently

5

congruent with tangible harm to  to satisfy Article

6

III?

7

            And I think 

8

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But here you 

9

            MR. PINCUS:   the class of all

10

inaccuracies can't possibly be a class of people, most

11

of whom are going to suffer one harm.

12

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  We have one brief, the

13

brief of the restitution scholars who say if this Court

14

says that you have to show  how can  some harm, what

15

happens to all the restitution cases where you measure

16

the relief by the gain to the defendant?  There has been

17

no loss to the plaintiff.

18

            MR. PINCUS:  Your Honor, restitution is all

19

about a measure of damages.  And all those cases 

20

often they're breach of contract cases  there's harm.

21

The property interest conferred by the contract has been

22

violated, and the question is a measure of damages.  In

23

the fiduciary duty context, as in the property 

24

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  So what is  what is the

25

harm to the neighbor whose  puts a toe into his

neighbor's land?

2

            MR. PINCUS:  It  it is the intrusion on

3

the right to exclude the property interest created by

4

the common law.  And this statute doesn't create a

5

property interest, so it can't be upheld on this basis.

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

7

            The case is submitted.

            (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the

aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
