CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in Case 06-571, Watson v. United

5

States.

6

Mr. Koch.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KARL J. KOCH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KOCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Mr. Watson's receipt of a firearm in

12

exchange for drugs does not constitute the use of that

13

firearm as the word "use" is employed by 18 U.S.C.

14

Section 924(c)(1) for two principal reasons.

15

applying the plain and ordinary meaning of the word

16

"use," the receipt of a thing is not the use of that

17

thing.

18

someone uses a firearm when all that person does is

19

receive it.

First,

There is no grammatically proper way to say that

20

Second, treating receipt as use under the

21

statute conflicts with this Court's decision in Bailey

22

v. United States, which held that use requires active

23

employment.

24
25

And I'll address those two points in turn.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would you address first

whether receipt of the gun constitutes possession of the
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

gun?

2

MR. KOCH:

Yes, ma'am.

I believe receipt

3

does constitute possession.

4

possession standing alone under this Court's decision in

5

Bailey does not constitute use.

6
7

However, of course,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But under the statute as

amended, possession is also indictable.

8

MR. KOCH:

Possession in furtherance of the

9

offense is -- is -- would be indictable.

That -- that

10

was not charged in this particular case.

And I would

11

suggest that the -- that the circumstances of this case

12

might not call that into -- into play simply because his

13

possession really was -- was incidental, and it was

14

following the conclusion of the drug transaction.

15

So I think -- I question whether the

16

possession in furtherance would necessarily apply here.

17

Of course, it was not charged.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm not sure.

19

I have the same question as Justice Ginsburg.

It seems

20

to me, absent some precedents which narrows this

21

definition, that that would have been the way to charge

22

your client.

23

the indictment; that's not what you're arguing.

24

guess the question is more appropriate for the

25

government.

That's not what was charged; that's not

4

Alderson Reporting Company

So I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But, if, following Justice Ginsburg's

2

question, this covers it, and it seems to me that it

3

does, then we're not arguing about very much.

4

MR. KOCH:

I understand, Your Honor.

My

5

only point, again, would be, that recognizing that "in

6

furtherance," at least by the authors of that language,

7

would suggest it to mean something more than "in

8

relation to,." I think the question could legitimately

9

be asked in a -- in a transaction like this, where the

10

possession basically is what he was attempting to

11

achieve and did, in fact, achieve, but after the -- at

12

the end transaction.

13

I don't -- I can't answer whether or not,

14

ultimately, that would be -- deemed to be in furtherance

15

or not.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Koch, let's say

17

that the parties to the transaction are concerned about

18

avoiding exposure under the money-laundering statute,

19

and so they got together and said:

20

going to have this deal.

21

And they say:

22

And the seller of the drugs says:

23

use that.

24
25

All right, we are

What can we use besides money?

Well, let's use guns, or let's use a gun.
Okay.

I'm willing to

Isn't he using the gun in furtherance of the
transaction?

MR. KOCH:

that that would constitute active employment still.

employed as the consideration in the sale.
MR. KOCH:

However, the -- from the

standpoint CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not being shot,

but it's still being employed.
MR. KOCH:

Yes, sir.

From the standpoint of

12

the -- of the seller -- from the standpoint of the drug

13

seller, who's ultimately still doing nothing more with

14

respect to the gun, I think the focus has to be on what

15

are his activities?

16

of it in the example that Your Honor has given.

17

He hasn't even come into possession

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I think it would

18

be a natural, grammatical construction to say he's

19

willing to use the gun for the consideration.

20

MR. KOCH:

Your Honor, I'm not certain that

21

we would -- that we -- that it could be held in the

22

absence even there of even possession -- whether or not

23

that would be enough to constitute the use.

24

be the first question that would occur to me.

That would
The -

1

the facts of this case, grammatically the question on

2

the table is:

3

924(c)(1) giving it, as this Court held in Smith, its

4

plain and ordinary meaning, the example that was used by

5

the D.C. Circuit in United States v. Stewart, I thought,

6

was appropriate, where -- the coffee shop example, where

7

you have the -- the individual buying the coffee, and

8

you have the cashier.

9

When interpreting 18 U.S.C. Section

The -- the customer doesn't -- the customer

10

comes in and pays with the dollar.

11

the dollar, but the cafeteria isn't using the dollar by

12

receiving it as payment.

13

Likewise, the customer isn't using the coffee through

14

the act of receiving it.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

The cashier accepts

It's just receiving it.

He's getting it.
Well, if we look at this

16

transaction, a guns-for-drugs transaction, is there -

17

can you think of any good reason why Congress would want

18

to prescribe a 5-year penalty for the person who hands

19

over the gun, but not any penalty for the person who

20

receives the gun and hands over the drugs?

21

MR. KOCH:

I do think that there are

22

distinctions between the two conducts, sir.

23

all, certainly the person that -- that has the gun and

24

is bringing it into that transaction I would suggest, as

25

a practical matter presents a different type of risk.

So that the -

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so that the -- the risk

6

is Congress was worried that somebody would go to a

7

transaction like this with a gun originally intending to

8

trade it for drugs and then when one person gets there,

9

a person decides to shoot somebody with the gun?

10

MR. KOCK:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

I think And that's why they would

penalize one side of this transaction and not the other?

13

MR. KOCH:

Well, assuming of course it would

14

-- in Smith the Court held that that is a use within the

15

term of the statute.

16

this does not do violence to this Court's decision in

17

Bailey.

18

The person on the drug end of the transaction is -

19

really has nothing to do with the gun, doesn't even

20

possess the gun, which -- before the other party decides

21

to hand it over.

22

I think that the -- looking at -

There still has to be some active employment.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In Smith, the Court said

23

that the reason that selling the gun in exchange for

24

drugs -- what was dangerous about that was the potential

25

for instantly converting the gun from currency to a
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

concern because one who receives the gun can instantly

3

turn it around and shoot the drug seller?

4

But here isn't that even all the more of

MR. KOCH:

He could if the gun was handed

5

over in a condition -- first of all, there -- were there

6

bullets or not?

7

instance, whether he brings them or not, the gun seller.

8

The gun seller can decide whether to hand it over -

But it's the same on both

13

It seems to me in both cases there is a risk of
The one who comes in with the gun can

MR. KOCH:

I will -- I will grant Your Honor

14

there's obviously risk presented by the presence of the

15

gun potentially by either party.

16

as between the two parties, the fellow that shows up

17

with the gun who's going to decide when and if to hand

18

it over and in what condition, cocked, uncocked, loaded

19

or unloaded, et cetera, is in somewhat more control.

20

I would suggest that,

All that being said, one still gets back to

21

the central point, which is, regardless of Congress's

22

purpose or desires here, they still chose words that had

23

fairly common meanings, in this case "use."

24

it's grammatically impossible, I'd suggest, in the

25

straightforward transaction and trade situation to
9

Alderson Reporting Company

And very -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suggest that the guy that's receiving the gun is using

2

it by receiving it, any more than the cashier is using

3

the dollar that I pay for the cup of coffee with.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the person who hands over

5

the gun is not a government agent or informant, is there

6

any doubt that the person who hands over the drugs can

7

be charged with using the -- the gun under 18 U.S.C.

8

Section 2(b)?

9

the gun, to do something that is a crime.

10

He causes -- the person who hands over

MR. KOCH:

I do think that there -- that's

11

an issue that's been raised.

12

when the underlying offense itself is the transaction

13

and these are the only two parties, whether or not

14

aiding and abetting liability would be intended to

15

extend that far, any more than it would be, for example,

16

to a drug purchaser being charged with aiding and

17

abetting the distribution of drugs.

18

I -- I question whether,

Certainly, given the severe penalties

19

involved, I -- I'm a little uncomfortable with that

20

being a usage of that statute or usage of the aiding and

21

abetting statute.

22

overwhelming majority of these cases do involve police

23

informants, practically all of them.

24
25

I also would point out that the

language of 924.

Well, you're relying on the

Now, the -- the government's brief concedes

it would not be natural to say that the customer in my

example with the coffee used the coffee.

5

prepared to discard that standard usage of words and

sacrifice it for the purpose that we believe Congress

intended, then I think that the analysis really does

stop there if one's reading the language of the statute

MR. KOCH:

I think that that raises that I see in different

contexts with this is the different ways that the word

"use" is used in an active or passive context.

2

example, did Mr. Watson use the firearm?

3

that that's -- that's the question that needs to be

4

asked and when that question is asked in that format,

5

then the answer I suggest is no.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I think

I don't remember whether

7

you ask in your brief as an alternative argument for the

8

overruling of Smith.

9
10

MR. KOCH:

I did not raise that in the

briefs, no, ma'am.

11

With regards to Bailey, which I think

12

answers to a great extent some of the questions

13

presented here, Bailey of course held that 924(c)(1)

14

requires evidence sufficient to show an active

15

employment of the firearm by the defendant.

16

here did not actively employ the firearm.

17

narrowed the category of uses that fell within the

18

statute.

19

active employment reading of use restricts the scope of

20

924(c)(1)."

21

that use requires active employment, not only in general

22

but by the defendant.

23

Mr. Watson
Bailey

To quote Bailey, it said "It's undeniable the

Bailey held

More importantly perhaps to this case,

Bailey held that possession alone is not use, and here

6

did was possess it for an instant, still not enough, I'd

suggest, to qualify as active employment or use under

8

Bailey, the most recent definition that we have

9

available.

10

So looking at it from a temporal
Before that

After that point, all he

There's an argument presented by the

11

government that feeds off of Smith's use of 924(d) which

12

I wanted to mention briefly.

13

the importation of the definition of the term "use" from

14

924(d), the forfeiture provision of the statute, into

15

924(c).

16

The -- and that is the -

In Smith, the Court held that there were

17

predicate offenses for 924(d) in which the only way that

18

the weapon could be used was in a non-weapon use, which

19

is what the Court was concerned about in the Smith case,

20

and therefore the Court found, looking at those

21

predicate offenses that had non-weapon uses only, that

22

therefore the term "use" as it's employed in 924(d) must

23

include non-weapon use.

24

that's the argument made by the government -- that

25

doesn't translate into the situation we have here.

That logic, however -- and

14
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

addressed, by the way, on page 9 of our reply brief in

2

some detail.

3

I'll talk about it briefly.

First of all, 924(d) is a forfeiture

4

provision and the focus there necessarily is on the

5

firearm, not on the defendant.

6

is, quote, "any firearm or ammunition intended to be

7

used in one of the predicate offenses."

8

with 924(c), which states "any person who during and in

9

relation to a drug trafficking crime uses or carries a

10

The language in 924(d)

That's compared

firearm."

11

So you have firearm intended to be used on

12

the one hand, versus a person who uses a firearm.

13

might say perhaps that in this transaction a firearm was

14

used, but not -- that's a different thing from saying

15

that Mr. Watson used the firearm.

16

active formulation.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It has to be used by

18

somebody, some human, and the human in this case is

19

Mr. Watson.

20

MR. KOCH:

Well, ma'am, I think under Smith

21

the human that's using the firearm in the transaction is

22

actually the person that came with the firearm to use it

23

to purchase drugs.

24

was definitely a use, it wasn't even really contested in

25

Smith.

And as -- as Smith said that that

And so I -- and I'm not contesting for this case

obviously that that person that showed up with the gun

2

is using the gun to get drugs.

3
4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

It wasn't

contested in Smith?
MR. KOCH:

I beg your pardon, Judge.

I

6

meant that the Court, in its holding -- I recognize that

7

it was contested.

8

it tended to focus more on the question of whether or

9

not a nonweapon use would -- would be required.

In its holding, the Court said that

But

10

the -- certainly as between the two parties in this

11

transaction, the guy that shows up with the gun trying

12

to use it to get drugs is certainly making use of it in

13

a way that, that recipient is not.

14

The -- in, in Smith, the Court reached the

15

opinion it did about the meaning of the term "use" only

16

because there were, there were predicate offenses in

17

which the only uses available were nonweapons uses.

18

contrast, here the predicate offenses that are suggested

19

to import this definition of "use," there aren't any

20

predicate offenses in which the only way to commit the

21

offense is through receipt.

22

By

I'll grant you that there are predicate

23

offenses in which receipt is one of the ways in which

24

the offense can be committed, but it's not the only way.

25

And so that logical step can't be made, as it arguably
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could have been in Smith.

2

And finally, unlike the situation in Smith,

3

here we know that the predicate offenses can't be

4

interpreted -

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Go back over

that.

7

MR. KOCH:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Excuse me.

Yes, sir.
Why couldn't it have been

said in Smith that -- that trading it for drugs was not

10

the only way in which the offense could have been

11

committed?

12

Smith?

13

Couldn't the same thing have been said in

MR. KOCH:

In Smith the argument, as I took

14

it from the opinion, Justice, was that the -- when one

15

looked at, at the predicates, there were several which

16

had, according to the opinion, only nonweapon uses.

17

if, if it's used or intended to be used in committing

18

one of those offenses and one looks at those offenses

19

and there's only nonweapon uses, then so the argument

20

goes, that means nonweapon uses are part of use.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the issue in Smith was

22

weapon versus nonweapon, and that's not what you're

23

arguing here?

24

MR. KOCH:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So

That's correct, sir.
The issue here is use

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

versus nonuse, active employment versus passive receipt?

2

MR. KOCH:

Yes, sir.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why isn't it -- why isn't

4

your argument more directly that the issue here is -- is

5

nonweapon use by A versus nonweapon use by B?

6

represent B and you say B wasn't the one who used it in

7

a nonweapon sense?

8
9
10

MR. KOCH:

I agree that certainly Mr. Watson

didn't use it in any weapons sense.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

that's the end of the case.
MR. KOCH:

And if you are right,

I understand, Your Honor.

14

understand what you're saying.

15

That is another way.

16

that we went, but that makes sense.

17

So if there is a

use at all, it would be in a nonweapon sense.

11

13

You

I

I believe you're right.

It's not -- it's not the direction

The -- what we focused on was use or not at

18

the first instance.

19

that case use and defining it broadly to include a

20

nonweapon use here, we're getting to the point where

21

there's no use at all in the first place.

22

And Smith having decided that in

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you're not -- as you

that he certainly, in a situation like that where he is,

he is not possessing the gun, he is expressing his

intentions or desires with respect to it.

in a position to do anything more than that.

Factually what happened was that

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the factual, particular

What do you have besides

5

the linguistic argument?

I mean, when I start out, I

6

can't think of a reason why Congress wouldn't want to

7

penalize the buyer, not the seller.

a statute that does catch your client, if they had only

9

charged him with the right part.

We are dealing with

But no one in his

right mind would ever rely on a ruling in your favor to

actually engage in such a transaction, since it would

12

violate the statute in 15 different ways.

13

but you see the point.

I exaggerate,

14

So you have a linguistic argument which

15

people are -- you're right, I think, in saying it's

awkward but not impossible.

17

not impossible; we create an anomaly in the law.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

if you said, look, both sides of the transaction should

be treated alike, but they should be both outside the

2

word "use."

3

MR. KOCH:

I do not believe it's necessary

4

for this Court to overrule Smith in order to rule for

5

the Petitioner here, because of -- because of the

6

differences, first of all linguistically; and secondly

7

because of the reliance on Bailey.

8

10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in answer to my

question, you said you were not urging the overruling of
Smith?
MR. KOCH:

That's correct.

That being said,

12

I think that there is, there are arguments that can be

13

presented, they were presented in Smith, as to whether

14

one could take one position or the other.

15

doesn't, it doesn't do violence to Smith to hold for the

16

Petitioner here.

17

But it

Ultimately, when you look at the Bailey

18

decision and at the facts of Bailey, and there you have

19

people riding around with guns in the trunk of their

20

car, and that's held not to be a use within the statute.

21

Well, here Watson didn't even do that.

22

never had the guns in the first place going into the

23

transaction.

24
25

He

So it seems to me if Bailey -

JUSTICE BREYER:
it could have been loaded.

But he receives the gun and
And if it was loaded, you

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

receive a loaded gun, and you're there and you give the

2

money for the gun and you have the gun and somebody

3

comes up, maybe you'll shoot him.

4

like a risk.

5

MR. KOCH:

I mean, that seems

Under Bailey, however, if all he

6

did was receive the gun, hold it in his hand, Bailey

7

says that's not enough, that's not a use.

8

course, those are the facts of this case.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And, of

Suppose he received the

10

gun, loaded it and said, well, now, let's renegotiate

11

this transaction?

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. KOCH:

very clearly, if he then takes the gun and uses it to

communicate a threat to the other party, then he is

Could the

Your Honor, I believe if the jury

23

was to find in that factual scenario that that was -

24

that he was, in fact, silently making reference to the

25

gun, then I think that gets you within Bailey.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

There's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

all kinds of things Mr. Watson could do beyond what the

2

facts of this case are that would turn it, what he did,

3

into active employment and use.

4

and putting it -- and holding it, which are the facts in

5

this record, doesn't -- doesn't rise to the level of use

6

under Bailey.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But merely getting it

I thought Bailey involved a

8

guy, he had the gun in a locked thing in the trunk of

9

his car, which is a little different from holding it in

10
11

your hand.
MR. KOCH:

There were -- there were actually

12

two, two different fact patterns in the consolidated.

13

One had a gun that was locked up in another room, the

14

other one had guns in the trunk, with expert testimony

15

being that that was the typical method of drug dealers

16

to protect their drugs and things.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If he has a gun in his

hand he is certainly carrying it.

19

MR. KOCH:

He did have the gun in his hand

20

then he would be carrying it under Muscarello and the

other cases.

22

That's correct.

Yes, ma'am.

Recognizing again I just would point out

that whatever condition Mr. Watson had the gun in and -

it during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.

16

Although the situation in Smith was different, the

17

principle of Smith is that use of a firearm as an item

of trade or commerce -- specifically used as the medium

19

of exchange -- is a use falling within the meaning of

20

Section 924(C).

21

In doing so Petitioner used

But that does not answer

the question use by whom.

that we normally use the word.

make that argument is to define the crime as consisting

of the agreement as opposed to the consummated

No.

the crime is the taking of the firearm in exchange for

minute ago that he was using it because he agreed to

accept it.

MS. MAYNARD:

I think one could make the

argument, Justice Souter, that an agreement alone is a

24

use once, one agrees to use the gun as the medium of

25

exchange to sell one's drugs.

The Government is not

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pressing that point here today and we don't, and the

2

Court need not go that far because here Petitioner did

3

receive the drugs, and the reason that possibly the

4

agreement line goes too far is the rationale of this

5

Court's decision in Smith where the Court pointed out

6

that someone who makes a material misstatement in order

7

to acquire a gun is clearly not using the gun, but the

8

Court gave examples of receipt offenses in, in the

9

forfeiture provisions in Section 924(D) where receipt of

10

a firearm is a use under the statute.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why wouldn't making

12

a material misstatement in order to obtain a gun

13

constitute a use of the gun -- as much as it, the

14

receipt of the gun constitutes a use of the gun here?

15

What's the difference between the two situations?

I think one could make the

argument, Your Honor, as I said, that making material

statement.

the dangers present with which Congress was concerned,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

made the very persuasive argument that it doesn't make

5

sense to treat both sides of the transaction exactly the

6

same; but isn't it the fact that in many drug

7

transactions the buyer is not treated the same way as

8

the seller?

may not be a crime to buy the poison drugs.

It's a crime to sell poison drugs but it

correct, Your Honor; but in those cases where Congress

transaction.

2

of receipt crimes that Smith believed was a use,

3

including unlicensed receipt of a firearm from out of

4

State, receipt of a stolen firearm and receipt of a

firearm with an intent to commit a felony; and in

context Congress clearly did use "use" broadly in

broadens that enormously, doesn't it?

MS. MAYNARD:

5

that actually strengthens my point.

6

Yes it does, Your Honor; but

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It cuts the other

7

way.

8

to reach that broadly, and it didn't do it under the

9

provision in which -- pursuant to which Mr. Watson was

10
11

Congress knows how to say involved in if it wants

indicted.
MS. MAYNARD:

Well yes, Your Honor, but if

12

you allow me to continue on, further on in (D)(1)

13

Congress used a narrow subset of crimes some of which

14

include receipt crimes where it only used the word use

15

and that's the logic to this Court's decision in Smith

16

and it applies equally here.

17

Congress allowed the Government to forfeit firearms

18

intended to be used in certain very specific listed

19

crimes, and in other words to forfeit the firearms

20

before the -- the crime actually is committed.

21

those crimes include -- receipt crimes -- include the

22

very receipt crimes listed by this Court in Smith' and

23

so given that Congress believed that the firearms

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if Congress

passes a statute saying anyone who uses a gun in a crime

of violence gets an additional sentence, the person who

22

is shot is using the gun in a crime of violence?

MS. MAYNARD:

You wouldn't have to go that

far here, Your Honor, because the "use" here is use as a

May I ask It held that the

person who does use the gun, which is the natural,

grammatical construction, uses the firearm.

quite a bit different than the question of whether

someone who receives it as the consideration is using

the firearm.

14

MS. MAYNARD:

That's

I think the rationale

15

necessary to the holding in Smith, Your Honor, was that

16

use of a gun as an item of trade or commerce,

17

specifically as the medium of exchange, is the "use."

18

And, in fact, Smith refers several times to an earlier

19

D.C. Circuit decision in Harris, a per curiam, a public

20

per curiam, in which two members of this Court were on

the panel, that involved this very fact pattern, where

But you don't have a countervailing sentence

MS. MAYNARD:

I think in -- in Bailey, Your

7

Honor, the Court required a use that makes the gun an

8

operative factor, a use that changes the circumstances

where both parties are aware the gun is being used.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what was your

point referring to the people who were convicted under

MS. MAYNARD:

That it -- that it is of

ongoing importance to the government, even though as a

It was only to make the point that the

government does have an interest in how the Court rules

in this case and that it's not meaningless to us which

12

prong applies here.

13

Back to the 922(d)(4) point, the -- under

14

Petitioner's reading, it would mean that the government

15

can't forfeit firearms in a situation like someone under

felony indictment ships or transports -- intends to ship

17

or transform a firearm.

18

Government can forfeit that because they consider that

to be active verbs, but under -- if the person under

felony indictment simply intends to receive a firearm,

21

the government would have to wait until that person

22

receives the firearm in order to be able to forfeit it,

If he has constructive

possession of it, Justice Stevens, and he's -- I believe

he would have received it and that would be sufficient.

the transaction is desired and certainly something has

to go, I would suggest it ought to be Smith because

3

otherwise you're stuck with Bailey and with what I

4

suggest are settled principles of statutory

5

construction.

6

about as far as it could go, and you're having to make

7

-- you have to make a number of linguistic compromises

8

to get to the Smith result to begin with.

9

The --

13

drug transaction rather than in furtherance of a drug

14

transaction.

15

I do think, and it's obvious from other

16

statutes in the neighborhood, that Congress certainly

17

knows how to say "receive" and "accept" and words of

18

that nature, if it was its intent to -- to make the

19

receipt of a weapon or bring that within the ambit of

20

this -- of this particular statute.

I don't think it's enough to say, as my

really stretches this farther than it should go.
Lastly, I would point out, and again this is

3

in our brief around page 9, with respect to this 924(d)

4

argument, one of the predicate offenses that's used in

5

924(d) is 922(j), which includes language "it shall be

6

unlawful for any person to receive, possess, conceal,

7

store, barter, sell, or dispose of" et cetera.

8

"possess" is there in 922(j), yet we know from Bailey

9

that "possess" in and of itself can't be a use.

Well,

And

10

that's just one of the reasons why that argument

11

unfortunately falls apart when one is trying to import

12

those definitions of use into this statute.

I have nothing further.
