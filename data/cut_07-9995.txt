CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument next in Case 07-9995, Rivera v. Illinois.

5

Mr. Leven.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES K. LEVEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. LEVEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Petitioner lawfully exercised a

11

peremptory challenge on juror Delores Gomez.

12

result of the erroneous denial of that challenge, Ms.

13

Gomez wrongfully sat on the jury and lacked authority to

14

render a judgment.

15

reversed automatically for three separate and

16

independent reasons.

17

As a

Petitioner's conviction should be

First, the trial before an unlawful

18

adjudicator is structural error.

19

seating of a juror is structural error, because the

20

effect of the error is impossible to determine -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Two, the wrongful

Are you putting -- are

22

you equating this with a biased judge?

The -- the

23

category of structural error has been kept very narrow

24

by this Court.

25

perfectly qualified, who it is conceded -- it is

And it seems to me that a juror who is

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

conceded could not have been dismissed for cause, is

2

quite a different matter than a judge who -- who has

3

taken a bribe or who has a monetary stake in the case.

4

It -- it seems quite a stretch to apply

5

those decisions to -- to the case of a juror who was

6

qualified, and it was just a judge who was overexuberant

7

in denying a peremptory challenge.

8

MR. LEVEN:

Well, our unlawful-adjudicator

9

claim is not dependent on a finding or showing of bias.

10

A -- a juror who is illegally on the jury, who does not

11

have the authority to serve, would render the jury

12

improperly constituted.

13

structural error for a jury illegally constituted to

14

render a judgment irrespective of bias.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Therefore, there would be

Okay.

But your whole

16

argument that the -- that the juror was illegally

17

sitting and the jury was illegally constituted is a -

18

in effect a statement of the effect of State law.

19

the State supreme court doesn't think that's the effect

20

under State law.

21

And

So it seems to me that the -- the full

22

premise of your argument that there is something

23

inherently unlawful about the seating of that juror is

24

simply in -- in effect denied by the State supreme

25

court.

And we take our law from them.

MR. LEVEN:

Well, Your Honor, there are

2

State law and Federal law components to this issue.

3

Petitioner had a lawful right to excuse juror Gomez

4

under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 434.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But no -- no

6

constitutional right, no constitutional right to the

7

peremptory challenge.

8
9

MR. LEVEN:

Well, there is a constitutional

right to due process involved that is -

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you -- you in effect

11

are saying that any violation of State law with respect,

12

let's say, to criminal trial procedure becomes, if not

13

remedied, a due process violation under Federal law.

14

That's -- that's your -- your unstated premise, isn't

15

it?

16

MR. LEVEN:

17

argument is very narrow in scope:

18

that is illegally constituted renders a verdict of

19

guilty, then that jury is an unlawful adjudicator.

20

unlawful adjudicator claim is what triggers the right to

21

due process.

22

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- our

That if a -- a jury

The

There could be a thousand

23

reasons why under State law a particular jury is

24

improperly constituted.

25

State under whatever State laws it has says that the

So you are saying whenever the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judge made a mistake about who to put on the jury, that

2

that violates the Federal Constitution.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just as an example, to

4

follow up on Justice Breyer's question -- and then can

5

you answer his question -- many States have -- have

6

rules that you have to be a resident of the county to

7

serve on that jury.

8

or she is a resident and gets the county line wrong or

9

doesn't know what the residency requirement.

And suppose a juror thinks that he

Under your

10

rule -- what is your term, an "unlawful adjudicator."

11

And then we have a -- we have a -- a Federal

12

constitutional standard that requires structural error

13

for any State -- for any violation of any State -- State

14

rule.

15

That is Justice Breyer's question.
MR. LEVEN:

Well, with respect to jury

16

qualifications such as age and citizenship, there is a

17

very delicate screening process that goes into effect.

18

So the problem of an unlawful-adjudicator with respect

19

to, say, age would be a very, very rare phenomenon and

20

would rarely occur, because jurors who are too young to

21

serve, perhaps under 18 years old, would never make

22

their way to a jury pool in the first place.

23

would really be unfair to -

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it

You are -- you are

avoiding the question by saying, oh, don't worry, there
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are not going to be many violations of this sort, and

2

then you pick out age.

3

preface to his question was -- was that there are -- are

4

manifold requirements varying from State to State.

But Justice Breyer began -- the

5

MR. LEVEN:

Well, I think -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What you are giving us is

7

a sweeping proposition, A, for the constitutional

8

principles that you are setting forth; B, for the

9

supervision and intrusion it would cause Federal courts

10

on the State system.

11

MR. LEVEN:

Well, if we take the juror's

12

qualifications that were discussed in the State's brief,

13

it would appear that all the qualifications that are

14

discussed there would -- as I said, it would be a very

15

rare situation, indeed, for a -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why?

One

17

qualification is that a jury -- a juror can't be

18

prejudiced.

19

thing for prosecutors and defense lawyers to get into

20

arguments about whether a particular juror is or is not

21

prejudiced.

22

All right.

I think it's a very common

Okay.
So sometimes the judge excuses them, maybe

23

five million times a year; and probably in a certain

24

percentage, maybe 5,000 or 500 or 50,000, the judge is

25

wrong.

All right.

So the State appellate court says he's

So the jury wasn't made up properly.

8
9

It may be there is some

I don't know.

MR. LEVEN:

I have

That's why I am

Well, Gomez versus United States

set forth the principle equating a right to an

10

adjudicator with lawful authority to decide at every

11

critical stage of the proceeding.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that means that held -

13

we have held in that case -- I had better look at it -

14

that in any instance where excusing a juror violates

15

State law that that is a violation of the Federal

16

Constitution.

17

Which is the case that says that?

MR. LEVEN:

Well, that -- that case did not

18

involve jurors, Your Honor, but it did involve a

19

magistrate who lacked the authority to preside over voir

20

dire.

21

law equating the right of -- the lawful-authority right

22

to the right to an impartial jury and used the phrase "a

23

basic fair trial right," meaning that the right to a

24

lawful adjudicator is a basic fair trial right.

5

she was biased, you had a basis for that, she could be

6

excused for cause.

MR. LEVEN:

If

Well, there is a reasonable

8

possibility of bias with respect to Gomez because of her

extensive contacts with gunshot victims at Cook County

She wasn't a nurse.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. LEVEN:

Well, the purpose of the

2

peremptory challenge is to help to create a fair and

3

impartial jury.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly.

And for some

5

reason, I just think this person is not going to vote

6

for me.

7

don't want this person sitting on the jury.

8

the reason you need.

9

I don't know why.

MR. LEVEN:

I just don't think so.

That's right.

I

That's all

Under Swain v.

10

Alabama, a peremptory challenge can be exercised without

11

having to state a reason.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, our footnote in a

13

later case authored by Justice Scalia indicates

14

considerable doubt as to the viability and to the

15

correctness of that formulation in Swain.

16

MR. LEVEN:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

Well, with Salazar, I think, is

the -

19

MR. LEVEN:

Yes, Martinez-Salazar in its

20

footnote 4 determined that the automatic reversal rule

21

in Swain was subject to reconsideration due to the

22

advent of harmless error analysis.

23

But I was citing Swain for a different

24

purpose.

I was citing Swain for the purpose that a

25

peremptory challenge can be exercised without having to
10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

state a reason, and that's a fundamental -

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No. No.

I thought you

3

were citing Swain -- and I think you are going to have

4

to establish -- that peremptory -- to win your case,

5

that there is a constitutional basis, a constitutional

6

right to exercise a peremptory challenge, at least -

7

then you can you have a subset of that -- when the State

8

gives it to you.

9

that proposition.

10

But I think Swain no longer stands for

MR. LEVEN:

I wasn't citing it for that

11

proposition, Your Honor.

12

Lucey, for example, where the Court was analyzing the

13

right to an appeal.

14

to an appeal was not of constitutional origin, but once

15

the State had created a right to an appeal it had the

16

obligation to administer that right consistently with

17

fundamental fairness and due process.

18

We have the case of Evitts v.

And the Court found that the right

So here we have a peremptory right that the

19

State of Illinois wasn't obligated to create.

20

it adopted that peremptory right, it was, in effect,

21

adopting the long venerable tradition of peremptory

22

challenges that has existed in this country since the

23

founding.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But once

But the -- well, first,

how many peremptories does Illinois law allow?

MR. LEVEN:

For non-capital cases, it's

seven, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

allowed only three peremptory challenges.

5

be nothing in the least unconstitutional about that,

6

right?

7

MR. LEVEN:

Well, suppose a State
There would

Well, under Ross v. Oklahoma,

8

the State had the authority to regulate peremptory

9

challenges.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
it?

12

MR. LEVEN:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

This was number four, was

I'm sorry?
The challenge to Gomez

was the number four peremptory?

15

MR. LEVEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so, if the State had

17

only three which it could do, there would be no basis

18

for removing Gomez from the array.

19

would have already exercised three peremptory

20

challenges, she's number four, too bad.

the end of it, right?

22

MR. LEVEN:

That is, the defense

That would be

Well, as to our unlawful

adjudicator claim that would be correct, because if the

defense did not have a peremptory challenge to exercise

out -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is something

3

unseemly about saying because the State is generous in

4

its peremptories, you have a grand constitutional

5

argument to make, even though there is no constitutional

6

right to any peremptory challenge?

7

MR. LEVEN:

Well, the State is obligated,

8

consistent with due process, to provide that which is

9

promised.

10

And the problem JUSTICE SOUTER:

That goes back to the point

11

which you rejected when I suggested -- I suggested

12

earlier that you were in effect arguing that every

13

violation of a State statute in this criminal context

14

amounted to a due process violation.

15

that's not what I am arguing.

16

is exactly what you just said to Justice Ginsburg.

17

MR. LEVEN:

And you say, no,

It seems to me that that

Well, what makes the peremptory

18

challenge unique is its venerable tradition since the

19

time -

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, we were talking about

21

peremptory challenges before and we are talking about

22

peremptory challenges now.

23

position from -- from the position you stated in answer

24

to my question?

25

MR. LEVEN:

Have you changed your

Well, if I understand correctly,
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Your Honor, the case involves peremptory challenges.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Look, the question that I

3

thought I was asking and I thought you were answering

4

was this:

5

law in the -- we'll say in the selection of jurors -- is

6

automatically, if not remedied by the State, a Federal

7

due process violation?

8

correctly, no.

9

Do you claim that every violation of State

And you said, if I recall

It seemed to me that in answering

10

Justice Ginsburg's question just now you were saying

11

yes.

12

due process.

You said the State has to act consistently with

13

MR. LEVEN:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- so, do you stand by

15

the answer you gave me or is it, in fact, now your

16

position that every violation of state law that goes

17

unremedied becomes a federal due process violation?

18
19

MR. LEVEN:

No, I'm not saying that every

violation of State law that's unremedied -

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Then why does

21

this one become a due process violation if it's

22

unremedied.

23

MR. LEVEN:

Because this one involves a

24

State violation that resulted in an unlawful

25

adjudicator.

Let's take 14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but that -- that then

2

goes back to an earlier question.

It's an unlawful

3

adjudicator if state law says so.

Federal law says you

4

don't even have to have peremptory challenges, you don't

5

even have to have a process for winnowing out the Gomez

6

jurors.

7

So, in effect, if you are saying that there

8

is something unlawful about the seating of the juror,

9

you are making a statement of State law, and the State

10

Supreme Court disagrees with you, which seems to me to

11

foreclose your argument.

12

MR. LEVEN:

Well, the State disagreed with

13

our position as to the Federal automatic reversal law.

14

The court applied, and we would argue misapplied -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the court -- the

16

Supreme Court of Illinois did not find anything unlawful

17

about the juror sitting.

18

should have -- the peremptory challenge should have been

19

respected.

20

they clearly rejected the notion, that there was

21

something unlawful about the jury and unlawful about

22

that juror's participating in reaching a verdict; isn't

23

that correct?

24
25

They said, yeah, the perempt

But they did not say, and it seems to me

MR. LEVEN:

I would read the Illinois

Supreme Court opinion -- specifically what they did
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

state is that the trial court was incorrect in denying

2

the peremptory challenge, therefore that juror should

3

not have sat on the jury, that juror was wrongfully on

4

the jury.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, no.

The -- the

6

peremptory challenge should have been respected.

But

7

the Illinois Supreme Court did not say, as I understand

8

it, that by allowing the juror to sit the juror was

9

acting in an unlawful capacity, or that there was

10

something unlawful under State law about the jury's

11

actions and the jury's verdict.

12

Am I not correct about that?

13

MR. LEVEN:

Well, the Illinois Supreme Court

14

only made one statement, that the peremptory was

15

wrongfully denied.

16

reasoning -

17

Now, as far as elaborating on its

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if they thought that

18

tainted everything that happened afterwards, it seems to

19

me they would have said, therefore, the verdict is no

20

good.

21

MR. LEVEN:

No, because the court misapplied

22

this Court's precedent in Neder.

23

the court affirming the conviction.

24

do with the issue of whether or not -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's the basis for
It had nothing to

Yes, but it had everything

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to do, it seems to me, with the issue of State law.

2

Regardless of whether they applied or misapplied a

3

precedent of ours respect -- with respect to Federal

4

constitutional law, it seems to me that the Illinois

5

Supreme Court has to have meant it was okay so far as

6

the validity of the verdict was concerned for this

7

person to participate.

8

MR. LEVEN:

The Illinois Supreme Court found

9

that the verdict was valid because they thought that the

10

error was subject to harmless error review in relying on

11

Neder and Martinez-Salazar

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So ultimately, there was -

13

there was no error under State law that needed to be

14

corrected?

15

MR. LEVEN:

Well, there is an error in terms

16

of the adjudicator, Ms. Gomez, being seated on the jury

17

and under Rule 434 Petitioner had the right to a juror

18

that then was not subject to a peremptory challenge.

19

Gomez was -- seated on that jury.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But so far as the ultimate

21

jury verdict was concerned, the Illinois Supreme Court,

22

I understand it to have said, was there is no error that

23

needs to be corrected under State law.

24
25

MR. LEVEN:
way.

I don't read the opinion that

I read 17
Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then why didn't they

correct it?

3

MR. LEVEN:

Because they thought that the

4

error was subject to harmless error review under Federal

5

law.

6

And we would argue the two positions.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

You read -- in other words,

7

you read the -- the -- the Illinois Supreme Court as to

8

say, this is a violation of our statutes and

9

constitution, a violation that would -- would entitle

10

this person to have the -- the verdict set aside and a

11

new trial, but because the Federal practice, applying

12

Federal constitutional law, is to engage in harmless

13

error analysis, we won't correct our State law error as

14

a matter of State law, and -- and we will in fact apply

15

a harmless error analysis that otherwise wouldn't apply

16

because it's Federal, and on that ground we will let the

17

verdict stand.

18

Supreme Court?

19

Is that the way you read the Illinois

MR. LEVEN:

No.

The court declined to

20

determine whether a constitutional right had been

21

violated, but the court applied this Court's precedent

22

under Martinez-Salazar and Neder, the Federal harmless

23

error automatically reversal law that this Court has,

24

and used that to find that the error was subject to

25

harmless error review.

The court did not 18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but how -- how

could it do that if there were not some underlying

Federal constitutional right?

that."

5

would be the principle basis for that analysis?

6

would be the analytic framework that would lead it to

7

look to the Federal decisions?

8
9
10

I say "how could it do

It obvious that they did it; but what -- what

MR. LEVEN:

What

This is a State issue.

Well, the court did not specify

why it did so, but it did rely on Neder and
Martinez-Salazar.

11

And therefore -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we are asking you what

12

the analytic justification for that course of reasoning

13

is if that is indeed its course of reasoning.

14

MR. LEVEN:

Well, it's hard for me to

15

speculate on the thinking of the Illinois Supreme Court.

16

But -

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but you have to give

18

us a sustainable analytic framework if -- if we are

19

going to reverse their decision.

20

MR. LEVEN:

Well, we argued at the Illinois

21

Supreme Court level that due process was violated; but

22

the Illinois Supreme Court declined to consider whether

23

a constitutional right had been violated, moved

24

accordingly to the question of whether or not automatic

25

reversal would apply or whether the error would be
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

subject to harmless error review.

2

But the Illinois Supreme Court did not say

3

anything about whether a constitutional right had been

4

violated except it declined to consider that issue, even

5

though it was argued at that level by Petitioner.

6

Not only do we have a constitutional basis

7

for this Court to have access to its automatic reversal

8

law; the fact that the court did rely on -- the Illinois

9

Supreme Court relied on Neder and Martinez-Salazar gives

10

this Court authority to reach the issue of whether or

11

not to apply automatic reversal law under -- under its

12

authority to correct -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, the Illinois

14

Supreme Court was assuming a Federal violation when it

15

decided what the reversal rule would be.

16

Federal violation determines -- is bottomed on the

17

notion that there was an unlawful adjudicator on the

18

jury.

19

the earlier questions, if you have a Cook County jury

20

and they had a juror from Dupage County and the law says

21

no, you have got to have a local juror, and it turns out

22

that they had wrongly seated such a juror?

23

be an unlawful adjudicator?

24
25

But your

Would that reasoning apply, in regard to one of

would definitely be Federal constitutional error?

7
8

And if it is such an unlawful adjudicator, it

MR. LEVEN:

Yes, because it would implicate

the due process clause -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But would it have to

10

be -- would it have to be structural error?

11

don't know why you don't argue that it's structural

12

error when the error is a wrongful denial of a

13

peremptory challenge, because it is impossible for you

14

to establish the harmfulness of error because, as

15

Justice Scalia pointed out, a peremptory challenge is

16

just a hunch on your part; you don't need any more.

17

if it's something like he was in Dupage County rather

18

than Cook County, maybe that's something where it's fair

19

to put the burden of showing harmfulness on the

20

defendant.

21

MR. LEVEN:

I -- I

But

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

22

State under Chapman would be required to prove

23

harmlessness, and I think it would be impossible to

24

determine whether this -- this error would be harmful -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, maybe that's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

true.

2

peremptory challenge, but it doesn't seem to me to be

3

terribly difficult to say, well, he lives in Dupage

4

County and not Cook County, so what's the big deal?

5

My point is that may be true with respect to a

MR. LEVEN:

Well, under harmless error

6

review, the appellate court envisions the actual jury

7

that rendered the verdict, whether or not the error

8

would have rendered the verdict different had it been -

9

had it not occurred.

And in this instance, we have a -

10

we can't analyze it from the perspective of whether this

11

jury would have rendered the same verdict absent the

12

error, because this jury that rendered the verdict is

13

illegally composed, is illegitimate.

14

So what the Illinois Supreme Court did in

15

analyzing harmless error review is it substituted its

16

judgment for -- for the reviewing court, it substituted

17

its judgment for the -- for the jury.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -

But we had an actual

19

jury.

It's not as though you had no jury verdict and

20

then the court would say -- the court would say, we

21

think that this defendant was as guilty as they come;

22

but you had a jury with jurors who met all the State law

23

qualifications, already made the determination of guilt.

24

So that's a little different from the case where, say, a

25

judge would attempt the equivalent of a directed
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

verdict.
MR. LEVEN:

Well, in this case I don't think

3

we can look at it from the perspective that the Court

4

normally looks at it from when it reviews -- adopts

5

harmless error review.

6

Court looks at whether or not the error contributed to

7

the verdict and whether or not the actual jury that

8

rendered the verdict would have rendered the same

9

verdict absent the error.

In the normal situation the

10

But we don't have -- we can't do it from the

11

perspective of the actual jury in this case, because the

12

actual jury here is illegal.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think the

14

Constitution prohibits the State from going further than

15

Batson to protect against the use of peremptory

16

challenges for discriminatory purposes?

17

is there any reason why a State could not provide that

18

whenever -- that a trial judge always has the authority,

19

when the judge has any suspicion of discrimination, to

20

ask for an explanation from counsel as to the reason,

21

without having to establish -- without there having to

22

be a prima facie case?

23

MR. LEVEN:

Specifically,

Well, that's our position, Your

24

Honor, because what the trial judge did in this case is

25

asked for a reason without having established any prima
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

facie case.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, well, that's what

3

Batson says has to be done to in order justify the

4

strike.

5

couldn't go further to guard against discrimination in

6

the use of peremptories?

7

When -- but is there any reason why a State

MR. LEVEN:

I apologize, Your Honor; I'm not

8

sure I understand about going further than.

Under

9

Batson there is a three-step process, and the State must

10

establish a prima facie case of discrimination before

11

the judge is entitled to ask for any kind of

12

explanation; and here there wasn't any kind of gender

13

discrimination of any kind, according to the Illinois

14

Supreme Court.

15

was not authorized to even ask for an explanation.

16

the explanation given by defense counsel is pretty good.

17

Therefore, the -- the judge in this case

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But

But Justice Alito's

18

question is could the State say as a matter of State law

19

whenever the trial judge has a hunch that there might

20

have been discriminatory purpose involved, may he refuse

21

to allow the preemptory challenge?

22

MR. LEVEN:

23
24
25

Well, we argued that the judge

doesn't have sua sponte authority to JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but I -- if the State

explicitly gave the trial judge that authority, would
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that be constitutional?

2

MR. LEVEN:

Well, the -- the State has the

3

authority to have some regulation of preemptory

4

challenge rights.

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

preemptory challenge rights entirely?

7

MR. LEVEN:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Right?

Yes.
So this is not a hard

question.

10
11

The authority to challenge

MR. LEVEN:

Yes, the State can abolish

peremptory challenges if it wishes.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And, therefore, it could

13

take the much lesser step of allowing the trial judge,

14

if he has any suspicion that a peremptory-challenge

15

right is being used in violation of Batson, to disallow

16

it.

What is wrong with that.

17

MR. LEVEN:

In this case, though, we do have

18

peremptory challenges created by the State.

19

Honor, I request that I -- to reserve the remainder of

20

my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. SCODRO

25

MR. SCODRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There is no due-process violation here, and
that takes care of this case at the threshold.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, does it really?

5

Suppose I agree with you that there is -- there is no

6

Federal constitutional violation.

7

in assessing the consequence of a State-law violation

8

the Illinois court here was looking to Federal law and

9

was trying to apply the Federal law of harmless error.

10

If that's the situation, would we not have

But I also think that

11

the obligation to determine, or wouldn't we have the

12

obligation to determine, whether it was properly

13

applying the Federal law of harmless error?

14

it didn't have to, it chose to use the Federal law of

15

harmless error to -- to apply to this State violation.

16

MR. SCODRO:

Even though

Justice Scalia, the briefs

17

before the Illinois Supreme Court raise two independent

18

grounds for automatic reversal by the petitioner.

19

was a pure State law for automatic reversal.

20

was a due-process violation that would then trigger a

21

Federal automatic reversal.

22

One

The other

What the Illinois Supreme Court did

23

explicitly is to say, even if there were a due-process

24

violation here, we believe as a matter of Federal law

25

that would not trigger automatic reversal.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

What certainly applied -- because of some of

2

the Federal questions that they have suggested, what is

3

implied is that if the Court had believed that as a

4

matter of Illinois law there were an automatic-reversal

5

rule required, that this was an unlawful juror to the

6

extended so profound that it voided the judgment and

7

required a new trial, under those circumstances the

8

court would never have had to reach that assumption,

9

much less go into any of the analysis it did.

10

So here the court was faced with both

11

claims, rejected both, but to reach the Federal claim

12

they must first show a due-process violation.

13

that's what they failed to do here.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

Justice Scalia's question is what?

16

MR. SCODRO:

And

So your answer to

The answer, Your Honor, is that

17

if the court had said, we are going to lockstep our

18

Federal -- or, rather, our State harmless-error analysis

19

with the Federal question, Federal analysis, and

20

whatever they say goes, then I would agree under those

21

circumstances this Court could review that and say, you

22

got that wrong.

if the court -- if the -- if the Illinois court wanted

20

to back away from Federal law at this point, they could

21

absolutely do so.

22

say, you got it wrong federally, they could, of course,

23

at that point say, no, we -- as a matter of State law,

24

we are going to apply a Brack standard or a Chapman

25

doing it, so the jury is not properly as the defense

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Going back to

20

Justice Scalia's question, do you think we would have

21

jurisdiction of this certiorari condition if we were

22

convinced there was no Federal or constitutional error;

23

they were merely trying to decide whether the State

24

court applied the correct constitutional standard in

25

correcting what it thought was a correct federal
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constitutional error?

2

MR. SCODRO:

I don't, Your Honor.

I think

3

the Federal question, if there is one presented, is

4

whether or not there is a Federal due-process violation.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if there is none

6

there, we don't have jurisdiction to answer and give an

7

advisory opinion on how the Illinois Supreme Court

8

should run its shop.

9

MR. SCODRO:

10

That is correct.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the Illinois Supreme

11

Court can happily go along blaming everything on us, so

12

when it stands for reelection, it can say, well, we are

13

just applying Federal law.

14

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, I think in this

15

case what the Illinois Supreme Court did is they

16

concluded -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I know, but that's the

18

consequence of your answer to that question.

19

to me there is much to be said for the disposition that

20

where a State court even in resolving a State-law

21

question uses a Federal principle, adverts specifically

22

to Federal law and cites Federal cases, it would cover

23

you.

24
25

MR. SCODRO:

It seems

Your Honor, let me be clear.

What they did here is they had assumed the Federal
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constitutional violation because they recognized that

2

there was no State entitlement to a new trial under

3

these circumstances.

4

So they then said, well -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You -- they did make that

5

assumption, but you think the assumption is wrong.

6

if we think the assumption is wrong, you would agree

7

with Justice Scalia that we can go ahead and say, well,

8

you are running for reelection, so we are going to

9

correct your errors on Federal law.

10

MR. SCODRO:

And

I would say, Your Honor, I

11

think that if the Court were to conclude there is no

12

due-process violation, it would be an artificial

13

exercise to then embark on an analysis of a -- harmless

14

errors.

15

This Court has said time and again that

16

there is a close link between the alleged due-process or

17

Sixth Amendment violation and the manner in which the

18

due process -- the harmless-error analysis is conducted.

19
20
21

In Gonzales/Lopez that was the gist of much
of the debate between the majority of the JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would certainly agree

22

that if the only reason the Illinois Supreme Court used

23

the Federal harmless-error rule was because it was

24

assuming a Federal constitutional violation, once we

25

reject that assumption, the whole thing drops out.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is that entirely clear from the opinion?

2

MR. SCODRO:

I -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it clear that the

4

Illinois Supreme Court wouldn't have used the same test

5

under simply Illinois law?

6

MR. SCODRO:

Well, two points, Your Honor.

7

First, in context with the briefs which independently

8

sought both State and Federal remand and page 171 of the

9

joint appendix where the court makes clear that we are

10

simply not going to resolve the question of whether

11

there is a Federal due-process violation, I think in

12

context it does become clear what the court has done

13

here is it certainly concluded there is not a State

14

right.

15

So it proceeded to say, well, what if there

16

is a Federal due-process entitlement?

If that is the

17

case, let's proceed and decide, well, it's harmless

18

anyway.

We don't need to then reverse this conviction.

19

Now, I will say that if the Court harbors

20

concerns -- if the Court were to conclude there is no

21

due-process violation here, but harbors concerns that

22

the Illinois Supreme Court feels itself duty bound to

23

follow this Court's jurisprudence on the question of

24

harmlessness, then at that point the Court could simply

25

make a due-process ruling and remand to allow the
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Illinois Supreme Court to make clear what I think is

2

already clear -- but to make crystal clear that they

3

would apply a -- a harmless-error standard to this sort

4

-- this sort of declaration.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The problem is the -- the

6

only reason the Illinois Supreme Court found:

7

there was no error of constitutional dimension, meaning

8

Federal constitutional dimension.

9

it found that is because it found that the error was

10

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

11

MR. SCODRO:

12

The only reason it -

Your Honor, I think that what

they have done is they just put the statement -

13
14

That

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is the cart before the

horse.

15

MR. SCODRO:

They have run the analysis, and

16

what they have done, Your Honor, is said, look, any

17

error here of constitutional dimension would be

18

harmless.

19

we simply haven't reached the question.

20

read the foregoing analysis to suggest that we have made

21

a prior conclusion that there is indeed a due-process

22

violation here.

23

Therefore, we inform the reader on page 171
Please don't

Indeed, the court suggests there probably

24

isn't by early arguments that you are pointing out that

25

this Court has long held since -- since Hilt in 1919 has
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

long held that there is no due-process entitlement to a

2

peremptory challenge.

3

clear that what the Court has done is to say, there is

4

nothing in here for you under Illinois law.

5

Federal law, even if there were a due-process violation,

6

it is simply not -- it is simply harmless error.

7

So I think in context it is quite

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Under

Then -- then you would

8

have no objection to a remand that says, Illinois

9

Supreme Court, you can't blame it on Federal law.

It's

10

up to you as a matter of State law.

11

question that you didn't answer; that is, what is the

12

consequence under State law of an erroneous denial of a

13

peremptory?

14

remand?

15

And now answer the

You would have no objection to such a

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, we would have no

16

objection to that procedure, but I would caution that it

17

seems unnecessary in light of the fact that the parties

18

so sought relief under both State and Federal law and

19

the fact that the supreme court -- the Illinois Supreme

20

Court concludes it doesn't need to reach -- the way it

21

analyzes the -- the constitutional question.

22

I think that -- and this underlying

23

assumption that judges understand, I think it's fair to

24

assume that the Illinois justices understood they could

25

go further as a matter of State law than Federal, but
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not -- they couldn't provide fewer protections.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

For the reasons that have

3

been discussed, it may be that we won't get to the

4

merits of the Petitioner's argument, but assuming we do,

5

the Petitioner talks about the -- I don't have -- the

6

"unlawfully constituted jury."

7

extinction distinction between the hypothetical case of

8

the juror who isn't a resident of the county and the

9

State says you have to be a resident of the county -

Is -- is -- what is the

10

what is the distinction between that and, say, a

11

non-Article III judge sitting on a court of appeals

12

panel?

Why is one structural and the other not?

13

MR. SCODRO:

Well -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this would -- this

15

would be a little different than the juror who might be

16

biased or might not be biased, because this goes to a

17

hard qualification.

18

case, but it's a -- it's a linchpin to the Petitioner's

19

argument.

20

It's just a hypothetical in the

MR. SCODRO:

I should begin by saying that

21

the Gomez and Wingo and Nguyen decisions and others they

22

cite in that line for the non-Article III judge

23

proposition are themselves not due process decisions,

24

but are conclusions as a matter of State -- of Federal

25

law, rather, the idea being that Congress simply hadn't
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

delegated the authority properly in those cases.

2

are not due process cases.

3

They

But if one were to assume that those would

4

also be due process violations, to have a non-Article II

5

judge sit, I would distinguish those cases at that point

6

hypothetically by saying there is a profound, profound

7

difference between someone who lacks any and all mantle

8

of state authority, on the one hand, and a juror who is

9

properly sworn and who satisfies all the statutory

10

requirements for sitting as a matter of Illinois law.

11

And I should note, in the reply brief

12

there's a point at which they contend -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -- but the

14

hypothetical is it doesn't -- the juror doesn't satisfy

15

the requirement because he or she is from the wrong

16

county.

17

MR. SCODRO:

Again, Your Honor, the

18

fundamental -- the lodestar analysis here in the due

19

process appeal -- in Buford, the Court said it did not

20

define it with precision, but it has always been

21

fundamental fairness, a community sense of fair play and

22

decency.

23

It seems to me that, as you move into a

24

judge with absolutely no mantle of State authority or -

25

and -- whatsoever, versus a juror who is properly sworn,
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

properly instructed, but who nevertheless sits from a

2

different neighboring jurisdiction -- and I should note

3

that in Cook County there are three jury jurisdictions,

4

so the errors could be legion just within Cook County in

5

terms of being from the wrong part of the county.

6

seems to me that that sort of error simply doesn't come

7

anywhere close to the fundamental fairness -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

Well -- but how do

I mean, presumably the

10

State has a reason for restricting the jury pool to the

neighborhood, and that type of limitation does go back

12

to Blackstone, the vicinage of the crime.

13

there's no way to tell.

14

the juror from DuPage County is going to have a

15

different view of a different perspective or affected it

16

in a -- or that it affected the verdict in a particular

17

case.

This is true, Your Honor, but

19

in those contexts, the very State law that has created

20

those divisions, for whatever reason they have seen fit

21

to do so, is the proper authority to conclude whether or

22

not the error is so profound by having that person sit

it ought to be a void judgment.

We have

All

In those jurisdictions, to your knowledge -- you

I guess there's a new

10

trial.

The juror should have been excused, but wasn't.

11

I guess there's a new trial normally; is that right?

12

MR. SCODRO:

13

but not if the juror is unbiased -

14
15
16

If the juror is biased, yes,

JUSTICE BREYER:
Yes.

If the juror is biased.

Okay.
Now suppose it's the defendant who wanted

17

the juror and he was wrongly excused.

All right?

So

18

that's what the appeals court holds.

19

Again, do they go back and look and see if it's biased?

20

If the juror -- if the defendant didn't get the juror he

21

wanted, somebody else took his place, do they look to

22

see if that person was biased?

23

bad, defendant, you may have been right, but you lost

24

the jury that you want, no remedy?

25

MR. SCODRO:

What's the rule?

And if not, say, too

What happens?

It's my understanding -- I
39

1

don't believe -- I don't have cases to cite on that -

2

but I don't believe there would be a remedy because this

3

Court has said time and again that the preemptory right

4

and those surrounding it do not create a right to any

5

particular jury.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, at least in the case of

7

where he failed to get a preemptory, whether it's

8

Federal or whether it's State, the Federal law and most

9

State law is:

You lost your right to a preemptory, one

10

of them.

You should have had it, but you are out of

11

luck, if -- if the juror who replaced the replacement,

12

the juror who was there, you know, who otherwise

13

wouldn't have been is a fair juror.

14

MR. SCODRO:

Your Honor, I thought you were

wanted did not sit, and under those circumstances, I

Federal, and therefore you don't have the same concern

3

about a threshold due process violation.

4

I will say, to answer your original question

5

as well about jurors who should not have sat but are not

6

deemed biased, Illinois certainly has a history of cases

7

to that effect, and the court -- the Illinois court has

8

handled them as a matter of Illinois law.

12

under those circumstances.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. SCODRO:

What was that case?

This is not cited in the

briefs, so I'm only citing it in response to a question.

16

It's a case called Chase from the Illinois Supreme Court

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. SCODRO:

Oh, Illinois -

-- in 1886.

And it's a case in

20

which an alien sat on the jury, and there was, I

21

believe, as part of the court's analysis a failure to

22

make a contemporaneous objection, but they said it was

23

not a "nullity," to use the court's words, to seat this

24

improper juror and, again, made as a determination of

25

Illinois law, just as the question here as to what
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

remedy should be in effect is purely a question of

2

Illinois law.

3

Again, they have simply failed to establish

4

a due process violation.

This Court has said time and

5

again there is no due process entitlement to peremptory

6

challenges.

7

depends, hinges, upon that presumption, including the

8

Baston line, as the concurrence in Miller-El pointed out

9

in 2005, numerous restrictions on peremptories that have

in the government's brief.

12

remarkable variety amongst States, which has been

touched upon today, where States -- State by State -

14

provide very different numbers of peremptory challenges,

15

and they provide very different limits thereon as well.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And then, indeed, the

If the judge who sat on a

State trial was not authorized under State law to hear

that particular matter, would that be a due process

19

violation?

20

MR. SCODRO:

I think the answer to that is

21

no, Your Honor.

And indeed, as we point out in our

22

brief, Cook County has several substantive divisions, so

23

that, for example, a criminal law division judge is not

24

authorized to sit on a family law matter, for example.

25

And yet Illinois law has made clear that if there's an

error, if you go to the wrong court and that is unlikely

2

to happen in the scenario I put forth, but it could

easily happen between law and chancery for example, and

does indeed happen.

5

any error in going to the wrong court and having the

judgment as a matter of law.

think that would implicate due process concerns.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

14

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

15

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

16

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

17
18

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

Federal law does not require automatic

20

reversal of a conviction because the denial of a

21

peremptory challenge at most violated only his State law

22

rights.

23

had been violated, harmless error review would apply.

24

The Constitution does not give criminal defendants the

25

right to peremptory challenges; therefore, a -- the

And even if his Federal constitutional rights

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right of a State defendant like Petitioner to exercise

2

peremptory challenges derives entirely from State law,

3

and when erroneous denial of a preemptory challenge

4

deprives him only of State law right, and when the State

5

law rights alone have been violated, State law not

6

federal law dictates whether harmless error review

7

applies.

8

rise to a due process -- federal due process violation

9

unless it deprives the defendant of a fair trial.

The violation of a State law right doesn't

10

And this Court has repeatedly held

11

that States can withhold preemptory challenges entirely

12

without impairing the right to an impartial jury or a

13

fair trial.

14

denial of a single preemptory challenge does not render

15

a trial fundamentally unfair.

16

It, therefore, follows that the erroneous

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if it's not a single

17

challenge.

18

the trial judge just arbitrarily refuses to allow a

19

defendant to exercise any preemptory challenge, but the

20

jury -- the jury is ultimately selected, there is no

21

reason to think it's not a fair jury?

22

What if, let's say, each side has six, and

MR. ROBERTS:

We'd still thing that that

23

would not be a federal constitutional violation, and

24

even if it were some kind of a federal violation, that

25

it would be subject to review for harmlessness.
44
Alderson Reporting Company

If the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

trial court could violate due process, if its actions so

2

skewed the balance of power over the selection of the

3

jury in favor of the government that it resulted in a

4

fundamentally unfair trial, but even the denial of

5

multiple preemptory challenges wouldn't rise to that

6

level.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Suppose the Illinois had a

8

statute that the prosecution gets 10 peremptories and

9

the defendants get one, would that raise a federal

10

question?

11

MR. ROBERTS:

The question there would be

12

whether that so skewed -- the test that I said before.

13

I think the question would be that that's so skewed

14

about -

15
16
17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't the answer pretty

clear that that would be unfair.
MR. ROBERTS:

I don't -- I don't think that

18

the answer is clear at all.

The State might rationally

19

conclude that because the government has to prove its

20

case beyond a reasonable doubt, because it has to

21

convince the jurors unanimously to rule in its favor and

22

because it has no right to appeal an unfavorable

23

determination by the jury, that the prosecution should

24

be entitled to more preemptory challenges.

It's unlikely to, but But what about the The reason it's unlikely

is it is so clearly unconstitutional.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we don't think it's

8

unconstitutional at all, Your Honor, but it is contrary

9

to what the common practice and the way things have been

10
11

approached in both the federal and State court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Roberts, if you do

12

get to harmless error, how do you deal with the question

13

that was raised by the Chief Justice, that is, there is

14

no way in the world that you can tell whether this was

15

harmless or not?

16

juror being on the panel, that juror could have swung

17

the case, could have had no influence, there is just no

18

way of knowing what would happen.

19

You would have to imagine another

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think that rests on

20

the mistaken premise that harmless error now just turns

21

on the predilections of the particular decisionmaker or

22

on speculation about what one particular juror would

23

have done differently than another.

24

error -- the harmless error inquiry looks at the

25

hypothetical objective rational juror.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

In fact, harmless

And so, that's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what you look at and the difference between -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but maybe -

3

maybe you have an -- you know, the irrational juror.

4

You know, the holdout is not going to convict for any

5

reason.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

But -- but that is not an

7

appropriate part of -- of a harmless error analysis just

8

like the fact that the jury might engage in

9

nullification is an appropriate part of the harmless

10
11

element.
If -- in Strickland, which is the best case,

12

I think, to explain how that is irrelevant to the

13

inquiry, even though it's part of the constitutional

14

there -- analysis there, the Court very clearly explains

15

that you don't look at the particular decisionmaker, you

16

don't speculate about nullification and about arbitrary

17

action and the like, it sort of transferable over.

18

That's just not an appropriate part -- analysis.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, even assuming

20

your premise, isn't it pretty difficult to know what a

21

rational juror would have done?

22

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we think that the

23

correct inquiry in this circumstance, given the nature

24

of the right, is to ask whether the error resulted in

25

the seating of a juror that was not impartial.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

And then

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you look at the record in the case, the voir dire

2

record, and make that determination, and the government

3

bears the -- bears the burden of proof.

4

So we don't think that that would be

5

difficult to do, Your Honor.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that is almost the

7

same, at least in some states, as getting a new trial

8

anyway.

9

biased, and in some States that's a reason for a new

10

trial in the discretion of the trial court, anyway.

11

15

If we find out after the fact that the jury was

MR. ROBERTS:

That -- that -- that could be,

but JUSTICE STEVENS:

The point is you are not

giving much substance to the rule.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I think we are

16

respecting its fundamental -- its fundamental purpose,

17

Your Honor, which is to assist to help achieve the goal

18

of selecting an impartial juror.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the law there?

20

That's what I am trying to get at.

I mean, my initial

21

instinct would be that if a defendant doesn't get the

22

jury that the law entitles him to, that's an error.

23

you normally would think it was harmful, because you

24

can't say, in honesty, it was harmless, it's the jury

25

that's supposed to decide.

And

I suspect it would work out
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that way.

2

worked out?

3

I have never looked into it. How has it

MR. ROBERTS:

Generally for errors like the

4

error you described before, where the judge

5

erroneously -- mistakenly excuses a juror in the belief

6

that the juror is disqualified for cause, where the

7

judge mistakenly substitutes a qualified alternate for

8

one of the jurors, or the judge places one alternate on

9

the jury instead of another, the courts have generally

10

looked at that for harmlessness and has not required

11

automatic reversal.

12
13

Indeed, even in the case of jurors that
don't satisfy -

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So in other

words, they have often said you don't get a new trial?

16

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

Yes.

And even in the case of

19

jurors that don't meet the statutory requirements in the

20

federal courts of appeals have held that unless a biased

21

juror sits, a new trial is not required.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But don't some of those

23

courts, rather than focusing on the qualifications of

24

the particular juror, look to the -- how close the case

25

was?
49
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. ROBERTS:

The harmless error analysis,

2

there are sort of a lot of different scenarios of types

3

of violations, and the standard that they use is not

4

clear in all of them.

5

that I found that involve the seating of jurors that

6

don't meet the federal statutory requirements, usually

7

they involve felons that didn't reveal that they were

8

felons, the courts have looked to the biased juror

standard.

In the ones that -- the cases

Some courts have done that, others have

looked to whether it affects the verdict.

been exactly clear how you determine that, but -

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They haven't

That's because there

is no way to tell.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I -- I think that -

16

that even if you had a standard that said to look to

17

whether there was an effect on the verdict, you can tell

18

precisely the way the Illinois Supreme Court applied

19

Neder here, if no rational jury could have acquitted,

20

then you know the substitution of one rational,

21

impartial juror for another didn't have an effect on the

22

outcome.

23

to do that, Your Honor, because the underlying right -

24

the underlying error doesn't violate the Sixth

25

Amendment.

And that doesn't violate the Sixth Amendment

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But a jury is a

2

fundamental protection of individual liberty, and in

3

your analysis you are having a judge decide what the

4

jury would -

5

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

As

6

Justice Ginsburg pointed out before, the Petitioner here

7

got a determination of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt

8

on every element of the offense from a fair and

9

impartial jury that was properly instructed.

10

So we are

not having a judge substitute that at all.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The judge is making

12

a determination that a juror that should have been

13

sitting would act like the juror who was sitting

14

instead.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

That is true.

But the Sixth

16

Amendment doesn't give the defendant the right to any

17

particular jury, it doesn't give the defendant the right

18

to a jury that has been selected in compliance with

19

every jot and frivolous State law.

20

the underlying error, as the underlying error here where

21

you get a denial of preemptory, where a juror is seated

22

that even though that violated state law, assumably

23

here, that -- that that doesn't amount to a Sixth

24

Amendment violation.

25

And therefore, if

And if the defendant got his Sixth Amendment
51
Alderson Reporting Company

rights at trial, then the way you conduct harmless error

2

review can't violate his Sixth Amendment rights.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I -- we would obviously

like to have sort of alternative rulings that do both,

but I think the most logical way to approach the case is

12

to decide whether there was a violation of the

Constitution here, and because there wasn't one, to say

that State law governs the harmless error analysis.

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

As to the Sixth Amendment issue, the

2

Illinois Supreme Court did act inconsistently with the

3

Sixth Amendment as far as its manner of conducting

4

harmless error review, because harmless error review is

5

impossible to conduct in this situation, because in

6

order to do that, we would have to examine what the

7

particular jury would have done had it not been for the

error; and the particular jury in this case must be out,

9

because there the particular jury, the panel as a whole,

For example evidence is erroneously excluded from the
