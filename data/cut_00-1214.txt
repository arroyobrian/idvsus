ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. PRYOR, JR.


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8
9
10

MR. PRYOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:

30 years ago in Argersinger v. Hamlin and then


11

more than 20 years ago in Scott v. Illinois, this Court


12

established the principle that, under the Sixth and


13

Fourteenth Amendments, a State is not obligated to provide


14

an indigent defendant in a misdemeanor case court-


15

appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel, provided that the


16

defendant is not actually imprisoned upon conviction.


17
18
19

8 years ago in Nichols v. the United States,

this Court reaffirmed that principle. 

The Supreme Court of Alabama distorted this


20

well-established and workable rule and held that a


21

probated or suspended sentence, which actually liberates a


22

defendant to return to free society, nevertheless triggers


23

a right to court-appointed and taxpayer-funded counsel. 


24

There are three arguments that I would like to


25

address this morning.

QUESTION:

Do you -- do you concede that the


2

State can never impose the original sentence of time in


3

jail? 


4

MR. PRYOR:

Your Honor, obviously that is not a


5

court -- a question that this Court has directly addressed


6

in either Argersinger or Scott.

7

QUESTION:

Our best reading --


I'm asking whether the State of


8

Alabama concedes that it can't ever impose that original


9

sentence. 


10

MR. PRYOR:

Our reading of Scott is that -- that


11

we cannot activate the suspended sentence.

12

that Mr. Fried, as an amicus, certainly has a plausible


13

reading that would allow the court to activate that


14

sentence.

15

back to the original offense and that the court --


16

We acknowledge


In our judgment, that original sentence relates


QUESTION:

What -- what happens in Alabama if --


17

if a -- a criminal defendant is convicted of a misdemeanor


18

and placed on probation and then violates probation?

19

that enable the State to impose the original sentence for


20

violation of the probation?


21

MR. PRYOR:

Yes, ordinarily it would.

Does


But for


22

the problem presented involving an uncounseled defendant,


23

it would allow the State to activate the suspended


24

sentence. 


25

QUESTION:

Well, then we're jumping probably


4

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ahead into what you're going to tell us, but while we're


2

at this point, it seems to me that if -- if you say that


3

the sentence cannot be reimposed, you're saying that the


4

State courts are in the position of imposing a sentence


5

that is something of a rouse.

6

courts in this position?

7

very sound for us to tell the State courts, well, you go


8

ahead and tell these people that they can -- might be put


9

in prison, but that that won't really happen.

10
11

Why should you put your own


I -- I just don't think it's


It seems to


me that that's your position. 

MR. PRYOR:

Well, there's still a risk of


12

imprisonment, the same risk of imprisonment, under our


13

reading of Argersinger and Scott, that -- that is


14

accompanied with the judgment of a mere fine.

15

has the power to enforce any judgment as an essential


16

aspect of the administration of justice through the power


17

of contempt.


18

QUESTION:

Every court


But you're -- you're treating the


19

contempt proceeding, in effect, as a separate proceeding


20

then, and I take it, though I'm not sure that I remember


21

this from your briefs -- I take it that on -- on your view


22

of the way the scheme ought to operate in the contempt


23

proceeding, before there could be any confinement on a


24

finding of contempt, that counsel would have to be


25

provided then if -- if the individual is indigent and


5

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

didn't waive it.


2
3

MR. PRYOR:

That's -- that's correct, Justice


Souter. 


4

QUESTION:

So, it's the separate counseled


5

proceeding that distinguishes your case from -- from the


6

case that Mr. Fried argues for. 


7

MR. PRYOR:

That -- that's correct, Justice


8

Souter.

And -- and at a minimum I would say, although I


9

don't think the Court has to ever address this question


10

because there's been no violation of probation -- at a


11

minimum the State would have the same power to enforce its


12

judgment that it would a judgment of a mere fine which


13

this Court held squarely in Scott does not trigger a right


14

to court-appointed --


15

QUESTION:

From your point of view, General


16

Pryor, what does the State gain as -- as opposed to what


17

the Supreme Court of Alabama said, by following --


18

following your -- your line of reasoning?

19

Justice Kennedy said, it -- it imposes a sentence, but a


20

sentence that everybody knows can't be enforced.


21

MR. PRYOR:

I think as


The State gains the powerful tool of


22

probation to rehabilitate an offender that the State


23

believes is a good risk, a risk to return to free society


24

who can be rehabilitated, depending on whatever mechanisms


25

of probation have been adopted by the trial court. 


6

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Meanwhile, the State is preserving its scarce judicial


2

resources to incarcerate more dangerous offenders and


3

provide counsel in more serious cases. 


4

QUESTION:

But what -- how effective is


5

probation going to be if there isn't the threat of -- of a


6

sentence in case of probation violation? 


7

MR. PRYOR:

I think at a minimum, the probation


8

is going to be as effective as a judgment of a fine


9

because the State is going to still have the flexible


10

power of contempt, whether civil or criminal in nature, to


11

ensure that its orders are followed and -- and will


12

continue to exercise jurisdiction of the probationer


13

during that period of probation. 


14

QUESTION:

Is it the -- is it the case in


15

Alabama that probation cannot be imposed without a


16

suspended sentence?


17

MR. PRYOR:

18
19

That is correct.

Technically that


is how probation is imposed, Justice Souter. 

QUESTION:

Wouldn't -- wouldn't we have at least


20

a more candid system or wouldn't the interaction of


21

Argersinger and -- and the Alabama system, as you view


22

Argersinger, produce a more candid system if -- if we took


23

the position that, no, they can't impose a suspended


24

sentence, and Alabama would then presumably amend its laws


25

so that probation could be imposed without imposing a


7

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

suspended sentence, and you on your view would have your


2

-- your contempt remedy.

3

-- the two systems wouldn't be producing this kind of


4

silly effect of -- of a sentence which everyone realizes


5

as such cannot be imposed. 


6

MR. PRYOR:

We wouldn't be -- in effect, the


Alabama certainly has the freedom to


7

adopt I think either system without running afoul of the


8

Constitution, which is the -- the issue before this Court.


9

Although it might make more sense and not seem as silly to


10

impose probation without going through the mechanics of --


11

QUESTION:

Well, is -- is there any State which


12

imposes probation without a suspended sentence that you


13

know of? 


14

MR. PRYOR:

I know from the amicus brief of the


15

National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers that


16

there are some States that impose, in fact, pretrial


17

probation, that that is something that --


18
19
20

QUESTION:

How about post-trial, after a


conviction? 

MR. PRYOR:

I just don't know.

I know that


21

there were several States that were cited in Shelton's


22

briefly correctly that -- that used the same mechanism


23

that Alabama does.

There were several cites --


24

QUESTION:

General Pryor --


25

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what authority would --


8

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would the State have to -- to put somebody on probation


2

unless -- unless it is the suspension of -- of a judgment


3

of incarceration?

4

saying you're going to be on probation? 


I mean, can a State just go around


5

MR. PRYOR:

6

QUESTION:

Well --

It seems to me the only -- the only


7

reason it -- it has that grip over the person is that --


8

is that it has a right to incarcerate him. 


9
10

MR. PRYOR:

The States certainly view that as an


effective mechanism in most --

QUESTION:

11

I'm not sure there's an alternative


12

to it.

13

can put on probation whomever they want to put on


14

probation.


15

I'm not sure you can just pass a law saying judges


MR. PRYOR:

I think that -- that the Alabama


16

legislature has the inherent power to define what a


17

sentence is, whether a sentence is a fine or whether a


18

sentence is imprisonment.

19

would have the flexibility to define a sentence -- one of


20

the sentencing options as -- as probation.


21

QUESTION:

And in fact, I think the State


I take it what they would do on that


22

scheme would be to say, upon conviction of offense A, the


23

court may impose probation, and if the conditions of


24

probation are violated and are shown in a separate trial


25

or proceeding to that effect, the violation itself can be


9

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

punished.

That would be the way the scheme would work,


2

wouldn't it? 


3

MR. PRYOR:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. PRYOR:

That's correct.

If -- if Alabama wanted it. 

If Alabama wanted it.

But -- but


6

this is really -- in my judgment this would be elevating


7

form over substance because the -- the effect is the same


8

with whichever system Alabama wants to adopt --


9

QUESTION:

General Pryor, explain to me how some


10

other States approach it.

11

there is no trial.

12

condition that the -- the defendant abide by certain terms


13

and conditions.

MR. PRYOR:

15

QUESTION:

MR. PRYOR:

18

QUESTION:

22

And if -- if the defendant then


Then it proceeds to trial. 

How many States use a system like


that?

MR. PRYOR:

20
21

That's -- that's correct.


doesn't live up to it, then it proceeds to trial.


17

19

It's a deferred prosecution on


Is that how it works? 


14

16

If I understand correctly,


I believe the -- the brief listed 23


States.

QUESTION:

Well, these are pretrial diversion


23

programs which have been very helpful in the drug context,


24

but they're extremely expensive to administer. 


25

MR. PRYOR:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

And -- and


10

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

many States may very well feel that -- that there's


2

something almost unseemly about using this kind of


3

bargaining process before you have adjudicated guilt or


4

innocence, and -- and the State certainly should have


5

the --


6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

Well, why is it any more unseemly


than the ordinary plea bargain? 

MR. PRYOR:

Because at least in the -- in the


case of the ordinary plea bargain, the defendant comes


10

forward and admits the wrongdoing.

11

reliability there for the State that's not present in this


12

kind of pretrial system.

13

their system to adjudicate innocence or guilt may find


14

that that's a -- that the system that Alabama has is a


15

preferable system. 


16

QUESTION:

17

pretrial diversion.

18

MR. PRYOR:

There's an indicia of


And -- and the States who trust


But Shelton was not given any

He was convicted, was he not? 

That's correct, and Alabama doesn't


19

have it in this context except with respect to drug


20

offenders. 


21

QUESTION:

General Pryor, I can understand a


22

line between a fine and any kind of confinement, and


23

probation may involve no immediate incarceration, but it


24

does involve what could be very significant restraints on


25

the person.

So, isn't it more logical to draw the line


11

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

between money only on the one hand and confinement, be it


2

in jail or under terms and conditions of probation?


3

MR. PRYOR:

Justice Ginsburg, I'd say no for a


4

couple of reasons.

This Court has recognized that


5

imprisonment is an intrinsically different form of


6

punishment that has special constitutional significance. 


7

The probation system is one that is meant more as


8

rehabilitation and not as punishment to give an offender a


9

second chance in free society.

And -- and even with the


10

judgment of a fine, as I mentioned earlier, there -- it --


11

it is accompanied by the risk of imprisonment should the


12

defendant willfully refuse to pay that fine.

13

that context, in the judgment of -- of a fine, there is at


14

least that risk, the same risk that would exist under the


15

regime that we propose.


So, even in


16

I do not discount the fact that probation has --


17

can have serious restrictions on liberty, but it's not the


18

-- the deprivation of liberty, the loss of physical


19

liberty, that is, physical confinement that this Court has


20

held triggers a right to court-appointed counsel under the


21

Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

QUESTION:

22

Under your view, if you enforced the


23

jail sentence through the contempt mechanism and reached


24

the same result, I take it you now have a second jury


25

trial. 


12

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PRYOR:

Well, I guess it would be dependent


2

in part on the nature of the contempt proceeding.

3

civil contempt, if it's a direct contempt or an indirect


4

contempt, but if it's criminal contempt, I would imagine


5

-- I say that.

6

only has a maximum term of imprisonment of 5 days.

7

I'm not sure that -- that there would be a right to a jury


8

trial. 


9

If it's


In Alabama, a criminal contempt procedure

So,


For more than 20 --


10

QUESTION:

But then -- but then the contempt is


11

-- is really not a substitute of an equivalent for the --


12

for the imposition of the suspended sentence.

13

equivalent.

14

the suspended sentence.


If it's just 5 days, that's not equivalent to


MR. PRYOR:

15

They're not


Oh, absolutely.

That's absolutely


16

right, although I would argue that -- that the threat of


17

imprisonment is still enough to give the probationer an


18

incentive to follow the orders of the court.

19

absolutely correct that there is a material difference


20

between activation of the probated sentence in this case


21

and the use of -- of the criminal contempt remedy that's


22

provided by the code of Alabama.

23

that. 


24
25

It's


There's no doubt about


The -- what is at stake in this case is -- is

the use of probation, a valuable tool for the States that


13

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

allow them the freedom and flexibility again to ensure


2

that scarce judicial resources can be preserved for more


3

serious cases to provide counsel and to incarcerate more


4

serious offenders. 


5

If there are no further questions from the


6

Court, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance


7

of my time for rebuttal. 


8

QUESTION:

Very well, General Pryor. 


9

Mr. Fried, we'll hear from you.


10

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED


11

ON BEHALF OF THE AMICUS CURIAE


12
13
14

IN OPPOSITION TO THE JUDGMENT BELOW

MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


15

First, if I might just refer to the deferred


16

prosecution point, which was raised by Mr. Duke in his


17

amicus brief and in one of the questions.

18

a red herring because, as Mr. Duke points out, the


19

deferred prosecution requires the consent of both the


20

prosecutor and the defendant.

21

prosecutions we have here are usually not consented to by


22

the defendant. 


23

I think it is --


24

QUESTION:

25

I think that's


Obviously, the kind of


Why -- why is that a red herring? 


Because I got from your brief the impression that the --


14

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- there's a practical problem that a lot of States do


2

without giving people lawyers.

3

thousands of cases say, go plead guilty.

4

some light sentence that won't involve prison, but then


5

they attach to that a suspended sentence.

6

wondered is, well, isn't the solution to this to say --


7

it's called pretrial diversion or pretrial probation or


8

they call it different names, but to say if you violate


9

the condition, what happens to you is not prison, what


Perhaps thousands and

We'll give you


And what I


10

happens to you is the trial that we haven't yet given you


11

with a lawyer.

12

practical matter in a lot of these States in a lot of the


13

cases to which you referred. 


14

MR. FRIED:

And I thought maybe that works as a


It -- it does work.

For instance,


15

we use it a great deal in the Commonwealth of


16

Massachusetts where there is a quite different rule from


17

-- from the Argersinger rule where in Massachusetts we say


18

if there's a risk of imprisonment, you must get a lawyer. 


19

And a number of States have that rule which is perhaps why


20

they also have the deferred prosecution. 


21

I say it's a red herring because what we're


22

considering today is not the very best possible system but


23

what is the constitutional minimum.

24

brief on Nichols is not in order to show that Nichols


25

somehow resolves this question in favor of allowing the


Our emphasis in the


15

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

probated sentence and in favor of allowing it then to be


2

activated on violation, but rather Nichols shows that the


3

question is an open one.

4

then neither does Argersinger.

5

and it's a mistake the Alabama Supreme Court made to treat


6

Argersinger as having resolved this question. 


7

Nichols doesn't resolve it, but

And I think it's a mistake


Argersinger made quite clear that there is a


8

continuum here all the way from mere due process, which


9

was the law prior to Gideon, to a criminal -- to the right


10

of a criminal defendant having a counsel in any criminal


11

case.

12

Court recognized had a certain arbitrariness, and it


13

picked it for reasons of practicality and fairness.

14

those considerations of practicality and fairness require


15

no more than that there be counsel if the person is


16

sentenced immediately then and there to prison. 


17

And it picked a point.

It picked a point which the


And


The fairness aspect is, as the Illinois court


18

pointed out, that in these cases the defendant carries the


19

key to the prison in his own pocket.

20

in prison is a matter of his choice whether or not he


21

violates the terms of the probation. 


22

Whether he ends up


That's why I think Mr. Duke enters two more red


23

herrings into the argument.

The stay on appeal. 


24

Obviously in a stay case, the keys are not in the pocket


25

of the defendant, but in the pocket of the appeals court. 


16

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And the 30-day or $30 prison which is executed


2

immediately, in those cases the fine is either an illegal


3

fine under the -- this Court's decision in Bierdon -- the


4

person doesn't pay because he cannot, and that is itself a


5

constitutional violation -- or once again, he is


6

imprisoned because he chooses not to pay.

7

that is the fairness point.

8
9

And once again,


The keys are in his pocket.


That is a reasonable place to draw the line

because of the very important practicalities.

The


10

practicalities are the literally millions of misdemeanor


11

cases, the very large number -- it's hard to say exactly


12

what the number is -- the very large number of


13

probationary misdemeanor sentences, and the fact that


14

those probationary sentences overwhelmingly are intended


15

to serve a rehabilitative or preventive function.

You do allow the possibility that

Not against the crime itself.

That is correct. 

Well, it would -- it would also

22

and knowingly made originally. 


23

MR. FRIED:

That could be brought up.

Nothing

probation hearing you reexamine the validity of the

original offense, the original conviction?


6

MR. FRIED:

The -- Alabama is a good example of


7

what is open at probation.

In most jurisdictions, oddly


8

enough, not in Massachusetts -- in most jurisdictions, the


9

court on probation is free to impose new -- the revocation


10

proceeding -- new conditions, the sentence that has


11

already been imposed, or a lesser sentence in light of all


12

circumstances, and it mentions specifically

Yes, but all those alternatives

QUESTION:

MR. FRIED:

At least in a typical case.

you're asking whether this will depreciate the gravity of

Do we have any idea of the 1.4

million to 1.8 million people who are on probation for


13

misdemeanors, of what percentage of those cases the -- the

MR. FRIED:

I


We try --

That's a rather -- yes.

We try to infer that in the brief. 


19

It's -- the statistics are not kept in a transparent or


20

useful way.

21

It may be in the hundreds of thousands because as -- as we


22

explain in our brief, there are a very large number of


23

persons on probation who did not have lawyers, and given


24

Argersinger, we may assume that they were misdemeanors.


25

So, it's a very large number. 


But it may be in the hundreds of thousands. 


20

Alderson Reporting Company

1

But the number of persons who are actually


2

incarcerated for breach of those conditions is quite


3

small.

4

becomes quite practical to offer an attorney to help in


5

that condition, but really I think very confining and


6

perhaps with a perverse effect to require it as a


7

constitutional minimum in the much larger -- very much


8

larger number of cases where the matter is first

considered.

10

It's in the thousands.

And that's why I think it

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. MILLS


17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


18
19
20

Mr.


MR. MILLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:

It obviously is apparent here that both the


21

petitioner and the respondent come to this Court relying


22

on the same authority, the -- primarily the Argersinger


23

and Scott cases. 


24
25

It seems that the State is taking a rather

shallow view, in our judgment, of the Argersinger and


21

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Scott cases both as to their background and how


2

Argersinger is -- is implemented and the effect of that


3

implementation.


4
5
6

QUESTION:

Do you agree that neither of those


cases squarely control the outcome here? 

MR. MILLS:

It -- it would be my position that


7

Argersinger does by the -- some of the pronouncements that


8

it makes.


9

QUESTION:

Certainly the holding does not.


10

MR. MILLS:

11

And it would further be my position that -- that


12

the Scott case has something to say to us about this issue


13

also, although the holding -- the -- the facts certainly


14

do not coincide with this case. 


15

The holding does not certainly.


It seems to me that the background of the


16

Argersinger and Scott cases, of course, are the -- the


17

Powell v. Alabama, Gideon v. Wainwright series of cases. 


18

And in those cases, it seems that the Court has


19

established the purpose of the Counsel Clause which if we


20

-- if we reduce to its barest terms is this.

21

of the Counsel Clause is to prevent, to the extent humanly


22

possible, the conviction of the innocent in an adversary


23

proceeding.

24

in Powell v. Alabama and what Justice Black said in Gideon


25

v. Wainwright, that what is to be done is to eliminate the


The purpose


That seems to be what Justice Sutherland said

risk that the innocent may be convicted.


2

And when we come to the Argersinger case,


3

although the -- the Gideon case had -- had spoken of this


4

as being a -- or nobel idea was the -- were the words used


5

-- but I believe spoke of counsel for every defendant in


6

every case as being a constitutional ideal.

7

Argersinger, the Court was faced with the argument of


8

practicability and expense and -- and the other arguments


9

that -- that the State makes in this case, that the


I think in


10

mandate can't be absolute, that there must be some


11

accommodation to those arguments.

And in Argersinger, it -- it seems that the


12
13

Court made those accommodations.
QUESTION:

14
15

only?

Okay.

16

Amendment to that. 


And if we include --


Well, the Court basically said, fine


We're not going to extend the Sixth


Now, here we have a State that says, well, we


17
18

know we can't enforce the sentence.

It's a toothless


19

tiger.

20

I mean, we'll -- we'll maybe have proceedings, but we --


21

we can never enforce the sentence.

22

should we be concerned here? 


23

MR. MILLS:

We'll say probation, but it -- we don't mean it. 


In light of that,


Well, that -- that puzzled me


24

somewhat when the State made that concession in its reply


25

brief that this was in -- in effect a sham sentence.

And


23

Alderson Reporting Company

1

I see no authority in the law of Alabama or any other


2

State that I'm aware of that authorizes a court --

QUESTION:

4

think about this? 


5

Well, if that's the case, what do we


MR. MILLS:

Perhaps we're dealing with a sham


6

sentence.

7

Court treated it.

8

this Court or any other court, an authorization for a


9

trial court to enter a sentence that can't be enforced.


10

And perhaps that's the way the Alabama Supreme

But certainly there shouldn't be, from


QUESTION:

Would you just clarify one thing for


11

me?

Did the Alabama Supreme Court endorse that view, or


12

is that the Attorney General?


13

MR. MILLS:

That's the Attorney General's view. 


14

What the Alabama petit court -- Supreme Court did was


15

merely strike the sentence.


16

QUESTION:

I guess whether you strike it or not


17

is a matter of State law, isn't it?

I mean -- I don't


18

know what the remedy should be for a sentence that's not


19

-- not an enforceable sentence and the person writes it in


20

the -- the judge writes in the book, suspended sentence. 


21

And the State and everyone else, let's say, agree that


22

that isn't a lawful sentence.

23

says, erase those words.

24

that was a matter of Federal law or what you do under


25

State law when a --


So, the State Supreme Court


Strike them.

MR. MILLS:

Well, I believe the Alabama Supreme


QUESTION:

That it be struck rather than just


left to lie there unenforceable.


5

MR. MILLS:

I'm not sure they articulated in


6

those terms, but their -- their basis for reaching the


7

decision they reached was the Federal cases that deal with


8

the right of counsel. 


9

QUESTION:

One of the things that didn't happen,


10

we know for sure, in this case was that an offer of


11

counsel.

12

court's part or does Alabama not provide assigned counsel


13

for indigents in -- in a misdemeanor like this? 


Was that merely a -- an inadvertence on the


MR. MILLS:

14

Perhaps it was inadvertence, but the


15

-- the Alabama rules of criminal procedure have that as a


16

part of the -- the processing of any -- any case. 


17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MILLS:

19

QUESTION:

In any misdemeanor?

Any criminal prosecution, yes, sir.

All right.

So that if -- if there


20

had been -- if there were an offense in Alabama that


21

carried as much as a 1-day sentence, the State would


22

provide counsel for an indigent, at least if requested?

MR. MILLS:

23

Not -- not in those terms.

Not -- I


24

believe the Alabama rules say where constitutionally


25

required.

And of course the --


25

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

So, they're not providing counsel in


2

these cases now because, I take it, the State's position


3

is it's not constitutionally required.


4

MR. MILLS:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

At what point do they regard it as


6

being constitutionally required?

When the sentence can


7

exceed 6 months or what?

8

want to know -- I want your response to the argument that


9

there's going to be a -- a great practical difference if


What -- what I'm getting at is I


10

we say now you may not impose sentences like this at all,


11

even though they're merely suspended.

12

the practical difference is.


13

MR. MILLS:

I want to know what


From the -- the wording of the


14

Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure about appointment of


15

counsel at the present time, I would assume that the trial


16

judge must go through the process outlined in Argersinger,


17

that is, make the pretrial determination of whether


18

imprisonment is a likely punishment in this particular


19

case, and if -- if so, appoint counsel.

20

counsel is not appointed. 


21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

If not so,


Well, any imprisonment?

1 day of


imprisonment? 

QUESTION:

Isn't that what the Federal --


Argersinger requires? 

MR. MILLS:

I think that's what Argersinger

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

says.

QUESTION:

Okay.

But Alabama, in other words,


is not doing something eccentric in this respect. 


4

MR. MILLS:

5

QUESTION:

That -- that's correct. 

The -- the only difference then


6

between the cases in which -- misdemeanor cases, for


7

example, in which counsel is offered, if an individual is


8

indigent, and counsel is not offered are cases in which


9

the judge says in advance I'm not going to put this guy


10
11
12
13

away at all even if we convict him.

MR. MILLS:

Presumably that's the process that's


being followed. 

QUESTION:

Now, do you have -- do you have any


14

basis to tell us what practical difference it would make


15

if the judge said, well, I may impose a suspended sentence


16

and therefore I will have to offer counsel because I read


17

Argersinger as requiring that?

18

difference that would make in practical terms?

19

cases would counsel have to be offered and potentially


20

provided for where it's not being offered and potentially


21

provided for now?


22

MR. MILLS:

Do you know what

How many


I don't have any data that would --


23

would support that, but it -- but it would seem that if


24

the trial judge makes the pretrial determination that any


25

sentence, whether -- whether immediate or suspended, is


27

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

warranted or may be warranted in this particular case,


2

that counsel should be appointed -- of course, that's the


3

position. 


4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MILLS:

6

QUESTION:

I understand that. 

That's the position. 

Mr. Mills, there is one thing that I


7

think is a piece of information that -- that is in the


8

record, and that is that most non-indigent misdemeanors


9

appear in court without counsel.

So, the position that


10

you're urging is kind of a superior justice for the


11

indigents.

12

at the end of the line, there may be any jail time,


13

although most people who can't afford counsel do not have


14

counsel in cases of -- of this kind.


Counsel, you would say, in every case where,


MR. MILLS:

15

That perhaps is correct.

I suppose


16

my response to that would be that that's -- that that's a


17

free choice that the non-indigent makes.

QUESTION:

18

Isn't it true also -- isn't it true


19

also, at least according to some of the statistics quoted,


20

that frequently these cases are not prosecuted by lawyers? 


21

They're simply prosecuted by the arresting officer. 

MR. MILLS:

22

That happens occasionally in


23

Alabama.

It used to happen a lot.

24

rare at the present time.

25

That does happen. 


It's -- it's fairly


But -- but that does happen. 


28

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And, of course, in -- in Alabama, all


2

misdemeanors, except those that are initiated by


3

indictment, the first trial is in a -- a district or


4

municipal court where there's no jury trial.

5

trial, if there is a right to jury trial, comes only by a


6

-- an appeal and a de novo trial in the circuit court,


7

which is an administrative problem.

8

-- as a philosophical problem.

9

most misdemeanors are -- are being tried in courts where


And the jury


I don't see that as a


It's -- it's still the --


10

there is no jury, certainly all of them in the first


11

instance or most of them in the first instance. 


12

It seems that the petitioner's position


13

overlooks the fact that -- that the Sixth Amendment is --


14

is prophylactic rather than curative.

15

ideal is to prevent the convictions, not to do something


16

about them after they occur. 


17

Now, its -- its


Now, let me jump right quick to -- to the point


18

that Argersinger deals with it somewhat in that way. 


19

Argersinger is what we might call an outcome-based


20

analysis of whether there's a right to counsel.

21

and to that extent, maybe it's -- it's curative rather


22

than prophylactic. 


And --


23

But if -- if it is to be outcome-based analysis,


24

certainly it ought to be the -- the total outcome not just


25

the immediate outcome, and if a suspended sentence results


29

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in incarceration, when the probation is revoked, that


2

certainly is a part of the -- of the outcome that


3

Argersinger was -- was dealing that the trial judge is


4

required to make some decision on before trial even


5

begins.

6

So --

QUESTION:

Do you suppose it would be


7

constitutional for the State to offer the defendant at the


8

outset the promise of imposition of a suspended sentence


9

if counsel were waived? 


10

MR. MILLS:

If knowingly waived, I don't see a


11

constitutional problem with that.

12

happens in fact. 


13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MILLS:

And I'm sure that


Is that done sometimes in Alabama?

It -- it is.

It is done.

And, of


15

course, this is -- this is the distinction between the --


16

the pretrial diversion mechanism that was addressed


17

earlier and a trial.

18

pretrial diversions are by definition. 


19

QUESTION:

Most pretrial -- perhaps all


Well, put in its raw form, if the


20

judge said, now, if -- if you agree not to have a counsel,


21

I'll agree not to impose a jail sentence, that -- that


22

wouldn't be permitted.

23

MR. MILLS:

24

QUESTION:

25

I mean --

Yes, sir, and it seems if --


I assume.

Correct me if I'm wrong. 


I assume it wouldn't be permitted. 


30

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MILLS:

I think that's correct.

In fact, I


2

think that's what Argersinger requires.

3

Argersinger requires a trial judge to assure the defendant


4

who goes to trial without a lawyer that he's not going to


5

get jail sentence.

6

somewhere down the line, the judge has given him a false


7

assurance.

8
9

I think


And if he can receive a jail sentence


But --


QUESTION:

The -- the jail sentence would not be


for the original crime necessarily but perhaps just for


10

breaking probation.


11

MR. MILLS:

Well, I couldn't speak to all


12

jurisdictions, but certainly under Alabama law, there


13

would be no -- no way to impose a sentence for breaking


14

probation.

It would either be the original sentence --


QUESTION:

15

Well, that's what I mean.

But the


16

reason this -- the original sentence now becomes effective


17

is because he broke probation.

MR. MILLS:

18

This, of course, is correct.

This


19

is the -- the carrot and stick analogy which -- which


20

the --


21

QUESTION:

Well, maybe I misunderstood General


22

Pryor's argument, but I thought he was here arguing no, he


23

wouldn't impose the original sentence ever.

proceed on contempt, maximum 5 days.

25

MR. MILLS:

We'd just


Did I misunderstand?


I think that's what he -- he said. 


31

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm sure he -- he told us the whole story about contempt

under Alabama law.

3

be a separate violation, a separate contempt, and -- and


4

could warrant a -- an additional 5-day sentence.

5

contempt -- if a person was cited for violating his


6

probation because he quit his job --


7

QUESTION:

Each day that a contempt continues can


So,


Well, but that wouldn't -- that


8

wouldn't involve imposition of the original sentence. 


9

That's something else. 


10

MR. MILLS:

11

QUESTION:

That was what I understood --


12

MR. MILLS:

That would be something else.

13
14

That --


That


is -- that is for the contempt itself. 

QUESTION:

What is your position in the case of


15

the individual who refuses to pay the fine?

16

sentence of incarceration, simply a sentence of a fine,


17

and he refuses to pay it.

18

otherwise the same, he did not have counsel and he was not

offered counsel if indigent.

20

by a contempt sanction? 


21

MR. MILLS:

No suspended


Assuming the facts are

I think this Court has addressed


22

that issue that it constitutionally can, and I -- I assume


23

there's no -- no impediment to that under Alabama law.


24
25

QUESTION:

Well, does -- is there -- is there


some tension between the position you take about the


32

Alderson Reporting Company

1

inability of the State to enforce a -- a condition of

sentence or a condition of suspension in the position that


3

you take or acknowledge about the ability to enforce the


4

-- the sentence of fine?

5

different? 


6

MR. MILLS:

Why should the two cases be


Well, I think the -- the difference


7

is if the suspended sentence is imposed, a person is being


8

imprisoned because he committed a crime.

9

never --


10

QUESTION:

That would


And if the fine -- if the fine is


11

imposed, the fine is being imposed because the individual


12

committed a crime.

MR. MILLS:

13

Well, this is true, but only if he


14

willfully refuses to pay it where he has the ability to do


15

so.


16

QUESTION:

Well, is the -- is the difference


17

that you're making willful?

18

the conditions of suspension are not willful and refusals


19

to pay a fine are willful?


20

MR. MILLS:

That -- that violations of


Well, I believe willfulness --


21

willfully refusing to pay a fine would be a -- a


22

precondition to -- to a contempt sentence.


23

QUESTION:

All right.

24

we're talking about the class of -- of breach of -- of


25

conditions of suspension that are willful.

there's a condition of suspension that says you will be

I take it your position is that the suspended

MR. MILLS:

QUESTION:

Is that correct?


That -- that's --

But that's just as -- the willfulness


8

factor is the same in the refusal to abide by that


9

condition as it is in the refusal to pay the fine.

So,


10

I'm having difficulty seeing why you -- why on your view


11

the -- the two should come out differently. 


12

MR. MILLS:

Well, the -- the fine and the -- the


13

contempt for willfully refusing to comply with some other


14

conditions, I -- I could not distinguish those. 


15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MILLS:

No.

Of course, let me add one other


17

thing about the contempt process to -- to enforce.

Under


18

Alabama law, it wouldn't save the State any money.

It


19

would -- in fact, it would cost the State a lot of money


20

because of the formalities required in a criminal contempt


21

proceeding.

22

there probably would not have to be a jury trial, but


23

certainly there would have to be counsel if it is


24

anticipated that imprisonment will be one of the


25

punishments for willfully refusing.


There must be a separate proceeding.

I think

MR. MILLS:

Perhaps the -- the number of cases would not be as large

MR. DUKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the


Court:

Were this a petty offense prosecution, perhaps


6

the only legitimate, appropriate question would be the one


7

that has occupied the Court thus far this morning, but


8

this is a not a petty offense prosecution.

serious offense prosecution.

10
11

This is a


As such, it is a criminal


prosecution within the Sixth Amendment. 

The Sixth Amendment guarantees counsel

regardless of the sentence or sanction imposed.

QUESTION:

There are


One is textual; the other is


You're not saying it would guarantee


counsel if only a fine were imposed.

MR. DUKE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

The counsel


would be guaranteed in any serious offense prosecution.

QUESTION:

Well, how do you reconcile that with


Argersinger?

MR. DUKE:

Because Argersinger, Mr. Chief


22

Justice, was a petty offense case.

Argersinger explicitly


23

assumed that if it were a serious offense case, there


24

would be the right to counsel.

25

said there would be a right to counsel, but the lower


In fact, the lower court

court said he can't have a lawyer here because this was a


2

petty offense. 


3

QUESTION:

Well, but wasn't the basis on -- the


4

basis you're submitting now wasn't the basis on which the


5

Supreme Court of Alabama ruled, was it? 


6

MR. DUKE:

It -- it was not the -- the


7

rationale, but it -- it does support the result of the


8

Alabama Supreme Court's decision. 


9

QUESTION:

But I thought that the main issue


10

that we had here is the one we've been talking about, is


11

you have to give a person a lawyer when it is a petty


12

offense.

13

suspended sentence.

14

And the fact is that there's going to be a

So, what about that question? 


I mean -- and I -- I thought that Mr. Fried's


15

main point was don't do it because if you say you have to


16

give a person a lawyer, where it's a petty offense and the


17

only key thing is is a suspended sentence, I'll tell you


18

there are 1,800,000 people who have received probation in


19

petty offenses.

20

they violated probation, and that stick is like a


21

suspended sentence.

22

the probation violation; don't worry about it up front. 


23

That's -- that's what, I take it, is basically the


24

argument. 


25

And there must have been some stick if


So, deal with it when you worry about


And I've been waiting for you to talk because I

1

thought you might be a person who'd know the statistics. 


2

So, you might know if that's really so if -- or which


3

seems hard to get at how many of those $1.5 million


4

walking-around probation people did -- were never offered


5

a lawyer.

What's --


6

MR. DUKE:

We don't know. 


7

QUESTION:

We don't know.

8
9

So, what are we


supposed to do? 

MR. DUKE:

The -- the studies that I've seen


10

suggest that in misdemeanor -- petty misdemeanor cases,


11

frequently the -- the people are offered a lawyer in a --


12

in a group and it's suggested that most of them don't need


13

lawyers because they're not going to jail. 


14

But I submit, Justice Breyer, that the -- that


15

the real red herring in this case is treating this as a


16

petty offense.

This is not a petty --


17

QUESTION:

And it's not offense because? 


18

MR. DUKE:

Because the authorized sentence in


19

this case was 1 year, which made the jury trial right --


20

guaranteed him a right to a jury trial under the Sixth


21

Amendment, and because this was a criminal prosecution.


22

QUESTION:

But the question presented is this. 


23

In light of the actual imprisonment standard established


24

in Argersinger, refined in Scott, does the imposition of a


25

suspended or conditional sentence in a misdemeanor case


38

2

invoke a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel?

Now, I think what you're saying is that the


3

Supreme Court of Alabama decision could be supported on


4

another ground, but I'm not sure it -- it fits within the


5

question presented. 


6

MR. DUKE:

Well, I submit it does, Mr. Chief


7

Justice, because as I suggested, Argersinger dealt with a


8

petty offense.

9

imprisoning somebody, but the -- but the fundamental


Scott dealt with the question of


10

question here that -- that this Court should not allow


11

itself to get embroiled in it to repeat the mistake is to


12

treat this as if this is a trivial case because -- or to


13

put it this way, at some point someone has to ask the


14

question how is it that this defendant in this case had a


15

constitutional right to a jury trial under the Sixth


16

Amendment because this was a criminal prosecution, but he


17

did not have a right to assistance of counsel.


18
19
20

QUESTION:

Our -- our cases have reached


different results on those two issues.

MR. DUKE:

But, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the


21

Scott opinion, which you wrote, did not actually address


22

the serious offense 6-month distinction because the


23

parties were not addressing it.
