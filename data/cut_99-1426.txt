ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. WARREN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the court again.

11

delegation issue, other than to repeat and emphasize that

12

this agency wishes to regulate every nook and cranny of

13

this environment for air pollution reasons, and yet said

14

to the Court of Appeals, nothing in the statute requires

15

her to make any specific findings or to structure her

16

decision making in any particular way.

17

The -- I don't want to return to the

Now, with that said, I want to turn to the

18

statute.

And I want to start a little bit out of order

19

because in my first argument, I intended, I didn't get a

20

chance to respond to, Justice O'Connor's colloquy with

21

General Waxman.

22

Section 109(d) of the Act which requires the CASAC

23

committee to advise the administrator on any adverse

24

public health, welfare, social, economic and so forth

25

effects, and Mr. Waxman said two things that I want to

He said that's in a different

Secondly, the statute makes clear in the

6

judicial review provisions, and I'm looking at pages 6-A

7

and 7-A of my blue brief, that's the Petitioner's brief.

It says that the administrator must set forth a statement

QUESTION:

Whereabouts on page 6-A and 7-A are

you reading from?
MR. WARREN:

I'm now on page 7-A and I'm looking

13

at the judicial review provision which is Section

14

307(d)(3)(c).

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WARREN:

Where it starts the major legal -It's at the top of the -- yes, yes.

17

In other words, I'm reading about the statement that the

18

administrator must provide, which is the next sentence,

19

and it says it must set forth the pertinent findings,

20

recommendations and comments and so forth, and if her

21

proposal, and you'll notice it says Section 109(d), that's

22

7409(d) is all of Section 109(d), it's not excluding out

23

the parts that General Waxman would exclude out.

24

says is that she has to say where she differs with the

25

CASAC, and where she agrees with the CASAC, and so forth.

What it

1

So this information that Justice O'Connor, you referred to

2

in your question, is very much part of the standard

setting process.

4

administrator has to say when she promulgates a standard,

5

and it's very much part of the judicial review provision.

6

It's very much part of what the

Now, if I can return to the core provisions of

the statute.

Requisite to protect the public health with

8

an adequate margin of safety. Now, I'm going to talk

9

mostly about public health this morning, but that doesn't

10

mean that there aren't other words that you should pay

11

attention to, and other provisions in Section 108 and 109.

12

I just would like to focus on public health because I

13

think it's so doggone central.

14

Now, what does it mean to protect the public

15

health?

16

We all agree on that.

17

ordinary meaning under this Court's decisions.

18

Now, public health is not defined in the statute.

QUESTION:

It has to take on its natural and

Well, but the administrator surely

19

has some latitude in defining it since it isn't defined in

20

the statute.

21

MR. WARREN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I would

22

agree with that with this point in mind.

23

administrator defines public health so that it excludes

24

all countervailing factors, what you are doing is handing

25

over to the administrator a decision of far, far-reaching

If the

1

economic and political significance, and under this

2

Court's decisions, the MCI line of cases, the Court just

3

doesn't presume those kinds of delegations lightly, so my

4

point would be, of course, the administrator in this

5

provision and others has discretion, but it doesn't have

6

discretion --

7

QUESTION:

May I ask on your countervailing

8

factors, are you referring to countervailing health

9

factors, as well as countervailing economic factors?

10

MR. WARREN:

11

QUESTION:

12

I am indeed.
And do you interpret what she has

done is to exclude all countervailing health factors?

13

MR. WARREN:

Yes.

That's what the lead

14

industry's line of cases says, and really that's what the

15

Court of Appeals said too.

16

QUESTION:

You think lead industry holds that

17

they may not consider countervailing health factors, as

18

opposed to countervailing economic factors?

19

MR. WARREN:

The Court of Appeals in this case,

20

and this involves the protective effect and ground level

21

ozone, held that the statute required her to consider

22

that.

23

want to, what I'm saying about public health is --

24
25

But, but what I'm saying about public health, and I

QUESTION:

Does she acknowledge that, before you

go on?

MR. WARREN:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

She does.

Does she acknowledge that you have to

3

consider the effect of particulates in our ozone in

4

reducing ultraviolet rays, for example?

5

MR. WARREN:

Well, let's put it this way. She

6

didn't seek cert on that issue, so I think she, she has

7

acquiesced in that point.

9

QUESTION:

Well, then if that's so, maybe that

ends it because why isn't it a perfectly good, public

10

health must mean basically public health.

11

obtaining public health.

12

basically in the ordinary case, and then, of course, you

13

could have some unusual cases where in fact what people

14

like to say is we are going to go back to the stone age,

15

which was very unhealthy for people, so, that if in fact

16

the administrator has the authority, not necessarily the

17

requirement, to take into account the health effects of

18

either the, you know, we've seen the skin cancer referred

19

to a lot in the briefs, and I guess if you really

20

destroyed the economy, that would have adverse health

effects.

side agrees on that.

Basically.

Not the cost of

I don't know you're -- I don't know if the other

possibility that despite the technology forcing, etcetera,

you could hurt the public health, because we are going

back to the stone age.

QUESTION:

MR. WARREN:

I mean, if that kind of reading of

No.
No.

Why isn't it, however, a

7

correct reading, which isn't quite what they proposed, but

8

--

9

MR. WARREN:

Well, first of all, they've not

10

conceded the point that you're making but let me address

11

it in terms of public health.

12

attention to footnote 1 of our blue brief that I was

13

referring to again, because public health, as I think

14

everybody knows today, is a discipline which examines

15

health questions in terms of protecting the public with

16

explicit reliance on cost/benefit considerations.

17

this is the way you achieve the most for the public, and

18

that is by taking cost/benefit considerations into

19

account.

QUESTION:

I mean,

But the provision you just, you just

21

quoted to us at the beginning of your presentation here,

22

which says that the committee has to advise the

administrator of any adverse public health, welfare,

social, economic, or energy effects, which may result from

25

various strategies.

Let me say that I didn't make up this definition of public

And why did Congress --

QUESTION:

And you think this was relying on

this prestigious person at Yale, and not on the EPA?
MR. WARREN:

No what I really think it was

relying on was the implicit definition of public health in

20

the Act before 1970.

that which you see in the Unfunded Mandate Act.

we're talking about is a common sense weighing of

foreseen with the technology that doesn't yet exist. It

2

would be pretty hard to write that.

3

MR. WARREN:

Once again, with all due respect,

4

we have a very detailed regulatory impact analysis here

5

which does -- EPA knows a lot about the costs of

6

controlling these two pollutants because it's been

7

controlling them for 30 years, so it knows how much it's

8

going to cost to go that extra step and that extra step,

9

and there is an evaluation of those costs in the

10

regulatory impact analysis, so I don't think it's hard to

11

get a handle on those costs.

12

answer on the costs or the benefits is precise.

13

agency has a lot of discretion on that, but not to try, I

14

think is ultimately going to defeat public health.

15

going to defeat the objectives of trying to achieve more

16

good for the public, and that's what this statute's all

17

about.

don't know.

22

you would have on your scheme as a target for attack not

23

only the public health as it has been conceived as

24

something discrete from cost/benefit analysis, but what

25

kind of cost/benefit analysis this should be. Did EPA

adding something that will create another morass, many

more things that can be attacked than under the lead

industry's regime.

MR. WARREN:

It just seems to me that you are

Not at all, Justice Ginsburg. Not

at all.

What we are saying is that what the agency can't

do in the name of public health is take countervailing

factors off the table.

9

responsibilities to achieve the public health, those

But in carrying out its

10

factors are weighed on the pros and the cons, just as Ben

11

Franklin was talking about, and we have a process which is

-- which it can be subjected to executive branch review,

13

which is going to cut out a lot of the problems, to

congressional review.

mind. Now, let me also go forward and say that this is --

QUESTION:

It facilitates what Congress had in

17

you said this is not fancy cost/benefit analysis.

18

something -- well, what is it exactly?

MR. WARREN:

What it is, is what every other

20

health, safety and environmental agency does. We don't

21

have an executive order reviewing these decisions of EPA

22

and OSHA, and NHTSA, and so forth, because every statute

23

has been interpreted by a Court of Appeals the way this

24

one has.

25

balancing I'm talking about. Now, that's not to say that

The norm is to do the kind of weighing and

if a regulation passes executive branch review and gets by

2

congressional oversight, that there won't be judicial

3

review, but the agency is going to have a lot of

4

discretion with respect to the weight of the evidence

5

questions, questions about which costs can be quantified,

6

which costs can't be quantified, how to quantify them, how

7

to quantify the benefits.

8

questions which would come up in the -- in any subsequent

9

review or could come up in any subsequent review, but the

10
11

All those questions are

Agency's discretion is going to be honored.
QUESTION:

Mr. Warren, I must say that to the

12

extent you win this argument that you're making now, you

13

sort of weaken your argument on, concerning the ability of

14

EPA to issue revised ozone standards, because frankly,

15

what makes it eminently plausible that Congress might have

16

itself set a fixed table that can't be changed by EPA is

17

the scary idea that if EPA can issue revised standards,

18

God knows what it might issue.

19

into account anything but public health, and you know, it

20

could go down to transient costs, and if that's what the

21

scheme is, I can understand why Congress would say in Part

22

II, no, look it, with ozone, it affects everything, it

23

affects every industry.

24

import ourselves some cost/benefit analysis and we are

25

going to set this table, and EPA can't change it.

It doesn't have to take

1

Now, if you tell me that when EPA changes it,

2

EPA also has to take into account whether it's going to

3

bring us back to the stone age, then -- then it's a little

4

less plausible that Congress should have, should have

5

stepped in.

6

MR. WARREN:

I think there's a common theme

7

between these two portions of the argument.

8

part that I'm arguing, I will give it to EPA that it's

9

constrained by lead industry and this line of cases from

10

doing what I think is required by the statute to do, but

11

nonetheless it hasn't fought very hard to accomplish the

12

aims that I'm talking about.

13

general direction, it doesn't seem to want to follow it.

14

And then when Congress gives it very specific direction,

15

it doesn't want to follow it either, so that's what I

16

think -- that's the common theme here I think of an agency

17

that wants to do what it wants to do, and not what

18

Congress directed it to do.

19

the common --

20

QUESTION:

On the first

So when Congress gives it

I think that that's, that's

Does the agency have the authority --

21

you were saying what discretion they have.

discretion after they do this common-sense balancing of

whatever things.

24

have the discretion not to do it?

25

They have wide

2

QUESTION:

Not to take any of these things into

account.

3

MR. WARREN:

4

QUESTION:

No.

And that's exactly --

Well, supposing that the EPA

5

administrator thinks, you know, it's going to be a

6

three-week hearing just to begin, and by the time I get

7

finished reading all that stuff on the costs, etcetera,

8

it's going to be another year and I'll never get this job

9

done and I doubt that it has much to do with the outcome.

10

Is the EPA administrator then have the authority to say I

11

don't want to do it, I don't want to get into this?

12

MR. WARREN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WARREN:

No.
No.
Because the agency, what the agency

15

doesn't have discretion to do, it's got a lot of

16

discretion, and I have emphasized that these decisions are

17

going to be reviewed, you know, under the scheme I'm

18

talking about under the arbitrary and capricious test, but

19

the one thing it doesn't have discretion to do is to take

20

all those countervailing factors off the table because

21

what that is doing, and this feeds right back into the

22

they really help public health is not something Congress

What precisely are you talking about?

that both ozone and particulate matter have been regulated

very extensively for a number of years and take automobile

now, we are in the last 1 percent of control.

12

we've done this kind of regulation, but let me say that --

than the health balance, and if you are not talking about

that, lead industry seems to have worked.

course, we have the authority to reject the case, and

9

we're not bound by it.

10

MR. WARREN:

11

QUESTION:

Of

Right.

for 20 years in planning their courses of action.

that what the heart of stare decisus is.

16

MR. WARREN:

Isn't

Right, but let me -- I take the

17

Central Bank of Denver case as probably the best one to

18

talk about because this Court held no stare decisis effect

19

and overturned a decision where 11 courts of appeals had

20

come out the other way, and everybody had been living with

21

aider and abettor liability under 10(b)(5) of the '34

22

Securities Act for decades, and yet this court said that's

23

not what the statute said, so this Court is in a position

to read the statute and make sense of the statute, as I am

suggesting.

first decade of the statute, there wasn't much question

6

about that, that one of the reasons this thing didn't come

sharply into focus in lead industries is because we were

at the early stages and it made a lot of sense to do what

9

was being done.

10

That's not to say, and I'm not saying, although I

I have a pretty good sense then in the

But at this stage, I don't think health-health

tradeoffs really are the answer because for the very

12

reason you're suggesting, the costs are important because

the resources, and even in a rich society like this one,

we do have limited resources and those resources can be

better used elsewhere.

comparable degree of protection, even without any regard

to costs.

there are health-health tradeoffs so that there are ways

2

of drawing reasonable lines within the limited concepts of

3

health, pro-health, anti-health. If you introduce the

4

economic factors at this stage of the analysis, what you

5

will have done is to create a, or recognize, a new set of

6

reasons, but it doesn't follow from that that for purposes

7

of the delegation doctrine, it is impossible to draw a

line short of zero which is not arbitrary if you don't

consider the economics so that you complicate the

analysis.

You may complicate the analysis in what is, a

perfectly desirable way, but I don't see that it either

makes or breaks the constitutionality of the statute under

Mr. Waxman, do you concede that EPA

GENERAL WAXMAN:

The EPA -- we concede that the

13

EPA can consider countervailing health concerns that

14

derive from the presence of the pollutant in the air, for

not concede, and the Court of Appeals has unanimously

Yes, it can, in the following

respects.

First, if a state fails to create a SIP, a

state implementation plan, EPA must do it and in doing its

own implementation plan for one of the 3,000 areas in the

Yes.

You are telling me that yes -Yes.

They cannot -- EPA can --

I wasn't aware, I wasn't aware that

they could extend the time beyond, beyond what Congress

has prescribed.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

They can't.

Congress has

provided, for example, with respect to attainment of the

10

standard under a state implementation program that

11

attainment must be achieved within five years, but EPA can

12

extend it for another five years and then give two

13

additional one-year extensions, all by referencing

14

questions of costs, feasibility, etc. The EPA -- I want to

15

address the legislative history in a moment because the

16

history both before and after the 1970 acts is very

17

revealing here.

18

QUESTION:

Is the -- is the congressional scheme

19

for Congress to revisit this if it chooses, is that

20

necessary to save this from unlawful delegation?

21

GENERAL WAXMAN:

No.

I don't think so at all.

22

The first thing that Congress did after it passed the '70

23

act was to provide in 1977 that the standards should be

24

reviewed and revised every five years.

25

provision that is codified in Section 109(d).

Now, that is a

It's a new

1

provision, and it's significant because what it says is

2

that the revisions shall be made in the same manner as the

3

original standards are set, by reference to the criteria

4

documents and Section 109(b).

5

Now, I think that one of the things one can

6

glean, one of the many things one can glean from the

7

legislative history, is that when Congress did that in

8

1977, it knew repeatedly without any doubt and from a

9

commission that it itself asked to look at this question,

10

that the EPA was setting the standards without reference

11

to costs or other implementation factors, and yet, it

12

required the EPA to revise the standards every five years

13

and expressly said that they are to do so in the same

14

manner as which the original standards are set.

15

was, in particular, a 1970 Congressional Research Service

16

Report, 1975, Congressional Research Service Report that

17

was asked to look at this question, and outlined the

18

debate over whether to retain the effects of the

19

pollutants as the sole criteria of standard setting, and

20

Congress did that in 1977.

21

But it went further, Justice Kennedy.

There

It also

22

directed that another commission, an independent

23

commission, be established to look at this question, and

24

that commission reported to Congress in 1981, and it said,

25

"the current statutory criteria and requirements for

protect public health without considering economic factors

statute in 1990, that's exactly what it did.

5

House and the Senate reports accompanying the 1990

6

legislation said that primary NAAQS are "set at a level

7

8

safety without regard to the economic or technical

9

feasibility of attainment.

And when Congress revised the

Congress intended the administrator to be concerned about

16

said, and I am quoting, "when Congress has intended that

17

an agency engage in cost/benefit analysis, it has clearly

indicated such intent on the face of the statute."

And in the Benzene case, which my opponent has

Now there, this Court determined that before

one thing with respect to the previous argument, that

judgment has to be rendered and that the court will simply

QUESTION:

In fact, this Court went on at

So what happens if it turns out

11

because of science that the internal combustion engine

12

does always affect somebody and so that having cars will

13

have some adverse health effects, but what is the EPA

14

supposed to do?

15

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, the EPA reasonably

16

interprets the Clean Air Act as not either requiring or

17

permitting it to set levels that are at or below

18

background levels, and it has never yet, I mean, you know,

19

science inexorably creeps forward, but the EPA has never

20

set, found a level necessary, for example, to eliminate

21

the internal combustion engine.

22

ozone, the first time the EPA changed the standard, it

23

changed the standard from a .08 one-hour standard, which

24

is much stricter than what we have here, to a .12 one-hour

25

standard.

this goes to Justice Scalia's question from a while ago,

2

it relaxed it and of course the American Lung Association

3

and others came running in and saying that's ridiculous.

You know, how can you be relaxing the standard?

reasonableness to raise the standard.
Now, I want to say something about your, your

12

earlier question about what if the costs were so

13

astronomical to require us to deindustrialize, although

14

deindustrialization would be quite unhealthy, and was

15

quite unhealthy.

16

Congress has made a rational decision that with respect to

17

what it viewed and characterized as the most serious

18

problem facing America in 1970, which was air pollution,

19

that it wanted to create an agency, an expert agency that

would rely on science and the latest scientific knowledge

to do as step one, just tell us.

best judgment what level would be safe to set for the
