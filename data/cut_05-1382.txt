Federation of America.

General Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9
10
11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please the Court:
This case presents the same basic

12

constitutional question concerning the Federal

13

Partial-Birth Abortion Act as the first case.

14

course, the Ninth Circuit in the decision under review

15

here went much further in invalidating the Federal act.

16

If I could begin by talking about whether what we're

17

talking about here is medical necessity or just some

18

marginal effect on the risks.

19

fairly understand the argument that respondents are

20

making in this case, their argument has to be a matter

21

of simply marginal risks, because one illustration of

22

this, as I indicated in the first argument, if a doctor

23

really believes that a D&X procedure is the way to go in

24

a case then there's no ban on the procedure as such.

25

What the act bans is the infliction of the D&X procedure

Of

I think in order to

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on a living fetus.

2

So if a doctor really thinks the D&X

3

procedure is the way to go, he can induce fetal demise

4

at the outset of the procedure.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the problem with this

6

is that there -- well, some doctors absolutely agree.

7

mean, you know, my list over here, in which I have

8

hundreds of references from this thing, is doctor after

9

doctor who takes the other position, and they say:

I

10

Look, all that we're doing here is trying to remove the

11

fetus in a single pass.

12

anyway.

13

a single pass, and the reason we're trying to do that is

14

if we don't, there may be bone fragments left inside the

15

womb.

16

Every time you make another pass, it turns out there's

17

an added risk of scarring or hurting the inside of the

18

womb.

19

before, there is serious risks of introducing drugs into

20

the system.

21

serious problem of not trying to get the child out as

22

quickly as possible.

23

eclampsia, where you're in a situation where the woman

24

will be dead in five minutes or 10 minutes, there could

25

be such a situation.

It's not viable.

The fetus is going to die
We're trying to remove it in

There may be fetal parts left inside the womb.

If you try to induce demise through a drug

If the woman has uterine cancer, it's a

If you have preeclampsia or

The doctor thinks only one thing:
4


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Get it out as fast as possible.

2

All right.

Now, I know there are doctors who think the

3

contrary.

4

think roughly along the lines I've taken.

5

in Stenberg as well.

6

you don't have support -- you do -- but that the support

7

is contraverted, and therefore, what do we do in that

8

case?

9

There's lots of testimony of the doctors who
That was true

So I think the issue is not that

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Breyer, let

10

me take as a point of departure the specific risks that

11

you associated with the injection that induces fetal

12

demise, because if there isn't a significant risk to

13

that injection, then all the other benefits that are

14

associated with the D&X procedure don't matter because

15

they can perform the D&X procedure.

16

through the record on this point, I think you will not

17

find any testimony that supports a significant risk from

18

that injection.

19

risks from any medical procedure, but the risks are not

20

significant.

21

Now if you look

Yes, there are risks because there are

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there a definition in

22

the law of significant risk, other than doctors saying,

23

I've been trained to try to save life and I want to

24

perform the safest possible way?

25

definition of what's a small risk, a big risk, a giant

Is there some legal

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

risk?

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With all respect, I think

3

if a single injection that doesn't take any particular

4

risk other than the fact that it's an injection, if that

5

counts as a significant risk, then we might as well

6

strike the word "significant" from the discussion in

7

Stenberg.

8

very clear that their position is one of zero tolerance

9

for any marginal risk to maternal health.

10

And Then I think what you have is that it's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, my question is the

11

same as Justice Breyer's.

12

literature, including medical literature, that talks

13

about significant or minor risks?

14

forms when you go to the dentist about risks.

15

if -- if the chance of death is one out of 100, is that

16

significant?

17

Is there anything in the

I mean, you fill out
Now,

I mean, I don't know.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, it's a very

18

difficult question to evaluate in the abstract, Justice

19

Kennedy.

20

though, has direct bearing on this case, because

21

Congress after all found that there was some risks with

22

the D&X procedure.

23

point to is the risk of cervical incompetence because

24

the D&X procedure does -- it does require additional

25

dilation, which can be associated with risks of losing

And I think it actually, that question,

The most prominent one that I would

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

future pregnancies.

2

at a level of statistical significance, in the Chasen

3

study by a plaintiff practitioner, where 2 of the 17

4

women who had the D&X procedure and were available for

5

follow-up care had an early pre-term pregnancy in the

6

follow-up.

7

And that was born out, although not

So I think those risks are born out in the

8

only study that's available.

And I think the question

9

becomes, now, if D&X were some life-saving procedure for

10

something that there was no other known cure for, you

11

might think, well, those are the risks you run.

12

when there remains available the D&E procedure, which

13

has been well tested and works every single time as a

14

way to terminate the pregnancy, then I think risks that,

15

if you were talking about a life-saving treatment for

16

some life-threatening condition with no known cure,

17

those risks might not be significant in that context.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

Well, but there is a risk

19

if the uterine wall is compromised by cancer or some

20

forms of preeclampsia and it's very thin, there's a risk

21

of being punctured.

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

There is a risk, Justice

23

Kennedy, but I think that, first of all, that even in

24

those limited circumstances, that the marginal risk

25

between the D&X procedure and the D&E procedure are
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

really as far as I can tell nonexistent.

Even in that

2

condition, unless there's some reason not to put the

3

injection in, if the doctor really thought the D&X

4

procedure was the way to go, he could begin, as

5

Dr. Carhart does in every single case after the 17th

6

week and start off with a digoxin injection or potassium

7

chloride injection, induce fetal demise, and he has

8

nothing to worry about from this statute.

9

And I think the very fact that they are

10

attributing significant risks to a single injection

11

shows that at bottom their position is a zero tolerance

12

position.

13

but it's completely inconsistent with this Court's

14

precedence, most notably the Casey decision.

15

all you needed to do is point to some marginal risk,

16

then this Court should have struck down the 24-hour

17

waiting period in the Casey decision, because the

18

plaintiffs there said the 24-hour waiting condition has

19

imposed significant risks.

20

point by an amicus brief by ACOG.

21

say, well, you know, you're right, there's marginal

22

risks, we're going to apply a zero tolerance rule.

23

And that's a legitimate position, I suppose,

Because if

They were backed in that
But this Court didn't

This Court instead upheld the 24-hour

24

period, even though it required overruling Akron I's

25

contrary decision and this Court pointed, of course, to
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Akron I as an exemplar of the pre-Casey decisions that

2

put too little weight on the legitimate countervailing

3

interest that the government has in this area.

4

And so with respect, I think that the

5

argument they are making is effectively an argument for

6

returning to Akron I and Thornburgh, where the rule of

7

law was that there would be no interference between a

8

doctor and the doctor's patient and the doctor's best

9

judgment as to how to treat the patient.

This Court of

10

course consciously moved away from that in Casey and

11

expressly repudiated the language in Akron I and

12

Thornburgh to that effect.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I follow up on a

14

question the Chief Justice asked you during the last

15

argument?

16

the statute to narrow it to intentional situations.

17

Would you explain a little more exactly what situations

18

you would exclude and what you would include in your

19

interpretation of the statute?

20

We got into the government's construction of

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, justice Stevens, let

21

me answer it this way and maybe if you want me to take

22

you specifically to the text, I can do that.

23

think the bottom line would be that under our view of

24

the statute, the most important thing is for those

25

doctors, like Dr. Cranen or Dr. Vivicar, who try to do
9

Alderson Reporting Company

But I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the D&E procedure every time, and they succeed 99 or 100

2

percent of the time.

3

cases where they inadvertently deliver the fetus past

4

the anatomical landmark, we would say they are not

5

covered by the statute because they would not satisfy

6

what is really a compound mens rea requirement in the

7

statute, which requires that the delivery of the fetus

8

be intentional and deliberate and for the purpose of

9

committing the overt act of killing fetus.

Well, in the 1 percent of the

And in those

10

cases, of course, the intent of the doctor performing

11

the D&E isn't to deliver the fetus at all; it's to

12

deliver a fetal arm or a fetal leg as part of the

13

dismemberment procedure.

14

by the mens rea requirement of the statute.

15

So they would not be covered

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would you measure the mens

16

rea at the outset of the procedure when they begin the

17

dilation a day or two before the actual operation is

18

performed, or is it at the time of beginning the

19

operation?

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think you could measure

21

it from either time point.

I think the better view is

22

actually that it would be measured from the beginning of

23

the surgical operation, though the evidence of their

24

intent at the beginning of the dilation would be very,

25

very relevant.

The reason I would say that is I think
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if somebody tries to dilate and then gets an extreme

2

amount of dilation at the point they start the

3

procedure, I think the intent of Congress would still be

4

for them to do a dismemberment procedure at that point,

5

rather than an intact removal.

6

But if this Court thought that the

7

constitutional line mattered on the answer to that, then

8

you could start from the beginning of the dilation

9

because I think in fairness the differences between the

10

two procedures are probably most manifest in the

11

dilation regimen.

12

supports the notion that there are differences even once

13

you begin the procedure as to how you manipulate the

14

fetus.

15

do the intact removal, says that after he has one leg

16

removed he effectively tries to reach back up and swing

17

the second leg across so he can remove the entire fetal

18

body.

19

dismemberment D&E you're not trying to swing the second

20

leg across; you're simply continuing to pull or twist on

21

the first extremity that prevents itself.

22

I also think, though, the record

I mean, Dr. Chasen for example, who is trying to

If you're -- obviously if you're performing a

So I think there are differences even at the

23

procedural level.

So I think that it would probably be

24

most consistent with Congress's intent to measure it

25

from the beginning of the surgical part of the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

procedure.

2

statute, I think it's amenable to the contrary

3

interpretatio.

4

But if you, as I say, in order to save the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think you're wrong about

5

-- you're probably wrong about this.

But just before

6

you leave, I mean, this is why it's so hard for me to

7

get into the medical procedure.

8

perhaps wrongly, that well, the doctor can always use a

9

lethal injection to kill the fetus.

I heard you as saying,

All right?

That

10

rang a bell.

11

said about that and what they said is that nearly

12

everyone agrees it is not always possible to kill the

13

fetus by injection.

14
15
16
17
18
19
20

So I look up and see what the lower courts

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Oh, but can I respond to

that specifically?
JUSTICE BREYER:

He says It is not always

possible -- what?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Can I respond to that

specifically?
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, he then goes; he

21

tells you why.

He says there is a Dr. Knorr who says

22

you can't do it when the woman has a prior surgery,

23

pelvic inflammatory disease.

24

they are not considered appropriate candidates because

25

of medical illness or cardiovascular disease, etcetera.

And then another one says

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So there's a list of medical situations where they

2

couldn't use a fetal injection.

3
4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Breyer, if I could

respond to that.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Yes.
I mean, there are certain

7

situations where the injection is contraindicated.

8

think they'd be relatively rare situations.

9

think, you know, you could imagine I suppose that the

And I

10

statute might pose a problem if you could identify

11

particular conditions where a D&X was particularly

12

useful, and those were also situations where an

13

injection would be contraindicated.

14

the universe of that may be zero, it may be one in a

15

million; I don't know, but it's very small.

16

I

I think, you know,

Another point that's made in the record

17

which I think is important is they suggest well, you

18

know, maybe, maybe if you can't do the injection into

19

the heart of the fetus, then you're only going to be

20

successful something like 92 percent of the times.

21

think though for purposes of the mens rea requirement

22

would certainly take care of any concern that the

23

physician would have -

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I

It's bothering me, why I'm

using this as an illustration is that there are so many
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of these things.

2

are only talking about a few, rare special cases.

3

as soon as you tell me that what's supposed to happen is

4

that the judges are supposed to start deciding whether

5

this is one of these unusual cases or not, rather than

6

relying upon significant medical opinion, as this doctor

7

is now illustrating, I don't see how it's going to work.

8

At least I don't see how it's going to work without some

9

people suffering serious illness as a result of mistakes

10
11

Of course there are special cases.

We

And

by the judge.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Breyer, I wish we

12

were talking about just a few rare cases because I think

13

if we were, there would be, the statute would be

14

amenable to not being applied in those rare cases.

15

this is one thing that I think my colleagues on the

16

other side of the podium will agree with me on, is that

17

their doctors don't think that this is a safer procedure

18

in rare cases.

24
25

But

They think it's a safer procedure every
And that's why doctors like Dr. Chasen and

In their best

And it's just a question ultimately of
whether you're going to defer to individual doctors'

judgments, even when it's very much of a minority

judgment; I mean anything you want to say about this

procedure it is the heterodox procedure, not the

orthodoxy.

5

procedure, not the D&X procedure.

6

case three of the four plaintiffs don't try to do the

7

intact removal, so I think that just gives you, just a,

8

know you, anecdotal observation that you are talking

9

about the rare procedure, the heterodox procedure.

10

And so the question is when you have a

Most ob-gyns are going to do the D&E

12

who like to do is it a different way, can Congress

15

judgment or do the doctors get

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the doctor has the

16

intent, the good faith intent to perform a standard in

17

utero D&E, and he knows because of what's happened in

18

the last three months, with women with this particular

19

shaped fetus and particular position of the fetus, that

20

the chances are 50 percent, 60 percent that it's going

21

to be an intact delivery, at which point he is presented

22

with the problem.

23

Does he have the prohibitive intent?

24

Because aren't you, don't you have an intent to commit

25

the, most likely consequences of your acts?
15
Alderson Reporting Company

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think so.

I mean

2

that might be a situation -- I don't know that that's a

3

realistic hypothetical, I mean, let me just say that.

4

If that turned out to be a realistic hypothetical, that

5

might be an example of where this question I talked

6

about with Justice Stevens might matter.

7

that case it might matter whether or not the intent was

8

measured -

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Which is in

Well, that's important to

10

me because you seem to think that there is a standard

11

D&E.

12

that D&Es ought to result in result in intact deliveries

13

quite without the intent of the doctor.

14

that's wrong.

15

In reading the medical testimony it seemed to me

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Now maybe

With respect, Justice

16

Kennedy, I don't think that's born out in this record,

17

it's the other way, which is doctors who want to perform

18

a D&X, often, in a majority of the cases end up

19

performing a D&E.

20

perform a D&E, in Dr. Vibhakar's case she says a hundred

21

percent of the time, she ends up with dismemberment.

22

Dr. Creinen says it's 99% of the time that he ends up

23

with dismemberment.

24
25

But the doctors that set out to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I gather your

submission is that we can tell who is setting out to

2

record references that you gave earlier?

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Yes.

Those were the

And you can, you

4

can, you can tell you can tell from the fact that a

5

doctor, like one of the plaintiffs in the Nebraska case,

6

Dr. Fitzhugh, says, that, well, I don't do the intact

7

removal because if I wanted to do that I would have to

8

do a second round of dilation with a second round of

9

laminarias.

And of course, that second round of

10

laminaria is also a medical procedure.

11

injection, every medical procedure has some risks, risks

12

of infection.

13

this is at 174 A to 177 A in the Eighth Circuit petition

14

appendix, he says that he doesn't like to do a second

15

round of laminaria dilation because it's painful to the

16

patient.

17

Like the

If you looked at Dr. Creinen's testimony,

And that's his testimony.
So there are countervailing indications

18

here.

And as I say, this idea of trying to prohibit a

19

practice that involves further dilation is not an

20

irrelevant concern from a health standpoint, because one

21

of the things that Congress heard was that there were

22

risks to future pregnancies from cervical incompetence.

23

And that's a particularly important concern because

24

first of all, the plaintiff's experts aren't in a very

25

good position to evaluate that risk because they provide
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

abortion services, not follow-up services.

2

not in a good position to judge that risk.

3

So they're

Second of all, the only study we have here

4

points out that there is a greater incidence of that

5

preterm delivery in the group that had a D&X procedure.

Now again they say, they are going to come up and say

7

well it's not statistically significant.

8

numbers I think are striking.

But the

a commonsense manner, if you know that you were going to

13

be in a room with 17 people where two people were going

14

to have something bad happen to them, or in a room with

15

45 and two -- bad things were going to happen to two, I

16

know which room I'd like to be in.

18

The D&E group was much larger, 45,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now I think as

And all I'm pointing

Yes, once you're making a

19

point of that study, I think it was also the case that

the ones that had the intact were older or rather

21

further along in pregnancy; isn't that true?

risks were greater, the other side says that this

actually shows it was safer.

to evaluate that.

5

I mean, I don't know how

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think it's even more

6

complicated than that, Justice Breyer, because in fact,

7

you're right that the D&X patients were at a further

8

gestational age, but the D&E patients were actually

9

older.

And so I think -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I missed that.
Right.

But it happens

12

that, the D&E patients were on average two years older,

13

which I think also would be associated with greater

14

risk.

16

thing, this is a study put together by one of the

17

plaintiff practitioners, a plaintiff in the Southern

18

District case, based on a study of his own practice.

19

And of course one of the intuitions about the D&X

20

procedure is because you remove it intact it's going to

21

be a faster procedure and there is going to be less

22

blood loss.

So I think it's a wash.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

GENERAL CLEMENT:

25

when he studied that?

But I still think the
For one

two procedures.

2

I'm sorry.

JUSTICE GINSBERG:

Because your time is

3

running out I did want to ask you about a feature of

4

this legislation that hasn't come up so far, and that is

5

perhaps stimulated by Stenberg.

6

regulation on access to abortion has been state

7

regulation and this measure is saying to the states,

8

like it or not, the Federal Government is going to ban a

9

particular practice and we are going to take away the

10

choice from the states, in an area where up until now

11

it's, it's been open to the states to make those

12

decisions.

13

is something new.

14

But up until now, all

How should that weigh in this case?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And it

Well, I mean I don't think

15

it should figure in this Court's decision.

16

principally because the other side in neither case makes

17

a challenge based on the Commerce Clause, and I suppose

18

there is two reasons for that.

19

they don't bring the challenge is because there is a

20

jurisdictional element that I think would address the

21

challenges as a doctrinal matter.

22

I think is because this isn't the only instance in which

23

the Federal Government has gotten involved to address

24

issues related to the abortion context.

25

JUSTICE GINSBERG:

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It seems rather odd for

true that abortion has been dealt with at a Federal

11

level one way or another since 1973.

12

also part of the backdrop, but I also think, I mean, you

13

know, the Federal Government gets involved in this

issue, you know, depending on your perspective, for good

15

or for harm.

It's there to protect access to the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Clement, That

18

brings up a question I was intending to ask you.

19

notice the finding says nothing about interstate

20

commerce but the statute says any physician who in or

21

affecting interstate commerce performs the procedures.

22

Does that mean that the procedure is performed in a free

23

clinic, as opposed to a profit organization, it would

24

not be covered?

25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I

Justice Stevens, I don't

a definitive position on that.

not a jurisdictional element in the face statute.

there may be differences as, in application.

I think it could be

GENERAL CLEMENT:

So

But how could the Commerce

10

There's

I don't

Well, I think by, I mean,

11

you know, the Court's precedents in other areas has

12

suggested it's just not a matter of whether the ultimate

13

service is provided in commerce but in order to get the

14

22

question one way or another.

23

If it

But I don't think the constitutionality

I think in regards to the Chasen study the

24

last thing I would say about it though is that it's

25

important because most of the arguments on the other
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

side are intuitive arguments.

They are intuitive

2

arguments, that they would be less passive, so that will

3

be more safe.

4

same intuition would lead to the notion that it would be

5

quicker and there will be less blood loss.

6

that was actually tested in a controlled study, it

7

turned out not to be the case.

And what I think is telling is that the

And when

8

The last thing I'll say about the Chasen

9

study is there was this indication that the two most

10

serious complications were associated with the D&E

11

procedure.

12

understand about the Chasen study is it is a

13

retrospective study of Dr. Chasen and his partner's own

14

practice.

15

out to perform a D&X procedure, and so what they are

16

studying and what they call the D&X procedures, that

17

cohort are the times when they tried to do a D&X

18

procedure and they were successful.

19

But one thing that I think is important to

Now what they do in every case is they set

The D&X cohort from this study, is you know,

20

are those circumstances where he and his partner tried

21

to do a D&X procedure, weren't successful and did a D&E

22

procedure.

23

Now why is that significant?

Because it

24

shows as Chasen noted in his article that in those

25

situations that were D&Es and they were associated with
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

serious complications there was nothing he could have

2

done about it.

3

to perform a D&X and it wasn't successful, so he ended

4

up performing a D&E.

5

the Chasen study ends up supporting our position,

6

because the first time you have any kind of controlled

7

study what you find is that some of the intuition turns

8

out not to be true, and the safety benefits from these

9

are a wash, and the one sort of loose end from the study

10

is the threat that you do see from the greater dilation.

11

Now it's not statistically robust, but I think that it

12

does bear out one of Congress's concerns.

13

He could have performed a D&X, he tried

And so I really think on balance

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could you address the

14

question I asked respondent's counsel in the last case

15

about the availability of other facilities?

16

there are alternate methods but some of these require

17

hospitalization, and my understanding is the hospitals

18

aren't always open.

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because

Right, I -- I So it doesn't make much

21

sense to say well, there is an alternate procedure if

22

you can't be admitted to the facility.

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Sure.

And as I tried to

24

indicate in rebuttal, that's really not a concern

25

because, the difference is whether some clinics will
24
Alderson Reporting Company

only offer the D&X and the D&E and will say that

2

basically you've got to go to a hospital to get the

3

induction procedure.

4

think matter, because the point is anybody could can got

5

a D&X who is at a clinic can also get a D&E.

6

single case the doctor that can perform the D&X can also

offer the D&E.

standard of Casey, I think every woman in every case is

But that doesn't really, I don't

In every

And since the D&E is what the district

going to have that option of a safe, of a safe pregnancy

11

option.

12

And again one way to illustrate that is Chasen.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then you pin your

13

whole case on the availability of D&E even though D&Es

14

sometimes inadvertently turn into intact D&Es.

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, but, Justice

16

Kennedy, I think we have our answer to that, which is

17

the best reading of the statute requires the intent at

18

the outset of the procedure, and therefore nobody -- in

19

the 99 percent of the cases that Dr. Crainer sets out to

20

performs a D&E and succeeds, there's no issue in the

21

world because everybody would look at that and say

22

that's a D&E.

23

In the one case -

JUSTICE BREYER:

How do you do that, because

24

I looked at that part of the statute and, comparing it

25

with the statute in Cathcart, the relevant part forbid a
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doctor from doing this for the purpose of performing an

2

abortion that the doctor knows will kill the fetus.

3

That's the language basically, right.

4

it says you can't deliver past the fetal trunk for the

5

purpose of performing an overt act that the doctor knows

6

will kill the fetus.

7

words.

8

don't see the difference.

9
10

And in this one

So I look at those two sets of

I mean, I've simplified them slightly, but I

So if the one in Cathcart is viewed as too
vague, why is the other one here not too vague?

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Breyer, it's

12

because of the addition of the anatomical landmark

13

language to the Federal statute.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I'll grant you that

15

in respect -- if what Cathcart was worried about I guess

16

was you didn't know what the words "significant

17

substantial portion of the child," that tends to be

18

cured.

19

fact that a doctor who sets out to perform a D&E will,

20

making a pass, think he'll have the fetus dismembered

21

and, lo and behold, it doesn't dismember, so the bottom

22

portion of the fetus descends outside the womb.

23

there he is and now what happens?

24

concern, then I guess you'd agree that that same concern

25

exists here.

But if what Cathcart was worried about was the

And

If that's the

26
Alderson Reporting Company

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, only with the

2

caveat, though, is that I think this Court really didn't

3

have to confront the second concern because it had the

4

first concern.

5

this Court did, was a substantial portion, and that was

6

the, that was the act that induced fetal demise, either

7

way it was covered no matter what your purpose was,

8

because the doctor's purpose in removing the leg was to

9

induce fetal demise.

10

And if you thought that a leg, which

Here the compound mens rea requirement works

11

with the anatomical landmark language, so that what you

12

need to satisfy the statute is the deliberate and

13

purposeful intent to remove the fetus past the navel

14

with the purpose of performing an overt act that will,

15

will lead to fetal demise, which is not covered when you

16

don't even have the intent to take it out of the -- past

17

the anatomical landmark in the first place and you're

18

trying to do something that's going to take place in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVE C. GARTNER
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

2
3

MS. GARTNER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

4

In Casey, this Court reaffirmed that the

5

government cannot ban pre-viability abortions.

Despite

6

Casey, Stenberg suggested that there is a narrow

7

category of pre-viability abortions, intact D&Es, as

8

this Court understood that term in Stenberg, that can be

9

banned so long as the ban contains a health exception.

10

But I'd like to leave the health exception question

11

aside for a minute and turn to the scope of the law that

12

Congress has enacted here.

13

The question is whether Congress can enact a

14

pre-viability abortion ban that does not track the

15

hallmark of intact D&E abortions as this Court

16

understood that term in Stenberg and by doing so to ban

17

a substantially greater array of abortions than would be

18

banned had the law faithfully tracked the language in

19

the Stenberg opinions about what constitutes an intact

20

D&E.

21

Stenberg and in the dissents.

22

And I'm referring both to the majority opinion in

It is our position that this Court must

23

reject Congress's effort to exploit the limited license

24

that this Court seemingly granted in Stenberg because to

25

allow such an expansion of pre- viability abortions that
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can be banned would set the stage for continued

2

legislative efforts to ban other iterations of the

3

classic D&E method of abortion until truly there would

4

be nothing left at all of Casey's holding that it is

5

unconstitutional to ban pre- viability second trimester

6

abortions.

7

The government in this case has conceded

8

that the act bans more abortions than merely the intact

9

D&E as this Court understood it in Stenberg.

But I want

10

to highlight for the Court how the language of this act

11

departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E and how these

12

departures place doctors at risk of prosecution for the

13

very facet of D&E abortions, and by that I mean all D&E

14

abortions, that enhance their safety.

15

There is three respects in which the act

16

departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E as understood

17

in Stenberg.

18

extraction of an intact fetus to the head, one of the

19

primary hallmarks that this Court understood in

20

Stenberg.

21

extracted past the navel, a far more frequent occurrence

22

than extraction to the head.

23

in its briefing both in their initial brief and in their

24

reply concedes that in any of what the government calls

25

standard D&Es a living fetus can be extracted past the

First, the act does not require breach

Instead, the act applies once the fetus is

And in fact the government

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fetal navel before demise occurs.

2

In addition, the act does not require the

3

fetus to be delivered intact at the end of the

4

procedure, another component of what is considered to be

5

a hallmark of intact D&E in Stenberg.

6

In fact, the word intact appears nowhere in

7

the statute and again the government concedes that some

8

non-intact D&Es would violate this law as drafted.

9

fact, the government contends that one of the

In

10

"advantages," in its words, is that the law would ban

11

more than intact D&E.

12

require that the fetus be extracted in a breach

13

presentation at all, even though in Stenberg the Court

14

thought of the breach extraction as one of the hallmarks

15

of intact D&E.

And finally, the act does not

20

21

How often does the vertex delivery occur in a
I -

MS. GARTNER:

Your Honor, two, two doctors

22

in particular, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Hammond, testified

23

that they have used in their practice the vertex

24

presentation to treat women who, as Ms. Smith indicated,

25

the fetus suffered from a serious lethal anomaly that
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

involved a greatly distended abdomen.

2

presented in a head-first presentation.

3

delivered through the dilated cervix, but the only way

4

to complete the procedure was to reduce the size of the,

5

of the abdomen that was, that was anomalous in size

6

because of the underlying fetal condition.

7

The fetus
The head

In those cases, those doctors testified that

8

that was absolutely the safest way to terminate the

9

pregnancy for the woman.

The only alternative way would

10

have been abdominal surgery, which, which all the,

11

virtually all of the doctors, even the government's

12

doctors, agreed carries far greater risks for the woman

13

than a vaginal surgical abortion.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Miss Gartner, with regard

15

to your argument that the statute here did not track

16

what you have described as the characteristics, the

17

hallmarks, I think the answer from the other side is

18

that the, the theory of this statute is a theory of a

19

clear line between a legitimate abortion and

20

infanticide.

21

it's a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery is

22

irrelevant.

23

And if that is the theory, then whether

What would your answer be to that?
MS. GARTNER:

Well, two answers, Your Honor.

24

First of all, the clear line that this Court drew in

25

Stenberg was essentially the line at intact delivery to
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the head followed by an act that results in fetal

2

demise.

3

Stenberg could -- was, was an intact D&E and several

4

members of the court suggested that that would be

5

constitutional to ban.

6
7
8
9

Very clearly what this Court understood in

In addition, the government today seems to
suggest JUSTICE SOUTER:
would be an appropriate line.

Well, we said that that
But the question here is

10

is it really essential to an appropriate line that we

11

talk, that we describe it as a, as a breach delivery or

12

a non-breach delivery.

13

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, I would agree that

14

of the three hallmarks that the Court recognized in

15

Stenberg, the breach delivery is probably the least, the

16

least central; that the other two hallmarks, the

17

extraction to the head followed by a completely intact

18

delivery after demise, were absolutely the hallmarks

19

that everyone on this Court understood in Stenberg, and

20

those, those lines, are nowhere in the statute that

21

Congress enacted.

22

Today General Clement seems to be arguing

23

that there is a different line that's protected in this

24

statute, a different line than the Court recognized in

25

Stenberg, and the line is about where the fetus is when
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

demise occurs.

But, but this Court in Stenberg

2

understood that even in a classical D&E, a standard D&E,

3

as the government calls it, part of the fetus is outside

4

the woman's uterus when fetal demise occurs.

5

recognized that fetal demise occurs even in a standard

6

D&E when, after a part of the fetus is drawn out of the

7

women's uterus, resistance is met, disarticulation

8

occurs, and after that fetal demise.

9

standard D&E the line that the government today is

The Court

So even in a

10

offering up, the line of inside or outside the uterus,

11

would be violated in any D&E -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understood the

13

statute here to apply only when the, in the words of the

14

statute, that the partially delivered infant is killed

15

after passing the anatomical landmark.

16
17

MS. GARTNER:

Well, that's right, Your

Honor.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So we just say your

19

hypothetical about extraction of the leg it seems to be

20

would not be covered by the statute.

21

MS. GARTNER:

Absolutely, Your Honor, that's

22

right.

23

fetus, no matter what, is outside the women's uterus,

24

whether it's an intact D&E, a non-intact D&E -

25

But what I'm saying is that some part of the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we don't talk about a

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

leg dying.

2

I think that's not the leg.

3

We talk about the fetus dying, I think, and

MS. GARTNER:

I think the important point is

4

that the government acknowledges that in a standard D&E,

5

what it calls standard D&Es, the fetus can be extracted

6

past the anatomical landmark.

7

landmark isn't a bright-line decision between intact

8

D&Es and non-intact D&Es.

9

drew that line between intact D&Es and non-intact D&Es.

10

So the anatomical

But in Stenberg this Court

It suggested -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where does the

12

government concede that in a standard D&E the living

13

fetus is extracted past the anatomical landmark?

14

MS. GARTNER:

It does so -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought that was

16

-- I thought their position was that that was not the

17

standard D&E.

18

MS. GARTNER:

Right.

It does so in two

19

places, Your Honor.

On page 32 of their initial brief

20

they refer to, they describe two circumstances that they

21

say or two parts of the law that they say saved the law

22

from banning non- intact D&Es.

23

anatomical landmark and the second is the requirement of

24

an overt act.

25

non-intact D&Es that were not already excluded from the

The first is the

They describe the overt act as saving

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

anatomical landmark requirement.

2

there are some standard D&Es that would not be saved by

3

the anatomical landmark requirement.

4

So that suggests that

In addition, in their reply brief on page 22

5

they explicitly say that the fetus is usually not

6

delivered past the anatomic landmark in the standard

7

D&E, but they don't say that that never occurs.

8

do admit that that sometimes is the case, and in fact

9

the government witness, doctor -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So they

I thought their

11

answer on that was that sometimes the D&E procedure will

12

lead to a D&X procedure, but that the requirement of

13

deliberately and intentionally removes those situations

14

from the scope of the statute.

15

MS. GARTNER:

Well, I think that's not how I

16

understood it, Your Honor.

But in addition, the

17

government witnesses, witness, Dr. Sadigian, admitted

18

that in any standard D&E the fetus can be extracted past

19

the navel, the anatomic landmark of the navel, of the

20

naval, even in a standard.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MS. GARTNER:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Prior to demise?

That's right, Your Honor.
Did you understand the

24

government's argument or answer to that to be, well, if

25

the intent did not exist, if there was not an intent to
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

do that, then the doctor is not liable?

2

MS. GARTNER:

Well, Your Honor, I think this

3

gets to the point I was going to make about the safety

4

of doing abortions in a way that would be banned by the

5

law, and that's that in every D&E, regardless of whether

6

the intent is to do an intact D&E or not an intact D&E,

7

the intent is to minimize the insertion of instruments

8

into the uterus and to extract the fetus as intact as

9

possible, because each insertion of the instruments

10

increases the risk of causing harm to the woman's

11

uterus.

12

physician expects to have an intact fetus at the very

13

end of the procedure, they do want to minimize the -

14

the amount of instrumentation and bring it out in as few

15

parts as possible and so there is a deliberate and

16

if this law stands with the past the navel line the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My concern with your

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about the

2

Solicitor General's reference with respect to the

3

differing protocols on dilation which suggests a

4

different intent going into the procedure for the D&E

5

and D&X?

6

MS. GARTNER:

Well, two points, Your Honor.

7

One is the statute makes no mention of dilation

8

protocols even though some group like the American

9

College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists when they

10

intend to define an intact D&E abortion they've defined

11

it specifically by reference to dilation protocols.

12

some state statutes have also used dilation protocols as

13

part of the definition of intact D&E but this statute

14

makes no mention of dilation protocols.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

No, but the dilation

16

protocol certainly would be relevant on the question of

17

intent which this statute does refer to, wouldn't it?

18

MS. GARTNER:

I think it would be relevant,

19

Your Honor, but I think it's not -- it really can't be

20

dispositive of the physician's intent be -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MS. GARTNER:

Because?

Some doctors use a one day

23

protocol, some doctors use a two day protocol but that

24

in of itself isn't -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you're telling us that

1

some do this and some do that and the question is why

2

wouldn't following one protocol rather than another

3

protocol very significant evidence of what was intended?

4

MS. GARTNER:

Because some doctors use a two

5

day protocol, Your Honor, even if they don't expect to

6

get an intact D&E.

7

there's some correlation between the amount of dilation

8

and the percentage of times that a physician achieves

9

intact D&E.

There is not a direct correlation,

To some extent doctors also use other

10

agents to dilate, they use misoprostol and medication.

11

That even if they're doing a one day protocol -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do we have any indication

13

in your case about the effective safety of any other

14

aspect of this procedure if these doctors would change

15

their, their method of operation and go to a one-day

16

protocol?

17

MS. SMITH:

In terms, one-day protocol?

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

MS. GARTNER:

Yes.

Some doctors -- I think one

20

thing is that doctors perform abortions most safely when

they do them in a way that they are most accustomed do.

what is important is that you assess, you assess the

avoiding fetal pain to the fetus.

important point, Your Honor, is that this, that the

to this effect, that -- in some cases this procedure

21

averts catastrophic health consequences for the woman.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If -- if the woman

2

can take into account the impact on the fetus at a

3

certain point in time, and your option, as you said some

4

physicians give, of fetal demise prior to the procedure,

5

why is that beyond the scope of things that Congress can

6

take into account?

7

MS. GARTNER:

Because what Congress has done

8

here is take away from women the option of what may be

9

the safest procedure for her.

This Court has never

10

recognized a state interest that was sufficient to trump

11

the woman's interest in her health.

12

her doctor together agree that proceeding in this way is

13

going to avert significant health risks to her, and the

14

testimony here is overwhelming that there are situations

15

where that occurs, this Court has never recognized a

16

state interest that was sufficient to trump that woman's

17

paramount interest in her health.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

here.

Given the overwhelming testimony from doctors

2

from the American College of Obstetricians and

3

Gynecologists, and this Court's holding in Stenberg,

4

where the record was less robust, that we have that

5

substantial medical authority here.

6

substantial medical authority, doctors need to be able

7

to use their appropriate medical judgment, in the words

8

of Roe and Casey, to provide this procedure for their

9

patients when in their judgment -- not in their

And given that

10

unfettered discretion, but in their sound clinical

11

experience and medical judgment it's going to be the

So this is -- again, it may be that the

number of women is not large, but for the women who are

significant.

MS. GARTNER:

Right.

That you can back up

I'm not sure that I

8

actually understood his answers though, because I think

9

that that's what we have here, in fact, is a

10

pre-enforcement proceeding to, to determine that this

11

law blanketly banned intact D&E abortions even when the

12

doctor believes it's, it would have significant health

13

benefits for the patient.

14

So this is not, I want to go back to,

15

because my light is on, Stenberg suggested that there

16

was a line that could constitutionally be drawn between

17

banned, between permissibly banned procedures and, and

18

procedures that have constitutional protection.

19

statute didn't draw the line and it didn't draw that

20

line in two ways.

21

this Court's view that because there is substantial

22

medical authority for the proposition that intact D&E is

23

sometimes safer, a health exception is absolutely needed

24

here, and they also refused to draw the line at what

25

this Court understood was the defining difference

But the

This, this statute defiantly rejected

2

between intact D&E and nonintact D&E.
In the Solicitor General's reply brief they

3

talk about the promise of Stenberg.

Well, the promise

4

of Stenberg was absolutely betrayed by Congress in this

5

case in both respects, both in terms of preserving the

6

health of the woman and allowing her to use what a

7

substantial medical authority thinks is the safest

8

procedure for the woman, and in terms of holding the

9

line at a limited ban on pre-viability abortions given

10

that Casey recognized that women have a constitutional

11

right to choose to end their pregnancy pre-viability.

12

I was going to address briefly some of the

13

concerns that the Solicitor General offered about some

14

of the health risks of intact D&E and cervical

15

incompetence.

16

witnesses in this case agreed that the congressional

17

findings completely overstate any risks of intact -

18

there is no, there is no reasonable basis to conclude

that intact D&E puts a woman at any greater risk of harm

with the woman.

6

was the intact D&E itself that caused cervical

incompetence in the subsequent pregnancies because of

So there is no reason to think that it

And finally, yes, it's true that Dr. Chasen

used intact D&E or attempted to use intact D&E in all

11

cases, and the women who had D&Es, three of them

12

suffered very serious medical consequences after having

a D&E. The Solicitor General says well, Dr. Chasen tried

14

to do intact and he failed so, so there was really

15

nothing to say about this law.

16

law went into effect, no woman could have intact D&E. So

even though, even in those cases where Dr. Chasen was

able to do intact D&E, he would no longer be able to do

of a future pre-enforcement as applied challenge that

something, though, that one can reach in this record,

It's a heterodox position, it's not the majority

The other thing it's not focused on, and

13

this is in reference to something that Justice Breyer

14

mentioned, it's not focused on emergencies.

15

thing that the district court noted at page 128a of its

16

opinion is that the D&E procedure and the D&X procedure,

17

neither of them are particularly good in dealing with

18

true medical emergencies where time is of the essence,

19

because both these procedures require substantial

20

advance time to do the dilation.

21

procedure requires more dilation, I actually think in an

22

emergency, you'd probably end up performing the D&E

23

procedure if you performed either one, because you'd

24

need less time for the dilation in an emergency.

25

Another

regime that respondents would construct is a legal

regime where the woman can decide whether or not to have
