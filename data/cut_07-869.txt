ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLAY R. SMITH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is narrowed to a single, but from

12

the Petitioner's perspective a critical, dispute over

13

the scope of internal State sovereignty:

14

First Amendment trumps the otherwise existing authority

15

of the Idaho legislature to direct political

16

subdivisions of the State to take an action, here

17

restricting access to their payroll systems, that the

18

subdivisions could take independently without violating

19

the Amendment.

20

whether the

The genesis of this dispute is Idaho Code

21

Section 44-2004(2), which was adopted in 2003.

22

provision prohibits State and local government public

23

employers from deducting amounts for political

24

activities from the payroll checks due to their

25

employees and remitting those amounts to third parties.

conclusion?

18

20

And you concede the

We do.
And what is the difference

between the private employer and the county agency?
MR. SMITH:

Well, the principal difference

22

is that one is a private employer -- that is to say,

23

engaging in private speech -- while the public employer

24

is a -- is a subdivision of the State of Idaho, subject,

25

we would argue, to the plenary control, pursuant to the

confusing parts of this case.

you are left with the county employees.

8

would have gone about telling them they can't do this?

I mean the county employers.

You sort of paired off a

If you

Would you have passed a

10

law saying that the county employers are not allowed to

11

have this checkoff?

12

13

and say don't do this, right?

14

If you think they are part of the

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, in a word, the

15

answer is no.

I don't believe we, referring to the

16

Petitioners in this case, could have written the -- the

17

political subdivisions of a State to direct them to take

18

an action unless there was a legislative basis for doing

19

so.

20

In this instance, the -- the legislature

21

concluded that it wanted all public employers, among

22

others, to not allow access to their payroll systems.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do I understand that the

24

counties, if they elected to, could decide not to -- not

25

to do the checkoff?

MR. SMITH:

Prior to the adoption of the

statute in 2003, yes.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And so why should counties

be different from -- from -- I'm still puzzled about why

5

counties -- county employers are different from private

6

employers in terms of the State interest in preventing

7

the checkoff.

8
9

MR. SMITH:
difference, Your Honor.

Well, there is a fundamental
And -- and it rests in the

10

notion that the State has no interest in the -- in

11

private employers' determination to be involved or not

12

involved in political matters.

13

however, has a very concrete interest in avoiding either

14

the reality or the appearance -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The State legislature,

If you -- if you think of

16

the case as a principal-agent case so that the principal

17

can direct the agent as to what to do, the agent being

18

the county, then it seems to me that the unions might

19

still have an argument that this is an unconstitutional

20

condition.

I've been looking for ways to examine this

22

case.

The public forum doesn't really work for me.

that because I think that follows on Justice Stevens's

11

line of questioning.

but it seems to me that is consistent with what he is

13

asking.

MR. SMITH:

I didn't mean to interrupt him,

Because the statute at issue

here, Justice Kennedy, speaks across the board to a

16

specific kind of conduct, political activities.

The answer is no.

its literal terms.

You don't know.

Okay.

So,

We do know -- what I'm wondering
9


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is:

Isn't this case, to me, quite confused about

2

something fairly simple?

3

one, do you or do you not in Idaho allow anybody to have

4

payroll deductions for anything?

5

answer to that question is:

6

payroll deductions for some things.

7

The question would be:

Look,

And I take it your

Yes, we do allow some
Okay?

So then we look at this one, and it says:

8

No payroll deductions for union activities that are

9

political.

All right?

Now, you either do have or you

10

do not have a justification for that difference.

11

have a reasonable, or whatever the sufficient test is,

12

justification for the difference, you win.

13

don't, you lose.

14

or the county could have to do with the plausibility of

15

the justification.

16

If you

And if you

And, indeed, whether you are the State

Here we are, end of case, traditional.

You

17

just -- you didn't argue it that way, I guess, below.

18

What's wrong with that?

19

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, in fact, we argued

20

below that there was no constitutional right of access

21

to the payroll system for purposes of making political

22

contributions.

23

And let me reiterate at this -

JUSTICE BREYER:

There certainly, I would

24

think, would be a problem if the right-to-work people

25

can get there.

And you are not going to let the unions

is treated alike for good reason, probably okay.

6

But I don't know the facts.

So shouldn't we

Please look at what

If they have to treat some people one

MR. SMITH:

Well, the -- I would suggest

7

that a remand for that purpose would be futile.

The

8

district court, as I said before, concluded that the

9

statute is viewpoint neutral.

And let me stress that

10

the term "political activities" does not -- is not

11

defined with reference to unions or speech by other

12

entities that might be controlled by unions.

13

It addresses political contributions for

14

electoral matters, independent expenditures, and

15

expenditures to political parties.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would -- would they include

17

contributions to an organization that makes

18

contributions to political parties -

19

MR. SMITH:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

Yes, to the -- such as a right-to

work-organization?
MR. SMITH:

To the extent that the -- the

23

organization is, for example, a political action

24

committee, it would.

25

And let me go back to Justice Ginsburg's
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question for a moment.

Had the legislature intended

2

44-2004(2) to apply only to unions, they would have -

3

it would have been engaging in a redundancy because

4

under another provision of the same legislation,

5

44-2603(1)(b)(iv), which appears at petition appendix

6

70, the Idaho legislature proscribed amounts being -

7

amounts -- required all amounts to be paid -- paid to a

8

separate segregated fund which was established pursuant

9

to the legislation that was invalidated by the district

10

court, required those kinds of contributions to be made

11

directly by the employee and not through -- or not by

12

the employee's employer.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

what -- what is the situation?

But unions do have a

23

special prerogative which -- which no other

24

organizations, as far as you're aware, have in the

25

State, which is to have money deducted from people's

2
3

MR. SMITH:

That's -- that's correct.

The

--

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No other

5

organization other than the Federal, State and local

6

governments.

7

MR. SMITH:

True.

But let -- let me -- let

8

me continue with my response to Justice Scalia's

9

question.

10

The special prerogative that, for example,

11

the Pocatello Education Association or the firefighters

12

union has is the ability to engage in collective

13

bargaining pursuant to State statute as the exclusive

14

bargaining representative of, for example, the Pocatello

15

School District's teachers.

16

That exclusivity which is granted to a

17

limited number of -- of -- in fact, two areas under

18

Colorado -- excuse me -- under Idaho law, namely,

19

firefighters and teachers, is the extraordinary benefit

20

that unions have.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

The point of my

22

question is it doesn't seem to be terribly

23

discriminatory if indeed the only organizations in the

24

State that are given the right, whether by Federal or

25

State law, to deduct, private organizations, given the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right to deduct from the salary a municipal or private

2

employer pays.

3

discriminatory to say that, moreover, in making those

4

deductions, no part of it will be given for political

5

activities.

6

class, but it's a narrow class that has a special

7

benefit.

8
9

It doesn't seem to me particularly

I mean you're only addressing a narrow

MR. SMITH:

Well, I would agree that -- that

unions have, and particularly these -- particularly the

10

Respondents have a special benefit.

11

back to the basic point that 2004(2) addresses all

12

public employers or public employees and is not limited

13

to political activity contributions.

14

example, as the situation is here, to a union-sponsored

15

political action -- political action committee.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But again, I go

That might be, for

May I ask a question

17

about, say, an attempt to deduct contributions to a

18

charity like the United Fund?

19

to either do that or not do it, or does State law

20

require them to accept such requests?

21
22

MR. SMITH:

25

Local governments have

discretion.

23
24

Do counties have a choice

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They have discretion to do

that?
MR. SMITH:

That's correct.
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

With respect to the union

situation, the statute takes away that discretion.

3

MR. SMITH:

With respect -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the question is why is

5

there -- why is there a State interest in taking away

6

that discretion for unions, but not as to charities.

7

MR. SMITH:

Well, it takes away that

8

discretion with respect to any third party who might

9

receive amounts for political activities.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

For political activities.

11

But what is -- what is the reason for differentiating

12

political activities from charities?

13

MR. SMITH:

The reason, as we articulate in

14

our brief, is the desire to avoid either the appearance

15

or the reality of public employer involvement in, in

16

this instance, electoral politics.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I see.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are there other

19

areas in which the State exercises the authority you're

20

asserting here with respect to county employers, telling

21

them what they can and can't do?

22
23

MR. SMITH:

not with respect to payroll deductions.

Outside the area of elections,

2

other side, this is acceptable with respect to State

5
6

Why

not?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

that underlies your argument that the local entities are

17

creatures of State law and they cannot receive Federal

18

powers from the Federal Government when the States

19

object, is that -- is that an acceptable proposition?

20

MR. SMITH:

It would be an acceptable

21

proposition to the extent that Federal law doesn't

pre-empt State law, Your Honor.

and between the local-government units and the

3

4

for you quite apart from any application of Federal law.

5

And it seems to me that that's a problem

MR. SMITH:

I disagree, Justice Souter.

-- as I stated in response to Justice Stevens, the

7

difference is a central one.

9

rights under the First Amendment.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

That is to say, a

Well, it has distinct

11

rights under the First Amendment if State law creates a

12

corporate form of -- of -- of business organization.

it then does acquire some rights under the national

creature of State law, its powers, generally speaking,

17

are the powers that State law gives it.

18

that same proposition is true of counties and towns and

19

20

But if in the first instance it's a

MR. SMITH:

And that is -

I disagree to the extent that

21

there is any attempt to equate a private corporation

with essentially an agent or an arm of the State such as

a county, which has been delegated governmental

functions.

seems to me that your argument is not that State law

Your Honor, I -- I can only

repeat that the distinction between the private

22

MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case turns on three points.

First, the

23

statute at issue is a content-based restriction on

24

speech which is therefore presumptively invalid,

25

requires heightened scrutiny, which Petitioners
25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

acknowledge they have not satisfied, unless one of the

2

exceptions to heightened scrutiny is applicable here,

3

those being exceptions which as the Court has explained

4

in R.A.V. and Davenport, are limited to circumstances

5

where there is no real risk of viewpoint suppression.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Collins, suppose -- I

7

gather Idaho doesn't have it, but suppose Idaho wanted a

8

Hatch Act similar to the Federal Hatch Act that

9

prohibits Federal employees from engaging in political

10

activity, and suppose it decided that not only should

11

the State employees at the capital not engage in

12

political activities, but it's a problem for any

13

governmental employee to do that; they ought to be

14

neutral and we don't want patronage to be passed out on

15

the basis of whether they are campaigning for one party

16

or another, and we don't want them to be coerced into

17

campaigning for one party or another.

18

that such a law would violate the First Amendment if it

19

were extended to all employers.

20

employee, no private employee can engage in political

21

activity would surely violate the First Amendment.

22

Would it violate the First Amendment if it was extended?

23

Certainly, it doesn't when it's applied to State

24

employees because there are a lot of State Hatch Acts.

25

And you're saying it would violate the First Amendment

Now, I assume

Saying no -- no company

as applied to county and municipal employees?

2

MR. COLLINS:

Not at all, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. COLLINS:

Why not?

We don't take that position at

5

all, because, as the Court has indicated in Letter

6

Carriers and Broadrick and other cases, there is a

7

compelling interest in a statute which says that

8

government employees -- and it could be State or local

9

-- will not be performing their jobs as servants of

10

politics.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In the

2

MR. COLLINS:
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not a forum analysis.

Let me just establish something at

3

the outset.

You had conceded below, and I thought I saw

4

this in your brief as well, that as to the State of

5

Idaho, its determination not to allow the deductibility

6

is permissible.

7

MR. COLLINS:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

That's correct, Your Honor.
All right.

So, we begin

with the proposition that a State may do this if it

10

chooses; i.e., this -- refused on its own to have the

11

payroll deduction.

12

MR. COLLINS:

Yes.

And the reason for that

13

is that, under Regan and Finley and Rust and the other

14

cases, the State has perfect freedom to decide not to

15

devote its own resources and expenditure.

16

interestingly and very much on point here -

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

And if -- and if a State

18

had a system in which all payroll deductions were -- by

19

local entities -- were routinely controlled by the

20

State, the State did all the pay roles for the local

21

entities, then it -- in that case the nondeductibility

22

would also be permitted, I take it.

23

MR. COLLINS:

Yes, Your Honor, and let me

24

explain because those are two -- the answer to both

25

questions is "yes" but for two very different reasons.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The answer to the second question is that our contention

2

is not that the State is never a proprietor and never

3

entitled to the kind of deference that goes with the

4

proprietor when it's dealing with local government

5

programs.

6

Greenberg case, a government can become a proprietor

7

with respect to property or programs it doesn't actually

8

own.

9

As the Court noted in the Council of

Our point is quite simply that the State has not
That's why, if the State had done it,

10

if the State said we are going to dictate the nature of

11

payroll deduction systems for and local governments, the

12

State could do that, and it would be then -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did you have any

14

doubt how they would?

15

dictating that with respect to everybody.

And then it's

16

pared down by litigation and concessions.

So, we don't

17

have any real question of what the State is wanting to

18

do here.

19

I mean, they passed a law

It's MR. COLLINS:

What I'm suggesting, Mr. Chief

20

Justice, is that since we are beginning with a

21

content-based restriction -- and I do want to emphasize

22

it's a law here which says that for all employers -

23

public, private, or State -- the only expenditure you

24

can't make through payroll deduction is for political

25

activities, and also the only resource of an employer
29
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that can't be used for any kind of political activity is

2

payroll deduction, this being in a statute targeted at

3

employee support of union activity.

4

content-based restriction, and the question is:

5

come within an exception to the heightened scrutiny that

6

Petitioners acknowledge they can't satisfy?

7

So, we have a
Can it

But when I'm suggesting that the State could

8

come within reduced scrutiny if it were actually

9

managing the payroll system, I'm referring to situations

10

like Council of Greenburg, where the government with

11

respect to a particular kind of facility or program

12

says, we don't own it, but we -- it's an integral part

13

of a system that we are managing, establishing, not just

14

saying -- not just to say all we care about is one kind

15

of speech we don't want to go on there.

16

government says we have -- we want to be the manager,

17

the operator of a particular kind of local government

18

operation, the State is free to do that -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the

Well, if the State wants

20

to, it's because it can exercise a heavy hand and

21

control its local units, but if it wants to give the

22

local units discretion, then it has to leave it to the

23

local units whether or not they want to enact such a

24

ban.

25

That's your position?
MR. COLLINS:

No.

It's not a question of

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether the State has the power to regulate.

2

question is if the State regulation is in the form of a

3

content-based restriction on speech, can it elude

4

heightened scrutiny?

5

The

And -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

My question really is, if

you look at this at the most basic level, we have two

7

important concessions.

14

MR. COLLINS:

And

So here we

Do we bracket them with

Your Honor, functionally

15

that's the question, but I think analytically we don't

16

see it that way because the question is, as we see it,

17

is the State, with regard to this challenged statute in

18

its application to the local governments, acting in a

19

capacity that entitles it to be free from the normal

20

First Amendment scrutiny that it acknowledges it would

21

fail--

22

free from that scrutiny as to its own employees is

23

because of the cases that say the government doesn't

24

have to spend its money.

25

and that's where our point is.

JUSTICE BREYER:

where you are, that I've always had a hard time not for

5

thing I don't understand it about is it seems to me

edges, but one thing that the Court has been clear on is

We'd be quite happy, and I think the most
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sensible way actually to approach the case is that this

2

is a content distinction, and it's presumptively

3

invalid, and there is no sufficient justification.

4

The other side says wait a minute; there is

5

a line of cases that says that when there is a forum

6

involved of the government, and the government is

7

restricting speech in that forum, there can be an

8

exception to heightened scrutiny.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

In Davenport -

You say there is a

10

sufficient -- presumably you concede there is a

11

sufficient justification for this content-based

restriction as to State employees.

MR. COLLINS:

What we say as the State

employees, Justice Alito, is that if falls under the

Regan-Findley line of cases; that you don't even get to

doctrine that when the government says we won't spend

speech in the first place.

sufficient?

it would arguably be into that category.

7

funds that fund local government entities?

8
9

I mean, you say here there are State taxpayers'

MR. SMITH:

But are there State

There is State funding, but the

reason, I believe, why the Respondents -- excuse me the

10

Petitioners -- have conceded that the subsidization case

11

law does not apply to this statute in its application to

12

the local governments, is that what the subsidization

13

cases are talking about -- cases like Regan, Rust,

14

Findley -- are situations where we'll say the State is

15

involved in developing a program which it will pay for,

16

and it says because we are paying for that, our

priorities are to be honored.

18

The government in this instance, it's been

conceded, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, there is

20

no actual subsidization to the payroll systems.

effect the State says we have some money we give to our

to perform functions at the State level or whether the

10

State is authorizing taxation for functions for

11

functions to be performed at the local level -- in all

12

of these instances, the State is in the position to say

13

not that it is sort of our money, but to say it is

14

public money.

15

will not be used to -- by a public entity to underwrite

16

political activity.

And our decision is that public money

And why isn't the State in exactly the same

18

position in making that judgment, whether it's talking

19

about money that goes directly into the State coffer or

20

public tax money that happens to be going into a -- a

21

town coffer?

22

MR. COLLINS:

Because, Your Honor, I think

23

the courts never applied the Regan subsidization

24

analysis in that kind of -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I'm -- I'm asking you

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

why shouldn't -

2

MR. COLLINS:

It shouldn't -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why shouldn't we, on the

4

theory that what is important is not which particular

5

coffer the penny goes into, but the fact that it is

6

public money, i.e., money being raised from taxpayers

7

under a statute passed by the State authorizing

8

taxation; and it is going to -- and its justification

9

for taxation is the performance of public functions.

10

And if the State can say it is not a proper public

11

function when the money is being filtered through our

12

particular treasury, why isn't it equally valid for the

13

State legislature to say that when the money is being

14

filtered through a local treasury?

15

MR. COLLINS:

For the following reason, I

16

think, Justice Souter.

That -- the doctrine that says

17

when a government is refusing to subsidize something

18

there is no violation in the first place in the First

19

Amendment, and therefore except in the rarest, rarest of

20

cases -- the rarest of cases there can be no First

21

Amendment claim; that's very powerful medicine and it

22

turns on the notion that -- somewhat alike but different

23

from in detail the proprietor concept -- but it turns on

24

the notion that the government is making judgments about

25

how its money is going to be used.
38
Alderson Reporting Company

It decides what it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wants its money to be used for, and we are going to

2

honor that -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but what you're saying

4

is, I -- you're saying in effect that I -- that you

5

reject my -- my hypothetical assumption here, that what

6

we ought to regard as the proper characterization of the

7

money is not "our" State money, but public money raised

8

under a system of public taxation; and you're saying you

9

should not go -- you should not characterize the funds

10

that way.

11

Of course that's your position -

12

MR. COLLINS:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, I -- because if you do

14

characterize the funds that way, it seems to me you're

15

in trouble.

16

MR. COLLINS:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

characterize them that way?

19

MR. COLLINS:

Now But why shouldn't I

The -- even characterizing -

20

even characterizing it that way, the reason that I think

21

the analysis breaks down as to applying subsidization

22

law, is that the subsidization law doctrine,

23

subsidization doctrine -- Regan and those cases -- as

24

the Court has explained it, it is to protect the

25

prerogatives of the government that is making decisions
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about how it wants particular programs to be operated.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The State -- the State

3

legislature is making a decision as to how it wants the

4

-- the programs which comprise local government to be

5

operated.

6

MR. SMITH:

But the difference, Your Honor,

7

in all of the other cases one could look at Regan and

8

the like, there is a program where the government is

9

involved in its manifold details.

The government

10

determines the purpose of the program; it has an

11

overriding interest in the program; and it says in the

12

course of that, in the course of dealing with this

13

program, we don't want government money to be used for

14

the following things.

15

If you -- if that were extended to say that

16

there will be essentially no First Amendment claim

17

whenever the government says as to some program that it

18

has no other involvement and that it has no other

19

interest in, we don't want the following speech, and

20

over here we don't have the following speech -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but the point in the

22

case that you concede that the government may make that

23

choice is that the government is subsidizing it by the

24

activity which the government is refusing to perform.

25

So it's not nearly a case of saying there shall be this
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

kind of speech and not that kind of speech.

2

instance there is a decision being made in my

3

hypothetical that the government will not subsidize that

4

kind of activity, that kind of speech, by using public

5

money.

6

MR. COLLINS:

In each

But the difference for First

7

Amendment analysis, I would submit, Your Honor, and the

8

reason why I think the subsidization doctrine has been

9

confined in the areas it's been confined, is when we are

10

talking in this case, for example, about the State, the

11

State determines whether it's going to have a payroll

12

deduction system.

13

allow deductions for charities; whether it's going to

14

allow deductions for this that and the other.

15

determines who -- who's going to administer the program,

16

how expensive it's going to be, all of those things.

17

Its money is going into that program and it is as to

18

that program making all of these decisions about how its

19

money is going to be spent.

20

course of that it says we don't want this one, this

21

element as part of it just as we do want charitable, we

22

don't want political; maybe we don't want charitable

23

either -- it is a different situation in items of basic

24

First Amendment analysis, I believe, if you have a

25

government that's saying we don't care anything about

It determines whether it's going to

It

That is -- and if the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Collins, may I

3

interrupt you and ask you the converse of the question I

4

asked your opponent?

5

He conceded that it was unconstitutionally

6

what you call it, content discrimination -- whatever -

7

to have the deduction from the private sector, but the

8

counties were different; and he justified the counties

9

on the ground that the State's interest in avoiding

10

taking a position with regard to union matters justifies

11

it.

12

not the administrative justification -- this statute

13

wasn't enacted to save the government administrative

14

expenses.

15

clear, and I'm surprised that you concede that it's

16

constitutional as applied to the State government, when

17

there's no evidence whatsoever that it serves the

18

purpose that everybody is talking about.

19

But that's the only justification for the -- it's

The purpose of the statute is perfectly

MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, we conceded that

20

reluctantly under the view that where the question is

21

whether the State -- our claim against the State would

22

say we are -- we are going to require the State to start

23

devoting money that it doesn't want to spend as we -- we

24

have chosen given the force of cases like Regan, not to

25

make that contention, but to accept the ruling that the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State's refusal to spend money on its own programs is in

2

a different category.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But this is not a case

4

involving a State's decision not to spend the time and

5

energy to do payroll deductions because they do them for

6

everybody else.

7

payroll deduction, which is, in your view, an

8

impermissible reason.

9

It's simply based on the reason for the

Is that not correct.

MR. COLLINS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

10

And if it were clear that as to what kinds of reasons

11

are considered impermissible under subsidization -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How can it not be clear?

13

It enacted a general statute that had the same

14

justification throughout the State.

15

justifying on the ground it doesn't apply to all their

16

other government activities because they allow payroll

17

deductions.

18

MR. COLLINS:

And now you're

Well, in Davenport, Your

19

Honor, the Court did indicate that a statute that

20

applies to public and private, even though it's a

21

unitary statute, you have to analyze it separately in

22

the two contexts.

23

But our point, though -- I think the point

24

that is being lost, we don't see this as a question

25

about what can the State do with respect to its own
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

operations as such and what can it do with respect to

2

local government operations.

3

asks the question whether a content distinction directed

4

at certain kinds of political activities that would

5

normally require heightened scrutiny gets the pass from

6

that scrutiny because it's in a "forum"?

7

We see it as a case that

And we -- our position is quite simply that

8

if the State were, in fact, managing these local

9

government payroll systems, which it would have a

10

perfect right to do, that then it could avail itself of

11

that analysis, but because it doesn't, it cannot.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I see your argument.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the State at the

14

State level says this is a contentious area, we want to

15

stay out of it.

16

simply not allowing payroll deduction for right to work

17

clauses, for union clauses.

18

State can say that, and your concession indicates to me

19

that it can, then why can't it tell its subdivisions you

20

have to be efficient, we don't want arguments from one

21

city to the next city about payroll deduction that's

22

going to consume the time of the city council's, the

23

time of the citizens, we want to take this off the table

24

for you just the way we've taken it off the table for

25

us?

We are going to be neutral.

We are

We don't want this.

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. COLLINS:

Because I think the difference

2

here, Your Honor, as I understand the case law, is that

3

when the State is simply saying we choose not to spend

4

our own money on this activity, it does not have the

5

same burden of explaining why it's made that choice that

6

it has when it reaches out and says, and by the way, we

7

don't want local government or even private government

8

Well, of course, that's

cannot tell the counties that it has certain duties for

16

This is a very strong Federal interest in

MR. COLLINS:

Our gun control

And we have no quarrel at all

17

with that notion.

18

no way has the First Amendment dictating how a State is

19

going to structure its government.

20

look, we begin with the proposition that normally this

21

restriction on public speech would be heightened to

22

public scrutiny.

Our position in no way dictates, in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It simply says,

I -- I -- I'm not sure

that's right.

I'm not sure the State isn't saying we

want to determine how our government is structured in
45
Alderson Reporting Company

this respect.

2

MR. COLLINS:

If the -- if the State wants

3

to have a uniform law for itself -- for public

4

employer -- employees, its own employees and local

5

government employees because of some unitary interest

6

that the State wants to pursue, there is nothing wrong

7

with the state pursuing that objective.

8

does it through restricting political speech, it has to

9

either satisfy heightened scrutiny or come within one of

10

But when it

the exceptions.

11

And the distinction -- maybe I can put it

12

this way, Justice Kennedy.

The reason why for First

13

Amendment scrutiny analysis, there is a sharp

14

distinction in this case between what the State's

15

treatment of its own employees and the State treatment

16

of local governments is -- I think it's basically

17

threefold.

18

That, first, when the State says, we don't

19

choose to allow certain speech in our own forum, it is

20

simply declining to facilitate speech that couldn't take

21

place without an affirmative grant.

22

local governments, who in the state of nature can allow

23

whatever they want in the way of speech, when it says

24

that there we will not allow these kinds of deductions,

25

it's blocking speech that would take place but for the
46

When it says to

government's intervention.

And so -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'll read Russo again, but

3

I didn't think Pocatello, Idaho, was part of the state

4

of major.

5

MR. COLLINS:

I just meant that no -- it's

6

this simple, Justice Kennedy, and the point I'm trying

7

to make is that for someone to get access to

8

political -- to a payroll deduction system of the State

9

government, it needs an affirmative grant from the

10

State.

11

from local governments, it doesn't need an affirmative

12

grant from the State.

13

interfere and reject the local government.

14

To have access to the use of payroll deduction

It simply needs the State not to

So it's -- it's a different kind of action.

15

But equally important, the basis for the kind of relaxed

16

scrutiny that the -- that the Petitioners have argued

17

for, the forum cases like Cornelius, et cetera, those

18

are all situations where a government, that is, that has

19

established and managed a facility is determining on a

20

day-to-day basis what's the purpose of our program, what

21

are we going to allow -

this?

Alderson Reporting Company

2

doesn't seem to me to quite fit.
MR. COLLINS:

It's fine with me, but if you

3

analyze it in any way that says that heightened scrutiny

4

is applicable and there is no exception -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why is that?

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. COLLINS -- the problem with

8

constitutional condition -- if it were a condition on

9

the local governments, then it's not really -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Are you saying -- is it

11

your view that heightened scrutiny applies whenever a

12

government tells any group that wants to raise money for

13

political purposes in any way they want involving the

14

government that it can't?

15

MR. COLLINS:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17
18

No, Your Honor.
No.

Okay.

I thought the

answer would be no.
Then, will you try to say in a sentence or

19

two if the answer is it heightened scrutiny doesn't

20

apply to any kind of an effort to raise money for

21

political purposes where they say to the government you

22

got to help me, when does it apply and when doesn't it?

23

MR. COLLINS:

The -- well, there are

24

exceptions to heightened scrutiny where the government

25

is acting as a proprietor.

There are exceptions to
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

heightened scrutiny where the government -

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

But then you are making -

3

say it always applies except in a few little exceptions.

4

I mean I know there is one for government speech and so

5

forth.

6

a person you can't, for example, go to the city hall and

7

raise money, you can't do it in the jury room, you can't

8

raise money here, you can't raise money there, dah, dah,

9

dah, or you can't speak there, you can't -- it's always

10

But you're saying whenever the government tells

heightened scrutiny?

11
12

MR. COLLINS:

Well, if the government is

allowing other speech it would be heightened scrutiny.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

You cannot -- you have to

14

use heightened scrutiny when the FDA, for example -- you

15

know, the case I wrote in -- the FDA says you cannot

16

advertise on a label for a drug.

17

advertising.

18

That's heightened scrutiny.

19

We don't want

We don't want advertising on the label.

MR. COLLINS:

It -- if it's -- if it's

20

commercial speech, it might fall under a different

21

standard.

22

mean, this is no question that a lot of situations

23

easily pass heightened scrutiny, and a lot of

24

circumstances are an exception.

It basically would trigger

But the problem -- where the shoe doesn't
fit the Petitioner's are trying to put on this case is

10

Petitioner's concede everything there is to concede

11

about this case and then say but it's just like

12

Cornelius, and it's just the government deciding what to

13

do with its own programs.

14

that unlike every case where the court has applied

15

relaxed scrutiny in a proprietary situation, this is a

16

case where the government does not play any role with

respect to the -- to limit the speech.
