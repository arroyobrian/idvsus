CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

Mr. Moseley.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. MOSELEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. MOSELEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At issue in this case is an aggravated

11

felony definition, 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), one that

12

serves both as a ground of deportation and as an

13

integral part of a Federal criminal statute.

14

For the Court's convenient reference,

15

because I suspect we will return to this and the other

16

definitions, I would refer the Court to the statutory

17

appendix in the government's brief:

18

gives the conviction requirement; and 7a to 8a gives the

19

underlying criminal statute in which this aggravated

20

felony definition forms an integral part.

21

3a gives (M)(i); 6a

Now, Congress has required -- for

22

deportation, Congress has required conviction of this

23

defined offense, in a definition that says absolutely

24

nothing about the word "tether" utilized by the Third

25

Circuit below, and the definition begins with a
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

restrictive clause, "that," to require conviction of

2

both the fraud and deceit element and also the loss

3

amount as an integral part of this definition.

4

Since Congress required conviction, the

5

time-honored categorical approach really should be the

6

governing standard, and I submit that there's nothing in

7

the plain language of the statute, the underlying

8

statute enacted by Congress, to oust that time-honored

9

approach, which I submit is perhaps on a par as being

10

presumptively applicable, similarly to the -- to the

11

stay standards that this Court discussed very recently

12

in the Nken case.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Another Under the time-honored No, please.
Under the time-honored

17

approach, if the jury verdict necessarily -- or not

18

necessarily, but did in fact refer to the amount

19

involved and it was over $10,000, would that be part of

20

the time-honored approach and then the statute would be

21

fulfilled?

22

MR. MOSELEY:

I -- under those

23

circumstances, Justice Kennedy, yes.

24

was specifically instructed that they did not have to

25

make any finding with respect to loss in this case.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

But here the jury

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, in that connection,

2

at some point in the argument -- and you may be a little

3

early because you're talking about the statute -- I'd

4

like to know either anecdotally from your experience or

5

-- or because it's written somewhere, how often do

6

juries give special verdicts?

7

the second case we're to hear as well.

8

9

experience, we just didn't know many of the features of

It actually applies in
And has that
In -- in my

10

the crime from -- from the jury verdict, and I just

11

would like to know if that's changed in this day and

12

age.

13

MR. MOSELEY:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15
16

Well, I -- I But you may reach that

after you've talked about the statute.
MR. MOSELEY:

Yes, but let me -- certainly

17

among the State statutes that we cite, the State

18

statutes where it's clear that a loss amount is an

19

element, the jury is going to be instructed they have to

20

return that, and they do.

21

opportunity here is in effect, I would submit, a kind of

22

lifeline, if you will, that we're giving to the

23

government in these -- in these more general fraud

24

statutes, where the government has that -- certainly has

25

that opportunity or that option to do.

The -- the special verdict

5

Alderson Reporting Company

But there

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certainly have been -- and I know we cite them in our

2

brief -- cases -

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if you -- if you do

4

extend that lifeline to the government, aren't you

5

conceding that the amount of the loss is not an element

6

of the offense, and aren't you conceding that it is not

7

necessary for the loss amount to be an element of the

8

offense?

9

MR. MOSELEY:

No, Justice Alito.

What I am

10

saying is that this statute -- and again, (M)(i) was

11

enacted as part of a number of criminal statutes -

12

excuse me -- as a number of provisions that were

13

addressed to white collar offenses, of which this is

14

just one, and it also encompasses the State -- it also

15

encompasses the State statutes where this clearly is -

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me give you a

17

concrete example.

Let's say it's a Federal mail fraud

18

case.

19

and you don't have to prove the amount of loss in order

20

to convict under the mail fraud statute.

21

case, after the jury returns a guilty verdict they also

22

return -- or together with that they answer a special

23

interrogatory and they say the loss exceeded $10,000.

24

In the second case, the defendant pleads guilty and

25

admits during the plea colloquy that the amount is more

Let's say there are two Federal mail fraud cases,

6

Alderson Reporting Company

In the first

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

than $10,000.

2

Would there be a problem in those cases?

MR. MOSELEY:

In those cases, no.

In those

3

cases, that would have satisfied the traditional

4

categorical approach.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this -

And then In this case, how many of

8

the defendants were alien?

You're -- the jury is given

9

a charge that covers all of the defendants.

10

11

12

MR. MOSELEY:

They're all

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then the judge wouldn't

19

distinguish -- it would not be relevant for the -- for

20

the defendants who were not aliens because it would have

21

no consequences for them.

22

even if the question could be asked, why should the

23

judge -- the judge takes a position:

25

charge it, and I'm not going to confuse the jury by

So why should the judge -

It's not an

Therefore, I'm not going to

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

saying as to the defendants who are aliens, you have to

2

find the amount.

3

MR. MOSELEY:

Well, under -- under those -

4

under those circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, Mr.

5

Nijhawan actually himself had asked for a charge with -

6

with respect to loss.

7

there's an issue of jury confusion here, and indeed

8

under -- under -- ironically under this Court's -- well,

9

this would have been a situation in which a request was

I don't think -- I don't think

10

-- could have been made.

11

been -- there certainly wouldn't have been jury

12

confusion to have requested it here.

13

I don't think there would have

But I think you have to put this in -- in

14

the larger picture of a statute of a set of aggravated

15

felony definitions that were enacted.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But before you go on to

17

that, we're talking about (M)(i).

18

another provision that's an offense that is described in

19

section 21 -- 7201 of Title 26 -- that's tax evasion -

20

in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds

21

10,000.

22

there's no requirement -- to convict someone of tax

23

evasion, the jury does not have to find the deficiency.

24
25

It's coupled with

So it's the same "in which" construction, and

MR. MOSELEY:

Well, actually, Justice

Ginsburg, under this Court's decision in Boulware, a
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

deficiency is indeed a necessary element of that -

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

A deficiency, but not the

amount of the deficiency.

4

MR. MOSELEY:

But -- no.

A -- a deficiency

5

is a necessary element of that offense.

6

that's where, for example, the Babaisakov decision got

7

that point flatly wrong.

8

classic -

9

That's -

And this is, I think, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is the amount -

10

there's a deficiency.

11

find tax evasion there is a deficiency.

12

find that the revenue loss to the government exceeds

13

$10,000?

14

The jury has to find in order to

MR. MOSELEY:

Does it have to

No, it doesn't have to find

15

that, but it may.

And this is a classic example of the

16

application of the modified categorical approach, where

17

this statute sweeps broadly to include both loss amounts

18

or, in this case, revenue loss amounts that would exceed

19

$10,000 and those that would be less than $10,000.

20

of these cases, most of the tax cases, as the

21

government's own materials that we cite indicate, are

22

resolved by guilty pleas with respect to where those

23

amounts are designated.

24

to realize that by pairing these two statutes, by

25

pairing these two provisions, (M)(i) and (M)(ii),

Most

And I think it's important here

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress in effect I submit sent the signal with that

2

language in (M)(ii) that we're talking about the kind -

3

we're talking about the application of the modified

4

categorical -

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the -- What is the

6

difference between a defendant's saying during a guilty

7

plea colloquy, the loss was -- I admit the loss was more

8

than $10,000; and the defendant's agreeing for

9

sentencing purposes that the loss was more than $10,000?

10

MR. MOSELEY:

Because, Justice Alito, in the

11

sentencing context we're truly dealing with a

12

post-verdict situation where the government in terms of

13

having to prove loss is up against a far lesser amount

14

-- a far more liberal standard, a preponderance of the

15

evidence standard.

16

circumstances -

17
18
19

And the defendant under those

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if he's admitting it,

what does the standard of the evidence matter?
MR. MOSELEY:

He's admitting it here,

20

Justice Souter, under these circumstances.

21

admitting it here only in the context of a resolution of

22

the sentencing issue.

23

He's

If you go back to the -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, he's not saying, I

24

admit to a degree of preponderance of the evidence that

25

it was over 10,000.

He's saying, period, over 10,000.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The burden of proof, the standard of proof doesn't

2

matter.

3

MR. MOSELEY:

No, but he's -- but he's doing

4

this in the context of resolving, of resolving a

5

disputed issue with respect to -

6
7

JUSTICE SOUTER:
resolves it by admission.

8
9

And he definitively

MR. MOSELEY:

But he does so certainly in

the context of reserving, of reserving his right to

10

contest that and to make the arguments that we're making

11

here.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, I understand the facts

13

of this case.

14

Justice Alito's question, and it would seem to me that

15

the answer to the question is there is no difference.

16

I was commenting on your answer to

MR. MOSELEY:

No, I submit -- I submit that

17

there -- there really is a -- a profound difference

18

under the circumstances of someone being in a situation

19

before, before conviction, and then someone being in a

20

postconviction situation.

21

come back in terms -- we should come back to the

22

underlying, to the underlying requirement that the

23

person had been -- the person under the statute be

24

convicted of the loss.

25

And then I think we should

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right, that really gets

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the question that I was going to ask, and that is, I

2

don't see how the modified categorical approach is

3

something that you could admit would be sufficient

4

because, as I understand your argument -- and it is in

5

part an argument based on sort of standard grammatical

6

construction -- you're saying that in the definition

7

"The term 'aggravated felony' means an offense that" -

8

and you emphasize the "that," the restrictive nature of

9

the "that" clause -- "involves fraud or deceit in which

10
11

the loss exceeds $10,000."
if I understand your restrictive clause argument,

12

the definition of the offense has got to include the

13

element of exceeding $10,000 or it does not satisfy

14

your, the -- it does not satisfy the standard that you

15

were arguing for based on the restrictive clause.

16

seems to me that you've got to go the whole hog or you

17

get nothing, and the whole hog is that it's got to be an

18

element of the offense that the loss exceed $10,000.

19

I wrong?

20

MR. MOSELEY:

So it

Am

I don't think necessarily.

21

Well, under these circumstances, Justice Souter, what I

22

would say is that there may be statutes, there may be

23

statutes in which, there are statutes, there are State

24

statutes, where you have a range of conduct that may

25

include $10,000, may not include $10,000, and the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

modified categorical approach would apply under those.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, how about this one.

3

You were arguing based on this statute and you make an

4

argument based on the restrictive nature of a "that"

5

modifying clause, and if you're going to make the

6

restrictive clause argument, it seems to me you've got

7

to go the whole hog and say the element of the offense

8

has got to include the loss in excess of $10,000.

9
10

MR. MOSELEY:

Certainly if it does, then

under the statutes involved here we would prevail.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, yeah, you would

12

prevail, but you would prevail, it seems to me, at the

13

expense of this objection, and the government makes it.

14

There are very, very few fraud and deceit statutes that

15

define the offense by reference to a loss in excess of

16

$10,000.

17

that they come up with three.

My recollection from the government's brief is

18

The fact is also that this provision, the

19

$10,000 figure, was placed into the statute at a time

20

when Congress was trying to expand the category of

21

deportable, removable offenses, and it would be passing

22

strange in that context to define the offense by

23

reference to a $10,000 figure as an element of the

24

offense which would cut it down, which would cut the

25

compass of the statute down to three offenses.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

What is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

your response to that?

2

MR. MOSELEY:

Well, I think the government

3

vastly understates the statutory provisions that were

4

involved here.

5

a majority of the State statutes, as I think we make

6

clear in our reply brief, a majority of States have

7

statutes, generally the theft by deception statutes and

8

others which have loss thresholds that will get you over

9

--

10

Even if you look at the State statutes,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, once you get into the

11

State statutes you get into the further problem of an

12

utter and I would suppose unjust patchwork of statutory

13

reference to which this would apply.

14

steal the $11,000 in State A, you get booted out of the

15

country.

16

B, you stay home.

17

would have enacted that kind of scheme.

18
19
20

If you -- if you

If you steal it across the State line in State
I mean, I can't imagine that Congress

MR. MOSELEY:

But what Congress has done

here is to provide for a uniform test, in effect.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

A uniform test that

21

produces both unjust results and I would suppose

22

strangely unsatisfying results to a Congress that wanted

23

to expand the concept of deportable offense.

24
25

MR. MOSELEY:

But what -- but what -- if I

can just go back for a moment, Justice Souter, to the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

original premise that it under all circumstances has to

2

be an element.

3

Federal statutes, for example, the theft from Federal -

4

federally funded programs, which give specific loss

5

amounts of 5,000 or more, which would -- which -- excuse

6

me.

7

There are certainly statutes, even

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the problem is that

8

there's no pattern to it, The point that Justice Souter

9

made.

If we take your position that there are a number

10

of statutes that mention amount, some as an element,

11

some by this, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to

12

when the amount is there and when it isn't, and then you

13

have these unequal results within the Federal system and

14

in the States, so when you think -- would it make any

15

sense for Congress to have drawn the line that way if

16

the State happens to make -- to have the "in which" or

17

if it just has fraud and deceit with no amount?

18

MR. MOSELEY:

What -- Justice Ginsburg, I

19

think what Congress did here was to create a uniform

20

test, a uniform test in the sense you look to see if -

21

if someone has been convicted of both these

22

requirements, fraud or deceit or the loss.

23

certainly produces far more uniformity than had -

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That

But it's treating people

who do the identical thing differently.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MOSELEY:

But Congress chose under these

2

circumstances, Congress chose under these circumstances

3

to -- swept broadly to, swept broadly to State statutes

4

in addition, in addition, in addition to, in addition to

5

encompassing the Federal statute.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what you're saying is

7

you're not denying that people who commit the identical

8

theft or deceit or fraud will be treated differently

9

depending on whether the statute under which they're

10

convicted has this "in which" clause?

11

MR. MOSELEY:

What I believe, what I believe

12

that I am conceding is that it will determine -- as with

13

any of the criminal cases that lead to deportation, it

14

will determine -- it will be determined on the basis of

15

how the prosecution chooses -- excuse me -- chooses to

16

charge.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Moseley Mr. Moseley, can I get

19

your help on a question I really have difficulty with.

20

It seems to me as I read the text, it is easy to read it

21

in one of two ways:

22

which the loss to the victim in fact exceeded $10,000.

23

In that case you would lose.

24

involves fraud or deceit in which an element of the

25

crime is that the victim or victims exceeded a loss of

It involves fraud or deceit in

Or it could be read to say

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

$10,000.

You would lose under that also because it is

2

not an element of the crime.

3

So you are relying on a modified approach,

4

and under your modified approach what does the statute

5

say?

6

MR. MOSELEY:

The -- the statute -- the

7

statute says that someone has to be convicted of -- of

8

both these aspects, both of -

9
10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the statute doesn't

say anything about conviction.

11

MR. MOSELEY:

If, Justice Stevens, if you

requirement -- in other words, to -- to be deportable,

14

to be deportable, that's in -- in 6a.

15

I don't -- I don't

19

understand how you squeeze your -- your modified

categorical approach, which seems to be a deus ex

21

machina which is intended to blunt the government's

22

argument that very few statutes would be covered by

23

this.

24

"convicted."

25

I don't see how you get that out of the word

Are you convicted of an offense involving
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

more than $10,000 if in a separate interrogatory the

2

jury, though it has no obligation in order to find you

3

guilty to say how much you stole, in an interrogatory

4

the jury says, oh, yes, the amount was more than

5

$10,000?

6

that?

7

You are convicted of the elements of the offense, not -

8

not of whatever, whatever the judge chooses to allow the

9

jury to be questioned about.

10

Does that cause you to have been convicted of

You are convicted of what you are charged with.

MR. MOSELEY:

I think under those

11

circumstances, though, particularly if you look at the

12

statutes which make gradations of sentencing on the

13

basis of loss amounts, you clearly would be convicted of

14

that.

15

that's going to -- that's a necessary fact that's going

16

to have to be found to put you in a particular

17

sentencing range.

18

-- you would be under those circumstances convicted of

19

that amount.

20

It is -- because that's a necessary element

So you -- so you definitely would be

But I think it's important to -- to

21

recognize what -- that Congress -- that Congress in

22

enacting the statute and in predicating removal upon

23

conviction used language that sharply distinguishes -

24

that is sharply distinguished from the position that the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we go back to my

4

question, which I don't think you've fully answered?

5

And that's the tax evasion situation.

6

person who is charged with tax evasion who goes to trial

7

and is convicted, that person would not be deportable,

8

as I understand it under your reading, because the jury

9

is not asked to determine the amount of the deficiency.

10

MR. MOSELEY:

For any tax -- a

Well, the jury -- under those

11

circumstances, it will depend upon how the government

12

chooses, Justice Ginsburg, to prosecute the case.

13

if the government chooses to prosecute the case by

14

seeking a determination of the deficiency amount in a

15

jury charge, then -- then, yes -- then, yes, indeed,

16

they would.

17

are resolved.

And

But again, the vast majority of these cases

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

most of them admit it at the plea stage.

trial, these are parallel provisions, and it seems to me

21

they are meant to operate the same way.

22

MR. MOSELEY:

I know.

You told me that
But going to

Well, they -- they are -- they

23

are meant to operate the same way.

24

what we have here is a situation where the fact that

25

deficiency is a requirement and that deficiency in most
19
Alderson Reporting Company

But I think that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases will be established by a plea, and that this is a

2

statute that sweeps broadly; that this is a statute that

3

sweeps -- excuse me -- sweeps broadly to encompass both

4

a loss in excess of 10,000 -- a deficiency in excess of

5

$10,000 or a deficiency under $10,000.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Did you have any authority

7

for the -- the idea that a trial judge in a criminal

8

case should ask the jury to answer a special

9

interrogatory regarding a question that has no bearing

10

on the conviction, but may have a bearing on the future

11

immigration status of the defendant, which is what

12

you're suggesting should be done in these tax cases?

13

MR. MOSELEY:

What -- what I am suggesting

14

in the tax case is that it would be perfectly

15

appropriate for the government to seek such a special

16

interrogatory if they wish to establish the tax loss,

17

which is an element of the -- which is a necessary

18

component of the offense, if they wanted to establish it

19

-- if they wanted to establish it for -- for purposes -

20

for whatever purpose they wanted to establish it.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I can see that if

22

there are multiple defendants in the case, some of the

23

defendants might say that this is unnecessary, it's

24

inflammatory.

25

MR. MOSELEY:

That's -- that's -- that 20

again, that is going to depend on -- that's going to

2

depend upon how the government chooses to -- to

prosecute under these particular -

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

underscores the fact that -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But all that just

-- your earlier -- your

7

earlier assertion that it was necessary to -- that -

8

that it would be necessary to get that -- that amount

9

specified for sentencing purposes is simply not true.

10

mean, we didn't -- we didn't hold that the guidelines

11

are mandatory, and you -- that you need a -- a jury

12

determination.

We've said they are discretionary.

13

MR. MOSELEY:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I So if you don't have a jury

15

determination, you can still sentence on the basis of

16

the amount taken, even though that was not found by the

17

jury.

18

I

MR. MOSELEY:

I -- I understand.

But my -

19

my point, Justice Scalia, on this one is that -- on

20

(M)(ii) is that it is -- it is a statute in which -- in

21

which loss can or is required to be shown, some

22

deficiency is required to be shown, and this may -- and

23

this may well be done by the modified -- the modified

24

categorical approach, particularly in -- in -

25

particularly in situations in which, as in most cases,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

it's resolved by a plea.
Now, if -- if -- but -- and also, this

3

statute was enacted against the backdrop of -- of the

4

categorical approach, and the act was amended -- has

5

been amended roughly four times during this period with

6

no indication that Congress certainly intended to

7

jettison this.

8

note the structure of the act in terms of how Congress

9

sharply distinguished between what would happen with

10
11

And I think it's also important here to

conviction and -- and what would happen with sentence.
They did enact specific provisions,

12

101(a)(43), subpart (F) at 2a of the statutory appendix

13

and (G) at 2a of the statutory appendix, which talk

14

about -- which -- which talk about sentencing and make

15

that sharp distinction.

16

But I think we should not also lose sight of

17

the overarching fact here that this provision is an

18

integral part of a Federal criminal statute, 1326(b), so

19

that any ambiguity in the -- so that an ambiguity in the

20

construction and application of this statute should as

21

-- similarly to -- to what this Court held in Leocal,

22

should be resolved in favor of the -- in favor of the

23

alien, because it's the classic multiple or dual use

24

statute that has both civil and criminal applications,

25

and very severe criminal applications as well.

13
14

16

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner's reading of subparagraph (M)(i)

17

implausibly excludes the mainstays of Federal fraud

18

prosecutions and applies at best to a tiny handful of

19

outlying offenses:

20

extreme cases of government contract fraud, and some

21

frauds obtaining confidential phone records and -

22

Thefts of major works of art,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, except -- except for

23

his modified hangout.

24

categorical does -- does expand; doesn't it?

25

MR. GANNON:

His modified -- his modified

Well, I -- I think, Justice
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Scalia, that he does offer this -- this variation on a

2

so-called modified categorical approach by saying that

3

we could use extraneous facts in guilty pleas in order

4

to satisfy the categorical approach.

5

that doesn't work for both practical reasons and for the

6

types of reasons that -- that several of the questions

7

raised in the first half of the argument -

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we think that

And also interrogatories to

the jury.

10

MR. GANNON:

He does seem to contemplate

11

that interrogatories for the jury might also achieve the

12

same purpose.

13

there -- there is little reason to believe that a judge

14

is going to permit such extraneous questions to be put

15

to a jury that are -- that are not necessary for the

16

criminal proceeding that is actually being held at that

17

point.

18

the entire -- wants to imply that the conviction needs

19

to turn on that.

20

But as Justice Alito was pointing out,

It's unlikely that the government wants to make

And obviously, both with the -- the special

21

interrogatories and the guilty pleas, there are

22

practical problems, because this could only apply

23

prospectively, even though Congress's definition of

24

aggravated felonies is intended to apply to convictions

25

that predated the enactment of IIRIRA.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

It -- I just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mean that it would not be until we knew that this was

2

the rule, that we could implement such -- such a rule.

3

And it's not clear why any alien who would be contesting

4

his removability in the civil removal proceedings would

5

concede in the -- in a guilty plea or to a fact that is

6

extraneous to that conviction that would ultimately -

relevant question for purposes of the loss threshold in

subparagraph (M)(i), which is actually about the -- the

loss to the victims from the offense involving fraud or

17

deceit, not how much any individual defendant might have

18

been responsible for.

19

He -- he asked for an

That's

And that's not the

And even now -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but then you

20

just -- you, the government, says -- you know, you'll

21

have a little debate about what the special

22

interrogatory, how it is phrased, and your objection

23

there could be dealt with on -- during that negotiation.

24
25

MR. GANNON:

Well, and at that point he -

he -- we -- we presumably wouldn't want to have to prove
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

up a loss at that point that's irrelevant for purposes

2

of the criminal guilt proceeding, although it may well

3

become relevant for the sentencing proceeding, as it did

4

become relevant here, and there was a sentencing

5

stipulation.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

a little bit?

And -- and why would you

Would you just spell that out

9

MR. GANNON:

10

could confuse the jury.

11

had nothing to do with a determination of guilt, that

12

would be a particularly odd sort of bifurcation to

13

thrust upon the original criminal proceeding, to require

14

the jury to make findings about facts that are truly

15

extraneous to the purposes of the criminal proceeding

16

that is being held there, and for -- at least for guilt

17

purposes, there is no reason for the jury to have to

18

find that.

19

Well, I -- I think that it
Even if it were clear that it

And as -- as the questions before were

20

making clear, the reason this Court has applied the

21

modified categorical approach is to determine what is

22

necessary for the underlying conviction.

23

it's tied to an investigation into what really were the

24

elements of the underlying offense.

25

about facts that were not, in fact, necessary for the
26
Alderson Reporting Company

That's why

And interrogatories

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

conviction or -- or extraneous facts that are introduced

2

into guilty pleas do not change the fact that that

3

particular attribute was not necessary for the

4

conviction.

5

And so, we think that it makes sense, in

6

context of the other definitions in paragraph 43 of the

7

definition of aggravated felonies, where it is

8

indisputable that there are multiple provisions that

9

include both an element that needs to be evaluated as an

10

element of the offense and some other limiting factor

11

that need not be an element of the offense; that it

12

makes sense to construe the loss threshold in

13

subparagraph (M)(i) as something that need not be an

14

element, because the consequences of Petitioner's

15

approach would be to read out virtually all Federal

16

fraud prosecutions, including such mainstays as mail

17

fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the government,

18

bank fraud, the offenses that were at issue here.

19

And he does offer a patchwork of some State

20

offenses that could be satisfied.

But even there,

21

there -- there's not any particular consistency to it.

22

He invokes the Model Penal Code, which has a gradation

23

scheme for theft by deception offenses.

24

the BIA has -- has acknowledged that theft by deception

25

offenses may in certain circumstances constitute fraud
27
Alderson Reporting Company

And although

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

offenses, the Model Penal Code does not in the next

2

chapter dealing with forgery and fraudulent practices

3

have a consistent gradation scheme.

4

So even in the States that Petitioner cites

5

in his reply brief, Delaware doesn't have monetary

6

thresholds for insurance fraud, even though it does for

7

health care fraud; and New Jersey doesn't have monetary

8

thresholds for credit card fraud or payment card fraud,

9

and so a million-dollar fraud would not be -- would not

10

be treated consistently, depending upon which State it

11

was committed in and even which type of fraud it was in

12

an individual State, if the State -

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I ask you this, does

14

this -- which is not exactly on point to the issue here,

15

but does the government have a theory about how the loss

16

is measured for purposes of this statute?

17

sentencing guidelines, the loss was a very complicated

18

calculation, lots of rules about relevant conduct and

19

lots of cases and different ways of proving loss, and

20

here we just have the statute.

21

MR. GANNON:

Under the

Yes, we think that it is not

22

necessarily the same as the loss determination that

23

would be made for sentencing.

24

made it very clear that even though a restitution order,

25

for example, can be sufficient evidence of loss to the

And so, the board has

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

victim, that it needs to be assessed with an eye to

2

exactly what losses were determined in the underlying

3

restitution order and with regard to the burden of proof

4

there.

5

And so JUSTICE ALITO:

What if you have somebody

6

who participates in a -- in a scheme involving

7

$100 million, the total loss is $100 million, but this

8

person had no way of reasonably anticipating that this

9

would be the -- the total amount of the loss, this was a

10

minor participant, and -- where would the -- how would

11

that come out?

12

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that the text of

13

the statute here in subparagraph (M)(i) talks about an

14

offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss

15

to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.

16

think that the loss threshold is tied to the offense

17

that involves fraud or deceit, not to the individual

18

defendant's role.

19

And so, we

If he's convicted of a $100 million fraud or

20

in this case what may well have been a $683 million

21

fraud, he is -- that -- that is the offense of which he

22

was convicted, and it is an offense in which the loss to

23

the victims exceeded $10,000.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

And so we think Does the judge, when he

arrives at the restitution amount, have discretion to
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

say, as to this particular defendant, he was just an

2

accountant with the company that was committing the

3

fraud, he didn't put anything into his own pocket except

4

the salary they paid him, so I'm going to exclude him

5

from the restitution order?

6

MR. GANNON:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in

7

general the -- the judge does have discretion to -- to

8

adjust aspects of the restitution order on the basis of

9

the facts of the underlying offense.

And that's -

10

that's one of the reasons why I think the board has been

11

sensitive to the idea that the restitution order does

12

not necessarily determine what the amount of loss is

13

going to be for purposes of -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you wouldn't allow

15

that exclusion to have any effect on deportation, would

16

you?

17

MR. GANNON:

18

of the underlying case.

19

in which the victims lost nor than $10,000 and we could

20

prove that by clear and convincing evidence in the

21

removal proceeding, then -- then we think that we would

22

not be bound by the judge's discretionary refusal to

23

impose a restitution requirement on the particular

24

defendant.

25

It would depend upon the facts
If the underlying fraud was one

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So in -- in my very

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hypothetical -

2

MR. GANNON:

Depending upon the facts of the

3

case, yes, Justice Ginsburg, in your hypothetical if we

4

can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the

5

amount of loss associated with a fraud offense was more

6

than $10,000, we think that would satisfy.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even -- even though this

8

defendant did not pocket any gain?

9

MR. GANNON:

Yes.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

10

It's not a pecuniary gain threshold.

11

victim threshold.

12

well take that into account for purposes of restitution,

13

it doesn't change the metric that Congress chose to

14

determine which types of frauds are serious enough to be

15

considered aggravated felonies.

16

It's a loss to the

And -- and although the judge may

In 1994, they -- they picked a threshold of

17

$200,000.

In 1996, they dropped that to 5 percent of

18

that value, to $10,000.

19

here is that if the fraud is so severe that it -

20

that -- that somebody -- that the victims lost $10,000,

21

then -- then that is a qualifying offense for purposes

22

of subparagraph (M)(i), even if the original criminal

23

sentencing judge, on the basis of all sorts of factors

24

associated with the case and under the restitution

25

standards, decided that the defendant was not

I think Congress's judgment

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

necessarily liable to pay restitution in that amount.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

3

defendant's argument that at least as far as his

4

admission for sentencing purposes, he did that only

5

because otherwise the government wouldn't ask for a

6

downward departure?

7

MR. GANNON:

Well, I -- I think that we are

8

not taking the position that the -- the stipulation for

9

sentencing purposes, which was pursuant to (6)(B)of the

10

guidelines and was for stipulation purposes -- we're not

11

arguing that that is -- is dispositive in the -- in the

12

civil removal proceeding.

13

persuasive evidence of the amount of loss here.

We're arguing that it's

14

And so, he's -- he is certainly able to say

15

before the board or before the immigration judge that -

16

that for some reason the amount that he admitted to

17

isn't really the -- the actual amount of loss associated

18

with the case.

19

has -- he has consistently tried to establish that -

20

that this -- these -- this gargantuan loss amount was -

21

was not one that was found by the jury, not that it was

22

not in fact the loss that actually accrued in

23

association with the -

24
25

That's not what he has done here.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He

But your position -- I

want to be sure I understand it -- is that if the record

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

in this case had been -- let's say it's a mail fraud

2

case, they proved one mailing and one victim lost $30,

3

and that's all the trial established, but as a matter of

4

fact you could establish this was part of a scheme, just

5

like the one we've got here, in which millions of

6

dollars were lost, you could prove that independently

7

and he would still be required to be deported?

8

MR. GANNON:
Stevens.

Not necessarily, Justice

amount of evidence in this case, we had sentencing

3

stipulations and all sorts of determinations at the time

4

of the sentencing where the defendant did not even try

5

to argue that this wasn't actually the amount of loss

6

associated with his offense and conviction, then we

probably would be able to establish by clear and

8

convincing that the -

as this one, but the evidence to prove the scheme only

required you to prove two or three mailings involving

JUSTICE STEVENS:

retry him for those other -- for that additional loss,

then that's -- I assume your argument is that that's

included within the offense for which he was convicted.

6

MR. GANNON:

As long as the offense were in

fact the scheme rather than an individual instance of a

mailing, that's correct; and so I think that that -

that that is consistent with Justice Stevens'

10

hypothetical and that we would in those circumstances be

11

able to -- attempts to prove by clear and convincing

12

evidence in the civil removal proceedings that the loss

associated with the offense, which was the scheme rather

14

than just an individual mailing, then -- then we would

15

be able to prove that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your position is that in

17

ancillary, subsequent proceedings anything you prove

18

that's within the offense convicted -- say, as measured

19

by double jeopardy purposes, as protection against

20

multiple prosecutions, that you can make that showing?

21

MR. GANNON:

Well, with -- here it's -

22

we're not trying to prove a separate criminal offense.

23

We're trying to prove that the offense -

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I take it that that's your

whole argument.

3

MR. GANNON:

Yes, that it -- this is the

4

offense of conviction.

This is just like the domestic

5

relationship prong of the misdemeanor crime of domestic

6

violence that the Court decided in its recent decision

7

in United States v Hayes, that -- that there is a prior

8

conviction, some aspects of which were elements of the

9

underlying offense, and in order to establish whether

10

the prior conviction needs the statutory definition in

11

the subsequent proceeding, the government will need to

12

bear the appropriate burden of proof for that

proceeding.

prosecution 38

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. GANNON:

-- because that was itself a

criminal proceeding, and that's right, Justice Ginsburg.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. GANNON:

Yes, yes.

We think that if this

6

definition were -- were to be applied in the criminal

7

context, then we would need to prove this aspect, the

8

loss threshold.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's what you're

10

talking about, the alien who is convicted of a

11

qualifying crime, an aggravating felony, then tries -

12

then comes back illegally.

years and 20 years, you admit there you would have to

14

prove beyond a reasonable doubt?

15

MR. GANNON:

The difference between two

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just to

16

be clear it's -- there's already a 10-year statutory

17

maximum that applies under 1326(b)(1) for the prior

18

conviction for a felony.

19

can easily be established through the categorical

20

approach and we would not need to have a "beyond a

21

reasonable doubt" determination in the illegal reentry

22

proceeding under 1326 to determine it's a felony.

23

I think that's something that

But in order to determine that it is an

24

aggravated felony, as long as we could not satisfy

25

through a categorical approach to demonstrate that it
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was an element of the offense in the original

2

proceeding, then, yes, I agree; we would need to meet

3

the relevant burden of proof in the 1326(b)(2)

4

proceeding.

5

Now, as it happens, this -- the extra

6

10-year statutory maximum at issue in 1326(b)(2)

7

effectively never gets litigated because the sentencing

8

guidelines arrange for aggravated felony enhancements in

9

that context for crimes like subparagraph (M)(1), ranges

10

from 21 months on the low end with no criminal history

11

to 5 months on the high end with criminal history of 6.

12

And so this effectively -- the extra 10 years of

13

statutory range is never employed by -- by judges for

14

these types of crimes.

15

In the last three years, according to

16

sentencing commission data, there isn't a single

17

defendant in the 1326 proceeding who received a sentence

18

of more than 10 years and had an increase on the basis

19

of an aggravated felony that would include the category

20

that we're dealing with here in subparagraph (M)(1).

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Gannon, we're

dealing with the definition of a particular term,

23

24

25

to prove that this is an aggravated felony is that it

2

the other provisions here talk about firearms offenses,

3

child pornography offenses, national security offenses,

particularly an aggravated felony.

MR. GANNON:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, the other elements -

I mean, it's a felony,

you have to prove with the protections of the criminal
law as opposed to the civil.

11

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think we have to prove

12

for purposes of the relevant proceeding in which we're

13

trying to establish that it is an aggravated felony that

14

it also exceeded the $10,000 threshold.

in the civil removal proceeding those protections aren't

there.

And so we CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm saying, the only thing that makes this aggravated,

the $10,000, in contrast to the other things, which are

2

aggravated by virtue of elements that you have to

approve -- you have to prove beyond a reasonable

4

doubt -- is that it's fraud ir deceit.

5

there's nothing about that that -- it's bad, but it

6

doesn't strike me as particularly aggravated.

7

MR. GANNON:

And as I said,

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there

8

are several other statutes here that have extra limiting

9

factors that are necessary to make the crime an

10

aggravated one for purposes of the aggravated felony,

11

but don't have to be proved as an element of the

12

original offense.

13

Congress has established -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's just --

14

I think that's kind of begging the question.

You assume

15

that those elements, those provisions also don't have to

16

be proved as elements.

17

guess, is that if the only thing that makes it

18

aggravated is -- is something you don't have to prove

19

beyond a reasonable doubt, it seems that we ought to

20

look, well, is that really aggravated?

And what I'm suggesting, I

21

MR. GANNON:

Well -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And when you're

23

talking about firearm offenses, or child pornography,

a run of the mine felony.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GANNON:

Well, but for many of the

In other words it seems to me you're already in the

you have to prove.

that that detracts from the point that "crime of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

you would not accept the Chief Justice's premise, that a

crime of violence is an aggravated felony.

10

MR. GANNON:

Well, I -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. GANNON:

It isn't.

I tried to explain that it is

13

not as long as there isn't a sentence that is imposed of

14

at least 1 year according to Congress's way of

15

determining what is an aggravated felony, and Congress

16

has determined that -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the -- but the Chief

18

Justice points out that the facts that make the fraud

19

aggravated are facts that you do not have to prove

20

beyond a reasonable doubt, which takes back to your

21

opponent's argument.

22

by proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the aggravated

23

felony that's the basis for the immigration order.

Therefore, you were not convicted

24

MR. GANNON:

Well, that's correct, Justice

25

Stevens, but in -- in that regard 45

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you were not convicted

2

of the aggravated offense that -- the issue in this

3

case.

4

MR. GANNON:

Well, no, we think that you

5

were convicted of the offense, which is an offense that

6

involves fraud or deceit, and then there is the further

7

limitation that Congress has imposed, not as an element

8

--

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the -- but you hadn't

10

been convicted of the aggravated offense until you

11

established its aggravation by proof of less -- not

12

under a reasonable doubt.

13

really is pretty important.

14

MR. GANNON:

So the word "convicted"

But it -- it can't have that

15

same meaning with regard to all of these other things in

16

all of these other offenses in which Congress has

17

determined they're not an aggravated felony until those

other criteria are also satisfied.

19

think that in a statute that indisputably involves

20

individual offenses that have both elements of the

21

offense and nonelement limiting factors in order to

22

limit the category to those that Congress would have

23

deemed to be aggravated, that it makes sense to not have

that generally wouldn't be for most of the other

on this statute, that it reads out all the mainstays of

patchwork of -

It depends on how you read

the language.

I guess -- I guess grammatically it could

be read either way.

to the victim exceeds $10,000.

You can read it:

an offense that

Or you could read it:

10

convicted of an offense that involves fraud or deceit,

11

in which the loss to the victim exceeds $10,000.

12
13

I mean, "convicted" doesn't necessarily
apply to the last -- to the last phrase.

14

MR. GANNON:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

And we -- and that's basically

what we're arguing about.

17

MR. GANNON:

And we think -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but the word

19

"convicted" -- the question is whether the word

20

"convicted" applies to the word "aggravated."

21

the point, as I understand the Chief Justice's

22

questioning, which goes to the burden of proof.

23

would win even under that approach if you said you had a

24

proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the other factors.

25

That's

But the thing that creates the -- the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

So you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

missing link is that to convert it from ordinary fraud

2

to aggravated fraud, you have to prove X under one view

3

by a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt, but, under

4

your view, by only clear and convincing evidence.

5

MR. GANNON:

Well, for purposes of a civil

6

removal proceeding, that's true, and that's no different

7

from the limiting factors in several of the other

8

provisions, like the sentence that was imposed -- the

9

potential sentence -- whether there was an exception for

10

a first offense that involved family members, for the

11

alien smuggling and document fraud, crimes in (N) and

12

(P).

13

And the -- this also is a reading that we

14

can't impose on subparagraph (M)(ii), where we know that

15

there is no loss requirement there, that the government

16

have a revenue loss of more than $10,000 for a crime in

17

which the loss to the government is $10,000.

The "in

And although Petitioner invokes the guilty

21

plea practice in the context of tax evasion offenses for

22

purposes of section 7201, this -- this doesn't help his

23

argument for the same reason that he cannot use

24

extraneous elements and guilty pleas generally to

25

establish that something was necessary for a conviction.
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

But if you look at the criminal tax manual that he

2

invokes, it makes clear by referring to relevant conduct

3

and the need for the loss amount there to include all of

the losses for all of the years in the indictment, even

5

if the defendant has pleaded guilty to an individual

count for a single year of tax evasion, that the loss

amounts that is typically included in guilty pleas in

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. MOSELEY:

With respect to the issue of

22

deference, the fact that this is part of a Federal

23

criminal statute I believe doesn't get us -- cuts off

24

the inquiry, and we don't get to Chevron deference here.

25

We deal with a dual use statute which has both civil and
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

criminal applications, so that under these

2

circumstances, certainly as this Court held in Leocal

3

and in Lopez-Gonzalez, Chevron deference with respect to

4

Babaisakov would not -- for example -- would not be

5

triggered.

6

I think, moreover, it's important to note

7

that the Babaisakov got (M)(ii) wrong -- got the -- the

8

requirement of a deficiency wrong, and also got wrong

9

the fact that there were no statutes involved where

10

fraud -- where a loss amount in excess of $10,000 would

11

be an element.

12

Finally, I think the government's reading of

13

this statute might make sense if Congress had said that

14

-- convicted of a crime in -- a crime in which fraud or

15

deceit is an element, with loss to be found at removal

16

proceedings in excess of $10,000.

17

language that Congress employed here, and under these

because we deal with a dual use statute, as this Court

22

Leocal, which indeed was also a civil removal

23

proceeding, or Lopez-Gonzalez, which was a civil removal
