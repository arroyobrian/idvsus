 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO 

7

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 
 MS. HO: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

10

 A promise of unalterable, costly healthcare 

11

benefits should be negotiated at the bargaining table, 

12

not imposed at the courthouse.  In a series of cases, 

13

the Sixth Circuit has required courts to infer from 

14

contractual silence a promise of vested benefits. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the  we're dealing 

16

with a case where there isn't silence.  I mean, it's a 

17

matter of construing what the words mean, but for 

18

example, this collective bargaining agreement says that 

19

the employees will receive a full company contribution 

20

toward the cost of health benefits.  That's not silent. 

21

 MS. HO: 

Your Honor, respectfully, it is 

22

silent with respect to the duration of the full company 

23

contribution toward benefits.  The word "receiving," 

24

which I understand Your Honor to be focusing on, 

25

indicates that the individual has to be retired; in

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other words, and actually receiving a pension and 

2

receiving a benefits.  It's not  it's not a durational 

3

term.  And so 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's what you say, but 

5

there was a hearing by the district court.  You're 

6

recommending we apply ordinary contract principles, no? 

7

 MS. HO: 

Yes.  There's  there's no 

8

disagreement and the courts of appeal don't  don't 

9

disagree that ordinary contract interpretation 

10
11

principles apply. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Assume  assume that I 

12

find those words ambiguous, you have a hearing.  The 

13

district court had a hearing, and it didn't  I don't 

14

think the district court relied on a presumption.  It 

15

relied on a bevy of evidence, including the fact that 

16

your company bought the predecessor company, assessing 

17

the health contributions at full value for retirees. 

18

 Why  why wouldn't ordinary contract 

19

principles permit the district court to do exactly what 

20

it did here? 

21

 MS. HO: 

Justice Sotomayor, I want to go 

22

back to  to the first part of your question which 

23

said, well, wasn't  wasn't there a trial here?  And 

24

our position is that it never  it never should have 

25

gotten to that because the district judge initially, as

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a matter of law, looked at the contract language here, 

2

declined to apply YardMan, and said, I don't find a 

3

promise of vesting. 

4

 On appeal, the Sixth Circuit said, we 

5

disagree.  Under YardMan, there is at least an 

6

inference of vesting here and instructed the district 

7

judge to apply YardMan on remand, which the district 

8

judge did, and on page 20 of Petitioner's appendix, in 

9

the opinion on remand, the district judge says, "Those 

10

directives," meaning the Sixth Circuit's directions in 

11

YardMan, "require this Court to reach the conclusion 

12

That the part that the plaintiffs here obtained vested 

13

benefits." 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Ho, I'm wondering if you 

15

would agree with this.  If we could start all over 

16

again, forget all the history that you just said, if we 

17

could start all over again, you, I think, just agreed 

18

that we would use ordinary contract principles; is that 

19

right? 

20

 MS. HO: 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Correct. 
Okay.  So ordinary contract 

22

principles, we would  first, we would look at the 

23

agreement, and if the agreement said something clearly 

24

either way, whether it was for vesting or against 

25

vesting, the agreement would control; is that correct? 

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. HO: 

That's correct.

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And if the agreement was 

3

ambiguous, we could take extrinsic evidence to clarify 

4

the terms of the agreement; is that correct? 

5
6

 MS. HO: 

Objective extrinsic evidence, yes, 

that's correct. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

Okay, so 

I wouldn't acknowledge that if I were you. 

10

 MS. HO: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12
13

You acknowledge that?  See, 

Well, Your Honor, I'm 
You don't believe in the 

parol evidence rule? 
 MS. HO: 

Objective  objective extrinsic 

14

evidence, Your Honor, would be  in other words, 

15

admissible  admissible on a finding of ambiguity. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

17

 MS. HO: 

Custom, practice. 
But I  but I think it's 

18

important, Justice Kagan, if I may, to point out that in 

19

the Sixth Circuit, and I think this is one way in which 

20

what happened here departs from ordinary contract 

21

interpretation , is that in the Sixth Circuit, the 

22

inference applies of vesting based either on text or 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

24

 MS. HO: 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, I hear you. 
 or extrinsic  extrinsic evidence. 
Yes, I hear you.  I was not 

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

getting you to agree with YardMan and I was not getting

2

you to agree to the Sixth Circuit. 

3

 MS. HO: 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Certainly, Your Honor. 
Yes.  But what  what I 

5

want to  is you look at the text, if the text says it 

6

either way, you go with the text; if the text doesn't 

7

say it either way, it's permissible to look at extrinsic 

8

evidence, like, the practice of the parties and, you 

9

know, what you sold this for and things like that. 

10

 MS. HO: 

Well, I  I would agree with you 

11

up to a point, and I think where  where I might part 

12

company or maybe add to that discussion would be to say 

13

that ordinary contract interpretation does say, I think, 

14

in McCutchen this Court referred to that, in 

15

StoltNielsen this Court applied the principle that 

16

where a contract is silent, courts apply the relevant 

17

default principles; in other words, silence  I just 

18

want to make clear that silence doesn't always equal 

19

ambiguity.  And our position 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but then you get to 

21

Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you, which is that 

22

this is a case where actually the parties are disputing 

23

language.  It's not really a case where there is 

24

silence.  I mean, you've come in and you've given some 

25

language that's very good for your side, which is that 

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

duration clause, and the other party has come in and

2

focused on the word "receiving" and focused on the tying 

3

arrangement between this and pensions, and focused on 

4

the surviving spouse clause.  So you have  you have 

5

some language, they have some language. 

6

 MS. HO: 

Well, I think, Your Honor, at a 

7

minimum, that's why we're entitled to reversal and a 

8

remand, if ­ if this Court declines to require a clear 

9

statement as  as part of  as part of ordinary 

10

contract interpretation.  I think we would at a minimum 

11

be entitled to have  have that look 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

13

 MS. HO: 

14
15

Where does 

 at the language without the 

YardMan inference. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Where does  where does 

16

ordinary contract interpretation require a clear 

17

statement? 

18

 MS. HO: 

Certainly, Your Honor, we think 

19

we think ordinary contract interpretation says where 

20

there is  where there is silence here, and there is no 

21

durational term, there's no indication of vesting, 

22

there's no indication of how long the full company 

23

contribution should last, that where there is silent 

24

silence, as this Court did in McCutchen, this Court looks to

25

see, well, what are the operative default rules that  that

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

we assume that if the parties didn't contract around 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, you keep saying 

3

when there is silence, and as Justice Kagan pointed out 

4

and as I pointed out, one side is not silent.  There are 

5

always indicia that vesting was intended. 

6

 MS. HO: 

I think there  there is 

7

silence  there is no question that there is silence in 

8

the operative term of the promise, which is a full 

9

company contribution toward healthcare benefits.  It's 

10

true that the other side has pointed to various textual 

11

cues that I think, if anything, Justice Ginsburg, 

12

underscore the lack of such terms in the one place in 

13

the contract where we would expect it to be.  And that 

14

is in the 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But I thought your ­but I 

16

thought your position here was that what the contract says 

17

under ordinary principles of contract interpretation is not 

18

the point.  The point is, is that in the first court of 

19

appeals case, they mention YardMan at least four times 

20

and said the YardMan presumption controls, and that's 

21

what the district court thought. 

22

 MS. HO: 

Yes. 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And the question  the 

24

principal question here is whether the YardMan 

25

presumption should have a  play a significant part in 

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the interpretation of this contract, and you say no.

2

 MS. HO: 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Correct. 
And there would be  and 

4

presumably there would be  we could make that decision 

5

in remand so that we don't interpret this contract 

6

initially without  without the benefit of what the 

7

district court and  and the court of appeals would say 

8

without the YardMan presumption if you prevail. 

9
10

 MS. HO: 

Certainly, Your Honor. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Unless, of course, the 

11

YardMan presumption is normal contract interpretation. 

12

That is, you know, the court of appeals could be saying 

13

that when you look at the totality of the contract where 

14

the benefits are being given for, as payment for work, 

15

you get them if you've worked so many years, they 

16

increase when you've worked more years.  Where that is 

17

the case, it is a reasonable assumption, call it a 

18

presumption if you like, that any promise to pay those 

19

benefits continues after the termination of the  of 

20

the union contract.  In other words, I'm not sure that 

21

the court of appeals would agree that  that this 

22

presumption is contrary to normal contractual 

23

interpretation.  I think the court of appeals would say 

24

that is normal contractual interpretation. 

25

 MS. HO: 

Justice Scalia, I think there's 

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I think you're right that the Sixth Circuit would and

2

has said that all it's doing in these cases is applying 

3

ordinary contract interpretation.  I think as Judge 

4

Sutton and others have pointed out, saying doesn't make 

5

it so.  And I think there can be no question when you 

6

look at the  when you look at the cases, and I think 

7

this case is a good example of the work that YardMan is 

8

doing.  And YardMan itself, Justice Scalia, in a 

9

footnote in its opinion, acknowledges that ordinary 

10

contract interpretation rules apply with respect to 

11

interpreting the contract generally.  But with respect 

12

to the issue here, which is the duration of the ­of the 

13

contract, the Sixth Circuit itself in YardMan said that 

14

the normal "strictures," was the word used, doesn't 

15

apply. 

16

 So I think at least as an initial matter, 

17

the Sixth Circuit did not conceive of this as ordinary 

18

contract interpretation and that it's really its own 

19

policybased rationales for why it's appropriate, in a 

20

sense, to put a thumb on the scales here in favor of 

21

retiree. 

22

 But I think if you look at ­if you look at the 

23

rules, maybe that's the most clear way to see that it's not 

24

ordinary, is saying to courts you can look at text or 

25

extrinsic evidence.  That's not normal contract 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interpretation. To say to courts you you can ignore a 

2

contract duration clause if it doesn't specifically refer 

3

to retiree health care benefits. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, we know that 

5

contracts have certain assumptions about them, about 

6

what continues.  Arbitration provisions continue after 

7

the expiration.  We have found that, correct? 

8
9
10

 MS. HO: 

Correct.  In the labor context, 

that's correct, whether the labor 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And Justice Scalia just 

11

said to you something that talks about retirement and 

12

the surviving spouse and her right to get things would 

13

 I think could reasonably be viewed  as a vesting 

14

provision. 

15

 MS. HO: 

I would respectfully disagree with 

16

that, Justice Sotomayor, for two primary reasons:  I 

17

think the first reason is that all of these other 

18

textual cues are reasonably read in conjunction with the 

19

contract, both with the contract expiration clause, 

20

which which says that the benefits are for the duration 

21

of the agreement; but even without that clause, are read 

22

in the context of the background rule 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

24

 MS. HO: 

25

See, that's 

 with respect to the terms 

expiring with the agreement. 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 that's the question for 

2

the following reason, okay?  I don't know whether there's a 

3

lifetime health benefit if this company stops providing 

4

any, meaning if the company some day says we're not 

5

going to give any whatsoever, the issue  that, I 

6

think, is a more interesting question because then the 

7

contract has truly expired.  But if it chooses to, it 

8

seems to me that the full benefits or  will receive a 

9

reduced  will receive a full company contribution, 

10

could suggest that that doesn't expire. 

11

 MS. HO: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13
14

We 
So long as the health 

as long as the company is providing health insurance. 
 MS. HO: 

Our position is the full company 

15

contribution language, as as the district judge in this 

16

case initially held when looking at that language, does 

17

not have a durational term that's not sufficient to 

18

imply vesting.  In this particular case, and I think 

19

Your Honor raised the issue of the term of the agreement 

20

and applying during that, in terms of going forwards, I 

21

just want to be clear, we have never sought to terminate 

22

the benefits, and, in fact, now the retiree benefits are 

23

the subject of mandatory bargaining 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But could you have  if 

the collective bargaining agreement has expired, you 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have your duration clause, and the company instead of

2

saying, retirees, we're going to make you contribute 

3

something to the health care, says:  Well, the contract 

4

expired; no health coverage at all for retirees.  Under 

5

your theory, I assume they could do that. 

6

 MS. HO: 

Well, under ERISA, where Congress 

7

said, unlike pension benefits, we're not going to 

8

require health care benefits to vest, the only way 

9
10
11
12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 
 MS. HO: 

But the fact 

 the only way the benefits vest 

is by contract. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is it your position that 

13

once the contract expires, the employer is free to say 

14

no health coverage for retirees, period? 

15

 MS. HO: 

If there has been no vesting, yes. 

16

In this case, the company, each successor company and 

17

the union, entered into a series of agreements 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But you answered the 

19

question.  The answer is yes, right?  The company can 

20

terminate.  You're saying it hasn't terminated here, 

21

it's a nice company; but it doesn't have to be a nice 

22

company, does it?  Isn't that your position? 

23

 MS. HO: 

Our position  I'm just trying to 

24

be consistent with the record in this case, Your 

25

Honor  is as a general matter, yes, the terms don't 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

outlest  outlast the terms of the agreement, but there 

2

is a difference in this case. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What I would like to hear, 

4

earlier you said there were two reasons:  One was the 

5

termination clause and second that the contract had to 

6

be read in light of the background rule  then you got 

7

cut off.  And I really want to know what the background 

8

rule you were about to refer to was. 

9

 MS. HO: 

Certainly, Your Honor.  I think 

10

there are two background rules in play here.  And the 

11

first rule is that we don't normally read into silence 

12

where parties have undertaken extrastatutory 

13

obligations or extraordinary undertakings.  We don't 

14

read those terms into silence.  We expect that if such a 

15

serious undertaking as a promise of health care benefits 

16

for life were to have been made, that we would expect to 

17

see it, just like this Court said in the Tern case about 

18



19
20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What's the second one 

before you get cut off again, what's the second one? 
 MS. HO: 

Certainly.  And I think the second 

22

background rule here is related to the first.  And 

23

that's the extrastatutory obligation here, that where 

24

Congress has said in ERISA, it's explicitly exempted 

25

welfare benefits from automatic vesting.  So, if the 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in other words, what's being asked for here is the

2

exception to the rule.  So we would expect to see that 

3

clear in the contract. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Ho, Congress has said, 

5

yes, in pension benefits, there's vesting.  And in 

6

health care benefits we leave it to the parties; is that 

7

right? 

8

 MS. HO: 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That's correct. 
So it doesn't have any 

10

implication for health care benefits other than we leave 

11

it to the parties, isn't that right? 

12

 MS. HO: 

I would respectfully  maybe I 

13

would not so much disagree as take that a step further. 

14

I think it does have an implication here because it 

15

establishes a default rule that, unless as a matter of 

16

contract there is an agreement to vest, then the 

17

benefits otherwise do not vest.  And I think we would 

18

expect, applying normal contract principles, would 

19

expect to see that clear on the face of the contract. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but then you're back 

21

to your first background rule, which is that we would 

22

expect to see this if it were there.  But you can  I 

23

mean, that seems  that statement has its corollary, 

24

right?  Which is that, you know, either party  we 

25

would expect, we would expect to see if the union had 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

won, that it would say vested.  We would expect to see

2

if the employer had won, it would say unvested. 

3

 And, indeed, I think that there's an amicus 

4

brief in this case that suggests that there was a survey 

5

done of all these agreements and about 60 percent of 

6

them say quite explicitly unvested.  Yours doesn't do 

7

that.  So there we are.  We're left with this ambiguity, 

8

and you have some language and they have some language 

9

and some judge has to figure it out. 

10

 MS. HO: 

Well, and I think  I think your 

11

question raises two issues, one of which goes back to 

12

our previous discussion about the role that ERISA has to 

13

play here.  And I think if you put the onus on the 

14

employer to say what's clear, you're in a sense saying, 

15

even though Congress doesn't require it to be vested, 

16

we're going to ask 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

18
19

Congress has said we don't 

care.  Congress has said we leave it to them. 
 MS. HO: 

Right, but there's no obligation to 

20

do it.  So normally we would expect to see the 

21

obligation on the party who wants the benefit to seek 

22

the clear language, to seek the promise, as opposed to 

23

the party who doesn't.  And I think if you sort of play 

24

that out in terms of as a practical matter, particularly 

25

in the context of negotiations, one would also expect to 

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

see the party who wants the benefit bargaining for the

2

benefits. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This is an important benefit

and an expensive one.  Why is it that in this collective 

5

bargaining agreement and apparently many others  I 

6

don't know whether the figure is 40 percent or whatever 

7

it is  there isn't anything explicit one way or the 

8

other? 

9
10

 MS. HO: 

I think 

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This certainly can't be 

11

something that didn't occur to the employer or to the 

12

union.  Why did they choose to leave it silent?  Why did 

13

they choose not to address it expressly? 

14

 MS. HO: 

I think there  one could consider 

15

that they didn't express it directly or one could read the 

16

contract as saying there simply is no  silence says 

17

there is no promise of vesting here, because that is an 

18

extraordinary obligation for a company to take on. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How about "Retirees will 

20

receive health benefits as long as they are eligible for 

21

and receiving a monthly pension"?  Doesn't that sound 

22

like as long as they're getting the pension, they will 

23

get health benefits? 

24
25

 MS. HO: 

No, Your Honor.  Again, read in 

conjunction with either the express clause in this case 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or the background rule that the terms expire with the

2

agreement, that doesn't indicate that those  those 

3

extend.  And I think what  what the Sixth Circuit has 

4

done, and it did in this case, it instructed this Court 

5

that the mere fact that the retiree healthcare benefits 

6

were tied to receipt of a pension was sufficient to 

7

indicate vesting.  I think that essentially undoes what 

8

Congress did in saying you  you have to vest in 

9

pension; you don't have to vest in the welfare context. 

10
11
12

 The Sixth Circuit essentially puts those 
things 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I don't think it's 

13

reversing that.  I think it's  it's an argument of 

14

of contractual expression, contractual intent.  It says 

15

if you tie the continuing receipt of health benefits to 

16

the continuing receipt of retirement benefits, and if 

17

you know that retirement benefits survive the 

18

termination of the contract, right?  You acknowledge 

19

that. 

20

 MS. HO: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The vesting. 
It seems to suggest that 

22

that health benefits continue as long as retirement 

23

benefits do.  Now, I mean, maybe there are other 

24

indications, but that one certainly seems to  seems to 

25

tie health benefits to retirement benefits. 

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. HO: 

I don't think so, Your Honor.

2

Because I think one con  one consequence of that is 

3

essentially no matter what the parties contract or agree 

4

to, you're always going to have vesting, even though 

5

it's the exception and not the rule, simply by tying the 

6

healthcare benefits to  to retirement status. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why do you have to  why 

8

do you have to do that?  If you want to treat them as 

9

separate, treat them as separate.  Don't tie them 

10

together.  There was nothing that required these two to 

11

be tied together. 

12

 MS. HO: 

Well, Your Honor, I think the 

13

practical reason for  for linking those two is not to 

14

indicate vesting, but to ensure that the recipient is 

15

is actually retired for purposes of receiving the 

16

benefits. 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I thought it was 

18

your position that whatever might be the outcome of 

19

these questions, the Sixth Circuit didn't think that 

20

that was the right analysis, that the Sixth Circuit 

21

didn't think the result could be reached without 

22

imposing the presumption of your argument, and so 

23

instructed the district court.  And that's the issue 

24

before us. 

25

 MS. HO: 

That's correct, Your Honor.  And 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the district court  and the district court made clear

2

on remand, and the Sixth Circuit in the second appeal, 

3

in Tackett II, explicitly approved, and the word the 

4

Sixth Circuit used was "presumption," that the district 

5

court decided correctly in applying the presumption to 

6

this case. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought that the 

8

district court on remand said it would have come out the 

9

same way anyway.  They said there are no facts that 

10
11

would defeat this same conclusion. 
 MS. HO: 

Correct, Your Honor.  And I  and 

12

I think that's an important response to what Justice 

13

Sotomayor was pointing out earlier about the fact that 

14

there was a trial here.  I think that  that language 

15

makes clear that the trial here was about what  what 

16

vested, and that's the district judge making clear that 

17

whatever facts there had been, it would have reached the 

18

same conclusion about vesting, which is the only issue 

19

before this Court based on the Sixth Circuit's 

20

directive, as Justice Kennedy was pointing out, to apply 

21

YardMan and to apply the YardMan presumption. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You know, the nice thing 

23

about a contract case of this sort is you can't feel bad 

24

about it.  Whoever loses deserves to lose. 

25

 (Laughter.) 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, this thing is

2

obviously an important feature.  Both sides knew it was 

3

left unaddressed, so, you know, whoever loses deserves 

4

to lose for casting this upon us when it could have been 

5

said very clearly in the contract.  Such an important 

6

feature.  So I hope we'll get it right, but, you know, I 

7

can't feel bad about it. 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, you know, the workers 

10

who don't discover they've been retired for five years and 

11

don't have any health benefits might feel a little bad 

12

about it. 

13
14
15
16

 MS. HO: 

And  and Your Honor, I  I 

agree. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm taking sides, but I 

want to 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean, what I've listened 

19

to sort of drives me to the conclusion where you 

20

started, decide these things without any presumption, 

21

period.  Ordinary contract.  Go read the contract. 

22

Where it's ambiguous, Judge, ask them for extrinsic 

23

evidence if they want to present it.  Decide it like any 

24

other case.  I started there.  Maybe I've heard 

25

something that should change my mind.  I often do change 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

1

it in oral argument, but I haven't yet.

2

 MS. HO:

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

And  and 
He agrees with you, doesn't 

he?  I mean, you're not going to argue that, are you? 

5

 MS. HO: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, Your Honor. 
So you say just have us 

7

decide it, and in this case, I've read an awful lot that 

8

you may well lose. 

9

 MS. HO: 

Well, I would  I would  I would 

10

say this  this, Your Honor.  There's no disagreement 

11

that ordinary contract interpretation principles apply. 

12

I think the  the dispute is over, number one, how the 

13

Sixth Circuit applied them in this case, and it used the 

14

YardMan presumption, which we disagree with.  But I 

15

think under  under either sort of  however much 

16

clarity is required in these contracts, I think in this 

17

case you only get to a promise of vested benefits by 

18

reverse engineering language elsewhere in the agreement 

19

that only highlights the lack of it where you would most 

20

expect to find it, and that ignores the contract 

21

expiration clause here, which makes clear it's a full 

22

company contribution during the term of the agreement. 

23

 And if I may reserve the rest of my time for 

24
25

rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIA P. CLARK 

4
5

7

Thank you.
Ms. Clark? 

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 
 MS. CLARK: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 As the Court has so aptly noted, this is a 

8

contract dispute, and our argument is simply that 

9

contract disputes relating to retiree health benefits 

10

should be decided like every other dispute under a 

11

collective bargaining agreement.  To determine what the 

12

parties intended without applying any presumptions 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Isn't that what Justice 

14

Scalia believes?  I tend to agree with him.  He said 

15

he said the other side is arguing the same thing, and 

16

and says since both sides want to argue the same thing, 

17

maybe we can just agree with them. 

18

 (Laughter.) 

19

 MS. CLARK: 

20
21

That's music to my ears, Your 

Honor. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, it may be 

22

music, but it  YardMan says that retiree healthcare 

23

benefits are not subject to the stricture of ordinary 

24

contract interpretation and  I mean, that's what 

25

YardMan says, and so I think you would have to vacate 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if we're going to say apply the normal principles of

2

contract interpretation. 

3

 MS. CLARK: 

I have two answers to that.  Let 

4

me start with what YardMan actually did.  If you read 

5

the entire opinion, and unfortunately it's rather long, 

6

it details a number of contract provisions in that 

7

contract which the Court found supported the intention 

8

of both parties to create a benefit that would last 

9

beyond the expiration of the collective bargaining 

10
11

agreement. 
 There was, for example  and this is kind 

12

of the  the most obvious contrast, the retiree benefit 

13

was described with some words like "continues."  The 

14

benefit for the surviving spouse of a retiree was stated 

15

to continue as long as this contract is in effect. 

16

 Now, the Court took that, rightly so, to 

17

suggest that the retiree would have a lifetime benefit, 

18

but that a surviving spouse, who was still alive after 

19

the retiree died, would continue to have benefits until 

20

the next agreement  I'm sorry, the agreement, because 

21

it kept  it kept rolling forward in agreements.  So 

22

the surviving spouse was limited to the term of a 

23

contract while the retiree was not. 

24
25

 There are a number of other contract 
provisions that they note, which very clearly supported 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the inference that the retiree's benefit was intended to

2

continue. 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I know you're 

4

saying that you win without YardMan, but  but it 

5

still seemed to mean something to the Sixth Circuit. 

6

And the many other courts of appeals that have addressed 

7

the question have distinguished what they're doing, 

8

saying, you know, we're not going to follow YardMan. 

9

We're going to apply normal principles of contract 

10
11

interpretation. 
 MS. CLARK: 

And, Your Honor, that was where 

12

I was getting to the second piece of my argument  the 

13

second piece of my answer to your question.  And that is 

14

that we believe, particularly based on the limited 

15

arguments that were made by Petitioner below, that this 

16

Court could affirm this decision on normal principles of 

17

contract interpretation, but if the Court wants to be 

18

sure that the judgment below is, in fact, based on 

19

normal principles of contract interpretation, we are 

20

perfectly comfortable with a remand for that purpose. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, the only point of 

22

this that I'm unsure of is that almost all of the other 

23

circuits require either a clear statement of vesting or 

24

at least words clearly susceptible to vesting.  One or 

25

the other. What do you  How do you stand on those two 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

principles of statutory construction 
 MS. CLARK: 

Number one  well, number two. 

3

I'm disagreeing with both parts of your  of the 

4

premises of the question. 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm saying what other 

6

I think other courts have done this, correct?  They have 

7

presumptions against vesting, some of the courts. 

8
9

 MS. CLARK: 

Some may.  Skinner Engine is 

really the only one that flatly says we're going to ask 

10

for clear and express language.  Even they will consider 

11

extrinsic evidence for the purpose of demonstrating an 

12

ambiguity.  The Skinner Engine opinion itself says that 

13

it would consider that; it just found the evidence in 

14

that case not sufficient. 

15

 But among the other circuits, I count five 

16

that apply traditional rules of contract interpretation 

17

and that only say  not clear language, not specific 

18

language  but say only we are looking, as in all other 

19

contract cases, for some language that is reasonably 

20

susceptible to the interpretation that's offered by the 

21

retirees.  And that's the classic formulation.  It's the 

22

one that we urge this Court to adopt.  And indeed 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is that  is that the 

24

Second and Seventh  are you saying essentially you 

25

agree with the position of the Second and Seventh 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Circuits?
 MS. CLARK: 

The Second Circuit, Justice 

3

Ginsburg, in the opinion in Joyce v. CurtissWright, 

4

articulated that precise standard.  It then, in a kind 

5

of a summary of its opinion, used the word "specific 

6

language," which has come to be cited to mean something 

7

more than language reasonably susceptible.  To that 

8

extent we would not agree with the Second Circuit.  As 

9

far as they went, relying on traditional principles, we 

10
11

agree with them. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is it a traditional 

12

principle of contract interpretation that if you're 

13

dealing with something as big a deal as healthcare 

14

benefits for life, you might expect that to be 

15

addressed  addressed more specifically? 

16

 MS. CLARK: 

Mr. Chief Justice, no.  There 

17

are many contract provisions that are a bigger deal than 

18

this.  I mean  and it is not the traditional rule of 

19

contract interpretation that the courts look to see 

20

which party had a bigger stake and punish them if their 

21

language is ambiguous.  Quite the contrary, it's treated 

22

like any other issue of contract interpretation:  Is the 

23

language reasonably susceptible to more than one 

24

interpretation? 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You want us to write an 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

opinion saying that whether or not health care benefits

2

survive in a collective bargaining agreement is not a 

3

big deal? 

4

 MS. CLARK: 

5

what I'm saying. 

6
7

No, Justice Kennedy, that's not 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I don't understand your answer to the question 

8

 MS. CLARK: 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

10
11

Well, then I'm thinking 

I'm simply 
 posed by the Chief 

Justice. 
 MS. CLARK: 

I am saying that there are many 

12

contract issues that come before the courts that are a 

13

big deal.  This is one of them, particularly for the 

14

retirees.  It is a big deal.  But the point is simply 

15

that traditional rules of contract interpretation don't 

16

treat ambiguity any differently when it is in a contract 

17

provision that's a big deal for one side or the other, 

18

or both sides. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that's exactly 

contrary to what your argument instructs. 
 MS. CLARK: 

Justice Kennedy, I think not.  I 

22

think that the  the essence of the YardMan inference, 

23

and that's the term that the court used, is not that 

24

different from what this Court recognized in the Nolde 

25

Brothers case and in the Litton case, which is that 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there are some terms in collective bargaining agreements

2

which by their nature are offering  may be; let me 

3

rephrase  by their nature may be offering something in 

4

exchange for service that's already rendered.  So if the 

5

performance is complete on one side and all that remains 

6

is for the other side to keep its end of the bargain, 

7

the Court in Litton and in Nolde recognized that those 

8

promises, as a normal rule, will continue.  They will 

9

not expire when the rest of the agreement expires. 

10

 And accordingly the Court, dealing with an 

11

issue of severance pay in Nolde, where all that there 

12

was in the contract was a promise that there would be 

13

severance pay proportional to years of service, said 

14

that when the employer closed the plant after the 

15

contract expired, that there was a possibility that that 

16

severance pay was intended still to be paid to people 

17

who had earned it, and therefore ordered arbitration of 

18

the dispute. 

19

 In Litton, the question was whether when the 

20

plant laid off a number of workers after the contract 

21

expired, was the employer obligated to arbitrate over 

22

the question whether seniority should have protected 

23

people in those layoffs.  The Court reached the 

24

conclusion that there was not the same kind of character 

25

of deferred compensation about layoffs, seniority in 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

layoffs, as there was in the notion of a severance pay

2

that people may have earned over time. 

3

 So the Court was ready without any explicit 

4

language in the contract, without any presumption, to 

5

say this is an issue that has to be determined by the 

6

processes that are normally applied to determine 

7

ambiguous contract promises.  Does this promise 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's the general 

9

principle of what custom or practice in the industry or 

10

something like that, which I guess  I guess that's an 

11

ordinary principle of contract interpretation that could 

12

be applied. 

13

 MS. CLARK: 

Mr. Chief Justice, it certainly 

14

is one of the principles that this Court has said must 

15

be considered in the case of all collective bargaining 

16

agreements.  TransportationCommunications Union said 

17

practice, usage and custom should always be considered 

18

for interpreting collective bargaining agreements, and 

19

we are fully behind that. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21
22

Is there a practice on 

this  on this subject? 
 MS. CLARK: 

Yes, there is evidence of a 

23

practice on this subject, Justice Scalia.  The  in 

24

this case  there are two things.  One is the sales 

25

agreement, which Justice Sotomayor pointed out during 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

the Petitioner's argument, where 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay, I'm not talking 

I'm talking 

4

 MS. CLARK: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

 MS. CLARK: 

Okay. 
 about in the industry. 
Okay.  In the industry in 

7

general, this is  this is rubber industry language. 

8

You will see it in many of the reported decisions that 

9

come out of the Sixth Circuit that  because there were 

10

a number of rubber companies headquartered in Ohio.  And 

11

the combination of "the retiree will receive health 

12

benefits" combined with "and the surviving spouse will 

13

receive them until death or remarriage," is a very 

14

common formula in the 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah, but Sixth Circuit we 

can't rely on because of YardMan. 
 MS. CLARK: 

Well, Your Honor, I would say, 

18

number one, that those two provisions combined certainly 

19

do say a lot about the duration of the promise that the 

20

employer was making.  The sales agreement here 

21

specifically reflected that the credit on the purchase 

22

price which M&G received was calculated based on 

23

actuarial assumptions that these were lifetime benefits 

24

with no retiree contributions. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

This may be an unfair 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question, but following up on what Justice Scalia is

2

getting at, I don't know how many others of those rubber 

3

companies are requiring contributions of active 

4

employees that are different than the contributions of 

5

retired employees.  Do you have any information about 

6

that? 

7
8
9
10

 MS. CLARK: 

I do not, and it's certainly not 

in this record. 
 So the second  the second point of 
practice 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

12

 MS. CLARK: 

Please. 
The second point of practice 

13

that I want to point out is this:  The 1997 collective 

14

bargaining agreement omitted all reference to retiree 

15

health benefits for people who had retired before 

16

January 1, 1996.  So beginning in '97 and in 2000 you 

17

have a collective bargaining agreement which says people 

18

who retire 1196 and after will receive the following 

19

health benefit.  The record is undisputed that, even 

20

though the contract was silent beginning in 1997, the 

21

employer continued to pay retiree healthcare benefits to 

22

those people who retired before 1997, and indeed that 

23

liability was transferred from Shell to M&G as part of 

24

the sale. 

25

 That is a point that we made. 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

It's 

Official

1

undisputed.  Petitioner did not respond to it in any

2

way.  So we do have that kind of evidence of what the 

3

parties have done under this agreement. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And is it right that 

5

Petitioners' original arguments were not that they 

6

didn't have to pay these at all, but only that these 

7

benefits were capped at a certain level; is that right? 

8

 MS. CLARK: 

That is correct.  And, indeed, 

9

that was the issue that  on which the company moved to 

10

dismiss the complaint in the first instance.  It was the 

11

issue on which the district court initially dismissed 

12

finding that there were cap letters that limited the 

13

amount that the employer had to pay; that, when it was 

14

tried before the district court, the district court 

15

rejected all of that evidence on credibility grounds and 

16

found that, based on the credibility of the witnesses, 

17

this was a lifetime obligation which everybody had 

18

understood until the employer found a way to try to 

19

reduce its costs, and 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can I ask  you a question 

21

about retirees?  I don't know if it's industry standard 

22

or just this contract.  Are retirees eligible to vote on 

23

the agreements that are entered into by the union? 

24

 MS. CLARK: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

They are not. 
They are not. 

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And is that generally true of retirees?

2

 MS. CLARK: 

Generally, that is true because 

3

they are not members of the bargaining unit once they 

4

retire, and only members of the bargaining unit are 

5

represented in bargaining or have any right to vote on 

6

the ratification of an agreement. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And do they  does the 

8

union represent them in any other disputes they may have 

9

as retirees with  because generally, the union 

10
11

represents employees, active employees? 
 MS. CLARK: 

Yes, it does.  It is the agent, 

12

and that in the statutory term, as well as the common 

13

law term, for the employees in the bargaining unit. 

14

Once an individual retires, the union is no longer his 

15

or her agent.  The union no longer has any authority nor 

16

any obligation to represent the retiree.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So  so in a way, you 

18

would expect the union to give this away so  so it can 

19

get higher benefits for the people that are still in its 

20

bargaining unit, wouldn't you? 

21

 MS. CLARK: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MS. CLARK: 

That is one of the concerns. 
Well, that's a cynical 
No.  That  that, indeed, is 

24

one of the things that YardMan points out, is that 

25

is that that is a reason to assume that the parties 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would want to make this clear in the agreement.

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 MS. CLARK: 

Right, right. 
And  and, in fact, you know, 

4

to  to be clear, there are agreements in which the 

5

union and the employer agree in advance that the 

6

retirees will have these benefits until and unless the 

7

union and the employer bargain something else.  And 

8

that's just a different species of contractual vesting. 

9

There is a condition.  It's imposed at the time of 

10

retirement.  The benefit is paid consistently with that 

11

condition. 

12

 There are, at the opposite end of the 

13

spectrum, agreements, and I tried a case in which this 

14

was the  this was the understanding.  When the retiree 

15

went out the door, that package of benefits was exactly 

16

what that retiree was going to have for the rest of his 

17

or her life.  No changes permitted by any means 

18

whatsoever. 

19

 And  and so the span and the spectrum of 

20

contractual vesting in this area is very broad.  And our 

21

point to you is to say there is no onesizefitsall 

22

solution here.  It is what the parties agreed to.  And 

23

if there is ambiguity in the collective bargaining 

24

agreement, as there plainly was here with provisions 

25

that could be read on each side, then it goes to the 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

processes which the common law has established over

2

hundreds, if not thousands, of years to say we're going 

3

to consider the entire agreement. 

4

 We don't compartmentalize some other 

5

provisions in the agreement and say, oh, wait a minute, 

6

they don't have anything to do with this.  If they give 

7

a clue about what the parties had in mind with respect 

8

to the retiree health benefits, they must be considered. 

9

They must all be put into the mix of what the Court will 

10
11

determine. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is  is one of  is one 

12

of the ingredients that goes into this mix the 

13

background rule that I  I thought your friend would 

14

bring up, and that is it is the normal rule in contract 

15

interpretation that when the contract expires, so do its 

16

terms.  If you start with that, contract expires, all 

17

its terms expire.  Isn't that 

18

 MS. CLARK: 

This Court addressed that in 

19

Litton.  And the clear ruling of the Court there was 

20

that exceptions to that rule are determined by normal 

21

contract interpretation. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what about the 

23

arbitration context of Litton?  I mean, the idea is, 

24

well, of course, it doesn't expire because you might 

25

have disputes, particularly disputes going in connection 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with the expiration.  So the idea in Litton, that the

2

arbitration requirements continue, really can't be 

3

applied outside that context. 

4

 MS. CLARK: 

Certainly, to the extent that 

5

Litton says we're going to presume that the arbitration 

6

promise continues, that does not apply here. 

7

 But the second level of consideration in 

8

Litton, you know  so the first question was the Court 

9

says arbitration, we're going to presume it continues 

10

unless the parties have made it very clear that it 

11

doesn't, so that it can kind of clean up all the 

12

disputes under the parties  that  that the parties 

13

have. 

14

 But then the second layer was is the 

15

particular contract provision in dispute here, there the 

16

seniority provision that I mentioned a moment ago, the 

17

kind of contract provision that we believe may have some 

18

postexpiration binding effect on the employer.  And the 

19

Court contrasted Nolde, in which it was severance pay, 

20

noting that that was in the nature of a deferred 

21

compensation claim, and also pointed out that if a 

22

particular contract right may be deemed to have accrued 

23

or vested while the agreement was in effect, it would 

24

normally remain in effect. 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So is this the language 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you're referring to, "Exceptions are determined by

2

contract interpretation, rights which accrued or vested 

3

under the agreement will, as a general rule, survive 

4

termination of the agreement"? 

5

 MS. CLARK: 

That is one of the passages that 

6

we're referring to.  We're also referring to a passage 

7

on page 203 of the Court's opinion, which says, "A 

8

similar duty, i.e., a constraint on the employer after 

9

the expiration date," which is the sentence before, "may 

10

arise as well from the express or implied terms of the 

11

expired agreement itself."  Express or implied. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Go back to something that 

13

you said earlier that I wasn't sure I understood from 

14

reading the briefs.  You said that this was a standard 

15

form contract that arose in Ohio for rubber companies; 

16

is that right? 

17

 MS. CLARK: 

That's close.  I mean, the 

18

rubber industry bargained as a group.  There were a 

19

number  and there were pattern bargaining.  It was 

20

just common in a number of industries, you know, one 

21

large employer might be the lead company in a round of 

22

bargaining.  And Goodyear was involved, as you know, in 

23

the early contracts here. 

24
25

 So there's a bargaining with one big 
employer, and it sets a pattern.  And then the other 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

companies in the industry bargaining with the same union

2

may adopt that pattern.  And that goes for wages and 

3

and all of the economic terms of the agreement, as well 

4

as benefits and working conditions and everything else 

5

in the contract. 

6

 This language about retiree health benefits 

7

shows up in a large number of the rubber contracts, and 

8

because they were headquartered in Ohio, not to be 

9

surprising, they  they 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And did these contracts 

arise before or after YardMan? 
 MS. CLARK: 

These  the initial contracts 

13

were preYardMan.  They've obviously been renegotiated. 

14

For instance, the 95point rule in this agreement was 

15

postYardMan.  I mean, it was bargained to 

16

previously, it was somebody with at least 10 years of 

17

service gets 100 percent paid, and they made that a 

18

little bit less generous for people who are hired after 

19

the change was made.  They adopted the 95point rule 

20

with  as you know, it's proportional to that for 

21

people with less than 95 points in age and service. 

22

 So it's  there  changes were made, but 

23

the basic pattern of retiree gets these benefits with a 

24

full company contribution, the language about the 

25

retiree receiving a pension, which, in my mind, very 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plainly does speak to duration, as does surviving

2

spouse, until death or remarriage.  I don't know how you 

3

read those words to mean anything other than duration. 

4

 So there is enough in this contract to 

5

support the interpretation that the retirees placed on 

6

it.  The Court properly tried the case, received 

7

extrinsic evidence, ruled that it was, indeed, a 

8

lifetime promise.  If this Court has any doubt whether 

9

traditional principles of contract interpretation were 

10

applied without presumptions, as I said earlier, we 

11

would be willing to welcome a remand for a determination 

12

under traditional principles of contract interpretation. 

13
14
15
16

 If the Court has no further questions, I 
believe that concludes my argument. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, 

Ms. Clark. 

17

 Ms. Ho, you have four minutes remaining. 

18

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLYSON N. HO 

19

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 

20

 MS. HO: 

21

 Three points: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
First, I think at a minimum 

22

we're not hearing a lot here today defending YardMan. 

23

I think there can be little serious question that 

24

YardMan infected every aspect of the proceedings below. 

25

Indeed, it was dispositive.  So I think at  at a 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

minimum we're entitled to  to a vacatur and remand for

2

ordinary contract principles to be require  to be 

3

applied. 

4

 We think that requiring clarity is 

5

consistent with those principles, but even as a matter 

6

of sort of what  what Respondent has suggested in 

7

terms of reasonably susceptible, the standard that 

8

Justice Sotomayor mentions, I think it will be important 

9

if this Court remands for consideration of ordinary 

10

contract interpretation, that it's clear that what the 

11

Sixth Circuit has been doing under that banner is 

12

anything but; that looking at putting text on a par with 

13

extrinsic evidence is not ordinary contract 

14

interpretation; that ignoring contract expiration 

15

clauses, unless they specifically reference healthcare 

16

benefits, is not ordinary. 

17
18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not sure that's 

true.  I 

19

 MS. HO: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Respectfully 
The language of vesting 

21

has to be reasonably susceptible from something in the 

22

contract. 

23

 MS. HO: 

Correct, Your Honor.  We  we 

24

absolutely agree with that, and we  and we believe 

25

here the full company contribution language, which is
